A stew of virtual assistants Google and Amazon are wrestling to be your smart home assistant, and companies like Apple and Microsoft aren't far behind. But you shouldn't commit to just one company. Tyler Lizenby/CNET Smart Home by Ashlee Clark Thompson May 16, 2017 11:31 AM PDT @AshleeEats Enlarge Image The Google Home (right) and the Amazon Echo both want to be your one-and-only smart home hub. Tyler Lizenby/CNET It's appropriate that the CNET Smart Home is located in Louisville, Kentucky -- the concept of the home is a bit like a Kentucky dish called burgoo. This stew is a medley of whatever meat you have on hand (be it beef, pork, chicken, mutton, rabbit or a combination) and some mixture of tomatoes, corn, potatoes, onions and lima beans. You throw your ingredients together in a pot, cook it for hours and boom, there's dinner. Smart home technology might be flashier than a catch-all country stew, but the idea is the same. Companies large and small have rushed to create products that take ordinary household items and connect them to the internet and one another. The sheer quantity of products available means that a smart home isn't much more than a burgoo of plugs, lights, switches, cameras and whatever else you want to buy to piece together a system that works for you. Companies like Google and Amazon have made a case for bringing some order to the smart home mishmash with help from their virtual-assistant-powered smart speakers. The Google Home and Amazon Echo can each be a unifying device that ties together all of these internet-connected devices. They can control smart home devices like thermostats or light bulbs directly, or through other families of products like Wink and SmartThings as well as automation programs like IFTTT. Google and Amazon's approach encourages monogamy in your smart home. Pick a smart home speaker, then outfit the rest of your home based on what devices are compatible to your smart speaker's AI. Turn a smart-home burgoo into bisque. This is the wrong approach, at least right now. More from Google I/O 2017 Google I/O 2017: What to expect Google Home and Assistant one year later: What now? A look back at Google I/O highlights See all Google I/O 2017 news Google is rumored to be expanding the use cases for its Google Assistant, the digital helper that's the brains behind the Google Home smart speaker, at tomorrow's I/O annual developers conference. Google Assistant competes against Amazon's Alexa voice assistant, Apple's Siri and Microsoft's Cortana. Each assistant represents just a sliver of what's possible when you combine artificial intelligence, voice commands and internet-connected devices. But you'd be happier if you used more than one manufacturer's AI and products for your smart home. Yes, it would be great to have a centralized smart home system in which you'd only have to interact with one main device, such as a smart speaker, or a unified interface, like Apple's HomeKit. And there are products that have attempted to be that whole-home solution, such as the custom, expensive Control4 luxury home automation system. But we're still a ways away from the Disney movie fantasy of a smart home that predicts our every move and automatically operates every component of the house. As we've seen at the CNET Smart Home, there isn't a universal system that connects every product to the smart speaker or smart assistant of your choice. We ask Siri to open the shades, Alexa to start a sous-vide water bath and Google Home to walk us through recipes. Though we're seeing more products that work with more than one assistant (just take a look at iDevices), some integrations just work better than others. And there is some freedom in being able to pick and choose the assistant that works best for you and your devices. 18 Here's everything the Google Home can do It can be a headache to have to choose from so many assistants and speakers and platforms. But there's beauty in this stew. The tech giants are scrambling to outdo one another's AI, which means their platforms will keep improving. In the past couple of weeks, Amazon has announced two new iterations of its Echo line of speakers (the Echo Look and the Echo Show) and a Echo-to-Echo call feature. Google has recently added a recipe feature to its Google Assistant, and we expect the company to announce more updates to the AI tomorrow. We still haven't seen the smart speaker that will house Cortana, and a Siri-powered smart speaker is rumored to debut this year. You can pick products that work for you, and bounce from assistant to assistant to get the best use out of them. It would be silly to tie yourself down to just one system when there are updates and new products coming out so frequently. This variety of products will let you build an a-la-carte smart home experience that's more personalized than you would get if you stuck with just one AI. It's OK if you prefer to use Siri to turn the lights on, but you want to tell Google Assistant to play Marvin Gaye through your Google Home. Now is the time to build and embrace your own smart-home burgoo. 21 These smart home gadgets work with both Siri and Alexa Share your voice 0 comments Tags Google I/O 2017 Smart Home Amazon Google Microsoft Apple HomeKit More stories 'Alexa, what did I miss?'

(Source: Reuters) Google’s artificial intelligence software is already inside Android phones, smart speakers and watches. At the Google I/O conference this week, the Alphabet Inc. unit plans to bring it to at least three more places: iPhones, coffee tables and kitchens. The Mountain View, California-based company is set to announce a version of its AI-powered assistant for Apple Inc.’s iPhone as soon as Wednesday, according to a person familiar with the matter. Google’s voice-based Assistant, unveiled at last year’s I/O and released in the fall, competes with Apple’s Siri and Amazon.com Inc.’s Alexa. It is set to land on the iPhone as a free, standalone app that can be downloaded from Apple’s App Store, according to the person. It would arrive first in the U.S., but Google is working on adding support for other countries in the future. Like the Assistant on Google’s own Pixel smartphones, the iPhone version will take commands via voice, the person said. The difference is that it won’t come pre-installed on the iPhone, a potential barrier to wide adoption. Still, the Assistant app will integrate with other Google apps on the iPhone so a user could ask to see a video and it will begin playing via YouTube. Google’s AI will show up in other new products this week. The company’s popular Photos app will be upgraded with a feature for creating physical coffee table photo books, according to the person familiar. Last year, Google upgraded the AI software supporting Photos so the service could automatically create albums by combining relevant and related images. Users will be able to order physical, printed books of pictures from the Photos app to be shipped to their homes, the person said. Google plans to offer multiple types of book materials for the service, with one option costing $10 per book, the person added. Apple, in the past, offered a similar service for its iPhoto application on Mac computers, but the company discontinued the feature about a year ago. It’s available on the company’s newer Photos app. Google is another big rival for Shutterfly Inc., which offers a digital photo storage service, photo books and calendars. When Amazon launched a competing offering last year, Shutterfly shares slumped more than 10 percent in a day. On Tuesday, Shutterfly stock dropped as much as 4.8 percent to $49.33, the most in more than three months. Google is also integrating its Assistant into GE home appliances such as refrigerators, dishwashers, ovens, washers and dryers. Users will be able to ask the Assistant how many cleaning pods are left in the dishwasher, or tell it to pre-heat the oven to 350F, or ask if the laundry is clean. News website Android Police earlier reported that Google’s Assistant will be coming to the iPhone. A Google spokeswoman declined to comment.

Google I/O, the company’s annual developer’s conference begins May 17 till May 19 at the Shoreline Amphitheater in Mountain View, California. While I/O is squarely aimed at the developers community, Google usually makes big announcements about its major products and services. Of course, rumours and leaks have been plenty ahead of this year’s conference as well. Here’s a look at some of the announcements we’re expecting to see when Google kicks off the conference. The highlight of the event will be Wednesday’s keynote, set for 10 am (local time)/10:30 p.m. IST. Android O We can definitely expect some announcements about Android O, the next-generation of Google’s mobile operating system for smartphones and tablets. Though Google already released the first developer preview of Android O, I/O is the platform where we will learn more about the OS. As we’ve seen in the preview, major improvements to battery and notifications are likely to be the key focus. Plus, Google could spend some quality time about Android O’s Bluetooth audio capabilities. We’ll also probably find out when Android O gets released for consumers, which is usually around the October-November time frame. Google could spend some quality time about Android O’s Bluetooth audio capabilities. Google Assistant Sundar Pichai has been quite vocal about Artificial intelligence (AI), integrating everything from search results to chat apps to Google Assistant and the Home speaker. At this year’s developers conference, Google will probably announce that Assistant is coming to the iPhone and it could also make its way to third-party appliances like GE home appliances, according to Bloomberg. The intention is to make an entire platform based on AI and voice-control. It’s not clear if we’re going to hear about the second-generation Home speaker. Android Wear Android Wear has been something Google hasn’t been able to communicate well with its consumers. Although Android Wear has been well adopted by electronic makers and Swiss watchmakers, the platform still hasn’t matured yet. Earlier this year, Google launched a revamped version of the OS – Android Wear 2.0 – following an official announcement at Google I/O 2016. The OS featured a new interface, watch face Complications, the Google Assistant, and a Wear Google Play store. Given the OS is only beginning to roll out, it’s unlikely Google will release a new software version of Android Wear. Google will largely discuss how developers can take advantage of the OS’ features like Google Assistant and standalone apps. Daydream Of late, there hasn’t been much news about Google’s VR platform, Daydream. Since its debut at last year’s I/O, the platform has been exclusive to the Google Pixel and a few other handful of devices. On May 18, the second day of I/O, Google has planned an augmented reality and virtual reality keynote, where we can expect to hear a lot of updates to the Daydream platform. Fuchsia After Android and Chrome, Google is silently working on the third, operating system, currently codenamed Fuchsia. It’s possible that Google could use the opportunity to reveal Fuchsia, which is touted to have a card-based ‘Armadillo’ UI.  The OS is based on Google’s ‘Magenta’ kernel instead of Linux like Android. Chrome OS Google’s Chrome OS has been a massive success in the education space. Sure, the OS has surpassed Macs in terms of popularity, but it still hasn’t been able to run Android apps as smoothly as it should be in the first place. This year’s conference will likely convince developers how they can modify their apps for a laptop-sized screen. Also, there have been strange rumours about Google merging Android and Chrome into one operating system, dubbed as “Andromeda.” One of the key  features of the OS will be to run Android apps to work on Chrome.

At this year’s annual Google I/O developers conference, which kicks off tomorrow in Mountain View, Calif., we’re hoping to get a clearer understanding of what Pichai meant. (The keynote starts Wednesday, May 17 at 10 am PT, 1 pm ET.) We’ve seen the concept of AI-first computing fleshed out a bit with Google’s Assistant software that runs on the Google Home device and later versions of Android. But for the most part, the idea of “AI first” remains abstract. Ideally, we’ll come out of I/O with a better big-picture understanding of what this new direction for Google means. At the very least, we’ll come back with a smattering of new details that point in the direction of where Google is headed. Don’t expect new hardware devices, as Google tends to save those announcements for its fall hardware event. (There are exceptions: Google did announce the Home device at last year’s I/O.) But we don’t think there will be a Home with a screen popping up, for example, to compete with Amazon’s new Echo Show. Here’s what we’re expecting: Google, Google, everywhere. Expect Google to announce that it’s pushing Assistant to more hardware. Bloomberg reported that Google will unveil integrations with the iPhone and GE home devices including dishwashers, ovens, washers and dryers. That means users will be able to talk to their appliances, telling the oven to preheat or asking if the laundry is done, for example. More Home features. The Information reported last month that Google planned to add Wi-Fi capabilities to Home so that the device can be used to extend a household’s Wi-Fi network. This may be an announcement at I/O. Tensorflow. For software developers, Google may have news pertaining to its open-source machine learning framework Tensorflow, which Google uses for AI capabilities like recognizing objects and people in photos and understanding language. This could include announcing that Tensorflow will be supported by more platforms, which would mean developers could have more flexibility in the devices on which they run programs they build with Tensorflow. More AI smarts in more places. In general, expect Google to announce that it is expanding its application of AI technology in more places, and that Google products are getting more automated. The whole point of AI is that it’s supposed to do most of the work. VR and AR. We may learn that more phone manufacturers are releasing or updating phones with features compatible with Google’s Daydream virtual reality platform. What would also be interesting is to find out whether Google plans to release more open-source VR or AR software. Google has already made its VR art software Tilt Brush open-source. Android O. Earlier this year, Google released a developer preview of Android O, the latest version of the Android operating system under development. We already know a little bit about O, which doesn’t yet have a full name: It’s being designed for improved battery life and is expected to have simplified app-notification settings, for example. We may learn more about it at I/O. Enterprise. Pichai wrote in his founders’ letter last year that enterprise — cloud computing and workplace software and tools — is a prime place to see AI advances take hold. Automated features figured prominently in announcements earlier this year at Google’s cloud conference, Next. Some announcements could be focused on workplace productivity or cloud computing. Wild card. All of these predictions and hunches are pretty straightforward. But Google tends to have something more exciting at I/O than mere iteration of what we already know the company is doing. So, what’s the wild card here? One guess is that Google could announce a new operating system. Ars Technica published photos of a reported open-source smartphone OS from Google, supposedly called “Fuchsia.” Join Recode for live coverage of I/O beginning Wednesday, May 17 at 10 am PT, 1 pm ET.

The Linux Foundation “The question of whether Software Defined Networking is a good idea or not is closed. Software Defined Networking is how we do networking,” said Amin Vahdat, Fellow & Technical Lead For Networking at Google, during his Open Networking Summit (ONS) keynote.  At Google, they’ve gone head first into the cloud through the Google Cloud Platform, which Vahdat says has expanded their network in new and exciting ways. They built one of the largest networks in the world over the past decade to support Google services, like web search, Gmail, and YouTube. But with the move to the cloud, they are now hosting services for others, which is pushing them into new functionality and capabilities. Google’s cloud architecture is built around disaggregation with storage and compute spread across the entire data center. It doesn’t matter which server holds a particular piece of data, because they’re replicating the data across the entire data center. The networking challenge with this approach is that the bandwidth and latency requirements for accessing anything anywhere increase substantially, which pushes their requirements for networking within the data center, Vahdat points out. Software Defined Networking (SDN) has been evolving at Google. Vahdat says that in 2013, they presented B4, a wide area network interconnect for their data centers. In 2014, it was Andromeda, their network virtualization stack that forms the basis of Google Cloud. In 2015, Google had Jupiter for data center networking. Now, they have Espresso, which is SDN for the public Internet with per-metro global views and real-time optimization across many routers and many servers. “What we need to be doing, and what we will be doing moving forward, is moving to Cloud 3.0. And here the emphasis is on compute, not on servers,” Vahdat says. This allows people to focus on their business, instead of worrying about where their data is placed, load balancing among the different components, or configuration management of operating systems on virtual machines. With networking playing a critical role in Cloud 3.0, there are a few key elements to think about: storage disaggregation, seamless telemetry, transparent live migration, service level objectives, and more. Vahdat suggests that, “the history of modern network architecture is going to begin at ONS. In other words, this community has been responsible for defining what networking looks like in the modern age and it's really different from what it has been.” Watch the video to see more about how networking and the cloud are evolving at Google. Interested in open source SDN? The "Software Defined Networking Fundamentals" training course from The Linux Foundation provides system and network administrators and engineers with the skills to maintain an SDN deployment in a virtual networking environment. Download the sample chapter today!

(AP) - Google is about to provide the latest peek at its digital services and gadgets as it seeks to become an even more influential force in people's lives. The overview will come Wednesday during Google's annual conference for thousands of computer programmers. Google is expected to give the crowd a look at new twists in its Android software for mobile devices. Executives are also likely to detail plans for expanding the reach and capabilities of a voice-controlled digital assistant currently available on some smartphones and an internet-connected speaker called Home. Some of the unveiled products won't be out until later this year. Many of Google's products are vying against similar offerings from Apple, Amazon and Microsoft.

The Google Home has a built-in library of relaxing ambient audio Paul Quinn Follow View All Posts 2017/05/06 7:26am PDTMay 6, 2017 47 Plus 1 on G+ 147 Share on Facebook 66 Share on Twitter Total Shares260 Google Home Videos Update 1: 2017/05/06 10:12am PDT While Google's support page says the feature is limited to Google Homes in United States, there are reports of it working outside 'Murica as well. Feeling like you want to relax after you've finished that meal you prepared with Google Home's help? Overwhelmed by your Home's answer to what's on your schedule tomorrow? Just ask it to help you relax with some soothing ambient sounds. Currently offering a catalog of 15 different ambient sound themes, Google Home can now replace your sound machine. The ambient sound themes include nature sounds, water sounds, fireplace sounds, and country sounds. The latter of those is crickets, lots of crickets. The ocean sounds theme must be based on heavy seas because I found that one a little too stimulating. If you're feeling lucky (that's Google Play Music lingo), you can just say, "Help me relax," and your Google Home will select a theme for you. Do you want to fall asleep to relaxing sounds? No problem. You can tell your Google Home to play one of these relaxing themes for a specified amount of time. For example, you can say, "Hey Google, play forest sounds for two hours." You'll hear the sounds of the forest for two hours, and then your Home will slowly fade out the audio. If you don't specify a time limit, it will default to one hour. Google has even included this helpful video on their support page. Let Tech With Brett take it away. Google notes that you can press and hold your finger on the top of the device to activate your Google Home instead of speaking the wake word. I'm not sure what the advantage of this is because you still need to speak your request to play an ambient sound theme. If you are going to talk to your Home anyway, you might as well wake it with your voice too. I can already imagine combining these sounds with Hue lighting scenes to create my own voice activated relaxation chamber. Channel your zen to kick off the day. “Ok Google, play me a relaxing sound.” https://t.co/PCbrpataxV #GoogleHome pic.twitter.com/GKjTleg10l — Made by Google (@madebygoogle) May 9, 2017 Source: Google Update 1: 2017/05/06 10:12am PDT While Google's support page says the feature is limited to Google Homes in United States, there are reports of it working outside 'Murica as well.

What is their excuse now? Tiuri Elvander The Home isn't even available outside of the US (and the UK), so it's not like many people will miss out :( Alex Since the Google Home has launched in the UK, every new feature for it (multi user, recipes, etc) has not. The week after it launched, Google changed the shopping list feature to use a service that also hasn't launched in the UK. It also still cannot do any 'skills', meaning that it's basically just a chromecast speaker and a kitchen timer. I'm very glad that SOMEONE at Google cares about Google Home for them to have rolled out a number of updates to it over the past few weeks, but as someone who dropped £130 on it expecting it - from reviews of the American version - to be better than the Amazon Echo, the constant stream of "HERE'S NEW STUFF - BUT NOT FOR YOU" is getting pretty tiresome. NooSH first off all , you should already know that by now so your whining is getting as tiresome as what your'e crying about.. second: maybe blame your own country for that?, pretty sure if every country didn't have international restrictions and laws when it comes to tech, everyone would have everything.. google makes money , that's their job, pretty sure they would want to make as much as possible.. it's like you blaming a clerk for not having a certain item in store. -_- Lars Jeppesen So it is for legal reasons, according to you, that multi user is not available outside the US? Nicholas Conrad I think he just wants to believe in a silver lining to brexit. Lars Jeppesen LOL Alex I've literally never posted on this site about this before ever. You must have an incredibly low threshold for getting tired. I'm also pretty certain there are no laws stopping Google from making some forest noises for the UK, or ensuring that their product can do at a bare minimum what their direct competitor can in the country. What I'm blaming is Google, the developers of the product, from not supporting that product in a country they have released said product in. LondonLeedsFan Absolutely. Release a product, sell it at full price, and provide us with a limited, half-baked and delayed service. Thanks Google! xyz First of all, you should know that no one gives a shit about your feelings. Anyway, nothing funnier than people who are ignorant about everything outside their borders lecturing people on their country's law and regulations. Nicholas Conrad Do you even KNOW how long the us had to wait for crappy 'BBC America' to drop episodes​ of Downton Abbey?? Months! Months after they aired in gb. We live in the internet age, how the crap do you avoid spoilers for *months*? You can't, that's how! Get your shit together and then maybe, just maybe we'll let you have ambient sounds. Alex I'm... sorry? I guess I'll get right onto ITV and ask them why an American company using the BBC's name didn't show a terrible programme sooner? If I do that, will you get Google to stop being shit about supporting their own product? LondonLeedsFan Mate, if you want Downton Abbey, you're more than welcome to it! ;) Lars Jeppesen And we're quite a lot of people who imported the GH - some of us do travel. :) I'm seriously pissed and baffled about why a function like this is only available to the US market.. what's the reason? There must be something.. I don't have multi user either, seriously pissed about it.. why Google, why? Edit: I was prematurely pissed - the relax sounds actually works for me (I'm in Denmark, Europe) Nicholas Conrad Why aren't you NATing it and using a stateside proxy server then? Lars Jeppesen I tried using a VPN bit didn't work.. maybe I need to set it up from scratch again Nicholas Conrad Hmm, is your language setting set to us english? Lars Jeppesen Yes, language is US English, also on my phone LondonLeedsFan We don't even have podcasts on Play Music yet in the UK. Tiuri Elvander For some reason I just got them this weekend. Go to the Play Music website and log out and log in again. Maybe if you have a secondary google account, try that and then return to your main account. I logged in using my dad's account and then when I logged in using my own account again, I got the new look (mid 2016 look) Play Music, including podcasts! Srujan Probably for those panicking over losing healthcare protection on their pre-existing conditions. ericshmerick We get it, you don't like him. Your post is wholly inaccurate by the way.

Lars Jeppesen Hhmm it works for me and I'm in Denmark Zsolt V I don't know but rest assured there is a reason. It's not like some PM says, let's not launch in the UK because they still have a queen. ericshmerick This is awesome since one of my Google Home's is on my bedside table. I just wish there was a way to have separate volume settings for media (this) and alarms. When falling asleep to these ambient sounds, I'll probably have the volume at ~30%. I prefer the alarm volume to be at ~70%. There isn't a way to change it after I've fallen asleep since the 30% setting preserves. One day I guess. jstew182 This is the feature I would like most too come to Home. I wish the voice response could be set to a different level as well rather than default to the same level as everything else. I don't need her yelling at me in the middle of the night if I ask her to change to nest temp or to turn off my fan. WretchedGenius You can do that. In your Google Home app, go to your list of devices. Go into the settings for the device you want to control. Under settings there is a category for Alarms & Timers that lets you set a specific volume that is distinct from the normal device volume. ericshmerick Nice, thanks! Jack Smith Wow! Thanks. Never realized you could do this. Ryan Now they just need to have another one for "her." Since I am often telling it to turn things off from across the living room I like to have her turned up but want music to be quieter 😆😄 https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/732f2199e4eb5e261095d689c87fe28733f8387ee06831dc2198fb9655728479.png TheScientists "I'm not sure what the advantage of this is because you still need to speak your request to play an ambient sound theme." The advantage is that you don't have your phone, tablet, watch, toaster, etc all going off at the same time fighting over who gets to answer the Ok Google request. Paul Quinn The whole point of these home assistants is not having to go physically touch them to use them. I assume that most people have figured out a way to avoid activating multiple devices to use their Home. "Hey Google" is a good way to avoid activating phones and tablets. The multiple activations issue does need to be addressed though. Andrew Palmer Works on my UK Home Lars Jeppesen Ditto for me (Denmark) Willie Chalmers III "The Google Home"? That just sounds odd. Paul Quinn I debated on that. I think I prefer the ominous nature of it. Reminds me of THE Borg. xyz It's appropriate because now Google can listen to everything you say at home. Nick Riviera It works terribly, like quite a few new services. Amit Interesting. No such issues for me. I haven't found home to falter even once, from what I asked for... el conejo Don't worry I'll place a logic bomb called "America Only" and that sh*t will blow up your network trafficking toolkit Paul Quinn We've updated the article because some of you are able to get this to work outside the US. Thanks for that info! Zsolt V How about checking first before spreading FUD? Paul Quinn The Google Home support page said at the time of publication and still at this moment, in red print at the top, "This is only available in the US." I had no reason to doubt such basic information. When we discover possible inaccuracies like this in a post, we act as quickly as possible to update the information. CD RW can't wait to have my nightly ASMR from Google Badouken I've been using this when reading, it makes for a relaxing read. surethom Does not work here in the UK. Unless u have to pay for subscription which I don't. Blake Sinnett They need to add this. https://youtu.be/ZPoqNeR3_UA Paul Quinn Totally! Tell your Home.... Say, "Hey Google, I want to give feedback." Jack Smith Are you not the author? Are you not suppose to know the device? The poster can do this on the GH no problem and should that not be the answer? Jack Smith You can use it and I do similar with others. Just ask your GH to play it. Most nights we listen say at bedtime "hey google play 10 hours of thunderstorms" and it plays it from YouTube. But thanks for sharing because this is what I will use this evening for sure. Hope the wife does not mind. Gregory Strike They did - It's called warp drive sounds. "Ok google, play warp drive sounds" works for me. Jack Smith Love the ambient sounds built-in. But my preference right now is the 10 hours of thunderstorms with flutes from YouTube. Highly recommend. The problem with the others is they do not last long enough. Jack Smith Well re-reading article I am a dork. Never thought to ask for a time period with the built-in white noise. Jack Smith This is not a US only thing you just can play ambient or white noise from YouTube and we do it all the time. Tons more selection and some really good ones. But I really wish the author would know the GH better and share such things. Everytime he writes on the GH drives me nuts as pretty much every time there is incorrect information or something misleading or key points missing and has to be cleaned up in the comments area. Why? Paul Quinn The Google Home support page said at the time of publication and still at this moment, in red print at the top, "This is only available in the US." I had no reason to doubt such basic information. When we discover possible inaccuracies like this in a post, we act as quickly as possible to update the information. The difference here (and the point of the article) was that the GH has this feature built in and includes the ability to set a timer with it. The GH has always been able to play audio tracks of any kind. I guess I could have mentioned this alternate means of playing ambient sound in a sentence. Thanks for the feedback! I am new to this so it all just fine tunes my writing! Cory S If you tell it to play it to a chromecast, they appear to just be existing youtube videos. ED-Zが現れた! My favorite ambient audio is, still, Stickerbrush Symphony. ED-Zが現れた! Humn... Can it change automatically to Song of Storms when it detect sound of rain and thunderstorms? Wim It doesn't work for me when I include "...for 2 hours" Steve Plourde Work very well, here in... Canada! 😇 enkode Anyone know how to make the ambient sound play for longer than an hour or two? The command doesn't seem to work when you request three or more hours of sounds. Also, when requesting more hours, it seems to play audio from Google play music, which is not what I want.

BAUM and DAVID LAZER Los Angeles Times We know a lot about fake news. Academics have been studying it – and how to combat it – for decades. In 1925, Harper’s Magazine published “Fake News and the Public,” calling its spread via new communication technologies “a source of unprecedented danger.” That danger has only increased, of course. Some of the most shared “news stories” from the 2016 U.S. election – such as Hillary Clinton selling weapons to Islamic State or the pope endorsing Donald Trump for president – were simply made up. Unfortunately – as a conference we recently convened at Harvard revealed – the solutions Google, Facebook and other tech giants and media companies are pursuing aren’t in many instances the ones that social scientists and computer scientists are convinced will work. Familiarity We know, for example, that the more you’re exposed to things that aren’t true, the more likely you are to eventually accept them. As recent studies led by psychologist Gordon Pennycook, political scientist Adam Berinsky and others have shown, over time people tend to forget where or how they found out about a news story. When they encounter it again, it is familiar from the prior exposure, and so they are more likely to accept it as true. It doesn’t matter if from the start it was labeled as fake news or unreliable – repetition is what counts. Reducing acceptance of fake news thus means making it less familiar. Editors, producers, distributors and aggregators need to stop repeating these stories, especially in their headlines. A fact-check story about “birtherism,” for example, should lead by debunking the myth, not restating it. This flies in the face of a lot of traditional journalistic practice. The online Washington Post regularly features “Fact Checker” headlines consisting of claims to be evaluated, with a “Pinocchio Test” appearing at the end of the accompanying story. The problem is that readers are more likely to notice and remember the claim than the conclusion. Another thing we know is that shocking claims stick in your memory. A long-standing body of research shows that people are more likely to attend to and later recall a sensational or negative headline, even if a fact checker flags it as suspect. Fake news stories nearly always feature alarming claims designed to grab the attention of web surfers. Fact checkers can’t compete – especially if their findings are writ small. Messenger To persuade people that fake news is fake, the messenger is as important as the message. When it comes to correcting falsehoods, a fellow partisan is often more persuasive than a neutral third party. For instance, Trump is arguably the individual most closely associated with birtherism. But in September 2016, Trump announced that Obama was a native-born American, “period.” Polling a few days later showed an 18-percentage point drop among registered Republicans in acceptance of the birther myth. Countless debunking stories by fact checkers had far less impact. The internet platforms have perhaps the most important role in the fight against fake news. They need to move suspect news stories farther down the lists of items returned through search engines or social media feeds. The key to evaluating credibility, and story placement, is to focus not on individual items but on the cumulative stream of content from a given website. Evaluating individual stories is simply too slow to reliably stem their spread. Google recently announced some promising steps in this direction. It was responding to criticism that its search algorithm had elevated to front-page status some stories featuring Holocaust denial and false information about the 2016 election. But more remains to be done. Holocaust denial is, after all, low-hanging fruit, relatively easily flagged. Yet even here Google’s initial efforts produced at best mixed results, initially shifting a denial site downward, then ceasing to work reliably before ultimately eliminating the site from search results. The platforms must also wrestle more seriously with how to evade manipulation. Recent research led by computer scientist Filippo Menczer highlights the synchronized push of fake news by millions of bots on social media and has developed new ways of detecting them. In a white paper released last month, Facebook claims that its top priority is making sure accounts are owned by real people. Yet its visible efforts to date to purge fake accounts – most notably 30,000 in France ahead of that nation’s presidential election – seem small relative to the scale of the problem. By its own estimates, Facebook may have as many 138 million duplicate or false accounts. Accountability Finally, the public must hold Facebook, Google and other platforms to account. It is difficult to assess how real or effective their anti-fake news efforts are because they control the data necessary for such evaluations. Independent researchers must have access to the data in a way that protects user privacy but helps us figure out what is and isn’t working in the fight against misinformation. For all the talk about fake news, the truth is that we know a lot about why people read, believe and share things that aren’t true. Now we just need the big technology platforms and media companies to take the truth to heart. Matthew A.

It changed our understanding of human history. Updated by Brian Resnick@B_resnick May 17, 2017, 12:00am EDT tweet share A picture taken at the Archaeological Museum in Athens on September 14, 2014 shows a piece of the Antikythera Mechanism. LOUISA GOULIAMAKI/AFP/Getty Image Exactly 115 years ago today, divers looking for sponges discovered the wreck of a 2,000-year-old vessel off the Greek island Antikythera. Scattered among the wreck’s treasures — beautiful vases and pots, jewelry, a bronze statue of an ancient philosopher — was the most peculiar thing: a series of brass gears and dials mounted in a case the size of a mantel clock. Archeologists dubbed the instrument the Antikythera mechanism. The genius — and mystery — of this piece of ancient Greek technology, arguably the world’s first computer, is why Google is highlighting it today in a Google Doodle. What is the Antikythera mechanism? At first glance, the piece of brass found near the wreck looks like something you might find in a junkyard or hanging on the wall of a maritime-themed dive bar. What remains of the mechanism is a set of rusted brass gears sandwiched into a rotting wooden box. The front side of the Antikythera mechanism. Wikimedia Commons The backside. Wikimedia Commons But if you look into the machine, you see evidence of at least two dozen gears, laid neatly on top of one another, calibrated with the precision of a master-crafted Swiss watch. This was a level of technology that archeologists would usually date to the 16th century, not well before the first. But a mystery remained: What was this contraption used for? The world’s first mechanical computer? To archeologists, it was immediately apparent that the mechanism was some sort of clock, calendar, or calculating device. But they had no idea what it was for. For decades, they debated: Was the Antikythera a toy model of the planets? Or perhaps it was an early astrolabe (a device to calculate latitude)? In 1959, Princeton science historian Derek J. de Solla Price provided the most thorough scientific analysis of the contraption to date. After a careful study of the gears, he deduced that the mechanism was used to predict the position of the planets and stars in the sky depending on the calendar month. A main gear would move to represent the calendar year, and would, in turn, move many separate smaller gears to represent the motions of the planets, sun, and moon. So you could set the main gear to the calendar date and get approximations for where those celestial objects would be in the sky on that date. And Price declared in the pages of Scientific American that it was a computer: “The mechanism is like a great astronomical clock ... or like a modern analogue computer which uses mechanical parts to save tedious calculation.” It was a computer in the sense that you, as a user, could input a few simple variables and it would yield a flurry of complicated mathematical calculations. Today the programming of computers is written in digital code — series of ones and zeros. This ancient clock had its code written into the mathematical ratios of its gears. All the user had to do was enter the main date on one gear, and through a series of subsequent gear turns, the mechanism could calculate things like the angle of the sun crossing the sky. (For some reference, mechanical calculators — which used gear ratios to add and subtract — didn’t arrive in Europe until the 1600s.) Scientists have learned even more about how the Antikythera mechanism works A modern reconstruction of the mechanism. LOUISA GOULIAMAKI/AFP/Getty Images Since Price’s assessment, modern X-ray and 3D mapping technology have allowed scientists to peer deeper into the remains of the mechanism and learn even more of its secrets. In the 2000s, researchers revealed text — a kind of instruction manual — inscribed on parts of the mechanism that had never been seen before. The text — written in tiny typeface but legible ancient Greek — helped them complete the puzzle of what the machine did and how it was operated. In all, it’s astounding. The mechanism had several dials and clock faces, each which served a different function for measuring movements of the sun, moon, stars, and planets, but they were all operated by one main crank: Little stone or glass orbs that would have moved across the machine’s face to show the motion of Mercury, Venus, Mars, Saturn, and Jupiter in the night sky The position of the sun and moon, relative to the 12 constellations of the zodiac Another dial forecasting solar and lunar eclipses — and, oddly, predictions about their color. (Researchers guess that different colored eclipses were considered omens of the future. The ancient Greeks were a little superstitious.) A solar calendar, charting the 365 days of the year A lunar calendar, counting a 19-year lunar cycle A tiny pearl-size ball that rotated to show you the phase of the moon And this is pretty neat: another dial of the mechanism that counted down the days to regularly scheduled sporting events around the Greek isles, like the Olympics Again, the mechanics of this are absurdly complicated. A 2006 Nature paper plotted out a schematic of the mechanics that connect all the gears. It looks like this. Not simple. Researchers are still not sure who, exactly, used it. Did scientists build it to aid their calculations? Or was it a type of a teaching tool, to show students the math that held the cosmos together? Was it unique? Or are there more similar devices yet to be discovered? Its assembly remains another mystery. How the ancient Greeks accomplished this feat is unknown to this day. Whatever it was used for and however it was built, we know this: Its discovery changed our understanding of human history, and reminds us that flashes of genius are possible in every human age. "Nothing like this instrument is preserved elsewhere. Nothing comparable to it is known from any ancient scientific text or literary allusion,” Price wrote in 1959. “It is a bit frightening, to know that just before the fall of their great civilization the ancient Greeks had come so close to our age, not only in their thought, but also in their scientific technology.” Check out a modern reconstruction of the mechanism in the video below.

Greg Hywood: Speaking at today’s Senate Select Committee on the Future of Public Interest Journalism in Sydney, Hywood said the media industry needs a level playing field in order to compete. The inquiry, led by Sam Dastyari, was announced last week following a week-long Fairfax journalist strike over mass redundancies. “Current media regulations designed for a legacy market prevent local media effectively competing for scale with international players such as Facebook and Google,” Hywood argued. “ABC is creating additional pressure on commercial media by aggressively competing for the same audience that commercial media rely on by providing online content for free undermining our ability to create a sustainable model. “The ABC also pays Google out of taxpayers money, who pay negligible tax, and spend nothing on local content provision for search engine marketing, that means that the ABC stories appear higher on search terms such as national news, international news and restricts our ability to generate revenue from our audience.” Hywood argued the “biggest threat” to quality journalism is “unprofitable media companies”. “We believe the biggest threat to quality journalism in this country is unprofitable local media companies,” he said. Hywood argued ABC is taking traffic away from the commercial media companies. “They use dollars to drive their traffic and they take traffic away from us, traffic is dollars to us and if ABC takes traffic from us by using tax payers money to drive that traffic it’s using tax payers money to disadvantage commercial media organisations,” he said. “You do not have to pay money to Google to drive traffic, you can put your content up and people can search that content and see where it lands. “If the ABC happens to be down the bottom, they’ve still fulfilled their mandate to get the news out to Australian people, people can go straight onto the ABC websites. “But what we do as commercial organisations is compete for traffic because traffic is dollars,” Hywood continued. “To me, the issue is if we want the sort of diversity that everyone wants in terms of as many players as possible in this local marketplace, the commercial organisations need to be as healthy as possible and why the ABC is taking money out of the system I don’t understand. “The ABC does claim it does not spend much money but it does spend money. “What we’re talking is government funding to do this, I am not saying doing this with the ABC is going to solve the problem, it’s a bigger problem than that but it doesn’t help,” he said. Hywood rejected the notion Fairfax is “anti-ABC”. “The ABC is part of the Australian community and has been for many years and does very good work,” he said. “It’s just aspects of the new world of media where we have to be careful the decisions of government don’t impinge upon the diversity and the commercial environment we all value.” During the inquiry, Hywood also rejected the suggestion that he has received bonuses on slashing editorial jobs. “Given the recent press I’m not surprised the question has been asked,” he said when the question of his remuneration was raised. “Everyone at Fairfax is paid appropriately in terms of market rates. The CEO salary at Fairfax is based around benchmarking around companies of similar size both in terms of market capitalisation, revenues, employees. “That salary is round where the market is for that role and what we pride ourselves on at Fairfax is to provide market rate or better salaries for everyone throughout the organisation.  “Bonus arrangements for executives, not just CEO’s, is very common practice across publicly-listed companies, both short and long term,” Hywood said. “Let me say in terms of short and long term – the long term incentives that have been received by Fairfax executives have been based around the substantial growth in the Domain business which has driven the share price. “Short term incentives, which have been based upon yearly earnings, which have been stressed because of the publishing business’, have been much less and have not been achieved.” Hywood added that he has not received a short term bonus for some years “because of the stress on earnings of the publishing business”. When pushed on if he is incentivised to cut jobs, he said: “They are based around the performance of earnings for the company on an annual basis, largely. There is no single incentive based around laying off journalists. “Salaries of people in Fairfax will not solve what is a global issue around the disruption going on in the media, that is what is occurring. This is a global phenomenon. People inside Fairfax should be paid appropriate market rates for what they do and they are but what we have to do is deal with these global issues.” The bulk of Hywood’s hour-long interview with the inquiry largely focused on his own and other executives remuneration, with Hywood stating he has a base of $1.6m which he admitted is a “very healthy income”. “Everything around my personal salary is in the annual report and is open for scrutiny through the Fairfax annual report,” he said. When pushed again on his remuneration, Hywood shot back at the Senators, stating: “I thought we were here to talk about the future of journalism.” When asked what was he paid last year, he refused to answer, stating “I don’t think that is appropriate”. Hywood was also questioned on the TPG offer currently before the Fairfax Media Board. “This is a really difficult issue – this is something I cannot talk about, it is in front of the board a the moment,” he said when asked if TPG has access to Fairfax’s books at the moment. “I really don’t want to comment on that, I feel very uncomfortable commenting on that.” The inquiry noted it would consider calling upon TPG to appear at the next session. When asked on media reform and how that might impact offers before the Fairfax Media board, Hywood returned to his Facebook-Google comments. “If the laws changed, the media companies in this country can have conversations about the right mix of assets for media companies and whether that leads to some sort of consolidation of those assets I don’t know, but right now we can’t have that conversation,” he said. “And while we can’t have that conversation, Google and Facebook continue to hoover up dollars because they have scale. “When a board looks at a takeover offer, by law it has to look after shareholder interests. Therefore it looks at the value of the business and at the offer and it makes it decision on the outcome for the shareholders,” he added. Earlier in the day the committee heard from Paul Murphy, CEO of the Media, Entertainment and Arts Alliance, who warned that the government needed to look at tax relief and tax incentives in a bid to help protect the future of journalism. MEAA CEO Paul Murphy “We do have to look at tax deductibility for new subscriptions and some sort of industry assistance,” Murphy said. Murphy also raised concerns about the potential impact of splitting Fairfax’s newspaper business from Domain. The union leader also revealed to full cost of Fairfax’s redundancy program over the last decade, saying the media company had paid out $455.5m in redundancy payments between 2007 and 2016. Questioned on the impact of media newsroom closures in regional Australia he said that regional Australians had lost a vital resource for local news, with remaining journalists under extreme pressure to deliver content such as photos and stories with increasing stretched resources. “It’s kind of like journalists are operating in a Thermomix environment where you drop ingredients in and come out with a complex product,” he said. Murphy also said that the digital giants, Google and Facebook, which had soaked up a lot of the revenue lost from newspapers in recent years, should be forced to pay a 1% advertising levy which could be used to support local journalism. One Senator likened the power of Google to that of the Dutch East India Company in the 1800s. Murphy said a successful bid by TPG for Fairfax, which could see the closure of the mastheads, would be bad news for News Limited as well, with the loss of competitive tension in the market leading to a cascading effect where there was no pressure from competitors to find stories. Investigative journalist Michael West, who set up his own website after being sacked from Fairfax last year, raised a number of serious issues, including Australia’s defamation laws which precluded small individual and small independent news site from taking on the might of corporate Australia. He said while he had built up the expertise in taking on big business developed over more than 20 years with Fairfax and News Corp, journalism that challenged the practices of big business could not continue without proper funding. West warned that journalists, fearing the reaction of big business, were already self censoring their work in order to avoid the possibility of defamation or other legal proceedings used by well funded businesses to shut down stories. “The costs are prohibitive for someone without a big budget,” he said. He said his own new reporting platform, michaelwest.com.au, relied on people “digging in and donating” to support his investigative journalism.

Previously, it did not, and was billed to a SGD account offshore. Now, irrespective of what currency I pay in, GST reconciliation is taking place. I think Mr Hywood comments regarding tax exposure may be based on out of date information. As to the degree to which a hypothetical Hilmerization cost has to be understood, I think Mr Hywood needs to be careful what he asks for. I suspect that the cost of compliance to levelize the field would not lead naturally to any net advantage to commercials, because I think the search engine outcomes are NOT directed to [ad] outcomes, but are natural google preference for news sources which are not paywalled: in short, whatever the ABC is paying for, it cannot augment the order of non paid ranking and overwhelmingly thats what people actually click on. I see ABC hits high in [paid] box like everyone else. They’re often the same hits as the non-paid ranked search return. I think if Mr Hywood thinks he can cobble together a business case by stealing 10c per day of everyone, he has another think coming. He’s not in radio, or TV. The more he trys to justify his news role against a general public broadcaster, the worse it goes for him because the one thing he can’t do, is deliver the entire package the ABC and SBS can. Reply minnie 17 May 17 This old Chestnut. Does anyone — Fairfax and News included — seriously think their businesses would be in top top shape, and not going down the gurgler if only the ABC weren’t there? Patent nonsense.

Although I/O has always been a conference where Google reaches out to developers, and hence mostly makes announcements related to its software platforms, this time the company is expected to announce new virtual reality (VR) hardware. At the same time, Google is also expected to talk about the Android O, which was announced earlier, in more detail at the conference. Although no specific details are available about the new VR hardware from Google, there are rumours that this would be similar to Facebook Oculus and HTC Vive. In other words, unlike Google's own VR headset - called Daydream - that was announced earlier, this one will be a standalone headset and will not require a smartphone to function. Instead, the headset is expected to come with all required hardware already inside it. As it happens with Google products, the new VR hardware will come with a few special Google bits. The company is expected to make use its formidable knowledge in AI and machine learning to equip the VR hardware with features that will make it unique when compared to the existing VR headsets like the ones from Oculus and HTC. Android O featuresApart from the VR related announcements, Google CEO Sundar Pichai who will kick off the keynote, is also expected to provide more details on the Android O, which will be the version of Android that follows Android Nougat. Android O was announced earlier but tonight Google may talk about its user-related features and may announce a date for the beta testing of this new mobile operating system.

It is expected that company may talk about how with the machine learning, it is solving some of the thorny problems like translation and voice recognition in a better way. It is also expected to detail the progress it has made as far as the Google Assistant is concerned. Google Assistant, which is an AI built into Android phones and products like Google Home, helps Google compete with Apple's Siri and Microsoft's Cortana. It was announced last year and then later shipped to consumers with the Android Nougat. Although this doesn't sound much in terms of consumer technology, there is more that is expected at Google I/O 2017. But overall, there is a reason why the I/O is a conference primarily for developers. Most of time Google here talks about the tools and services that are relevant to developers. The big announcements, especially hardware and phone related, are rare. They are reserved for the Google phone launches that happen before winter. This year too I/O is going to be the same. The next-generation Pixel phones will not be announced at I/O. Chances are that other than VR hardware, Google may not announce anything else on the hardware side. But whatever Google announces or not announces, we will update you with the India Today Tech I/O live blog later in the night. Stay tuned.

Anyone watching would have witnessed an odd sight: Eustace was wearing a bulky white space suit—the kind nasa astronauts wear. He looked like a free-falling Michelin Man. Listen to the audio version of this article:Download the Audm app for your iPhone to listen to more titles. Through his giant space helmet and oxygen mask, Eustace could see the ground stretched out for miles. But the view wasn’t his main concern. He hadn’t quite worked out how to control the space suit, which, unlike a typical skydiving suit, weighed about 265 pounds and was pumped full of pressurized air. Eustace, an experienced skydiver, knew how to shift his body to change direction or to stop himself from spinning—a problem that, if uncorrected, can lead to blackout, then death. But when he started to rotate—slowly at first, then faster and faster—his attempts to steady himself just made things worse. He felt like he was bouncing around inside a concrete box. At 10,000 feet, Eustace pulled a cord to open his parachute. Nothing happened. Then he tried a backup cord. That one didn’t work either. Eustace knew better than to panic: Three safety divers had jumped with him to monitor his fall. Within seconds, one of the divers reached across Eustace and yanked open the main chute. All Eustace had to do now was depressurize his suit, which would deflate it and allow him to steer himself toward the landing area. He reached for a dial on the side of the suit and turned it. Nothing happened. With the suit still pressurized, Eustace couldn’t extend his arms overhead to grab the handles that controlled the chute. He began slowly drifting off course. Soon he lost sight of the safety divers. He tried to radio for help, but got no response. He now had a more pressing problem: As he approached the ground, he saw that he was headed straight for a giant saguaro cactus. Unable to maneuver his chute, he leaned as far to the right as he could and just managed to avoid the cactus, instead landing headfirst in the sand. Eustace’s jump from 18,000 feet above Coolidge, Arizona, in May 2013—his first test of the space suit in action (Daniel Blignaut) He craned his neck to look around. The suit was still pressurized, which meant that he didn’t have enough flexibility to take his helmet off to breathe. He tried his radio again. Still dead. He knew the safety divers would have alerted rescuers that he’d gone off course. He just didn’t know how far off course he’d gone. He calculated that he had two hours of oxygen left in his tank. If he sat still and didn’t panic, he should have enough to survive until the rescue team found him. His other option was to try depressurizing the suit again. But if that didn’t work, he’d have wasted a significant amount of oxygen in the effort. He decided to wait until he had just 15 minutes of oxygen left. By that point, he would be desperate enough to try anything. The sun beat down as Eustace lay by the cactus, watching the meter on his oxygen tank. Twelve minutes and what felt like an eternity later, he heard the sound of an approaching helicopter. Oh good, he thought, relaxing. I’m nowhere near dead. Which was fortunate, because this was only a practice round. What Eustace was gearing up for was something much more dangerous: a jump from seven and a half times the altitude, the highest ever attempted. A skydive from the edge of space. Alan Eustace at home in Mountain View, April 2017 (Ian Allen) The whole thing began innocently enough. Eustace was sitting in his office at Google’s headquarters in Mountain View, California, one day in late 2008 when his boss Sergey Brin dropped by. Brin knew Eustace had skydived recreationally in the past, and wanted to know whether he thought it would be possible for someone to jump out of a Gulfstream, a large, expensive private jet that Brin sometimes used. Brin had already asked around, but almost everyone he’d consulted—Gulfstream pilots, military skydivers, even the company that makes the jet—had advised against it. Gulfstreams fly at much higher speeds than typical jump planes, so fast that experts worried anyone exiting midair would risk getting sucked into the engine, or hitting the tail of the plane, or getting burned to death by the exhaust. Eustace wasn’t a jet pilot, or a professional daredevil. He was an engineer from Florida who had designed computer-processing units for 15 years in Palo Alto before Larry Page persuaded him to join his growing company over breakfast one morning in 2002. Eustace hadn’t been skydiving in 26 years, but the idea intrigued him: He wasn’t convinced that the skeptics were right. As an engineer, he preferred to approach a problem from first principles. If it was impossible, why? What was the trajectory of the exhaust? Would the FAA grant approval to open the door mid-flight, which would require circumventing the user manual? Eustace spent the next few months trying to answer these questions, in between projects that demanded his more immediate attention. He eventually lined up a skydiver to try a jump out of a Cessna Caravan, another high-speed aircraft. Luckily, the skydiver landed without incident. What’s more, he filmed himself. When Eustace brought Brin the footage, Brin seemed surprised that he had followed up. But by this point, Eustace was hooked—and he was starting to consider trying the jump himself. All he’d have to do was get reacquainted with the equipment and do a couple of test jumps. In August 2010, Eustace took a few days off and went down to the suburbs of Los Angeles, where he did six practice jumps with an instructor, a professional stunt skydiver named Luigi Cani. The two hit it off—Cani was warm and friendly, and seemed up for anything. He loved the Gulfstream idea. From Our June 2017 Issue Try 2 FREE issues of The Atlantic Subscribe A few months later, Eustace was back home in Mountain View when his phone rang. It was Cani. He wanted to know whether Eustace had heard about a guy named Felix Baumgartner, who was after an even bigger challenge: He was trying to beat the high-altitude-skydiving record with a jump from the upper reaches of the stratosphere, more than 100,000 feet in the air. Cani had found a sponsor to launch a competing effort, and wondered whether Eustace could advise him on the type of equipment he’d need. Eustace was delighted. He was sure Baumgartner was way ahead—he had backing from the energy-drink company Red Bull, which had hired more than three dozen team members with backgrounds in nasa, the Air Force, and the aerospace industry—but he liked Cani, and wanted to see him create some healthy competition. He agreed to help in any way he could. But before Cani’s effort could kick off, his funding fell through. Eustace considered this news. He led a quiet, comfortable life. He wasn’t after publicity or adrenaline. But this was the engineering challenge of a lifetime. Forget the Gulfstream. He could attempt the stratosphere jump himself, and fund it with his own savings. He thought for a few months and called Cani to ask for his blessing. Cani laughed, amused. Go for it, he said. The atmosphere is divided into five layers. The higher you go, the thinner the air, until eventually you hit outer space. The layer closest to Earth, the troposphere, is where weather occurs. The next layer, between 33,000 and 160,000 feet above sea level, is the stratosphere. It marks the beginning of what’s known as “near space”—the threshold between the planet we experience on the ground and the mysteries of the universe beyond. Prior to the onset of the space race in the late 1950s, much of the scientific study into high altitudes was focused on the stratosphere. Starting in the 1930s, scientists used high-altitude balloons to gather meteorological data and document various changes in the upper atmosphere. Then, in 1960, a United States Air Force captain named Joseph Kittinger rose 102,800 feet in a gondola suspended from a helium balloon—and jumped. Kittinger was part of Project Excelsior, a pre-space-age military operation designed to study the effects of high-altitude bailouts. An earlier attempt, from 76,400 feet, had almost killed him: His equipment had malfunctioned and he’d lost consciousness; he was saved only by his automatic emergency parachute. His next jump, from 74,700 feet, had gone better. This one—his third—set a high-altitude-skydiving record that would remain in place for more than 50 years. nasa would soon send a man into orbit, and ambitions would turn to the moon. The expansion of the space program coincided with a series of catastrophic balloon accidents, and exploration into the stratosphere was largely abandoned. That is, until 2010, when Baumgartner announced that he was going after Kittinger’s record, with the backing of none other than Kittinger himself—plus a hefty sponsorship from Red Bull. Plenty of people had contacted Kittinger over the years, wanting him to help them break the record, but Baumgartner was the first to come with a sound scientific support system, courtesy of Red Bull’s team of professionals. The effort, amplified by Baumgartner’s high-octane personal life, attracted a lot of press. Eustace was an unlikely competitor. The son of an aerospace engineer for Martin Marietta (a forerunner of Lockheed Martin), Eustace had grown up loving planes, but his first time jumping out of one—18 years old, dragged along by his best friend—he felt less exhilaration than ambivalence. The equipment was primitive—coveralls, thick boots, military-grade parachutes—and Eustace landed hard. The experience was a blur. He didn’t know whether he’d done it right, and he certainly didn’t plan to do it again. Then the instructor handed him his evaluation. His friend’s jump was terrible, but the instructor had deemed Eustace’s “perfect.” So when his friend wanted to go back a week later, Eustace went along. He enjoyed it much more the second time: He was less nervous, and could actually remember what he had done. He went again, and again, and after his 10th jump, he invested in a higher-performance parachute. Then he mastered a stand-up landing, instead of a drop-and-roll. He learned to dive, swoop, somersault, slow down, and speed up, until skydiving became less like falling than like flying. Eustace (center) skydiving with friends in 1981, while getting his doctorate in computer science at the University of Central Florida. (Tom Plonka) Eustace began skydiving as often as he could manage between classes at the University of Central Florida, where he majored in computer science and went on to get his doctorate. But as his career took off, Eustace invested less and less time in the sport. Eventually, he sold his equipment. Skydiving from the stratosphere seemed like a drastic way to get back into practice. But the more he thought about it, the harder it was for him to imagine someone else doing it. His day job—overseeing Google’s engineers—was all about building technology to solve problems and move people forward. Breaking the record would be a personal challenge, but more important, it would be a chance to push the boundaries of human experience. First, he’d need a suit. The list of things that can go wrong when parachuting from extreme heights is nearly endless. The stratosphere is cold, for one—the temperature can reach more than 100 degrees below zero. The air is also about 1,000 times thinner than at sea level, which means that without a pressurized suit, bodily fluids start to boil, creating gas bubbles that lead to mass swelling. The environment is so hostile that high-altitude jumpers have to bring their own. For his record-breaking jump, Kittinger wore a partial-pressure suit—a close-fitting garment with a network of thin inflatable tubes that squeeze the body to make up for the decrease in atmospheric pressure—on top of four layers of clothing for warmth. On the way up, which took about an hour and a half, he rode in an open gondola that contained an oxygen supply, a communications system, altimeters, and the power source for his electrically heated gloves—everything he needed to survive prolonged exposure to the altitude. But gondolas present their own risks. In 1962, a Soviet air-force colonel named Pyotr Dolgov hit his head on the side of his gondola when he jumped from almost 94,000 feet, cracking the visor of his helmet and accidentally depressurizing his suit. He died before he hit the ground. A few years later, an amateur skydiver from New Jersey named Nick Piantanida was unable to switch from the oxygen supply in the gondola to the one attached to his suit when he reached his intended jump height of 123,500 feet, and had to abort the trip. (An unknown equipment malfunction on his next attempt would be fatal.) Gondolas are also heavy. Baumgartner’s team was using one that weighed almost 3,000 pounds. Ditching the gondola not only would be safer, Eustace figured, but would also allow him to start his jump from a greater height. But nobody had ever attempted a stratosphere jump without one. If Eustace was going to rise 26 miles into the air attached to nothing but a helium balloon, he’d need a suit that would provide the same environmental protections—oxygen, instruments, climate control—that a gondola would. In short, he would need a space suit. The problem was that no one had designed or flown a new space suit in about 40 years. nasa has been using essentially the same version of the Apollo suit since the 1970s—and Eustace couldn’t just borrow one of those. He needed a suit that could survive a slow ascent into the stratosphere and a fast descent, with swift changes in temperature and velocity, and that could also support the weight of a giant parachute. 1 | Balloon equipment module: Connects the balloon to the jumper. The module fires a small explosive to detach the jumper for descent. 2 | Instrument panel: Displays oxygen-tank levels, suit pressure, and altitude. 3 | Depressurization valve: The jumper pulls the safety loop and turns the valve to depressurize the suit, making it easier to steer in preparation for landing. 4 | Parachute handles: Attached to cords that open the main and reserve parachutes. 5 | Equipment-­module chest pack: Contains two oxygen tanks, radios, monitoring devices, and a thermal unit to heat the water that circulates through the suit to keep the jumper warm. 6 | Mountaineering boots: Designed for expeditions on Mount Everest, climbing boots worn under the space suit protect from the extreme cold and can bear a load of more than 400 pounds on landing. Eustace began to dedicate his nights and weekends to thinking about the design. He was still working 80-hour weeks at Google, but he had a lot of vacation time saved up, and his bosses—Brin and Page—were encouraging. A saying inside the company was that employees should have “a healthy disrespect for the impossible.” Eustace’s wife, Kathy Kwan, was less enthusiastic. The couple had two daughters, 11 and 16, and she knew the history of the sport. Eustace was so engrossed in the technological challenges that the possibility of death didn’t really enter his mind—any risk, he thought, could be mitigated by enough advance preparation. The couple made an uneasy truce: Kwan would support Eustace’s project, and he would avoid bringing it up—no stratosphere talk at the dinner table. (Kwan politely declined to speak with me, saying she preferred not to dredge up those particular memories.) In October 2011, a contact in the aviation industry connected Eustace with a married couple named Taber MacCallum and Jane Poynter, co-founders of Paragon Space Development. MacCallum and Poynter had been two of the eight crew members on the famous Biosphere 2 project of the early ’90s, living in a sealed artificial world for two years to determine whether humans could survive in closed ecosystems beyond Earth. They had started Paragon to create biological and chemical life-support systems for hazardous environments, like the deep sea and outer space. The couple was used to getting calls from people asking all kinds of crazy things: Can you fly me into space? Would it be possible to strap me to a rocket? But this was the first time they’d heard anyone propose a stratosphere jump without a capsule. MacCallum was intrigued enough to set up a call with Eustace, and the two spoke for more than an hour. A week later, Eustace flew down to Paragon’s headquarters, in Tucson, Arizona, and spent a day presenting his idea. The test dummy spun wildly on her way down. One time, her arms and legs flew off. MacCallum and Poynter soon agreed to lead Eustace’s engineering team. They gathered the company’s leading engineers, mechanics, and flight operators to work on the design, and commissioned ILC Dover—the same manufacturing company that makes nasa’s suits—to build a prototype. Eustace soon began making regular trips to Tucson for testing. The team put the suit in a wind tunnel and a vacuum chamber to determine how it would hold up in free fall. They hung Eustace from a nylon strap and spun him around so he could practice operating his equipment in midair. Next came a series of thermal tests, to ensure the suit could handle subzero temperatures. Eustace was suspended inside a sealed, liquid-nitrogen-cooled chamber for five hours at a time. Small tubes in the suit were supposed to circulate hot water around his limbs and chest to keep him warm. But the tubes ended at the wrists, meaning that, even with a pair of electrically heated mountain-climbing gloves, Eustace’s hands eventually began to freeze. The team gave him a pair of oven mitts to wear on top of the gloves. A member of Paragon’s engineering team testing how the suit would respond to changes in air pressure (Volker Kern) In October 2012, a year into Eustace’s work with Paragon, Felix Baumgartner succeeded in breaking Kittinger’s 1960 record, free-falling to Earth from a height of 127,852 feet. Reporters from all over the world came to witness the event, and a live webcast of the jump racked up more than 8 million views. Rather than deter Eustace, Baumgartner’s jump gave him a test case. Shortly after exiting the capsule, Baumgartner entered a dangerous spin. He was able to right himself in time, but Eustace would be less agile in his suit and knew that he would need to figure out how to avoid the same problem. Eustace and his team began doing dummy drops from airplanes in the Arizona desert. The test dummy, known as ida (for “Iron Dummy Assemble”), was made from welded high-pressure pipes, the kind used in industrial plumbing. She was dropped from various heights, equipped with a parachute that opened at a preset altitude. She spun wildly on her way down. One time, her arms and legs flew off. The team tried to fix the problem by introducing a drogue—a round parachute about six feet across that is supposed to add stability. The Coolidge jump, in May 2013, was Eustace’s first chance to test the equipment himself. While nearly everything went wrong, the biggest problem remained spin. Eustace began spinning almost immediately after he left the plane, even with the drogue, and the suit was too rigid to allow him to correct himself midair the way he would during a skydive from a lower altitude. After the Coolidge jump, the team decided to raise the attachment point of the drogue, moving it from the seat of the suit to the back of the neck. That would make Eustace fall at a slight angle, and therefore not spin. To keep his arms from getting tangled up in the strings when the chute deployed, the engineers added a boom that would extend when the drogue opened and keep it at a safe distance from the suit. They called the system saeber. When the team tested the system on ida from 120,000 feet, her spinning slowed from 400 rpm to 22 rpm, a gentle pirouette. Eustace did more practice jumps, learning to stick out his elbows to correct himself in midair. They were finally ready. Eustace woke up well before dawn on Friday, October 24, 2014, in a tin shed on an unused strip of land next to the airport in Roswell, New Mexico—a site that had been chosen for its open space and relatively few cacti. The weather was perfect. He spent two hours sitting in a vinyl recliner behind the shed breathing pure oxygen, to prevent decompression sickness. He drank water and Gatorade. Occasionally he stood and did some stretches to get nitrogen out of his tissues. Then he pulled on a diaper—it would be a long ride up—and was helped into his suit by four team members. They attached two GoPros to his chest and wheeled him out to the launchpad on a dolly. As Eustace drifted higher, whole states appeared and receded. He turned his head to look for the moon. Kwan had chosen to stay home. The girls had school that day—Eustace and Kwan had decided to keep them on their normal schedule—but had been granted permission to bring their phones to class so they could get updates from the launch site. The Paragon team and a single reporter from The New York Times would be the only onlookers. The team strapped Eustace to a massive helium balloon—525 feet in diameter when fully inflated, roughly the size of a football stadium—and untethered it from the launchpad. Just like that, Eustace was on his way. He felt relaxed, almost drowsy, as the balloon rose above the airport. He worried for a moment that he might fall asleep and miss the jump. Left: Inflating the helium balloon that would carry Eustace to the stratosphere. Right: Eustace starting his ascent. (J. Martin Harris Photography) As Eustace drifted higher, he began to make out landmarks: New Mexico’s White Sands, the Rocky Mountains. Crop circles became tiny specks. Whole states appeared and receded. At 70,000 feet, the sky darkened. Delicate cloud formations appeared below him. Eustace felt like he was floating above a lace doily. At 80,000 feet, the curvature of Earth became visible. He turned his head to look for the moon. Of course, he was also comparing his flight path to the projections, keeping an eye on the time and the stratospheric winds that were expected to kick in and push him east, and doing a mental rehearsal of the emergency procedures. At one point, Eustace stopped climbing fast enough, so ground control radioed him to let him know that it was releasing two 30-pound ballast weights. Each ballast had its own parachute, and he watched with interest as they fell back to Earth. The stratosphere was quiet as Eustace began free-falling, but soon he could hear the rush of air inside his helmet. After two hours and seven minutes, Eustace reached 135,890 feet. This was float altitude: The balloon had expanded as far as it could, so he would not rise farther. Ground control would now detach him by remote control. The countdown began. On “zero,” Eustace felt the balloon snap and drift off. For a single moment, he felt like he was hovering in midair. He did a backflip. Then he did another. Then saeber kicked in, launching the drogue and pushing Eustace into a downward position, facing Earth. The stratosphere was quiet as Eustace began free-falling, but soon he could hear the rush of air inside his helmet. He passed 822 miles an hour, breaking the speed of sound. At about 8,300 feet above the ground—after four minutes and 27 seconds of free fall—Eustace deployed his main parachute. Nine and a half minutes later, he landed with a smile on his face. His team rushed over, barely able to contain the whoops and yeahs. The record was his. The Times reporter’s story would not run until later that day, and Eustace’s reception was decidedly more muted than Baumgartner’s. After he was freed from the suit, he helped clean up the landing site, check the GoPro footage, and wrap up the parachute. That night, the whole team went to a Mexican restaurant in Roswell. Eustace was on his third margarita when he got a text from his sister, who was at a bar in Florida and, by some cosmic coincidence, had bumped into none other than Joseph Kittinger. Recognizing him, she went up to him and said, “Hey, did you know that my brother just broke your record?” Kittinger congratulated Eustace by phone the next day and invited him to have a beer sometime. Baumgartner, too, released a statement congratulating him. The next Monday, Eustace was back behind his desk at Google. Last December, Eustace’s suit was put on display at the Smithsonian’s National Air and Space Museum in Chantilly, Virginia. In the two and a half years since the jump, Eustace has given countless talks about the suit—at nasa, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, SpaceX. But most people still don’t know that Eustace broke Baumgartner’s record. “If someone says, ‘Hey, this is the guy who holds the record for the highest-altitude jump,’ ” he told me, “people will usually just turn to me and ask, ‘Oh, are you Felix?’ ” He retired from Google a few months after the jump to focus on his own projects—including consulting for a space-tourism company called World View, which MacCallum and Poynter helped form while Eustace was working on his jump. Ventures including SpaceX and Virgin Galactic have been working on ways to send civilians into space on rockets. World View is building an eight-person spacecraft that will float up into the stratosphere using a helium balloon, then detach and float back down with the help of a steerable parachute, like the one Eustace used. The trip will be significantly cheaper than going into space—$75,000 a ticket compared with about $250,000 for a ride with Virgin Galactic—which, if not quite democratizing the experience, will at least give more people an opportunity for perspective-altering views. Inside World View’s facility in Tucson sits a full-size replica of the Voyager capsule. It has four big windows and a bubble roof, so everyone on board can have a 360-degree view of space. The capsule has a small bathroom, Wi-Fi, and a bar. It will be a five-hour flight in total: one and a half hours up, then a couple of hours floating at about 100,000 feet before the descent. Eventually, World View hopes to hold wine tastings and photography classes in the stratosphere. The company is targeting late 2018 for its first flight. Eustace isn’t planning to go—he feels it would be anticlimactic. He had hoped to venture out in his space suit again, but ultimately decided that another jump would put too much strain on his family. So he takes every other chance he gets to launch himself skyward. A few years after he started working as an engineer, Eustace bought a bright-yellow Lockwood AirCam, a small two-seater with an open cockpit. He took me to see it one blustery afternoon in December, in a private hangar at the San Carlos Airport. We drove there from Eustace’s house in his Tesla, to which he had recently upgraded, at Kwan’s urging, from a 2002 Honda Accord. Eustace in his AirCam (Ian Allen) I had confessed earlier that I was terrified of heights. “Just don’t scream too loudly in my ear when we’re up there,” he joked as we pulled up to the hangar. “That could really make us crash.” We geared up: puffy pants and jackets and heavy helmets. Eustace helped strap me into the back seat, then jumped in the front. After a few radio calls to flight control, we pointed down the runway and took off. The plane lived up to its tagline—slow and low—and at first, it was almost like we were floating in a balloon. But as we got higher, flying over the tops of office buildings, the wind picked up. Although I was wearing gloves, my hands started getting numb. I thought about putting them in my pockets, but didn’t want to let go of the sides of the plane, which I was gripping with all my strength. We rose higher and higher and banked right over the San Francisco Bay. The water glittered below us, the bridge stretching across the horizon. After about 20 minutes, I heard Eustace’s voice in my ear: “Do you want to take control?” There was a small control stick in front of me, which Eustace had shown me how to use before we took off—a slight pull to go higher, a push sideways to turn. Still holding on to the side of the plane with one hand, I used my other to tilt the stick slightly to the right. The plane tilted to the right. “Oh!,” I said, in genuine surprise, forgetting my fear for a moment. “I’m flying!” Eustace just laughed. “Go higher!” he said.

The Pulitzer Prize–winning reporter Alex Tizon built an exemplary career by listening to certain types of people—forgotten people, people on the margins, people who had never before been asked for their stories. Alex’s wife, Melissa Tizon, told me recently that her husband was always impatient with small talk, because he believed that all people had within them an epic story, and he wanted to hear those epic stories—and then help tell them to the world. “Somewhere in the tangle of the subject’s burden and the subject’s desire is your story,” he liked to say. His mission aligned well with The Atlantic’s, and we were pleased to publish, in the April 2016 issue, “In the Land of Missing Persons,” a beautifully rendered story about ordinary people who mysteriously disappeared in the Alaska wilderness. And we were thrilled when Alex offered us the chance to publish a story he had been waiting much of his life to tell, the remarkable tale of Lola, the woman who was his family’s secret slave in the Philippines, and who remained their slave when they moved to America. Continue Reading Lola Dupre When Your Child Is a Psychopath Barbara Bradley Hagerty The condition has long been considered untreatable. Experts can spot it in a child as young as 3 or 4. But a new clinical approach offers hope. This is a good day, Samantha tells me: 10 on a scale of 10. We’re sitting in a conference room at the San Marcos Treatment Center, just south of Austin, Texas, a space that has witnessed countless difficult conversations between troubled children, their worried parents, and clinical therapists. But today promises unalloyed joy. Samantha’s mother is visiting from Idaho, as she does every six weeks, which means lunch off campus and an excursion to Target. The girl needs supplies: new jeans, yoga pants, nail polish. Listen to the audio version of this article:Download the Audm app for your iPhone to listen to more titles. At 11, Samantha is just over 5 feet tall and has wavy black hair and a steady gaze. She flashes a smile when I ask about her favorite subject (history), and grimaces when I ask about her least favorite (math). She seems poised and cheerful, a normal preteen. But when we steer into uncomfortable territory—the events that led her to this juvenile-treatment facility nearly 2,000 miles from her family—Samantha hesitates and looks down at her hands. “I wanted the whole world to myself,” she says. “So I made a whole entire book about how to hurt people.” Continue Reading Kamil Bialous In the Land of Missing Persons Alex Tizon  Two families, two bodies, and a wilderness of secrets They found what was left of him in the spring of 2014. Firefighters battling a huge blaze on Alaska’s Kenai Peninsula first spotted a boot in the dirt. Then they noticed some bones scattered across a wide grassy area. Fire crews in Alaska are used to seeing the bones of moose, caribou, bears, and other large creatures that live and die in these woods. So it wasn’t until crew members found a human skull that they stopped to consider that the pieces might go together. The skull was resting on its side, the face angled toward the ground. A few blackened molars clung to the upper jaw. The lower jaw was missing. The Alaska State Troopers arrived by helicopter and salvaged what they could. “The bones were close to being ash,” Lieutenant Kat Shuey later recalled. “They weren’t quite to the point where if you touched them they would disintegrate, but close.”   Continue Reading Gary Cameron / Reuters American Institutions Strike Back Peter Beinart The president’s incompetence may yet save the country that put him in the White House. The bad news is that Donald Trump is the most incompetent president in modern American history. The good news is that Donald Trump is the most incompetent president in modern American history. He was too incompetent to understand his own health care bill, or accurately describe the direction in which the “armada” designed to intimidate North Korea was heading, or restrain himself from disclosing highly classified information to Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and Russian Ambassador Sergei Kislyak. But he’s also too incompetent, it appears, to destroy liberal democracy. When Trump fired James Comey a week ago, many Republicans denied that he had done so to shut down the FBI’s inquiry into his campaign’s Russia ties. Trump, they said, could not have been that stupid. He could not have been stupid enough to believe that firing Comey would quash the Russia investigation. Continue Reading Leemage / Getty The Hot New Millennial Housing Trend Is a Repeat of the Middle Ages Ilana E. Strauss Communal living is hardly a departure from tradition—it's a return to how humans have been making their homes for thousands of years. For most of human history, people were hunter-gatherers. They lived in large camps, depending on one another for food, childcare, and everything else—all without walls, doors, or picket fences. In comparison, the number of people living in most households in today’s developed countries is quite small. According to the Census Bureau, fewer than three people lived in the average American household in 2010. The members of most American households can be counted on one hand, or even, increasingly, one finger: Single-person households only made up about 13 percent of all American households in 1960. Now, that figure is about 28 percent. Belonging to a relatively small household has become the norm even though it can make daily life more difficult in many ways. Privacy may be nice, but cooking and doing chores become much less time-consuming when shared with an additional person, or even several people. Water, electric, and internet bills also become more bearable when divided among multiple residents. There are social downsides to living alone, too. Many elderly people, young professionals, stay-at-home parents, and single people routinely spend long stretches of time at home alone, no matter how lonely they may feel; more distressingly, many single parents face the catch-22 of working and paying for childcare. Living in smaller numbers can be a drain on money, time, and feelings of community, and the rise of the two-parent dual-earning household only compounds the problems of being time-poor. Continue Reading Philip Montgomery His Kampf Graeme Wood Richard Spencer is a troll and an icon for white supremacists. He was also my high-school classmate. On December 17, 2007, the libertarian magazine Reason held a Christmas bash—a “Very Special, Very Secular Christmas Party”—at its office in Washington, D.C. The guest of honor, the late Atlantic book critic Christopher Hitchens, tugged liberally on his drink and gave a speech about how the holiday season was oppressive (“like living in fucking North Korea”). Then near the height of his powers as an anti-theist pamphleteer, Hitchens led the crowd in a tuneless rendition of Tom Lehrer’s “A Christmas Carol,” before slipping away and leaving the guests to the open bar and the mistletoe. Among those guests was a figure from my past. I had not seen Richard Spencer in more than 10 years. He was not yet known as our generation’s most prominent white supremacist. I remembered him as my eighth-grade-chemistry lab partner and high-school classmate. We spotted each other and walked closer, circling uncertainly for a few seconds, before he spoke my name and confirmed that a wormhole had indeed opened from late-1990s North Dallas. Continue Reading Mark Blinch / Reuters What in the World Is Causing the Retail Meltdown of 2017? Derek Thompson In the middle of an economic recovery, hundreds of shops and malls are shuttering. The reasons why go far beyond Amazon. From rural strip-malls to Manhattan’s avenues, it has been a disastrous two years for retail. There have been nine retail bankruptcies in 2017—as many as all of 2016. J.C. Penney, RadioShack, Macy’s, and Sears have each announced more than 100 store closures. Sports Authority has liquidated, and Payless has filed for bankruptcy. Last week, several apparel companies’ stocks hit new multi-year lows, including Lululemon, Urban Outfitters, and American Eagle, and Ralph Lauren announced that it is closing its flagship Polo store on Fifth Avenue, one of several brands to abandon that iconic thoroughfare. A deep recession might explain an extinction-level event for large retailers. But GDP has been growing for eight straight years, gas prices are low, unemployment is under 5 percent, and the last 18 months have been quietly excellent years for wage growth, particularly for middle- and lower-income Americans. Continue Reading Joshua Roberts / Reuters McMaster's Dilemma Rosie Gray The national-security adviser is the latest well-regarded official to risk his credibility for President Trump. Donald Trump campaigned against the “swamp” and the establishment — but as president, it is respected professionals with government experience to whom he’s turned in times of crisis. The latest well-regarded official to find his credibility pulled into Trump’s maelstrom of scandal is National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster. “The place that has the highest risk is in the White House,” said Eric Edelman, a former Bush administration Pentagon and White House official. “If you’re in the orbit of Donald Trump personally you’re likely at some point to be called upon to defend something that’s not defensible by normal standards.” McMaster was the official charged with Trump’s defense after The Washington Post reported that in a meeting, Trump had shared highly classified information with the Russian foreign minister and ambassador, who were accompanied by aides and a state media photographer. Continue Reading Evan Vucci / AP How Trump’s Defenders Are Inadvertently Indicting Him David A. Graham The strongest excuse for the president is that he had no idea what he was doing and unintentionally blurted out classified information—which isn’t very reassuring. The news that Donald Trump reportedly shared sensitive classified information with Russian officials during an Oval Office meeting last week produced four major reactions. There were some who refused to believe the Washington Post scoop, even though the White House still has not specifically denied that the president shared classified info, despite carefully parsed denunciations of the story, and despite confirmation by multiple outlets. There were others who dismissed the scoop, pointing out that Trump has the authority to unilaterally declassify information—an argument that is true as far as it goes, but ignores the real-world of implications of sharing such info on relations with allies, to say nothing of its hypocrisy.

Google rumored to announce standalone VR headset at I/O 2017 Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/05/16 5:13pm PDTMay 16, 2017 27 Plus 1 on G+ 34 Share on Facebook 44 Share on Twitter Total Shares105 News At last year's I/O, Google dipped its toe into the virtual reality waters by announcing Daydream (above). Like Gear VR before it, Daydream requires a phone to be inserted into a headset to operate. However, Variety is reporting that Google is set to unveil a VR headset that is completely standalone—no phone required. It's not clear what software this device would run, but Android seems like a good choice. Google already has lots of Android VR components ready to go. Google also has all the Project Tango technology to draw on. That may figure into a tracking technology that would set Google's new VR project apart. The real defining feature of this alleged headset will be so-called "inside-out tracking." That means the headset will be aware of your location in space without any external hardware, so setup is vastly easier. This is something being perused by several VR firms, including HTC and Oculus/Facebook. Even if Google shows this device off, don't expect it to be available any time soon. Daydream was announced at I/O and the Daydream View didn't come out until late that year. Source: Variety Tags daydream io2017 VR subscribe ...

Leon Yep, the future is a headset and a fleshlight. We're all doomed. whispy_snippet Hmmm you might be right. But I think VR has quite a bit more potential for compelling experiences if it's done really well. 3D kinda hit a ceiling in terms of what it could offer whereas VR starts above this ceiling entirely. OligarchyAmbulance The typical response of someone who hasn't tried it. Bruce Wayne Yeah, that must be it. I've never tried it. 🙄 Ryan I tried it, sold off the headset part after a few months. Its a fun toy but I dont play a lot of games on my phone and the VR content was limited enough that it just wasnt worth putting it on. Someday it might be there to compete with console gaming, but right now no. Zach Mauch Have you tried one of the high end desktop units like the Vive. It is a completely different experience. I ended up selling mine as well, but just because I wanted to while the price was still high. I know I will be purchasing more. Zach Mauch Totally disagree. How much have you used it? Have you tried an HTC Vive? The experience is definitely going to be huge and mainstream, but it will take a while to get there. This type of unit (standalone headset without external sensors) is where things are going and may actually be the first unit able to break out into the mainstream just like the iPhone did for smartphones. Too early to tell though. 4Ui812 No phone required .....but hand and video are a must. Google is slowly realizing the full potential of VR :-) The only potential. whispy_snippet I'm interested. Lare2 When is Google going to focus it's effort behind one product vision and push it hard. So now we will end up with cardboard sets. The VR one with the little control and now this new standalone one. Is Google replicating the mess it created with messaging apps in this space also. Geez Google. It appears as if you just hit puberty and are confused. Zach Mauch It is all building toward the end goal. They are stepping stones not fragmentation like the messaging fiasco. This will likely build on Daydream. Maybe Daydream 2.0. Fully compatible will all 1st gen while allowing for new 2nd gen capability. TechGuy22 With no games or apps in sight. No oem support. I'm sure it will sell millions. Nexus✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I don't want a stand alone vr headset, I want a google glass that doesn't suck. If snapchat can loosely get away with it, I should have a [face mounted] camera and heads up display for notifications, that simple. Nick Cannon Dying for AR here Grey Users: "We want news on Hangouts Meet and Hangouts Chat coming to everyone!" Google: "We hear you. Here's a VR headset after we failed to support VR after our last announcement." Alex Louderback Meanwhile, the Daydream platform is thriving and rich with content... But sure, they failed to support it. Ryan Its almost as popular as two of the android wear lines combined. I wouldnt be so quick to call it a success. Grey This is what denial looks like. Leroy Filon https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/35aa16784615bb53461bdeb316472b702338523767b50358559d2189e168ec43.jpg Ryan Cool, what 5 people were waiting for! Steven Dumeng It is absolutely worth noting that Google bought VR gaming developer Owlchemy (they made PS4 game Job Simulator) Zach Mauch Since we are so close, I'm actually rooting against leaks. I would like to be surprised. Rod Do people actually care about VR? Not a single friend of mine used their Gear VR for more than 1 month after the purchase. whispy_snippet Probably because mobile VR still sucks. In fact even VR connected to a super powerful PC still has limitations. But it won't always be this way. Lars Jeppesen I use my Gear VR every day to watch tv shows YuCMi I'll be very interested if Google increases the FOV, resolves screendoor effect, and makes it wireless. bass-ackwards Done Kwetsima Maluleke It'll flop.

By: Trends Desk | New Delhi | Published:May 17, 2017 9:42 am The Antikythera Mechanism’s discovery also came to be popularly known as world’s first computer. (Source: Google) Google is often known to commemorate important events of history with a doodle. This time, the search engine giant is celebrating the 115th anniversary of Antikythera mechanism’s discovery. In 1902, Valerios Stais, a Greek archaeologist, rummaged through artefacts from a Roman cargo ship’s wreckage that happened in Antikythera. He discovered a fascinating yet unusual piece of bronze in his ‘treasure hunt’ that looked similar to a wheel or a gear. This piece of metal was later established as a part of Antikythera Mechanism. It came to be popularly known as world’s first computer or an ancient analog astronomical computer.

Lead a study that showed Facebook can make users unhappy. Paul Wicks, vice president of innovation for PatientsLikeMe. (@PaulLikeMe) From The Reading List New York Times: Don’t Let Facebook Make You Miserable — "It is now official. Scholars have analyzed the data and confirmed what we already knew in our hearts. Social media is making us miserable. We are all dimly aware that everybody else can’t possibly be as successful, rich, attractive, relaxed, intellectual and joyous as they appear to be on Facebook. Yet we can’t help comparing our inner lives with the curated lives of our friends." WIRED: Maybe the Internet Isn’t Tearing Us Apart After All — "Suppose liberals and conservatives on the internet never got their online news from the same place. In other words, liberals exclusively visited liberal websites, conservatives exclusively conservative ones. If this were the case, the chances that two Americans on a given news site have opposing political views would be 0 percent. The internet would be perfectly segregated. Liberals and conservatives would never mix. PLOS: Facebook Use Predicts Declines in Subjective Well-Being in Young Adults — "The human need for social connection is well established, as are the benefits that people derive from such connections. On the surface, Facebook provides an invaluable resource for fulfilling such needs by allowing people to instantly connect. Rather than enhancing well-being, as frequent interactions with supportive 'offline' social networks powerfully do, the current findings demonstrate that interacting with Facebook may predict the opposite result for young adults—it may undermine it."   Read An Excerpt Of "Everybody Lies" By Seth Stephens-Davidowtiz Christiane Amanpour's 2017 Commencement Address At Northeastern University This program airs on May 17, 2017.

It will launch on new Volvo models within two years. The partnership promises to revolutionize how Volvo customers engage and interact with their cars. The large catalogue of popular Android apps - developed by Google, Volvo, or third party app developers - will offer connected and predictive services in and around the car. "We are making an important strategic step with the Google partnership. Google's platform and services will enhance the user experience by enabling more personalisation possibilities, while Android will offer increased flexibility from a development perspective," said Henrik Green, Senior Vice President Research & Development at Volvo Car Group. Volvo Cars' partnership with Google reflects the ongoing convergence between the automotive and technology industries as cars become increasingly connected. Volvo believes smart partnerships are the future for the car industry. Using Android as the base operating system will increase speed and flexibility in the development and offer its customers the ability to personalize the connected in-car experience. "We're thrilled to partner with Volvo to bring Android into their next generation connected cars," said Patrick Brady, Vice President of Android Engineering at Google. "This partnership gives us the opportunity to deliver a more seamless experience to Volvo drivers through a full-featured infotainment platform and rich ecosystem of Android applications and Google services." "With the advent of Android we will embrace a rich ecosystem while keeping our iconic Volvo user interface. We will offer hundreds of popular apps and the best integrated experience in this broad, connected environment," said Henrik Green. Volvo is also collaborating with Google on another initiative to update recent Volvo models by adding Google Local Search, a location based service application. This will be released through an update to customers with Sensus Navigation. Further details on the partnership and Android OS will be announced at Google's annual tech show, Google I/O on May 17.

Google rumored to announce standalone VR headset at I/O 2017 Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/05/16 5:13pm PDTMay 16, 2017 27 Plus 1 on G+ 34 Share on Facebook 44 Share on Twitter Total Shares105 News At last year's I/O, Google dipped its toe into the virtual reality waters by announcing Daydream (above). Like Gear VR before it, Daydream requires a phone to be inserted into a headset to operate. However, Variety is reporting that Google is set to unveil a VR headset that is completely standalone—no phone required. It's not clear what software this device would run, but Android seems like a good choice. Google already has lots of Android VR components ready to go. Google also has all the Project Tango technology to draw on. That may figure into a tracking technology that would set Google's new VR project apart. The real defining feature of this alleged headset will be so-called "inside-out tracking." That means the headset will be aware of your location in space without any external hardware, so setup is vastly easier. This is something being perused by several VR firms, including HTC and Oculus/Facebook. Even if Google shows this device off, don't expect it to be available any time soon. Daydream was announced at I/O and the Daydream View didn't come out until late that year. Source: Variety Tags daydream io2017 VR subscribe ...

Have you tried an HTC Vive? The experience is definitely going to be huge and mainstream, but it will take a while to get there.

Not a single friend of mine used their Gear VR for more than 1 month after the purchase. whispy_snippet Probably because mobile VR still sucks.

Netflix confirms it is blocking rooted/unlocked devices, app itself is still working (for now) Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/05/13 3:08pm PDTMay 13, 2017 234 Plus 1 on G+ 1125 Share on Facebook 427 Share on Twitter Total Shares1786 Applications News Earlier today, Netflix started showing up as 'incompatible' on the Play Store for rooted and unlocked Android devices. However, the app itself continued to work fine, leading some (including myself) to think it could have been an accident. However, Netflix has now confirmed to us that blocking modified devices from downloading the app was intentional. This is the full statement: With our latest 5.0 release, we now fully rely on the Widevine DRM provided by Google; therefore, many devices that are not Google-certified or have been altered will no longer work with our latest app and those users will no longer see the Netflix app in the Play Store. If you're not familiar with it, Widevine is a Google-made DRM technology that works across various desktop and mobile platforms. Widevine categorizes devices into three security levels, ranging from all processes running in the Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) to not running anything in TEE at all. However, the Play Store listing seems tied to a device's SaftetyNet status (which is used by Android Pay), rather than the Widevine TEE. For example, Artem's bootloader-unlocked stock Pixel is still on Widevine Level 1, the most secure level, but fails SafetyNet because it is unlocked. The update's changelog also confirms the: "Version 5.0 only works with devices that are certified by Google and meet all Android requirements." What isn't exactly clear is why only the Play store listing is blocked, but the app itself continued to function normally. I tried both Netflix 4.16 and 5.0.4 (the latest version, from today), and both worked without problems on my unlocked and rooted Galaxy Tab S (which is labeled as Widevine Security Level 3). Maybe at some point the app will stop working, but that does not appear to be the case right now. If you have a blocked device, I recommend following the Pushbullet channel for Netflix on APKMirror (click the Pushbullet button on that page) so you can continue to receive updates outside the Play Store.

First the vpn's now this... why oh why??? Jimk4003 Surely because licensing is regionally specific, and because rooting has the potential to defeat DRM. I get that it might be annoying for some people, but aren't the reasons obvious? David Juarez But root?? Lol Semianonymous Probably an effort to reduce Region spoofing? Idk how easy that is to do on a stock device. Jimk4003 Because rooting has the potential to defeat DRM. mjh49783ab DRM doesn't work. All DRM does is inconvenience the end user. Jimk4003 Possibly. But Netflix have to negotiate licencing deals with the movie studios, and having DRM helps reassure the studios that the movies they have spent millions of dollars making aren't going to get stolen off Netflix without any attempt to stop it. mjh49783ab One could make the argument that rooting the phone may compromise the DRM. But blocking users from unlocking their phones to switch carriers? That is total bullshit, and is just the sort of thing that encourages users to pirate the content. Jimk4003 Netflix are blocking you from switching carriers? lomsha Sim unlocked phones are fine, unlocked bootloaders are blocked. mjh49783ab They didn't exactly make that clear in the article when I last read it. h4rr4r The studios need to reconsider blu rays then. Way easier to rip. Nothing they do will stop piracy. This kind of thing actually encourages it. Jimk4003 Maybe studios do need to consider Blu-ray's. That isn't Netflix's problem though. h4rr4r No Netflix problem is making sure they don't let the studios reduce the value of their product. If Amazon video works on my devices and Netflix does not that is a big deal to me. In that case I might as well sign up for more addon channels on Amazon with the mkney that currently goes to Netflix. Jimk4003 Agreed. But the studios are responsible for making the product they redistribute. It's certainly a balancing act, and I can see both sides of the argument, but Netflix isn't an inalienable right, and those who don't meet the T&C's are going to miss out. h4rr4r Sure, but the studios and Netflix are going to create pirates with these kind of actions. People aren't going to miss out. They will just pirate what they can't get legally. Jimk4003 Sure, but again, it's a tiny fraction of users. If Netflix can negotiate better terms with studios by blocking rooted devices, and thus improve their business overall at the expense of a few fringe users, it stands to reason that is what Netflix will do. Doby Gillis whaa fucking whaa. Sergio Carmona The only obvious thing here is your sarcasm detector not working properly. Go have it fixed please. Jimk4003 Nah, I'm good. h4rr4r So the reason are to make the product worse for the consumer. Great idea, now piracy looks better and better. Jimk4003 What percentage of phones are rooted though? Most people won't care, or even notice the change. h4rr4r It does not matter, if it drives even one person to piracy that is a loss. Jimk4003 But if they can ensure better licensing deals via these new terms, which will attract more customers at the expense of a few rooted users who make up a tiny fraction of overall users; will Netflix care about that loss? h4rr4r But if it encourages piracy the other side of the contract should want to avoid it. Gaining customers in the short term like this hurts the whole market in the long term. Cyber_Akuma Because yeah, people are going to rip movies from Netflix and not off a Blu-Ray.... and even IF they were to attempt to rip them off Netflix, they would use a PHONE and not a PC.... Jimk4003 Ripping Blu-rays isn't Netflix's problem, and Netflix don't need to try and guess what device someone would try and commit piracy with, when the technology exists to restrict them all. Cyber_Akuma You are missing the point, people aren't going to be ripping from Netflix over ripping from a Blu-Ray, and on top of that, they sure as hell aren't going to be ripping off a phone. And actually, you are wrong, the technology to "resist them all" does NOT actually exist. There is no one technology that "restricts them all" but several different technologies for different platforms with various levels of viability and success. Jimk4003 I said 'the technology exists'. When did I say it was a single piece of technology? Let's not be those guys who get in a pedantic argument about semantics on the internet. Regarding the issue under discussion; Netflix's job is to make their platform as robust as possible against piracy, using whatever technology is available to them. Blu-Ray simply isn't their problem. Cyber_Akuma Because just arguing "technology exists" is worthless, plenty of technology exists, and plenty of it is misused. Technically the technology to remotely brick your phone exists too, doesn't mean it's fine to use just because it "exists". And no, their platform already is robust, you are trying to ignore the fact that people ripping movies off a phone is a complete and total non-issue just to try to argue for Netflix's sake, this is ESPECIALLY considering the fact that it harms far more legitimate people than it helps. Sorry, but no, just a plain and completely undesputable NO. You can't argue that it's ok to use something that will hurt a large majority of people just to potentially possibly stop an extreme minority of people who would not even use this method anyway. That's like arguing it's ok to burn down a house to kill a spider. Jimk4003 "You can't argue that it's ok to use something that will hurt a large majority of people". We're talking about Netflix blocking rooted users; in what reality do they constitute the 'large majority' of Android users? Cyber_Akuma I meant the majority of the rooted users. Last time I checked, over 25% of people with an Android device had root access, which is several million users. And OF those several million rooted users, how many do you think actually use their rooted phone and Netflix app to pirate content? Less than 1% Hell, less than 0.1%? They are hurting over 99% of rooted Android users, which while not the majority of Android users is still a lot, to attempt to stop (and not even that effectively as there have been work-around for SafetyNet checks for nearly a year now) an extreme minority OF a minority from doing something they are unlikely to do due to other methods anyway. Richard Markert >I meant the majority of the rooted users. Even the majority of rooted users is a drop in the ocean when it comes to Android users worldwide. Cyber_Akuma Again, over 25%. You also completely missed the point of the argument in that this hurts nearly all rooted users that would not use this maliciously. Lord Argyris Looks like I'll have to start updating manually then. Or just not bother with the app at all since I rarely use Netflix on my phone as it is. SpasilliumNexus Thank goodness the 3T's Open Beta of OxygenOS is good enough for me to not unlock my device and stick with complete stock. Now I wonder why I haven't received any Netflix app updates beyond 4.16.1 build 15145 on the Play Store, when APKMirror has 4 newer versions. ast00 They asked for it. Now pirate their content knowing that you tried doing it the legal way, but THEY declined. Φώτης Because unlocking your Android powered device is such a "bad" thing to do. Whatever Netflix.

Trust me, i m from a neighbour country ;) Me Or some Bixby xyz I don't think Google can translate dipshit. Seems to be a rarely spoken language. pcriz Um okay, whatever that means.

EowynCarter Yeah me too. And unless they change this, bye netflix account. No point in something I can't use anymore. Demoncat The funny part about video DRM is it's easily defeated. It's more convenient to steal the videos than to deal with the DRM restrictions. Fedup Exactly. Between VPN'ed torrents and nzbs, my Sonarr downloads all TV shows (netflix, HBO, ABC/CBS/NBC/FOX) automatically within minutes of them being ripped and posted by others. It is 100% automated, and with my Plex server running, I can watch shows anywhere - cost = $0.00. I don't do this to save money. I do it for the convenience, lack of ads, and freedom of time/place shifting. Heck, some shows actually download BEFORE they air on network TV (i.e. Designated Survivor). stan dex 97 new dark web premium links . also included are netfix lifetime membership links as well as graphic Live chat links (use anonymously) https://satoshibox.com/axbr7vnm6ifzk8hwtcreoe28/buy d0x360 I cancelled​ my account, sent them feedback and then just asked a friend who I let use HBO go and a Chromecast ultra if I could use their Netflix. David Gabel That seems rather dumb. Why cancel your service to them yet still use it via someone else? You're not teaching them anything. For an example, let's say you have a MacBook, and Apple does something to piss you off. You sell your MacBook, but then borrow a friend's MacBook. Nothing was actually accomplished. d0x360 Nothing was accomplished? I cancelled my account and let them know why. Now they aren't making money off me but I still to use their service. Your analogy is deeply flawed...deeply. So deeply I don't think you understand exactly what an analogy is. David Gabel So, you're "not giving them money" yet you still support them by using their product. It still seems like your logic is flawed. If you're really that pissed at Netflix, don't use it. Period. Use a different service instead of supporting them by borrowing it off a friend, as they are also giving them money (and support) , too via their subscription. revbones How is using their service for free "supporting" them? They aren't getting any revenue off you if you're not paying them. Saying you're supporting them by not paying them is a little stupid don't you think? xyz lol. So by your "logic" a person who pirates House of Cards is also supporting Netflix ? BobButtons You're doing the opposite of supporting. You're getting the benefits of their service while stopping payment and adding to server load which they pay for. David Gabel So far, your stance is the only one that makes sense. The rest so far are noise Sir Doogie Houser M.D.Esq. 200 You seen like an incredulous douch who I'd suplex onto a park bench for being a lap dog bitch.How is canceling or stealing not doing something.Also,its not a fucking macbook jerkoff its a paid service for TV on a phone they expect to be paid for.BTFO David Gabel And you are a loud mouth keyboard warrior that loves to talk a big game, but in reality have little to no control over anything and use web forums to spout obscenities and violent threats to make yourself feel better. nagi Just another step that makes pirating the same content more convenient... we should really be going the other way if they ever want piracy to be reduced. lomsha Funny thing is their content is available to stream all over the internet. Don't see how this move fights piracy as long as computers have access. This just alienates legit users who are doing nothing nefarious on unlocked/rooted devices. Richard Branches By one everybody pays... Pathum Addarapathirana Dude I root my phone to just get iPhone emojis and to tether without my carrier knowing. Like I'm not stealing anything this will just make me stop paying for Netflix. Latheryin Just a heads up. Those treating hiding mods are fake. There is no way to hide if from the carrier. Heck if they wanted to they could see every web page you load from a ton of different places and ways. Yan Minari That’s why god invented VPN Latheryin Yes but even then it doesn't block everything. qqqqqq My provider absolutely blocks tethering - I've been using various methods, including VPNs, to block it for literally YEARS... Hasn't been difficult. Dylan Harris That's not true. All you have to due to bypass tethering limits on t-mobile is to change the TTL on the tethered device. Latheryin That just gets by the automated checks. Get a live person to randomly pick your account (not really likely but happens) and it is not had to tell if someone is tethering. Dmitri Smirnov All that person will be able to tell is whether customer is using a lot of data or not. And this is the root of the problem: be honest that you are limited traffic, instead of trying to play this game of "we'll pretent we are giving you unlimited data and in return you'll only use small-format mobile device, so that we'll hope that you won't be able to use as much of it". Kind of "all you can eat, but you have to only use a tea cup and one chopstick". Latheryin No the issue is people being entitled and taking advantage of things. You have people running their gaming systems and using hundreds of gb a month. Not only is that kinda dumb but it violate the fair use act in most cell TOS. If people didn't abuse the system then it wouldn't be an issue. Also just some food for thought. If they can't tell anything more then a lot of data just how do they route the traffic properly? Make no mistake. If the carrier wanted to they could tell. I know for a fact that there is a team for both att and Verizon that is tasked with just that. Dmitri Smirnov >No the issue is people being entitled and taking advantage of things. You have people running their gaming systems and using hundreds of gb a month. "taking advantage" I thought that people were in their right by using what they paid for. Allright, tell me this - is it allright for me to watch 4K video on my phone (since the screens allow it now)? What's the difference between this and me watching the same stream on my laptop over my phone's connection? What if I just redirect the video stream to my TV using WiDi or any other technology? How is browsing a site from a laptop different from browsing it from a phone network-congestion-wise? And then it boils down to the same argument - carriers are just hoping you'll use the network less from you phone device, as it's less convenient. The more convenient smartphones become for consuming large volumes of traffic, the sooner carriers will have to more away from this scan and expose the actual numbers. > If people didn't abuse the system then it wouldn't be an issue. If carriers would be honest and upfront about "hidden" caps, then people would not be able to game the system. > Also just some food for thought. If they can't tell anything more then a lot of data just how do they route the traffic properly? Make no mistake. If the carrier wanted to they could tell. Latheryin Tethering was never even an extra charge until people started taking advantage of the mobile networks. Watching 4k videos is not a big deal, using 200gb of mobile data in a cycle is flat out stupid. Mobile networks were not designed for that type of traffic from a single device. Nor was it made to handle running your ps4 while you are gaming. Why do you think that pages are made to be mobile friendly? Not only is it a usability issue but a data usage issue as well. It's not hidden. All people have to do is read the TOS. It's all right there. Yet most people just don't want to take the time to do it and then get made about it. Can't blame the carriers for that. Dmitri Smirnov > Watching 4k videos is not a big deal, using 200gb of mobile data in a cycle is flat out stupid. a) I'm glad we're finally on the same page that the real problem for networks is data usage and not tethering or no tethering. b) You are aware that you're contradicting yourself in the same sensense? 4K 60Fps video bitrate is ~20-40 MiB/s which gives an average movie the size of about 72GiB. so by your definition watching a movie in good quality is OK as long as you don't watch more than 3 of them in a month. c) how is using mobile data that you paid for - stupid? If there are caps - announce them and make it impossible to go over them instead of shaming people who actually decide to take you up on your offer. d) tethering has not been an extra charge until telcos understood that they could charge extra for it (just like them toying with idea of charging extra for Instant Messenger traffic, because it undercuts their SMS plans). > It's not hidden. All people have to do is read the TOS. It's all right there. Yet most people just don't want to take the time to do it and then get made about it. Can't blame the carriers for that. Well, carriers are the ones calling their plans "unlimited" and hiding the actual caps either buried deep in the ToS or behind the vague "reasonable usage". So don't blame people for not wanting to wade through pages of legalspeak just to learn that you lied and "unlmited" is just "50Gb and then throttled". Fedup Agreed. The problem is the AMOUNT of data consumed by a given user account - no how it is consumed. If carriers are concerned about individuals abusing their network, then they need to flag those accounts that use an excessive amount of bandwidth - whether it's through tethering or directly on the device itself. I could easily burn through 150GB/mo on my TMO Note 4 w/o tethering simply by leaving my Blue Iris app connected and streaming 24/7. So it's actually very easy to abuse the system without ever turning on the tethering. Ravonus Damitri this guy is a nut ha... I agree with you 100% bro. Ravonus um yes you can fake it... Sure you can't block the traffic... but you sure can make it seem like the traffic is coming from your phone and not being used to tether.. Which is what these apps do.. SMH lol Latheryin If that is what you wish to believe. OK. Android Developer Is the tether solution needed even if you do it using USB ? Fulbring What a stupid move. I pay for the premium for Netflix and I never thought that I might have to cancel my service just because they did this. The only reason why I have root is because of AdAway and TitaniumBackup. I still use the stock OnePlus 3T ROM. Wasn't expecting this at all.... Kinda suck. Will be interesting to see how many customers they lose. Julian Berger Not enough to change it back... 4Ui812 DRM has no place in our lives. I suspect Netflix will have a change of heart within 6 months. Branko Xiaomi phones say bye bye to Netflix. Google go fuck yourselves. Steve_Jobroni Go fucking buy a windows phone. 天地人 Seriously though Windows phones are great. The only problem with them is the lack of applications. Otherwise, it runs great on low-end hardware, has a great UI, the homescreen is innovative, synchronisation with Windows PCs is cool, etc. dukaki Don't forget that you can use the Netflix website on Edge instead of their shitty app, and it streams at full 1080p, even on my L650 with a 720p screen. 天地人 Wait the Netflix application hasn't an option to stream at FHD? dukaki Nope, just 480p like on android. The device has to be "certified" and there are no certified windows phones afaik. The WP app doesn't even have downloads yet, I think. Edit: Just checked, no option to download here but you can on the desktop app. EowynCarter Might end with a visit at the apple store in my case. Windows phone is kind of not supported anymore. Jimk4003 This is Netflix, not Google. Cyber_Akuma Google invented this SafetyNet crap, let anyone use it for any reason (Hell, Pokemon GO of all things started using it), and over the last year have been making it even more and more strict and unforgiving. So no, a HUGE part of the blame does lie on Google for being openly hostile towards rooted users and not giving a damn about them. Jimk4003 There are legitimate reasons to use Safetynet to check the integrity of a device: Android Pay (or banking apps in general) is one example. It isn't necessarily hostility to root users; it's just a reality that Google need to be able to demonstrate to banks or other third parties that their OS is secure, and that people can't bypass built in security safeguards. Netflix need to do the same with the studios they redistribute content for; and they've chosen to use Safetynet to do it. Netflix isn't a human right; you have no inalienable right to root your phone and to use Netflix. Cyber_Akuma Except that not even my own banking app uses SafetyNet, it still has root checking and certain sensitive features are disabled if I am rooted, but not the entire app. Furthermore, it IS hostility to rooted users, because anyone can toss SafetyNet into their app for any reason whatsoever (such as games using it "just because" in case of cheaters... which doesn't even help at all to stop them). Google has been completely unwilling to work out ANY sort of compromise or method that can keep a phone secure without basically tossing rooted users under the bus. Jimk4003 What sort of compromise do you envision? Cyber_Akuma I am saying that they didn't even try. PCs by default obviously allow admin accounts all the time, even as the main user account (as much as that is not recommended) yet can maintain security. Google when they were confronted with people who were hurt by SafetyNet, legitimate users mind you, basically just shrugged them off and didn't even bother considering what could be done to allow the device to remain secure while also having such safeties in place. I mean, all these apps that you can use on your phone, can also be used on a PC, many of them available in either a browser or native app format, yet it remains secure. There is no reason this could not be done with Android, especially considering it used Linux as a base, they are just refusing to even consider it. Jimk4003 Don't you already have that choice? Your phone is sold without root access (i.e. no admin rights), and you can then choose whether or not to root your device and gain elevated privileges. If you do choose to root your device, you will lose access to some Safetynet enabled applications. You can, of course, unroot if necessary. Cyber_Akuma First of all, not all phones are. Especially in non-US countries. Second, it shouldn't have to be a choice. How many PC apps refuse to run under an admin account? Practically none. I shouldn't have to choose between having root access or being able to use a apps that more and more are starting to add this nonsense to them. Third, it's not even just root, even having an unlocked BOOTLOADER now, even if your rom is 100% stock and unrooted, can trip SafetyNet, it didn't used to be that strict. It's ridiculous to claim one should be able to have one or the other, even SafetyNet could have been designed to not be this brokenly strict, but Google had no interest in doing so, and they are rapidly making having root more and more useless while we still have to deal with all the junk they force on your phone from the manufacturer... that you can only remove with root. Jimk4003 Well, it is what it is. You believe you shouldn't have to make a choice, whereas I believe life is all about making choices and living with the outcomes. We seldom get everything we want, and neither Netflix, nor rooting, are inalienable rights. Whether or not you think it should be a choice, it is one; choose what you feel is best for you. Cyber_Akuma That's not even an argument, that's just trying to claim that the status quo should remain for no reason other than it is the status quo. It shouldn't have to be a choice, and arguing that people have to choose between root and having an increasingly less amount of apps just because "it is what it is" is insanity. In fact, it wasn't even the status quo before until Google started pulling this nonsense with SafetyNet a short while ago. That doesn't mean people should just accept it. Jimk4003 It's not an argument, because there is no argument to be had. The reality of the situation is self-evident; you can't have a rooted device and install Netflix via Google Play. Accepting the status quo has nothing to do with it; it's simply acknowledging reality. You have to choose what's more important to you; Netflix or rooting your phone. Finding the reality frustrating, as you clearly do, won't make it any less real. If this was a serious discussion on human rights; censorship, migration, justice, gender equality etc., then it's important in a democracy to be aware of your rights and responsibilities, and challenge the status quo where necessary. But this isn't anything like that. This is two for-profit corporations, Google and Netflix, who provide services to which you have no fundamental right to access, nor any obligation to use. You can choose to pay for their services and accept their terms and conditions, or you can choose not to. You don't get to pick the terms and conditions of the service someone else is providing you; however you are free to not use the service if you don't like the terms and conditions under which they are provided. That's it; it's no simpler or more complicated than that. Ranting on the internet about how unfair you perceive it to be is irrelevant. Again, it is what it is. Cyber_Akuma Again, there is no "it is what it is" argument. There should be no choice, PERIOD. You are basically saying that people should not complain about this just because "it is what it is". No, it is NOT what it is, it should NOT BE what it is, and people can and WILL complain that it SHOULD NOT be what it is. You aren't even making any rational arguments anymore, just re-stating what the current situation is and then basically claiming that people should not want or expect better. Jimk4003 You can want or expect better if you like. Netflix, like every other for-profit enterprise in a capitalist system, will either succeed or fail based on its ability to turn a profit. Right now, Netflix is turning a profit, and clearly thinks it can be more profitable by excluding rooted users whose theoretical ability to circumvent DRM restrictions may impact its ability to secure rights to new content. Clearly you disagree with their stance, and the only way to see for sure if your disagreement is warranted is to watch their financial performance from here on out. None of the above changes the fact that you aren't entitled to Netflix. You've chosen to root your phone, and Netflix have recently chosen to exclude rooted users. That leaves you with a choice to make. Even if you think that choice is unfair, even if you think you should be able to have both. The reality is you can't have both, and you will have to choose. Again, Netflix isn't a right. Go elsewhere if you disagree with their business practices; that's how capitalism works. Beyond that, you're just having a spat with reality; and that's a tough fight to win ;) Cyber_Akuma Actually, what do you think would lose them more profits, the theoretical minority OF a minority that MIGHT rip movies on their phones (which still requires a Netflix account in the first place) or blocking that 25% minority? Also, drop this "right" nonsense. No, seriously, drop it right now. People are paying for a Netflix account, they DO have a right to get the service they paid for. Netflix made zero warning or mention of this impending block, they pulled it out of nowhere for paying customers. So sorry, but they DO have a right to the service, since they are paying for it. Sony was found to be legally in the wrong when they removed the OtherOS feature from the PS3, because why? Because people PAID for the console when it had that feature, they DID have a right to what they paid for. You're just having a spat with arguing for argument's sake when you don't even have an argument. Jimk4003 There is no argument; it's the reality of the situation. Netflix have implemented DRM controls that block access to the Netflix app via the Play Store on rooted devices. I do understand why Netflix want to tighten their DRM procedures, and I do understand why some people have been left frustrated by this change. The reality is, however, if you want to download the Netflix app via Google Play, you will need an un-rooted phone; such as the phones used by the majority of Android users. That's all that's happening. I get that you don't like it. But stamping your foot and shouting 'no fair, no fair' achieves nothing. Netflix are entitled to run their business how they see fit within the law; and consumers get to choose whether they want to give Netflix their business or not. That's all there is to it. Don't like the way Netflix do business; don't give Netflix your money. Cyber_Akuma All you are doing with the "it is what it is" argument is just repeating what the article is saying. That is not conductive to anything. Anyone who has read the article knows what is happening right now. And sorry, but you are doing the same stamping your foot with the "well, it is what it is" argument. Not to mention that you are also wrong, because over the last 5 or so years ALONE there have been dozens of examples of consumers speaking out against policies or DRM and the companies begin forced to reverse it from the backlash. So you are doing nothing but hurting legitimate users by trying to argue "it is what it is". And again, no, they are not entitled to run their business in a way that without warning locks customers out of what they paid for, Sony tried this... and got in legal trouble and lost. So sorry, but you are wrong, and you have been nothing but wrong this entire argument. Netflix isn't' "entitled" to do this, people DO have a reason to complain, there IS a reason to complain, complaining HAS changed such practices before, and all you are doing is further hurting legitimate users by attempting to insist the "it is what it is" non-argument. Your entire argument has been fundamentally wrong from the start. Jimk4003 It's not my argument; it's simply Netflix's position. I get you don't agree with it, but it's totally valid for Netflix to wish to strengthen their DRM procedures. You do know I'm not responsible for Netflix's decision making, right? It is what it is; I wouldn't get too upset about it. Cyber_Akuma Again, "it is what it is" is not a valid argument. Jimk4003 No it's not an argument. Again, there is no argument necessary; the reality of the situation is self-evident, and no amount of arguing here will change it. The fact is this; YOU rooted your phone. You weren't forced. You should have known that by rooting your phone you are modifying the device beyond its factory specification. You should have known that this essentially makes you responsible for the proper operation of the device; you no longer have the device manufacturer or Google to turn to when software that you have modified doesn't work as expected. You should also have known that rooting prevents a device from complying with the compatibility test suite, and that this can affect your devices ability to function correctly. You should have been aware of the SafetyNet API, and anticipated the fact that this API would be adopted more and more broadly as Google promoted its usage. You can't blame Google for this; as before, once you modify your device beyond its factory spec, you're responsible for supporting yourself. Rooting a device is at the owners risk. You've now found yourself in a situation where a modification you have made to your device prevents you from accessing a service you want to use. That's on you; no-one made you modify your device, no-one said they would take responsibility for the changes you have made to your device, and rooted users are expected to assume liability for any ramifications and complications they face as a result of their decision to modifying their device. Netflix are well within their rights to enforce DRM on their product by using the SafetyNet API provided by Google, and the Google documentation clearly states rooted devices will fail the CTS check. This documentation is publicly available. You went ahead and rooted your device anyway. That's on you. It's no-one elses job to make sense of the decisions you have taken. You're free to carry on using Netflix if you return your device to a state where the integrity of the device can be verified. Or you're free to carry on using a rooted device and living with the compromises that entails. Your choice. Cyber_Akuma I don't think you get it. All you are doing is parroting what the article is saying. Furthermore, despite there being plenty of examples of complaining doing EXACTLY what you claim it cannot do, that is to change such decisions, you keep repeating that "complaining will do nothing". You are a broken record, arguing the same "it is what it is" argument over and over so you can avoid actually thinking. An argument (and yes, no matter how much YOU stomp your feet that it is not, it IS an argument) that has already been disproven over and over and over. You also ignored that there are many countries where phones are already sold rooted, or how such things don't effect using such services on a PC with admin rights which are the same thing, or the dozens of other holes in your logic large enough to sail a ship through. There is no "you should have been aware" because this is a total lapse in common sense and my device is in no way incompatible from a hardware or software level, but rather, the app is purposely rejecting it. Furthermore, they made no prior warning whatsoever. This is like arguing "you should have known modern cars could be remotely disabled" if a dealership decides to just disable all cars with an aftermarket radio installed. I don't know where to even begin with all the broken wrong logic in that last post. Why are you even here if you couldn't care less? You are free to carry on being a living example of "First they came", but don't come crying about how nobody else is listening to you because you could not possibly be any more wrong. I DO have a right to use Netflix on my device, rooted or no, if I am paying for it. If you argue against this, you are wrong. People DO have a right to root their devices, if you argue against this, you are wrong. People DO have a right (and have many many MANY times in the past) to challenge the "it is what it is" status quo, if you argue against this, you are wrong. And I know you WILL argue against this, which will mean that, see above, you are wrong. I have been more than patient with your insane thick-headnedness. At this point I can't tell if you are being willfully ignorant or really are just that ignorant. Or just trolling, that is an option as well. There is no way anyone rational at this point can continue to argue the insanity that you have argued. Jimk4003 I interpret personal insults as an indicator that the individual making them no longer has any faith in their actual arguments, and so I think it's time to call time on this particular discussion. As you've pointed out, neither of us is getting anywhere. It's been fun, but once it starts getting abusive, the fun has to stop. It's a shame, because DRM Vs individual user rights has the potential to be a really interesting discussion topic. I hope you get what you're after; and that the reality of the situation will change to be more in line with what you think it should be. Unfortunately I imagine the situation regarding DRM and rooted devices will only get more restrictive going forward. Take care. Cyber_Akuma You purposely instigate people into losing their patience with you, and then claim "I win because you got angry", especially when the anger is because you were refusing to understand the entire argument throughout this entire mess. My1 even if you dont have any right to access netflix, the whole point of netflix and others is making it easier to use those than to do piracy but when netflix goes around branding the rooted users as pirates and blocking them, they sure arent helping their purpose. especially if netflix is (I dont have it so I didnt try) runs on VGA and DVI Screens (no HDCP) where you can just capture the stuff. I mean it's say same withz Bluray Playback on PC, in addition to needing a Bluray Drive, you need an HDCP Compliant Graphics card, bus encryption, and HDCP compliant Monitor, and not to forget You Piece of PowerDVD which you have to upgrade (aka buy again) every few years because the older versions dont get Key Updates. and then we have stuff like unskippable trailers and all the other bluntly said Bullshit when dealing with that. of course Piracy is easier, just download the file and play it on any device you want, no internet and nothing required and no problems. My1 and even if one piece of software wont run in an Admin account, with LUA even on Admin they arent having and privileges unless you kick in the UAC, and to top it, even if the app wont be running if I force it as admin, and only runs with active LUA concept, I can still run anything else as admin and screw the other software running as normal user over (cheatengine is the perfect example for this) Richard Markert Root is, by definition, unsecure. Any time you have userland processes that have access to ring0 you are inherently unsecure, as there are no restrictions placed upon running code at that point. Cyber_Akuma And yet, there are ways to run it securely on PCs. Netflix and online banking would not be available on PCs if it wasn't. My1 well but from another side, root can also be used to just patch any holes that were there. actually happened a few times before. My1 banking apps dont have a reason for a root check if they are done properly, i.e. TANs are generated with an air-gapped extra device. TANs on the phone are in general not safe and if the TAN is able to be generated offline, someone could use an exploit to root, steal the secret for TAN generation and boom, it's over. and dont even start thinking about sms-TAN, it's even worse. also when I just want to look into what my account is doing, I am not happy when I cant do so. My Bank (Hypovereinsbank) more or less recently blocked root and well I just RootCloaked that thing into oblivion and can do my stuff. but I'll probably change anyway since they sadly have no good way of TANs (just paper-based list-TANs, SMS and app) TedPhillips mostly agree. by providing a turn-key 'lockdown' check, and further by ret-conning it into playstore access (let's see how far they take that) -google is now openly hostile to anyone who bought into android for it's ability to customize and truly 'own' your own device. the open source roots of android was a big differentiator vs something like iOS, but now that they have dominate market position - they are walking away from that without concern. (only worrying about how slow they need to boil the frog to get away with it) meanwhile, what middle manager is going to say 'no' to adding safetyNet checks in their app or play store listing? it is an easy way for them to write down on potential risks, unjustified (which it pretty much always is) or not. blindexecutioner So the solution is to install from outside the play store. That's great for security. Way to go. Richard Markert No they don't. Since Windows 7, new and default users are not Admin accounts. koiulpoi Sorry, this is absolutely wrong. The first user created on a Windows PC has full administrative access, limited by UAC. You can still delete System32, it's just mildly harder than it used to be. If "new and default users" were not Admin accounts, they couldn't install software, so... Richard Markert Default user accounts are higher than Limited accounts, but not as high as Admin accounts. That's why they can install software. Linux users are not admins but can still install software, right? It started on Windows 7, expanded in 8/8.1 and now in Windows 10 a user account behaves just like a user account in Linux. It has no access to %systemdir% unless you manually go in the folder properties and give your user account Admin permissions to it. You can still run things AS admin by giving the permission at runtime, but since all that requires is pressing a button (if your built-in admin account isn't passworded, which it isn't by default, one step forward two back, sigh) and most users are too "stupid" to simply not press that button. koiulpoi It's really funny when people speak authoritatively about something they're so wrong about. The first account created by the Windows OOBE is automatically added to the Administrators group. This means they're an Administrator. They have Administrative privileges. The fact that certain actions are blocked until you click "yes" on a simple UAC prompt doesn't stop this; they're in "Admin Approval Mode", which can be disabled via GPO if you care to. If you buy a computer from Dell (example), set it up, then go to System32 and start deleting .dll files, it'll ask for administrative privileges, but you can click yes and away it goes! Some files are protected at "SYSTEM" level, which is higher than administrator, but DEFAULT USERS ARE ADMINISTRATORS. This has ABSOLUTELY nothing to do with the "password" on the built-in "Administrator" account. That account is disabled out-of-the-box. Please, you're digging a bigger hole trying to look "right". How to prove this: Set up a new computer. Set up user default for MS. Start -> Run -> netplwiz -> Be amazed that your user is part of the group "Administrators". TechGuy22 Haha kodi Doesn't matter to me I Stopped paying for Netflix long time ago. C64 Haha Teranium TV 😎 TechGuy22 I like that too. You can even get the mod one and remove the ads. Lol C64 I know, i always use those. I want to pay for the dev, but there's no option to do that. Koko time is coming with a big update to tim242 Thief. Renato Santos This is stupid. Congratulations, Netflix. Jan-Lk Else It is also getting more and more necessary to unlock / root devices due to missing updates etc. But I'm not a Netflix customer and won't become one. C64 Whahaha, this has to be the most retarded move of the year in any category (even Trump can't top this). I'm glad i don't use Old Crap Flix. A Person Hillary, then Netflix. C64 Nope sorry. Since Trump is your president i can't take America serious anymore A Person Timeout, you're not even a US citizen? No interest in your opinion. James F Wow. Just wow. I can't take you seriously either if that's how you treat people. Not cool, man. A Person "Wow, just wow"? When he can vote in our elections I'll take his opinions of our elections seriously. It is highly ill-informed anyhow. Paul Sterling A person wins! Marcelove Timeout, you are a Trump supporter? No interest in your opinion (neither anyone smart in the world). Roy Riddex Just so I'm clear on this, by unlocked are we talking about SIM unlocked? lomsha No no, unlocked bootloader. Roy Riddex Thanks Corbin Davenport Unlocked bootloader. pbergonzi I wonder how long they'll stick with that premise seeing as how much public opinion expressed here is against them. Screw them. Get the APK somewhere else or install magisk and hide your root. Too many people root their devices and have a good reason for doing so and Netflix should not penalize them. Doby Gillis Dude, normal people don't give a fuck about rooted phones. It's just the elitist twats who do it anymore. twiz0r Dude, you're an elitist twat. Richard Markert Most people who root seem to be. The sentiment among rooters is "if you don't root your phone, you're not as good as me and don't deserve to have a phone. Root you stupid noob!" twiz0r thanks for confirming your twatness. good day. C64 One word ..... Bullshit Corey Kinard I've yet to see that... Maybe you just feel like that because they do in fact know more than you? Richard Markert My first version of Android was 1.5. I've seen it for many years. How long have you been in the scene? My1 well at least a rooted phone is objectively better than a non rooted one, but relatively and subjectively speaking, if a non-rooted phone is good enough for someone then let it be so. EowynCarter My phone isn't rooted. And not compatible anymore ! Franco Fassio Unlocked bootloader maybe? EowynCarter Yes. But seam I can't lock it without wipe. So screw you Netflix. Marcelove Let me guess, your profile pic is that right? https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/0f0c4f3e3ce40074aebfe58d80511d4a0b7d4a94896ce54d82e448a1cd2e3ceb.jpg bruce lancaster Dude. It isn't just rooted phones - Also unlocked. Elitists get their iphones and galaxy s8s from att and verizon. Normal people get their devices from amazon, ebay, newegg, gearbest etc. Jimk4003 I'm sure Netflix are terrified that the tiny fraction of Android users who come to this site, and the similarly tiny fraction who root their phones, are bothered. The rest of the world won't care. bruce lancaster An article in Wireless Week (cellphone industry rag) a couple of months back says it's now a majority of phones in Asia that are unlocked and Europe is getting pretty close to 50/50. US passed 30% unlocked around Christmas. People aren't getting their phones from ATT, Verizon, etc any more now that they have to pay full retail and don't get a free or heavily discounted flagship device with contract renewal. They are getting them from Amazon, Gearbest, Newegg, etc and moving their sim. If I owned stock in Netflix right now, I'd sell it quick on this news. Everything that isn't already mobile is going mobile. Alienating half the European market and 30% of the US market is asinine. Fedup Yup. Ditched my flagship Samsung phone for a 'budget' Moto G5 Plus that is 100% compatible with all four US carriers (and their dozens of MNVOs). Swapping providers is as easy as changing the sim. And despite the slower spec'ed hardware, the carrier bloat-free Nougat is WAY faster than my TW Galaxy phone - and the battery life is INSANE. C64 Probably 90 % of the people don't know what root is. Almost every person I know owns an Android device, but i'm the only geek who flashes and roots his devices bruce lancaster It isn't just rooted phones but also unlocked phones. Got your phone on amazon? Got it on ebay? Got it from gearbest? Got it from newegg? Yup. No netflix for you without jumping through enough hoops that you'll actually know about rooting by the time you get it done. Fedup Are we conflating a carrier-unlocked vs. bootloader unlocked phone? They are two distinctly different things, and I doubt that having a carrier-unlocked phone (i.e. using a TMO phone on ATT, or VZ on Sprint) has any impact on SafetyNet or Widevine. pbergonzi Judging from the posts here it looks like nobody who roots their phone uses Netflix anyway so I guess it's moot. But the outcry sure did get them a bunch of free publicity. T4rd This is what Magisk is for. Pretty sure if I can still use Android Pay with my rooted 6P, I can still use/update Netflix through the Play Store. Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ Magisk still requires that you unlock your bootloader, which is enough to trigger safety net these days, so that won't work. TechGuy22 You don't know how magisk works do you Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ I understand that Magisk is a great tool for modifying my system without actually modifying it. I understand that there are many modules that allow you to do things like hide root, bypass security modules, skin your system, and plenty of other things. What I don't understand is how you can install magisk without unlocking your bootloader. Back when I originally tried it out with pokemon go, it worked well for a while, but eventually even just having my bootloader unlocked was all it took to throw SafetyNet. If that's not an issue anymore, then great! But maybe say that instead of being snarky. Thomas Gladdines Bootloader can be simply locked after rooting and installing a custom recovery. Edwin O. Lol no You could, but then you can't flash anything with said recovery... So no point Thomas Gladdines LOL the recovery doesn't stop working after a bootloader is locked, only fastboot won't flash images but the recovery can do whatever it wants to, update the rom, edit system files etc. Muzzy996 Well as an example for the Google Pixel: https://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=71901761&postcount=454 In this case all it takes is a kernel that supports Magisk and hides the fact that the bootloader is unlocked, at which point with Magisk Hide enabled all root and SafetyNet checks pass. Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ Excellent. I'll have to look back into this then, last time I used magisk it wasn't as capable, glad to see it's come this far. sbeaulieu Magical Hide is there for that Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ Can Magical Hide hide that my bootloader is unlocked? Serious question, not being sarcastic or snarky as I was below. sbeaulieu It does make the SafetyNet check pass iJeggu Magisk itself doesn't hide an unlocked bootloader it only hides root but must custom roms simply delete the verifiedbootstate -flag which in turn makes safetynet pass even with an unlocked bootloader. Some older devices don't have this flag in their kernels in the first place so safetynet will accept that the flag is missing. Link to the patch that most custom roms (kernels to be specific) have to pass safetynet: https://github.com/sultanxda/android_kernel_oneplus_msm8996/commit/abc05b16bbd33521c2fffaf491c5657a94bfcfc5 https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/5b1ff3f47e32d5f57ddadcd650a5b94725bd4e6242cea92e269f51e988d0d426.png T4rd Except it's working for me right now... jonzey231 This has been happening for a week now. I tweeted it to Ruddock a few days ago. Just didn't put together that it was because I was unlocked. https://twitter.com/jonzey231/status/862122438125072384 steelew Google really needs to start stealing from the root community the way apple takes from the jailbreak community. It feels like rooting is way down except for a few (legal) use cases. If it weren't for visual tweaks & usability tweaks, I would have no need to root (personally). This kind of stuff starts to make rooting unpleasant. I already can't use fingerprint auth in my banking app any more because root. Jesús Cuenca They do. I used rooms for like 8 years maybe? And a lot of the "new features" always come of the rom or root comunity. Right now i use roms, but not root. Marcelove I'm trying to stay indoors, but is complicate... Greenify for example, works at no root devices nowadays... But is way better with root and Xposed... Doze can't compare against Greenify... Maybe at version number 20 root wouldn't be necessary... Sandeep Raghuraman What about the version downloaded from Amazon app store though? Does that work fine? TwoBit Gary It worked, but it is old version without show downloads. Go to apkmirror oculairmedia Interesting move. I flashed a custom ROM on my Nexus 6 because stock was so slow that it was getting unusable, but screw me right ? Atoqir In my country lots of stuff doesn't work on unrooted devices. My bank app, payment app and local cable TV and digicorder app all stopped working. Also s-health doesn't work anymore and soon Netflix. Time to unroot Marcelove "Time to unroot" Sheep. Richard Markert Rooting is insecure. You don't need to access the system partition except to break things. Benjamin Walburn If that were the case then this wouldn't be an issue. Nobody is looking to break their phone. Richard Markert Few people I've talked to online know what they're doing when it comes to root. Most of those end up breaking things. Rooting is far too easy and probably shouldn't exist at all. Benjamin Walburn You could say the same about anything, not just modification of phones. Maybe you shouldn't own a car if you can't fix it yourself, or have kids if you aren't a doctor. Rooting isn't easy, it's made easy by the hard work of other people. It's not up to you what other people do with their property, you have no right to say that they shouldn't. And if someone breaks their phone, what does it have to do with you? It's their hobby and their phone. You're not their daddy. senoredusty Or use Magisk DJMix No need. You could use magisk su hide for the moment. it still passes the safetynet. I too use a banking app that cannot be used on normal root proocess faceless128 "please stop giving us money and use Kodi instead" Sounds like a great business plan! JD For the sake of Kodi's developers don't say Kodi in that context. ericshmerick Hrmm, every time I hear Kodi, I think of pirated content. Guess when people are like "I use Kodi for my 30TB media collection" I stop and wonder how... Yes, ripping a lifetime of DVDs, but nah. Probably piracy. C64 I know a few how really use it legally Powsniffer0110 Yea I use it legally 95% of the time. ErectBipedal nah man, I use Kodi to browse my 30TB of linux isos. Totally legit I swear. Chazz Matthews Torrents are legal too. Just depends on the content. Mike Honestly though, if pirate add-ons wern't available on kodi, 98% of the people using it now would not have even heard of it before. Even bad publicity is good publicity. They are not going to publicly come out and say it, but the add-on's are the only reason they're well known. Andy Roid But kodi makes piracy so easy! Blian Oh god, please stop. Nobody is using Kodi for their DVD rips. Railwayman I rather say Fusion and Exodus et al instead since Kodi is... Kodi and you have to install what you want. The Netflix business plan is for her more people on Exodus, Phoenix and SALTS - not to mention Terrarium TV and MovieBox as well. Kevin Strident Kodi is open source. If Kodi stops wanting to be as useful as it is now, someone will fork it and keep it doing what its users enjoy. cbstryker Kodi is just an open source media player. To watch any pirated content you either need to download it or install an unaffiliated plugin that streams from pirated sources. C64 Next kodi wil have drm build in. So people have to use forks. I stopped using kodi since i found Teranium TV. cbstryker That makes zero sense. Kodi's reason for existing would stop. C64 That's BS my friend, Kodi (xbmc) has started on the original xbox and was made and used as a media player My1 actually it depends on how the build the DRM, if it's made to be only active when you are for example streaming netflix and does nothing for local content, which for sure can be legal (e.g. ripping DVDs in finland is no problem because CSS is not considered an "effective" protection method ever since 2007) although if the DRM would be everywhere it wouldnt be funny. Justin D Same...but with Plex and something else >.> Dany Lol I know right? I was using Kodi more than Netflix anyway so... Dmitry Stepanushkin Xposed + RootCloak or something similar will do it for most of apps for those who need root. So I think not a big problem. Abhishek Saral Not a big problem but a big annoyance. tehboogieman Hmm, rootcloak isn't working for me with netflix m477 No, it won't work. Safetynet always fails if you have closed activated, or if you just have an unlocked bootloader. Sometimes even by just having adb debugging turned on. My1 debugging is a joke right? If it's not WHAT ARE THEY DOING? I mean debugging is a core part of developing and any developer probably has it active m477 I've only seen it working like that once, so it might be an isolated case. Kan☆n MagiskSU and its manager app comes with a very good hider built-in. No Xposed needed. h4rr4r Beyond pointless. Netflix won by being easier than piracy, this threatens to turn back the clock on that. Lexster These companies don't seem to get that most people pirate because it's easier/cheaper than buying what they want. Yes, it's wrong, whatever, the point is streaming services made it easier for people, which outweighed the hassle of pirating it. You're right, this kind of thing is what will get people to start doing it again more. BobButtons If I can't use Netflix on my rooted phone, it's Netflix that'll go, not the root. They're encouraging piracy. YaKillaCJ Exactly. Screw it, I only have Netflix for convenience. This will also have negative impact on many devices and average consumers even if they never unlock or root. A lot don't have Google certification, such as upcoming OEMs. Then theirs beta roms like Xiaomi and OnePlus that run awesome. Marcelove Funny thing: I was about to become a subscriber of Netflix after seeing House of Cards by PirateBay but now through the official channel because I thought that Netflix deserved my money... Look : deservED... But this movie will keep me at PirateBay... Funny thing 2: I have a Moto G5 that I could unlock and root and I didn't it just because I wanna see how things are nowadays without root... And I use a lot of apps that would work better with root (Greenify for example)... So I would be able to use Netflix... And I won't and will stay that way only because this douchebag move... Congratulations Netflix... Funny thing 3: So happy that I waited till House of Cards release to become a subscriber... Netflix should learn something from Frank Underwood... And from Blockbuster... tim242 Yeah, sure you were. Once a thief, always a thief. koiulpoi This is the most untrue statement I've read on this website. Thomas Elephants can fly 天地人 http://gadling.com/2012/06/10/airline-transports-herd-of-african-elephants-photos/ koiulpoi Nice! You matched it. 天地人 Yes, because illegally pirating from huge corperations which constantly attempt to and successfully brainwash people into agenda using various tricks, is somehow bad? You're not supporting the creators of the show, sure. But you're also not supporting the 6 Jewish companies that control 90% of American media. Anyways, with your little money you wouldn't be benefitting anybody. Do you honestly think those Jewish companies are dying to get a hold of your $120 you payed for Netflix this year? Probably not. The creators of the show, are well off anyways. Don't companies pay them to have their content on their platform and pay for their production cost and wages? Then; they've already been payed. I'm not endorsing piracy. It isn't the best thing to do, but I think calling people a "thief" and grouping them with people who have actually stolen things off individuals which mean a lot to the individual and murdered some individuals in the process, is just stupid. It's not the same as 'stealing' bits of 1s and 0s. Again, I'm not endorsing piracy, however there are a lot of good reasons to pirate movies and TV shows. Paul Sterling You're a thief. People leave their families for months to give you works of art. Games, movies, music. You can't throw them a few bucks? I'm legit, always will be. Also, tax helps everyone. Your wall of text is just trying to convince yourself, thief. 天地人 Nope. A thief is different from a pirate, besides, they've already been payed. And I was talking about TV shows and movies, but you're too dense to realise it. jj14x Not the same. If I spend time writing code for software, and decide to sell a monthly license instead of a perpetual license, that is my choice. Your choice should be to either subscribe to the monthly license, or to find a competitor software to use instead. Choosing to bypass the licensing checks makes you a thief (taking something without the owner's permission makes you a thief). And same logic applies to TV shows/movies. If you want to own the movie and watch it whenever you want it, BUY it. "illegally pirating from huge corperations which constantly attempt to and successfully brainwash people into agenda using various tricks, is somehow bad?"<-- YES - it is still illegal. Just because somebody stole your car doesn't mean you can go and steal that person's car in retaliation. There are laws and procedures on how to handle that. STDog Illegal != bad, legal != good. Thousands of unjust laws have been passed. They made actions illegal that were not bad. My1 well yeah if you actually bypass the thing you are a pirate (not a thief because stealing != illegal copy) but branding people pirates and making the software refuse if something that MIGHT be used for piracy is on the device isnt not better. Richard Markert It's trickle-down, man. Think about if everybody thought like you. Netflix has 100 million subs and each pay at the minimum $107/yr and that's 10.7 billion. Now if that 10.7 billion were wiped out in an instant, how is Netflix going to make new shows or seasons of existing shows? It's the same with the rest of the content creation business. You and me, we're just a drop in the bucket when it comes to their revenue, but instead of scooping it out a spoonful at a time while adding water by the cup, somebody dumped the bucket over, there would be no money left to pay the content creators before content is even made. Railwayman I guess you like DRM and proprietary vendor lock in? The only moral of the story is: Pay for legit services then and watch posted content - the creators get paid and you get proper content without restrictions. The day the industry realize that DRM, geo blocking and so forth are counter productive will be historic. My1 well I would and I do give my money for legal media consumption when possible but when some things have region locks, meaning I cant import them or other stupid Ideas like Netflix not doing rooted devices, I certainly wouldnt like giving money for something I cant use. My1 not really. I have streamed and/or downloaded stuff in the past (coz not available here) just to buy their blurays years after when it finally came to germany Fedup Love my Moto G5 Plus. Best phone I've had so far - and that's coming from a number of Samsung flagship phones. It's so much snappier and the battery life is insane. I waited a full 48 hours before caving and unlocking/rooting. Haven't looked back. I hate ads, and w/o root, you can't miracast to anything other than chromecast. Trysta Noticed this a little while ago. The crazy thing is I'm not even rooted or interested in any mods. I needed to sideload the latest version 7.1.2 because my RMA Nexus 6p refused to update on its own. I'm keeping the bootloader unlocked so I can recover if my phone boot loops. I rarely use Netflix on my phone but this is kind of annoying. I suspect this has something to do with offline movie watching (which is amazing). jj14x You don't need to unlock bootloader to sideload the full OTA images that Google publishes on their website. Tim Harman But you do need it to recover in your phone bootloops, as he said. jj14x True, but by that logic, everyone should keep their phone's bootloader unlocked all the time (because a bootloop, in theory, could happen to anyone/anytime) - not just when flashing a factory image. My1 but doesnt the actual unlock wipe everything? EowynCarter You don't ? Had to when installing a developper preview. Then I left it that way, so I won't be locked out in case of boot loop. TedPhillips or when you have some random block on disk get corrupted, ala nexus 9. ilovetesla Dumbest blocking I've ever heard Bruce Wayne I stopped rooting ages ago. Android has gotten so good that I don't need it anymore. Muzzy996 Good for you! Not everyone feels the same though, I know I sure don't. Tasker, Adaway, Greenify, Titanium, Substratum and GMD Gesture Controls are all more important to me than Netflix. The day Netflix stops working on my rooted devices (which are what I watch it on, not my TV) is the day I'll cancel my service. No big loss compared to losing root. Richard Markert Tasker is interesting but never felt the need for it. Adaway, titanium are both irrelevant on my S7, I despise gestures beyond simple swiping in the Cardinal directions, and if stock Android is so perfect why do you need to theme it? C64 I have a s7 edge and the stockrom is full of bloatware from Microsoft, Sansung and Google. More than 20 useless apps are included. So yes the s7 needed root. tim242 Wrong. Package Disabler, no root required. Richard Markert No, it doesn't. Everything not necessary for function is disableable. C64 You can't disable everything Muzzy996 Never said android is perfect, if it was there wouldn't be any competition in the market or users such as myself who feel the need to customize Android. Root is not something I push onto others, its just something that I want on my devices and I make choices about what services I use or devices I purchase based upon my ability to do it. Railwayman I take that you like ads, then? Using a non-rooted Samsung without Taller would be like using a feature phone again but with ads. Having an automated device without ads and bloat is certainly a basic requirement to me. Richard Markert Adhell and Disconnect pro. What's an ad? Railwayman I don't see any ads on my Ericsson GF388 either. Don't have to install a single piece of software in order to get there. Ericsson win, Samsung loose.:) Your Samsung still has Google ad services and so forth running even if you are blocking them on the "non root level". My devices are completely ad free with Google ads disabled system wide and in all apps. Samsung loose every time even if their followers are trying to find different "non root methods" to "solve" things that other devices do without any issues due to... root. kostas110 maybe if you use some 500+ euro smartphone from 2016-2017 something that not everyone can do C64 I disagree, Android is one big advertising if you don't use root. Apps have ads (not every app has a pro version), internet browsing sucks without Adaway (build in ad blockers in browsers aren't great), YouTube really sucks if it isn't modded (watch a 30 second ad for a 3 minute movie). And devices are full of bloatware that can't be removed without root. Even the Google stuff are bloatware (kiosk, movies,music,books etc). I also like to remove alot of system apps and replace them with my own apps that i prefer (file manager, agenda, email, music/ video player) and i really hate duplicate apps on my devices. Also Titanium Backup is important to me. So Android​ without root isn't Android for me. jetscreamer01 I use adguard to block stupid ads in my apps. Now using any commercial apps is enjoyable. Richard Markert Samsung's Internet has the Adblock extension and it literally blocks everything. I also use Disconnect Pro and Adhell for system-wide ad blocking. Titanium Backup I never really used even back when I was rooting phones - it has been replaced 100% by Smart Switch. But then, I haven't needed to restore a backup (except for switching devices) in years, probably because I don't run janky community junkroms. Muzzy996 The only reason you feel that Smart Switch completely replaces Titanium is because you never used other features of Titanium that go beyond what Smart Switch is intended for. Things like shortcuts to freeze/defrost apps, multiple version backups or market management are useful to some even if they're on rooted stock OEM ROMs. They're not must haves for the masses though but some of us do appreciate their usefulness. Cyber_Akuma I hate this response. If anything, I have found far more reasons to root than ever before. Being able to create a backup image and install security/tracking software tat can't just be wiped/uninstalled easily is a big one for example. Captain_Invisible But you don't even need to root to get blocked. Just using a custom ROM or having an unlocked bootloader triggers it.. DJMix I really couldn't understand these kind of stupid moves. I mean I kinda get for an Android Pay or some banking apps to implement these limitations. But seriously, a frickin' streaming app? Afraid they're gonna get pirated? For someone who's going to pirate, they probably could just probably reverse engineer the apk and remove the limitations or basically use older apps. Do they really have some idle engineers that they're forced to implement useless feature? ddevito Guess I'll just pirate it all soon. Their loss. JD Fuck Android If OEMs would fucking provide updates for 5 years I wouldn't need to unlock my bootloader. I'm out. I'll come back when Google fixes this shit. Also fuck Netflix. Back to pirating it is. Christopher Bement My app stopped working on my N7 when I sideloaded 5.0. Got an error when trying to play anything. I went and dropped it back to stock on the latest patch and relocked the bootloader. All working fine now. Too fucking bad, Nougat is fantastic on that device, leaps and bounds better than Marshmallow. tehboogieman Which ROM and which N7 do you have? I still have the stock ROM on my 2013 N7 LTE and have been procrastinating loading an N ROM on it Christopher Bement 2013 LTE version and I was using Nitrogen OS (fantastic and stable ROM). I am now on the latest Marshmallow just so that Netflix will work. tehboogieman As long as I can side load it and sign in I'm still ok. It's a pain, but I'd live with that. But if NF blocks root users from signing in, I'm definitely cancelling and just use one of the very easy pirate apps. Fedup As long as you can side load... Sure. But going from "hidden app in the Play store" to "sideloaded app won't run" is probably on the menu. Wayne Randall I just signed up for Netflix so I could cancel it. I'm part of the group. tim242 You paid them... Richard Markert Hahahahahaha I don't even use Netflix on my phone (screen is too small) so I don't care. But man, the tears and butthurt from the root community is hilarious. Benjamin Walburn You're a very petty child. Richard Markert When something makes me laugh, I point it out. I do that even have a dog in this hunt. I only watch Netflix on my 75" LED TV. I'm just tired of root users smugness. Almost as smug as apple users. Benjamin Walburn You're tired of people being smug in their hobbies, so you gloat about the problems inflicted on them pointlessly? Petty and a hypocrite. Richard Markert What else am I supposed to do to remove the smugness? My name is…. Get a life maybe? Benjamin Walburn Why should you? Is another person's happiness really that painful for you? You already know that they accomplished nothing more than "successfully followed instructions." It seems like your purpose would be better served by targeting that, not just being a jerk. Humbling them is one thing, being an ass is another entirely. tim242 You sound like the petty child. Stomp your foot, becauseyou don't get your way. Benjamin Walburn Not only am I not doing that, I'm not not getting my way, and "stomping​ my foot" is not an example of pettiness. Your wrongness-density is impressive. My name is…. Who beat you as a child? Richard Markert Lol koiulpoi You're on androidpolice.com... making fun of the root community... and unable to see past the end of your nose... Don't you have anything better to do? Richard Markert Actually, no. I read Android police because they have the best coverage of software. koiulpoi I didn't realize I replied to you twice. You're all over this article, with really, nothing better to do, huh? Richard Markert Yeah, I'm bored. I'm probably done stirring shit up anyway, today is water change day on my fish tanks. lomsha Tard Railwayman Are you one of those Samsung Apologists that argue against root and proudly tell everyone about the perfection known as Grace UX... just to install Package Dsabler Pro because... something disturb all "perfectness" of their system? Trying to be an "anti-social elitist" is like proudly use Simple Finder on a Mac and tell everyone that you don't need the regular Finder.;) Richard Markert I use Samsung, but only because it offers the best mix of software and hardware for me. And package disablers are garbage. Railwayman I avoid Samsung like a plague because of Knox 0x1 Warranty Void, Grace UX (TW...) and pretty ugly hardware not to mention the software design, which looks like a cheap toy, both colors, design and all S-This and S-That they preinstall. Don't forget DT Ignite so the carriers can add their share. It is always amusing when the Samsung Apologist proudly claim how good it is to live without root and how "mature Android has become" when they are talking about a heavily modified fork of it. If Samsung could replace Google Play with Galaxy Apps, they would. The only thing restricting them from further modification is the CTS in order to be able to use Play. An unrooted Samsung running Grace? It would be like having a feature phone again. Way too many annoyances and no way of making it more pleasurable since the whole thing is... Samsung. The only area where there are some reminiscence of Android is under the About box. Samsung is a disgrace not to mention a complete parody on the concept of an Android device. Not to mention their followers who recently "spotted" the bezel less display (introduced by Sharp and LG followed by Xiaomi) because... the S 8 got it AND suddenly made it a "requirement". The most kind thing I can say about that brand is this: Samsung is for the Android device and platform what McDonald's is for the thing called food.;) There are way better devices available. Buying a Samsung is like getting a Big Mac (the difference is that the Big Mac buyers doesn't claim its superiority - while Samsung buyers always try to claim how "superior" their devices are). Richard Markert Everything in your first paragraph is purely subjective. I find the design of the Pixel to be ugly, boring and derivative. AOSP design language doesn't appeal to me. I also think Samsung's software suite is better than Google's. My 935U doesn't have DTIgnite, but my 935V does...as does the Verizon branded V20, Moto Turbo2, etc. DTIgnite is a Verizon thing. Bezel less phones are sexy, for sure. That Sharp device was a Sharp device, and the Xiaomi has a CDMA radio so I could use it on Verizon , but just can't justify buying a thousand dollar device from China. It is stupidly gorgeous though. I use Samsung because I like the software design. I like the functionality of the base is and apps, and I like the S-app suite. I really miss my Note 7, and I'll be swapping up to a Note 8 when it's out. Don't get me wrong, Samsung phones have their negatives - chief among them is the fragile design and the screen edge touch rejection sucks ass. But for me, the positives outweigh the negatives. Other phones have bigger negatives for me. No IP68, no uSD card, no wireless charging, no SAMOLED display. Phone preference are always subjective. Somebody will always have a reason to pick one over another. Tell me, if Samsung is a "parody" of the concept of an Android device, what is your description of the perfect Android device? I'm guessing it's the Pixel. Railwayman Pixel is an ugly iPhone clone. The best Android device so far would be something like a Xiaomi Mi Mix running Resurrection Remix or similar ROM or something like a Mi Max but with perfection added through a Snapdragon 835, 256GB storage plus microSDand 6-8GB RAM paired with a 1440p 6.44" display or even 4K. 5000-6000 mAh battery. My Xiaomi Mi Max is excellent but would be even better with the aforementioned hardware (I can't fault is existing hardware but I am taking about a new model). A keyboard flipcover would be a great accessory as well. There are no device yet worthy of the perfect moniker yet but my Max is the best thing so far in my collection beside the Nokia Communicators and HTC TP2 and HD2 and also the Xperia Z Ultra when I do the holistic judgment. IP68? Sony all the way to me if I really insist. MicroSD? No need for a Samsung in order to get it. Yes, Samsung is a kind of a parody of an Android device die to their heavy modifications, restrictive policies, low price /performance ratio, carrier branding and Knox 0x1 Warranty Void. The upcoming OnePlus 5 looks promising - they usually get their things right. MicroSD on that one as well.;) If Samsung make a device without any BS such as restrictions, carrier links paired with good price / performance ratio I would be interested. Let's call it a Note Pro. What I don't like with Samsung are all Apologists making excuses for their policies. I have nothing against them as a company or production. They can make excellent products but their policies stop them right now. It is too much McDonald's mainstream and too little class at this time. Carrier devices are typically too mainstream than the unlocked ones. My1 well knox flag is annoying but I honestly like my Galaxy Note 4 which is the last good Samsung in my opinion becase anything later either doesnt have microSD, doesnt have a swappable batter or doesnt have both (Galaxy S6 for example) but these are 2 very important things and I really like some parts of the samsung rom, although a lot of other parts (e.g. the launcher) are junk and get replaced instantly, also root makes the thing work as I want. and well many non samsung devices use the on-screen navigation bar, one thing I despise after having a horrible experience on my tablet. and (at least outside of samsung) the fiun goes on with removing the headphone jack which is something on my absolute instant KO list for phones. I dont see the point of a digital sound connection on a phone because sound itself is analog by definition and I think the DAC in a multi-hundred euro device is better than in some cheap headphones. and not to forget the features. samsung had many features WAY earlier than AOSP did, which certainly doesnt make it so much better at least from this viewpoint, although aosp is certainly getting better with every version. but even though I like my note 4 I must say that it is by no means perfect. everything is better and worse than others if you put the right requirements in. MadMartigan What are are you, seven? me me A primary reason to root is to run adblock because Google is way too greedy. So the irony, Google's greed means there's less reason to pay for NetFlix. Let me guess... shall we? Google Play Movies still works right...? Oh yes, so long as Google makes their money.... tim242 I block ads with Adguard. No root required. Mike | Homeless On Wheels People still use Netflix? Bit Torrent is your friend. dizel123 Exactly. Everyone should stop using Netflix. Not sure how I'm gonna get the shows i currently watch on Netflix from bit torrent since they won't be made anymore once Netflix is shut down, but at least I'll have my bit torrent friend tim242 Some people like to do things properly. Railwayman You mean - Do it with DRM? You can't buy whatever device you want because a content provider disagree. You can't use the system you want because a content provider disagree. You can't use the app you want because a content provider disagree. I need a lot of apps, ads and limitations for the so called "proper way" . The "improper way" is Samsung free, ad free and bloat free - and I don't need several apps because I have just one or two streaming apps, one media player, one book reader and so on. Fast and efficient system to boot. I think I prefer to do things "improperly". Richard Markert >The "improper way" is Samsung free, ad free and bloat free - and I don't need several apps because I have just one or two streaming apps, one media player, one book reader and so on. Fast and efficient system to boot. *sigh* I bet you think deleting the APKs from /system actually gives you more space in /data, too. Railwayman Perhaps you can tell me the benefit of having Kindle, Kobo and Nook instead of MoonReader for everything. The benefits of having an uprooted system, Netflix, Hulu and a couple of apps for different cable services instead of having just one media center would also be interesting to know more about. When we are at it: Why would I want to use a 3GB+ Samsung ROM when Resurrection Remix are 600 MB and the G-Apps around 340 MB? Richard Markert I dont use any of those. Phones are too small for media consumption. I don't have any video streaming or playback apps on my phone. Nor do I have book readers, but why wouldnt I want Kindle? It's the only way to access the Amazon library... Oh wait, I forgot, you do that believe in compensating content creators. Resurrection remix, really? If I put that on my S7 edge, I'd be wiping out half the hardware's capabilities in one blow. No Samsung pay, no edge panels, no pro mode camera, no AOD, no game tools, no GearVR. And im sure none of the little things I've come to expect in my UI, like direct calling and sliding a contact to call/txt. But I can move the clock to the other side of the notification shade, woohoo! Oh and does the installer for RR rom repartition the file system? Because if not, /system will still be 3gb, not 600mb. And on top of that, I'm immediately reminded of iOS when I looked at their screenshots. Railwayman So RR looks like iOS? Interesting. It looks like Android with Material Design on my device. I buy Kindle books but send them through a plug-in since the Kindle app pretty much suck in comparison with MoonReader. Sometimes I also buy from Google Play Books and it is also a trip through the plug-in for them and then into the MoonReader library. You see - DRM is a stupidity that must go way unless they create a device wide scheme so any app can authenticate and show or play back the content. I understand that Samsung phones are too small for media consumption. A 6.44-7 inch display is different - it works comfortably without the heft of a 10-12 inch tablet. Small displays below 6-6.3 inches are just too small. So your listed features of your Samsung are hardware? They certainly sound like software to me. Or do you seriously believe that Samsung use co-processors in their device like Commodore did on the Amiga? I can assure you that your Samsung contain standard hardware with a lot of subcontracted components, especially in the US market where they even use Qualcomm CPUs. Samsung Pay? Why would I use an OEM dependent payment system? My credit cards follow a standard, why should I pick myself into a specific device OEM just to pay? It makes no sense. It is like having a car that only runs on Citgo gas or a 4" Visa card requiring different terminals than my 4.5" MasterCard. Mobile payments will be a thing when a standard are in place. Payment systems requiring me to lock myself into a specific OEM just suck. Edge panels? Don't see the need. Don't like Edge displays with their optical side effects. Flat display or just slight roundness on the edges like the BlackBerry PRIV here. Pro Mode Camera? I prefer to have the Open Camera API so any app can get RAW from the sensor and do their thing rather than locking myself into the default camera app. I prefer Camera FV-5 or A Better Camera etc. The Snap Camera is good too. Always on display? Can set it up on my device but don't see the need when there are things such as Active Display and a lot of other options. Game tools? I don't see any problems with gaming on other Android versions so I just don't see what Samsung can add in this regard. Gear VR? Why would I want to strap my device to my face when there are dedicated VR headsets available for gaming consoles and computers? I certainly prefer to have a full headset rather than using my device as one. Call features? They could be good but carrier calling is old fashioned. I use Google Voice instead and wouldn't consider going back to carrier talk and text. Don't see any benefit with having a phone number tied to a carrier of SIM card. Having more than one for different purposes on the same device without SIM dependency is the modern way. I don't know if RR repartition Samsung devices so you have to check XDA. That brand is probably the worst when it comes to ROMs anyway and a lot of my dislike of them are related to that particular issue. Samsung is nothing more than the Big Mac of Android devices and no Gear VR or Samsung Pay (it is like having a McDonald's Pay) really change anything. A mainstream device with mainstream design with too many round edges and corners not to say fragile, batteries that wear out fast due to lower quality and fast charge (which stresses the cells heavily), a software design looking "something" , bloat ware, carrier BS such as bloat ware and also the price model, Knox and root/ROM restrictions, locked bootloadern - the list goes on and on. Mainstream degenerated art is what Samsung represents. But I know the existence of people who don't believe in freedom of choice other than the freedom of buying their Samsung from their carrier and then happily oblige and reduction imposed to them all the way down to the SIM card dependent phone number and roaming charges when they travel.;) They also consider Samsung Pay to be the best thing ever - a payment system that only work on a particular OEM. It really is like a car that require Citgo gas and is unable to run on Exxon or Esso fuel. Samsung just are the Big Mac of Android devices. There are just nothing "classy" over such a carrier mainstream brand. If you want to know what luxury are? Look at Vertu. Richard Markert A 7" device is too small. My tablets start at 10" minimum , and go to 12" maximum. Content consumption is unpleasant on anything smaller, and I barely watch anything on a display smaller than one of my 24" computer displays. Yes, you're right almost all of them are software features, but they are locked out when you put a junkrom on there. And Samsung Pay? Well, call me when Android Pay is compatible with magstripe readers. My bank still doesn't support Android Pay that I know of, either. GearVR. How shall I put this? Computer VR is currently overpriced - unless you want to go ahead and buy me a $600 headset, a pair of controllers @ $130 each, AND you still need to buy me a $1400 PC to run VR titles at an acceptable framerate, because while my laptop can still run AAA titles at high framerates and 1080p, it can't do VR that good. My GearVR cost me $50, it's a convenience thing, every VR title is locked 60fps, the graphics are "good enough" and I can even take calls from VR with my Bluetooth headphones. I don't care about Google Voice. Or any sort of data-based calling. US data networks are still too unstable and limited. I am pretty much guaranteed to be able to make a call anywhere I can see at least the tiniest bit of 1x signal, but if the data network is gone, or you used all your gigabytes, you can't make calls anymore on your preferred number. A lot of these things you say you simply "don't need" them, and that's how I feel about root. And about pretty much everything you care about. I don't do ebooks, I don't do movies or tv, I barely play basic games. I do listen to a LOT of music though, and yes a lot of it was stolen from when I was younger and stupider and didn't understand that without compensation there will be no content. Oh, and BTW, Knox is a good thing. It's how I have system-wide ad blocking without rooting, and how I can have my Secure Folder. You seriously think Vertu phones are luxury? Classy even! Vertu are tacky, garish and gaudy. "Look at how much money I have." Nothing classy about that ugly diamond-crusted turd. Look, I really don't care what your choices are. I'm glad you have the choice to find a device that makes you happy. But you seriously need to stop acting like your choice is the only choice. It's not. And I hope to god it never will be, because at that point, Android will no longer be a platform that fits my needs and I might as well go to Apple. Because you see, what fits my needs, is a device that provides me with everything I have, out of the box, without having to modify it. Samsung does that. They give me everything I want, and nothing I don't. And when the Note 8 comes out, the S-Pen is going to blast it so far ahead that there simply won't be any other phone in the running, not even the S9. I would still have my Note 7 if they would let me. derp_cookies So I agree this is a dumb move but everyone is overreacting by threatening to pirate content. This is a niche problem as less people root now, especially since Android pay won't work when you do it. So Netflix isn't any less accessible than it was before. I watch 99% of Netflix at home on my Roku. Luxferro It's not just rooting. My Nexus 6P is running stock google rom, no root, w/ just unlocked bootloader, and netflix is gone in my play store. Not that I watch TV on my phone... but my shield tv is also unlocked... so it's probably just a matter of time. Roh_Mish Dammit Netflix, you make me want to go popcorn time route. My current primary phone and my iPad are what I use to watch netflix and both of them is stock so i don't have anything to worry about but this just feels wrong. Between this and Amazon not releasing the TV app for my sony TV, which they support outside, popcorn time (and in extension piracy) just seems easier. Vivek Rameses This is why we have piracy. Miguel Angel But ...why? occono Distributors want Netflix to stop any possibility of making DRM-Free backups on the content. Railwayman Good luck with that. If it can be played, it can be recorded. As long as the Netflix content is visible somewhere a copy can be recorded so again, good luck with blocking. Mariano Moreira Even more strange is while Netflix app is removed from Playstore, Netflix VR is still.in Playstore. Manually flashing Factory Image for Google Pixel is how I get me OS updates and I choose to leave bootloader unlocked, rather than relocking every month.(which would include full wipe) So I guess they don't care about security for the few users whom might use Netflix VR with Daydream compatible device? tehboogieman I'm not familiar with the Pixel, but almost every Nexus device lets you lock without wiping all your data. Maybe that requires root though, I really don't understand the details on how it works, but hopefully you can find a way to do it. Mariano Moreira To clarify: In order for me to install Factory Image every month, I need to have Bootloader unlocked. Doing the Factory unlock will wipe the device. Locking the device doesn't wipe the device, but Factory unlocking the bootloader will wipe the device. tehboogieman Yeah, sorry I wasn't more specific. I use an app called BootUnlocker. It lets you lock and unlock the bootloader without wiping at will. Since an app can do this, I'm assuming that it can be done via ADB. Also it might only work on older devices, but maybe there's a way to replicate this action on newer devices as well Mariano Moreira I don't understand why Google is promoting Security by having the device fully-locked, yet still relies on ADB fastboot unlock/OEM Unlock commands to flash factory images? saf1927 Why are using factory images when Google provides OTA images too, and these don't require an unlocked bootloader, nor a wipe? jdrch It's not just Netflix. The HDHomeRun Prime app doesn't work on rooted 7.0+ devices either. Jsilvermist Good to know, will no longer recommend Netflix to anyone when I'm asked... James F News flash: when you explain to most normal people why you don't recommend Netflix, they won't care, because it doesn't affect them. D13H4RD2L1V3 This is stupid. I had to root my phone to be able to hide the navbar at any time I want and also to gain better battery management controls and other stuff that I sorely wished Google had added to stock Android way sooner. And I was considering a Netflix subscription. No longer...... Sruly J I know it's not fully a solution which is "worth it", but the app Custom Navigation Bar offers the ability to hide status bar/narbar without root. Although like you said, you had other reasons to root, so... My1 yeah, I do root for theming and stuff, but srsly they literally are throwing oil in the Piracy and DRM discussions with this. Diar I pay for Netflix so I can watch the content any way I want guilt free, whether that's their app or other locations on the Internet. F their VPN blocking and DRM. If they make their app impossible to use, I just won't use it. They'll still get my money but they will lose any data/tracking since I'll still be watching their shows, just outside of their ecosystem. Dummies. ReedSolomon Between the SJW nonsense like Bill Nye, the ipv6 tunnel blocking (rather than simply defaulting to ipv4), increases in price, less and less quality content, and now this, I see little reason to keep paying for Netflix. robogo I understand Netflix' reasons, I really do - they need to protect their property and investment. But I can't really say I understand the way they're doing this. This is a good way to alienate the small percentage of power users who root their devices for various, but perfectly valid and understandable reasons. And no, this will not make me cancel my membership as long as the app works. Cancelling membership is a silly, overblown reaction to what is, in my mind, a minor nuisance. D13H4RD2L1V3 I personally just find it a dumb move. Seems like an easy way out. Dmitri Smirnov > perfectly valid and understandable reasons. And what reason would that be? Preventing people from ripping their content? Doesn't stop them in the slightest, root-detection in circumvented rather easily as well as safety net, we have PokemonGo to thank for that - a lot of people were motivated to crack it and they succeeded. > Cancelling membership is a silly, overblown reaction to what is, in my mind, a minor nuisance. Cancelling membership is valid form of feedback to the company, that trying to tell it's customers that they are not allowed to own their device that they paid their money for, if they want to watch a movie. robogo You misunderstood, it seems. A perfectly valid and understandable reason to root one's device would be, e.g. Xposed framework, theming support, tethering, backing up stuff with Titanium Backup, etc. Please read my comment once again. EowynCarter Well, if and when it stops working on my phone, what will be a major nuisance. robogo Agreed. I'll have to find another way then. But I'll deal with that when the time comes. Manbearpig I member when netflix released there app for Android and they did the same thing. I would just download the app and be good to go. After awhile though I stop rooting I miss it sometimes Cyber_Akuma I warned people when Pokemon GO of all things had a surprise update that silently added SafetyNet that this garbage was going to become more and more common. Mario RUN uses it too, and now Netflix.... soon apps everywhere are going to add SafetyNet and block rooted devices as standard practice. Google has been incredibly hostile towards people who actually want to own or have control over their devices or even their PC Software over the last few years. And over the last year google has been making SafetyNet more and more harsh, now even tripping if your BOOTLOADER is unlocked even if your phone is not rooted. Pokemon GO and Mario RUN were a small crowd, but I hope after Netflix of all things starts using it (and make no mistake, this is just the beginning) that people will finally push back against Google's hostility towards rooted users. EowynCarter Yeah. Or I might seriously consider going the iOS way. Though iOS would pose other problems. (Bye paylib) BillPosters I rooted my Android phone to get rid of the annoying camera shutter sound, and to prevent apps from stealing my contacts, and to basically take control of my device rather than letting Google run the whole show, and because of that I can't update Netflix? Good riddance Netflix. iKon I'm pretty sure you can go in the camera settings and take of the camera shutter sound?.... .. In some region-specific firmware versions or certain devices you can't do that. Railwayman There is a better solution: Declare the device a DRM free zone and use everything else. DRM to me is "Don't Restrict Me!" and an excellent reason to give certain companies the middle finger telling them to just go and F themselves. The most ironic thing here is that removing Netflix or using DRM otherwise doesn't stop piracy. On the contrary - By buying and using DRM content you get to travel in the cargo hold with no heating while the pirating consumer get first class service: more content, no restrictions, no copyright trailers or ads before the movie start and stop on. Even better: They can use whatever apps or ROMs they want. Would I unroot my device in order to get DRM content onboard? No way!!! If Netflix are so scared - block the client on Mac OS X and Windows et al. Piracy doesn't usually happen with an Android device as a source but rather computers and HDCP rippers. Another thing also to the DRM companies: Everything that can be played back can be recorded! (Good old piracy saying) Netflix out, Fusion with Exodus, SALTS and Phoenix in. Kodi with Rapier skin is much nicer than the Netflix client and Trakt integration make this way a much better one than going down the DRM route, sitting with an uprooted stock ROM and Netflix.;) TechJunkie198 ? netflix isn't scared. the studios require the drm. and netflix isn't concerned with the small percent of users who root their devices. Railwayman Doesn't matter. Go and enjoy your DRM services.;) DRM is a pest and that is why the pirating community offer a superior product. It is easier and more hassle free to just put Netflix where they belong and use Exodus et al or MovieBox or Terrarium TV and so on. To those who now consider unrooting because of Netflix: Just don't - use other services instead. Richard Markert So when everybody takes your advice and uses a service that doesn't compensate anybody in the content creation business, and all the high-quality media is gone, don't go crying about there being nothing good to steal anymore, k? Railwayman Even better: DRM and proprietary vendor lock in are scrapped and replaced by standards. If they want some kind of protection - make it device wide and linked to the account signed in so playback works in different apps - only thing needed is to call the system wide authentication system. I am against DRM and vendor restrictions. Original content without any of the BS is what the world need. Piracy is a symptom of several problematic things such as geo restrictions, root restrictions and the failed idea of the "right of no distribution" - i.e. the content exist but stubborn companies deny distribution using silly arguments. I always remove DRM from purchased content in order to have full control including the basic right of using whatever app or equipment for playback. Richard Markert Start developing the solution, and start a content creation company that can compete with the big boys when it comes to quality content. Or, you can sit around and whine online about the content creators not wanting the people who don't follow rules to play in their gated sandbox and get mad when you crawl over the fence. Railwayman I take that you like DRM and proprietary vendor lock-in. It is easy to avoid the gated sandbox so no need to whine. It is easier to just fire up Exodus rather than relocking the bootloader and flashing a stock ROM or remove SuperSU in favor of Magisk just to be able to get Netflix. DRM is such a waste of time. It's not necessary to develop a new service since the content are available DRM free already. Standards for media and books etc does exist or did you miss EPUB, PDF, AAC, MP3, MP4 and so on? Perhaps you prefer such a format as ZNO or Apple modified EPUB that only works with iBooks? saf1927 Magisk seems to do the trick. Helios What about my non-rooted OnePlus One? It's also listed as incompatible.. '-_- 天地人 Don't OnePlus devices run a custom ROM and have unlocked bootloaders? Android Developer How can they block people who root the device from installing the app? The play store doesn't have this filter. Maybe after the install they do this check? Richard Markert If you're really an Android Developer, you would know that SafetyNet is what's doing this "behind the scenes". Android Developer I'm talking about the article. They say that Netflix blocks rooted devices, and I know that this isn't an option on the developer console. Google doesn't have anything related to rooted devices there. Ezio I have about 200 original blu-ray disks, go to cinema, and I'm Netflix subscriber. Now I won't get app updates (or even worse I won't be able to use it in the future) just because I like to use my custom rom. Thank you. This is really a bad move. AdjustedFlow I thought netflix was about providing a better service than piracy. Now they're literally pushing me back to piracy. What the heck? Dany If for "root" they mean administrator privileges, don't we already have that on windows 10? So why Netflix doesn't block desktop version too? P.S. by the way...whatever man! I was using Kodi more than this crap anyway... Miku is Best Vocaloid This means Netflix won't be getting my business anymore. Paul Sterling No worries here, when you're legit. Take my money, I'm not cheap. Give me a service, I'll pay you. I don't need to rob. What am I? 13 living with my mom using Napster? Naw, grew up. Don't have any Tim foil hats. My wallet grew up too. ast00 This is a dick move that could have been avoided. If they want us to pirate their content instead, we will pirate their content. We tried doing it the legal way, but they didn't allow it. Their problem, not ours. EowynCarter Umf. **checks google play ** No longer compatible with my nexus 6 . But nexus 4 still ok. For crying out loud! I'm not rooted or using a custom ROM. Pyramid Power netflix is just losing money. it's saying to those people, 'go to thepiratebay!' RemiV2 I guess I'll just keep torrenting then. Thanks, Netflix.

Netflix is a client app. If I can, with a rooted phone, fake my subscription, or somehow cause a major security issue, that is not a problem with me, that is a problem with you pushing out a vulnerable app to millions of users. Sure, it would be my fault for exploiting it, but there is no-one but you who managed to put the problem in place. A CLIENT app should not be anything but a front-end representation of an API run by your servers. The CLIENT should have nothing but a CLIENT ID to use with the API. The CLIENT should NOT be able to change JACK SHIT with the API, it should only be able to get search results, get access to encrypted streams, etc. If your client CAN change JACK SHIT (which one could assume is true, since you are so actively hiding your code) then you have a major security vulnerability... This is a problem with your code, not anyone's rooted device... Hell, you don't even need a rooted device to access the applications code, just download an APK of the app, extract it, and decompile it... Jesus netflix, get your shit straight you bendy pos... My1 I think their problem is rather that rooted users *might* be able to capture the decrypted stream using root or whatever and they are afraid of that. although on PC you have admin permissions and netflix has no problems iirc. Linus Monie Yeah, exactly, its not like people will prefer to pirate the stream on their phone (at least I wouldn't...), so that was my first thought of why they made this change. Now that I think about it though, its probably not so much of a Netflix decision as it is a licensing issue with one of their "film sources". (can't think of a better word for it rn..) Licensing issues are a bitch when you need to adapt to as many as Netflix has... BahnStormer Netflix is used more on tablets and TV boxes, these tend to be used for several years longer than phones and even Google now only updates their devices for <2 years (Samsung / streamer manufacturer's do this even less!)... We HAVE to run the likes of Lineage if we want the devices to be secure! Bye bye Netflix, even Amazon Video lets us use rooted devices! jcopernicus People don't understand IP and lambast a company protecting it. Of course. My1 I have never tried but if netflix can run over a non-HDCP connection like DVI or VGA, there's literally no reason to use a phone for piracy. RemixedCat well they got rid of 5 star ratings, deleted tons of shows I was in the middle of, and the roku app is hella slow and takes 10 freakin minutes to load (by comparison my OS install from power on to desktop was 8 minutes on my samsung 850 500GB SSD!!) Tobi I'm running LineageOS on my Oneplus One to lengthen the lifespan of my device. Why must I be punished for that? I'm going back to pirating content. StankyChikin Possible that the movie industry is pushing this? SkullOne Shhhhh. Don't use logic here. It's not allowed. It's simply easier to blame Netflix and believe that they have a vendetta against the teeny tiny, itsy bitsy amount of root users out there! StankyChikin Forgive me plz lol username_not_valid This isnt about Netflix, its about its content providers. There is this notion that you can copy files and therefore pirate content if you are rooted. We all know its rubbish, Netflix probably knows its rubbish, but that doesn't change anything. If Netflix wants shows, its has to abide by its license agreements. There is really nothing Netflix, Amazon, Sky or any other streaming service can do about it. The fact that almost all pirate content comes from PCs and HDCP by-pass devices doesnt mean a thing. TedPhillips at least in practice, unlocking your bootloader/being rooted has no impact on your widevine support level. now, i'm not sure if the oem could supply a high-level drm library on a pre-rooted device, due to agreements, but modification after the point of sale is a different matter. meanwhile, keep on streaming netflix on your 'rooted' computer - gasp!~ Richard Markert >meanwhile, keep on streaming netflix on your 'rooted' computer - gasp!~ I don't even need an admin account to steal Netflix on my PC. Since the Windows 10 app and browsers BOTH work over analog, all I need is an inline box with a DSUB VGA connector and simply capture the entire output from the VGA port. My1 or use DVI if possible, even better. Valerie Frye-Preter Did they do this because of the stolen season 5 of Orange is the New Black? TedPhillips wasn't that stolen before it was available for streaming? so i don't see how it could be. TedPhillips when the device can be retroactively uncertified, as safetynet mutates over time, that's a step beyond the usual forced obsolescence of artificially short software support windows. now instead of buying a new phone every 18-24 months, it could be literally whenever they feel like moving the goalposts. Mike Hunt I don't understand. I am a Netflix subscriber, but will probably have to unsubscribe now since I bought a rooted Chinese mediabox for my TV. This sucks, as I liked and supported NetFlix's business model. Richard Markert Which box do you have?

Ajmobileguru First DirecTV Now and now Netflix. I dont see the point. As if rooted users were pirating the streams or movies. Rooted users on non-nexus/pixel devices already were getting only 480p because of widewine crap and now this. Anunnaki This is why people switch to apps like Popcorn Time and Terrarium TV. Biga173rd Popcorn time still works? Anunnaki When I last checked few months ago, it was working. No idea about the current situation though. Biga173rd Okay Erin Andrews Oh that's easy, they block my device I cancel my subscription. Say goodbye to my 15 dollars a month. piggynuts Stopped playing Pokemon, stopped using Snapchat, next to go is Netflix. I refuse to say bye to root. BobButtons Magisk.

Fedup Let's see... Piracy: $0.00, no ads, no DRM, no device/location/time restrictions Legit: $$$, ads out the as$, DRM limiting options, shows locked to specific devices, locations, etc. Keep on making the decision easier for us, Netflix. xyz Fortunately, the Pirate Bay is accessible from all devices and regions without any geo-blocking. berserksgangr Well, my Nexus 7 with Lineage it's not working even without root (error 9) Nick Riley This is utterly stupid! Corvus Dove Remember that time that making things more difficult for software and media pirates through DRM while possibly messing with legitimate customers paid off and prevented piracy? Me either. Asbjørn The problem here is that most users root their phone to get the updates that their OEM doesn't want to make available. If Android had proper updates, rooting would not be so necessary. Patel Nisha Root user here. How do I use Magisk for this? I have it installed and new to the Magisk(haven't had a rooted phone in a while)? Keletor Does it stop you from sideloading it?

DDS This move will not stop people from pirating their content, it will encourage it. Exactly the opposite of what they're trying to achieve. But tell that to the a**hats who control the money... Ubelsteiner And thus, Plex and Kodi become even more popular, as Netflix drives a nail into it's own coffin.

Features Reviews Phones Android iPhone Windows Phone Apps Computers Laptops Lenovo Tablets Windows Tutorials Events More Audio Crowfunding Design/Concepts Gadgets Gaming General Photo/Video Web Ubergizmo in French Ubergizmo in German Ubergizmo in Italian Ubergizmo in Spanish Could Google WiFi Be Getting A Camera Upgrade? By Tyler Lee on 05/16/2017 19:08 PDT Back in 2016, Google launched the Google WiFi which is a hockey puck-shaped device that allows users to create a mesh network in their home for better WiFi coverage. However could Google have bigger plans for the WiFi device than being a mere WiFi extender? According to a recent sighting on Google’s website, it could be. Spotted by the folks at Phandroid, the Google WiFi Product Overview page has revealed a rather interesting addition to its specs in the form of a camera as you can see in the screenshot above. It has been speculated that maybe it could be a typo, but it is a rather huge typo since this is an entirely different feature that you might not expect from a WiFi device. An alternate theory is that Google is planning on giving the WiFi an upgrade by introducing a camera, thus allowing it to be turned into a home security device as well. Given that the idea of the WiFi is to be placed around various parts of the home, this effectively allows users to setup multiple cameras at the same time. However given that Google already owns Nest which has their own lineup of indoor and outdoor cameras, it would be a bit strange for Google to try and compete with themselves. In any case we’ll wait for confirmation to see if this is really a typo or an actual thing which could be revealed at Google I/O which kicks off this week. Filed in Gadgets >Rumors.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Wednesday, 17 May 2017 | MYT 9:00 AM Empowering indie game developers with blockchain technology by lee kah leng Von Nostitz with his studio's first game "Send 'em to Hell", where users can exchange the in-game points into XEM cryptocurrency. — ART CHEN/The Star Xhai Studios co-founder and president Otto Von Nostitz wants to revolutionise the way we consume and pay for apps and in-game content, by providing an alternative to the Google Play Store and Apple App Store duopoly.  The Malaysian-born Canadian has set up a new distribution platform called Xarcade. According to Von Nostitz, Xarcade allows game and apps developers and publishers to keep a bigger share of the profits as it only takes a 1% to 2% cut of the sales price, compared to Google and Apple, that take as much as 30%. He added that the publishers could then opt to charge gamers less.  The payment method for the games also differs from the Google Play Store and Apple App Store. It does not require credit or debit cards or telco billings for purchases made.  All transactions on Xarcade involve proprietary XAR points that can be exchanged with a cryptocurrency, called XEM, that is backed by the NEM Foundation. This cryptocurrency can be purchased from exchanges like Poloniex and Bittrex.  You can also purchase the cryptocurrency using your PayPal account. "Gamers will also be able to make in-game purchases and be able to convert game points (tokens) into Xarcade’s credits called, XAR." said Von Nostitz. The cryptocurrency uses a public blockchain technology, where an open, distributed ledger records every transaction done in a permanent and verifiable way. That means that transactions between two parties will be recorded on the public ledger. The authenticity of each transaction is authenticated by digital signatures and at the same time, each transaction is checked against each other on the network. “Blockchaining games provides the advantage of bypassing the middlemen (app stores) to create a direct relationship with the game publisher and gamer,” said Von Nostitz. Similar to most app stores, a Xarcade user will be able to view and download games on the platform, with additional features from the integration of blockchain technology, such as purchasing and exchanging in-game tokens. Von Nostitz claims that similar to other cryptocurrencies, XEM can be converted into real money. The platform is still in development and will be fully up and running by Q4 this year.  To date, the startup has also published an Android game called Send ‘em to Hell, a modified version of the classic endless runner game genre commonly found on mobile. The game can be downloaded for free on the Google Play Store. Users can also link the game to the NEM Wallet app (also available on Android) to manage their in-game purchases with XEM. In the game, players will take control of avatars of lookalike world leaders such as Donald Trump, Kim Jong-un and PewDiePie, the world’s most successful YouTuber. The characters will then be subjected to a free fall “down a hole to hell” and have to avoid as many obstacles as possible to achieve the best high score possible. According to Von Nostitz, there are currently two more new games in the pipeline from the startup, which currently has four full time employees based in Cyberjaya. Von Nostitz said that Xhai Studios’ adoption of XEM will open it up to more cryptocurrency users, whom he believes a large majority are avid gamers as well.   Related Stories You May Be Interested Russia’s Yandex sees no negative impact from Ukraine sanctions The evolution of mobile phones Coway promotes a healthy lifestyle A sex scandal amid the jailing of ex-governor Ahok When the CEO is your mentor 10 after work habits for personal success Others Also Read Food to satisfy all tastebuds June 15 hearing for Govt, PM's application to strike out suit Honouring the woman who loves us unconditionally advertisement Latest News China’s Lenovo announces restructuring to focus on consumer Facebook adds Snapchat-like camera filters to Instagram Ukraine accuses Russia of attack on president’s website after web sanctions UN has high hopes for private sector after Microsoft rights donation Pikom says its members are not affected by WannaCry Most Viewed in Tech The mobile phones of back then vs smartphones of today Pikom says its members are not affected by WannaCry Cyberattack eases, hacking group threatens to sell code HP Enterprise unveils computer ‘for era of Big Data’ Starbucks software glitch takes some stores offline Facebook to reimburse some advertisers after discovering bug New WannaCry variant surfaces UN has high hopes for private sector after Microsoft rights donation Hackers mint crypto-currency with technique in global ransomware attack Club Med's big on digital technologies Powered by advertisement advertisement site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Lifestyle Tech Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services Magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs Advertising View Our Rate Card Policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu StarProperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com Search The Star Online Connect with us Content Partner Our Radio Stations site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Tech Lifestyle Travel Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs advertising View Our Rate Card policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu starproperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com social media Facebook Twitter Copyright © 1995- Star Media Group Berhad (ROC 10894D)

Google rumored to announce standalone VR headset at I/O 2017 Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/05/16 5:13pm PDTMay 16, 2017 27 Plus 1 on G+ 34 Share on Facebook 44 Share on Twitter Total Shares105 News At last year's I/O, Google dipped its toe into the virtual reality waters by announcing Daydream (above). Like Gear VR before it, Daydream requires a phone to be inserted into a headset to operate. However, Variety is reporting that Google is set to unveil a VR headset that is completely standalone—no phone required. It's not clear what software this device would run, but Android seems like a good choice. Google already has lots of Android VR components ready to go. Google also has all the Project Tango technology to draw on. That may figure into a tracking technology that would set Google's new VR project apart. The real defining feature of this alleged headset will be so-called "inside-out tracking." That means the headset will be aware of your location in space without any external hardware, so setup is vastly easier. This is something being perused by several VR firms, including HTC and Oculus/Facebook. Even if Google shows this device off, don't expect it to be available any time soon. Daydream was announced at I/O and the Daydream View didn't come out until late that year. Source: Variety Tags daydream io2017 VR subscribe ...

Leon Yep, the future is a headset and a fleshlight. We're all doomed. whispy_snippet Hmmm you might be right. But I think VR has quite a bit more potential for compelling experiences if it's done really well. 3D kinda hit a ceiling in terms of what it could offer whereas VR starts above this ceiling entirely. OligarchyAmbulance The typical response of someone who hasn't tried it. Bruce Wayne Yeah, that must be it. I've never tried it. 🙄 Ryan I tried it, sold off the headset part after a few months. Its a fun toy but I dont play a lot of games on my phone and the VR content was limited enough that it just wasnt worth putting it on. Someday it might be there to compete with console gaming, but right now no. Zach Mauch Have you tried one of the high end desktop units like the Vive. It is a completely different experience. I ended up selling mine as well, but just because I wanted to while the price was still high. I know I will be purchasing more. Zach Mauch Totally disagree. How much have you used it? Have you tried an HTC Vive? The experience is definitely going to be huge and mainstream, but it will take a while to get there. This type of unit (standalone headset without external sensors) is where things are going and may actually be the first unit able to break out into the mainstream just like the iPhone did for smartphones. Too early to tell though. 4Ui812 No phone required .....but hand and video are a must. Google is slowly realizing the full potential of VR :-) The only potential. whispy_snippet I'm interested. Lare2 When is Google going to focus it's effort behind one product vision and push it hard. So now we will end up with cardboard sets. The VR one with the little control and now this new standalone one. Is Google replicating the mess it created with messaging apps in this space also. Geez Google. It appears as if you just hit puberty and are confused. Zach Mauch It is all building toward the end goal. They are stepping stones not fragmentation like the messaging fiasco. This will likely build on Daydream. Maybe Daydream 2.0. Fully compatible will all 1st gen while allowing for new 2nd gen capability. TechGuy22 With no games or apps in sight. No oem support. I'm sure it will sell millions. Nexus✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I don't want a stand alone vr headset, I want a google glass that doesn't suck. If snapchat can loosely get away with it, I should have a [face mounted] camera and heads up display for notifications, that simple. Nick Cannon Dying for AR here Grey Users: "We want news on Hangouts Meet and Hangouts Chat coming to everyone!" Google: "We hear you. Here's a VR headset after we failed to support VR after our last announcement." Alex Louderback Meanwhile, the Daydream platform is thriving and rich with content... But sure, they failed to support it. Ryan Its almost as popular as two of the android wear lines combined. I wouldnt be so quick to call it a success. Grey This is what denial looks like. Leroy Filon https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/35aa16784615bb53461bdeb316472b702338523767b50358559d2189e168ec43.jpg Ryan Cool, what 5 people were waiting for! Steven Dumeng It is absolutely worth noting that Google bought VR gaming developer Owlchemy (they made PS4 game Job Simulator) Zach Mauch Since we are so close, I'm actually rooting against leaks. I would like to be surprised. Rod Do people actually care about VR? Not a single friend of mine used their Gear VR for more than 1 month after the purchase. whispy_snippet Probably because mobile VR still sucks. In fact even VR connected to a super powerful PC still has limitations. But it won't always be this way. Lars Jeppesen I use my Gear VR every day to watch tv shows YuCMi I'll be very interested if Google increases the FOV, resolves screendoor effect, and makes it wireless. bass-ackwards Done Kwetsima Maluleke It'll flop.

The headlining feature for this build is the Google Assistant SDK, which is made possible with support for the Raspberry Pi-based Voice Kit. There's also new hardware support for the NXP i.MX7D, "which supports higher performance than the i.MX6UL while still using a low power System on Module (SoM) design." There is also support for new drivers, and the Inter-IC Sound Bus has been added to the Peripheral I/O API, which should allow for users to write audio drivers. Google is also releasing a hardware sample, the Edison Candle. This is to be the first in a series of production samples, which showcase the company's new OS working together with the hardware. As you might expect from a Developer Preview build, there are also a number of known issues to be aware of. You can find Google's full release notes here, and they include the notes from previous builds.

gizmodo Deadspin Fusion Gizmodo Jalopnik Jezebel Kotaku Lifehacker The Root Video Sploid Paleofuture io9 Science Reviews Field Guide Microsoft's Apps Problem Has Never Been More Dire Alex CranzSaturday 12:57pm Filed to: Microsoft Build 2017 Build Microsoft Windows 10 Windows Store Windows 10 S 223 10 Edit Promote Share to Kinja Toggle Conversation tools Go to permalink Images: Alex Cranz/Gizmodo At Microsoft’s Build conference, the dorkiest of companies put on a big show, complete with fog machines and fancy lights, in order to show it’s a cool competitor to Apple and Google. The speakers who came on stage during keynotes had stylish hair. “Do they have dressers backstage?” an attendee asked a group of us when it was all over. Advertisement Build exists to get developers excited. The biggest devs blow upwards of $2000 for a three-day pass to the event, where they have unlimited drinks, plentiful meals, and access to Microsoft’s best and brightest. Part of Microsoft’s wooing process involves appearing “hip” to a group of developers who resemble the cast of Silicon Valley in all the worst ways. Hence the light show and Microsoft EVP Terry Myerson’s questionable hoodie and leather vest combo. It wants these devs so amped that they’ll rush back to their MacBook Airs and Surface Books to crank out brilliant software, hopefully for Microsoft’s Windows Store, which has just one third of the apps of much cooler stores from Google and Apple. With the arrival of Windows 10 S, which can only use apps from the Windows Store, the app marketplace has never been more important than today. Yet time after time over the course of the event, Microsoft dropped the ball on its pitch to developers in favor of niche distractions. Apple’s a monolith of money and users, and thanks to Android and Chrome OS, Google is right there with it. Both have OS platforms with heavily used app stores. They’ve built customer bases of hungry fans that enthusiastically embrace their hardware and software products, and consequently, developers want to build apps that work with Apple and Google platforms. Microsoft, on the other hand, can’t seem to ditch the buttoned-up association it’s developed for making the work computer you don’t want to use. Its reputation is seemingly forever cemented by those old Mac vs PC commercials. Attempts to rewrite the script have been met with mixed success. On the hardware side, Microsoft has become a genuine player in the field of coveted kit. The Surface Pro and Studio are ambitious devices that are legitimately exciting. The Surface Laptop announced earlier this month is one of the most interesting products announced so far this year. But Microsoft’s software landscape is still dorktown and one of the big ways Microsoft’s attempting to undorkify things is by leaning into the Windows Store. There’s a problem though. Microsoft’s app store in uncommonly small compared to the other guys. According to Microsoft, in 2015 there were just 669,000 apps available. (The company hasn’t officially updated that number since.) According to Statista Apple and Google both have more than three times that number of apps available in their stores. Advertisement Advertisement The number of available apps alone doesn’t necessarily dictate the quality of someone’s computing experience, but it remains a common metric for success, and if Microsoft wants to look cooler in the software space, it needs a big awesome app store full of big awesome apps. Microsoft stunned the audience of Build when it announced iTunes was coming to the store just a week after announcing Spotify’s arrival. Those are two hugely important apps, and you could feel the energy in the keynote after the announcement. Developers and press looked at one another, baffled and delighted. An Apple app would appear in the Windows Store! Then Microsoft immediately squandered that excitement. The rest of the focus both on stage and later in the “Hub,” the primary showroom for the conference, wasn’t on the cool apps traditional users might want, but on the deeply nerdy niche stuff. Sponsored During the keynote itself, Microsoft glossed over the lifestyle apps to focus on Autodesk and Linux. Autodesk was up on stage to announce that Autodesk Stingray was headed to the store. Stingray is an engine used to build things in 3D and is almost exclusively used by 3D artists and engineers. After that announcement, Microsoft followed up with the news that Linux was coming to the store. If you’re excited about the Linux distributions Ubuntu, Suse, and Fedora arriving to the Windows Store, know you’re uncommon. It’s big news for developers, but meaningless to people who would normally seek out apps on an app store in the first place. Site of the Build keynote. There are lots of blue lights and...fog? Given Microsoft’s enthusiasm for the store, it was weird that the company’s newly announced operating system, Windows 10 S, which can only get apps through the store, was mostly absent from the conference, apart from a few mentions during the keynote. You couldn’t find it anywhere on the show floor, where developers mingle with Microsoft personnel. Nerd city. The Store booth had a lone TV screen with a rep standing in front of it—and that rep had not been briefed on Windows 10 S. In fact, it seemed no one had. Every Microsoft rep I asked seemed bewildered by Windows 10 S questions. They could say it was “exciting” but they had no spiel ready for why it was exciting, nor why the Store was crucial to its success. Advertisement And no one could explain what, fundamentally, might have changed about the Windows Store to make it an appealing avenue for app launches after a five years of sluggish adoption. Even app developers that were bullish about the platform were frustratingly vague about what was different now compared to when the Store launched in 2012, and why Windows 10 S would not go the way of its failed store-focused predecessors Windows RT and Windows 8.1 with Bing. Christoph Teschner and Michael Simmons were positively giddy about Windows 10 S when I sat down with them in a high-rise hotel near the conference. Both men are employees of Algoriddim, and were in Seattle because their app, DJay Pro, had just received the App Creator of the Year award. “I think that’s the future,” Simmons said of the Windows App store. Advertisement Teschner pointed to his own youth, growing up with Apple’s app stores for Mac and iOS and how it had prepared him for the Windows Store. “People are used to app stores now,” he said. “It felt sort of natural to me when I first got my Windows Store.” Though they were reluctant to give exact numbers or concrete evidence of a successful Windows Store launch, Simmons said “Windows fulfilled our expectations.” He praised the development process in particular. “Seeing developer tools ten years ago, it’s a total leap today. It’s an evolution and we’re in the middle of it.” Neither man could give a concrete reason for why they felt Windows 10 S had a chance to succeed when its predecessors failed so badly, but sitting in a room and soaking up their optimism it was hard not to be swayed a little. Advertisement Advertisement And it’s that kind of optimism for app developers that Microsoft will need if it hopes to actually fill the Store with cool apps. If those men had been on the show floor, showing off their app and talking up their own experiences with developing for the store, Build might have actually projected the image Microsoft desperately needs. But Microsoft is still figuring it out. It has ditched the pocket protector, but it’s still not cool. Recommended Stories What Is Microsoft's Grand Plan for Phones?

Segment fees paid by airlines, age of the technology and how long it takes to get anything new done are all popular reasons for GDS bashing. However, at an airline event last week, the bashing was reserved for Google Flight Search, which is ringing alarm bells for some in the travel industry for the strength it is gathering. It’s a subject close to the heart of CarTrawler’s technology chief Bobby Healy who first laid out his concerns here about a year ago. In short, Healy feels GFS is “very bad” for the airline industry (and travel in general), airline.com and future distribution. He sees the roll out of the service enables Google to extend its reach to the top of the trip planning funnel – i.e where consumers go first to start planning a trip. And, Healy thinks airlines need to evaluate GFS in a different way to other potential threats because of Google’s power and the data it has on consumers and their purchase intent. He says that “in good times” a GDS makes about $3 per booking, an airline makes about $21 but currently, according to Healy, Google is making $16 per online airline booking. “It’s growing every year, widening and deepening as they take more of the travel funnel.” It’s not about cost Healy was speaking at the CAPA conference in Dublin last week but said it’s actually not about cost but about “the loss of control.” He likens Google to a “blender” because it attracts more and more users with its products and ecosystem and gathers more information, data and insight on them. “They have more access to you customers then you’ll ever have, more insight into your customers, more data. It knows your customers location, it knows absolutely everything about your customer. “It has an engineering capability like nothing we’ve ever seen and produce products quicker than anyone else. “Airlines willingly give Google their pricing data and inventory in real time sub 10 response times. That key item is the problem here as you have created the perfect storm for intermediation of your own customer base.” What to do? Airlines can push back GFS on this by only giving up their data on their own terms. This is something Healy believes both American Airlines and Ryanair are doing. And, provide the sort of value Google is providing, via better mobile products, for example. Or, wait for the regulators to catch up. Those solutions seem weak as pointed out by CNN journalist Richard Quest who was moderating the CAPA session and says it’s like “trying to hold back the tide.” He questions whether it’s possible for the airline to be in control and own the customer with the number of distribution channels out there and ongoing disruption. But, ultimately control lies with the customer as Travelport global head of product and marketing Ian Heywood stresses. “That’s where it should reside but it’s about what is put in front of the customer. Is the airline going to be able to do that or is someone else going to do it for them?” Heywood says a more collaborative approach is the way forward so that airlines can improve how products and services are shown to consumers and it is no longer all about price. He adds that airlines need to take steps along an API path to move forward generally. “Everyone talks about disruption, that’s the reason no one has moved anywhere. Airlines have been waiting for a big disruption rather than working with the industry to plan evolution.” Steps to IATA NDC Heywood says airlines need to start using a combination of existing ATPCo technology and API to ensure their content is being distributed via various channels. “Once you have those steps in progress then arilines can see how they can get more content into the API path.” He stresses that it’s going to take a lot of time and will require investment in both API technology and a merchandising platform. “ATPCO works well and is really efficient so we’ve got to make sure new technology and processes are as effective and as efficient.” Heywood adds that carriers will also need to “reengineer the human process” to get buy in from everyone. The last word So, taking into consideration slim margins, 40 years of technology and the complex fare structure – can it be done? Healy says airlines really need to focus on what the problem is. SAP general manager and global head of travel & transportation Paul Pessutti adds that the airline industry needs to invest in areas such as data science. For Heywood, although the industry is only a “minute way along the path” – the technology is there and the standard is there so it’s just about bringing it all together.

Perhaps the $16 is commensurate for the value added by the capabilities/data/funnel of Google that airlines don’t have (and will probably never have). However, I do agree that airlines may be working themselves into a corner by embracing Google. I would also like to know where the $16 number comes from. I suspect he is confusing revenue and profit. Reply 12 hrs ago   Ian R Clayton Well GDS is pretty outdated and it time for modern technology and up to date systems to replace it. I am not happy that is Google. It is being very disruptive to travel companies now, from hotels to activities and all the steps from planning to purchase. Its power is unrelenting and it looks poised to close down all the small companies who provide services to travels and hotels. We do not want a single company dominating the entire landscape! Reply 15 hrs ago   Henry Harteveldt ATPCO may “work” well but it is as relevant as a DC-6 in today’s airline world. Airlines are, as the should be, intent on pursuing dynamic pricing, which means less reliance on pre-filed fares and, in turn, ATPCO.

So when rumor broke out that Google is making yet another VR headset, there wasn’t really much of a surprise. This headset, however, could turn the VR market on its head. If the rumors are true, the headset that Google will supposedly unveil at Google I/O this week would be one of the most advanced equipment in hat market. And it won’t even need a smartphone. Google already has a VR platform. In fact, it had two. The first was Cardboard, which made VR into a DIY project. This was followed by the current Daydream VR that shed its hobbyist persona for something a bit more streamlined and commercialized. Both, however, have one thing in common: they need a smartphone to function. In contrast, the new VR headset, which may still come under the Daydream project, will be able to function by itself, much like the HTC Vive, Oculus Rift, and PlayStation VR. It will, however, differentiate itself with a feature that none of those have yet. This standalone headset will supposedly be able to track the user’s position and movement without the use of external trackers set up around the room. Google calls this “inside-out” tracking and its origins could perhaps be traced back to Project Tango, which is now also part of the broader Daydream team. Tango utilizes a variety of sensors, including cameras, IR, and gyros to indicate the device’s position in 3D and real-world space That information, however, has mostly been used in the service of augmented reality rather than VR. As interesting as this new headset might sound, the hardware is always only part of the story. A VR platform will live and die by the content available for it. In that regard, Google has been laying the groundwork for bigger and more sophisticated VR experiences, with the acquisitions of Tiltbrush and, more recently, Job Simulator game creators Owlchemy Labs. Then again, like any Google project, like Google Glass, Project Ara, Project Titan, and more, this new VR headset could indeed be revealed, only to be scrapped years from now. Join us as we cover Google I/O this week to divine what Google might have in mind in the VR space.

Google rumored to announce standalone VR headset at I/O 2017 Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/05/16 5:13pm PDTMay 16, 2017 27 Plus 1 on G+ 34 Share on Facebook 44 Share on Twitter Total Shares105 News At last year's I/O, Google dipped its toe into the virtual reality waters by announcing Daydream (above). Like Gear VR before it, Daydream requires a phone to be inserted into a headset to operate. However, Variety is reporting that Google is set to unveil a VR headset that is completely standalone—no phone required. It's not clear what software this device would run, but Android seems like a good choice. Google already has lots of Android VR components ready to go. Google also has all the Project Tango technology to draw on. That may figure into a tracking technology that would set Google's new VR project apart. The real defining feature of this alleged headset will be so-called "inside-out tracking." That means the headset will be aware of your location in space without any external hardware, so setup is vastly easier. This is something being perused by several VR firms, including HTC and Oculus/Facebook. Even if Google shows this device off, don't expect it to be available any time soon. Daydream was announced at I/O and the Daydream View didn't come out until late that year. Source: Variety Tags daydream io2017 VR subscribe ...

Leon Yep, the future is a headset and a fleshlight. We're all doomed. whispy_snippet Hmmm you might be right. But I think VR has quite a bit more potential for compelling experiences if it's done really well. 3D kinda hit a ceiling in terms of what it could offer whereas VR starts above this ceiling entirely. OligarchyAmbulance The typical response of someone who hasn't tried it. Bruce Wayne Yeah, that must be it. I've never tried it. 🙄 Ryan I tried it, sold off the headset part after a few months. Its a fun toy but I dont play a lot of games on my phone and the VR content was limited enough that it just wasnt worth putting it on. Someday it might be there to compete with console gaming, but right now no. Zach Mauch Have you tried one of the high end desktop units like the Vive. It is a completely different experience. I ended up selling mine as well, but just because I wanted to while the price was still high. I know I will be purchasing more. Zach Mauch Totally disagree. How much have you used it? Have you tried an HTC Vive? The experience is definitely going to be huge and mainstream, but it will take a while to get there. This type of unit (standalone headset without external sensors) is where things are going and may actually be the first unit able to break out into the mainstream just like the iPhone did for smartphones. Too early to tell though. 4Ui812 No phone required .....but hand and video are a must. Google is slowly realizing the full potential of VR :-) The only potential. whispy_snippet I'm interested. Lare2 When is Google going to focus it's effort behind one product vision and push it hard. So now we will end up with cardboard sets. The VR one with the little control and now this new standalone one. Is Google replicating the mess it created with messaging apps in this space also. Geez Google. It appears as if you just hit puberty and are confused. Zach Mauch It is all building toward the end goal. They are stepping stones not fragmentation like the messaging fiasco. This will likely build on Daydream. Maybe Daydream 2.0. Fully compatible will all 1st gen while allowing for new 2nd gen capability. TechGuy22 With no games or apps in sight. No oem support. I'm sure it will sell millions. Nexus✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I don't want a stand alone vr headset, I want a google glass that doesn't suck. If snapchat can loosely get away with it, I should have a [face mounted] camera and heads up display for notifications, that simple. Nick Cannon Dying for AR here Grey Users: "We want news on Hangouts Meet and Hangouts Chat coming to everyone!" Google: "We hear you. Here's a VR headset after we failed to support VR after our last announcement." Alex Louderback Meanwhile, the Daydream platform is thriving and rich with content... But sure, they failed to support it. Ryan Its almost as popular as two of the android wear lines combined. I wouldnt be so quick to call it a success. Grey This is what denial looks like.

Steven Dumeng It is absolutely worth noting that Google bought VR gaming developer Owlchemy (they made PS4 game Job Simulator) Zach Mauch Since we are so close, I'm actually rooting against leaks. I would like to be surprised. Rod Do people actually care about VR? Not a single friend of mine used their Gear VR for more than 1 month after the purchase. whispy_snippet Probably because mobile VR still sucks. In fact even VR connected to a super powerful PC still has limitations. But it won't always be this way. Lars Jeppesen I use my Gear VR every day to watch tv shows YuCMi I'll be very interested if Google increases the FOV, resolves screendoor effect, and makes it wireless. bass-ackwards Done Kwetsima Maluleke It'll flop.

The key to solving complex computing challenges isn't always to simply throw more processing power at the problem but instead to actually change the way computers think about the problem. That's where neural networks come into play, attempting to mimic the steps which the human brain uses to solve problems, rather than simply relying on statistical analysis and data crunching. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link Google Translate aims to be your personal translator as you travel the world. Photo: Adam Turner In late 2015, Google's TensorFlow neural network machine learning team decided to apply the technology to the Google Translate service, which had already been operating for 10 years using phrase-based machine learning based on statistical analysis. Only 13 months later Google revealed that it was using neural networks to overhaul its Word Lens feature, allowing it to support both Simplified Chinese and the more complex Traditional Chinese when you point your smartphone's camera at a sign to translate the text in real time. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link The improvements in Google Translate after the shift from phrased-based machine learning to neural networks, compared to human translations. Photo: Adam Turner Lend me your ears Today 26 Google Translate languages are underpinned by neural network machine learning, offering a significant performance boost compared to the old phrase-based system. The improvement in Chinese/English translations over the last year was a greater leap than the progress made by automated translation tools in the last 10 years, says Google machine learning research scientist Mike Schuster. Advertisement Translations of most Asian languages have seen a similar improvement thanks to neural networks. Rather than being taught by humans, Google Translate teaches itself by scouring the web for translated texts to analyse, a bit like the Rosetta stone which helped decipher hieroglyphics because it contained the same text translated into Demotic script and Ancient Greek.  As a result the accuracy of Google Translate's efforts today is less related to the complexity of the languages involved and more to do with the availability of online translations to study and their accuracy. Just like a person, Google Translate can pick up bad habits if it's trained on poor translations. Google rates the accuracy of its translations based on user feedback, with a score out of six. The results vary from language to language but in the graph above you can see the improvement based on old phrase-based machine learning and how close neural networks are coming to matching human translations. According to Google Translate user ratings, these days neural network French to English translations are considered almost as good as your average human translation and while Chinese lags behind you can see the significant improvement thanks to the introduction of neural networks. At the same time Google has also improved the speed of translations thanks to enhanced algorithms and new hardware. A 10-word sentence previously took 10 seconds to translate but now it's down to .2 seconds even though Google Translate handles more than 1 billion translations each day with 500 million active users across 103 languages. The people have spoken Google eventually plans to shift all 103 languages to neural network translations, but a separate neural network model is required to translate each language to each other language – which would require more than 10,000 models to handle 103 languages. The next big step for Google is to build multilingual models capable of translating to and from several languages. Google's first multilingual model is based on English, Korean and Japanese, designed to translate either Asian language to and from English but not between the two Asian languages. Despite this, it also allows for "zero shot" translations between Japanese and Korean -- which means translating between two languages even though the model isn't specifically trained to support that combination of languages. It's one of the first zero shot translational efforts to offer intelligible results, Schuster says, although the results aren't yet as good as using a neural network model trained specifically to translate from Japanese to Korean. While Schuster won't be drawn on a time frame, he says it's only a matter of time before neural network machine language translations are better than the average human translation. Google is also looking at the way that sentences with the same meaning can be mapped to similar regions of a language's structural map, in another step towards the holy grail of building a universal translator. It will remain the stuff of science fiction for the foreseeable future, but at this rate neural network machine learning is looking like the best shot for translating every language in the world into your native tongue. Adam Turner travelled to the Google I/O conference in California as a guest of Google.

With Google I/O kicking off tomorrow, a new web page tucked deep inside the official Google WiFi landing page has us scratching our heads. At first glace, it’s just a detailed list of Google WiFi’s hardware, with the inclusion of an odd spec not actually found on the current version of the wireless router: an 8MP camera. Now, it could very well be a simple typo (we imagine it most likely is), but the odd hardware spec really got us thinking. What if Google was planning to update Google WiFi’s hardware with some sort of security monitoring webcam? It doesn’t sound too far fetched, not considering Google WiFi is aimed at expanding coverage of your home’s wireless network by placing satellite routers in several rooms of your home to create a wireless networking mesh. Adding a camera to the hardware for home security purposes could be a logical evolution of the hardware, even if it’s just a separate, more expensive model giving consumers a little more choice. It wasn’t too long ago Google bought Dropcam for $555 million and while that’s being operated as a separate entity under the Alphabet’s umbrella, it’s possible some of Dropcam’s knowledge could have aided in the creation of such a product. With Google I/O kicking off tomorrow, anything is possible. If nothing else, add it to the list of far fetched things we’d love to see announced. We’ve already reached out to Google for comment and will update this post if or when we receive it.

Set to be displayed at the Google I/O developer conference later this week, the Audi Q8 sport concept features a new infotainment system which includes Google's popular Android operating system. This enables the car to offer several new functions including Spotify, Google Play Music, and Google Assistant. Besides the new features, the infotainment system allows information to be displayed on both the Audi virtual cockpit and the MMI touchscreen display on the dashboard. The company says this "marks the first time the new services have been fully integrated into Audi’s brand specific infotainment system." The navigation system will continue to use HERE Maps, because Audi partially owns the company, but users will also be able to navigate using Google Maps. The system will also come with a new message and call center. Audi is particularly excited about using Android as it offers "tremendous potential" as thousands of developers are already familiar with the platform. The company is also promising shorter update cycles and a "significantly greater diversity of services as well as broad international availability."

International Business Times UK UK World Business Politics Fintech Technology Science Sport Entertainment Opinion Video Pictures Log out Newsletter Signup Smartphones Cybersecurity Innovation Social Media Games Motoring Technology Companies London hospital acted 'inappropriately' for sharing 1.6m records with Google's AI firm The Royal Free Hospital in Hampstead was working on an app with the tech giant. By Tareq Haddad Updated May 17, 2017 02:00 BST Close NHS cyberattack: What you need to know Reuters A London hospital has acted outside the legal guidelines after it shared 1.6 million patient records with Google's artificial intelligence company DeepMind Health, the UK's National Data Guardian (NDG) has said. The Royal Free Hospital in Hampstead started sharing the data with the private company in 2015 to develop an app called Streams that could diagnose acute kidney injuries. It argued that it did not need patients' consent to share the data – as under common law, consent is "implied" when "direct care" is provided. However, the NDG has disagreed with that basis. In a letter to Stephen Powis, the Royal Free Hospital's medical director, which was leaked to Sky News, the NDG's Dame Fiona Caldicott said: "It is my view that the purpose for the transfer of 1.6m identifiable patient records to Google DeepMind was for the testing of the Streams application, and not for the provision of direct care to patients. "Given that Streams was going through testing and therefore could not be relied up for patient care, any role the application might have played in supporting the provision of direct care would have been limited and secondary to the purpose of the data transfer. "My considered opinion therefore remains that it would not have been within the reasonable expectation of patients that their records would have been shared for this purpose." Google and the Royal Free Hospital defended the deal, stating that it has had a tangible impact on patient care and that the data was not used for commercial gain. A spokesman for Deep Mind said: "Nurses and doctors have told us that Streams is already speeding up urgent care at the Royal Free and saving hours every day. The data used to provide the app has always been strictly controlled by the Royal Free and has never been used for commercial purposes." A spokesman for Royal Free London said: "The app was built in close collaboration with clinicians to help prevent unnecessary deaths by alerting them to patients in need in a matter of seconds." The NDG acknowledged the health benefits, but still concluded that the deal lacked the "appropriate legal basis".

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Eugene Volokh By Eugene Volokh May 16 at 8:42 PM Follow @volokhc The Sanford Herald‘s Zachary Horner reports (links mine): A complaint was filed with Google Sunday morning under the name of Sherry Womack, a Lee County Board of Education member, seeking to remove search results related to her 2011 arrest. The request asked Google to remove URLs linking to The Herald’s April 14 story “Womack addresses 2011 arrest” and four separate URLs from the website The Rant, including two stories, her mugshot and the original arrest report. The articles detail Womack’s 2011 arrest for breaking and entering and her response. The complaint can be found on the Lumen Database (lumendatabase.org), a collection of requests to remove materials from websites. The request cites a court order “to destroy all records” of the case. Sunday’s complaint also links to a copy of the Petition and Order of Expunction for the charge, listed as a misdemeanor breaking and entering that took place on May 7, 2011. … The process is called “de-indexing,” in which websites or individual pages are removed from Google’s search index. The optimal result for those seeking a de-indexing is that the links cannot be found by a Google search. What was requested under Womack’s name is not illegal. Google Support indicates that sites can be removed from its index and search results “if (Google) believes it is obligated to do so by law, if the sites do not meet Google’s quality guidelines, or for other reasons, such as if sites detract from users’ ability to locate relevant information.” [But w]hen it comes to instances like Womack’s, which is a libel claim and is a newspaper, not much usually happens…. Multiple voicemails left for Womack were unreturned by press time Tuesday. Womack is also the wife of Jim Womack, a North Carolina politician who is running for chairman of the state Republican Party. My view: People shouldn’t be trying to secretly vanish stories about elected officials, behind the backs of voters and reporters, to hide from voters factually accurate information — however unfair and obsolete they may think it to be. And voters should be informed when people try to do this (even if this attempt was likely doomed to failure, since Google apparently doesn’t actually deindex stories based on American expungement orders). UPDATE: I originally stated that Womack had attempted to get the material deindexed, because the request was submitted under her name, because she would have been the obvious beneficiary of the removal, and because her lawyer had earlier demanded that the newspaper “cease and desist from publishing any story about Ms. Womack that makes any mention or innuendo that she has ever had any involvement with law enforcement in Buncombe County” (i.e., the very materials that the deindexing request was aimed at). But on reflection (after the post was up for 15 minutes) I realized that I should refrain from drawing that inference, and I changed the title and a few parts of the text to focus on what I know — that someone (using her name) had asked for the material about her to be deindexed.

The letter obtained by Sky News was sent to the medical director of the Royal Free NHS Trust in London on 20 February. The data sharing agreement between the trust and DeepMind was first revealed by a New Scientist investigation last year. Google’s AI firm originally obtained the NHS patient records to test a smartphone app called Streams that could help monitor people with kidney disease. A quarter of acute kidney deaths are preventable if caught early, so DeepMind wanted to use its algorithms to try to spot early signs of the disease. If successful the app would save lives. However, UK regulations specify that unless explicit consent is given by patients, their data can only be shared for the purposes of “direct care”. But Caldicott concluded that DeepMind instead used the data “for the testing of the Streams application, and not for the provision of direct care to patients”. Advertisement Caldicott’s assessment is damning, as the National Data Guardian is the leading body on protecting patient data. She has recently submitted evidence to the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO), which is investigating whether the data transfer between the Royal Free NHS Trust and DeepMind was appropriate under the Data Protection Act. Consent needed? The report from the ICO is expected soon and, if it sticks to Caldicott’s assessment, will side with New Scientist’s original conclusions that despite the huge potential benefits of DeepMind’s technology to patient care, consent was not obtained when it should have been. “DeepMind obtained 1.6 million patient records, the vast majority of whom have no kidney condition,” says Phil Booth at MedConfidential, an organisation that campaigns for health data privacy. “Why do they have data for the whole hospital population and how could that ever have been considered direct care? These are questions that must be asked.” The ICO has the power to issue a fine of up to £500,000 for breaches in data protection law, which in this case would work out at just 30p per patient. It could also issue an enforcement notice requiring DeepMind to delete or stop using the data. “That’s not to say the things that DeepMind want to do couldn’t be ethical, lawful, consensual and transparent,” says Booth. “But at the moment they are failing on every condition.” In a statement, a spokesperson for DeepMind says that the company recognises the need for more public engagement and discussion about new technology in the NHS. “We want to become one of the most transparent companies working in NHS IT.” More on these topics: Google medicine United Kingdom Advertisement Download Buy In Print Subscribe Advertisement Sign up to our newsletter Enter your email address to get started Contact us FAQ About us Who’s who Advertise with us Advertise jobs with us Privacy and terms Write for us Science jobs Dating Shop RSS feeds Syndication information Events Travel The Collection Subscribe Account settings Gift subscriptions Student subscriptions Educational subscriptions Corporate subscriptions © Copyright New Scientist Ltd.

Google is building full-on Android for the car with Volvo and Audi Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/05/15 9:33am PDTMay 15, 2017 17 Plus 1 on G+ 102 Share on Facebook 57 Share on Twitter Total Shares176 Android Auto Android OS Google News Today Google has revealed more info on their new standalone Android platform for cars. Unlike Android Auto, which just casts info from your phone onto whatever software your vehicle maker has tossed together, the new system is based on Android and brings some of the same tools Android Auto had natively. Google revealed this initiative at last year's I/O, but there hasn't been much news apart from Chrysler's concept back at CES. Both Audi and Volvo will be making use of the new systems in future vehicles. Both Volvo and Audi appear to have been given a lot of leeway with the UI in the screenshots on Google's blog, things look to be skinned pretty heavily. If Google is allowing car makers that degree of flexibility, I wouldn't expect too much in the way of material design love when it lands in more cars. Even so, more tools and features from Android making their way into your car could come in handy, OEM-skin or not. Not to mention the utility of having some of the same features you did before via Auto without needing your phone around. Google revealed last year that they were thinking about the potential of bringing full Android to cars and showed off a prototype Maserati modified to run the experimental software at last year's I/O (Maserati was not involved, Google and Qualcomm shoehorned the tech into a car on their own). Google has been quiet since then about any news related to the new initiative, or any new names for the program.

JD In one of the security updates it'll stop my Exhaust from exhausting outside and instead in to the cabin. Don't worry tho it goes away after a reboot and doesn't affect all models. George Google's motto: let's abandon an OS/app/service before it becomes too popular by starting from scratch with another OS/app/service... TechGuy22 LOL you're going to have a ball at this year I/0 since so many shit going to be announced that will get killed off after 6 months George bro, it's been like that EVERY year... get wit the program lol makapav It really took form last year. Spaces, Allo, Duo. That was a whole bucket list. Dennis Ulijn I have a feeling Spaces was made just because they needed some centralized message board idea for I/O. Just in time for I/O and google never looked back... Months later when another app was coming out with the Spaces name they found out it was still alive. Drakenoid Spaces was pretty good, though now we've moved to Classroom and pretty sure it won't get shuttered because schools. Ryne Hager I gotta say this here, since I can't elsewhere. But, I used to think you were just a entertaining mild troll, but given your comments elsewhere I have come to see that you are the entertaining mild troll we need. Keep it up. Kawshik Ahmed At least in this Android never had a official 'Standalone In-Vehicle Infotainment' like QNX and Tizen. There are some unofficial attemps like Hyundai uses Android 2.3 and Honda uses Android4.2 in their car IVI. But this will much safer because Google is working with them. Shining Wing So what happens when the car stops receiving updates? One of the main reasons for Auto using your phone was that you only needed to worry about your phone and app being up-to-date, and phones are a lot more replaceable than cars when the updates stop. Kawshik Ahmed Do you know Hyundai Sonata cars run on Android 2.3 !!!!!! and Honda cars run on Android 4.2 ?? People don't panic about this cars because they don't know they are running Android and not just any Android very very old version of Android but those cars are all fine. Specialized OS's don't need updates. Aaron Anything that connects to the internet needs to be updated, at least for security purposes. And these systems will have to be connected at some level for Maps updates and messages. instinct Yes, people don't care because that's the norm. However, if in 2027 you are running a car with a ten year old OS and someone else is running a current OS, people may start to care. The big problem I see right now is that Android Auto now doesn't really seem to have any aftermarket products with really good screens. xyz "Specialized OS's don't need updates." Ha ha ha ha ha! Ryne Hager That is an excellent question. I hope we get more info at I/O. syxbit When I bought my last TV, I deliberately got one without Android TV, because of the pathetic updates. I just purchased a Shield. I'm happy to buy a new Shield TV every 2-3 years, but I'm expecting my TV to last 5+ years. This is exactly what I'll do with my next car purchase. I'd rather the car just support the old Android Auto, so I can keep getting new phones every 1-2 years. I will never purchase a car with Android built in unless there's a clear promise of updates for MANY years. Ryne Hager I very much agree. Wait till you see my "What we use" post. I have a feeling you're gonna love it. marcusmarcus2 How often are the infotainment systems in cars updated now? If "Project Treble" comes into fruition, then it could actually improve infotainment system updates compared to current ones. Sean Leckie XDA? :) Suyash Bansal Maybe they could use the new update mechanism they are talking about Android O which makes it easier for manufacturers to update device. h4rr4r That will never get updated. The car should just display the phone screen. Jon Fridman I was going to buy a Volvo XC60 later this year, hopefully AA integration will work better than some other cars. It won't be the new version like they're working on, but at least it'll be there. Alexey Vasilyev I have Volvo XC60 MY14 running Sensus Connected Touch (Android 2.3). UI is very fluid. But I got a lot of problems. First Volvo want 400 EUR per year to keep iGO maps updated. I made a root and installed Waze - it works very good. But 3 years have passed (not a lot for cars) and now some features are not working. For example Liveradio app (which is just a list of radio URLs) is not working anymore - server shutdown. I think the best way for such systems is to use Mirrorlink. At least you can keep apps updated. JD Wooo Now I gotta get a new car every 2 years Rawhi Mohammad Thats if your car doesn't get stuck in BSOD mode #RIP6P Bru [971] That's funny. Audi was reticent to add Android Auto support to it's cars Deeco "Car has unexpectedly stopped working" Ra1nb0wD4sh DE Process 'hydraulics' in 'brake sys' isn't responding. Do you want to close it? icyhotmike I bought a headunit with Dual bluetooth pairing, HD, Spotify, I Heart Radio, Pandora, every damn app.. built into it... for $99 (Kenwood KMM-BT318U) It even has an "Android" mode (no idea what it does) So don't waste your money Volvo and Audi Suyash Bansal That's not Android Auto. It's Android Open Accessory protocol (AOA) that lets you control phone-based content icyhotmike I got android auto app on my phone. Suyash Bansal Yes. I've also done the same. :) marcusmarcus2 This would hav ebeen good news a couple years ago when I was hoping for my Nexus Lexus...Pixel ruined that dream. boop Auto may be the only extension of Android that Google's handled well. By making it an app it's not dependent on either the car or the phone for updates, you don't even need to buy a new car or head unit as you can just run it on your phone and, working under the assumption that this is built on O with Treble, updating the car itself shouldn't even be an issue (unlike all the Android TVs stuck on Marshmallow and the Watches still waiting on Wear 2.0). Paul Lemelin Harley needs to go in this direction and I don't care if it's an Android or iOS solution because their Harmon Kardon Infotainment system is the absolute WORST! Shahin iPhone users be like, "will it also come with lag, malware and inconsistent updates?" Suyash Bansal At least it'll work better compared to Apple's Carplay 😂 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeESbGPl_Dw Harsh patil Does this mean a slow death to Android Auto from now until such OS is lanuched? JG Tesla should be involved with this. They already have a big tablet installed front and center. And, from what I heard, Tesla had approached Google in regards to potentially using Android for their system. Google informed them Android wasn't, then, ready to be used in cars. But obviously now... It would allow Tesla to quickly add more apps available. Then you could use any music streaming service, without having to wait for Tesla to build the app for their platform. steelew NOOOOOOOO! Please don't abandon android auto!!!!!! Rawhi Mohammad I LOVE THIS.. but as we know.. its eventually going to end up unmaintained. The only way to make sure it lasts is if we build ourselves. And I can't believe no one has made something like this for their cars yet. How hard is it to connect a few tablets in sync to a car's OBD while bluetooth paired to a phone running a client app. I know its easier enough then done, but theoretically, its makes sense.

Video by Robert Hanashiro Google CEO Sundar Pichai (Photo: Jefferson Graham, USA TODAY) 130 CONNECTTWEET 6 LINKEDIN 8 COMMENTEMAILMORE MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. — When Google made a major foray into hardware last year with new smartphones, a voice-activated speaker,  a virtual-reality headset and a WiFi router, it was an audacious play to complement its software arsenal and extend its reach into the consumer market. The company best known for its search engine wasn't kidding around: It made hardware the centerpiece of its Google I/O developers conference here and later poached Amazon executive David Foster, who ran the lab responsible for Amazon's Kindle tablet and Echo smart speaker, to head hardware product development. Google CEO Sundar Pichai has referred to hardware as "our next big bet." A year later, Google has discovered that hardware can be, well, hard. As Google gets ready to lay out its vision at this year's I/O Wednesday, it's still making that hardware bet pay off. Pixel phones are in short supply and relatively few have sold. Virtual reality isn't yet ready for prime time, as evidenced by modest sales of Google's Daydream VR headsets. The Home speaker has sold well, but has been dwarfed by Amazon Echo. Foster, the prized recruit brought to kick-start the division, left in April after six months on the job. Hardware is hard because Google's success, in large part, is dependent on others. It's sourcing components, managing inventory and distribution, making supply-chain deals, crafting relationships with cellular carriers, and more. It's also investing plenty of money into marketing, making this a risky financial and operational gambit for Google. Albeit early in Google's grand hardware experiment, the company lags in key markets. Jan Dawson, who runs Jackdaw Research, estimates shipments of 600,000 to 700,000 Pixels in the fourth quarter last year, and probably half that amount in the first quarter of 2017. (Apple, by comparison, shipped 50.8 million iPhones in the first quarter.) Google Home, with 23.8% of the U.S. market for voice-enabled speakers this year, is far behind Amazon Echo's 70.6%, according to eMarketer.

"Hardware is a tough business and can be quickly commoditized," says Tuong Nguyen, an analyst at market researcher Gartner. "But the end game is not to compete with Samsung and Apple on shipments. It is to show (Google) services through devices." Google does not specifically break out revenue figures for hardware, but Pichai hinted it contributed to a 43% increase in "other revenues" to $3 billion during Alphabet's quarterly financial report last month. The company, when asked to comment, says it's "thrilled" with the reception of its hardware. "We’re committed to building hardware for the long term as a great way to bring a beautiful, seamless Google experience to people," Google said in an emailed statement. "The early signs are promising, and you can expect to see us expand our offerings thoughtfully." Google Home has a skills gap.  (Photo: Google) 'Made by Google' One of the most frequently cited quotes in technology is computer scientist Alan Kay’s advice that “people who are really serious about software should make their own hardware." Steve Jobs even referenced Kay when introducing the first iPhone, which tightly weaves Apple software and hardware to control the Apple user's experience end to end. Last year, Google tore that page from Apple's playbook, staking its claim as its own hardware brand with the introduction of the Google Home speaker, the Daydream virtual reality headset, a WiFi router and an updated Chromecast video streaming stick. In October, it unveiled the Google Pixel. This week when Google again gathers thousands of software developers in Mountain View, Calif., it's expected to continue its big push into the hardware business. Google's gambit, with the catchy phrase "Made by Google," creates its own portfolio of consumer devices in the mode of an Apple or Amazon, to ensure consumers always have access to its web services and, hence advertising. The goal is to create "a personal Google for each and every user," Pichai said last year. It's risky on several levels: besides the cost of manufacturing, marketing and customer service, it risks alienating its own Android partners, with which its Pixel phones and other deices now compete. But even if the Home and Pixel don't fly out the shelves, Google may still count the 'Made by Google' play as a success — if the devices pressure its partners, such as Samsung and LG Electronics, to come out with their own groundbreaking hardware based on Android. And that's the ultimate goal, say analysts:  entice users to stay in the Google ecosystem, a network of services and devices linked by its Google Assistant artificial intelligence. Google's camera takes advantage of some nifty software trickery to make it the fastest smartphone camera on the market today.  (Photo: Reviewed.com / Michael Desjardin) "I  never believed that Google's position in hardware was designed to be a huge revenue maker," says Creative Strategies analyst Tim Bajarin said. "I don't ever see Google as a hardware company. I see them as a company that creates hardware to try to get their OEMs to push the envelope." It is a strategy fixated more on retaining Google's loyal users within its computing ecosystem than overtaking market leaders in various hardware categories, say analysts. "Pixel is more about showcasing Google services on one phone than it is about competing on a large scale with Samsung Galaxy S8 and iPhone," says Holger Mueller, principal analyst at Constellation Research. Sonny Chatrath, director of sales of a travel management company and a Bollywood actor from Freehold, N.J., is a loyal Google customer.  (Photo: AFTAB) Some of these loyal users say this plan is working working. "I wanted one from the day it was announced," Clifton Thomas, a 38-year-old graphic designer from Clifton Forge, Va., says of the Google Pixel. Thomas said Google’s own devices were always attractive because they received operating system and security devices before other Android devices. But the Pixel was special because it was expressly built to show off Google's latest services and artificial intelligence, says Thomas, who uses the Chrome browser, Android Auto in his car, and Google Play Music as his streaming service. And the Pixel is his primary camera, too, which he uses to take pictures and video of his 9-month-old daughter. When Sonny Chatrath, director of sales of a travel management company and a Bollywood actor from Freehold, N.J., decided to give up his Gionee S7, a Chinese phone which he bought in India while shooting a film, he almost bought the new Samsung Galaxy S8+, lured by a buy-one-get-one-free promotion. But this self-described "Google guy" says he couldn't resist buying the Pixel instead. He says he wanted to have a phone no else does."I am a fan of everything Google, therefore the choice was not difficult," says Chatrath, who describes himself as a devout Android user.

Thanks, Google Waze 15 Business US judges say you can Google Google, but you can't google Google The Chocolate Factory is spared the aspirin treatment by the 9th District Court 16 May 2017 at 23:52, Shaun Nichols Google has won the rights to keep its name a proper trademark after a US court found its search engine is not quite ubiquitous enough to be considered a generic term. The three-judge panel in the US Ninth District Court of Appeals found that the Mountain View advertising giant can keep the trademark it holds on "Google," throwing out a challenge of the trademark as generic. Plaintiff David Elliot had challenged Google's right to the trademark, arguing that the prevalence of the term "google" as a verb for making a search query means the company name is no longer eligible for a trademark, as it is a generic term. Such genericized trademark rules have been applied in the past for terms like "aspirin," "thermos," and "videotape" – which were once proper trademarks but have since been invalidated as they became generic terms. In the case of Google, the panel decided that while many people commonly refer to searching something online as "Googling," they can still be referring to Google the search engine itself. "We conclude that Elliott's proposed inquiry is fundamentally flawed for two reasons. First, Elliott fails to recognize that a claim of genericide must always relate to a particular type of good or service," the judges write in their decision [PDF]. "Second, he erroneously assumes that verb use automatically constitutes generic use." The court goes on to reason, in its opinion, that many people might use the term "google" to refer to a blanket search and still have the proper Google in mind. In other words, someone planning to "google" something can be reasonably expected to search it on Google rather than, say, Microsoft Bing. In one particularly amusing passage, the court cites a verse by rapper T‑Pain using the phrase "google my name." "Without further evidence regarding T‑Pain's inner thought process, we cannot tell whether he is using 'google' in a discriminate or indiscriminate sense," the court reasons. With the decision in hand, Google will be able to continue to claim its own name as a trademark, and we will all still "Google" things on Google. ® Tips and corrections 15 Comments MORE Google Legal Trademarks Courts Sign up to our Newsletter Get IT in your inbox daily Subscribe More from The Register Google court filing names a second source for Uber's lifted robo-car plans And that's not all: a redaction slip identifies Lior Ron as Levandowski's co-accused 5 Comments It's been a few days, so what fresh trouble has Uber got into now?

Internally, the headset’s specifications will be comparable to other high-end VR headsets. Notably, the headset is designed to be a standalone device and won’t need to be paired with a smartphone or desktop PC to run. Read: Google, Ubisoft And Others Announce 4 Daydream VR Games At GDC 2017 As Variety notes, the headset also is expected to feature inside-out positional tracking that would allow users to move around a virtual space in the headset without needing external sensors like those used with the HTC Vive. Similar technology has been a centerpiece in upcoming headsets from Microsoft and it’s the latest area on which VR companies want to focus. While the high-end headset has reportedly been in the works since early 2016, the scope of its potential unveiling is still up in the air. As Variety notes, Google could either provide a limited preview for the headset or choose to keep its unveiling under wraps for a future event. Google I/O will be in held in San Francisco from Wednesday through Friday. The high-end Google VR headset will operate alongside Google’s Daydream VR, which it unveiled during last year’s Google I/O. Like Samsung’s competing Gear VR, the Daydream is a basic headset that offers a basic step up in performance for mobile VR applications and videos. Both headsets are intended to be paired with smartphones and feature controllers that offer basic functionality and control for applications and games. Additionally, the high-end Google headset could be a potential way for the company to tie together its various VR acquisitions in the past year. For Google, its new VR headset likely wouldn’t be hamstrung by the performance ceiling or practical restrictions of a smartphone or desktop computer.

On the apps side, Google has picked up individual developers including the Tilt Brush team, the creator behind the VR music creator SoundStage and studio Owlchemy Labs. As a developer, Owlchemy was among Google’s most notable acquisitions — the studio was responsible for flagship VR title Job Simulator and recently released Rick and Morty: Virtual Rick-ality , a VR title based on the animated series “Rick and Morty.” In addition, Google also helped launch the Yi Halo, a high-end video rig featuring 17 4K-caliber cameras that’s used to shoot VR video. Google also launched the Jump Start program, which is intended to get the Yi Halo into the hands of directors and other creatives in order to produce high-definition VR content.

Performing online searches for health information - colloquially known as using "Dr Google" - leads to a better mutual understanding of symptoms and diagnosis between a patient and their GP, a new research paper found. Searching online before an appointment can generally have a "positive contribution" to a GP consultation, a team of researchers from Belgium found. More than half of patients had more confidence in their GP after searching online Credit: Alamy It has been suggested that as many as two thirds of patients search the internet prior to a consultation. But previous studies have found that some doctors ignore or contradict the information patients bring to the consultation because they feel "threatened and that their professional expertise had been disregarded", the authors of the latest research wrote. The new study, published in the British Journal of General Practice, saw experts assess the impact of using "Dr Google" to look up health conditions and ailments before patients visited their GP. They gathered information on 718 Flemish patients aged 18 to 75. More than half of patients had more confidence in their GP after searching online. But two thirds said they did not feel reassured by their internet search. And three in 10 said they felt worried after the search. Researchers found that the more frequently people consulted the internet for specific complaints, the more likely they reported reassurance. They concluded: "The large majority of the Flemish population would still visit the doctor after online information retrieval and the patient's confidence in their GP is rarely affected. "On the contrary, it may lead to a better mutual understanding of symptoms and diagnosis. "Therefore, an open attitude toward the patient and their online search behaviour is recommended. "GPs often overestimate the possible anxiety caused by an online information search. "In conclusion, at a time in which shared decision making and patient empowerment is the norm for conducting good medical practice, Dr Google has a generally positive contribution to the GP consultation and the doctor-patient relationship."

Nintendo Switch Variety describes the headset as featuring “cutting-edge” technology, with inside-out tracking being the primary one. Unlike the Oculus Rift, HTC Vive, and PlayStation VR, Google’s headset could forego external cameras and other sensors in order to track a user’s movements. Without the extra hardware, VR could be greatly simplified for users. According to the report, the preview might still be scrapped, if not very limited in scope. A consumer release would be far off in the future, with the announcement at I/O aimed at likely giving developers time to create optimized apps for the new device. Additionally, the report makes references to power consumption issues and getting inside-out tracking to work in all environments. Leading up to the announcement of Daydream at last year’s I/O, Google was already rumored to be working on a standalone headset. Later rumors hinted at a mixed reality focus, with a device “that blurs the line between virtual reality and augmented reality.” If Google does not go through with the announcement, Variety notes that the company could just end up focussing on the current Daydream platform. Google is hosting a separate session at I/O on Thursday morning that is dedicated to both virtual and augmented reality. Abner Li @technacity Is interested in the minutiae of Google and Alphabet.

What do you want to see Google announce tomorrow? UAG Samsung Galaxy S8 Cases Unlike the past several I/O’s, we really don’t have that many ideas as to what Google might be unveiling at this year’s developer conference. The one rumor that has been floating around is one that involves Google creating a standalone VR headset. Unlike Daydream which uses a phone as the computer and display, and unlike high-end VR units like the Vive or Oculus Rift, Google’s headset is rumored to have inside-out tracking. Basically, instead of having sensors placed around the room, this headset would have built-in technology that could scan and track a room in real-time.

Little has been revealed about the new OS since it first came to light last year. However, new details surfaced last week, first reported by Ars Technica, and have been making the rounds. Fuchsia apparently will move Google away from its long association with Linux, according to Ars, as it is based on a new microkernel called "Magenta." Google plans to dump not only the Linux kernel, but also the General Public License, one of the most popular licenses in the free and open source software universe. The default user interface for Fuchsia, called "Armadillo," is based on the mobile app Flutter's software development kit and split into two separate apps -- Armadillo and Armadillo user shell, according documentation posted on GitHub. The Fuchsia team reportedly includes Travis Geiselbrecht, who worked on the Danger Hiptop smartphone, NewOS, Jawbone, BeOS and other projects; and Brian Swetland, who worked on Danger and BeOS. Both previously worked on Android as well. Legal Concerns Google's rationale for Fuchsia may be related in part to an epic US$9 billion legal battle between Google and Oracle, suggested William Stofega, program director for mobile phones at IDC. "As the Oracle case revolves around the copyright of Oracle APIs used in Android, it could be a contributing factor in Google's decision to build another platform," Stofega told LinuxInsider. While Google emerged victorious in a ruling last year, the case has sent a chill through the open source community. It's conceivable that Google decided to move further away from the use of Linux to avoid future legal challenges. It's also possible that Google simply recognizes the need to move to an OS that works better across multiple platforms. "There's been a lot of discussion, as it relates to going from TV to smartphones and Chromebook," Stofega said. "At the end of the day, as the world has changed and not necessarily become PC-centric but just mobile centric, maybe some of the things that brought it to fruition in terms of the Linux-based OS can no longer be part and parcel of the new world," he remarked. Acceptance Issues Linux never got mass market traction on certain types of devices -- ranging from tablets to mobile phones and thin clients -- for two main reasons, noted Paul Teich, principal analyst at Tirias Research. "Linux is not focused on enforcing hard performance metrics as an underpinning for reliable, robust software application performance," he told LinuxInsider. "Linux uses preemptive multithreading, where Fuchsia seems to be coded for hard, real-time task scheduling." Fuchsia is being designed to make sure the thread scheduler can enforce quality of service for individual tasks and services, Teich said, which will come in handy to ensure the best streaming-media experiences or a great augmented reality experience. The second main issue is that the Linux community did not have a user experience in mind and could not agree on a single, unified user experience as it matured. "Linux started out, like Unix, as a command line language," Teich noted. "Over the years, it has accreted services to support UX functions, but those are add-ons." Fuchsia may still be a command line interface, but it's clearly being designed with all of the integrated services needed to support a modern UX, Teich said. "Google may be building a real-time OS that spans small connected things to large connected data centers," he surmised -- "one code base that can be pared back if the UX isn't needed, but also scales to varying U.S. requirements." The development of the new OS is driven in part by security concerns that potentially could cost Google billions of dollars if they aren't brought under control, said Rob Enderle, principal analyst at the Enderle Group. "They want to better control both the quality and timing of updates to their OS," he told LinuxInsider, "and while Linux got them to market quicker, they now feel complete control is far more important."

Photo/Google Google Street View published naked images of two naked children playing outside their house, leaving their mother horrified. Laura Haslam, 27, was outraged after finding out daughters Brooke, four, and Eva, three, were snapped by internet giant Google Maps outside their fenced-off home in Poulton-Le-Fylde, Lancashire, according to Daily Mail. The youngster's faces were blurred in the images - but their naked bodies could clearly be seen using the website's 'street view' option as users trawl along the street. Haslam said: "It's quite scary scared because I don't know how many people might have seen it. "I don't know how long it's been there for, but it looks like it was taken last summer. "It was a hot day and I put the paddling pool out at the front of the house because that's where the sun is - but I certainly won't be doing that again." Laura, a business student at Blackpool and The Fylde College, made the alarming discovery last week after being alerted to it by a neighbour. She reported the image, which was taken in 2016, to Google and contacted the police, who also contacted Google about having the image removed. Continued below.

Haslam said: "I couldn't believe it when a neighbour knocked on the door and said 'you need to look on Google maps because your kids are naked on the internet'. "I honestly thought nothing of it and thought he was winding me up - but then I was just so shocked to see it. "I mean, they had their faces blurred out but it was enough for a paedophile to get a kick out of it." Haslam, who is engaged to Jordan Senior, 33, said she has kept the original image just in case if she becomes involved in legal action. Their naked bodies could clearly be seen using the website's 'street view' option as users trawl along the street. Photo/Google Mother-of-two Haslam said: "I know I would never win taking on the likes of Google and their army of lawyers - but something needs to be done. "I know they automatically blur faces, but surely they should scan the area for naked bodies - any pervert could have looked at my kids on there. "Why is it acceptable to show their bodies and not their faces? "The images have been totally smudged now but I don't know why they didn't do that in the first place." She added: "Like, if I was sunbathing topless in the garden, I wouldn't, but let's just say I did, and that image of me got out - I would be devastated." Haslam told the Knott End and Preesall Pre-School where her children are pupils about the incident and the nursery has posted warnings to parents. A Lancashire Police spokesman said: "A request was sent to Google to remove the image of the children. The complainant was also advised to send a request." A Google spokesman said: "Google takes a number of steps to protect the privacy of individuals when images are published to Street View. "We automatically blur sensitive information like faces and vehicle licence plates and in this case although the faces were already blurred, we applied additional blurring to the image when requested." - Daily Mail By Paddy Dinham Email Print Get the news delivered straight to your inbox Receive the day’s news, sport and entertainment in our daily email newsletter SIGN UP NOW Loading Discover more Loading Loading Herald Services Book your ad Driven Photos for sale True Commercial Death Notices Public Notices Our Regional News Stories The Northern Advocate Walter Ngaau arrested in Tinopai Walter Ngaau arrested in Tinopai Hawke's Bay Today Teacher and pupils reach for the stars It's a stellar year for a teacher and two star pupils Bay of Plenty Times Big read: Life dedicated to reconnecting with the disconnected Tommy Wilson is "chief imagination officer," of social service Te Tuinga Whanau Our Features' Top Stories Driven Buy an icon: luscious Martini Porsche comes with a bonus Iconic Porsche racer to go under the hammer at Bonhams Spa auction...

Developer Preview 4 of Android Things OS is now available Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/05/16 11:57am PDTMay 16, 2017 15 Plus 1 on G+ 40 Share on Facebook 53 Share on Twitter Total Shares108 Android Things Google News Google officially released Android Things OS last year as a developer preview. If you're not familiar with it, the OS is a lightweight version of Android that maintains support for popular Android developer tools and APIs, like Android Studio and Google Play Services. The developer preview has received a few updates since then, with the last one adding support for the Google Assistant SDK. Now the fourth major version of the Developer preview has been released by Google. The most important new feature is support for the NXP i.MX7D Pico development platform. Connecting to digital audio devices over Inter-IC sound (I2S) now works as well. The Google Assistant SDK first arrived in Developer Preview 3.1 for the Raspberry Pi Voice Kit, but with Preview 4, the SDK should now work on all development boards. Finally, developers can now register additional interfaces with PioDriverManager. Being a developer preview, there are still many known problems, including Google Play Services slowdowns and system power management being completely disabled. Still, if you want to give it a try, you can find more information at the source link below and download the images here.

Paul thanks for your honesty rivasdiaz I would say that Android Things will be more under Google's control. They seem to imply updates will come directly from Google for all devices. That would be a huge selling point for Android Things. The news about Google creating a standardized interface between vendor and Android OS is also a significant step towards less friction in upgrades. At least they are aware of the problem and are moving in the right direction. Capt4chris This OS seems to be taking quite a while to progress. Suicide_Note Well, then, get to work on it.

While WWDC has been a software-only event in recent years, it appears that might change with this year’s keynote and Siri Speaker. With Siri Speaker rumored to be unveiled next month, it’s time to take a step back and look at everything we’ve heard about the device at this point… Spigen TEKA RA200 Airpods Earhooks Cover Apple’s efforts to build a standalone Siri hardware device were first reported back in May 2016. The device at the time was said to be marketed as a high-end alternative to the Google Home and Amazon Echo. Like with most rumors, expectations and details regarding the Siri Speaker have changed as time has progressed. For instance, it was at one point reported that the Apple TV would be the center point of Siri Speaker, but more recent reports have pegged the device as a truly standalone hardware product. Report: Apple planning Siri SDK for WWDC as it builds Amazon Echo/Google Home hardware competitor Report: Apple TV could be home for rumored Amazon Echo-like Siri speaker All in all, up until recently not much was known about Siri Speaker. It was essentially just a long-standing rumor without any details backing it up, but that changed early this year as more information started to emerge. A Bloomberg report last September arguably kick-started the focus on Siri Speaker. The report claimed that Apple was in the process of testing the device in employee homes after following a two-year research and development period. Bloomberg also shot down those rumors of the Siri Speaker being baked into the Apple TV. Apple’s rumored Siri-powered Amazon Echo competitor now in prototype testing – Bloomberg Report: Apple’s rumored Amazon Echo-like Siri speaker may feature facial recognition cameras Jump forward to 2017, Twitter leaker Sonny Dickson last month took to the social media platform to reveal a handful of details about Siri Speaker. Dickson stated that the Siri Speaker will offer some form of Beats technology underneath the hood, while also noting that it will run a variant of iOS. In terms of design, he pointed to a meld between the Mac Pro and UE Boom as a good example of Apple’s design. While Dickson’s report was met with skepticism at the start, it was quickly corroborated by reliable Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo of KGI Securities. Kuo noted in an investor report that Siri Speaker will be positioned as a “high-end Amazon Echo competitor,” with one of its biggest selling points being “excellent” sound quality. The analyst explained that Siri Speaker will feature seven tweeters and a subwoofer, though it’s still unclear if there will be any user-facing Beats branding. Rumor: ‘Siri Speaker’ Amazon Echo competitor could see WWDC debut with Mac Pro style KGI: Apple likely to announce ‘home AI’ Siri Speaker at WWDC, positioned as high-end Amazon Echo competitor One big question many have about Siri Speaker, however, is whether or not the device will feature a display. While some reports have said it’s uncertain whether or not they’ll be any sort of user interface, others have been more clear. Just this weekend, KGI’s Ming-Chi Kuo released another industry note in which he reiterated much of what he had already said, but also noted that Siri Speaker will include a “touch panel.” At this point, it’s not explicitly clear what the “touch panel” will offer. It could be similar to the Echo Show, which offers a full touchscreen, or it could be something smaller, perhaps similar to that of the MacBook Pro Touch Bar. Apple exec Phil Schiller himself came out against the idea of voice-only virtual assistants, so it really doesn’t come as too big of a surprise that Apple’s offering will incorporate some sort of display. Referring to the Amazon Echo and Google home, Schiller said: Well, I won’t talk to either one specifically, [I] don’t want to. My mother used to have a saying that if you don’t have something nice to say, say nothing at all. Obviously one hugely important aspect of the Siri Speaker is going to be Siri itself. Arguably, the success of the hardware product depends almost entirely on the improvements Apple brings for Siri. It’s no secret that Apple’s virtual assistant has started to lag behind Amazon’s Alexa and others, but KGI claims that Siri Speaker will be announced alongside “software development details for home AI.” As for an announcement, both Dickson and KGI have claimed Siri Speaker will see an unveil at Apple’s WWDC event next month, which is somewhat surprising given how the event has been almost exclusively software-focused over recent years. Though, it makes sense seeing how Apple did not hold its usual March hardware event this year. KGI: Apple likely to launch 10.5-inch iPad Pro and Siri Speaker at WWDC alongside new software Bloomberg: Unclear if Siri Speaker will feature display, Amazon open to Apple Music on Echo Phil Schiller says voice-only assistants are sometimes convenient So, that’s what we currently know about Siri Speaker: a standalone hardware device with a more powerful Siri, a touch interface, hi-fi speakers, and a WWDC unveil.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 17 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Wickfire, LLC Found Guilty of Intentional Interference With TriMax Media’s Business DALLAS, May 16, 2017 /PRNewswire/ — An Austin based jury unanimously found that Wickfire, LLC intentionally interfered with one or more of TriMax Media LLC’s contracts. However, the jury failed to award damages. TriMax has filed a notice of appeal regarding the lack of damages awarded as well as other portions of the jury verdict. The case was tried in the Western District of Texas, styled as Civil Action No. 14-CV-34. The lawsuit centered around Google AdWords Auctions, an online-auction platform where companies like TriMax and Wickfire compete for advertising space. TriMax argued Wickfire intentionally interfered with TriMax’s contracts by (1) paying kickbacks to merchant representatives in exchange for exclusivity agreements; (2) impersonating TriMax by placing unauthorized ads that plagiarized TriMax’s ad copy and contained other identifying information of TriMax; (3) repeatedly clicking on TriMax ads in order to artificially increase TriMax’s costs (known as „click fraud”); and (4) using an automated software program to manipulate the Google auction system (known as „bid jamming”).  At trial, a financial expert testified that due to Wickfire’s intentional interference over the past five years, TriMax’s damages exceeded $22 million. TriMax presented evidence to the jury that Wickfire had been suspended from over 200 Google accounts, violated merchant terms, and employed fake user agents and proxies to conceal its identity. The jury also saw evidence that Google referred to Wickfire as „known fraudsters” and that Wickfire registered the domain name „GoogleClickFraud.com”. TriMax also presented evidence regarding Wickfire’s destruction of evidence. TriMax learned that during the litigation, Wickfire wiped all the data from its Chief Technology Officer’s laptop, and then failed to disclose that information to TriMax or the court. Once TriMax uncovered the destruction, Wickfire claimed it was necessary, since the laptop had been stolen during a home burglary. However, the police report—which TriMax obtained independently after Wickfire failed to produce a copy—contradicted Wickfire’s story by mentioning nothing about an allegedly stolen laptop. While the jury heard extensive evidence about Wickfire’s conduct comprising the intentional interference, some of the most devastating evidence was excluded. For example, the jury was not permitted to see: The police report from the burglary; Registration documents showing Wickfire as the owner of „BitchesOfFacebook.com” and „PokeBitches.com”; An e-mail from a merchant representative who—after refusing to accept the alleged kickbacks—referred to Wickfire as „criminals”; Screenshots of Wickfire’s ads impersonating TriMax’s; An e-mail from a merchant terminating TriMax after wrongly believing TriMax was the source of the impersonating ads; An e-mail from a merchant complaining that Wickfire violated trademark terms and plagiarized TriMax’s ads; A lengthy technical report that, according to a world-renowned computer expert, proves conclusively that Wickfire committed extensive click fraud against TriMax; A real-time video demonstrating the bid-jamming TriMax experienced; A summary of hundreds of TriMax’s merchant contracts interfered with by bid-jamming; and E-mails from other competitors of Wickfire complaining about Wickfire’s bidding tactics. Despite the jury’s finding against Wickfire for intentional interference, no damages were awarded. A post-trial order reasoned the jury might have believed that Wickfire thought its bidding tactics did not violate Google policies. However, the jury was not permitted to see the actual Google policies at issue or hear testimony from the computer expert that Google’s policies prohibit gaming the AdWords auction. TriMax also brought defamation claims against Wickfire and its co-owners for telling third parties that TriMax committed click fraud. TriMax denied the allegations. Among TriMax’s key exculpatory evidence was the testimony of a third-party suspect who, in response to a question about whether she committed click fraud, pleaded the Fifth Amendment. However, the jury was precluded from seeing additional evidence about this third party, including e-mails in which she used a false identity to communicate with Wickfire. The jury found Wickfire and its co-owners published the statements about TriMax, but again, did not award TriMax any damages. At trial, Wickfire received additional adverse rulings. The jury ruled against Wickfire on its request for damages on its claim for violation of the Lanham Act. The jury further ruled against Wickfire on its request for exemplary damages. Finally, Wickfire was denied its request for pre-judgment interest. Prior to trial, Wickfire filed multiple discovery motions, which were dismissed, and a motion for summary judgment on TriMax’s claims, which was denied. Wickfire also brought claims against TriMax for injury to business reputation, business disparagement, defamation, unfair competition, and misappropriation. Wickfire dropped each of those claims prior to the start of trial. TriMax will be appealing to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit and will be asking for, among other things, a new trial to determine the amount of damages resulting from the intentional interference the jury found Wickfire committed against TriMax.   Leading the charge for TriMax will be nationally-renowned appellate attorney, Sidney K. Powell. Ms. Powell was formerly an Assistant United States Attorney and author of the groundbreaking book Licensed to Lie, an exposé on unethical attorney conduct and improper concealment of evidence. Ms. Powell served as lead counsel in more than 500 appeals in the Fifth Circuit, resulting in more than 180 published opinions. Although statistically, the Fifth Circuit reverses only approximately 15% of its cases, Ms. Powell publishes a record of succeeding in reversing more than 70% of the cases in which she has represented and sought reversal. TriMax’s CEO, Laura Woodruff, commented: „We’re thrilled Ms. Powell has agreed to lead the fight against Wickfire. Given Ms. Powell’s unmatched experience and record of accomplishment at the Fifth Circuit, along with the fact she only accepts few select cases, we have every reason to expect she will deliver a complete victory. Once the smoke clears, we are confident our efforts in this litigation will culminate in an award of damages to TriMax for the interference the jury found against Wickfire and TriMax’s complete exoneration as to Wickfire’s claims.” About TriMax Media: Founded in 2003, TriMax Media is a digital marketing agency specializing in performance-based search engine marketing.

Google Assistant, Microsoft’s Cortana and Amazon’s Alexa are all aiming to take Siri’s crown. The problem, however, is that many Apple owners are so deeply embedded in the ecosystem that there’s little risk of them switching platforms – especially not from an iPhone to an Android phone. So while Google Assistant in theory put Apple under pressure to improve Siri, in practice, not so much. But if Google Assistant does indeed make it onto the iPhone this week as reported, that’s a new ballgame … NordVPN For the first time, iPhone owners will be able to easily and directly compare the performance of Siri and Google’s competitor. Doing so will be as easy as tapping the Google Assistant app and then trying the same query with both that and Siri to see which produces better results. None of the four competing platforms seem to get a clear edge in comparisons, but it’s clear that Google Assistant is the one Siri needs to beat. Business Insider said that Siri and Google Assistant both got an equal number of responses right, but the latter had a slight edge. If I were to simply count each “winner” above, Siri would be right there with it. Things are closer than the recent Google hype machine would suggest. Technically, though, Google Assistant was the smoothest to use. I didn’t have to repeat myself as many times as I did with the others. It was also the most adept at understanding context. Even if Siri feels more in tune with the device it’s a part of, I felt more like a robot talking to it. The Assistant is also fun — it runs like something Google’s people enjoyed being creative with. And in the areas where Google was behind, the gap wasn’t huge. Digital Trends concluded that Siri had the least functionality, and also gave the edge to Google. Overall, we give the nod to Google Assistant. While Cortana can technically do more, the fact Cortana is only available on Android and iOS as a thidr-party app limits the assistant’s appeal while on the go. We think Google Assistant and Cortana are the current best bets for people who want a single do-it-all assistant. Know Your Mobile said that Google Assistant gets more verbal replies, and was more conversational. In the end Brownlee concluded that Google Assistant is more audio-based and conversational, reading out answers to your queries and displaying very little text or additional information. Siri, on the other hand, is more visual-based, serving up plenty of charts and graphs to go with its answers. But in the end Brownlee said he judges how capable a personal digital assistant is based on how much like a robot the user needs to speak like to get the correct answers. Since Google Assistant is better able to detect what you want using conversational and contextual learning, it’s more natural to use and thus more competent. TNW said that Siri was faster, but Google Assistant was better. While there was little difference in speed between the two virtual assistants, Siri was often a split second faster to answer. However, Google Assistant seemed to provide more accurate and detailed results – and also more relevant when taking into account previous searches. Part of the reason for that is Google’s new and improved AI algorithm which, in addition to being more conversational, has also learned how to understand and factor in the context of the questions asked. In contrast, Siri tends to ignore context in some cases, merely pulling up results from Bing and other search engines. MIT Technology Review considers Google Assistant more ambitious that Siri. For example, one executive demonstrated how Assistant could play the correct track when given the command “Play the Shakira song from Zootopia.” […] The more invested in Google’s existing products and services you are, the more powerful Assistant becomes. It integrates with the Google Photos service, for example, so you can ask things like “Show me my photos of snow from last December.” So while it’s undoubtedly true that each intelligent assistant has its strengths and weaknesses, and claims that Siri has fallen behind are exaggerated, it also can’t be denied that – despite Siri’s head start – Apple has allowed competitors to quickly catch up, if not overtake. Using Google Assistant will, of course, be less convenient than using Siri: holding down the Home button versus opening an app. That’s the home ground advantage Apple has. But with iPhone users able to test both and make their own decision about which to use, that significantly ramps up the pressure on Apple to boost the capabilities of its own assistant. And as someone who believes competition drives innovation, that can only be a good thing. Ben Lovejoy @benlovejoy Ben Lovejoy is a British technology writer and EU Editor for 9to5Mac.

The Mountain View, California-based company will announce a standalone Google Assistant app for the iPhone on 17 May. As we reported earlier, thanks to a leak from Android Police, the app should arrive first in the US, but Google is working to launch it in other countries. The iPhone version of Assistant will take commands via voice and integrate with other Google apps on the iPhone. So, for instance, you could ask to the Assistant to play a video and it will appear via the YouTube app installed on your device. Google Assistant will also show up in Google's Photos app somehow, which Bloomberg said is further being updated so that it can create a physical coffee table photo book.  Forget Bitmoji: Allo uses neural networks to personalise emoji Google Fuchsia OS: What's the story so far?

 Google is going to announce a new VR headset at its big event Steve Kovach May 16, 2017, 6:04 PM 1,442 facebook linkedin twitter email print Google's Daydream View VR headset. Darren Weaver Google plans to announce a new virtual reality headset at its annual I/O developers conference Wednesday, Janko Roettgers of Variety reports. Unlike Google's current Daydream View headset that requires a phone to work, this will be a standalone device similar to what we've seen with Facebook's Oculus Rift and HTC's Vive.  The headset is also said to have inside-out tracking, which means users won't have to install sensors around the room to track their movements. Microsoft has touted inside-out tracking in its HoloLens and other third-party Windows VR headsets as a key differentiator from the competition. Oculus is also working an inside-out tracking headset.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 17 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Wickfire, LLC Found Guilty of Intentional Interference With TriMax Media’s Business DALLAS, May 16, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- An Austin based jury unanimously found that Wickfire, LLC intentionally interfered with one or more of TriMax Media LLC's contracts. However, the jury failed to award damages. TriMax has filed a notice of appeal regarding the lack of damages awarded as well as other portions of the jury verdict. The case was tried in the Western District of Texas, styled as Civil Action No. 14-CV-34. The lawsuit centered around Google AdWords Auctions, an online-auction platform where companies like TriMax and Wickfire compete for advertising space. TriMax argued Wickfire intentionally interfered with TriMax's contracts by (1) paying kickbacks to merchant representatives in exchange for exclusivity agreements; (2) impersonating TriMax by placing unauthorized ads that plagiarized TriMax's ad copy and contained other identifying information of TriMax; (3) repeatedly clicking on TriMax ads in order to artificially increase TriMax's costs (known as "click fraud"); and (4) using an automated software program to manipulate the Google auction system (known as "bid jamming").  At trial, a financial expert testified that due to Wickfire's intentional interference over the past five years, TriMax's damages exceeded $22 million. TriMax presented evidence to the jury that Wickfire had been suspended from over 200 Google accounts, violated merchant terms, and employed fake user agents and proxies to conceal its identity. The jury also saw evidence that Google referred to Wickfire as "known fraudsters" and that Wickfire registered the domain name "GoogleClickFraud.com". TriMax also presented evidence regarding Wickfire's destruction of evidence. TriMax learned that during the litigation, Wickfire wiped all the data from its Chief Technology Officer's laptop, and then failed to disclose that information to TriMax or the court. Once TriMax uncovered the destruction, Wickfire claimed it was necessary, since the laptop had been stolen during a home burglary. However, the police report—which TriMax obtained independently after Wickfire failed to produce a copy—contradicted Wickfire's story by mentioning nothing about an allegedly stolen laptop. While the jury heard extensive evidence about Wickfire's conduct comprising the intentional interference, some of the most devastating evidence was excluded. For example, the jury was not permitted to see: The police report from the burglary; Registration documents showing Wickfire as the owner of "BitchesOfFacebook.com" and "PokeBitches.com"; An e-mail from a merchant representative who—after refusing to accept the alleged kickbacks—referred to Wickfire as "criminals"; Screenshots of Wickfire's ads impersonating TriMax's; An e-mail from a merchant terminating TriMax after wrongly believing TriMax was the source of the impersonating ads; An e-mail from a merchant complaining that Wickfire violated trademark terms and plagiarized TriMax's ads; A lengthy technical report that, according to a world-renowned computer expert, proves conclusively that Wickfire committed extensive click fraud against TriMax; A real-time video demonstrating the bid-jamming TriMax experienced; A summary of hundreds of TriMax's merchant contracts interfered with by bid-jamming; and E-mails from other competitors of Wickfire complaining about Wickfire's bidding tactics. Despite the jury's finding against Wickfire for intentional interference, no damages were awarded. A post-trial order reasoned the jury might have believed that Wickfire thought its bidding tactics did not violate Google policies. However, the jury was not permitted to see the actual Google policies at issue or hear testimony from the computer expert that Google's policies prohibit gaming the AdWords auction. TriMax also brought defamation claims against Wickfire and its co-owners for telling third parties that TriMax committed click fraud. TriMax denied the allegations. Among TriMax's key exculpatory evidence was the testimony of a third-party suspect who, in response to a question about whether she committed click fraud, pleaded the Fifth Amendment. However, the jury was precluded from seeing additional evidence about this third party, including e-mails in which she used a false identity to communicate with Wickfire. The jury found Wickfire and its co-owners published the statements about TriMax, but again, did not award TriMax any damages. At trial, Wickfire received additional adverse rulings. The jury ruled against Wickfire on its request for damages on its claim for violation of the Lanham Act. The jury further ruled against Wickfire on its request for exemplary damages. Finally, Wickfire was denied its request for pre-judgment interest. Prior to trial, Wickfire filed multiple discovery motions, which were dismissed, and a motion for summary judgment on TriMax's claims, which was denied. Wickfire also brought claims against TriMax for injury to business reputation, business disparagement, defamation, unfair competition, and misappropriation. Wickfire dropped each of those claims prior to the start of trial. TriMax will be appealing to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit and will be asking for, among other things, a new trial to determine the amount of damages resulting from the intentional interference the jury found Wickfire committed against TriMax.   Leading the charge for TriMax will be nationally-renowned appellate attorney, Sidney K. Powell. Ms. Powell was formerly an Assistant United States Attorney and author of the groundbreaking book Licensed to Lie, an exposé on unethical attorney conduct and improper concealment of evidence. Ms. Powell served as lead counsel in more than 500 appeals in the Fifth Circuit, resulting in more than 180 published opinions. Although statistically, the Fifth Circuit reverses only approximately 15% of its cases, Ms. Powell publishes a record of succeeding in reversing more than 70% of the cases in which she has represented and sought reversal. TriMax's CEO, Laura Woodruff, commented: "We're thrilled Ms. Powell has agreed to lead the fight against Wickfire. Given Ms. Powell's unmatched experience and record of accomplishment at the Fifth Circuit, along with the fact she only accepts few select cases, we have every reason to expect she will deliver a complete victory. Once the smoke clears, we are confident our efforts in this litigation will culminate in an award of damages to TriMax for the interference the jury found against Wickfire and TriMax's complete exoneration as to Wickfire's claims."

With one line of code, an IoT device has access to Google’s entire geospatial database of Wi-Fi and cellular networks. IoT devices with cellular and Wi-Fi can now be pinpointed even without GPS modules thanks to Particle and Google. The Google Maps API can also be used to augment existing GPS applications for faster fixes and to provide location data if GPS fails. “This integration enables Particle to provide a high-value feature to any of our customers with an over-the-air software update and Google Cloud,” according to Richard Whitney, VP of Product at Particle. When IoT sensors know their location, the data is more robust, helping companies make more informed, high-order decisions. For the example of a cold chain app powered by Particle devices and Google Maps and Cloud, assets can be tracked both indoors and out. In dense urban environments GPS signals can easily be blocked by tall buildings or roofs. The Geolocation API will continue to work without GPS to continue to track your assets. In the cold supply chain, temperature and location are key pieces of data that need to be tracked in the factory, the loading dock and in transit. These tools enable a holistic view of the supply chain and its ability to deliver a high-quality product. When building a product on the Particle Photon, the Geolocation API creates an easy, seamless setup experience. Particle devices can then autoconfigure time zone, tune to available broadcast bands and connect to regional service providers. With those capabilities, location aware window blinds can reference the number of available hours of sunlight to know how to passively heat a room. Google and Particle will be demoing the integration at IoT world. Stop by the booth #310 to see the demo in person, or for more information, review the developer documentation. About Particle Particle is a scalable, reliable and secure Internet of Things device platform that enables businesses to quickly and easily build, connect and manage their connected solutions. Particle aims to making the Internet of Things easy and accessible. Particle's tools are used by over 100,000 engineers in more than 170 countries, including Fortune 500 companies who are developing and managing fleets of new IoT products.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 16 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman No GPS, No Problem: New Google Maps and Particle IoT Integration SAN FRANCISCO–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Google Maps has just announced the integration with IoT startup, Particle. With one line of code, an IoT device has access to Google’s entire geospatial database of Wi-Fi and cellular networks. IoT devices with cellular and Wi-Fi can now be pinpointed even without GPS modules thanks to Particle and Google. The Google Maps API can also be used to augment existing GPS applications for faster fixes and to provide location data if GPS fails. “This integration enables Particle to provide a high-value feature to any of our customers with an over-the-air software update and Google Cloud,” according to Richard Whitney, VP of Product at Particle. When IoT sensors know their location, the data is more robust, helping companies make more informed, high-order decisions. For the example of a cold chain app powered by Particle devices and Google Maps and Cloud, assets can be tracked both indoors and out. In dense urban environments GPS signals can easily be blocked by tall buildings or roofs. The Geolocation API will continue to work without GPS to continue to track your assets. In the cold supply chain, temperature and location are key pieces of data that need to be tracked in the factory, the loading dock and in transit. These tools enable a holistic view of the supply chain and its ability to deliver a high-quality product. When building a product on the Particle Photon, the Geolocation API creates an easy, seamless setup experience. Particle devices can then autoconfigure time zone, tune to available broadcast bands and connect to regional service providers. With those capabilities, location aware window blinds can reference the number of available hours of sunlight to know how to passively heat a room. Google and Particle will be demoing the integration at IoT world. Stop by the booth #310 to see the demo in person, or for more information, review the developer documentation. About Particle Particle is a scalable, reliable and secure Internet of Things device platform that enables businesses to quickly and easily build, connect and manage their connected solutions. Particle aims to making the Internet of Things easy and accessible. Particle’s tools are used by over 100,000 engineers in more than 170 countries, including Fortune 500 companies who are developing and managing fleets of new IoT products. Their portfolio includes Wi-Fi and Cellular connectivity modules, a cellular data platform, a device management console, and a comprehensive set of development tools. Particle was listed as one of Fast Company’s Most Innovative Companies of 2015 and its CEO, Zach Supalla, has spoken as an authority on the Internet of Things at prominent events such as OSCON, Solid, Web Summit, GMIC, and Launch.

Take The Quiz To Find Out Do Associates Defy Generational Stereotypes? Download Our Free Report Intellectual Property, Technology Self-Driving… To Criminal Charges? This legal battle between Google and Uber has it all: cutting-edge technology, juicy facts, and top-tier legal talent. By Gaston Kroub May 16, 2017 at 4:47 PM Shares5 Google’s driverless car (by Grendelkhan via Wikimedia) Ed. note: Gaston Kroub, who has been writing about differences between Biglaw and boutique life in his “Beyond Biglaw” column, will be shifting his focus to intellectual property law, the area in which he practices. But he might pop back into the law firm management space from time to time, as the spirit moves him. At any given time, certain IP cases will garner broader media attention. Whether they involve ubiquitous products (e.g., Apple-Samsung), big damages numbers (e.g. Carnegie Mellon v. Marvell), or famous brands (e.g., Aquazzura v. Ivanka Trump), certain disputes catapult themselves into the public consciousness. There are benefits to the IP community of clients and IP lawyers that result. Each time one of these cases crosses over from being of interest to the IP community to capturing the attention of the public at large, it helps raise the profile of IP as a critical aspect of today’s global economy. Furthermore, the media attention helps educate the public on IP law, even if it is at a basic level. For IP professionals, these mega-cases often involve interesting issues, and because of the high stakes involved, these cases often lead to rounds of appeals and the making of new law — thereby leaving an impact that often outlives their time in the public consciousness. Perhaps the most interesting IP case of the moment is playing out in San Francisco, in the courtroom of Judge William Alsup, a well-respected jurist in the Northern District of California. The case has it all. Cutting-edge technology at issue? Check, as the case involves self-driving technology, which when adopted will affect us all. Top legal teams? Also check, with Quinn Emanuel, Morrison & Foerster, and Boies Schiller on the docket sheet. Juicy facts? Sure, with allegations of trade secret theft levied by Waymo (Google’s self-driving car project) against Uber, the company that people love, or love to hate, in seemingly equal measure. While the case is progressing rapidly, it may end up having a lot to tell us about the limits of IP law, or at least how certain issues in IP cases may have broader ramifications than just remedies like damages and injunctions. The background story of the case has been addressed in other places, and there is no doubt that the case has already caught the public’s attention. The figure at the center of the sordid saga is a former Google engineer, Anthony Levandowski, a recognized pioneer in self-driving technology, and former technical lead of Google’s efforts in that area. In early 2016, he left Google to form his own startup, Otto, which was quickly snapped up for $680 million by Uber — one of Google’s leading competitors in the race to commercialize self-driving cars. The problem? Apparently Levandowski did not leave Google empty-handed, allegedly taking with him thousands of highly confidential and mission-critical technical documents. While Uber may have benefited from the contents of those documents, its purchase of Levandowski’s startup has also embroiled the company in what is quickly turning into a trade secret misappropriation case for the ages. According to Waymo, Uber was able to get a self-driving car on the road in nine months because of Levandowski’s theft of trade secrets, erasing whatever head start Waymo had developed over seven years of prior efforts. A telltale sign that this case is of major importance is the fact that it has been pending only for a few months — and there is already a Federal Circuit appeal on file. Perhaps the biggest news came down late last week, when Judge Alsup entered a string of orders with major ramifications for the combatants in this high-stakes battle. First, he ruled that Uber could not be a beneficiary of arbitration clauses in Levandowski’s employment agreements with Waymo. (A separate set of arbitration proceedings between Waymo and Levandowski for breach of those agreements are pending.) In that order, Judge Alsup found that the equities demanded that Waymo’s case against Uber could continue in in his courtroom, noting that “Levandowski’s assertion of his Fifth Amendment privilege has obstructed” discovery in the case and hampered the construction of “a complete narrative as to the fate of Waymo’s purloined files.” In line with that finding, Judge Alsup also decided Waymo’s motion for provisional relief on its trade secret misappropriation claim, which (even though it was issued under seal) apparently was at least granted in part based on a detailed evidentiary record. Finally, and unusually for an IP case, Judge Alsup referred to the U.S. Attorney his order on Waymo’s motion, “for investigation of possible theft of trade secrets” — in other words, for investigation of possible criminal activity and potential prosecution of individuals associated with any such activity. This series of bombshell orders potentially portends serious consequences for Uber and Levandowski. For Uber, any injunctive relief granted to Waymo could derail its significant investment in a self-driving car program, and set back the company’s efforts to reduce its cost structure going forward. Considering the generally negative press the company has been rocked with over the past few months, another finding of wrongdoing is something that the company will surely want to avoid. For Levandowski, the introduction of potential criminal charges, if the U.S. Attorney decides to act on Judge Alsup’s referral, is as serious as it gets. At the same time, it would be a mistake to rush to judgment, and ascribe wrongdoing to either Uber or Levandowski at this stage. While it is clear that the case is on a fast track, with a trial date set for early October, the number of twists and turns at even these early stages suggests that much more is to come. Ultimately, the introduction of potential criminal charges in any IP case, no matter how valuable from a monetary perspective, raises the stakes to a level that even the most high-profile IP case would be likely to reach otherwise. There is no doubt, however, that temptation exists for both employees and companies to take short cuts, particularly in fast-moving and valuable areas of technology. In the current environment, innovative companies will have to redouble their efforts to protect their trade secrets, and move quickly to patent inventions on technologies they can afford to disclose. At the same time, innovative companies must be realistic about the limits of civil litigation to achieve their objectives. But for the participants in this case, the time for battle is now. And many will be watching to see which side drives off to victory. Please feel free to send comments or questions to me at gkroub@kskiplaw.com or via Twitter: @gkroub.

Variety Editions: U.S Global Asia Subscribe Today! Navigation Menu Film TV Digital Music Contenders Video Dirt Scene More Biz Legit Jobs Conferences Insight Archives Directory Choose Edition: U.S Global Asia Russia | My Account Sign In Subscribe Home Digital News Google May Preview Its New VR Headset at I/O Conference (EXCLUSIVE) Janko Roettgers Senior Silicon Valley Correspondent @jank0 Share This Article LinkedIn Email Print Talk kretsudmitry / Shutterstock May 16, 2017 | 02:44PM PT Google plans to use this week’s Google I/O developer conference to give developers a first look at its next-generation virtual reality headset, Variety has learned from multiple sources with knowledge of the project. The headset is being described as a standalone mobile VR device, meaning that it won’t require a phone or a PC to run VR games and experiences. Google has reportedly been working on such a standalone headset for more than a year. The technology used for it has been described as cutting-edge, and will likely include inside-out positional tracking. With that in mind, sources also cautioned that the company may decide to only give a limited preview, and there’s always a chance that it may scrap the unveiling altogether and instead focus on its existing Daydream VR platform. A Google spokesperson declined to comment. Google’s developer conference is being held in Mountain View from Wednesday to Friday, and the company has scheduled keynote events for Wednesday and Thursday morning. Google used last year’s Google I/O developer conference to unveil Daydream, its Android-based mobile VR platform that combines makes use of high-end handsets to power VR games and experiences. The device that Google plans to show off this week has been described by a source as the next step for these efforts, but it’s unclear whether the device will run Android, or make use of a separate operating system altogether. In many ways, a standalone headset would help Google to put together many pieces of the VR puzzle the company had been assembling over the past few years. On of these pieces is Tango, its Augmented Reality (AR) platform. Tango started out as a project of Google’s X lab, but has since become part of the same VR group that has also been developing Daydream. Tango phones are capable of mapping a room, allowing developers to arrange virtual characters in relation to real objects and track the movement of the phone as it user moves through the room. Much of the same technology could also be used for positional tracking, which means that the headset can track a user’s movements in space, knowing if someone leans forward or takes a step. This kind of technology is being supported by Facebook’s Oculus Rift headset, Sony’s PlayStation VR and HTC’s Vive, but all of these headsets make use of external cameras and sensors to track a user. Google’s headset is instead supposed to use on-board sensors for what’s been called inside-out tracking, taking away the need to install any external hardware. Inside-out tracking is seen as the next big thing for virtual reality, and has the potential to drastically simplify the use of VR headsets. That’s why Facebook has been working on its own standalone VR headset with inside-out tracking, which it first showed off at Oculus Connect last year. HTC has also committed to building a standalone headset with inside-out tracking, and the technology is key to Microsoft’s mixed-reality efforts and will be part of upcoming headsets from Acer and HP. Another piece of the puzzle in Google’s VR quest is its stockpile of great VR apps. Early on, Google acquired Tiltbrush, the drawing app that lets users create 3D paintings and that has even been embraced by Disney animation legend Glen Keane. Late last year, Google released Google Earth for virtual reality, which has since become one of the highest-rated VR apps on HTC’s Vive VR headset. And earlier this month, Google acquired Owlchemy Labs, the maker of the Job Simulator, another highly-popular VR game. With this, Google now owns three VR killer apps. But Tiltbrush, Google Earth and Job Simulator also have something else in common: They don’t work on Google’s Daydream headset, and instead have been released on Oculus Rift and HTC Vive. With a standalone headset, Google may be able to fully participate in all areas of VR and mixed reality — but it likely will take some time before such a device would be sold to consumers. Not only will developers need to figure out new apps and experiences optimized for that particular hardware, but there are also several non-trivial technical challenges to make these devices work for consumers. This includes getting inside-out tracking to work in a variety of environments, as well as power consumption issues. That’s why  anything shown at Google I/O this week may just be an early glimpse at the next generation of VR coming from Google.

The new app, which supports glide typing, lets users search straight from the keyboard, using normal Google search. Once the information is found, user can send it into their application without leaving the keyboard, technewsworld.com reported. No matter what application a user is using, SMS, email, WhatsApp or messenger, the Google logo is always present in the keyboard. “It’s like having a google search in any app, right from the keyboard . . . so we called it a Gboard,” said Google in a video posted in its YouTube account. “Solutions like Google’s Gboard and glide typing are designed to simplify and speed up common tasks. That can be a real boon when you’re under time pressure or are trying to create a complex message on a keyboard of limited size,” Principal Analyst at Pund-IT Charles King was quoted as saying in the same report. Emojis can be searched easily in the search bar. Typing words like “angry,” “pizza,” “cat,” and “car,” user can see all the relevant emoji characters in an instant. In addition, the application can be customized depending to the user’s liking. The user has the option to unable the glide typing, toggle things like auto-correction, auto-capitalization, enable caps lock, among others. Right now, Gboard app is only available in the United States and company has yet to announce when it will be available to download elsewhere.

Google today announced a fully-managed Google Cloud Platform (GCP) service called Google Cloud IoT Core, aimed at allowing companies to securely connect and manage IoT devices at scale. Indranil Chakraborty, Google Cloud Product Manager says: "Many enterprises that rely on industrial devices such as sensors, conveyor belts, farming equipment, medical equipment and pumps — particularly, globally distributed ones — are struggling to monitor and manage those devices for several reasons." Those reasons Chakraborty says include: operational cost and complexity, patchwork security, and data fragmentation. "Cloud IoT Core is designed to help resolve these problems by removing risk, complexity and data silos from the device monitoring and management process."

Last year's conference had a host of major announcements worthy of such a high-profile venue -- it's where Google Home, the Google Assistant and the Daydream VR headset were all introduced. But this year, things seem like they'll be a little quieter, at least in terms of big consumer-facing hardware. It'll probably be a year of refinement, where big initiatives continue to be polished. We'll be there all three days this year, bringing you breaking news, analysis, interviews, videos and more. Without the benefit of a crystal ball, here's what we think we'll be talking about this week. © AOLAndroid O Even though Google started releasing developer previews of Android months ahead of I/O, the event is still where we get into the nitty-gritty of how the company's mobile OS will change this year. We haven't seen many big consumer-facing features in Android O just yet, although the revamped notification system sounds like it could be incredibly useful as more and more apps vie for our attention. Ditto that for the "copyless pasting" system that Google teased a few weeks ago -- we should definitely hear more on that front. Popular Searches Sothebys BID ▲ 50.51 +0.51 +1.02% New York Times Co NYT ▼ 17.10 -0.15 -0.87% Urban Outfitters Inc URBN ▼ 20.46 -0.49 -2.34% Fortuna Silver Mines Inc FSM ▼ 4.53 -0.02 -0.44% Otherwise, we're looking at a lot of behind-the-scenes improvements, but two of them could significantly impact the way people use their phones. Google is yet again promising to have made major advances in power-saving thanks to a new "background limit" feature that'll restrict what apps can do when they aren't front and center. Background services, location updates and "implicit broadcasts" will all be subject to automatic limiting by Android to help developers create apps that don't trash your battery life -- expect to hear more about how that all works during Wednesday's keynote. Just a few days ago, Google spilled the news about "Project Treble," the latest attempt to make it easier for all Android smartphones to be updated to the most current operating system. Ever since it launched, phones that weren't under Google's direct control (like the Nexus and Pixel lines) lines have had to wait months for the latest version. And, sometimes it never arrives at all. But Project Treble's new modular approach to Android means that from O forward, devices should receive updates much faster. We haven't heard too much about Instant Apps after they were introduced at I/O 2016. But the idea of being able to quickly load run a full Android app by clicking on a URL could make life a lot easier for Android users. Google did start limited testing of Instant Apps earlier this year, and we're hoping to get some news about when they might be ready for consumers. Otherwise, we should hopefully hear about some Android O features that hasn't been announced yet -- there will almost certainly be some surprises in store. © Engadget/AOLGoogle Assistant The Google Assistant was probably the biggest announcement at I/O 2016, and that's all because CEO Sundar Pichai said he wants it available basically anywhere you use Google. And he wants it to be personalized to you. One year in and that goal hasn't quite been met yet, although there's no doubt that Google's conversational AI bot can be smart and useful in the right circumstances. Thus far, the main limitation has been availability. Assistant is integrated right into the Google Allo chat app, but it's been hard getting users to switch over from texting, Hangouts, Facebook Messenger and the plethora of other messaging apps out there. Pixel smartphone owners have it baked right in, and it's rolling out to other Android phones as well, but there are still plenty of smartphones without it. And while Google Home is a good first attempt to take on Alexa, Amazon has a big lead here in sales and third-party compatibility. Load Error We expect Google to address the challenges facing the Assistant head-on at I/O. We'll likely see partnerships to get the Assistant on more smart home hardware and better ways for third-party developers to work with Google's AI bot. We'll surely hear about new capabilities, as well -- earlier today, Bloomberg reported that Google would bring the Assistant to the iPhone and start building it into GE's home appliances. Those would be two big ways for the Assistant to reach more customers. © AOLDaydream VR Perhaps the most exciting developments will come from Google's ever-growing virtual (and augmented) reality teams. Google's DayDream VR platform launched at last year's event, and while it was a bid to improve the quality of mobile VR experiences, the impact has been limited. The headset only works on Google's Pixel phones and a handful of other devices. Expect an update on Daydream, although it may be just more colored headsets rather than anything major. We'd keep an eye on Tango too: the company's 3D-mapping phones are one of the strongest augmented reality offerings so far. Google says it's no longer a project, which sounds like Tango is ready for prime-time. © Nathan Ingraham / EngadgetAndroid Auto Earlier this week, Google announced that Android Auto would be the default option for infotainment in new Volvo and Audi vehicles. Cars with this new software will be on display at I/O this year, so we'll get to see what happens when Android Auto is the one and only solution for music, navigation and other voice-activated features. Google teased something like this back at I/O in 2016, when we got to see a concept Maserati where Android ran every screen in the car -- it even controlled the heating and A/C. While Volvo and Audi's cars don't go this far yet, it's still notable to see new vehicles where you don't need a phone to use Android Auto. Hopefully it'll be better than the stock infotainment system found in most cars these days. © AOLEverything else Android Wear: It's been a year since Google first took the wraps off Android Wear 2.0, a major upgrade to the company's smartwatch OS. But it was delayed far past the original fall launch timeframe, and in the last 12 months most Android Wear products were not terribly compelling. Google is almost certain to mention Wear onstage, but what exactly it'll have to share is a bit of a mystery. With Wear 2.0 only just making its way to consumers, we don't imagine it'll get much of an overhaul this year. Chrome OS: Google also announced its intention to bring Android apps to Chromebooks last year -- but like Wear 2.0, the launch has been slow going. Samsung and Google announced the Chromebook Pro at CES, a laptop built specifically with Android apps in mind. Unfortunately, Samsung didn't hit that release date, though there are signs we might see it announced before long -- perhaps on stage this week, in fact. From the software end, we're expecting more details on how Google can encourage developers to write apps that'll work on both phones and laptops. Fuschia: This one is a bit of a longshot. Last week, screenshots and details about Google's mysterious "Fuschia" operating system were posted by Ars Technica. In a lot of ways, it looks like a new mobile phone OS that leaves behind a lot of the baggage that Android has accumulated over the years. That's just what this current version looks like; it doesn't mean Fuschia is necessarily destined for phones. Google hasn't made any public statements about what they're doing with it, but there's an outside chance we'll hear about it this week. Android O's name: A new version of Android means a new dessert-themed code name. Oreo? Oatmeal cookie? There aren't a lot of mainstream treats with an O at the beginning. Last year, Google punted this to the crowd, taking suggestions for what the name would be. It wouldn't surprise us to see them do the same thing this year.

Netflix confirms it is blocking rooted/unlocked devices, app itself is still working (for now) Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/05/13 3:08pm PDTMay 13, 2017 234 Plus 1 on G+ 1125 Share on Facebook 427 Share on Twitter Total Shares1786 Applications News Earlier today, Netflix started showing up as 'incompatible' on the Play Store for rooted and unlocked Android devices. However, the app itself continued to work fine, leading some (including myself) to think it could have been an accident. However, Netflix has now confirmed to us that blocking modified devices from downloading the app was intentional. This is the full statement: With our latest 5.0 release, we now fully rely on the Widevine DRM provided by Google; therefore, many devices that are not Google-certified or have been altered will no longer work with our latest app and those users will no longer see the Netflix app in the Play Store. If you're not familiar with it, Widevine is a Google-made DRM technology that works across various desktop and mobile platforms. Widevine categorizes devices into three security levels, ranging from all processes running in the Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) to not running anything in TEE at all. However, the Play Store listing seems tied to a device's SaftetyNet status (which is used by Android Pay), rather than the Widevine TEE. For example, Artem's bootloader-unlocked stock Pixel is still on Widevine Level 1, the most secure level, but fails SafetyNet because it is unlocked. The update's changelog also confirms the: "Version 5.0 only works with devices that are certified by Google and meet all Android requirements." What isn't exactly clear is why only the Play store listing is blocked, but the app itself continued to function normally. I tried both Netflix 4.16 and 5.0.4 (the latest version, from today), and both worked without problems on my unlocked and rooted Galaxy Tab S (which is labeled as Widevine Security Level 3). Maybe at some point the app will stop working, but that does not appear to be the case right now. If you have a blocked device, I recommend following the Pushbullet channel for Netflix on APKMirror (click the Pushbullet button on that page) so you can continue to receive updates outside the Play Store.

First the vpn's now this... why oh why??? Jimk4003 Surely because licensing is regionally specific, and because rooting has the potential to defeat DRM. I get that it might be annoying for some people, but aren't the reasons obvious? David Juarez But root?? Lol Semianonymous Probably an effort to reduce Region spoofing? Idk how easy that is to do on a stock device. Jimk4003 Because rooting has the potential to defeat DRM. mjh49783ab DRM doesn't work. All DRM does is inconvenience the end user. Jimk4003 Possibly. But Netflix have to negotiate licencing deals with the movie studios, and having DRM helps reassure the studios that the movies they have spent millions of dollars making aren't going to get stolen off Netflix without any attempt to stop it. mjh49783ab One could make the argument that rooting the phone may compromise the DRM. But blocking users from unlocking their phones to switch carriers? That is total bullshit, and is just the sort of thing that encourages users to pirate the content. Jimk4003 Netflix are blocking you from switching carriers? lomsha Sim unlocked phones are fine, unlocked bootloaders are blocked. mjh49783ab They didn't exactly make that clear in the article when I last read it. h4rr4r The studios need to reconsider blu rays then. Way easier to rip. Nothing they do will stop piracy. This kind of thing actually encourages it. Jimk4003 Maybe studios do need to consider Blu-ray's. That isn't Netflix's problem though. h4rr4r No Netflix problem is making sure they don't let the studios reduce the value of their product. If Amazon video works on my devices and Netflix does not that is a big deal to me. In that case I might as well sign up for more addon channels on Amazon with the mkney that currently goes to Netflix. Jimk4003 Agreed. But the studios are responsible for making the product they redistribute. It's certainly a balancing act, and I can see both sides of the argument, but Netflix isn't an inalienable right, and those who don't meet the T&C's are going to miss out. h4rr4r Sure, but the studios and Netflix are going to create pirates with these kind of actions. People aren't going to miss out. They will just pirate what they can't get legally. Jimk4003 Sure, but again, it's a tiny fraction of users. If Netflix can negotiate better terms with studios by blocking rooted devices, and thus improve their business overall at the expense of a few fringe users, it stands to reason that is what Netflix will do. Doby Gillis whaa fucking whaa. Sergio Carmona The only obvious thing here is your sarcasm detector not working properly. Go have it fixed please. Jimk4003 Nah, I'm good. h4rr4r So the reason are to make the product worse for the consumer. Great idea, now piracy looks better and better. Jimk4003 What percentage of phones are rooted though? Most people won't care, or even notice the change. h4rr4r It does not matter, if it drives even one person to piracy that is a loss. Jimk4003 But if they can ensure better licensing deals via these new terms, which will attract more customers at the expense of a few rooted users who make up a tiny fraction of overall users; will Netflix care about that loss? h4rr4r But if it encourages piracy the other side of the contract should want to avoid it. Gaining customers in the short term like this hurts the whole market in the long term. Cyber_Akuma Because yeah, people are going to rip movies from Netflix and not off a Blu-Ray.... and even IF they were to attempt to rip them off Netflix, they would use a PHONE and not a PC.... Jimk4003 Ripping Blu-rays isn't Netflix's problem, and Netflix don't need to try and guess what device someone would try and commit piracy with, when the technology exists to restrict them all. Cyber_Akuma You are missing the point, people aren't going to be ripping from Netflix over ripping from a Blu-Ray, and on top of that, they sure as hell aren't going to be ripping off a phone. And actually, you are wrong, the technology to "resist them all" does NOT actually exist. There is no one technology that "restricts them all" but several different technologies for different platforms with various levels of viability and success. Jimk4003 I said 'the technology exists'. When did I say it was a single piece of technology? Let's not be those guys who get in a pedantic argument about semantics on the internet. Regarding the issue under discussion; Netflix's job is to make their platform as robust as possible against piracy, using whatever technology is available to them. Blu-Ray simply isn't their problem. Cyber_Akuma Because just arguing "technology exists" is worthless, plenty of technology exists, and plenty of it is misused. Technically the technology to remotely brick your phone exists too, doesn't mean it's fine to use just because it "exists". And no, their platform already is robust, you are trying to ignore the fact that people ripping movies off a phone is a complete and total non-issue just to try to argue for Netflix's sake, this is ESPECIALLY considering the fact that it harms far more legitimate people than it helps. Sorry, but no, just a plain and completely undesputable NO. You can't argue that it's ok to use something that will hurt a large majority of people just to potentially possibly stop an extreme minority of people who would not even use this method anyway. That's like arguing it's ok to burn down a house to kill a spider. Jimk4003 "You can't argue that it's ok to use something that will hurt a large majority of people". We're talking about Netflix blocking rooted users; in what reality do they constitute the 'large majority' of Android users? Cyber_Akuma I meant the majority of the rooted users. Last time I checked, over 25% of people with an Android device had root access, which is several million users. And OF those several million rooted users, how many do you think actually use their rooted phone and Netflix app to pirate content? Less than 1% Hell, less than 0.1%? They are hurting over 99% of rooted Android users, which while not the majority of Android users is still a lot, to attempt to stop (and not even that effectively as there have been work-around for SafetyNet checks for nearly a year now) an extreme minority OF a minority from doing something they are unlikely to do due to other methods anyway. Richard Markert >I meant the majority of the rooted users. Even the majority of rooted users is a drop in the ocean when it comes to Android users worldwide. Cyber_Akuma Again, over 25%. You also completely missed the point of the argument in that this hurts nearly all rooted users that would not use this maliciously. Lord Argyris Looks like I'll have to start updating manually then. Or just not bother with the app at all since I rarely use Netflix on my phone as it is. SpasilliumNexus Thank goodness the 3T's Open Beta of OxygenOS is good enough for me to not unlock my device and stick with complete stock. Now I wonder why I haven't received any Netflix app updates beyond 4.16.1 build 15145 on the Play Store, when APKMirror has 4 newer versions. ast00 They asked for it. Now pirate their content knowing that you tried doing it the legal way, but THEY declined. Φώτης Because unlocking your Android powered device is such a "bad" thing to do. Whatever Netflix. Ailín Ó’S Ναι, ακριβώς... 😑 C64 How about some English Rob Google translate says that "Ναι, ακριβώς" translates to "Yes, exactly". pcriz How about some Google translate :-/ C64 This is an English website, so you have to talk English. I'm Dutch, so i talk (or try to talk) English too. It hasn't to be perfect, but it would be bs if I talked Dutch over here. 'Want 90 procent van de mensen hier spreken geen Nederlands' Or do you like to use translate with everything freaking post Φώτης Chill. It was literally just two words. Not that big of a deal, don't you think? AnubArack Is it that hard to write 2 words in another language then? Kevin Strident Yo no se. You try it. Φώτης Of course not.

Geezz what a buncha cry babies xyz He is breaking the most important rule of the internet which is faasusu polo asini. pcriz I could try and translate that and feed a troll. Or I can go on living my life. I may choose the latter. C'est la vie, damn how easy (adult) was that ? d0x360 You can talk in whatever language you want. You won't get many people paying any attention to anything you say but who cares? Also...use Google to translate it. It's that button at the very bottom. Yes, exactly xyz Du-te dracului Rebel without a Clue Want 90 procent van de mensen hier spreekt ;) C64 Sorry i was stoned 🤣 Keletor Thank you much! You are awesome, and I totally respect you for that statement and the use of the Commodore insignia. AntiCoyote Not really fair, every single Dutch person I know speaks English as well as an American :o) C64 I'm sorry that we Dutch learn English at school :p davidus The real reason behind this is that there arent many ppl to talk to in first place, if u only speak dutch. Trust me, i m from a neighbour country ;) Me Or some Bixby xyz I don't think Google can translate dipshit. Seems to be a rarely spoken language. pcriz Um okay, whatever that means. DavidEssex How about not being ignorant. xyz Ignorant? No one speaks every language in the world, dipshit. Өөрийгөө Зөндөө Go ArclightX flüggåәnkб€čhiœßølįên There! Now put that in your pipe and smoke it! C64 Don't quit your day job Narg While I prefer English, I have to say that web browsers today make it dirt simple to translate anything, why get all worked up about this? Not using the tools at hand just show ignorance and lethargy. nasznjoka umetisha mzazi asianrage Is it being Unlocked that is not allowed, or Unlocked and Rooted as well? Corbin Davenport Both.

It's more convenient to steal the videos than to deal with the DRM restrictions. Fedup Exactly. Between VPN'ed torrents and nzbs, my Sonarr downloads all TV shows (netflix, HBO, ABC/CBS/NBC/FOX) automatically within minutes of them being ripped and posted by others. It is 100% automated, and with my Plex server running, I can watch shows anywhere - cost = $0.00. I don't do this to save money. I do it for the convenience, lack of ads, and freedom of time/place shifting. Heck, some shows actually download BEFORE they air on network TV (i.e. Designated Survivor). stan dex 97 new dark web premium links . also included are netfix lifetime membership links as well as graphic Live chat links (use anonymously) https://satoshibox.com/axbr7vnm6ifzk8hwtcreoe28/buy d0x360 I cancelled​ my account, sent them feedback and then just asked a friend who I let use HBO go and a Chromecast ultra if I could use their Netflix. David Gabel That seems rather dumb. Why cancel your service to them yet still use it via someone else? You're not teaching them anything. For an example, let's say you have a MacBook, and Apple does something to piss you off. You sell your MacBook, but then borrow a friend's MacBook. Nothing was actually accomplished. d0x360 Nothing was accomplished? I cancelled my account and let them know why. Now they aren't making money off me but I still to use their service. Your analogy is deeply flawed...deeply. So deeply I don't think you understand exactly what an analogy is. David Gabel So, you're "not giving them money" yet you still support them by using their product. It still seems like your logic is flawed. If you're really that pissed at Netflix, don't use it. Period. Use a different service instead of supporting them by borrowing it off a friend, as they are also giving them money (and support) , too via their subscription. revbones How is using their service for free "supporting" them? They aren't getting any revenue off you if you're not paying them. Saying you're supporting them by not paying them is a little stupid don't you think? xyz lol. So by your "logic" a person who pirates House of Cards is also supporting Netflix ? BobButtons You're doing the opposite of supporting. You're getting the benefits of their service while stopping payment and adding to server load which they pay for. David Gabel So far, your stance is the only one that makes sense. The rest so far are noise Sir Doogie Houser M.D.Esq. 200 You seen like an incredulous douch who I'd suplex onto a park bench for being a lap dog bitch.How is canceling or stealing not doing something.Also,its not a fucking macbook jerkoff its a paid service for TV on a phone they expect to be paid for.BTFO David Gabel And you are a loud mouth keyboard warrior that loves to talk a big game, but in reality have little to no control over anything and use web forums to spout obscenities and violent threats to make yourself feel better. nagi Just another step that makes pirating the same content more convenient... we should really be going the other way if they ever want piracy to be reduced. lomsha Funny thing is their content is available to stream all over the internet. Don't see how this move fights piracy as long as computers have access. This just alienates legit users who are doing nothing nefarious on unlocked/rooted devices. Richard Branches By one everybody pays... Pathum Addarapathirana Dude I root my phone to just get iPhone emojis and to tether without my carrier knowing. Like I'm not stealing anything this will just make me stop paying for Netflix. Latheryin Just a heads up. Those treating hiding mods are fake. There is no way to hide if from the carrier. Heck if they wanted to they could see every web page you load from a ton of different places and ways. Yan Minari That’s why god invented VPN Latheryin Yes but even then it doesn't block everything. qqqqqq My provider absolutely blocks tethering - I've been using various methods, including VPNs, to block it for literally YEARS... Hasn't been difficult. Dylan Harris That's not true. All you have to due to bypass tethering limits on t-mobile is to change the TTL on the tethered device. Latheryin That just gets by the automated checks. Get a live person to randomly pick your account (not really likely but happens) and it is not had to tell if someone is tethering. Dmitri Smirnov All that person will be able to tell is whether customer is using a lot of data or not. And this is the root of the problem: be honest that you are limited traffic, instead of trying to play this game of "we'll pretent we are giving you unlimited data and in return you'll only use small-format mobile device, so that we'll hope that you won't be able to use as much of it". Kind of "all you can eat, but you have to only use a tea cup and one chopstick". Latheryin No the issue is people being entitled and taking advantage of things. You have people running their gaming systems and using hundreds of gb a month. Not only is that kinda dumb but it violate the fair use act in most cell TOS. If people didn't abuse the system then it wouldn't be an issue. Also just some food for thought. If they can't tell anything more then a lot of data just how do they route the traffic properly? Make no mistake. If the carrier wanted to they could tell. I know for a fact that there is a team for both att and Verizon that is tasked with just that. Dmitri Smirnov >No the issue is people being entitled and taking advantage of things. You have people running their gaming systems and using hundreds of gb a month. "taking advantage" I thought that people were in their right by using what they paid for. Allright, tell me this - is it allright for me to watch 4K video on my phone (since the screens allow it now)? What's the difference between this and me watching the same stream on my laptop over my phone's connection? What if I just redirect the video stream to my TV using WiDi or any other technology? How is browsing a site from a laptop different from browsing it from a phone network-congestion-wise? And then it boils down to the same argument - carriers are just hoping you'll use the network less from you phone device, as it's less convenient. The more convenient smartphones become for consuming large volumes of traffic, the sooner carriers will have to more away from this scan and expose the actual numbers. > If people didn't abuse the system then it wouldn't be an issue. If carriers would be honest and upfront about "hidden" caps, then people would not be able to game the system. > Also just some food for thought. If they can't tell anything more then a lot of data just how do they route the traffic properly? Make no mistake. If the carrier wanted to they could tell. Latheryin Tethering was never even an extra charge until people started taking advantage of the mobile networks. Watching 4k videos is not a big deal, using 200gb of mobile data in a cycle is flat out stupid. Mobile networks were not designed for that type of traffic from a single device. Nor was it made to handle running your ps4 while you are gaming. Why do you think that pages are made to be mobile friendly? Not only is it a usability issue but a data usage issue as well. It's not hidden. All people have to do is read the TOS. It's all right there. Yet most people just don't want to take the time to do it and then get made about it. Can't blame the carriers for that. Dmitri Smirnov > Watching 4k videos is not a big deal, using 200gb of mobile data in a cycle is flat out stupid. a) I'm glad we're finally on the same page that the real problem for networks is data usage and not tethering or no tethering. b) You are aware that you're contradicting yourself in the same sensense? 4K 60Fps video bitrate is ~20-40 MiB/s which gives an average movie the size of about 72GiB. so by your definition watching a movie in good quality is OK as long as you don't watch more than 3 of them in a month. c) how is using mobile data that you paid for - stupid? If there are caps - announce them and make it impossible to go over them instead of shaming people who actually decide to take you up on your offer. d) tethering has not been an extra charge until telcos understood that they could charge extra for it (just like them toying with idea of charging extra for Instant Messenger traffic, because it undercuts their SMS plans). > It's not hidden. All people have to do is read the TOS. It's all right there. Yet most people just don't want to take the time to do it and then get made about it. Can't blame the carriers for that. Well, carriers are the ones calling their plans "unlimited" and hiding the actual caps either buried deep in the ToS or behind the vague "reasonable usage". So don't blame people for not wanting to wade through pages of legalspeak just to learn that you lied and "unlmited" is just "50Gb and then throttled". Fedup Agreed. The problem is the AMOUNT of data consumed by a given user account - no how it is consumed. If carriers are concerned about individuals abusing their network, then they need to flag those accounts that use an excessive amount of bandwidth - whether it's through tethering or directly on the device itself. I could easily burn through 150GB/mo on my TMO Note 4 w/o tethering simply by leaving my Blue Iris app connected and streaming 24/7. So it's actually very easy to abuse the system without ever turning on the tethering. Ravonus Damitri this guy is a nut ha... I agree with you 100% bro. Ravonus um yes you can fake it... Sure you can't block the traffic... but you sure can make it seem like the traffic is coming from your phone and not being used to tether.. Which is what these apps do.. SMH lol Latheryin If that is what you wish to believe. OK. Android Developer Is the tether solution needed even if you do it using USB ? Fulbring What a stupid move. I pay for the premium for Netflix and I never thought that I might have to cancel my service just because they did this. The only reason why I have root is because of AdAway and TitaniumBackup. I still use the stock OnePlus 3T ROM. Wasn't expecting this at all.... Kinda suck. Will be interesting to see how many customers they lose. Julian Berger Not enough to change it back... 4Ui812 DRM has no place in our lives. I suspect Netflix will have a change of heart within 6 months. Branko Xiaomi phones say bye bye to Netflix. Google go fuck yourselves. Steve_Jobroni Go fucking buy a windows phone. 天地人 Seriously though Windows phones are great. The only problem with them is the lack of applications. Otherwise, it runs great on low-end hardware, has a great UI, the homescreen is innovative, synchronisation with Windows PCs is cool, etc. dukaki Don't forget that you can use the Netflix website on Edge instead of their shitty app, and it streams at full 1080p, even on my L650 with a 720p screen. 天地人 Wait the Netflix application hasn't an option to stream at FHD? dukaki Nope, just 480p like on android. The device has to be "certified" and there are no certified windows phones afaik. The WP app doesn't even have downloads yet, I think. Edit: Just checked, no option to download here but you can on the desktop app. EowynCarter Might end with a visit at the apple store in my case. Windows phone is kind of not supported anymore. Jimk4003 This is Netflix, not Google. Cyber_Akuma Google invented this SafetyNet crap, let anyone use it for any reason (Hell, Pokemon GO of all things started using it), and over the last year have been making it even more and more strict and unforgiving. So no, a HUGE part of the blame does lie on Google for being openly hostile towards rooted users and not giving a damn about them. Jimk4003 There are legitimate reasons to use Safetynet to check the integrity of a device: Android Pay (or banking apps in general) is one example. It isn't necessarily hostility to root users; it's just a reality that Google need to be able to demonstrate to banks or other third parties that their OS is secure, and that people can't bypass built in security safeguards. Netflix need to do the same with the studios they redistribute content for; and they've chosen to use Safetynet to do it. Netflix isn't a human right; you have no inalienable right to root your phone and to use Netflix. Cyber_Akuma Except that not even my own banking app uses SafetyNet, it still has root checking and certain sensitive features are disabled if I am rooted, but not the entire app. Furthermore, it IS hostility to rooted users, because anyone can toss SafetyNet into their app for any reason whatsoever (such as games using it "just because" in case of cheaters... which doesn't even help at all to stop them). Google has been completely unwilling to work out ANY sort of compromise or method that can keep a phone secure without basically tossing rooted users under the bus. Jimk4003 What sort of compromise do you envision? Cyber_Akuma I am saying that they didn't even try. PCs by default obviously allow admin accounts all the time, even as the main user account (as much as that is not recommended) yet can maintain security. Google when they were confronted with people who were hurt by SafetyNet, legitimate users mind you, basically just shrugged them off and didn't even bother considering what could be done to allow the device to remain secure while also having such safeties in place. I mean, all these apps that you can use on your phone, can also be used on a PC, many of them available in either a browser or native app format, yet it remains secure. There is no reason this could not be done with Android, especially considering it used Linux as a base, they are just refusing to even consider it. Jimk4003 Don't you already have that choice? Your phone is sold without root access (i.e. no admin rights), and you can then choose whether or not to root your device and gain elevated privileges. If you do choose to root your device, you will lose access to some Safetynet enabled applications. You can, of course, unroot if necessary. Cyber_Akuma First of all, not all phones are. Especially in non-US countries. Second, it shouldn't have to be a choice. How many PC apps refuse to run under an admin account? Practically none. I shouldn't have to choose between having root access or being able to use a apps that more and more are starting to add this nonsense to them. Third, it's not even just root, even having an unlocked BOOTLOADER now, even if your rom is 100% stock and unrooted, can trip SafetyNet, it didn't used to be that strict. It's ridiculous to claim one should be able to have one or the other, even SafetyNet could have been designed to not be this brokenly strict, but Google had no interest in doing so, and they are rapidly making having root more and more useless while we still have to deal with all the junk they force on your phone from the manufacturer... that you can only remove with root. Jimk4003 Well, it is what it is. You believe you shouldn't have to make a choice, whereas I believe life is all about making choices and living with the outcomes. We seldom get everything we want, and neither Netflix, nor rooting, are inalienable rights. Whether or not you think it should be a choice, it is one; choose what you feel is best for you. Cyber_Akuma That's not even an argument, that's just trying to claim that the status quo should remain for no reason other than it is the status quo. It shouldn't have to be a choice, and arguing that people have to choose between root and having an increasingly less amount of apps just because "it is what it is" is insanity. In fact, it wasn't even the status quo before until Google started pulling this nonsense with SafetyNet a short while ago. That doesn't mean people should just accept it. Jimk4003 It's not an argument, because there is no argument to be had. The reality of the situation is self-evident; you can't have a rooted device and install Netflix via Google Play. Accepting the status quo has nothing to do with it; it's simply acknowledging reality. You have to choose what's more important to you; Netflix or rooting your phone. Finding the reality frustrating, as you clearly do, won't make it any less real. If this was a serious discussion on human rights; censorship, migration, justice, gender equality etc., then it's important in a democracy to be aware of your rights and responsibilities, and challenge the status quo where necessary. But this isn't anything like that. This is two for-profit corporations, Google and Netflix, who provide services to which you have no fundamental right to access, nor any obligation to use. You can choose to pay for their services and accept their terms and conditions, or you can choose not to. You don't get to pick the terms and conditions of the service someone else is providing you; however you are free to not use the service if you don't like the terms and conditions under which they are provided. That's it; it's no simpler or more complicated than that. Ranting on the internet about how unfair you perceive it to be is irrelevant. Again, it is what it is. Cyber_Akuma Again, there is no "it is what it is" argument. There should be no choice, PERIOD. You are basically saying that people should not complain about this just because "it is what it is". No, it is NOT what it is, it should NOT BE what it is, and people can and WILL complain that it SHOULD NOT be what it is. You aren't even making any rational arguments anymore, just re-stating what the current situation is and then basically claiming that people should not want or expect better. Jimk4003 You can want or expect better if you like. Netflix, like every other for-profit enterprise in a capitalist system, will either succeed or fail based on its ability to turn a profit. Right now, Netflix is turning a profit, and clearly thinks it can be more profitable by excluding rooted users whose theoretical ability to circumvent DRM restrictions may impact its ability to secure rights to new content. Clearly you disagree with their stance, and the only way to see for sure if your disagreement is warranted is to watch their financial performance from here on out. None of the above changes the fact that you aren't entitled to Netflix. You've chosen to root your phone, and Netflix have recently chosen to exclude rooted users. That leaves you with a choice to make. Even if you think that choice is unfair, even if you think you should be able to have both. The reality is you can't have both, and you will have to choose. Again, Netflix isn't a right. Go elsewhere if you disagree with their business practices; that's how capitalism works. Beyond that, you're just having a spat with reality; and that's a tough fight to win ;) Cyber_Akuma Actually, what do you think would lose them more profits, the theoretical minority OF a minority that MIGHT rip movies on their phones (which still requires a Netflix account in the first place) or blocking that 25% minority? Also, drop this "right" nonsense. No, seriously, drop it right now. People are paying for a Netflix account, they DO have a right to get the service they paid for. Netflix made zero warning or mention of this impending block, they pulled it out of nowhere for paying customers. So sorry, but they DO have a right to the service, since they are paying for it. Sony was found to be legally in the wrong when they removed the OtherOS feature from the PS3, because why? Because people PAID for the console when it had that feature, they DID have a right to what they paid for. You're just having a spat with arguing for argument's sake when you don't even have an argument. Jimk4003 There is no argument; it's the reality of the situation. Netflix have implemented DRM controls that block access to the Netflix app via the Play Store on rooted devices. I do understand why Netflix want to tighten their DRM procedures, and I do understand why some people have been left frustrated by this change. The reality is, however, if you want to download the Netflix app via Google Play, you will need an un-rooted phone; such as the phones used by the majority of Android users. That's all that's happening. I get that you don't like it. But stamping your foot and shouting 'no fair, no fair' achieves nothing. Netflix are entitled to run their business how they see fit within the law; and consumers get to choose whether they want to give Netflix their business or not. That's all there is to it. Don't like the way Netflix do business; don't give Netflix your money. Cyber_Akuma All you are doing with the "it is what it is" argument is just repeating what the article is saying. That is not conductive to anything. Anyone who has read the article knows what is happening right now. And sorry, but you are doing the same stamping your foot with the "well, it is what it is" argument. Not to mention that you are also wrong, because over the last 5 or so years ALONE there have been dozens of examples of consumers speaking out against policies or DRM and the companies begin forced to reverse it from the backlash. So you are doing nothing but hurting legitimate users by trying to argue "it is what it is". And again, no, they are not entitled to run their business in a way that without warning locks customers out of what they paid for, Sony tried this... and got in legal trouble and lost. So sorry, but you are wrong, and you have been nothing but wrong this entire argument. Netflix isn't' "entitled" to do this, people DO have a reason to complain, there IS a reason to complain, complaining HAS changed such practices before, and all you are doing is further hurting legitimate users by attempting to insist the "it is what it is" non-argument. Your entire argument has been fundamentally wrong from the start. Jimk4003 It's not my argument; it's simply Netflix's position. I get you don't agree with it, but it's totally valid for Netflix to wish to strengthen their DRM procedures. You do know I'm not responsible for Netflix's decision making, right? It is what it is; I wouldn't get too upset about it. Cyber_Akuma Again, "it is what it is" is not a valid argument. Jimk4003 No it's not an argument. Again, there is no argument necessary; the reality of the situation is self-evident, and no amount of arguing here will change it. The fact is this; YOU rooted your phone. You weren't forced. You should have known that by rooting your phone you are modifying the device beyond its factory specification. You should have known that this essentially makes you responsible for the proper operation of the device; you no longer have the device manufacturer or Google to turn to when software that you have modified doesn't work as expected. You should also have known that rooting prevents a device from complying with the compatibility test suite, and that this can affect your devices ability to function correctly. You should have been aware of the SafetyNet API, and anticipated the fact that this API would be adopted more and more broadly as Google promoted its usage. You can't blame Google for this; as before, once you modify your device beyond its factory spec, you're responsible for supporting yourself. Rooting a device is at the owners risk. You've now found yourself in a situation where a modification you have made to your device prevents you from accessing a service you want to use. That's on you; no-one made you modify your device, no-one said they would take responsibility for the changes you have made to your device, and rooted users are expected to assume liability for any ramifications and complications they face as a result of their decision to modifying their device. Netflix are well within their rights to enforce DRM on their product by using the SafetyNet API provided by Google, and the Google documentation clearly states rooted devices will fail the CTS check. This documentation is publicly available. You went ahead and rooted your device anyway. That's on you. It's no-one elses job to make sense of the decisions you have taken. You're free to carry on using Netflix if you return your device to a state where the integrity of the device can be verified. Or you're free to carry on using a rooted device and living with the compromises that entails. Your choice. Cyber_Akuma I don't think you get it. All you are doing is parroting what the article is saying. Furthermore, despite there being plenty of examples of complaining doing EXACTLY what you claim it cannot do, that is to change such decisions, you keep repeating that "complaining will do nothing". You are a broken record, arguing the same "it is what it is" argument over and over so you can avoid actually thinking. An argument (and yes, no matter how much YOU stomp your feet that it is not, it IS an argument) that has already been disproven over and over and over. You also ignored that there are many countries where phones are already sold rooted, or how such things don't effect using such services on a PC with admin rights which are the same thing, or the dozens of other holes in your logic large enough to sail a ship through. There is no "you should have been aware" because this is a total lapse in common sense and my device is in no way incompatible from a hardware or software level, but rather, the app is purposely rejecting it. Furthermore, they made no prior warning whatsoever. This is like arguing "you should have known modern cars could be remotely disabled" if a dealership decides to just disable all cars with an aftermarket radio installed. I don't know where to even begin with all the broken wrong logic in that last post. Why are you even here if you couldn't care less? You are free to carry on being a living example of "First they came", but don't come crying about how nobody else is listening to you because you could not possibly be any more wrong. I DO have a right to use Netflix on my device, rooted or no, if I am paying for it. If you argue against this, you are wrong. People DO have a right to root their devices, if you argue against this, you are wrong. People DO have a right (and have many many MANY times in the past) to challenge the "it is what it is" status quo, if you argue against this, you are wrong. And I know you WILL argue against this, which will mean that, see above, you are wrong. I have been more than patient with your insane thick-headnedness. At this point I can't tell if you are being willfully ignorant or really are just that ignorant. Or just trolling, that is an option as well. There is no way anyone rational at this point can continue to argue the insanity that you have argued. Jimk4003 I interpret personal insults as an indicator that the individual making them no longer has any faith in their actual arguments, and so I think it's time to call time on this particular discussion. As you've pointed out, neither of us is getting anywhere. It's been fun, but once it starts getting abusive, the fun has to stop. It's a shame, because DRM Vs individual user rights has the potential to be a really interesting discussion topic. I hope you get what you're after; and that the reality of the situation will change to be more in line with what you think it should be. Unfortunately I imagine the situation regarding DRM and rooted devices will only get more restrictive going forward. Take care. Cyber_Akuma You purposely instigate people into losing their patience with you, and then claim "I win because you got angry", especially when the anger is because you were refusing to understand the entire argument throughout this entire mess. My1 even if you dont have any right to access netflix, the whole point of netflix and others is making it easier to use those than to do piracy but when netflix goes around branding the rooted users as pirates and blocking them, they sure arent helping their purpose. especially if netflix is (I dont have it so I didnt try) runs on VGA and DVI Screens (no HDCP) where you can just capture the stuff. I mean it's say same withz Bluray Playback on PC, in addition to needing a Bluray Drive, you need an HDCP Compliant Graphics card, bus encryption, and HDCP compliant Monitor, and not to forget You Piece of PowerDVD which you have to upgrade (aka buy again) every few years because the older versions dont get Key Updates. and then we have stuff like unskippable trailers and all the other bluntly said Bullshit when dealing with that. of course Piracy is easier, just download the file and play it on any device you want, no internet and nothing required and no problems. My1 and even if one piece of software wont run in an Admin account, with LUA even on Admin they arent having and privileges unless you kick in the UAC, and to top it, even if the app wont be running if I force it as admin, and only runs with active LUA concept, I can still run anything else as admin and screw the other software running as normal user over (cheatengine is the perfect example for this) Richard Markert Root is, by definition, unsecure. Any time you have userland processes that have access to ring0 you are inherently unsecure, as there are no restrictions placed upon running code at that point. Cyber_Akuma And yet, there are ways to run it securely on PCs. Netflix and online banking would not be available on PCs if it wasn't. My1 well but from another side, root can also be used to just patch any holes that were there. actually happened a few times before. My1 banking apps dont have a reason for a root check if they are done properly, i.e. TANs are generated with an air-gapped extra device. TANs on the phone are in general not safe and if the TAN is able to be generated offline, someone could use an exploit to root, steal the secret for TAN generation and boom, it's over. and dont even start thinking about sms-TAN, it's even worse. also when I just want to look into what my account is doing, I am not happy when I cant do so. My Bank (Hypovereinsbank) more or less recently blocked root and well I just RootCloaked that thing into oblivion and can do my stuff. but I'll probably change anyway since they sadly have no good way of TANs (just paper-based list-TANs, SMS and app) TedPhillips mostly agree. by providing a turn-key 'lockdown' check, and further by ret-conning it into playstore access (let's see how far they take that) -google is now openly hostile to anyone who bought into android for it's ability to customize and truly 'own' your own device. the open source roots of android was a big differentiator vs something like iOS, but now that they have dominate market position - they are walking away from that without concern. (only worrying about how slow they need to boil the frog to get away with it) meanwhile, what middle manager is going to say 'no' to adding safetyNet checks in their app or play store listing? it is an easy way for them to write down on potential risks, unjustified (which it pretty much always is) or not. blindexecutioner So the solution is to install from outside the play store. That's great for security. Way to go. Richard Markert No they don't. Since Windows 7, new and default users are not Admin accounts. koiulpoi Sorry, this is absolutely wrong. The first user created on a Windows PC has full administrative access, limited by UAC. You can still delete System32, it's just mildly harder than it used to be. If "new and default users" were not Admin accounts, they couldn't install software, so... Richard Markert Default user accounts are higher than Limited accounts, but not as high as Admin accounts. That's why they can install software. Linux users are not admins but can still install software, right? It started on Windows 7, expanded in 8/8.1 and now in Windows 10 a user account behaves just like a user account in Linux. It has no access to %systemdir% unless you manually go in the folder properties and give your user account Admin permissions to it. You can still run things AS admin by giving the permission at runtime, but since all that requires is pressing a button (if your built-in admin account isn't passworded, which it isn't by default, one step forward two back, sigh) and most users are too "stupid" to simply not press that button. koiulpoi It's really funny when people speak authoritatively about something they're so wrong about. The first account created by the Windows OOBE is automatically added to the Administrators group. This means they're an Administrator. They have Administrative privileges. The fact that certain actions are blocked until you click "yes" on a simple UAC prompt doesn't stop this; they're in "Admin Approval Mode", which can be disabled via GPO if you care to. If you buy a computer from Dell (example), set it up, then go to System32 and start deleting .dll files, it'll ask for administrative privileges, but you can click yes and away it goes! Some files are protected at "SYSTEM" level, which is higher than administrator, but DEFAULT USERS ARE ADMINISTRATORS. This has ABSOLUTELY nothing to do with the "password" on the built-in "Administrator" account. That account is disabled out-of-the-box. Please, you're digging a bigger hole trying to look "right". How to prove this: Set up a new computer. Set up user default for MS. Start -> Run -> netplwiz -> Be amazed that your user is part of the group "Administrators". TechGuy22 Haha kodi Doesn't matter to me I Stopped paying for Netflix long time ago. C64 Haha Teranium TV 😎 TechGuy22 I like that too. You can even get the mod one and remove the ads. Lol C64 I know, i always use those. I want to pay for the dev, but there's no option to do that. Koko time is coming with a big update to tim242 Thief. Renato Santos This is stupid. Congratulations, Netflix. Jan-Lk Else It is also getting more and more necessary to unlock / root devices due to missing updates etc. But I'm not a Netflix customer and won't become one. C64 Whahaha, this has to be the most retarded move of the year in any category (even Trump can't top this). I'm glad i don't use Old Crap Flix. A Person Hillary, then Netflix. C64 Nope sorry. Since Trump is your president i can't take America serious anymore A Person Timeout, you're not even a US citizen? No interest in your opinion. James F Wow. Just wow. I can't take you seriously either if that's how you treat people. Not cool, man. A Person "Wow, just wow"? When he can vote in our elections I'll take his opinions of our elections seriously. It is highly ill-informed anyhow. Paul Sterling A person wins! Marcelove Timeout, you are a Trump supporter? No interest in your opinion (neither anyone smart in the world). Roy Riddex Just so I'm clear on this, by unlocked are we talking about SIM unlocked? lomsha No no, unlocked bootloader. Roy Riddex Thanks Corbin Davenport Unlocked bootloader. pbergonzi I wonder how long they'll stick with that premise seeing as how much public opinion expressed here is against them. Screw them. Get the APK somewhere else or install magisk and hide your root. Too many people root their devices and have a good reason for doing so and Netflix should not penalize them. Doby Gillis Dude, normal people don't give a fuck about rooted phones. It's just the elitist twats who do it anymore. twiz0r Dude, you're an elitist twat. Richard Markert Most people who root seem to be. The sentiment among rooters is "if you don't root your phone, you're not as good as me and don't deserve to have a phone. Root you stupid noob!" twiz0r thanks for confirming your twatness. good day. C64 One word ..... Bullshit Corey Kinard I've yet to see that... Maybe you just feel like that because they do in fact know more than you? Richard Markert My first version of Android was 1.5. I've seen it for many years. How long have you been in the scene? My1 well at least a rooted phone is objectively better than a non rooted one, but relatively and subjectively speaking, if a non-rooted phone is good enough for someone then let it be so. EowynCarter My phone isn't rooted. And not compatible anymore ! Franco Fassio Unlocked bootloader maybe? EowynCarter Yes. But seam I can't lock it without wipe. So screw you Netflix. Marcelove Let me guess, your profile pic is that right? https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/0f0c4f3e3ce40074aebfe58d80511d4a0b7d4a94896ce54d82e448a1cd2e3ceb.jpg bruce lancaster Dude. It isn't just rooted phones - Also unlocked. Elitists get their iphones and galaxy s8s from att and verizon. Normal people get their devices from amazon, ebay, newegg, gearbest etc. Jimk4003 I'm sure Netflix are terrified that the tiny fraction of Android users who come to this site, and the similarly tiny fraction who root their phones, are bothered. The rest of the world won't care. bruce lancaster An article in Wireless Week (cellphone industry rag) a couple of months back says it's now a majority of phones in Asia that are unlocked and Europe is getting pretty close to 50/50. US passed 30% unlocked around Christmas. People aren't getting their phones from ATT, Verizon, etc any more now that they have to pay full retail and don't get a free or heavily discounted flagship device with contract renewal. They are getting them from Amazon, Gearbest, Newegg, etc and moving their sim. If I owned stock in Netflix right now, I'd sell it quick on this news. Everything that isn't already mobile is going mobile. Alienating half the European market and 30% of the US market is asinine. Fedup Yup. Ditched my flagship Samsung phone for a 'budget' Moto G5 Plus that is 100% compatible with all four US carriers (and their dozens of MNVOs). Swapping providers is as easy as changing the sim. And despite the slower spec'ed hardware, the carrier bloat-free Nougat is WAY faster than my TW Galaxy phone - and the battery life is INSANE. C64 Probably 90 % of the people don't know what root is. Almost every person I know owns an Android device, but i'm the only geek who flashes and roots his devices bruce lancaster It isn't just rooted phones but also unlocked phones. Got your phone on amazon? Got it on ebay? Got it from gearbest? Got it from newegg? Yup. No netflix for you without jumping through enough hoops that you'll actually know about rooting by the time you get it done. Fedup Are we conflating a carrier-unlocked vs. bootloader unlocked phone? They are two distinctly different things, and I doubt that having a carrier-unlocked phone (i.e. using a TMO phone on ATT, or VZ on Sprint) has any impact on SafetyNet or Widevine. pbergonzi Judging from the posts here it looks like nobody who roots their phone uses Netflix anyway so I guess it's moot. But the outcry sure did get them a bunch of free publicity. T4rd This is what Magisk is for. Pretty sure if I can still use Android Pay with my rooted 6P, I can still use/update Netflix through the Play Store. Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ Magisk still requires that you unlock your bootloader, which is enough to trigger safety net these days, so that won't work. TechGuy22 You don't know how magisk works do you Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ I understand that Magisk is a great tool for modifying my system without actually modifying it. I understand that there are many modules that allow you to do things like hide root, bypass security modules, skin your system, and plenty of other things. What I don't understand is how you can install magisk without unlocking your bootloader. Back when I originally tried it out with pokemon go, it worked well for a while, but eventually even just having my bootloader unlocked was all it took to throw SafetyNet. If that's not an issue anymore, then great! But maybe say that instead of being snarky. Thomas Gladdines Bootloader can be simply locked after rooting and installing a custom recovery. Edwin O. Lol no You could, but then you can't flash anything with said recovery... So no point Thomas Gladdines LOL the recovery doesn't stop working after a bootloader is locked, only fastboot won't flash images but the recovery can do whatever it wants to, update the rom, edit system files etc. Muzzy996 Well as an example for the Google Pixel: https://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=71901761&postcount=454 In this case all it takes is a kernel that supports Magisk and hides the fact that the bootloader is unlocked, at which point with Magisk Hide enabled all root and SafetyNet checks pass. Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ Excellent. I'll have to look back into this then, last time I used magisk it wasn't as capable, glad to see it's come this far. sbeaulieu Magical Hide is there for that Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ Can Magical Hide hide that my bootloader is unlocked? Serious question, not being sarcastic or snarky as I was below. sbeaulieu It does make the SafetyNet check pass iJeggu Magisk itself doesn't hide an unlocked bootloader it only hides root but must custom roms simply delete the verifiedbootstate -flag which in turn makes safetynet pass even with an unlocked bootloader. Some older devices don't have this flag in their kernels in the first place so safetynet will accept that the flag is missing. Link to the patch that most custom roms (kernels to be specific) have to pass safetynet: https://github.com/sultanxda/android_kernel_oneplus_msm8996/commit/abc05b16bbd33521c2fffaf491c5657a94bfcfc5 https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/5b1ff3f47e32d5f57ddadcd650a5b94725bd4e6242cea92e269f51e988d0d426.png T4rd Except it's working for me right now... jonzey231 This has been happening for a week now. I tweeted it to Ruddock a few days ago. Just didn't put together that it was because I was unlocked. https://twitter.com/jonzey231/status/862122438125072384 steelew Google really needs to start stealing from the root community the way apple takes from the jailbreak community. It feels like rooting is way down except for a few (legal) use cases. If it weren't for visual tweaks & usability tweaks, I would have no need to root (personally). This kind of stuff starts to make rooting unpleasant. I already can't use fingerprint auth in my banking app any more because root. Jesús Cuenca They do. I used rooms for like 8 years maybe? And a lot of the "new features" always come of the rom or root comunity. Right now i use roms, but not root. Marcelove I'm trying to stay indoors, but is complicate... Greenify for example, works at no root devices nowadays... But is way better with root and Xposed... Doze can't compare against Greenify... Maybe at version number 20 root wouldn't be necessary... Sandeep Raghuraman What about the version downloaded from Amazon app store though? Does that work fine? TwoBit Gary It worked, but it is old version without show downloads. Go to apkmirror oculairmedia Interesting move. I flashed a custom ROM on my Nexus 6 because stock was so slow that it was getting unusable, but screw me right ? Atoqir In my country lots of stuff doesn't work on unrooted devices. My bank app, payment app and local cable TV and digicorder app all stopped working. Also s-health doesn't work anymore and soon Netflix. Time to unroot Marcelove "Time to unroot" Sheep. Richard Markert Rooting is insecure. You don't need to access the system partition except to break things. Benjamin Walburn If that were the case then this wouldn't be an issue. Nobody is looking to break their phone. Richard Markert Few people I've talked to online know what they're doing when it comes to root. Most of those end up breaking things. Rooting is far too easy and probably shouldn't exist at all. Benjamin Walburn You could say the same about anything, not just modification of phones. Maybe you shouldn't own a car if you can't fix it yourself, or have kids if you aren't a doctor. Rooting isn't easy, it's made easy by the hard work of other people. It's not up to you what other people do with their property, you have no right to say that they shouldn't. And if someone breaks their phone, what does it have to do with you? It's their hobby and their phone. You're not their daddy. senoredusty Or use Magisk DJMix No need. You could use magisk su hide for the moment. it still passes the safetynet. I too use a banking app that cannot be used on normal root proocess faceless128 "please stop giving us money and use Kodi instead" Sounds like a great business plan! JD For the sake of Kodi's developers don't say Kodi in that context. ericshmerick Hrmm, every time I hear Kodi, I think of pirated content. Guess when people are like "I use Kodi for my 30TB media collection" I stop and wonder how... Yes, ripping a lifetime of DVDs, but nah. Probably piracy. C64 I know a few how really use it legally Powsniffer0110 Yea I use it legally 95% of the time. ErectBipedal nah man, I use Kodi to browse my 30TB of linux isos. Totally legit I swear. Chazz Matthews Torrents are legal too. Just depends on the content. Mike Honestly though, if pirate add-ons wern't available on kodi, 98% of the people using it now would not have even heard of it before. Even bad publicity is good publicity. They are not going to publicly come out and say it, but the add-on's are the only reason they're well known. Andy Roid But kodi makes piracy so easy! Blian Oh god, please stop. Nobody is using Kodi for their DVD rips. Railwayman I rather say Fusion and Exodus et al instead since Kodi is... Kodi and you have to install what you want. The Netflix business plan is for her more people on Exodus, Phoenix and SALTS - not to mention Terrarium TV and MovieBox as well. Kevin Strident Kodi is open source. If Kodi stops wanting to be as useful as it is now, someone will fork it and keep it doing what its users enjoy. cbstryker Kodi is just an open source media player. To watch any pirated content you either need to download it or install an unaffiliated plugin that streams from pirated sources. C64 Next kodi wil have drm build in. So people have to use forks. I stopped using kodi since i found Teranium TV. cbstryker That makes zero sense. Kodi's reason for existing would stop. C64 That's BS my friend, Kodi (xbmc) has started on the original xbox and was made and used as a media player My1 actually it depends on how the build the DRM, if it's made to be only active when you are for example streaming netflix and does nothing for local content, which for sure can be legal (e.g. ripping DVDs in finland is no problem because CSS is not considered an "effective" protection method ever since 2007) although if the DRM would be everywhere it wouldnt be funny. Justin D Same...but with Plex and something else >.> Dany Lol I know right? I was using Kodi more than Netflix anyway so... Dmitry Stepanushkin Xposed + RootCloak or something similar will do it for most of apps for those who need root. So I think not a big problem. Abhishek Saral Not a big problem but a big annoyance. tehboogieman Hmm, rootcloak isn't working for me with netflix m477 No, it won't work. Safetynet always fails if you have closed activated, or if you just have an unlocked bootloader. Sometimes even by just having adb debugging turned on. My1 debugging is a joke right? If it's not WHAT ARE THEY DOING? I mean debugging is a core part of developing and any developer probably has it active m477 I've only seen it working like that once, so it might be an isolated case. Kan☆n MagiskSU and its manager app comes with a very good hider built-in. No Xposed needed. h4rr4r Beyond pointless. Netflix won by being easier than piracy, this threatens to turn back the clock on that. Lexster These companies don't seem to get that most people pirate because it's easier/cheaper than buying what they want. Yes, it's wrong, whatever, the point is streaming services made it easier for people, which outweighed the hassle of pirating it. You're right, this kind of thing is what will get people to start doing it again more. BobButtons If I can't use Netflix on my rooted phone, it's Netflix that'll go, not the root. They're encouraging piracy. YaKillaCJ Exactly. Screw it, I only have Netflix for convenience. This will also have negative impact on many devices and average consumers even if they never unlock or root. A lot don't have Google certification, such as upcoming OEMs. Then theirs beta roms like Xiaomi and OnePlus that run awesome. Marcelove Funny thing: I was about to become a subscriber of Netflix after seeing House of Cards by PirateBay but now through the official channel because I thought that Netflix deserved my money... Look : deservED... But this movie will keep me at PirateBay... Funny thing 2: I have a Moto G5 that I could unlock and root and I didn't it just because I wanna see how things are nowadays without root... And I use a lot of apps that would work better with root (Greenify for example)... So I would be able to use Netflix... And I won't and will stay that way only because this douchebag move... Congratulations Netflix... Funny thing 3: So happy that I waited till House of Cards release to become a subscriber... Netflix should learn something from Frank Underwood... And from Blockbuster... tim242 Yeah, sure you were. Once a thief, always a thief. koiulpoi This is the most untrue statement I've read on this website. Thomas Elephants can fly 天地人 http://gadling.com/2012/06/10/airline-transports-herd-of-african-elephants-photos/ koiulpoi Nice! You matched it. 天地人 Yes, because illegally pirating from huge corperations which constantly attempt to and successfully brainwash people into agenda using various tricks, is somehow bad? You're not supporting the creators of the show, sure. But you're also not supporting the 6 Jewish companies that control 90% of American media. Anyways, with your little money you wouldn't be benefitting anybody. Do you honestly think those Jewish companies are dying to get a hold of your $120 you payed for Netflix this year? Probably not. The creators of the show, are well off anyways. Don't companies pay them to have their content on their platform and pay for their production cost and wages? Then; they've already been payed. I'm not endorsing piracy. It isn't the best thing to do, but I think calling people a "thief" and grouping them with people who have actually stolen things off individuals which mean a lot to the individual and murdered some individuals in the process, is just stupid. It's not the same as 'stealing' bits of 1s and 0s. Again, I'm not endorsing piracy, however there are a lot of good reasons to pirate movies and TV shows. Paul Sterling You're a thief. People leave their families for months to give you works of art. Games, movies, music. You can't throw them a few bucks? I'm legit, always will be. Also, tax helps everyone. Your wall of text is just trying to convince yourself, thief. 天地人 Nope. A thief is different from a pirate, besides, they've already been payed. And I was talking about TV shows and movies, but you're too dense to realise it. jj14x Not the same. If I spend time writing code for software, and decide to sell a monthly license instead of a perpetual license, that is my choice. Your choice should be to either subscribe to the monthly license, or to find a competitor software to use instead. Choosing to bypass the licensing checks makes you a thief (taking something without the owner's permission makes you a thief). And same logic applies to TV shows/movies. If you want to own the movie and watch it whenever you want it, BUY it. "illegally pirating from huge corperations which constantly attempt to and successfully brainwash people into agenda using various tricks, is somehow bad?"<-- YES - it is still illegal. Just because somebody stole your car doesn't mean you can go and steal that person's car in retaliation. There are laws and procedures on how to handle that. STDog Illegal != bad, legal != good. Thousands of unjust laws have been passed. They made actions illegal that were not bad. My1 well yeah if you actually bypass the thing you are a pirate (not a thief because stealing != illegal copy) but branding people pirates and making the software refuse if something that MIGHT be used for piracy is on the device isnt not better. Richard Markert It's trickle-down, man. Think about if everybody thought like you. Netflix has 100 million subs and each pay at the minimum $107/yr and that's 10.7 billion. Now if that 10.7 billion were wiped out in an instant, how is Netflix going to make new shows or seasons of existing shows? It's the same with the rest of the content creation business. You and me, we're just a drop in the bucket when it comes to their revenue, but instead of scooping it out a spoonful at a time while adding water by the cup, somebody dumped the bucket over, there would be no money left to pay the content creators before content is even made. Railwayman I guess you like DRM and proprietary vendor lock in? The only moral of the story is: Pay for legit services then and watch posted content - the creators get paid and you get proper content without restrictions. The day the industry realize that DRM, geo blocking and so forth are counter productive will be historic. My1 well I would and I do give my money for legal media consumption when possible but when some things have region locks, meaning I cant import them or other stupid Ideas like Netflix not doing rooted devices, I certainly wouldnt like giving money for something I cant use. My1 not really. I have streamed and/or downloaded stuff in the past (coz not available here) just to buy their blurays years after when it finally came to germany Fedup Love my Moto G5 Plus. Best phone I've had so far - and that's coming from a number of Samsung flagship phones. It's so much snappier and the battery life is insane. I waited a full 48 hours before caving and unlocking/rooting. Haven't looked back. I hate ads, and w/o root, you can't miracast to anything other than chromecast. Trysta Noticed this a little while ago. The crazy thing is I'm not even rooted or interested in any mods. I needed to sideload the latest version 7.1.2 because my RMA Nexus 6p refused to update on its own. I'm keeping the bootloader unlocked so I can recover if my phone boot loops. I rarely use Netflix on my phone but this is kind of annoying. I suspect this has something to do with offline movie watching (which is amazing). jj14x You don't need to unlock bootloader to sideload the full OTA images that Google publishes on their website. Tim Harman But you do need it to recover in your phone bootloops, as he said. jj14x True, but by that logic, everyone should keep their phone's bootloader unlocked all the time (because a bootloop, in theory, could happen to anyone/anytime) - not just when flashing a factory image. My1 but doesnt the actual unlock wipe everything? EowynCarter You don't ? Had to when installing a developper preview. Then I left it that way, so I won't be locked out in case of boot loop. TedPhillips or when you have some random block on disk get corrupted, ala nexus 9. ilovetesla Dumbest blocking I've ever heard Bruce Wayne I stopped rooting ages ago. Android has gotten so good that I don't need it anymore. Muzzy996 Good for you! Not everyone feels the same though, I know I sure don't. Tasker, Adaway, Greenify, Titanium, Substratum and GMD Gesture Controls are all more important to me than Netflix. The day Netflix stops working on my rooted devices (which are what I watch it on, not my TV) is the day I'll cancel my service. No big loss compared to losing root. Richard Markert Tasker is interesting but never felt the need for it. Adaway, titanium are both irrelevant on my S7, I despise gestures beyond simple swiping in the Cardinal directions, and if stock Android is so perfect why do you need to theme it? C64 I have a s7 edge and the stockrom is full of bloatware from Microsoft, Sansung and Google. More than 20 useless apps are included. So yes the s7 needed root. tim242 Wrong. Package Disabler, no root required. Richard Markert No, it doesn't. Everything not necessary for function is disableable. C64 You can't disable everything Muzzy996 Never said android is perfect, if it was there wouldn't be any competition in the market or users such as myself who feel the need to customize Android. Root is not something I push onto others, its just something that I want on my devices and I make choices about what services I use or devices I purchase based upon my ability to do it. Railwayman I take that you like ads, then? Using a non-rooted Samsung without Taller would be like using a feature phone again but with ads. Having an automated device without ads and bloat is certainly a basic requirement to me. Richard Markert Adhell and Disconnect pro. What's an ad? Railwayman I don't see any ads on my Ericsson GF388 either. Don't have to install a single piece of software in order to get there. Ericsson win, Samsung loose.:) Your Samsung still has Google ad services and so forth running even if you are blocking them on the "non root level". My devices are completely ad free with Google ads disabled system wide and in all apps. Samsung loose every time even if their followers are trying to find different "non root methods" to "solve" things that other devices do without any issues due to... root. kostas110 maybe if you use some 500+ euro smartphone from 2016-2017 something that not everyone can do C64 I disagree, Android is one big advertising if you don't use root. Apps have ads (not every app has a pro version), internet browsing sucks without Adaway (build in ad blockers in browsers aren't great), YouTube really sucks if it isn't modded (watch a 30 second ad for a 3 minute movie). And devices are full of bloatware that can't be removed without root. Even the Google stuff are bloatware (kiosk, movies,music,books etc). I also like to remove alot of system apps and replace them with my own apps that i prefer (file manager, agenda, email, music/ video player) and i really hate duplicate apps on my devices. Also Titanium Backup is important to me. So Android​ without root isn't Android for me. jetscreamer01 I use adguard to block stupid ads in my apps. Now using any commercial apps is enjoyable. Richard Markert Samsung's Internet has the Adblock extension and it literally blocks everything. I also use Disconnect Pro and Adhell for system-wide ad blocking. Titanium Backup I never really used even back when I was rooting phones - it has been replaced 100% by Smart Switch. But then, I haven't needed to restore a backup (except for switching devices) in years, probably because I don't run janky community junkroms. Muzzy996 The only reason you feel that Smart Switch completely replaces Titanium is because you never used other features of Titanium that go beyond what Smart Switch is intended for. Things like shortcuts to freeze/defrost apps, multiple version backups or market management are useful to some even if they're on rooted stock OEM ROMs. They're not must haves for the masses though but some of us do appreciate their usefulness. Cyber_Akuma I hate this response. If anything, I have found far more reasons to root than ever before. Being able to create a backup image and install security/tracking software tat can't just be wiped/uninstalled easily is a big one for example. Captain_Invisible But you don't even need to root to get blocked. Just using a custom ROM or having an unlocked bootloader triggers it.. DJMix I really couldn't understand these kind of stupid moves. I mean I kinda get for an Android Pay or some banking apps to implement these limitations. But seriously, a frickin' streaming app? Afraid they're gonna get pirated? For someone who's going to pirate, they probably could just probably reverse engineer the apk and remove the limitations or basically use older apps. Do they really have some idle engineers that they're forced to implement useless feature? ddevito Guess I'll just pirate it all soon. Their loss. JD Fuck Android If OEMs would fucking provide updates for 5 years I wouldn't need to unlock my bootloader. I'm out. I'll come back when Google fixes this shit. Also fuck Netflix. Back to pirating it is. Christopher Bement My app stopped working on my N7 when I sideloaded 5.0. Got an error when trying to play anything. I went and dropped it back to stock on the latest patch and relocked the bootloader. All working fine now. Too fucking bad, Nougat is fantastic on that device, leaps and bounds better than Marshmallow. tehboogieman Which ROM and which N7 do you have? I still have the stock ROM on my 2013 N7 LTE and have been procrastinating loading an N ROM on it Christopher Bement 2013 LTE version and I was using Nitrogen OS (fantastic and stable ROM). I am now on the latest Marshmallow just so that Netflix will work. tehboogieman As long as I can side load it and sign in I'm still ok. It's a pain, but I'd live with that. But if NF blocks root users from signing in, I'm definitely cancelling and just use one of the very easy pirate apps. Fedup As long as you can side load... Sure. But going from "hidden app in the Play store" to "sideloaded app won't run" is probably on the menu. Wayne Randall I just signed up for Netflix so I could cancel it. I'm part of the group. tim242 You paid them... Richard Markert Hahahahahaha I don't even use Netflix on my phone (screen is too small) so I don't care. But man, the tears and butthurt from the root community is hilarious. Benjamin Walburn You're a very petty child. Richard Markert When something makes me laugh, I point it out. I do that even have a dog in this hunt. I only watch Netflix on my 75" LED TV. I'm just tired of root users smugness. Almost as smug as apple users. Benjamin Walburn You're tired of people being smug in their hobbies, so you gloat about the problems inflicted on them pointlessly? Petty and a hypocrite. Richard Markert What else am I supposed to do to remove the smugness? My name is…. Get a life maybe? Benjamin Walburn Why should you? Is another person's happiness really that painful for you? You already know that they accomplished nothing more than "successfully followed instructions." It seems like your purpose would be better served by targeting that, not just being a jerk. Humbling them is one thing, being an ass is another entirely. tim242 You sound like the petty child. Stomp your foot, becauseyou don't get your way. Benjamin Walburn Not only am I not doing that, I'm not not getting my way, and "stomping​ my foot" is not an example of pettiness. Your wrongness-density is impressive. My name is…. Who beat you as a child? Richard Markert Lol koiulpoi You're on androidpolice.com... making fun of the root community... and unable to see past the end of your nose... Don't you have anything better to do? Richard Markert Actually, no. I read Android police because they have the best coverage of software. koiulpoi I didn't realize I replied to you twice. You're all over this article, with really, nothing better to do, huh? Richard Markert Yeah, I'm bored. I'm probably done stirring shit up anyway, today is water change day on my fish tanks. lomsha Tard Railwayman Are you one of those Samsung Apologists that argue against root and proudly tell everyone about the perfection known as Grace UX... just to install Package Dsabler Pro because... something disturb all "perfectness" of their system? Trying to be an "anti-social elitist" is like proudly use Simple Finder on a Mac and tell everyone that you don't need the regular Finder.;) Richard Markert I use Samsung, but only because it offers the best mix of software and hardware for me. And package disablers are garbage. Railwayman I avoid Samsung like a plague because of Knox 0x1 Warranty Void, Grace UX (TW...) and pretty ugly hardware not to mention the software design, which looks like a cheap toy, both colors, design and all S-This and S-That they preinstall. Don't forget DT Ignite so the carriers can add their share. It is always amusing when the Samsung Apologist proudly claim how good it is to live without root and how "mature Android has become" when they are talking about a heavily modified fork of it. If Samsung could replace Google Play with Galaxy Apps, they would. The only thing restricting them from further modification is the CTS in order to be able to use Play. An unrooted Samsung running Grace? It would be like having a feature phone again. Way too many annoyances and no way of making it more pleasurable since the whole thing is... Samsung. The only area where there are some reminiscence of Android is under the About box. Samsung is a disgrace not to mention a complete parody on the concept of an Android device. Not to mention their followers who recently "spotted" the bezel less display (introduced by Sharp and LG followed by Xiaomi) because... the S 8 got it AND suddenly made it a "requirement". The most kind thing I can say about that brand is this: Samsung is for the Android device and platform what McDonald's is for the thing called food.;) There are way better devices available. Buying a Samsung is like getting a Big Mac (the difference is that the Big Mac buyers doesn't claim its superiority - while Samsung buyers always try to claim how "superior" their devices are). Richard Markert Everything in your first paragraph is purely subjective. I find the design of the Pixel to be ugly, boring and derivative. AOSP design language doesn't appeal to me. I also think Samsung's software suite is better than Google's. My 935U doesn't have DTIgnite, but my 935V does...as does the Verizon branded V20, Moto Turbo2, etc. DTIgnite is a Verizon thing. Bezel less phones are sexy, for sure. That Sharp device was a Sharp device, and the Xiaomi has a CDMA radio so I could use it on Verizon , but just can't justify buying a thousand dollar device from China. It is stupidly gorgeous though. I use Samsung because I like the software design. I like the functionality of the base is and apps, and I like the S-app suite. I really miss my Note 7, and I'll be swapping up to a Note 8 when it's out. Don't get me wrong, Samsung phones have their negatives - chief among them is the fragile design and the screen edge touch rejection sucks ass. But for me, the positives outweigh the negatives. Other phones have bigger negatives for me. No IP68, no uSD card, no wireless charging, no SAMOLED display. Phone preference are always subjective. Somebody will always have a reason to pick one over another. Tell me, if Samsung is a "parody" of the concept of an Android device, what is your description of the perfect Android device? I'm guessing it's the Pixel. Railwayman Pixel is an ugly iPhone clone. The best Android device so far would be something like a Xiaomi Mi Mix running Resurrection Remix or similar ROM or something like a Mi Max but with perfection added through a Snapdragon 835, 256GB storage plus microSDand 6-8GB RAM paired with a 1440p 6.44" display or even 4K. 5000-6000 mAh battery. My Xiaomi Mi Max is excellent but would be even better with the aforementioned hardware (I can't fault is existing hardware but I am taking about a new model). A keyboard flipcover would be a great accessory as well. There are no device yet worthy of the perfect moniker yet but my Max is the best thing so far in my collection beside the Nokia Communicators and HTC TP2 and HD2 and also the Xperia Z Ultra when I do the holistic judgment. IP68? Sony all the way to me if I really insist. MicroSD? No need for a Samsung in order to get it. Yes, Samsung is a kind of a parody of an Android device die to their heavy modifications, restrictive policies, low price /performance ratio, carrier branding and Knox 0x1 Warranty Void. The upcoming OnePlus 5 looks promising - they usually get their things right. MicroSD on that one as well.;) If Samsung make a device without any BS such as restrictions, carrier links paired with good price / performance ratio I would be interested. Let's call it a Note Pro. What I don't like with Samsung are all Apologists making excuses for their policies. I have nothing against them as a company or production. They can make excellent products but their policies stop them right now. It is too much McDonald's mainstream and too little class at this time. Carrier devices are typically too mainstream than the unlocked ones. My1 well knox flag is annoying but I honestly like my Galaxy Note 4 which is the last good Samsung in my opinion becase anything later either doesnt have microSD, doesnt have a swappable batter or doesnt have both (Galaxy S6 for example) but these are 2 very important things and I really like some parts of the samsung rom, although a lot of other parts (e.g. the launcher) are junk and get replaced instantly, also root makes the thing work as I want. and well many non samsung devices use the on-screen navigation bar, one thing I despise after having a horrible experience on my tablet. and (at least outside of samsung) the fiun goes on with removing the headphone jack which is something on my absolute instant KO list for phones. I dont see the point of a digital sound connection on a phone because sound itself is analog by definition and I think the DAC in a multi-hundred euro device is better than in some cheap headphones. and not to forget the features. samsung had many features WAY earlier than AOSP did, which certainly doesnt make it so much better at least from this viewpoint, although aosp is certainly getting better with every version. but even though I like my note 4 I must say that it is by no means perfect. everything is better and worse than others if you put the right requirements in. MadMartigan What are are you, seven? me me A primary reason to root is to run adblock because Google is way too greedy. So the irony, Google's greed means there's less reason to pay for NetFlix. Let me guess... shall we? Google Play Movies still works right...? Oh yes, so long as Google makes their money.... tim242 I block ads with Adguard. No root required. Mike | Homeless On Wheels People still use Netflix? Bit Torrent is your friend. dizel123 Exactly. Everyone should stop using Netflix. Not sure how I'm gonna get the shows i currently watch on Netflix from bit torrent since they won't be made anymore once Netflix is shut down, but at least I'll have my bit torrent friend tim242 Some people like to do things properly. Railwayman You mean - Do it with DRM? You can't buy whatever device you want because a content provider disagree. You can't use the system you want because a content provider disagree. You can't use the app you want because a content provider disagree. I need a lot of apps, ads and limitations for the so called "proper way" . The "improper way" is Samsung free, ad free and bloat free - and I don't need several apps because I have just one or two streaming apps, one media player, one book reader and so on. Fast and efficient system to boot. I think I prefer to do things "improperly". Richard Markert >The "improper way" is Samsung free, ad free and bloat free - and I don't need several apps because I have just one or two streaming apps, one media player, one book reader and so on. Fast and efficient system to boot. *sigh* I bet you think deleting the APKs from /system actually gives you more space in /data, too. Railwayman Perhaps you can tell me the benefit of having Kindle, Kobo and Nook instead of MoonReader for everything. The benefits of having an uprooted system, Netflix, Hulu and a couple of apps for different cable services instead of having just one media center would also be interesting to know more about. When we are at it: Why would I want to use a 3GB+ Samsung ROM when Resurrection Remix are 600 MB and the G-Apps around 340 MB? Richard Markert I dont use any of those. Phones are too small for media consumption. I don't have any video streaming or playback apps on my phone. Nor do I have book readers, but why wouldnt I want Kindle? It's the only way to access the Amazon library... Oh wait, I forgot, you do that believe in compensating content creators. Resurrection remix, really? If I put that on my S7 edge, I'd be wiping out half the hardware's capabilities in one blow. No Samsung pay, no edge panels, no pro mode camera, no AOD, no game tools, no GearVR. And im sure none of the little things I've come to expect in my UI, like direct calling and sliding a contact to call/txt. But I can move the clock to the other side of the notification shade, woohoo! Oh and does the installer for RR rom repartition the file system? Because if not, /system will still be 3gb, not 600mb. And on top of that, I'm immediately reminded of iOS when I looked at their screenshots. Railwayman So RR looks like iOS? Interesting. It looks like Android with Material Design on my device. I buy Kindle books but send them through a plug-in since the Kindle app pretty much suck in comparison with MoonReader. Sometimes I also buy from Google Play Books and it is also a trip through the plug-in for them and then into the MoonReader library. You see - DRM is a stupidity that must go way unless they create a device wide scheme so any app can authenticate and show or play back the content. I understand that Samsung phones are too small for media consumption. A 6.44-7 inch display is different - it works comfortably without the heft of a 10-12 inch tablet. Small displays below 6-6.3 inches are just too small. So your listed features of your Samsung are hardware? They certainly sound like software to me. Or do you seriously believe that Samsung use co-processors in their device like Commodore did on the Amiga? I can assure you that your Samsung contain standard hardware with a lot of subcontracted components, especially in the US market where they even use Qualcomm CPUs. Samsung Pay? Why would I use an OEM dependent payment system? My credit cards follow a standard, why should I pick myself into a specific device OEM just to pay? It makes no sense. It is like having a car that only runs on Citgo gas or a 4" Visa card requiring different terminals than my 4.5" MasterCard. Mobile payments will be a thing when a standard are in place. Payment systems requiring me to lock myself into a specific OEM just suck. Edge panels? Don't see the need. Don't like Edge displays with their optical side effects. Flat display or just slight roundness on the edges like the BlackBerry PRIV here. Pro Mode Camera? I prefer to have the Open Camera API so any app can get RAW from the sensor and do their thing rather than locking myself into the default camera app. I prefer Camera FV-5 or A Better Camera etc. The Snap Camera is good too. Always on display? Can set it up on my device but don't see the need when there are things such as Active Display and a lot of other options. Game tools? I don't see any problems with gaming on other Android versions so I just don't see what Samsung can add in this regard. Gear VR? Why would I want to strap my device to my face when there are dedicated VR headsets available for gaming consoles and computers? I certainly prefer to have a full headset rather than using my device as one. Call features? They could be good but carrier calling is old fashioned. I use Google Voice instead and wouldn't consider going back to carrier talk and text. Don't see any benefit with having a phone number tied to a carrier of SIM card. Having more than one for different purposes on the same device without SIM dependency is the modern way. I don't know if RR repartition Samsung devices so you have to check XDA. That brand is probably the worst when it comes to ROMs anyway and a lot of my dislike of them are related to that particular issue. Samsung is nothing more than the Big Mac of Android devices and no Gear VR or Samsung Pay (it is like having a McDonald's Pay) really change anything. A mainstream device with mainstream design with too many round edges and corners not to say fragile, batteries that wear out fast due to lower quality and fast charge (which stresses the cells heavily), a software design looking "something" , bloat ware, carrier BS such as bloat ware and also the price model, Knox and root/ROM restrictions, locked bootloadern - the list goes on and on. Mainstream degenerated art is what Samsung represents. But I know the existence of people who don't believe in freedom of choice other than the freedom of buying their Samsung from their carrier and then happily oblige and reduction imposed to them all the way down to the SIM card dependent phone number and roaming charges when they travel.;) They also consider Samsung Pay to be the best thing ever - a payment system that only work on a particular OEM. It really is like a car that require Citgo gas and is unable to run on Exxon or Esso fuel. Samsung just are the Big Mac of Android devices. There are just nothing "classy" over such a carrier mainstream brand. If you want to know what luxury are? Look at Vertu. Richard Markert A 7" device is too small. My tablets start at 10" minimum , and go to 12" maximum. Content consumption is unpleasant on anything smaller, and I barely watch anything on a display smaller than one of my 24" computer displays. Yes, you're right almost all of them are software features, but they are locked out when you put a junkrom on there. And Samsung Pay? Well, call me when Android Pay is compatible with magstripe readers. My bank still doesn't support Android Pay that I know of, either. GearVR. How shall I put this? Computer VR is currently overpriced - unless you want to go ahead and buy me a $600 headset, a pair of controllers @ $130 each, AND you still need to buy me a $1400 PC to run VR titles at an acceptable framerate, because while my laptop can still run AAA titles at high framerates and 1080p, it can't do VR that good. My GearVR cost me $50, it's a convenience thing, every VR title is locked 60fps, the graphics are "good enough" and I can even take calls from VR with my Bluetooth headphones. I don't care about Google Voice. Or any sort of data-based calling. US data networks are still too unstable and limited. I am pretty much guaranteed to be able to make a call anywhere I can see at least the tiniest bit of 1x signal, but if the data network is gone, or you used all your gigabytes, you can't make calls anymore on your preferred number. A lot of these things you say you simply "don't need" them, and that's how I feel about root. And about pretty much everything you care about. I don't do ebooks, I don't do movies or tv, I barely play basic games. I do listen to a LOT of music though, and yes a lot of it was stolen from when I was younger and stupider and didn't understand that without compensation there will be no content. Oh, and BTW, Knox is a good thing. It's how I have system-wide ad blocking without rooting, and how I can have my Secure Folder. You seriously think Vertu phones are luxury? Classy even! Vertu are tacky, garish and gaudy. "Look at how much money I have." Nothing classy about that ugly diamond-crusted turd. Look, I really don't care what your choices are. I'm glad you have the choice to find a device that makes you happy. But you seriously need to stop acting like your choice is the only choice. It's not. And I hope to god it never will be, because at that point, Android will no longer be a platform that fits my needs and I might as well go to Apple. Because you see, what fits my needs, is a device that provides me with everything I have, out of the box, without having to modify it. Samsung does that. They give me everything I want, and nothing I don't. And when the Note 8 comes out, the S-Pen is going to blast it so far ahead that there simply won't be any other phone in the running, not even the S9. I would still have my Note 7 if they would let me. derp_cookies So I agree this is a dumb move but everyone is overreacting by threatening to pirate content. This is a niche problem as less people root now, especially since Android pay won't work when you do it. So Netflix isn't any less accessible than it was before. I watch 99% of Netflix at home on my Roku. Luxferro It's not just rooting. My Nexus 6P is running stock google rom, no root, w/ just unlocked bootloader, and netflix is gone in my play store. Not that I watch TV on my phone... but my shield tv is also unlocked... so it's probably just a matter of time. Roh_Mish Dammit Netflix, you make me want to go popcorn time route. My current primary phone and my iPad are what I use to watch netflix and both of them is stock so i don't have anything to worry about but this just feels wrong. Between this and Amazon not releasing the TV app for my sony TV, which they support outside, popcorn time (and in extension piracy) just seems easier. Vivek Rameses This is why we have piracy. Miguel Angel But ...why? occono Distributors want Netflix to stop any possibility of making DRM-Free backups on the content. Railwayman Good luck with that. If it can be played, it can be recorded. As long as the Netflix content is visible somewhere a copy can be recorded so again, good luck with blocking. Mariano Moreira Even more strange is while Netflix app is removed from Playstore, Netflix VR is still.in Playstore. Manually flashing Factory Image for Google Pixel is how I get me OS updates and I choose to leave bootloader unlocked, rather than relocking every month.(which would include full wipe) So I guess they don't care about security for the few users whom might use Netflix VR with Daydream compatible device? tehboogieman I'm not familiar with the Pixel, but almost every Nexus device lets you lock without wiping all your data. Maybe that requires root though, I really don't understand the details on how it works, but hopefully you can find a way to do it. Mariano Moreira To clarify: In order for me to install Factory Image every month, I need to have Bootloader unlocked. Doing the Factory unlock will wipe the device. Locking the device doesn't wipe the device, but Factory unlocking the bootloader will wipe the device. tehboogieman Yeah, sorry I wasn't more specific. I use an app called BootUnlocker. It lets you lock and unlock the bootloader without wiping at will. Since an app can do this, I'm assuming that it can be done via ADB. Also it might only work on older devices, but maybe there's a way to replicate this action on newer devices as well Mariano Moreira I don't understand why Google is promoting Security by having the device fully-locked, yet still relies on ADB fastboot unlock/OEM Unlock commands to flash factory images? saf1927 Why are using factory images when Google provides OTA images too, and these don't require an unlocked bootloader, nor a wipe? jdrch It's not just Netflix. The HDHomeRun Prime app doesn't work on rooted 7.0+ devices either. Jsilvermist Good to know, will no longer recommend Netflix to anyone when I'm asked... James F News flash: when you explain to most normal people why you don't recommend Netflix, they won't care, because it doesn't affect them. D13H4RD2L1V3 This is stupid. I had to root my phone to be able to hide the navbar at any time I want and also to gain better battery management controls and other stuff that I sorely wished Google had added to stock Android way sooner. And I was considering a Netflix subscription. No longer...... Sruly J I know it's not fully a solution which is "worth it", but the app Custom Navigation Bar offers the ability to hide status bar/narbar without root. Although like you said, you had other reasons to root, so... My1 yeah, I do root for theming and stuff, but srsly they literally are throwing oil in the Piracy and DRM discussions with this. Diar I pay for Netflix so I can watch the content any way I want guilt free, whether that's their app or other locations on the Internet. F their VPN blocking and DRM. If they make their app impossible to use, I just won't use it. They'll still get my money but they will lose any data/tracking since I'll still be watching their shows, just outside of their ecosystem. Dummies. ReedSolomon Between the SJW nonsense like Bill Nye, the ipv6 tunnel blocking (rather than simply defaulting to ipv4), increases in price, less and less quality content, and now this, I see little reason to keep paying for Netflix. robogo I understand Netflix' reasons, I really do - they need to protect their property and investment. But I can't really say I understand the way they're doing this. This is a good way to alienate the small percentage of power users who root their devices for various, but perfectly valid and understandable reasons. And no, this will not make me cancel my membership as long as the app works. Cancelling membership is a silly, overblown reaction to what is, in my mind, a minor nuisance. D13H4RD2L1V3 I personally just find it a dumb move. Seems like an easy way out. Dmitri Smirnov > perfectly valid and understandable reasons. And what reason would that be? Preventing people from ripping their content? Doesn't stop them in the slightest, root-detection in circumvented rather easily as well as safety net, we have PokemonGo to thank for that - a lot of people were motivated to crack it and they succeeded. > Cancelling membership is a silly, overblown reaction to what is, in my mind, a minor nuisance. Cancelling membership is valid form of feedback to the company, that trying to tell it's customers that they are not allowed to own their device that they paid their money for, if they want to watch a movie. robogo You misunderstood, it seems. A perfectly valid and understandable reason to root one's device would be, e.g. Xposed framework, theming support, tethering, backing up stuff with Titanium Backup, etc. Please read my comment once again. EowynCarter Well, if and when it stops working on my phone, what will be a major nuisance. robogo Agreed. I'll have to find another way then. But I'll deal with that when the time comes. Manbearpig I member when netflix released there app for Android and they did the same thing. I would just download the app and be good to go. After awhile though I stop rooting I miss it sometimes Cyber_Akuma I warned people when Pokemon GO of all things had a surprise update that silently added SafetyNet that this garbage was going to become more and more common. Mario RUN uses it too, and now Netflix.... soon apps everywhere are going to add SafetyNet and block rooted devices as standard practice. Google has been incredibly hostile towards people who actually want to own or have control over their devices or even their PC Software over the last few years. And over the last year google has been making SafetyNet more and more harsh, now even tripping if your BOOTLOADER is unlocked even if your phone is not rooted. Pokemon GO and Mario RUN were a small crowd, but I hope after Netflix of all things starts using it (and make no mistake, this is just the beginning) that people will finally push back against Google's hostility towards rooted users. EowynCarter Yeah. Or I might seriously consider going the iOS way. Though iOS would pose other problems. (Bye paylib) BillPosters I rooted my Android phone to get rid of the annoying camera shutter sound, and to prevent apps from stealing my contacts, and to basically take control of my device rather than letting Google run the whole show, and because of that I can't update Netflix? Good riddance Netflix. iKon I'm pretty sure you can go in the camera settings and take of the camera shutter sound?.... .. In some region-specific firmware versions or certain devices you can't do that. Railwayman There is a better solution: Declare the device a DRM free zone and use everything else. DRM to me is "Don't Restrict Me!" and an excellent reason to give certain companies the middle finger telling them to just go and F themselves. The most ironic thing here is that removing Netflix or using DRM otherwise doesn't stop piracy. On the contrary - By buying and using DRM content you get to travel in the cargo hold with no heating while the pirating consumer get first class service: more content, no restrictions, no copyright trailers or ads before the movie start and stop on. Even better: They can use whatever apps or ROMs they want. Would I unroot my device in order to get DRM content onboard? No way!!! If Netflix are so scared - block the client on Mac OS X and Windows et al. Piracy doesn't usually happen with an Android device as a source but rather computers and HDCP rippers. Another thing also to the DRM companies: Everything that can be played back can be recorded! (Good old piracy saying) Netflix out, Fusion with Exodus, SALTS and Phoenix in. Kodi with Rapier skin is much nicer than the Netflix client and Trakt integration make this way a much better one than going down the DRM route, sitting with an uprooted stock ROM and Netflix.;) TechJunkie198 ? netflix isn't scared. the studios require the drm. and netflix isn't concerned with the small percent of users who root their devices. Railwayman Doesn't matter. Go and enjoy your DRM services.;) DRM is a pest and that is why the pirating community offer a superior product. It is easier and more hassle free to just put Netflix where they belong and use Exodus et al or MovieBox or Terrarium TV and so on. To those who now consider unrooting because of Netflix: Just don't - use other services instead. Richard Markert So when everybody takes your advice and uses a service that doesn't compensate anybody in the content creation business, and all the high-quality media is gone, don't go crying about there being nothing good to steal anymore, k? Railwayman Even better: DRM and proprietary vendor lock in are scrapped and replaced by standards. If they want some kind of protection - make it device wide and linked to the account signed in so playback works in different apps - only thing needed is to call the system wide authentication system. I am against DRM and vendor restrictions. Original content without any of the BS is what the world need. Piracy is a symptom of several problematic things such as geo restrictions, root restrictions and the failed idea of the "right of no distribution" - i.e. the content exist but stubborn companies deny distribution using silly arguments. I always remove DRM from purchased content in order to have full control including the basic right of using whatever app or equipment for playback. Richard Markert Start developing the solution, and start a content creation company that can compete with the big boys when it comes to quality content. Or, you can sit around and whine online about the content creators not wanting the people who don't follow rules to play in their gated sandbox and get mad when you crawl over the fence. Railwayman I take that you like DRM and proprietary vendor lock-in. It is easy to avoid the gated sandbox so no need to whine. It is easier to just fire up Exodus rather than relocking the bootloader and flashing a stock ROM or remove SuperSU in favor of Magisk just to be able to get Netflix. DRM is such a waste of time. It's not necessary to develop a new service since the content are available DRM free already. Standards for media and books etc does exist or did you miss EPUB, PDF, AAC, MP3, MP4 and so on? Perhaps you prefer such a format as ZNO or Apple modified EPUB that only works with iBooks? saf1927 Magisk seems to do the trick. Helios What about my non-rooted OnePlus One? It's also listed as incompatible.. '-_- 天地人 Don't OnePlus devices run a custom ROM and have unlocked bootloaders? Android Developer How can they block people who root the device from installing the app? The play store doesn't have this filter. Maybe after the install they do this check? Richard Markert If you're really an Android Developer, you would know that SafetyNet is what's doing this "behind the scenes". Android Developer I'm talking about the article. They say that Netflix blocks rooted devices, and I know that this isn't an option on the developer console. Google doesn't have anything related to rooted devices there. Ezio I have about 200 original blu-ray disks, go to cinema, and I'm Netflix subscriber. Now I won't get app updates (or even worse I won't be able to use it in the future) just because I like to use my custom rom. Thank you. This is really a bad move. AdjustedFlow I thought netflix was about providing a better service than piracy. Now they're literally pushing me back to piracy. What the heck? Dany If for "root" they mean administrator privileges, don't we already have that on windows 10? So why Netflix doesn't block desktop version too? P.S. by the way...whatever man! I was using Kodi more than this crap anyway... Miku is Best Vocaloid This means Netflix won't be getting my business anymore. Paul Sterling No worries here, when you're legit. Take my money, I'm not cheap. Give me a service, I'll pay you. I don't need to rob. What am I? 13 living with my mom using Napster? Naw, grew up. Don't have any Tim foil hats. My wallet grew up too. ast00 This is a dick move that could have been avoided. If they want us to pirate their content instead, we will pirate their content. We tried doing it the legal way, but they didn't allow it. Their problem, not ours. EowynCarter Umf. **checks google play ** No longer compatible with my nexus 6 . But nexus 4 still ok. For crying out loud! I'm not rooted or using a custom ROM. Pyramid Power netflix is just losing money. it's saying to those people, 'go to thepiratebay!' RemiV2 I guess I'll just keep torrenting then. Thanks, Netflix. Lawstorant Magisk stan dex 97 new dark web premium links . also included are netfix lifetime membership links as well as graphic Live chat links (use anonymously) https://satoshibox.com/axbr7vnm6ifzk8hwtcreoe28/buy Linus Monie If you are this afraid of someone potentially fiddling around with your code, the problem is not the 'fiddler', it is your code. Netflix is a client app. If I can, with a rooted phone, fake my subscription, or somehow cause a major security issue, that is not a problem with me, that is a problem with you pushing out a vulnerable app to millions of users. Sure, it would be my fault for exploiting it, but there is no-one but you who managed to put the problem in place. A CLIENT app should not be anything but a front-end representation of an API run by your servers. The CLIENT should have nothing but a CLIENT ID to use with the API. The CLIENT should NOT be able to change JACK SHIT with the API, it should only be able to get search results, get access to encrypted streams, etc. If your client CAN change JACK SHIT (which one could assume is true, since you are so actively hiding your code) then you have a major security vulnerability... This is a problem with your code, not anyone's rooted device... Hell, you don't even need a rooted device to access the applications code, just download an APK of the app, extract it, and decompile it... Jesus netflix, get your shit straight you bendy pos... My1 I think their problem is rather that rooted users *might* be able to capture the decrypted stream using root or whatever and they are afraid of that. although on PC you have admin permissions and netflix has no problems iirc. Linus Monie Yeah, exactly, its not like people will prefer to pirate the stream on their phone (at least I wouldn't...), so that was my first thought of why they made this change. Now that I think about it though, its probably not so much of a Netflix decision as it is a licensing issue with one of their "film sources". (can't think of a better word for it rn..) Licensing issues are a bitch when you need to adapt to as many as Netflix has... BahnStormer Netflix is used more on tablets and TV boxes, these tend to be used for several years longer than phones and even Google now only updates their devices for <2 years (Samsung / streamer manufacturer's do this even less!)... We HAVE to run the likes of Lineage if we want the devices to be secure! Bye bye Netflix, even Amazon Video lets us use rooted devices! jcopernicus People don't understand IP and lambast a company protecting it. Of course. My1 I have never tried but if netflix can run over a non-HDCP connection like DVI or VGA, there's literally no reason to use a phone for piracy. RemixedCat well they got rid of 5 star ratings, deleted tons of shows I was in the middle of, and the roku app is hella slow and takes 10 freakin minutes to load (by comparison my OS install from power on to desktop was 8 minutes on my samsung 850 500GB SSD!!) Tobi I'm running LineageOS on my Oneplus One to lengthen the lifespan of my device. Why must I be punished for that? I'm going back to pirating content. StankyChikin Possible that the movie industry is pushing this? SkullOne Shhhhh. Don't use logic here. It's not allowed. It's simply easier to blame Netflix and believe that they have a vendetta against the teeny tiny, itsy bitsy amount of root users out there! StankyChikin Forgive me plz lol username_not_valid This isnt about Netflix, its about its content providers. There is this notion that you can copy files and therefore pirate content if you are rooted. We all know its rubbish, Netflix probably knows its rubbish, but that doesn't change anything. If Netflix wants shows, its has to abide by its license agreements. There is really nothing Netflix, Amazon, Sky or any other streaming service can do about it. The fact that almost all pirate content comes from PCs and HDCP by-pass devices doesnt mean a thing. TedPhillips at least in practice, unlocking your bootloader/being rooted has no impact on your widevine support level. now, i'm not sure if the oem could supply a high-level drm library on a pre-rooted device, due to agreements, but modification after the point of sale is a different matter. meanwhile, keep on streaming netflix on your 'rooted' computer - gasp!~ Richard Markert >meanwhile, keep on streaming netflix on your 'rooted' computer - gasp!~ I don't even need an admin account to steal Netflix on my PC. Since the Windows 10 app and browsers BOTH work over analog, all I need is an inline box with a DSUB VGA connector and simply capture the entire output from the VGA port. My1 or use DVI if possible, even better. Valerie Frye-Preter Did they do this because of the stolen season 5 of Orange is the New Black? TedPhillips wasn't that stolen before it was available for streaming? so i don't see how it could be. TedPhillips when the device can be retroactively uncertified, as safetynet mutates over time, that's a step beyond the usual forced obsolescence of artificially short software support windows. now instead of buying a new phone every 18-24 months, it could be literally whenever they feel like moving the goalposts. Mike Hunt I don't understand. I am a Netflix subscriber, but will probably have to unsubscribe now since I bought a rooted Chinese mediabox for my TV. This sucks, as I liked and supported NetFlix's business model. Richard Markert Which box do you have? Mike Hunt One of these https://www.aliexpress.com/wholesale?catId=0&initiative_id=SB_20170514131212&SearchText=media+box+mini+m8s Brock Reed I'm not even getting the "not compatible" message, it's just not showing up at all. Ajmobileguru First DirecTV Now and now Netflix. I dont see the point. As if rooted users were pirating the streams or movies. Rooted users on non-nexus/pixel devices already were getting only 480p because of widewine crap and now this. Anunnaki This is why people switch to apps like Popcorn Time and Terrarium TV. Biga173rd Popcorn time still works? Anunnaki When I last checked few months ago, it was working. No idea about the current situation though. Biga173rd Okay Erin Andrews Oh that's easy, they block my device I cancel my subscription. Say goodbye to my 15 dollars a month. piggynuts Stopped playing Pokemon, stopped using Snapchat, next to go is Netflix. I refuse to say bye to root. BobButtons Magisk. While some say it's hit and miss with Pokemon GO (idk, I don't play it) it's never not worked for me with Snapchat/Android Pay/Mario Run. cliff_dangers Why does everyone freak out about a rooted phone but my PC which is wide open is not a problem? What makes smartphones so special? Doro Manekia ΝετΦλξ Ανάθεμα σου.Χα χα χα Το Μαααακα. Bewear I am not that upset because I rarely use Netflix on my mobile, I am upset because this kind of blocking will become a trend. BoFiS ugh, fuck you, Netflix, I pay for your serve, LET ME USE IT ON MY PHONE A.M There are some many ways around that LAME NETFLIX - Showbox Kodi Firestick with Kodi I can't see the point of Netflix when we have so MANY better apps out there that kill Netflix ErectBipedal That'll teach them filthy pirates for trying to pay us money!.... wait.... -Netflix probably Zxyon Rhysivz What could users with unlocked/rooted phones do with the Netflix app that other users can't? Loco Mole Netflix content isn't that much better these days, so if they choose to distinguish themselves by being a d*ck to consumers who care about using our devices the way we want to, then f u too, Netflix, I got plenty of other legit streaming content. Fedup Let's see... Piracy: $0.00, no ads, no DRM, no device/location/time restrictions Legit: $$$, ads out the as$, DRM limiting options, shows locked to specific devices, locations, etc. Keep on making the decision easier for us, Netflix. xyz Fortunately, the Pirate Bay is accessible from all devices and regions without any geo-blocking. berserksgangr Well, my Nexus 7 with Lineage it's not working even without root (error 9) Nick Riley This is utterly stupid! Corvus Dove Remember that time that making things more difficult for software and media pirates through DRM while possibly messing with legitimate customers paid off and prevented piracy? Me either. Asbjørn The problem here is that most users root their phone to get the updates that their OEM doesn't want to make available. If Android had proper updates, rooting would not be so necessary. Patel Nisha Root user here. How do I use Magisk for this? I have it installed and new to the Magisk(haven't had a rooted phone in a while)? Keletor Does it stop you from sideloading it? I mean really, if you are rooting your phone you most likely will find a workaround. Luxferro Not yet, but you can be sure the app will stop working in the future. Znuff The download feature is not working for me anymore. And the 5.x app is not working at all, just says I need to install the 4.x one (redirects me to the download page) Tim Get Roku tv or a fire stick cause no issues there and it isn't through Google then Biga173rd People still use Netflix? mlauzon And this is exactly how you piss off your end users! Doug Rogers I guess I'll have to unroot - whoops, Android 4.2 Awesome. Luxferro Don't forget to leave your 1 star review.

The only way I can watch overseas now is using Mediahint.com - nothing else works. Luxferro Just use usenet. They are forcing their legit customers to piracy... DDS This move will not stop people from pirating their content, it will encourage it. Exactly the opposite of what they're trying to achieve. But tell that to the a**hats who control the money... Ubelsteiner And thus, Plex and Kodi become even more popular, as Netflix drives a nail into it's own coffin. Znuff http://i.imgur.com/LG3dXc4.jpg http://i.imgur.com/eNeuPCD.jpg Can not use the latest version on my device, it sends me to download the 4.x version. When I try that, the latest 4.x version has Downloads disabled for me (it used to work on this device). US Patriot No worries. I can live without Netflix, but I will NOT live without full control of my devices and data. Ricardo A. Fragoso For those who want root at all cost there's still a chance to get movies with ChromeCast Support...

Nick Coad I can guarantee you that Netflix doesn't make these choices willingly. The production companies they purchase shows off are notoriously backward when it comes to technology and unfortunately Netflix relies on them to survive. Kevin Davis So I can't update my Netflix app on my unaltered Google Store Pixel XL. FUCK YOU NETFLIX, and goodbye, you SONS OF BITCHES.

Developer Preview 4 of Android Things OS is now available Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/05/16 11:57am PDTMay 16, 2017 15 Plus 1 on G+ 40 Share on Facebook 53 Share on Twitter Total Shares108 Android Things Google News Google officially released Android Things OS last year as a developer preview. If you're not familiar with it, the OS is a lightweight version of Android that maintains support for popular Android developer tools and APIs, like Android Studio and Google Play Services. The developer preview has received a few updates since then, with the last one adding support for the Google Assistant SDK. Now the fourth major version of the Developer preview has been released by Google. The most important new feature is support for the NXP i.MX7D Pico development platform. Connecting to digital audio devices over Inter-IC sound (I2S) now works as well. The Google Assistant SDK first arrived in Developer Preview 3.1 for the Raspberry Pi Voice Kit, but with Preview 4, the SDK should now work on all development boards. Finally, developers can now register additional interfaces with PioDriverManager. Being a developer preview, there are still many known problems, including Google Play Services slowdowns and system power management being completely disabled. Still, if you want to give it a try, you can find more information at the source link below and download the images here.

I'm not sure I want Android on devices that are going to be in my home and relied upon daily and for years to come. Paul thanks for your honesty rivasdiaz I would say that Android Things will be more under Google's control. They seem to imply updates will come directly from Google for all devices. That would be a huge selling point for Android Things. The news about Google creating a standardized interface between vendor and Android OS is also a significant step towards less friction in upgrades. At least they are aware of the problem and are moving in the right direction. Capt4chris This OS seems to be taking quite a while to progress. Suicide_Note Well, then, get to work on it.

Sending Google Play credit gifts seems to have quietly vanished from the Play Store Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/05/16 7:30am PDTMay 16, 2017 8 Plus 1 on G+ 14 Share on Facebook 32 Share on Twitter Total Shares54 News Google added an interesting option for gift giving occasions to the Play Store in late 2015—electronic Google Play gift cards. This feature has been available in the deep recesses of the Play Store ever since... until recently when it seems to have disappeared. Google support is confirming to people it pulled the feature. Indeed, if you go to the Play Store now, the "Send gift" option is no longer in the sidebar. The gift cards were available in $10, $15, $20, $25, $50, and $100 denominations. The gifts were delivered via email, instantly adding your chosen amount to the recipient's balance. According to a support chat provided by a reader, Google removed this feature for "security reasons" in a recent Play Store update. Support suggests you use a third-party retailer, which would still permit you to send a Google Play gift card electronically. Weird, but okay, Google. The support page is supposed to be updated soon to reflect the change. Source: Google Support Thanks: Carson Tags credit gifts google play google play credit google play gift cards subscribe ...

We've written on the topic ourselves in the past. Google has a new project in the works to improve the situation, though. Meet Project Treble. Typical lifecycle of an Android release Currently, Android software updates need to go through three major roadblocks: chipset makers must create new drivers and software packages, device manufacturers must use those drivers in their software packages, and carriers must then add their customizations and release the update (save for carrier-unlocked devices). Project Treble wants to help sort out at least one of those problems. At its core, Project Treble seeks to place a standardized interface between device-specific low-level software (like the kernel and drivers) and the Android OS framework. Google says that Treble will try and create a division between the Android framework and device vendors' software, in much the same way that Android itself is split between system software and third-party apps. What this might mean to end users is that updating the Android operating system won't depend on chipset vendors to issue new device-specific software. Instead, Google can ship a new Android version, and device manufacturers can start working on an update right away and send it—salted to taste—to the carriers. Another potential upshot with Treble is that older devices can be supported for longer. Google says it's working with chipset makers to ensure that the new standardized vendor implementation will continue to be compatible with future Android versions. As an example, Qualcomm typically stops providing new chipset device drivers after two years, leaving OEMs out in the cold. Under the new model, a phone could continue to get system updates long after Qualcomm discontinues its chipset. Although Project Treble looks like it'll have a positive impact on the Android update situation, it's not all roses. Device manufacturers still need to care about issuing the updates, and it's still up to the carriers to push them out. Furthermore, Project Treble is only going to be available for devices that ship with the upcoming Android O. Seeing as many devices on sale now are still stuck with Android 6.0 (Marshmallow), the road ahead looks to be steep.

David Kravets - May 16, 2017 9:26 pm UTC Enlarge David Kravets/Arstechnica reader comments 81 Share this story What do a teleprompter, thermos, hoover, aspirin, and videotape have in common? They were once trademarked but lost their legally protected status because their names became too generic. Google won't be joining that list any time soon. Google defeated a "genericide" lawsuit Tuesday that claimed Google should no longer be trademarked because the word "google" is synonymous to the public with the term "search the Internet." A US federal appeals court sided with Google in a case brought by a man who bought 763 domains with the term "google" in them. The court ruled that Google still retains its trademark even if the term "google" has become known for searching the Internet. One reason is because Google is a search engine and a whole lot more. "Even if we assume that the public uses the verb 'google' in a generic and indiscriminate sense, this tells us nothing about how the public primarily understands the word itself, irrespective of its grammatical function, with regard to Internet search engines," the San Francisco-based 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals ruled. The court noted that trademark loss to genericide occurs when the name has become an "exclusive descriptor" that makes it difficult for competitors to compete unless they use that name. The Google trademark dispute dates to 2012 when a man named Chris Gillespie registered 763 domain names that combined "google" with other words and phrases, including googledonaldtrump.com. Google filed a cybersquatting complaint under the Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy and claimed trademark infringement. Google prevailed, and an arbitration panel ordered the forfeiture of the domains. Gillespie then sued in a bid to invalidate the trademark. According to the American Bar Association, trademarks have many advantages: Registration on either register provides a number of benefits, including: (i) it grants the right to use the registered trademark symbol: ®, (ii) it grants the right to file a trademark infringement lawsuit in federal court and to obtain monetary remedies, including infringer’s profits, damages, costs, and, in some cases, treble damages and attorneys’ fees, (iii) it acts as a bar to the registration of another confusingly similar mark, and (iv) it may serve as the basis for an international trademark application.

Click Frenzy 2017: Here Are The Best Deals [Updated] New Google Maps Update Makes It Even Harder To Get Lost Susmita Baral May 17, 2017, 7:00am ⋅ Filed to:  android google google maps Share When you're travelling through unfamiliar territory, sometimes turn-by-turn navigation just isn't enough. A new design update on Google Maps is here to help you out. Image from César Google quietly rolled out a feature that adds visual cues in the form of Street View images of every road you need to turn on while you're going from Point A to Point B. The update, currently available for Android app users only, is new to the Google Maps app — but it isn't an entirely new concept. Google first integrated Street View, which launched in 2007, with the web version of Maps back in 2008. A camera icon near each direction pulls up a Street View image online. TechCrunch also reports the original Droid had a similar feature. Google Allo's Selfie Stickers Are Cool, But Don't Get Too Excited Fans of Bitmoji. there's a new caricature app that you'll want to see. It's more aesthetically pleasing and a breeze to use, but not so simple to share. Read more How to use the new feature To use the app feature, people don't have to do anything differently. Simply enter your origin location and final destination, as per usual, and have the app map out directions. To the right of each written direction will be a thumbnail image from Street Views, which can be enlarged into a full-screen 360 degree Street View interactive by tapping on the thumbnail. Using your finger to swipe, you can explore the surroundings and get a better idea of where to go. It has its perks and limitations The new feature for the Android app is beneficial for people who struggle to find street names quickly or for anyone who has been a position where they're not 100 per cent sure they're turning on the right street. That said, the feature can be a bit limiting for those driving a vehicle: Going from thumbnail view to full screen requires tapping on the picture whenever you want to see a Street View image in detail. That's a lot of work and attention for someone behind the wheel. There may be room for error As for how useful it is, that depends solely on how up-to-date Google's Street View content is. Areas that undergo development or major changes can potentially be misrepresented in the app if Street View is not swiftly updated, leaving it to a person's judgement to verify their exact location without images. In the end of the day, though, the feature will reduces the odds of your getting lost — and that isn't too shabby.   WATCH MORE: Travel Ideas Comments Be the first to comment on this story!

Google Avoids Genericide, Will Remain A Protected Trademark Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share Google Avoids Genericide, Will Remain A Protected Trademark May 16, 2017 3:58 pm EDT By Mary Beth Quirk@marybethquirk a search engine by any other name google genericide genericization search engines lawsuits “Google” has delayed experiencing the same fate as kerosene, heroin, laundromat, and a number of other brand names that became so popular they died of genericide. That’s the term for when a brand name becomes so widely used that it no longer just refers to the original trademarked brand. RELATED:15 Product Trademarks That Have Become Victims Of Genericization In the case of Google, one could argue that it’s already the only term that many people use for doing an online search. You rarely hear anyone saying “Bing that for me” or “I Yahooed my name the other day to see what came up.” But while one might use “Google” indiscriminately, a federal appeals court has ruled that Google is not yet ready for the genericide slaughterhouse. Back in 2012, two men used a domain name registrar to acquire 763 domain names that combined the word “google” with another brand, like “googledisney.com,” or a person, like “googlebarackobama.net.” Google didn’t like that so much, and filed a complaint requesting that the men transfer the domain names, pursuant to the Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy that is incorporated in the domain name registrar’s Terms of Use, and requires most types of trademark-based domain-name disputes to be resolved by agreement, court action, or arbitration before a registrar will cancel, suspend, or transfer a domain name.” The two man asserted that the Google mark has become generic, and thus, they should be allowed to use domain names that incorporate the word in their business plans. But the UDRP disagreed, and ordered the domain names transferred to Google, noting that the names were confusingly similar to the Google mark, and thus, the men had no rights or legitimate interests in the domain a names, which the panel said were registered and used in bad faith. In response, the men filed a complaint in Arizona federal court seeking the cancellation of two trademarks — Number 2884502 and Number 2806075 — contending that the mark has become generic because a majority of the public understands the word google, when used as a verb, to mean the indiscriminate act of searching on the internet without regard to the search engine used. Google filed counterclaims for trademark dilution, cybersquatting, and unjust enrichment under the Lanham Act, as well as counterclaims for unfair competition and false advertising under California state law. In 2014, U.S. District Judge Stephen M. McNamee ruled in Google’s favor, [PDF], noting that underlying the two men’s argument is “the proposition that verbs, as a matter of law, are incapable of distinguishing one service from another, and can only refer to a category of services.” “This premise is flawed: a trademark performs its statutory function so long as it distinguishes a product or service from those of others and indicates the product’s or service’s source,” McNamee wrote. On Tuesday, the U.S. Court of Appeals In San Francisco upheld that decision [PDF], ruling that the men didn’t present sufficient evidence to show that the general public sees the word “google” as a generic name for internet search engines. The three-judge panel held that “a claim of genericness or ‘genericide,’ where the public appropriates a trademark and uses it as a generic name for particular types of goods or services irrespective of its source, must be made with regard to a particular type of good or service.” The district court was correct to focus on internet search engines rather than the act of searching the internet, the panel said, with U.S. Circuit Judge Richard Tallman writing that “verb use of the word ‘google’ to mean ‘search the internet,’ as opposed to adjective use, did not automatically constitute generic use.” “The mere fact that the public sometimes uses a trademark as the name for a unique product does not immediately render the mark generic,” Tallman noted.

A stew of virtual assistants Google and Amazon are wrestling to be your smart home assistant, and companies like Apple and Microsoft aren't far behind. But you shouldn't commit to just one company. Tyler Lizenby/CNET Smart Home by Ashlee Clark Thompson May 16, 2017 11:31 AM PDT @AshleeEats Enlarge Image The Google Home (right) and the Amazon Echo both want to be your one-and-only smart home hub. Tyler Lizenby/CNET It's appropriate that the CNET Smart Home is located in Louisville, Kentucky -- the concept of the home is a bit like a Kentucky dish called burgoo. This stew is a medley of whatever meat you have on hand (be it beef, pork, chicken, mutton, rabbit or a combination) and some mixture of tomatoes, corn, potatoes, onions and lima beans. You throw your ingredients together in a pot, cook it for hours and boom, there's dinner. Smart home technology might be flashier than a catch-all country stew, but the idea is the same. Companies large and small have rushed to create products that take ordinary household items and connect them to the internet and one another. The sheer quantity of products available means that a smart home isn't much more than a burgoo of plugs, lights, switches, cameras and whatever else you want to buy to piece together a system that works for you. Companies like Google and Amazon have made a case for bringing some order to the smart home mishmash with help from their virtual-assistant-powered smart speakers. The Google Home and Amazon Echo can each be a unifying device that ties together all of these internet-connected devices. They can control smart home devices like thermostats or light bulbs directly, or through other families of products like Wink and SmartThings as well as automation programs like IFTTT. Google and Amazon's approach encourages monogamy in your smart home. Pick a smart home speaker, then outfit the rest of your home based on what devices are compatible to your smart speaker's AI. Turn a smart-home burgoo into bisque. This is the wrong approach, at least right now. More from Google I/O 2017 Google I/O 2017: What to expect Google Home and Assistant one year later: What now? A look back at Google I/O highlights See all Google I/O 2017 news Google is rumored to be expanding the use cases for its Google Assistant, the digital helper that's the brains behind the Google Home smart speaker, at tomorrow's I/O annual developers conference. Google Assistant competes against Amazon's Alexa voice assistant, Apple's Siri and Microsoft's Cortana. Each assistant represents just a sliver of what's possible when you combine artificial intelligence, voice commands and internet-connected devices. But you'd be happier if you used more than one manufacturer's AI and products for your smart home. Yes, it would be great to have a centralized smart home system in which you'd only have to interact with one main device, such as a smart speaker, or a unified interface, like Apple's HomeKit. And there are products that have attempted to be that whole-home solution, such as the custom, expensive Control4 luxury home automation system. But we're still a ways away from the Disney movie fantasy of a smart home that predicts our every move and automatically operates every component of the house. As we've seen at the CNET Smart Home, there isn't a universal system that connects every product to the smart speaker or smart assistant of your choice. We ask Siri to open the shades, Alexa to start a sous-vide water bath and Google Home to walk us through recipes. Though we're seeing more products that work with more than one assistant (just take a look at iDevices), some integrations just work better than others. And there is some freedom in being able to pick and choose the assistant that works best for you and your devices. 18 Here's everything the Google Home can do It can be a headache to have to choose from so many assistants and speakers and platforms. But there's beauty in this stew. The tech giants are scrambling to outdo one another's AI, which means their platforms will keep improving. In the past couple of weeks, Amazon has announced two new iterations of its Echo line of speakers (the Echo Look and the Echo Show) and a Echo-to-Echo call feature. Google has recently added a recipe feature to its Google Assistant, and we expect the company to announce more updates to the AI tomorrow. We still haven't seen the smart speaker that will house Cortana, and a Siri-powered smart speaker is rumored to debut this year. You can pick products that work for you, and bounce from assistant to assistant to get the best use out of them. It would be silly to tie yourself down to just one system when there are updates and new products coming out so frequently. This variety of products will let you build an a-la-carte smart home experience that's more personalized than you would get if you stuck with just one AI. It's OK if you prefer to use Siri to turn the lights on, but you want to tell Google Assistant to play Marvin Gaye through your Google Home. Now is the time to build and embrace your own smart-home burgoo. 21 These smart home gadgets work with both Siri and Alexa Share your voice 0 comments Tags Google I/O 2017 Smart Home Amazon Google Microsoft Apple HomeKit More stories 'Alexa, what did I miss?'

Google may be sued over Nexus 6P early shutdown and bootloop issues Scott Scrivens View All Posts 2017/04/14 11:09am PDTApr 14, 2017 134 Plus 1 on G+ 316 Share on Facebook 84 Share on Twitter Total Shares534 Android OS Legal Marshmallow 6.0 News Nexus 6P The Android hardware space is fast beginning to look like a watered down episode of Suits. Following on from news earlier in the week that LG is facing a bootloop lawsuit regarding several of its phones, Huawei's Nexus 6P could be responsible for Google encountering a similar inconvenience. As well as being accused of the same bootloop problem that has blighted LG devices, there are reports from consumers that the Nexus 6P has a premature battery shutdown problem. We reported late last year that certain Huawei Nexus 6Ps were suffering from the early shutdown problem, causing them to die with as much as 60% battery still indicated. Now, law firm Chimicles & Tikellis LLP is investigating the possibility of bringing a class action lawsuit against Google on behalf of customers who have faced this issue. Also included in any potential suit would be the same bootloop issue that has also affected owners of the LG Nexus 5X. The problems have mostly been reported by users running Android 7.0 Nougat, but there are also claims that backpedalling to Marshmallow 6.0 on the same devices doesn't fix anything. Neither Google nor Huawei seems to be taking either responsibility or action to resolve issues such as these. While Google is aware of the problems, having assigned both the shutdown and bootloop issues in its tracker, its official position is that those affected by the issue should reach out to customer support for a replacement device. But customers going directly to Huawei about the fault are also out of luck, as they are being told that the problem is with the software and not the hardware, and thus not an issue covered by the manufacturer's warranty - whether it's still in date or not. This is a very frustrating situation for the consumer when neither company seems willing to investigate properly or hold their hands up. Let us know in the comments if any of you Nexus 6P owners have experienced either issue. We'll report back with any further developments as they come in.

Thankfully our Ombudsman financially bullies the carrier until we get a resolution in Australia. Got a free refurb replacement, hopefully won't suffer the same. Matthew Hanson Mine seems to love to die around 10%. As a few others have stated, the low power notification will appear, I will use it for a few minutes and then it powers off. The battery history shows this steep cliff falloff after beginning the recharging and power on. Melad360 i always saw my 6p shut off as soon as the power saving mode came on at 15% battery. this started to happen after an update, i think 7.0 or 7.1, never happened before that though Latheryin This really is a software issue with what they ship out to nexus devices. It also effects the nexus 6 from Motorola. Seems every nexus device that got 7.x has this issue. Packer Backer Nope, doesn't affect the Nexus 6. Provide some links or just don't comment. Latheryin Sorry not a baby sitter. Why not do some research before you post. Also might want to look at the source code and try to understand what you are talking about before posting. abrasive I myself did start to see this issue after about a year, but the device was easily replaced for another warranty-related issue. I would assume my clock was started over again. Not that I haven't seen the same problem on computers with old batteries, but I would hope to get substantially more mileage out of a battery. Nexus 6p Issues Its about time! There are so many issues with the Google branded phones, it doesn't make any sense. We have already reached out to the firm to provide any support they need in accomplishing their potential goal of this class action lawsuit. Its time someone sticks up for the consumers who have been ripped off by this multi-billion dollar company. In the mean time, please follow us on Twitter and sign our petition at Change.org regarding this very issue. We have a lot of signatures and would appreciate your's and your share as well. Thank you in advance! 3fren I'm seeing so many comments about the battery issue going away with just replacing it. I guess I have to give it try. I'm always cautious when it comes to replacing a OEM battery with a replica though. Doug The early shutdown has been an issue on my Nexus 6P ever since I upgraded to Android 7. This has been a frustrating experience - I cannot trust the phone to not die on me when I need it and find myself constant carrying an external battery pack so I can start my phone back up if it dies. P. Sherman Just get an iPhone. It has SIGNIFICANTLY LESS DEVASTATING defects and actually functional software Quality Control team. thereasoner Lol, iOS is the worst when it comes to software issues and iPhone hardware is junk. No Google devices have yet to suffer the nightmares that were error 53 and Touch Disease much less the related class action lawsuits against Apple because of them! Are you trying to be funny? P. Sherman Yeah, no Android devices have had to deal with Touch Disease or error 53. Instead, they spontaneously combust (Note 7,) bootloop for no reason at all (ALL LG'S,) have glass backs that pop out when exposed to a little heat (Xperia Z2 and Z3,) have nearly unusable Bluetooth connectivity (Pixel, Xperia Z5,) heat so badly you can cook an egg on it (every Android that had a massive update,)... I could go on! I'm simply stating that iOS has historically been significantly less buggy and disastrous than Android when a new update rolls around (Think the disaster that was KitKat to Lollipop. The transition from iOS 6 to 7 was SIGNIFICANTLY less dramatic than that in terms of bugs and drains.) Also, Have an open mind and stop automagically trashing the iPhone. The iPhone may be lacking significantly in some areas, but it has two significant advantages - USABILITY AND LONGEVITY. thereasoner Correct, any serious issues facing Android phones have been a one off affecting only one model out of dozens of different models/manufacturers while both device bricking issues found in recent iPhones in error 53 and touch disease affected a much smaller base of phones and just one manufacturer . All the other minor issues you mentioned, be they real or exaggerated, are also very similar to minor issues various iPhones have faced as well its just that it's even worse for iPhones because there are so few models from one manufacturer(and they're still worse) vs several dozens models from over a dozen different manufacturers. That's how bad iPhones are when they have more serious issues despite producing so few models. Issues with Android phone should dwarf those of iPhones by a huge margin considering how many models /manufacturers are involved but they don't, the iPhones still manage to be worse! It's mind boggling when you think about but that's how bad Apple quality is these days. Jon Puhl My 6P is absolutely absurd. It shuts down as high up as 51%, and almost always when the battery percentage is lower than 30%. I'm really upset about this, because it's Google's last Nexus flagship, and it can't even last a full two years without having this dumb battery problem. Daniel Orchard I got a full refund for my 6p, and bought a pixel xl, was out of pocket a little for the upgrade but device was just out of warranty so im still happy with the outcome. Props to Google store support. Yeah i still l got charged the pixel while waiting for the refund, took about 2 weeks to come through but they organised the return shipping etc just like an rma. Im actually really happy. Mine would shutdown between 15-30% and i only lived with that for 2 weeks before starting the process of fixing it. Yes it happened after moving to 7.0 and yes rolling back to 6.x did not fix it so im convinced its software, nfi why they havent rolled out a fix yet. I suggest doing the same because all replacement n6p are still vulnerable to the bug afaik. Morenicano Just wanna make sure I follow, You saying you had your 6P for more than a year and they authorized a refund? I ask because I just reached them for an exchange but if I can get a refund and upgrade to the Pixel, I'll do it. Morenicano Just a heads up, JUST I contacted Google through the support tab in the settings of my 6P and they warranty replaced both mine and my wife's 6P and we bought them through Project Fi in November 2015 with no extended warranty. They said it's a known issue and setup the replacement with no problem and it has next (business) day shipping for the new one and you send the old one back once you have the new one up and running. They do put a hold for the value of the phone on your card while they wait for the old one to come back but they don't charge you Cory Wilson Crybabies. Seriously, my phone developed the issue last week, contacted Google, now I'm rocking a brand new Nexus 6p. Luckily I happened to be on the last day of my warranty but I also got protect so even if I was out of warranty I wasn't paying another $500 again. Just call Google instead of your lawyers dumb asses Packer Backer Wow, a snowflake playing Internet tough guy. Brandon Andrews I had my Nexus 6P become bricked by the bootloop issue. I bought my phone through Best buy and was still well within my 1 year manufacturer warranty when the problem occurred. Unfortunately when I called Best buy customer service and asked how to take care of the situation they told me to send it to this company called Jeg & Sons to get the problem reviewed and a replacement. Needless to say there was like a month long ordeal of mix ups with this company before they finally sent my phone back and told me they don't deal with my phone. Finally I eventually figured out I needed to send my phone to Huawei and they replaced my phone no problem. Sarah Despars I've never had this issue with my 6p so far. Hopefully it doesn't start! k_nonymous I experience this exact same problem and it drives me nuts. Battery saver mode on my 6P is supposed to be activated at 15% battery. The phone shuts off before it ever gets to that point. Also, 95% battery life is equivalent to 1h 5m???? Packer Backer Well well, according to thereasoner he thinks it's your fault. gparmar76 This is 100% hardware related...If it was the OS, it would be a widespread issue across all Android 7 handsets...Huawei is using cheap batteries... People who like the phone should go buy a replacement from a company like Zero Lemon (if available)..Or just buy another stock battery. Kirkster My Nexus 6P is 11 months old, and so far the only anomaly I've had is that it spontaneously factory-reset while in my pants pocket about two weeks ago, which was annoying. I recovered from the cloud backup, which restored all my apps, settings, etc, and my photos were set to back up to Google photos. I lost my call log and SMS messages though, but luckily most of my messaging is via WhatsApp (which restored everything). Still, annoying. I now have a SMS+call log app installed in case it happens again. No battery problems *yet*, now I'm dreading the one-year mark, after reading all the comments. Chalet_Badger My 6P bootloops, i can get it to start normally when the battery is ~5% or so but it will freeze and start to bootloop about a minute or two after. Duane I've had no issue with my 6p. Sounds like an annoying issue from the comments here. Robert B I've been having this problem for a few months now...I carry external battery around all the time because you never know when it feels like it's going to shut off and not turn back on Packer Backer According to thereasoner, it's your fault. clarence jones My 6p did not have the random shutdown at a certain percent issue before. After the 7.1.2 update it would crash and restart when the camera app was opened. About two days after the update it started boot looping and nothing i have tried has gotten it to successfully boot again. Packer Backer Tell thereasoner because he thinks it's your fault. Spudos Woah I thought this was just me. My ending battery life varies wildly, sometimes dying at 15% and on bad days dying around 40-50%. I would replace the battery myself but the teardown process looks like it requires an electrical engineering degree. Packer Backer thereasoner thinks it's your fault. Maybe you should straighten him out. Đức Thành Maybe Google deserves to be sued. Kyle Zess I am plagued by this issue. My phone shutdown after 5 minutes of non charging use. Packer Backer thereasoner thinks it's your fault. David Vogt Only time mine would shut down early at 30% or less is if I was out in freezing cold weather, phone just didn't like freezing weather, keep it warm and it's fine blueman24 Just admit it that your "quick charge" bs killed the battery early. Truth hurts huh My Nexus 6p 128 was barely a year old and it never recovered from the bootloop issue where it would keep restarting and not getting past the Google screen then restart over and over, losing precious pictures and videos of my children. My sister's Nexus 5 eventually broke from the bootloop issue 3 months later. We both had the $80 warranty but it seemed unfair having to pay for a replacement REFURBISHED Nexus 6p when the damage was caused by bad software. Sucked how although Nexus/Google/Huwei knew of ongoing repeated problems a 6 -9 months earlier, yet FAILED to try to resolve or prevent the recurring boot loop issue from infecting more phones. Finally, a lawsuit is in place. Damani Boyce After 7.1.1 update my Nexus 6p got bootloop an can't be fixed shame on them not even a reply from Google or Huawei. thereasoner Many on here are saying that they had no problem getting it fixed/replaced. Packer Backer Yeah, it's ALL his fault.... Posts like yours make some people dream of twisting your head off. thereasoner Why would you say it's his fault? Smoking one to many fatties?, Lol. Razed Mine currently dies at around 10%. I use it moderately and have had it since launch. Got Nexus Protect, but that seems worthless as all reports are that using that service will just get me an even worse battery. thereasoner My Pixel has been great, I'll have to ask a friend at work about his 6p to see if he's having issues. By the sounds of it only a small percentage of devices are affected. Packer Backer Nexus 6 by Motorola was a better direction. Gordon Mine would shut off at 25% consistently. I called Huawei and they actually replaced the battery for free. I had to pay for shipping 1 way, but the covered the rest. I got my phone December 2015, and it was just replaced this February. ThEGr33k Which country? Gordon Canada Trey Bradshaw I haven't encountered any bootlooping and my phone doesn't shut off unless my battery drops to about 2%. olivrstal happens to my 6p quite a bit as well :( hope it's gonna make it till the pixel 2 comes out :D mrjoeyloke My wife just got the bootloop of death on her 6p. I think that might be a whole different issue though. Kuldeep Choudhary This happens when a gaint company like google hires a Chinese company to manufacture it's top line product. I'm using my motorola nexus 6 for 2.5 years and still not a single problem im facing and decided to keep it for 1 more year. Omar Al Matar Had the problem, I was out of warranty, called them, no frustration or arguments, 5 minutes i had the email to get my new phone, and i sent them the one i had, i was even out of the country. Now I got it to last me another year, so idk about y'all Kristen Oliver This happened with me until I replaced the battery... At my own cost. Funnily enough that is not a software issue 12321 Please click the links below for details of my experience, which is echoed by thousands of other Nexus 6P owners.

Sue them! Merxury My Nexus 6p died, it stuck at bootloop every time when I turn on my phone. Sara Bales I've had the Huawei Nexus 6P since July of 2016, purchased new in the box. It started randomly shutting down within weeks, often multiple times a day. It was annoying and inconvenient, even shutting down once when I was on a 911 call reporting an intruder in the garage (talk about chaos. . . I had to wait for it to reboot and call again). My phone entered the "boot loop of death" the last week of March. The first 6 or so crashes, it rebooted just fine. But then it started getting hung up on the rainbow google animations, until finally it wouldn't even push past the Google screen. I was able to pull up the barcodes but other system reboots were useless. Since my phone is still under warranty, Huawei agreed to repair it but I had to wait 5 days for a label from UPS. It's been almost 3 weeks and I've heard nothing. They also didn't offer to send a loaner phone. At least mine was under warranty, I see on the forum that Google and Huawei have refused to help and neither want to accept responsibility. Ron Nguyen My 6p shutdown prematurely everyday but at different battery percentages. Mostly around 30%, but I have had 40, 50s and 60. Anunnaki A battery replacement fixes the early shutdown problem. Sriidhar sriidhar My 6p died couple of weeks ago and Google and Huawei must be sued for not taking the responsibility, I'm a student and I saved a lot of money to buy the phone but now they're like, it's not our concern as you're out of warranty! Konstigt2 Very good, they should have issued a recall and fixed them all. To not have your phone avail when you need it in case of emergency could be fatal. I have gotten my battery and screen replaced and that fixed it for me. arpit saxena My 6p shutdown few months back, after bootloop and hasn't been turned on since them. Both companies failed to address the situation and to fix the fault Huawei asks for 400$. I don't seem to find any kind of Justice in this area. David Berry All you poor nexus folks hot rolled. High price.shite processor thats had issues in every phone its been put in & sealed in battery copping quick charge for 12months through then the new usbc port then add that to the Chinese manufacturer &issues that causes with returns & you have a massive recipie for disaster. So is your nexus 6p still beter than an s7e or note5or7?Maybe the little fire issue puts it on a par with note 7 just but with that 810 inside it was always doomed from the start. No wonder they canned it for the now overpriced pixel. I think id rather a umi z plus for under half the price. So wheres the samsung haters now? I hate them too but they do make the best phones once you tweak this & that & set it up right. My note5 died after 18 months too. It did cop a real hammering as a wifi hotspot for a while there though. It used to get real hot with a few people connected at once & my bro never let it rest & would run it hot & flat every day. Sometimes 2x a day so it was to be expected. I got 2 note 7s for Sweet f%$ck all & a free s7e from samsung so ill forgive them a little & send back my note5 in the fire proof box & keep the other note 7 as a spare & as compensation for losing all my music &stuff on the note5& the fiasco of the n7recall. Sealed in batteries suck unless you replace your phone every 18months. Boy Ling Mine shuts down at 33% maybe 8 Times out of 10. I never updated to android 7. Mandeep Singh Pannu Mine normally dies off at 30%, then I connected it to charge, it comes back on at 30%.... Also I live up north in the UK, and at early in the morning, if I go out, and it's too cold it just dies randomly theadamsegal Very disappointed with Google. My Nexus 6P started shutting off at around 20% less than a year after I purchased it. The basically pulled an Apple with the release of the Pixel. After purchasing 3 Nexus phones in 4 years, I won't be buying a Google handset again. Ashwini Kumar Same issue here. Phone dies suddenly at 10-15% without any warnings. I love the phone but battery is pathetic. I barely get 10 hours on light usage. I hate apple but the 6s plus from work would be at 50% battery at the end of the day. First google deserted the nexus brand and then not honouring the issue. Disappointed! Sean Stone I'm currently replying from my just received RMA replacement for the boot loop issue. My warranty was technically up in November but the Google Tech Support hooked me up anyway. Better outcome than I was expecting. Thomas Boel Mine shut's down at round about 20%, but only when the screen is turned on! The warning comes and immediately it starts shutting down. Maggie Smith I don't get any warning. It just reboots at random. I wish I did get a warning. David Schleifstein Shuts down at 15% for me, closer to 30% for my wife's. I also noticed that a short time in colder temperatures can cause the battery to drop dead at 50% and up. Ger PG How is this affecting users? David McFee Same issue. Daily premature shutdown. So annoying. Jon Watts Get a grip people. It's just a phone. If it doesn't work just get a new one. I've had the 6P since its release in 2015. Yes I've had a few issues but nothing that didn't eventually get fixed. Dirge Yeah, all those thousands of people that suffer from this problem better just get a grip. So Google sold a defective product, so what? Go buy another one. Duh. "I'm not having any problems therefore these people need to get their shit together." *Rolls eye's* Drew Harden https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/fff14c9ec4b9b4966ae37554f13b373d9bfa270aa644c3e5ef01a5fca3723410.png Mine usually shuts down when the phone is pretty cold and then I turn the screen on and then it just dies. In the warmer weather it still dies with 15% every time though. If I start a Snapchat video below 20% it's instantly off. Dan Molina I haven't had a shut down at 60% but I get it at 25% pretty consistently. Bootloop is rare too; however, I do get random restarts usually while on a phone call. Danny Mestriner Good, maybe they will finally get off their lazy asses and treat us like actual customers. I also have the shutdown issue since Nougat. Philip Quach I've had the same issue even after factory reset. It's especially bad when the temperature outside is cold. I'm really disappointed with Huawei and Google about this. Artūras Rimonis Having the same issue. It always shuts down at 15% or even more. Cara Buttitta sometimes mine dies at 20% sometimes at 60%. just today my 6p was at 90%, I took one picture without the flash and it shut down. very frustrating David Perez Yes, it's been an issue since nougat, from what I recall. Both Nexus 6p devices I have suffered from increased battery drain, and sudden shutdown anywhere from 15 to 25%. Google points to Huawei, Huawei points to Google. I downgraded one device back to marshmallow. Battery drain is still pronounced, but at least no shutdown. I get my warning at 15% and can run until the single digits. John Adams Will die between 20-35% every time, also randomly restarts at around 50%. This phone has been plagued with bugs since release... Jordan Hindley https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/0aef98131463828edbc4ecec53b90938738636b0a4ab26649126e2b51247d48d.png My device shuts down at lots of different battery percentages and won't reboot until i attach to a power source. It's a nightmare. MeanBeans I get that all the time as well even after I changed the battery Mike I Easy. Have Google make their own phones. Call them, oh, Pixel? I'm writing this on my lg5x with 7.1.2. Very happy with it, but will take 200 off coupon on the LG g6 against any and all future 5x claims. Seiga Is it safe to say I should utilize my Nexus protect? I too am suffering from this issue. CJ Nexus 6p start shutting down with 1 to 2 times a day, which increase to more than 10 times within 3 month..huwaei and Google blaming each other for issues..phone is under warranty, but can't do anything.. Miresnare Love my 6p. Never had an issue with it apart from the slo-mo on the camera. Wonderful device. Rob Paek My 6P shut off abruptly right after it gave me the 15% warning the other day. Other than that it has been freezing lately and forcing me to reboot. lance colton Suing is great and all, but every AMERICAN class action lawsuit does absolutely nothing for those of us that aren't in the USA. All the times Nvidia and Sony got sued for stuff they sold me that didn't work as advertised, I'm entitled to NOTHING. This phone is such garbage. Just got it back from the bootloop repair, and the battery starts dying at 20% left. Then 40%. Yesterday, 60%. WTF. I don't think it's Google's fault, though. They would have fixed the software if they can by now. More like Huawei built this thing out of garbage, so it actually needs to be replaced after a year. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/776a4957bbcf9a86578fe290eba3107f160fabf3d0d520adb81993f61d67cca0.png You wouldn't believe the trouble I had getting this thing in for repairs either. I bought it from my carrier so I can't deal with Google or Huawei. They do troubleshooting but for warranty I have to deal with 'Freedom mobile'. I have to go into a certain shopping mall and go to a specific kiosk that is a designated repair center. They refused to honor the terms of the warranty, specifically that the original bootloop repair gives me 90 days more warranty. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/735c6d189c2684ae884f4c97c0d443766058dfa8c7119577c26c17b6da30b031.png Even the Huawei website says it's under warranty for a few more days. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/63182bf80270d912f90486d64178eff22d06e6ef98c0bbc1b1c6fcad3b6f4c62.png I had to give up at the kiosk, go to my car, and phone 611. Talked to an idiot that wastes my time with irrelevant troubleshooting, then she tries to tell me the warranty is expired too. Ask for a supervisor. Same story, but she speaks better English. I argue with her that they need to honor the terms on their website, but she says I'm not understanding them. I refuse to give up, she finally places me on hold for 5 min, comes back, admits I'm correct. I still have 3 days warranty according to her now. She puts a note on the account, then I go back to the kiosk, tell the guy there to read the note and finally he calls his manager, and figures out how to process the claim. If they didn't glue the stupid thing together, I'd replace the battery myself. They choose to make it un-repairable, they can fix it. Jeremy Miethker that means its going to bootloop soon. that is what happened to me Cindy Up until the April 2017 update, I was experiencing this same issue. My Nexus 6P would die with as much as 23% battery life left. oscar acevedo Oh that explains why my phone unexpectedly shuts down from time to time. Nexus 6P v7.1.2 blenderboy People still buy google devices like Pixel. Consumers vote with their money. The moment you buy a device you are promoting the brand. I don't think there will be any outcome for this lawsuit. This is just a publicity stunt. Samsung hardware is great, software is shit. Google software is ok but hardware partners do not work properly with Google(initial supply, firmware updates, warranty replacements). I am waiting for Pixel(maybe in 2 yrs) after seeing how current Pixel owners are treated by Google. Apple hardware is great, software works as expected. I use Linux at home and without itunes it is difficult to use a iPhone. So only option for me is Android. Charles Jordan I have the Nexus 6P a lotnd I have no issues and it's all updated. ThEGr33k Sent mi e of for RMA in the UK they did a "software update" to android 7 and sent it back. Safe to say the early shutdown and terrible battery life is still here... Have sent an email asking for the battery to be replaced so see what i hear back... Felipe I had my 6P fallen into the bootloop problem, I was given a replacement as Huawei honored its 15 months warranty (even though the documentation everywhere says it has 12 months factory warranty, it in fact has 15 months, with Huawei, but NOT with Google, shame Google!). Now, I'm about to get this replacement unit and pray, really pray hard that nothing new appears with this phone. Even tough there are now reports of replaced phones crashing again into the bootloop bug and, recently that Android 7.1.2 final, screwed the fingerprint sensor. Many are not liking the way Google+Huawei (yes, both) is handling this crisis, which in fact is a major one. I think customers who spent lots of hard earned money should get a quality device which keeps on working well, even after its warranty period expired and, wheren there is a well known massive problem, the manufacturer(s) Hardware+Software should honor fixes or reimburses, despite the fact that there are now the Pixels phones. If my replacement phone fails, I'd be more than willing to participate in a class action suit. Jeremy Miethker my brothers replacement phone already went into bootloop 5 days after receiving it. my phone died last week. Jacob Kraniak I thought I was going crazy when I noticed my 6P constantly rebooting on it's own. At least now I know I'm not alone with htis issue. Hopefully they give us something back in return. Maybe a replacement? Hell, I'd rather just return it at this point and use whatever credit they give me towards a Pixel or OP3T. that's not to say I haven't loved the 6P of course. Alexander Dumo Ive had this issue since updating my 6P sometime this past December. We shouldn't have to live with charging our phone before it hits approx 15%-20% battery life. When that warning pops up, the phone just shuts down. Make no sense...please fix this Huawei/Google! Charles Constantine I reported shutdowns at battery levels of 20-60 percentage remaining and was given a list of things to do including a "factory reset" and then told to report back by Google Project fi support. ARDankar I am glad I did not upgrade to nougat yet. Keep me posted on any news regarding issues with the Nexus 6P. David Droddy The Goog replaced my 6P very quickly when I demonstrated the sudden shut down problem even in safe mode and after full factory reset. Why would you report that Google is not responsive to this issue? Seanmiz Yep, I've experienced both issues on my 6P. I got hit with the bootloop of death a few months ago, luckily still under warranty with Huawei and got a replacement. I get the early battery shutdown usually in the 10-20% range. prwnd https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/cd48abb593ae6c1dd226cbe06ba45cf7195abd40318303b2290ca9229846939e.png Biojoe Me too. Travis Coble Oddly enough, sometimes it shuts down early, and sometimes it's fine. However, given my use of it and constant recharging, I'm convinced that this will end up going nowhere because the problem is actually pretty normal for devices that are going on two years of age due to the use of LIon batteries. People claiming shutdown at 60%? I'd need to see it to believe it... maverick7526 https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/3b98bc27cfb84fed5d59d503e403949c6d1cd50a18f37dd23dc58235aba80ad6.png It happens. It happened to me in Feb. It was very cold out and the phone just shut off, and would not turn on again until it was plugged into a charger. Brett Crowley Mine just hit a random boot loop and recovery mode is not working. Jeremy Miethker once it bootloops there is nothing you can do. it is now a cool paper weight Hussain Ahmadi I really hope they sue google for this. 6P keeps restarting without any reason, not to forget the excessive freezing issues. Google is getting very arrogant and need some spanking Hussain Ahmadi And of course this will be the last phone I've ever buy from google. Waiting eagerly for Note 8 mercado79 Yes, both issues. The battery issue was covered under warranty directly by Google. The bootloop issue occurred 1 month out of warranty and both companies told me there​ was nothing they could do for me. Marcin Nowak I had this issue since beginning of the year and Google forums just said wait for update. Finally contacted Google about it just last week feed up asking for help and they told me to F.off pretty much. zefred Got it. It started RIGHT after the one year mark. Contacted google AND Huawei, and was turned down by both. My N6p doesn't even last half a day with recharging. I need to carry extra external batteries everywhere with me, as well as a charge and cable, and the device is barely a year and a half old. NOT a happy camper :( 12321 Law360, Dallas (April 17, 2017, 5:29 PM EDT) -- Google Inc. and Huawei Technologies USA Inc. were hit with a putative class action in Texas federal court Friday over an allegedly defective smartphone, the Nexus 6P, which the user claims suffers from premature battery drainage. Plaintiff Alex Gorbatchev wants to represent a class of consumers who bought the Google Nexus 6P phones, which he says also suffer from a problem that sends the phone into a “death spiral” in which the phones suddenly switch off and then restart in what is referred to as an... https://www.law360.com/texas/articles/913933/class-hits-google-with-suit-over-defective-nexus-phones https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Bad-Cellphones.pdf Claude L Now it's getting worst with android 7.1.2. I was also experiencing early shutdown with my 6p when using 7.1.1. But now I'm unable to use my phone on a daily basis without having a early shutdown. Today again battery was at 20% and last week it happened at 37%. I was so happy when I bought my phone a year and a half ago because I was able to use it for the whole day without having to charge the battery... Now I have to carry a charger with me... It sucks theadb Anything we can do in Canada? Mine just shuts off randomly all the time. This is was a RMA from an older 6P that had massive battery issues. The guy I just spoke to said my original warranty was up in January this year and there was nothing he could do. This phone shuts down randomly all the time now. I've missed by alarm to wake up twice now because it just shuts off. Only way to power it back on is to go into bootloader and restart. adi sararu mine had his 20% dying today first time... and after reading above... my time to never touch google phones again :D Steve I had same battery problem with my 6p, rather than taking out a lawsuit against Google I just purchased a new battery and replaced it. Phone no longer has the issue, lawsuit closed Kyle Snider Phone shuts off early on me allllllll the time, does this lawsuit affect us in Canada? Adam Macias I'm suffering the premature battery death. I have yet to cross the boot loop issue though. God help me if I do. Jeremy Miethker well im a not so proud owner of a $800 dollar paper weight. i cant believe how this is being handled they want me to spend $550 to replace it than they will reimburse me. are you kidding me. however was wondering if this would happen again if i did get a new one? Jacob Lunsford My 6P shuts down with anywhere from 10-30% battery remaining. pi app my problem is the uber driver app stopped working on this phone about 2 weeks ago (same app was working fine on this phone for last 8 months). when i log into uber driver app on any other fine it works fine. a chinese person told me because huawei is a chinese company and they hate uber they may have done something to prevent the app from working on their phones. i was going to buy another nexus 6p to see if same problem occurs. then i will know. my battery's been fine with my phone. Svart Adam Solander My phone shutdown at around 20-25%. Quite annoying. sleepytinksy Also have this issue - phone shut down right before the gates opened for a soccer match and they only issued digital tickets, scan-able on the phone. As you can imagine, that was less than ideal. Panda without dark circle My 6p shut down at 35% or below when I travel to Japan on winter, I thought it was because of the cold. But when I back to Malaysia, it shut down at 60% or below, not every time but this scared me. :( And yes, it doesn't warning me at all, shut down without any sign. Ahmad Zaib I am from India and facing the same issue on my Nexus 6P. The Huawei customer care response has been that they are coming up with an official response soon. This has been the status since more than 3 weeks now. Anyone here, who knows what can we expect here or how do we proceed? Tom Z 71% (seventy-one percent) Shutdown! Mine just hit a new low (or high) with this issue. I just had mine shut down at 71% (seventy-one percent) remaining battery life. This is a very big problem. I was taking pictures when the phone just went into shut down. I couldn't get it to stay running until I connected power. This needs to be fixed! I'm on the latest version with April 2017 security updates. Tom boses Same issue here. I'm reaching the shutdown at about about 38% mark! I'm frustrated at Google's inaction! Jay Miller Mine has died anywhere from 43% to 15%. It is random battery percentage for the shutdown, but it always claims it is at 15% then shuts down. The minute you plug it in and turn it on, the battery percentage is what it really shut off at, and it is usually in the high 20's. So yesterday I tried something. I went to the factory images I had for my Nexus, and through ADB, I sent it "back in time" to Android 6.0 (original release firmware). I then put it to the test. I turned on the hotspot and started playing games that I know drain the battery. I got the warning at 15%....no shutdown. I continued further. I got a warning at 14%, at 12%, 10%, 5% and eventually it shutdown at 1%. I placed it on the charger and fired it up and it was "truly" at 1% battery. I haven't seen it fully drain in months. While the claim that new batteries work, it also appears that Google has work to do on their end as well. Reversing the firmware did work for me. However, the device wanted to update immediately. I accepted the security patch, but at this point in time I will refuse to upgrade back to Nougat if I can gain the full use of my phone without it shutting off prematurely. Here is my log: Firmware I was on 05/03/2017 at 11 AM Eastern US time: N2G47H (April 2017 Security Patch) Firmware I reversed it to on 05/03/2017 at 12 PM Eastern US time: MDA89D (September 2015) Firmware after accepting most recent security patch OTA on 05/03/2017 at 6:45 PM Eastern US time: MTC19T (Android 6.0.1 but security is May 2016) Mister Sonny I'm having the early shutdown issue, for me it's consistently at around 25% battery life. This is made worse by the fact that I have an accessory almost always connected (Fitbit Blaze) NumbGrip I've been having this problem since about 6 weeks ago and it started completly out of nowhere Vince Romeo I've encountered the boot loop problem on 6p after <18 mo. Occasionally sudden shutdowns before that happened. My wife's phone is ~19+ and has sudden shutdown issues. Darshan Jain I am facing the same bootloop issue and my phones warranty has expired and Huawei and Google refused to help Shailla Chand My phone will be fresh off the charger at 100% and shut down within 15 minutes. Talk about frustrating.. Gerbil My 6p has been losing power at alarming rate always with Android system and Android OS at the top. Then it began randomly shutting down an demanding to be charged after sending a notification my battery hit 0% when I was well above 40% and failed to detect my SIM card for about 3 hours. I down own a power bank so I'm really suffering here as my phone dies midday and I can't use it for the latter half of the day. chesterbr Now that you mention... I (a no-bootloop-but-frequent-shutdown-at-30% Nexus 6P user) had a couple failures on SIM card detection. Not sure how long they lasted, removing and reinserting seemed to have done the trick... keeps one wondering... :-/ rpeltz My Nexus 6p shuts down when the battery drops below 49 percent. This can happen in as little as an hour of idle time and the phone is just over 1 year old. ←  Older Comments  → Follow Android Police 1.49M 468k 143k 115k Latest Deals 8 [Deal Alert] Get 20% off electronics on eBay with promo code 2017/05/16 4:18pm PDTMay 16, 2017 1 [Deal Alert] 23k gold-plated LG Watch Urbane Luxe is just $150 at B&H ($150+ off) 2017/05/15 9:01pm PDTMay 15, 2017 12 [Deal Alert] Monday is here with 19 temporarily free and 6 on-sale apps 2017/05/15 1:28pm PDTMay 15, 2017 12 [Deal Alert] Unlocked Samsung Galaxy S8 on sale for $689.99 via eBay 2017/05/15 9:39am PDTMay 15, 2017 29 [Deal Alert] Get an Exynos-powered dual SIM Galaxy S8+ for $804.99 (no tax except in CA/FL) 2017/05/14 7:07pm PDTMay 14, 2017 Latest Poll Do you use a screen protector on your phone?

MGM chairman and CEO Gary Barber announced the appointment Tuesday as part of its first-quarter earnings call. “I want to thank our Board of Directors for their continued support and also welcome David Krane, who recently joined the Board,” Barber said. “David is a 17-year veteran of Google, and is currently the CEO and managing partner of Google Ventures. He is a valuable addition to MGM’s Board and I’m looking forward to working with him.” GV is the former Google Ventures and operates independently from Google. Krane oversees GV’s global activities and invests in a wide range of technology companies including Uber, Nest, Blue Bottle Coffee, and Urban Engines. Krane’s Google career began more than 17 years ago, as director of global communications and public affairs in which he oversaw the company’s strategic communications programs worldwide, and worked as a member of the senior leadership team to grow Google. He previously worked for Apple Computer, Qualcomm, Four11 (now Yahoo! Mail), and two computer security software developers. The privately held MGM also reported Tuesday a decline in first-quarter earnings to $35.2 million from $61 million in the year-ago quarter. Revenues also declined to $264 million from $311.3 million.

Name: Subject: Message: Google releases Android Things Developer Preview 4 for IoT devices Newsby John Callaham9 hours ago 115 6 Google decided not to wait for tomorrow’s start of its Google I/O conference to launch the latest developer version of its Android Things operating system. The company has released the fourth such preview version of the OS, which is designed to be used by Internet of Things (IoT) devices. See also: What is the problem with IoT security? – Gary explains November 19, 2016 Google says this new version will allow its supported IoT boards to access its Google Assistant SDK tools, which means that development boards like the Intel Edison, the NXP Pico i.MX6UL and the Raspberry Pi 3 can use the company’s voice-command digital assistant. The fourth preview build also adds support for another developer board, the NXP i.MX7D. In addition, the company has released both the code and the hardware design files for the Intel Edison Candle.  This will be the first of a series of such releases by Google, which are supposed to show third-party OEMs how Android Things on the software side can work together with the appropriate hardware. Google says that the design files can be used by hardware makers to quickly fabricate the module. Google will be showing off demos of Android Things software and hardware projects this coming week at Google I/O. In the meantime, if you are skilled in IoT projects, you can go ahead and download Developer Preview 4 images from the Android Things site. You might also want to join Google’s IoT Developers Community on Google+ to chat and learn from others who are working on Android Things.projects. There’s no word yet on when Google plans to launch a non-preview version of the OS.

That’s the upshot of a federal appeals court’s decision Tuesday rejecting the argument that Google has become so popular as a verb that it should lose its status as a protected trademark. Genericide, as it’s known, is the curse of companies whose brands gain such strong currency in the marketplace that they morph into product categories. Think of aspirin, escalator or yo-yo, but not Coke. The fight over whether one of the world’s most valuable brands should be declared generic started when a man named Chris Gillespie in 2012 acquired 763 internet domain names that included the word “google.” After Google filed an objection with the board that referees domain-name disputes and accused Gillespie of “cybersquatting,” he and another man asked an Arizona federal court to cancel Google’s trademark on the grounds that it’s a “generic term universally used to describe the act of internet searching,” according to court filings. The Arizona judge didn’t buy the argument, and on Tuesday, neither did the U.S. Court of Appeals in San Francisco. The men didn’t present sufficient evidence that the public thinks of the word ‘google’ primarily as a generic name for internet search engines rather than as the brand of the Google search engine in particular, the three-judge panel said. “The mere fact that the public sometimes uses a trademark as the name for a unique product does not immediately render the mark generic,” U.S. Circuit Judge Richard Tallman wrote for the panel. Tallman noted that other household names, including Coca-Cola Co., have beaten back efforts to have their brands declared generic and unprotected over the years. Coca-Cola won a 1982 trademark-infringement case against a local restaurant that surreptitiously replaced customer orders for “a coke” with a non-Coca-Cola beverage. The restaurant unsuccessfully argued that “coke” covered a generic category of soft drinks. Jason Kravitz, a Boston-based trademark lawyer, said the appeals court’s decision reinforces how difficult it is for challengers to have brand names declared generic. “These kinds of challenges are par for the course when a company has been successful enough to establish market dominance,” he said.

Now Google is placing its mobile operating system right inside cars, a bid to cement its core service in the auto industry as more technology sweeps in. On Monday, ahead of its I/O mobile developers conference, Alphabet Inc.’s Google showed off its next step in automotive software: an Android version of touchscreen car consoles and infotainment systems. It will host popular applications, like Google Maps and Spotify, but also control car features like seat positioning and temperature. The new system also embeds the Google Assistant — the company’s voice control service, for searching on the go, asking for directions, and making phone calls — in cars for the first time. Google showed off live demonstrations of the operating system running on the Audi Q8 and Volvo V90 SUVs. Patrick Brady, a vice president of engineering for Android, said the system will make its way to Audi and Volvo’s entire fleets, along with other manufacturers. Google showed a concept of the software running on a Chrysler vehicle earlier this year. This isn’t Google’s first stab at software for cars. In 2014, the tech giant introduced Android Auto, a system that lets people project content from their Android smartphones to their car’s screen. Brady said Android Auto now runs on 300 car models. The new system plunges deeper, taking over the underlying software on the car. A driver doesn’t need to plug in an Android phone to run it. It also adds some features, like 3-D mapping and satellite images, that Android Auto lacks. Bradysaid this fusion of apps and controls inside a car is necessary. “Where cars are going, everything is integrated into one display,” he said. “We think the future is a much more seamless, integrated system.” Other software companies have pitched a similar system. BlackBerry Ltd.’s QNX division powers the systems inside of more than 50 million cars currently on the road, including models from Ford Motor Co. and Daimler AG’s Mercedes-Benz. Samsung Electronic Co. spent $8 billion for Harman International Inc., a leading supplier of in-car entertainment services. And some car companies, like Toyota Motor Corp., have invested in their own features, highlighting manufacturer’s concerns with ceding a critical consumer experience to tech companies. Apple Inc., which currently offers the CarPlay product that’s similar in practice to Android Auto, is also working on its own car operating system to power its self-driving software, Bloomberg News has reported. Brady said that Apple’s CarPlay could run on top of cars with the embedded Android system. Bloomberg News received a preview of an Android-based infotainment system running on a Volvo. This version of the software had three main windows for users: a central panel for playing music, making calls and navigating; another with a grid of core car functions; and a third that lists installed Android apps. A button on the steering wheel and a voice command can activate the Google Assistant. Google executives said the software will not reach to instruments critical to car safety — it’s keeping YouTube off the screen, for instance, given the risk to distracting drivers. The new car feature also hints at Google’s long-term ambitions to spread its artificial intelligence service to every corner of consumer’s lives. For example, a user in a compatible car could ask the Assistant to turn on the lights at home before arriving, Brady said.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 16 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman CloudMigrator Online launches to enable self-service cloud migrations New online tool automates migrations to Google’s G Suite for SMBs /EIN News/ — LONDON, May 16, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — CloudMigrator is changing the cloud landscape for small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) with the launch of a new self-service cloud migration tool, CloudMigrator Online. The solution enables organizations to carry out their own G Suite migrations through a simple five step process, removing the need for external assistance. CloudMigrator Online requires less technical knowledge than the current iteration of the software and is being targeted at direct customers to enable them to handle their own migrations in house. The previous version of CloudMigrator is highly regarded by Google and has migrated over 6 million users from over 87 countries to the cloud with a 99.8% success rate. As the tool required users to download a piece of software and then go through several technical steps to carry out their migration, CloudMigrator is launching the simpler service to drive more business from sub-100 user organizations that want a solution to migrate to Google without the need for specialist help. CloudMigrator is encouraging businesses to test drive CloudMigrator Online with a free trial where they can migrate two user mailboxes to Google with unrestricted functionality. James Doggart, CEO at CloudMigrator, said: “Our new CloudMigrator Online solution will be an important part of our offering to a market that is looking to gain the many advantages that cloud computing offers. After helping over 6 million users migrate to the cloud we recognized the opportunity to help small and medium-sized businesses that haven’t historically had the time, resources or knowledge to migrate themselves. One of the major USPs of CloudMigrator Online is that the process is simplified in a way that requires less technical knowledge. This should appeal to direct customers more, enabling them to handle their own migrations in house. “The latest research from the Cloud Industry Forum suggests that cloud migrations are, for many, a struggle; just 18 per cent of the organizations they spoke to stated that they were completely satisfied with their chosen migration methods,” James continued. “We’ve developed CloudMigrator Online to take the pain out of moving to the cloud and make it easier for organizations of all sizes to take advantage of the transformational benefits of the delivery model. “For us at CloudMigrator, we see the move to cloud as a ‘people transformation process’. It’s not about the technology per se, but how it enables people to change the way that they work, where they work and how they interact. Being able to access IT as-a-service opens the door to increased collaboration and more innovation, and is critical to the future success of UK plc.,” James concluded. Based in Manchester in the UK, CloudMigrator developer Cloud Technology Solutions has enjoyed significant success since it was founded in 2008 and it stands as one of the fastest-growing Google Cloud Premier Partners in the world. Having completed two of the largest G Suite deals in EMEA, it was listed in the Sunday Times Tech Track 100 in 2016 as well as the Deloitte Tech 50 for fastest growing privately owned tech companies with over 400% growth. NOTES TO EDITORS About Cloud Technology Solutions Cloud Technology Solutions is a Google Cloud Premier Partner and leading reseller of G Suite Business solutions that provides planning, migration, technical deployment and responding to the ongoing support needs to millions of users worldwide.

 How Google's band of hardware pirates has re-invented itself after its legendary leader jumped ship Steve Kovach May 16, 2017, 4:08 PM 2,961 facebook linkedin twitter email print Regina Dugan (left) and Google's Rick OsterlohSamantha Lee/Business Insider; Facebook; Ramin Talaie/Getty Images Almost three years ago, one of Google's most celebrated executives took the stage at the company's big developer conference and declared that the future was being built in a secretive hardware group she led. "You're going to get a glimpse of a small band of pirates trying to do epic shit," she said, referencing nearly a dozen ambitious technology products under development and touting the team's quick pace of execution. Today Regina Dugan, the Google executive, is gone, and the remaining members of the crew she had assembled have made limited progress turning the bold vision into reality. Google's Advanced Technologies and Products group, or ATAP, still works in its own secure building on the outskirts of the Google campus, but the mission, culture, and spirit are much different than they once were, current and former members of the group told Business Insider. "We're not being pirates anymore," said one person involved with ATAP. "We're lowering the flag." Instead of dreaming up far-fetched research and development projects, the ATAP group now functions more like a product division tasked with shipping market-ready goods. The team of engineers and software developers now works more closely with sales and marketing employees in Google's consumer hardware division. And the autonomy to pick projects and obtain budget — once taken for granted by the group during Dugan's reign — is now a rigid process based as much on proving business potential as on doing something "epic." Dan Kaufman, a former deputy of Dugan's who now oversees the group's day-to-day operations, has brought a more subdued leadership style to ATAP, taking pains to stay out of the spotlight, sources said. The changing nature of ATAP reflects Google's ongoing efforts to adapt to a competitive, fast-moving tech market while delivering the balance of innovation and financial discipline expected by investors. With many of Google's other moonshot projects now spun out into separate companies that are tucked under the overarching Alphabet corporation umbrella, Google is focused on efforts that directly tie into its core businesses more than ever. Rick Osterloh, Google's hardware boss, now has ATAP reporting into himGoogle For ATAP, that's meant getting folded into Google's broader hardware group, which makes everything from smartphones to streaming video TV dongles, and which is overseen by Rick Osterloh, a former Motorola executive. While the pirates once reported directly to Google CEO Sundar Pichai, the ATAP group now answers to Osterloh. Indeed, many of the changes at ATAP are due to Osterloh's stewardship. A lot of it also comes from Ruth Porat, the CFO of Google's parent company Alphabet, who has spent the last two years instilling a new financial accountability across the company, sources said. Google declined to comment on this story or make Kaufman or Osterloh available for an interview. Smartphone without a screen Several of the people Business Insider spoke to said the morale within the ATAP ranks remains healthy. The group's mission may have changed, causing some to follow Dugan to her new job at Facebook, but those who remain view the change as part of the broader evolution that has shaped the company in recent years. And work continues quietly on a variety of exciting projects, even if getting the greenlight to start a project is no longer as easy as in the past. Among the stealth projects underway is a handheld device based on the concept of "affective computing," a discipline focused on creating gadgets that can interpret and respond to human emotions. One source referred to the project as similar to a smartphone, but without a screen. Another seemed less enthusiastic about the project, likening it to something you'd see on Kickstarter. An MIT Media Lab project based on similar affective computing concepts, but not affiliated with the ATAP effort, describes a "touch phone" that includes a "touch-sensitive surface which conveys the user's physical response over a computer network. The recipient sees a small colored icon on his computer screen which changes in real time according to the way his conversational partner is interacting with the phone object." Screenshot from a Google ATAP video in the buccaneering daysGoogle And in the fall ATAP plans to launch Jacquard, a "smart" jacket that lets you control your smartphone by swiping on the fabric. The $350 jacket, which was designed in collaboration with Levi's and which will be the ATAP division's first real standalone project, was originally supposed to launch this spring. People working on the project are optimistic that it'll launch in time for the new fall target and said that Osterloh appears to be personally excited about it. More secrecy When Google holds its 3-day annual developers' conference in Mountain View, Calif this week, the ATAP group will not have its own session, according to the official schedule, unlike during the previous two years. The stark difference in personalities at the top has changed the face of ATAP. Many saw Dugan, who left to create a similar group at arch-rival Facebook, as the heart of ATAP's culture. And with her gone, there has been a notable change in style. Dugan relished in publicly unveiling jaw-dropping new projects, as she did during a keynote for Facebook a few weeks ago when she showcased projects to let people type with their brains or "hear" with their skin. "Darpa Dan" KaufmanREUTERS/Larry Downing Osterloh, by contrast, has taken the opposite approach, eschewing flashy public demonstrations of prototypes. The new ATAP leadership has decided to keep projects under wraps until they're almost fully baked, if they reveal them at all. "Rick has set himself up as the guy who releases information," one person familiar with the matter said. "When Rick came in, he changed the whole schedule." The person said that there was at least one new ATAP project scheduled to go public last year, but with Dugan gone and Kaufman and Osterloh in charge, everything was put back in stealth. According to another person close to Osterloh, the executive didn't want the public getting distracted by something new and exciting from ATAP that may never launch. His vision was to keep the world focused on the mainstream products coming out the consumer hardware division. Kaufman, who also worked with Dugan at DARPA and ATAP and is affectionately known as "DARPA Dan," is another key to the quieter role ATAP has had over the last year. "He's much mellower than Regina," one source said of Kaufman. "He's the kind of guy who isn't seeking the spotlight." One person close to Kaufman said that he didn't seek the same kind of publicity and fanfare that Dugan would when she'd unveil new projects. Instead, he has tasked the division with putting their heads down on their work, while greenlighting or ramping up some new projects. "We definitely continue to work on things," another source said. "We're just not going to be announcing stuff way ahead anymore." Graduates and dead projects Today, ATAP projects have to fit into Google's broader hardware ambitions, which revolves around shipping mainstream consumer products like Pixel phones and the Google Home speaker. Last year, for example, Osterloh killed ATAP's most high-profile product, Project Ara, shortly before it was scheduled to launch. Google even had marketing plans and other promotional material ready to go. Ara was a modular phone that would let users swap in parts like new cameras, processors, and health sensors and keep the device up to date over time. Whereas most people probably keep their phones for one or two years, an Ara phone was designed to last five years and to improve over time.A Project Ara phone.Project Ara But Ara was a wildly expensive project that conflicted directly with Google's upcoming Pixel phone. Even as recently as a month before Ara's demise, employees were told the project was going well and on track to launch. It was dead by September of last year, about a month and a half before the Pixel's debut. Google has also said it could use what it learned with Ara and bring the technology to other devices. Even though Ara hardly looked like a mainstream product with its funky building block-like modules, it wasn't the only product on the roadmap. The Ara group was also working on a high-end phone with a premium design and all the other bells and whistles you'd expect from an iPhone or Samsung Galaxy phone. The first version of Ara may have seemed experimental, but the ambition was to make Ara a mainstream consumer product. And some ATAP employees said they felt like it was killed because that would conflict too much with the Pixel. Google has said it can still use Ara technology for other projects, but nothing has come of that yet. ATAP has had its share of successes over the years too. Project Tango, which allows phones and tablets to sense 3D space, is now being baked into Android. A Spotlight Stories animated short, Pearl, was nominated for an Oscar. Another project that made sensors that can detect congestive heart failure was acquired by Verily, Alphabet's life sciences company. There are other hints that ATAP continues to explore new projects. One job listing last year implied that ATAP was working on a social smartphone game following the success of "Pokémon GO." There's also that affective computing device. And work continues on Project Soli, which uses miniature radar to control gadgets based on hand movements. The ATAP garage doorGoogle In the meantime, current and former ATAP employees note the distinct change within the division since Dugan's departure and how it feels more and more like a mainstream product house than the product-focused R&D lab it was originally designed to be. The two-year limit on new projects isn't strictly enforced anymore, and there's a chance it could go away altogether. Some even speculated that ATAP's distinction could be eliminated and its staff and projects completely assimilated into Google's hardware division, ending any remaining autonomy from Google its employees have enjoyed. But in the near term, the impression within ATAP appears to be that projects will be allowed to continue as long as there's a good chance they'll result in real products or "graduate" to another division within Google. And some even said the moves were necessary to justify ATAP's existence and keep its ambition alive. Do you know anything about Google ATAP or Google's hardware division?

That's the upshot of a federal appeals court's decision Tuesday rejecting the argument that Google has become so popular as a verb that it should lose its status as a protected trademark. Genericide, as it's known, is the curse of companies whose brands gain such strong currency in the marketplace that they morph into product categories. Think of escalator or yo-yo, but not Coke. The fight over whether one of the world's most valuable brands should be declared generic started when a man named Chris Gillespie in 2012 acquired 763 Internet domain names that included the word "google." After Google filed an objection with the board that referees domain-name disputes and accused Gillespie of "cybersquatting," he and another man asked an Arizona federal court to cancel Google's trademark on the grounds that it's a "generic term universally used to describe the act of Internet searching," according to court filings. The Arizona judge didn't buy the argument, and on Tuesday, neither did the U.S. Court of Appeals in San Francisco. The men didn't present sufficient evidence that the public thinks of the word "google" primarily as a generic name for Internet search engines rather than as the brand of the Google search engine in particular, the three-judge panel said. "The mere fact that the public sometimes uses a trademark as the name for a unique product does not immediately render the mark generic," U.S. Circuit Judge Richard Tallman wrote for the panel. Tallman noted that other household names, including Coca-Cola Co., have beaten back efforts to have their brands declared generic and unprotected over the years. Coca-Cola won a 1982 trademark-infringement case against a local restaurant that surreptitiously replaced customer orders for "a coke" with a non-Coca-Cola beverage.

Developer Preview 4 of Android Things OS is now available Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/05/16 11:57am PDTMay 16, 2017 15 Plus 1 on G+ 40 Share on Facebook 53 Share on Twitter Total Shares108 Android Things Google News Google officially released Android Things OS last year as a developer preview. If you're not familiar with it, the OS is a lightweight version of Android that maintains support for popular Android developer tools and APIs, like Android Studio and Google Play Services. The developer preview has received a few updates since then, with the last one adding support for the Google Assistant SDK. Now the fourth major version of the Developer preview has been released by Google. The most important new feature is support for the NXP i.MX7D Pico development platform. Connecting to digital audio devices over Inter-IC sound (I2S) now works as well. The Google Assistant SDK first arrived in Developer Preview 3.1 for the Raspberry Pi Voice Kit, but with Preview 4, the SDK should now work on all development boards. Finally, developers can now register additional interfaces with PioDriverManager. Being a developer preview, there are still many known problems, including Google Play Services slowdowns and system power management being completely disabled. Still, if you want to give it a try, you can find more information at the source link below and download the images here.

I'm not sure I want Android on devices that are going to be in my home and relied upon daily and for years to come. Paul thanks for your honesty rivasdiaz I would say that Android Things will be more under Google's control. They seem to imply updates will come directly from Google for all devices. That would be a huge selling point for Android Things. The news about Google creating a standardized interface between vendor and Android OS is also a significant step towards less friction in upgrades. At least they are aware of the problem and are moving in the right direction. Capt4chris This OS seems to be taking quite a while to progress. Suicide_Note Well, then, get to work on it.

By Jeromy Lloyd 13 hours ago Google has topped Leger’s Corporate Reputation Survey rankings for the fifth consecutive year. The 20th annual online survey of more than 27,000 Canadians evaluates 234 brands operating across Canada, weighing positive consumer sentiment against negative sentiment to produce a “reputation score.” The survey was conducted from Dec. 21 2016 to Jan 29, 2017. Leger Corporate Reputation Top 10 (with 2016 ranking) 1. Google (1) 2. Shoppers Drug Mart (3) 3. Canadian Tire (4) 4. Tim Hortons (10) 5. Dollarama (6) 6. Staples (11) 7. Sony (12) 8. Kellogg’s (5) 9. Campbell (9) 10. Home Depot (14) With seven companies returning from the 2016 top 10, the leaders on Leger’s list have remained remarkably stable over the years. Christian Bourque, executive vice-president of Leger, says the strongest performers on the list benefit from high familiarity and intimacy. “They have a level of proximity where [consumers] can express themselves clearly about them… There’s always a Shoppers near you, for example. And they all deliver a stable, simple brand promise, like Dollarama,” which has been climbing the ranking steadily since the 2008 recession, popping into the top 10 for the first time last year. Avoiding negative headlines has also proven to be important. “In terms of brand equity, once people dislike you, it’s hard to get them to like you again,” Bourque says. The two notable absences from last year’s top 10 are Heinz, which had been number two, and Samsung, which had been seventh. In a press release, Leger points to Heinz’s plant closings and layoffs for its drop to the 23rd spot on the list, while Samsung’s well-publicized woes with overheating smartphones is the reason for its decline to 24th, Leger said. “What is very obvious today, more so than at any time since Leger began conducting its reputational research, is that companies must be able to withstand scrutiny that comes from journalists, customers, regulators and increasingly shareholders in a 24-hour, always-on, social media environment,” says Kim West, chief client officer at National Public Relations, which partners on the study. “It’s a world in which there are few places to find cover.” Consumer feedback in the survey showed two dominant factors driving reputation: product quality and transparency. Compared to factors such as financial success, CSR and innovation, 52% of all respondents listed quality as relevant, and 35% said honesty and transparency affected their estimation of a given company.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 16 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Global Orchestration Software Market in the Mega Data Center Report 2017 /EIN News/ — Dublin, May 16, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Research and Markets has announced the addition of Wintergreen Research, Inc’s new report „Sea Change Series: Orchestration Software in the Mega Data Center” to their offering. Mobile data traffic is set to increase by a factor of eight between 2015 and 2020. Growth is anticipated at 53 percent per year, faster than systems revenue or industry revenue. The theme of this study is that the pace of data expansion creates the need for more modern means of managing data. There are some companies that are doing a better job, better than others of adapting to IT infrastructure to the wild influx of data. The four superstar companies that are able to leverage IT to achieve growth, Microsoft, Google, Facebook, and the leader AWS all use Clos architecture. What is significant is that systems have to hit a certain scale before Clos networks work Clos networks are what work now for flexibility and supporting innovation in an affordable manner. There is no dipping your toe in to try the system to see if it will work, it will not and then the IT says, We tried that, we failed, but what the executive needs to understand is that scale matters. A little mega data center does not exist. Only scale works. Many companies are using digital technology to create market disruption. Amazon, Uber, Google, IBM, and Microsoft represent companies using effective strategic positioning that protects the security of the data. As entire industries shift to the digital world, once buoyant companies are threatened with disappearing. A digital transformation represents an approach that enables organizations to drive changes in their business models and ecosystems leveraging cloud computing, and not just hyperscale systems but leveraging mega data centers.

Personally, there are a few things I’m hoping to see, let me explain… The best gifts for Android users New features from Google Home – Reminders, Daily Briefing, Casting, etc The biggest thing I want Google to work on with Assistant is improving Google Home. The smart speaker does a lot of good things, but some of the features it still lacks are mind-boggling. First and foremost there are reminders. There are hints in the latest Google Home app that this functionality is coming, and I’m really hoping Google makes that official at I/O. Further, I’d like to see some basic functions added to the device, like a sleep timer for music and an audible tone for feedback when the device is heard, or at least an option to do so. Right now, all that shows when Google Home hears you is a ring of lights, but that doesn’t do me any good when I’m in bed or looking in any other direction. The last thing I’d love to see Google add to Home is a casting option for its “My Day” feature. This is one of the things on the Amazon Echo Show that caught my attention, and it would be excellent for Google to add something similar to Home, but instead of playing on a built-in screen, having the device cast that to a nearby Chromecast. More third-party Assistant hardware Another thing I’m really hoping Google will take advantage of at I/O is introducing new hardware partners. Google Assistant is a powerful tool, and I can really see manufacturers implementing it in some interesting ways. For example, a compact, Echo Dot-like smart speaker would be an excellent addition to the Assistant family. Adding Assistant to unique form factors or home appliances would also be great to see. Google Assistant on Android TV Google announced that Assistant would make its debut on Android TV at some point this year, and personally, I’m very excited to see this happen. Based on the few minutes I spent trying the feature out with Nvidia at CES, I can see the potential, especially with Nvidia’s always-listening controller and Spot accessories. Assistant on Android TV is also going to make it easier for anyone with an Android TV device to browse content, complete searches, and even control their home. I can easily see this replacing a Google Home for many, as it probably will for me, so I’m hoping that I/O will give us the launch of this feature, or at least a more concrete launch date for this functionality. Better wake word recognition with improved integration across multiple Assistant-enabled devices One of the cool things about Google Home is that it can take over from the Assistant on your phone or watch, so you don’t have to worry about duplicating an answer on multiple devices. However, there are a lot of scenarios where this becomes more of a curse than a blessing. Sometimes, I want to talk to the Assistant on my phone and not on Home, but I don’t get the option if Home hears me. This is something Google needs to refine, even if it’s as simple as detecting the phone or watch is the one that heard your voice the clearest. There just has to be a better way. I was hoping at launch that the “Hey Google” command would be the simple solution, but months later that command still only hears me about 2/3 of the time, if that. Wake word recognition is something else Google needs to improve, as, with any command, Home is just getting worse and worse with recognizing voices. Regardless of what I say, over the past couple months, I feel like I have to repeat the command to get Home to hear me, and friends with the device have been telling me the same. Home mesh Wi-Fi combo Lastly, I’d love to see Google reveal or at least confirm the Google Home/Google Wifi combo we heard about a few months ago. Combining these two devices would make for a fantastic product, especially at the right price point. Ideally, I’d love to see this device look a lot like the current iteration of Google Wifi, but with always-listening Assistant capabilities in every extension router. And that’s it. That’s what I’d personally love to see Google announce for Assistant this week at Google I/O. What’s on your wishlist? Let us know in the comments!

Video by Robert Hanashiro MANHATTAN BEACH, Calif. — A year ago, when it was first unveiled, Google Home looked poised to be a smarter, more intelligent digital assistant than Amazon’s Alexa. That’s how it was pitched in its sneak peek demo at the Google I/O 2016 developer conference. But when it was released to the public in November, it didn't turn out that way. Many of the features didn't work as promised, and critics were mixed. The $129 speaker had potential, USA TODAY's Edward Baig and others said, though it was clearly playing catch up to Amazon's Alexa and the Echo speaker. Others were blunter: The Verge's Walt Mossberg called it "remarkably dumb." Meanwhile, Amazon went on to run away with market share and new innovations. Google Home review: In catch-up to Echo, but with promise Since Home was first introduced, Amazon has added limited voice calling to Echo speakers, announced a model that includes a camera to help make fashion suggestions, and another new Echo, the Show, with a video screen for making video calls and watching video recipes, for instance. Google Home has a skills gap.  (Photo: Google) So on the eve of I/O 2017, which opens Wednesday, how’s Home faring? Better, but the gaps are still there. It's an excellent $129 speaker for listening to music (especially if you're a YouTube fan, since Google knows your music tastes) and using your voice to look up spellings, math, trivia and other Google-smart stuff. But it's still inexplicably missing life stuff like the ability to set a calendar appointment on Google Calendar (you can only check it), create reminders, or read your latest e-mail. Alexa can do the first two, using Google Calendar. Amazon's Echo devices are powered by its Alexa artificial intelligence.  (Photo: Amazon) Related: Google has discovered hardware is, well, hard Google Home wants to be your assistant, heating up the rivalry with Amazon Echo and soon, Apple What works Since Home's debut, the product has been updated with new features and "services," little mini-apps you can use within Home, like Alexa's “skills.” Two highly touted features include being able to start up a Hyundai Sonata and warm it up in the driveway from Home, and the ability to decipher six different voices from different accounts, which is something Alexa can’t currently do. For instance, mom, dad, son and daughter could all link their Google accounts (calendars, music likes) into one unit, and by saying, “OK Google,” awake the unit to be personalized for them. One problem for many with the Alexa "skills" is that there are so many of them, it's hard to find new ones and keep track of them. As with Amazon's Alexa, Google's Home smartphone app has a listing of the "services," within the app, which is great. However, some work, and some don't. The good: —Games:  math, history and trivia quizzes, blackjack, tic tac doe. —Exercise:  7-minute workout, 5 minute planks. —Food ordering: Dominos —Transportation: hear schedules for San Francisco’s BART and the Atlanta Rail. What doesn't We asked the eBay price service to find prices for a used Sonos Play 3 speaker or Canon 5D Mark III camera. It failed to come up with a response for either of them. (A quick search of ebay.com shows dozens of both are readily available.) But eBay on Home was able to tell me that a used iPhone 6S was worth over $200. When we tried the Guitar Tuner service, it complained of an “internal error,” that never seemed to go away. Finally, shopping is particularly weak, when compared to the e-tail superiority of Amazon. Google says it can pull items from Costco, Bed and Bath Beyond and a handful of other retailers, but you won’t get very far. Home tells us that it can’t order anything over $100. "We think this amount covers most users needs," says Google spokesperson Nicol Addison. Voice computing is perhaps the biggest trend in tech for 2017 (when we’re not being hacked) with Amazon paving the way. Over 70% of folks using smart speakers are on the Echo system, according to eMarketer. In June, Apple could join Amazon, Microsoft, Google and Samsung by bringing its Siri voice assistant to a speaker, which some analysts have speculated could be announced at the upcoming Worldwide Developer Conference. Apple owns a headphone/speaker company, Beats, so it wouldn't be a stretch to see a shiny, colorful speaker start appearing at Apple Stores that you could also talk to. So the pressure is on for Google Home to tackle some more of those everyday tasks promised us a year ago, plus pull out a few more wow services. Listen up, Google. Ok? Readers — Home or Alexa?

Oh, and nobody really won, because basically, all the big players did, depending on your perspective. Google has the largest number of people using Android, Apple generates the most income via iOS, and Windows still commands the workplace for Microsoft. But the stakes are getting much higher for the next looming battle in the tech world. This one will be based around digital assistants, such as Amazon’s Alexa, Apple’s Siri, Microsoft’s Cortana and Google’s Assistant, among others. While much of the initial focus is, rightfully, around the voice-based computing capabilities of these assistants, I believe we’re going to see these assistants expand into text-driven chatbots, AI-driven autonomous software helpers and, most importantly, de facto digital gateways that end up tieing together a wide range of smart and connected devices. From smart homes to smart cars, as well as smartphones, PCs and wearables that span both our personal and professional lives, these digital assistants will (ideally) provide the consistent glue that brings together computing, services and much more across many disparate OS platforms. In short, they should be able to make our lives better organized, and our devices and services much easier to use. That’s why these assistants are so strategically important, and why so many other companies—from Facebook to Samsung—are working on their own variations. Another fascinating aspect of these digital assistants is that they have the potential to completely devalue the underlying platforms on which they run. To put it succinctly, if I can use, say, Alexa across an iPhone, a Windows PC, my smart home components and a future connected car, where does the unique value of iOS or Windows 10 go? Out the door…. This overarching importance and distancing from different platforms is why I refer to these assistants as the pre-eminent example of a “meta-platform”: something that provides the potential for expansion, via both APIs for new software development, and the connectivity of a regular platform, but at a layer “above” a traditional OS. With that thought in mind, it’s interesting to look at recent data TECHnalysis Research collected as part of a nearly 1,000-person survey of US consumers on usage of digital assistants on smartphones, PCs and, the hottest new entrant, smart speakers such as Amazon’s Alexa and Google Home. As mentioned earlier, in their present incarnations, these digital assistants are primarily focused on voice-based computing and the kinds of applications that are best-suited for simple voice-driven queries. So, to get a better sense of how these assistants are used, respondents were asked in separate questions how often (or even if) they used digital assistants on smart speakers (such as Amazon Echo), smartphones and PCs. The results were combined into the chart below. What’s fascinating is that, even though the smart speaker category is relatively new (the Echo is less than 2 years old) and Siri, the first smartphone-based digital assistant, arrived in 2011, it’s clear that people with access to a smart speaker like Echo (around 14% of US households according to the survey results) are using digital assistants significantly more than those with smart phones. While it’s tempting to suggest that this may be due to the perceived accuracy of the different assistants, in a separate question about accuracy, the rankings for Alexa, Siri and Google’s Assistant were nearly identical, meaning there was no one clear favorite. Instead, these results suggest that a dedicated function device placed in a central location within a home simply invites more usage. Translation: if you want to be relevant in these early stages of the digital assistant battle, you need to have a dedicated smart speaker offering. Of course, the other challenge is that most people are now increasingly exposed to and use multiple digital assistants from multiple players. In fact, 56% of the respondents acknowledged that they at least occasionally (and some frequently) used multiple assistants, with differing degrees of comfort in making the switch between them. The largest single group, 26%, said they were loyal to and consistently used one assistant and ignored the others, but as competition in this area heats up, those loyalties are likely to be tested. Digital assistant technology has a long way to go, and their current usage patterns only provide some degree of insight into what their long-term capabilities will be. Nevertheless, it’s clear that the meta-platform battle for digital assistants is going to have a significantly broader and longer-lasting impact than the OS platform battles of yore. That, by itself, will make them essential to watch and understand. Bob O’Donnell is the founder and chief analyst of TECHnalysis Research, LLC a technology consulting and market research firm.

By Rob Thubron on May 16, 2017, 6:15 AM TechSpot Microsoft may have provided a security update to protect against the world-wide WannaCry ransomware crisis, but we still don’t know who was behind the attacks. According to cybersecurity experts, one of the prime suspects starting to emerge is none other than North Korea-run hackers the Lazarus Group. Researchers from Symantec, Google, Kaspersky, and South Korea’s Hauri Labs have all found similarities in the WannaCry code and tools created by the Lazarus Group, which was behind the 2014 Sony Pictures hack and the heist on a Bangladeshi bank last year. Google security researcher Neel Mehta was the first to discover the possible connection. He found links between the ransomware, which has infected hundreds of thousands of computers across 150 countries, and a strain of malware called Contopee that was used during the $81 million hit on the Bangladeshi Bank’s US Federal Reserve account in 2016. Similitude between #WannaCry and Contopee from Lazarus Group ! thx @neelmehta - Is DPRK behind #WannaCry ? pic.twitter.com/uJ7TVeATC5 — Matthieu Suiche (@msuiche) May 15, 2017 Security firm Kaspersky has cautiously acknowledged the link. "Neel Mehta’s discovery is the most significant clue to date regarding the origins of WannaCry,” the Russian firm wrote in a blog post. "We believe it’s important that other researchers around the world investigate these similarities and attempt to discover more facts about the origin of WannaCry.” Kaspersky did add, however, that more research is required before a solid connection can be made. "Looking back to the Bangladesh attack, in the early days, there were very few facts linking them to the Lazarus Group. In time, more evidence appeared and allowed us, and others, to link them together with high confidence. Further research can be crucial to connecting the dots," the company added. Simon Choi, a senior researcher with Hauri who has studied North Korea’s hacking program extensively, also believes that WannaCry is linked to the hermit nation. "It is similar to North Korea's backdoor malicious codes," he said, adding that the country has been developing and testing ransomware since last August. Others are more skeptical about the Lazarus Group connection. "The similarities we see between malware linked to that group and WannaCry are not unique enough to be strongly suggestive of a common operator," FireEye researcher John Miller told Reuters. There’s always the chance that someone could have just copied the code used by Lazarus in its earlier attacks, or purposely made it look as if the group was responsible, but Kaspersky says the “false flag” theory is improbable. Echoing the opinion of researchers, U.S. and European security officials told Reuters it was too early to say for definite who is behind WannaCry, but North Korea wasn’t being ruled out. The creators of the malware have reportedly received just $50,000 worth of bitcoin ransom as a result of the hack. It seems the bigger winners are the cybersecurity firms; the five biggest companies in the industry saw their market capitalization rise almost $6 billion over the weekend, with shares in Symantec alone adding $750 million to its market cap.

Tesla makes money by selling its cars, but Google and Apple could have different motivations for getting into the car business. By Emily Bary May 16, 2017 1:00 p.m. ET Text Size Regular Medium Large One analyst thinks Apple might eventually start a mobility service so that it can drive you around in ‘a mobile Apple store.’ Illustration: Getty Images/iStockphoto Yesterday, Morgan Stanley downgraded shares of Tesla. Today the firm’s analyst, Adam Jonas, is weighing in with more reasons why. The news that Lyft will partner with Google’s Waymo driving unit on autonomous-driving efforts highlights that tech companies are getting smarter about cars. Alphabet, Google’s parent company, brings its technology to the table, and Lyft brings a fleet that drives “thousands of times more miles” than Waymo’s cars do, Jonas wrote. More from Barron’s Next Will End of Subsidies ‘Kill’ Electric Vehicle Market? Tesla’s Truck: A Bullish Analyst Responds to Critics When to Buy Airline Tickets to Get The Cheapest Fare In the near term, all those miles mean more data to capture, which feeds back into autonomous-driving programs to help make them better. In the medium-to-long term, though, once the kinks have been worked out, tech companies could choose to drive you around as a way to capture data on you and then try to sell you stuff. And that’s the part that Jonas thinks should scare Tesla investors. “One of the biggest concerns we have about the ‘end-state’ of shared mobility from a Tesla perspective is the risk that other firms could enter the market as a competitor, offering the mobility service from, say, New York to Boston or from Santa Monica to LAX at a loss… just to get access to your time and data,” he wrote. That model could allow Google to one day drive you around practically for free. Think what Google did for email. Apple, Jonas thinks, might care less about selling cars and more about getting people from one place to another in “a mobile Apple store,” where presumably they’d be tempted to buy products or services. Big Picture: The tech giants might have different motives than Tesla for getting into autonomous driving, and one analyst thinks that should give Tesla investors pause.

Netflix confirms it is blocking rooted/unlocked devices, app itself is still working (for now) Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/05/13 3:08pm PDTMay 13, 2017 234 Plus 1 on G+ 1125 Share on Facebook 427 Share on Twitter Total Shares1786 Applications News Earlier today, Netflix started showing up as 'incompatible' on the Play Store for rooted and unlocked Android devices. However, the app itself continued to work fine, leading some (including myself) to think it could have been an accident. However, Netflix has now confirmed to us that blocking modified devices from downloading the app was intentional. This is the full statement: With our latest 5.0 release, we now fully rely on the Widevine DRM provided by Google; therefore, many devices that are not Google-certified or have been altered will no longer work with our latest app and those users will no longer see the Netflix app in the Play Store. If you're not familiar with it, Widevine is a Google-made DRM technology that works across various desktop and mobile platforms. Widevine categorizes devices into three security levels, ranging from all processes running in the Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) to not running anything in TEE at all. However, the Play Store listing seems tied to a device's SaftetyNet status (which is used by Android Pay), rather than the Widevine TEE. For example, Artem's bootloader-unlocked stock Pixel is still on Widevine Level 1, the most secure level, but fails SafetyNet because it is unlocked. The update's changelog also confirms the: "Version 5.0 only works with devices that are certified by Google and meet all Android requirements." What isn't exactly clear is why only the Play store listing is blocked, but the app itself continued to function normally. I tried both Netflix 4.16 and 5.0.4 (the latest version, from today), and both worked without problems on my unlocked and rooted Galaxy Tab S (which is labeled as Widevine Security Level 3). Maybe at some point the app will stop working, but that does not appear to be the case right now. If you have a blocked device, I recommend following the Pushbullet channel for Netflix on APKMirror (click the Pushbullet button on that page) so you can continue to receive updates outside the Play Store.

First the vpn's now this... why oh why??? Jimk4003 Surely because licensing is regionally specific, and because rooting has the potential to defeat DRM. I get that it might be annoying for some people, but aren't the reasons obvious? David Juarez But root?? Lol Semianonymous Probably an effort to reduce Region spoofing? Idk how easy that is to do on a stock device. Jimk4003 Because rooting has the potential to defeat DRM. mjh49783ab DRM doesn't work. All DRM does is inconvenience the end user. Jimk4003 Possibly. But Netflix have to negotiate licencing deals with the movie studios, and having DRM helps reassure the studios that the movies they have spent millions of dollars making aren't going to get stolen off Netflix without any attempt to stop it. mjh49783ab One could make the argument that rooting the phone may compromise the DRM. But blocking users from unlocking their phones to switch carriers? That is total bullshit, and is just the sort of thing that encourages users to pirate the content. Jimk4003 Netflix are blocking you from switching carriers? lomsha Sim unlocked phones are fine, unlocked bootloaders are blocked. mjh49783ab They didn't exactly make that clear in the article when I last read it. h4rr4r The studios need to reconsider blu rays then. Way easier to rip. Nothing they do will stop piracy. This kind of thing actually encourages it. Jimk4003 Maybe studios do need to consider Blu-ray's. That isn't Netflix's problem though. h4rr4r No Netflix problem is making sure they don't let the studios reduce the value of their product. If Amazon video works on my devices and Netflix does not that is a big deal to me. In that case I might as well sign up for more addon channels on Amazon with the mkney that currently goes to Netflix. Jimk4003 Agreed. But the studios are responsible for making the product they redistribute. It's certainly a balancing act, and I can see both sides of the argument, but Netflix isn't an inalienable right, and those who don't meet the T&C's are going to miss out. h4rr4r Sure, but the studios and Netflix are going to create pirates with these kind of actions. People aren't going to miss out. They will just pirate what they can't get legally. Jimk4003 Sure, but again, it's a tiny fraction of users. If Netflix can negotiate better terms with studios by blocking rooted devices, and thus improve their business overall at the expense of a few fringe users, it stands to reason that is what Netflix will do. Doby Gillis whaa fucking whaa. Sergio Carmona The only obvious thing here is your sarcasm detector not working properly. Go have it fixed please. Jimk4003 Nah, I'm good. h4rr4r So the reason are to make the product worse for the consumer. Great idea, now piracy looks better and better. Jimk4003 What percentage of phones are rooted though? Most people won't care, or even notice the change. h4rr4r It does not matter, if it drives even one person to piracy that is a loss. Jimk4003 But if they can ensure better licensing deals via these new terms, which will attract more customers at the expense of a few rooted users who make up a tiny fraction of overall users; will Netflix care about that loss? h4rr4r But if it encourages piracy the other side of the contract should want to avoid it. Gaining customers in the short term like this hurts the whole market in the long term. Cyber_Akuma Because yeah, people are going to rip movies from Netflix and not off a Blu-Ray.... and even IF they were to attempt to rip them off Netflix, they would use a PHONE and not a PC.... Jimk4003 Ripping Blu-rays isn't Netflix's problem, and Netflix don't need to try and guess what device someone would try and commit piracy with, when the technology exists to restrict them all. Cyber_Akuma You are missing the point, people aren't going to be ripping from Netflix over ripping from a Blu-Ray, and on top of that, they sure as hell aren't going to be ripping off a phone. And actually, you are wrong, the technology to "resist them all" does NOT actually exist. There is no one technology that "restricts them all" but several different technologies for different platforms with various levels of viability and success. Jimk4003 I said 'the technology exists'. When did I say it was a single piece of technology? Let's not be those guys who get in a pedantic argument about semantics on the internet. Regarding the issue under discussion; Netflix's job is to make their platform as robust as possible against piracy, using whatever technology is available to them. Blu-Ray simply isn't their problem. Cyber_Akuma Because just arguing "technology exists" is worthless, plenty of technology exists, and plenty of it is misused. Technically the technology to remotely brick your phone exists too, doesn't mean it's fine to use just because it "exists". And no, their platform already is robust, you are trying to ignore the fact that people ripping movies off a phone is a complete and total non-issue just to try to argue for Netflix's sake, this is ESPECIALLY considering the fact that it harms far more legitimate people than it helps. Sorry, but no, just a plain and completely undesputable NO. You can't argue that it's ok to use something that will hurt a large majority of people just to potentially possibly stop an extreme minority of people who would not even use this method anyway. That's like arguing it's ok to burn down a house to kill a spider. Jimk4003 "You can't argue that it's ok to use something that will hurt a large majority of people". We're talking about Netflix blocking rooted users; in what reality do they constitute the 'large majority' of Android users? Cyber_Akuma I meant the majority of the rooted users. Last time I checked, over 25% of people with an Android device had root access, which is several million users. And OF those several million rooted users, how many do you think actually use their rooted phone and Netflix app to pirate content? Less than 1% Hell, less than 0.1%? They are hurting over 99% of rooted Android users, which while not the majority of Android users is still a lot, to attempt to stop (and not even that effectively as there have been work-around for SafetyNet checks for nearly a year now) an extreme minority OF a minority from doing something they are unlikely to do due to other methods anyway. Richard Markert >I meant the majority of the rooted users. Even the majority of rooted users is a drop in the ocean when it comes to Android users worldwide. Cyber_Akuma Again, over 25%. You also completely missed the point of the argument in that this hurts nearly all rooted users that would not use this maliciously. Lord Argyris Looks like I'll have to start updating manually then. Or just not bother with the app at all since I rarely use Netflix on my phone as it is. SpasilliumNexus Thank goodness the 3T's Open Beta of OxygenOS is good enough for me to not unlock my device and stick with complete stock. Now I wonder why I haven't received any Netflix app updates beyond 4.16.1 build 15145 on the Play Store, when APKMirror has 4 newer versions. ast00 They asked for it. Now pirate their content knowing that you tried doing it the legal way, but THEY declined. Φώτης Because unlocking your Android powered device is such a "bad" thing to do. Whatever Netflix. Ailín Ó’S Ναι, ακριβώς... 😑 C64 How about some English Rob Google translate says that "Ναι, ακριβώς" translates to "Yes, exactly". pcriz How about some Google translate :-/ C64 This is an English website, so you have to talk English. I'm Dutch, so i talk (or try to talk) English too. It hasn't to be perfect, but it would be bs if I talked Dutch over here. 'Want 90 procent van de mensen hier spreken geen Nederlands' Or do you like to use translate with everything freaking post Φώτης Chill. It was literally just two words. Not that big of a deal, don't you think? AnubArack Is it that hard to write 2 words in another language then? Kevin Strident Yo no se. You try it. Φώτης Of course not. Actually this is exactly what happened :p AnubArack You and @kevinstrident:disqus are sooooo funny. Less contextually aware than a virtual assistant. d0x360 Yes exactly lol Patrick Ahles *spreekt ;) DavidEssex Yes. I have for years. Twatberry XwaitXwhatX This is an English website Which caters to android users all across the globe pcriz Show me what rule he is breaking. Please quote it for me. Otherwise have as much right to ignore him as he does to speak whatever language he wants. Geezz what a buncha cry babies xyz He is breaking the most important rule of the internet which is faasusu polo asini. pcriz I could try and translate that and feed a troll. Or I can go on living my life. I may choose the latter. C'est la vie, damn how easy (adult) was that ? d0x360 You can talk in whatever language you want. You won't get many people paying any attention to anything you say but who cares? Also...use Google to translate it. It's that button at the very bottom. Yes, exactly xyz Du-te dracului Rebel without a Clue Want 90 procent van de mensen hier spreekt ;) C64 Sorry i was stoned 🤣 Keletor Thank you much! You are awesome, and I totally respect you for that statement and the use of the Commodore insignia. AntiCoyote Not really fair, every single Dutch person I know speaks English as well as an American :o) C64 I'm sorry that we Dutch learn English at school :p davidus The real reason behind this is that there arent many ppl to talk to in first place, if u only speak dutch. Trust me, i m from a neighbour country ;) Me Or some Bixby xyz I don't think Google can translate dipshit. Seems to be a rarely spoken language. pcriz Um okay, whatever that means. DavidEssex How about not being ignorant. xyz Ignorant? No one speaks every language in the world, dipshit. Өөрийгөө Зөндөө Go ArclightX flüggåәnkб€čhiœßølįên There! Now put that in your pipe and smoke it! C64 Don't quit your day job Narg While I prefer English, I have to say that web browsers today make it dirt simple to translate anything, why get all worked up about this? Not using the tools at hand just show ignorance and lethargy. nasznjoka umetisha mzazi asianrage Is it being Unlocked that is not allowed, or Unlocked and Rooted as well? Corbin Davenport Both. Artem can't install it on his unlocked Google Pixel XL. h4rr4r Huh? He can install it, just not from the play store. Apk mirror, soon back answer. Corbin Davenport Yes, that's what I meant.

EowynCarter Yeah me too. And unless they change this, bye netflix account. No point in something I can't use anymore. Demoncat The funny part about video DRM is it's easily defeated. It's more convenient to steal the videos than to deal with the DRM restrictions. Fedup Exactly. Between VPN'ed torrents and nzbs, my Sonarr downloads all TV shows (netflix, HBO, ABC/CBS/NBC/FOX) automatically within minutes of them being ripped and posted by others. It is 100% automated, and with my Plex server running, I can watch shows anywhere - cost = $0.00. I don't do this to save money. I do it for the convenience, lack of ads, and freedom of time/place shifting. Heck, some shows actually download BEFORE they air on network TV (i.e. Designated Survivor). stan dex 97 new dark web premium links . also included are netfix lifetime membership links as well as graphic Live chat links (use anonymously) https://satoshibox.com/axbr7vnm6ifzk8hwtcreoe28/buy d0x360 I cancelled​ my account, sent them feedback and then just asked a friend who I let use HBO go and a Chromecast ultra if I could use their Netflix. David Gabel That seems rather dumb. Why cancel your service to them yet still use it via someone else? You're not teaching them anything. For an example, let's say you have a MacBook, and Apple does something to piss you off. You sell your MacBook, but then borrow a friend's MacBook. Nothing was actually accomplished. d0x360 Nothing was accomplished? I cancelled my account and let them know why. Now they aren't making money off me but I still to use their service. Your analogy is deeply flawed...deeply. So deeply I don't think you understand exactly what an analogy is. David Gabel So, you're "not giving them money" yet you still support them by using their product. It still seems like your logic is flawed. If you're really that pissed at Netflix, don't use it. Period. Use a different service instead of supporting them by borrowing it off a friend, as they are also giving them money (and support) , too via their subscription. revbones How is using their service for free "supporting" them? They aren't getting any revenue off you if you're not paying them. Saying you're supporting them by not paying them is a little stupid don't you think? xyz lol. So by your "logic" a person who pirates House of Cards is also supporting Netflix ? BobButtons You're doing the opposite of supporting. You're getting the benefits of their service while stopping payment and adding to server load which they pay for. David Gabel So far, your stance is the only one that makes sense. The rest so far are noise Sir Doogie Houser M.D.Esq. 200 You seen like an incredulous douch who I'd suplex onto a park bench for being a lap dog bitch.How is canceling or stealing not doing something.Also,its not a fucking macbook jerkoff its a paid service for TV on a phone they expect to be paid for.BTFO David Gabel And you are a loud mouth keyboard warrior that loves to talk a big game, but in reality have little to no control over anything and use web forums to spout obscenities and violent threats to make yourself feel better. nagi Just another step that makes pirating the same content more convenient... we should really be going the other way if they ever want piracy to be reduced. lomsha Funny thing is their content is available to stream all over the internet. Don't see how this move fights piracy as long as computers have access. This just alienates legit users who are doing nothing nefarious on unlocked/rooted devices. Richard Branches By one everybody pays... Pathum Addarapathirana Dude I root my phone to just get iPhone emojis and to tether without my carrier knowing. Like I'm not stealing anything this will just make me stop paying for Netflix. Latheryin Just a heads up. Those treating hiding mods are fake. There is no way to hide if from the carrier. Heck if they wanted to they could see every web page you load from a ton of different places and ways. Yan Minari That’s why god invented VPN Latheryin Yes but even then it doesn't block everything. qqqqqq My provider absolutely blocks tethering - I've been using various methods, including VPNs, to block it for literally YEARS... Hasn't been difficult. Dylan Harris That's not true. All you have to due to bypass tethering limits on t-mobile is to change the TTL on the tethered device. Latheryin That just gets by the automated checks. Get a live person to randomly pick your account (not really likely but happens) and it is not had to tell if someone is tethering. Dmitri Smirnov All that person will be able to tell is whether customer is using a lot of data or not. And this is the root of the problem: be honest that you are limited traffic, instead of trying to play this game of "we'll pretent we are giving you unlimited data and in return you'll only use small-format mobile device, so that we'll hope that you won't be able to use as much of it". Kind of "all you can eat, but you have to only use a tea cup and one chopstick". Latheryin No the issue is people being entitled and taking advantage of things. You have people running their gaming systems and using hundreds of gb a month. Not only is that kinda dumb but it violate the fair use act in most cell TOS. If people didn't abuse the system then it wouldn't be an issue. Also just some food for thought. If they can't tell anything more then a lot of data just how do they route the traffic properly? Make no mistake. If the carrier wanted to they could tell. I know for a fact that there is a team for both att and Verizon that is tasked with just that. Dmitri Smirnov >No the issue is people being entitled and taking advantage of things. You have people running their gaming systems and using hundreds of gb a month. "taking advantage" I thought that people were in their right by using what they paid for. Allright, tell me this - is it allright for me to watch 4K video on my phone (since the screens allow it now)? What's the difference between this and me watching the same stream on my laptop over my phone's connection? What if I just redirect the video stream to my TV using WiDi or any other technology? How is browsing a site from a laptop different from browsing it from a phone network-congestion-wise? And then it boils down to the same argument - carriers are just hoping you'll use the network less from you phone device, as it's less convenient. The more convenient smartphones become for consuming large volumes of traffic, the sooner carriers will have to more away from this scan and expose the actual numbers. > If people didn't abuse the system then it wouldn't be an issue. If carriers would be honest and upfront about "hidden" caps, then people would not be able to game the system. > Also just some food for thought. If they can't tell anything more then a lot of data just how do they route the traffic properly? Make no mistake. If the carrier wanted to they could tell. Latheryin Tethering was never even an extra charge until people started taking advantage of the mobile networks. Watching 4k videos is not a big deal, using 200gb of mobile data in a cycle is flat out stupid. Mobile networks were not designed for that type of traffic from a single device. Nor was it made to handle running your ps4 while you are gaming. Why do you think that pages are made to be mobile friendly? Not only is it a usability issue but a data usage issue as well. It's not hidden. All people have to do is read the TOS. It's all right there. Yet most people just don't want to take the time to do it and then get made about it. Can't blame the carriers for that. Dmitri Smirnov > Watching 4k videos is not a big deal, using 200gb of mobile data in a cycle is flat out stupid. a) I'm glad we're finally on the same page that the real problem for networks is data usage and not tethering or no tethering. b) You are aware that you're contradicting yourself in the same sensense? 4K 60Fps video bitrate is ~20-40 MiB/s which gives an average movie the size of about 72GiB. so by your definition watching a movie in good quality is OK as long as you don't watch more than 3 of them in a month. c) how is using mobile data that you paid for - stupid? If there are caps - announce them and make it impossible to go over them instead of shaming people who actually decide to take you up on your offer. d) tethering has not been an extra charge until telcos understood that they could charge extra for it (just like them toying with idea of charging extra for Instant Messenger traffic, because it undercuts their SMS plans). > It's not hidden. All people have to do is read the TOS. It's all right there. Yet most people just don't want to take the time to do it and then get made about it. Can't blame the carriers for that. Well, carriers are the ones calling their plans "unlimited" and hiding the actual caps either buried deep in the ToS or behind the vague "reasonable usage". So don't blame people for not wanting to wade through pages of legalspeak just to learn that you lied and "unlmited" is just "50Gb and then throttled". Fedup Agreed. The problem is the AMOUNT of data consumed by a given user account - no how it is consumed. If carriers are concerned about individuals abusing their network, then they need to flag those accounts that use an excessive amount of bandwidth - whether it's through tethering or directly on the device itself. I could easily burn through 150GB/mo on my TMO Note 4 w/o tethering simply by leaving my Blue Iris app connected and streaming 24/7. So it's actually very easy to abuse the system without ever turning on the tethering. Ravonus Damitri this guy is a nut ha... I agree with you 100% bro. Ravonus um yes you can fake it... Sure you can't block the traffic... but you sure can make it seem like the traffic is coming from your phone and not being used to tether.. Which is what these apps do.. SMH lol Latheryin If that is what you wish to believe. OK. Android Developer Is the tether solution needed even if you do it using USB ? Fulbring What a stupid move. I pay for the premium for Netflix and I never thought that I might have to cancel my service just because they did this. The only reason why I have root is because of AdAway and TitaniumBackup. I still use the stock OnePlus 3T ROM. Wasn't expecting this at all.... Kinda suck. Will be interesting to see how many customers they lose. Julian Berger Not enough to change it back... 4Ui812 DRM has no place in our lives. I suspect Netflix will have a change of heart within 6 months. Branko Xiaomi phones say bye bye to Netflix. Google go fuck yourselves. Steve_Jobroni Go fucking buy a windows phone. 天地人 Seriously though Windows phones are great. The only problem with them is the lack of applications. Otherwise, it runs great on low-end hardware, has a great UI, the homescreen is innovative, synchronisation with Windows PCs is cool, etc. dukaki Don't forget that you can use the Netflix website on Edge instead of their shitty app, and it streams at full 1080p, even on my L650 with a 720p screen. 天地人 Wait the Netflix application hasn't an option to stream at FHD? dukaki Nope, just 480p like on android. The device has to be "certified" and there are no certified windows phones afaik. The WP app doesn't even have downloads yet, I think. Edit: Just checked, no option to download here but you can on the desktop app. EowynCarter Might end with a visit at the apple store in my case. Windows phone is kind of not supported anymore. Jimk4003 This is Netflix, not Google. Cyber_Akuma Google invented this SafetyNet crap, let anyone use it for any reason (Hell, Pokemon GO of all things started using it), and over the last year have been making it even more and more strict and unforgiving. So no, a HUGE part of the blame does lie on Google for being openly hostile towards rooted users and not giving a damn about them. Jimk4003 There are legitimate reasons to use Safetynet to check the integrity of a device: Android Pay (or banking apps in general) is one example. It isn't necessarily hostility to root users; it's just a reality that Google need to be able to demonstrate to banks or other third parties that their OS is secure, and that people can't bypass built in security safeguards. Netflix need to do the same with the studios they redistribute content for; and they've chosen to use Safetynet to do it. Netflix isn't a human right; you have no inalienable right to root your phone and to use Netflix. Cyber_Akuma Except that not even my own banking app uses SafetyNet, it still has root checking and certain sensitive features are disabled if I am rooted, but not the entire app. Furthermore, it IS hostility to rooted users, because anyone can toss SafetyNet into their app for any reason whatsoever (such as games using it "just because" in case of cheaters... which doesn't even help at all to stop them). Google has been completely unwilling to work out ANY sort of compromise or method that can keep a phone secure without basically tossing rooted users under the bus. Jimk4003 What sort of compromise do you envision? Cyber_Akuma I am saying that they didn't even try. PCs by default obviously allow admin accounts all the time, even as the main user account (as much as that is not recommended) yet can maintain security. Google when they were confronted with people who were hurt by SafetyNet, legitimate users mind you, basically just shrugged them off and didn't even bother considering what could be done to allow the device to remain secure while also having such safeties in place. I mean, all these apps that you can use on your phone, can also be used on a PC, many of them available in either a browser or native app format, yet it remains secure. There is no reason this could not be done with Android, especially considering it used Linux as a base, they are just refusing to even consider it. Jimk4003 Don't you already have that choice? Your phone is sold without root access (i.e. no admin rights), and you can then choose whether or not to root your device and gain elevated privileges. If you do choose to root your device, you will lose access to some Safetynet enabled applications. You can, of course, unroot if necessary. Cyber_Akuma First of all, not all phones are. Especially in non-US countries. Second, it shouldn't have to be a choice. How many PC apps refuse to run under an admin account? Practically none. I shouldn't have to choose between having root access or being able to use a apps that more and more are starting to add this nonsense to them. Third, it's not even just root, even having an unlocked BOOTLOADER now, even if your rom is 100% stock and unrooted, can trip SafetyNet, it didn't used to be that strict. It's ridiculous to claim one should be able to have one or the other, even SafetyNet could have been designed to not be this brokenly strict, but Google had no interest in doing so, and they are rapidly making having root more and more useless while we still have to deal with all the junk they force on your phone from the manufacturer... that you can only remove with root. Jimk4003 Well, it is what it is. You believe you shouldn't have to make a choice, whereas I believe life is all about making choices and living with the outcomes. We seldom get everything we want, and neither Netflix, nor rooting, are inalienable rights. Whether or not you think it should be a choice, it is one; choose what you feel is best for you. Cyber_Akuma That's not even an argument, that's just trying to claim that the status quo should remain for no reason other than it is the status quo. It shouldn't have to be a choice, and arguing that people have to choose between root and having an increasingly less amount of apps just because "it is what it is" is insanity. In fact, it wasn't even the status quo before until Google started pulling this nonsense with SafetyNet a short while ago. That doesn't mean people should just accept it. Jimk4003 It's not an argument, because there is no argument to be had. The reality of the situation is self-evident; you can't have a rooted device and install Netflix via Google Play. Accepting the status quo has nothing to do with it; it's simply acknowledging reality. You have to choose what's more important to you; Netflix or rooting your phone. Finding the reality frustrating, as you clearly do, won't make it any less real. If this was a serious discussion on human rights; censorship, migration, justice, gender equality etc., then it's important in a democracy to be aware of your rights and responsibilities, and challenge the status quo where necessary. But this isn't anything like that. This is two for-profit corporations, Google and Netflix, who provide services to which you have no fundamental right to access, nor any obligation to use. You can choose to pay for their services and accept their terms and conditions, or you can choose not to. You don't get to pick the terms and conditions of the service someone else is providing you; however you are free to not use the service if you don't like the terms and conditions under which they are provided. That's it; it's no simpler or more complicated than that. Ranting on the internet about how unfair you perceive it to be is irrelevant. Again, it is what it is. Cyber_Akuma Again, there is no "it is what it is" argument. There should be no choice, PERIOD. You are basically saying that people should not complain about this just because "it is what it is". No, it is NOT what it is, it should NOT BE what it is, and people can and WILL complain that it SHOULD NOT be what it is. You aren't even making any rational arguments anymore, just re-stating what the current situation is and then basically claiming that people should not want or expect better. Jimk4003 You can want or expect better if you like. Netflix, like every other for-profit enterprise in a capitalist system, will either succeed or fail based on its ability to turn a profit. Right now, Netflix is turning a profit, and clearly thinks it can be more profitable by excluding rooted users whose theoretical ability to circumvent DRM restrictions may impact its ability to secure rights to new content. Clearly you disagree with their stance, and the only way to see for sure if your disagreement is warranted is to watch their financial performance from here on out. None of the above changes the fact that you aren't entitled to Netflix. You've chosen to root your phone, and Netflix have recently chosen to exclude rooted users. That leaves you with a choice to make. Even if you think that choice is unfair, even if you think you should be able to have both. The reality is you can't have both, and you will have to choose. Again, Netflix isn't a right. Go elsewhere if you disagree with their business practices; that's how capitalism works. Beyond that, you're just having a spat with reality; and that's a tough fight to win ;) Cyber_Akuma Actually, what do you think would lose them more profits, the theoretical minority OF a minority that MIGHT rip movies on their phones (which still requires a Netflix account in the first place) or blocking that 25% minority? Also, drop this "right" nonsense. No, seriously, drop it right now. People are paying for a Netflix account, they DO have a right to get the service they paid for. Netflix made zero warning or mention of this impending block, they pulled it out of nowhere for paying customers. So sorry, but they DO have a right to the service, since they are paying for it. Sony was found to be legally in the wrong when they removed the OtherOS feature from the PS3, because why? Because people PAID for the console when it had that feature, they DID have a right to what they paid for. You're just having a spat with arguing for argument's sake when you don't even have an argument. Jimk4003 There is no argument; it's the reality of the situation. Netflix have implemented DRM controls that block access to the Netflix app via the Play Store on rooted devices. I do understand why Netflix want to tighten their DRM procedures, and I do understand why some people have been left frustrated by this change. The reality is, however, if you want to download the Netflix app via Google Play, you will need an un-rooted phone; such as the phones used by the majority of Android users. That's all that's happening. I get that you don't like it. But stamping your foot and shouting 'no fair, no fair' achieves nothing. Netflix are entitled to run their business how they see fit within the law; and consumers get to choose whether they want to give Netflix their business or not. That's all there is to it. Don't like the way Netflix do business; don't give Netflix your money. Cyber_Akuma All you are doing with the "it is what it is" argument is just repeating what the article is saying. That is not conductive to anything. Anyone who has read the article knows what is happening right now. And sorry, but you are doing the same stamping your foot with the "well, it is what it is" argument. Not to mention that you are also wrong, because over the last 5 or so years ALONE there have been dozens of examples of consumers speaking out against policies or DRM and the companies begin forced to reverse it from the backlash. So you are doing nothing but hurting legitimate users by trying to argue "it is what it is". And again, no, they are not entitled to run their business in a way that without warning locks customers out of what they paid for, Sony tried this... and got in legal trouble and lost. So sorry, but you are wrong, and you have been nothing but wrong this entire argument. Netflix isn't' "entitled" to do this, people DO have a reason to complain, there IS a reason to complain, complaining HAS changed such practices before, and all you are doing is further hurting legitimate users by attempting to insist the "it is what it is" non-argument. Your entire argument has been fundamentally wrong from the start. Jimk4003 It's not my argument; it's simply Netflix's position. I get you don't agree with it, but it's totally valid for Netflix to wish to strengthen their DRM procedures. You do know I'm not responsible for Netflix's decision making, right? It is what it is; I wouldn't get too upset about it. Cyber_Akuma Again, "it is what it is" is not a valid argument. Jimk4003 No it's not an argument. Again, there is no argument necessary; the reality of the situation is self-evident, and no amount of arguing here will change it. The fact is this; YOU rooted your phone. You weren't forced. You should have known that by rooting your phone you are modifying the device beyond its factory specification. You should have known that this essentially makes you responsible for the proper operation of the device; you no longer have the device manufacturer or Google to turn to when software that you have modified doesn't work as expected. You should also have known that rooting prevents a device from complying with the compatibility test suite, and that this can affect your devices ability to function correctly. You should have been aware of the SafetyNet API, and anticipated the fact that this API would be adopted more and more broadly as Google promoted its usage. You can't blame Google for this; as before, once you modify your device beyond its factory spec, you're responsible for supporting yourself. Rooting a device is at the owners risk. You've now found yourself in a situation where a modification you have made to your device prevents you from accessing a service you want to use. That's on you; no-one made you modify your device, no-one said they would take responsibility for the changes you have made to your device, and rooted users are expected to assume liability for any ramifications and complications they face as a result of their decision to modifying their device. Netflix are well within their rights to enforce DRM on their product by using the SafetyNet API provided by Google, and the Google documentation clearly states rooted devices will fail the CTS check. This documentation is publicly available. You went ahead and rooted your device anyway. That's on you. It's no-one elses job to make sense of the decisions you have taken. You're free to carry on using Netflix if you return your device to a state where the integrity of the device can be verified. Or you're free to carry on using a rooted device and living with the compromises that entails. Your choice. Cyber_Akuma I don't think you get it. All you are doing is parroting what the article is saying. Furthermore, despite there being plenty of examples of complaining doing EXACTLY what you claim it cannot do, that is to change such decisions, you keep repeating that "complaining will do nothing". You are a broken record, arguing the same "it is what it is" argument over and over so you can avoid actually thinking. An argument (and yes, no matter how much YOU stomp your feet that it is not, it IS an argument) that has already been disproven over and over and over. You also ignored that there are many countries where phones are already sold rooted, or how such things don't effect using such services on a PC with admin rights which are the same thing, or the dozens of other holes in your logic large enough to sail a ship through. There is no "you should have been aware" because this is a total lapse in common sense and my device is in no way incompatible from a hardware or software level, but rather, the app is purposely rejecting it. Furthermore, they made no prior warning whatsoever. This is like arguing "you should have known modern cars could be remotely disabled" if a dealership decides to just disable all cars with an aftermarket radio installed. I don't know where to even begin with all the broken wrong logic in that last post. Why are you even here if you couldn't care less? You are free to carry on being a living example of "First they came", but don't come crying about how nobody else is listening to you because you could not possibly be any more wrong. I DO have a right to use Netflix on my device, rooted or no, if I am paying for it. If you argue against this, you are wrong. People DO have a right to root their devices, if you argue against this, you are wrong. People DO have a right (and have many many MANY times in the past) to challenge the "it is what it is" status quo, if you argue against this, you are wrong. And I know you WILL argue against this, which will mean that, see above, you are wrong. I have been more than patient with your insane thick-headnedness. At this point I can't tell if you are being willfully ignorant or really are just that ignorant. Or just trolling, that is an option as well. There is no way anyone rational at this point can continue to argue the insanity that you have argued. Jimk4003 I interpret personal insults as an indicator that the individual making them no longer has any faith in their actual arguments, and so I think it's time to call time on this particular discussion. As you've pointed out, neither of us is getting anywhere. It's been fun, but once it starts getting abusive, the fun has to stop. It's a shame, because DRM Vs individual user rights has the potential to be a really interesting discussion topic. I hope you get what you're after; and that the reality of the situation will change to be more in line with what you think it should be. Unfortunately I imagine the situation regarding DRM and rooted devices will only get more restrictive going forward. Take care. Cyber_Akuma You purposely instigate people into losing their patience with you, and then claim "I win because you got angry", especially when the anger is because you were refusing to understand the entire argument throughout this entire mess. My1 even if you dont have any right to access netflix, the whole point of netflix and others is making it easier to use those than to do piracy but when netflix goes around branding the rooted users as pirates and blocking them, they sure arent helping their purpose. especially if netflix is (I dont have it so I didnt try) runs on VGA and DVI Screens (no HDCP) where you can just capture the stuff. I mean it's say same withz Bluray Playback on PC, in addition to needing a Bluray Drive, you need an HDCP Compliant Graphics card, bus encryption, and HDCP compliant Monitor, and not to forget You Piece of PowerDVD which you have to upgrade (aka buy again) every few years because the older versions dont get Key Updates. and then we have stuff like unskippable trailers and all the other bluntly said Bullshit when dealing with that. of course Piracy is easier, just download the file and play it on any device you want, no internet and nothing required and no problems. My1 and even if one piece of software wont run in an Admin account, with LUA even on Admin they arent having and privileges unless you kick in the UAC, and to top it, even if the app wont be running if I force it as admin, and only runs with active LUA concept, I can still run anything else as admin and screw the other software running as normal user over (cheatengine is the perfect example for this) Richard Markert Root is, by definition, unsecure. Any time you have userland processes that have access to ring0 you are inherently unsecure, as there are no restrictions placed upon running code at that point. Cyber_Akuma And yet, there are ways to run it securely on PCs. Netflix and online banking would not be available on PCs if it wasn't. My1 well but from another side, root can also be used to just patch any holes that were there. actually happened a few times before. My1 banking apps dont have a reason for a root check if they are done properly, i.e. TANs are generated with an air-gapped extra device. TANs on the phone are in general not safe and if the TAN is able to be generated offline, someone could use an exploit to root, steal the secret for TAN generation and boom, it's over. and dont even start thinking about sms-TAN, it's even worse. also when I just want to look into what my account is doing, I am not happy when I cant do so. My Bank (Hypovereinsbank) more or less recently blocked root and well I just RootCloaked that thing into oblivion and can do my stuff. but I'll probably change anyway since they sadly have no good way of TANs (just paper-based list-TANs, SMS and app) TedPhillips mostly agree. by providing a turn-key 'lockdown' check, and further by ret-conning it into playstore access (let's see how far they take that) -google is now openly hostile to anyone who bought into android for it's ability to customize and truly 'own' your own device. the open source roots of android was a big differentiator vs something like iOS, but now that they have dominate market position - they are walking away from that without concern. (only worrying about how slow they need to boil the frog to get away with it) meanwhile, what middle manager is going to say 'no' to adding safetyNet checks in their app or play store listing? it is an easy way for them to write down on potential risks, unjustified (which it pretty much always is) or not. blindexecutioner So the solution is to install from outside the play store. That's great for security. Way to go. Richard Markert No they don't. Since Windows 7, new and default users are not Admin accounts. koiulpoi Sorry, this is absolutely wrong. The first user created on a Windows PC has full administrative access, limited by UAC. You can still delete System32, it's just mildly harder than it used to be. If "new and default users" were not Admin accounts, they couldn't install software, so... Richard Markert Default user accounts are higher than Limited accounts, but not as high as Admin accounts. That's why they can install software. Linux users are not admins but can still install software, right? It started on Windows 7, expanded in 8/8.1 and now in Windows 10 a user account behaves just like a user account in Linux. It has no access to %systemdir% unless you manually go in the folder properties and give your user account Admin permissions to it. You can still run things AS admin by giving the permission at runtime, but since all that requires is pressing a button (if your built-in admin account isn't passworded, which it isn't by default, one step forward two back, sigh) and most users are too "stupid" to simply not press that button. koiulpoi It's really funny when people speak authoritatively about something they're so wrong about. The first account created by the Windows OOBE is automatically added to the Administrators group. This means they're an Administrator. They have Administrative privileges. The fact that certain actions are blocked until you click "yes" on a simple UAC prompt doesn't stop this; they're in "Admin Approval Mode", which can be disabled via GPO if you care to. If you buy a computer from Dell (example), set it up, then go to System32 and start deleting .dll files, it'll ask for administrative privileges, but you can click yes and away it goes! Some files are protected at "SYSTEM" level, which is higher than administrator, but DEFAULT USERS ARE ADMINISTRATORS. This has ABSOLUTELY nothing to do with the "password" on the built-in "Administrator" account. That account is disabled out-of-the-box. Please, you're digging a bigger hole trying to look "right". How to prove this: Set up a new computer. Set up user default for MS. Start -> Run -> netplwiz -> Be amazed that your user is part of the group "Administrators". TechGuy22 Haha kodi Doesn't matter to me I Stopped paying for Netflix long time ago. C64 Haha Teranium TV 😎 TechGuy22 I like that too. You can even get the mod one and remove the ads. Lol C64 I know, i always use those. I want to pay for the dev, but there's no option to do that. Koko time is coming with a big update to tim242 Thief. Renato Santos This is stupid. Congratulations, Netflix. Jan-Lk Else It is also getting more and more necessary to unlock / root devices due to missing updates etc. But I'm not a Netflix customer and won't become one. C64 Whahaha, this has to be the most retarded move of the year in any category (even Trump can't top this). I'm glad i don't use Old Crap Flix. A Person Hillary, then Netflix. C64 Nope sorry. Since Trump is your president i can't take America serious anymore A Person Timeout, you're not even a US citizen? No interest in your opinion. James F Wow. Just wow. I can't take you seriously either if that's how you treat people. Not cool, man. A Person "Wow, just wow"? When he can vote in our elections I'll take his opinions of our elections seriously. It is highly ill-informed anyhow. Paul Sterling A person wins! Marcelove Timeout, you are a Trump supporter? No interest in your opinion (neither anyone smart in the world). Roy Riddex Just so I'm clear on this, by unlocked are we talking about SIM unlocked? lomsha No no, unlocked bootloader. Roy Riddex Thanks Corbin Davenport Unlocked bootloader. pbergonzi I wonder how long they'll stick with that premise seeing as how much public opinion expressed here is against them. Screw them. Get the APK somewhere else or install magisk and hide your root. Too many people root their devices and have a good reason for doing so and Netflix should not penalize them. Doby Gillis Dude, normal people don't give a fuck about rooted phones. It's just the elitist twats who do it anymore. twiz0r Dude, you're an elitist twat. Richard Markert Most people who root seem to be. The sentiment among rooters is "if you don't root your phone, you're not as good as me and don't deserve to have a phone. Root you stupid noob!" twiz0r thanks for confirming your twatness. good day. C64 One word ..... Bullshit Corey Kinard I've yet to see that... Maybe you just feel like that because they do in fact know more than you? Richard Markert My first version of Android was 1.5. I've seen it for many years. How long have you been in the scene? My1 well at least a rooted phone is objectively better than a non rooted one, but relatively and subjectively speaking, if a non-rooted phone is good enough for someone then let it be so. EowynCarter My phone isn't rooted. And not compatible anymore ! Franco Fassio Unlocked bootloader maybe? EowynCarter Yes. But seam I can't lock it without wipe. So screw you Netflix. Marcelove Let me guess, your profile pic is that right? https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/0f0c4f3e3ce40074aebfe58d80511d4a0b7d4a94896ce54d82e448a1cd2e3ceb.jpg bruce lancaster Dude. It isn't just rooted phones - Also unlocked. Elitists get their iphones and galaxy s8s from att and verizon. Normal people get their devices from amazon, ebay, newegg, gearbest etc. Jimk4003 I'm sure Netflix are terrified that the tiny fraction of Android users who come to this site, and the similarly tiny fraction who root their phones, are bothered. The rest of the world won't care. bruce lancaster An article in Wireless Week (cellphone industry rag) a couple of months back says it's now a majority of phones in Asia that are unlocked and Europe is getting pretty close to 50/50. US passed 30% unlocked around Christmas. People aren't getting their phones from ATT, Verizon, etc any more now that they have to pay full retail and don't get a free or heavily discounted flagship device with contract renewal. They are getting them from Amazon, Gearbest, Newegg, etc and moving their sim. If I owned stock in Netflix right now, I'd sell it quick on this news. Everything that isn't already mobile is going mobile. Alienating half the European market and 30% of the US market is asinine. Fedup Yup. Ditched my flagship Samsung phone for a 'budget' Moto G5 Plus that is 100% compatible with all four US carriers (and their dozens of MNVOs). Swapping providers is as easy as changing the sim. And despite the slower spec'ed hardware, the carrier bloat-free Nougat is WAY faster than my TW Galaxy phone - and the battery life is INSANE. C64 Probably 90 % of the people don't know what root is. Almost every person I know owns an Android device, but i'm the only geek who flashes and roots his devices bruce lancaster It isn't just rooted phones but also unlocked phones. Got your phone on amazon? Got it on ebay? Got it from gearbest? Got it from newegg? Yup. No netflix for you without jumping through enough hoops that you'll actually know about rooting by the time you get it done. Fedup Are we conflating a carrier-unlocked vs. bootloader unlocked phone? They are two distinctly different things, and I doubt that having a carrier-unlocked phone (i.e. using a TMO phone on ATT, or VZ on Sprint) has any impact on SafetyNet or Widevine. pbergonzi Judging from the posts here it looks like nobody who roots their phone uses Netflix anyway so I guess it's moot. But the outcry sure did get them a bunch of free publicity. T4rd This is what Magisk is for. Pretty sure if I can still use Android Pay with my rooted 6P, I can still use/update Netflix through the Play Store. Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ Magisk still requires that you unlock your bootloader, which is enough to trigger safety net these days, so that won't work. TechGuy22 You don't know how magisk works do you Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ I understand that Magisk is a great tool for modifying my system without actually modifying it. I understand that there are many modules that allow you to do things like hide root, bypass security modules, skin your system, and plenty of other things. What I don't understand is how you can install magisk without unlocking your bootloader. Back when I originally tried it out with pokemon go, it worked well for a while, but eventually even just having my bootloader unlocked was all it took to throw SafetyNet. If that's not an issue anymore, then great! But maybe say that instead of being snarky. Thomas Gladdines Bootloader can be simply locked after rooting and installing a custom recovery. Edwin O. Lol no You could, but then you can't flash anything with said recovery... So no point Thomas Gladdines LOL the recovery doesn't stop working after a bootloader is locked, only fastboot won't flash images but the recovery can do whatever it wants to, update the rom, edit system files etc. Muzzy996 Well as an example for the Google Pixel: https://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=71901761&postcount=454 In this case all it takes is a kernel that supports Magisk and hides the fact that the bootloader is unlocked, at which point with Magisk Hide enabled all root and SafetyNet checks pass. Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ Excellent. I'll have to look back into this then, last time I used magisk it wasn't as capable, glad to see it's come this far. sbeaulieu Magical Hide is there for that Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ Can Magical Hide hide that my bootloader is unlocked? Serious question, not being sarcastic or snarky as I was below. sbeaulieu It does make the SafetyNet check pass iJeggu Magisk itself doesn't hide an unlocked bootloader it only hides root but must custom roms simply delete the verifiedbootstate -flag which in turn makes safetynet pass even with an unlocked bootloader. Some older devices don't have this flag in their kernels in the first place so safetynet will accept that the flag is missing. Link to the patch that most custom roms (kernels to be specific) have to pass safetynet: https://github.com/sultanxda/android_kernel_oneplus_msm8996/commit/abc05b16bbd33521c2fffaf491c5657a94bfcfc5 https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/5b1ff3f47e32d5f57ddadcd650a5b94725bd4e6242cea92e269f51e988d0d426.png T4rd Except it's working for me right now... jonzey231 This has been happening for a week now. I tweeted it to Ruddock a few days ago. Just didn't put together that it was because I was unlocked. https://twitter.com/jonzey231/status/862122438125072384 steelew Google really needs to start stealing from the root community the way apple takes from the jailbreak community. It feels like rooting is way down except for a few (legal) use cases. If it weren't for visual tweaks & usability tweaks, I would have no need to root (personally). This kind of stuff starts to make rooting unpleasant. I already can't use fingerprint auth in my banking app any more because root. Jesús Cuenca They do. I used rooms for like 8 years maybe? And a lot of the "new features" always come of the rom or root comunity. Right now i use roms, but not root. Marcelove I'm trying to stay indoors, but is complicate... Greenify for example, works at no root devices nowadays... But is way better with root and Xposed... Doze can't compare against Greenify... Maybe at version number 20 root wouldn't be necessary... Sandeep Raghuraman What about the version downloaded from Amazon app store though? Does that work fine? TwoBit Gary It worked, but it is old version without show downloads. Go to apkmirror oculairmedia Interesting move. I flashed a custom ROM on my Nexus 6 because stock was so slow that it was getting unusable, but screw me right ? Atoqir In my country lots of stuff doesn't work on unrooted devices. My bank app, payment app and local cable TV and digicorder app all stopped working. Also s-health doesn't work anymore and soon Netflix. Time to unroot Marcelove "Time to unroot" Sheep. Richard Markert Rooting is insecure. You don't need to access the system partition except to break things. Benjamin Walburn If that were the case then this wouldn't be an issue. Nobody is looking to break their phone. Richard Markert Few people I've talked to online know what they're doing when it comes to root. Most of those end up breaking things. Rooting is far too easy and probably shouldn't exist at all. Benjamin Walburn You could say the same about anything, not just modification of phones. Maybe you shouldn't own a car if you can't fix it yourself, or have kids if you aren't a doctor. Rooting isn't easy, it's made easy by the hard work of other people. It's not up to you what other people do with their property, you have no right to say that they shouldn't. And if someone breaks their phone, what does it have to do with you? It's their hobby and their phone. You're not their daddy. senoredusty Or use Magisk DJMix No need. You could use magisk su hide for the moment. it still passes the safetynet. I too use a banking app that cannot be used on normal root proocess faceless128 "please stop giving us money and use Kodi instead" Sounds like a great business plan! JD For the sake of Kodi's developers don't say Kodi in that context. ericshmerick Hrmm, every time I hear Kodi, I think of pirated content. Guess when people are like "I use Kodi for my 30TB media collection" I stop and wonder how... Yes, ripping a lifetime of DVDs, but nah. Probably piracy. C64 I know a few how really use it legally Powsniffer0110 Yea I use it legally 95% of the time. ErectBipedal nah man, I use Kodi to browse my 30TB of linux isos. Totally legit I swear. Chazz Matthews Torrents are legal too. Just depends on the content. Mike Honestly though, if pirate add-ons wern't available on kodi, 98% of the people using it now would not have even heard of it before. Even bad publicity is good publicity. They are not going to publicly come out and say it, but the add-on's are the only reason they're well known. Andy Roid But kodi makes piracy so easy! Blian Oh god, please stop. Nobody is using Kodi for their DVD rips. Railwayman I rather say Fusion and Exodus et al instead since Kodi is... Kodi and you have to install what you want. The Netflix business plan is for her more people on Exodus, Phoenix and SALTS - not to mention Terrarium TV and MovieBox as well. Kevin Strident Kodi is open source. If Kodi stops wanting to be as useful as it is now, someone will fork it and keep it doing what its users enjoy. cbstryker Kodi is just an open source media player. To watch any pirated content you either need to download it or install an unaffiliated plugin that streams from pirated sources. C64 Next kodi wil have drm build in. So people have to use forks. I stopped using kodi since i found Teranium TV. cbstryker That makes zero sense. Kodi's reason for existing would stop. C64 That's BS my friend, Kodi (xbmc) has started on the original xbox and was made and used as a media player My1 actually it depends on how the build the DRM, if it's made to be only active when you are for example streaming netflix and does nothing for local content, which for sure can be legal (e.g. ripping DVDs in finland is no problem because CSS is not considered an "effective" protection method ever since 2007) although if the DRM would be everywhere it wouldnt be funny. Justin D Same...but with Plex and something else >.> Dany Lol I know right? I was using Kodi more than Netflix anyway so... Dmitry Stepanushkin Xposed + RootCloak or something similar will do it for most of apps for those who need root. So I think not a big problem. Abhishek Saral Not a big problem but a big annoyance. tehboogieman Hmm, rootcloak isn't working for me with netflix m477 No, it won't work. Safetynet always fails if you have closed activated, or if you just have an unlocked bootloader. Sometimes even by just having adb debugging turned on. My1 debugging is a joke right? If it's not WHAT ARE THEY DOING? I mean debugging is a core part of developing and any developer probably has it active m477 I've only seen it working like that once, so it might be an isolated case. Kan☆n MagiskSU and its manager app comes with a very good hider built-in. No Xposed needed. h4rr4r Beyond pointless. Netflix won by being easier than piracy, this threatens to turn back the clock on that. Lexster These companies don't seem to get that most people pirate because it's easier/cheaper than buying what they want. Yes, it's wrong, whatever, the point is streaming services made it easier for people, which outweighed the hassle of pirating it. You're right, this kind of thing is what will get people to start doing it again more. BobButtons If I can't use Netflix on my rooted phone, it's Netflix that'll go, not the root. They're encouraging piracy. YaKillaCJ Exactly. Screw it, I only have Netflix for convenience. This will also have negative impact on many devices and average consumers even if they never unlock or root. A lot don't have Google certification, such as upcoming OEMs. Then theirs beta roms like Xiaomi and OnePlus that run awesome. Marcelove Funny thing: I was about to become a subscriber of Netflix after seeing House of Cards by PirateBay but now through the official channel because I thought that Netflix deserved my money... Look : deservED... But this movie will keep me at PirateBay... Funny thing 2: I have a Moto G5 that I could unlock and root and I didn't it just because I wanna see how things are nowadays without root... And I use a lot of apps that would work better with root (Greenify for example)... So I would be able to use Netflix... And I won't and will stay that way only because this douchebag move... Congratulations Netflix... Funny thing 3: So happy that I waited till House of Cards release to become a subscriber... Netflix should learn something from Frank Underwood... And from Blockbuster... tim242 Yeah, sure you were. Once a thief, always a thief. koiulpoi This is the most untrue statement I've read on this website. Thomas Elephants can fly 天地人 http://gadling.com/2012/06/10/airline-transports-herd-of-african-elephants-photos/ koiulpoi Nice! You matched it. 天地人 Yes, because illegally pirating from huge corperations which constantly attempt to and successfully brainwash people into agenda using various tricks, is somehow bad? You're not supporting the creators of the show, sure. But you're also not supporting the 6 Jewish companies that control 90% of American media. Anyways, with your little money you wouldn't be benefitting anybody. Do you honestly think those Jewish companies are dying to get a hold of your $120 you payed for Netflix this year? Probably not. The creators of the show, are well off anyways. Don't companies pay them to have their content on their platform and pay for their production cost and wages? Then; they've already been payed. I'm not endorsing piracy. It isn't the best thing to do, but I think calling people a "thief" and grouping them with people who have actually stolen things off individuals which mean a lot to the individual and murdered some individuals in the process, is just stupid. It's not the same as 'stealing' bits of 1s and 0s. Again, I'm not endorsing piracy, however there are a lot of good reasons to pirate movies and TV shows. Paul Sterling You're a thief. People leave their families for months to give you works of art. Games, movies, music. You can't throw them a few bucks? I'm legit, always will be. Also, tax helps everyone. Your wall of text is just trying to convince yourself, thief. 天地人 Nope. A thief is different from a pirate, besides, they've already been payed. And I was talking about TV shows and movies, but you're too dense to realise it. jj14x Not the same. If I spend time writing code for software, and decide to sell a monthly license instead of a perpetual license, that is my choice. Your choice should be to either subscribe to the monthly license, or to find a competitor software to use instead. Choosing to bypass the licensing checks makes you a thief (taking something without the owner's permission makes you a thief). And same logic applies to TV shows/movies. If you want to own the movie and watch it whenever you want it, BUY it. "illegally pirating from huge corperations which constantly attempt to and successfully brainwash people into agenda using various tricks, is somehow bad?"<-- YES - it is still illegal. Just because somebody stole your car doesn't mean you can go and steal that person's car in retaliation. There are laws and procedures on how to handle that. STDog Illegal != bad, legal != good. Thousands of unjust laws have been passed. They made actions illegal that were not bad. My1 well yeah if you actually bypass the thing you are a pirate (not a thief because stealing != illegal copy) but branding people pirates and making the software refuse if something that MIGHT be used for piracy is on the device isnt not better. Richard Markert It's trickle-down, man. Think about if everybody thought like you. Netflix has 100 million subs and each pay at the minimum $107/yr and that's 10.7 billion. Now if that 10.7 billion were wiped out in an instant, how is Netflix going to make new shows or seasons of existing shows? It's the same with the rest of the content creation business. You and me, we're just a drop in the bucket when it comes to their revenue, but instead of scooping it out a spoonful at a time while adding water by the cup, somebody dumped the bucket over, there would be no money left to pay the content creators before content is even made. Railwayman I guess you like DRM and proprietary vendor lock in? The only moral of the story is: Pay for legit services then and watch posted content - the creators get paid and you get proper content without restrictions. The day the industry realize that DRM, geo blocking and so forth are counter productive will be historic. My1 well I would and I do give my money for legal media consumption when possible but when some things have region locks, meaning I cant import them or other stupid Ideas like Netflix not doing rooted devices, I certainly wouldnt like giving money for something I cant use. My1 not really. I have streamed and/or downloaded stuff in the past (coz not available here) just to buy their blurays years after when it finally came to germany Fedup Love my Moto G5 Plus. Best phone I've had so far - and that's coming from a number of Samsung flagship phones. It's so much snappier and the battery life is insane. I waited a full 48 hours before caving and unlocking/rooting. Haven't looked back. I hate ads, and w/o root, you can't miracast to anything other than chromecast. Trysta Noticed this a little while ago. The crazy thing is I'm not even rooted or interested in any mods. I needed to sideload the latest version 7.1.2 because my RMA Nexus 6p refused to update on its own. I'm keeping the bootloader unlocked so I can recover if my phone boot loops. I rarely use Netflix on my phone but this is kind of annoying. I suspect this has something to do with offline movie watching (which is amazing). jj14x You don't need to unlock bootloader to sideload the full OTA images that Google publishes on their website. Tim Harman But you do need it to recover in your phone bootloops, as he said. jj14x True, but by that logic, everyone should keep their phone's bootloader unlocked all the time (because a bootloop, in theory, could happen to anyone/anytime) - not just when flashing a factory image. My1 but doesnt the actual unlock wipe everything? EowynCarter You don't ? Had to when installing a developper preview. Then I left it that way, so I won't be locked out in case of boot loop. TedPhillips or when you have some random block on disk get corrupted, ala nexus 9. ilovetesla Dumbest blocking I've ever heard Bruce Wayne I stopped rooting ages ago. Android has gotten so good that I don't need it anymore. Muzzy996 Good for you! Not everyone feels the same though, I know I sure don't. Tasker, Adaway, Greenify, Titanium, Substratum and GMD Gesture Controls are all more important to me than Netflix. The day Netflix stops working on my rooted devices (which are what I watch it on, not my TV) is the day I'll cancel my service. No big loss compared to losing root. Richard Markert Tasker is interesting but never felt the need for it. Adaway, titanium are both irrelevant on my S7, I despise gestures beyond simple swiping in the Cardinal directions, and if stock Android is so perfect why do you need to theme it? C64 I have a s7 edge and the stockrom is full of bloatware from Microsoft, Sansung and Google. More than 20 useless apps are included. So yes the s7 needed root. tim242 Wrong. Package Disabler, no root required. Richard Markert No, it doesn't. Everything not necessary for function is disableable. C64 You can't disable everything Muzzy996 Never said android is perfect, if it was there wouldn't be any competition in the market or users such as myself who feel the need to customize Android. Root is not something I push onto others, its just something that I want on my devices and I make choices about what services I use or devices I purchase based upon my ability to do it. Railwayman I take that you like ads, then? Using a non-rooted Samsung without Taller would be like using a feature phone again but with ads. Having an automated device without ads and bloat is certainly a basic requirement to me. Richard Markert Adhell and Disconnect pro. What's an ad? Railwayman I don't see any ads on my Ericsson GF388 either. Don't have to install a single piece of software in order to get there. Ericsson win, Samsung loose.:) Your Samsung still has Google ad services and so forth running even if you are blocking them on the "non root level". My devices are completely ad free with Google ads disabled system wide and in all apps. Samsung loose every time even if their followers are trying to find different "non root methods" to "solve" things that other devices do without any issues due to... root. kostas110 maybe if you use some 500+ euro smartphone from 2016-2017 something that not everyone can do C64 I disagree, Android is one big advertising if you don't use root. Apps have ads (not every app has a pro version), internet browsing sucks without Adaway (build in ad blockers in browsers aren't great), YouTube really sucks if it isn't modded (watch a 30 second ad for a 3 minute movie). And devices are full of bloatware that can't be removed without root. Even the Google stuff are bloatware (kiosk, movies,music,books etc). I also like to remove alot of system apps and replace them with my own apps that i prefer (file manager, agenda, email, music/ video player) and i really hate duplicate apps on my devices. Also Titanium Backup is important to me. So Android​ without root isn't Android for me. jetscreamer01 I use adguard to block stupid ads in my apps. Now using any commercial apps is enjoyable. Richard Markert Samsung's Internet has the Adblock extension and it literally blocks everything. I also use Disconnect Pro and Adhell for system-wide ad blocking. Titanium Backup I never really used even back when I was rooting phones - it has been replaced 100% by Smart Switch. But then, I haven't needed to restore a backup (except for switching devices) in years, probably because I don't run janky community junkroms. Muzzy996 The only reason you feel that Smart Switch completely replaces Titanium is because you never used other features of Titanium that go beyond what Smart Switch is intended for. Things like shortcuts to freeze/defrost apps, multiple version backups or market management are useful to some even if they're on rooted stock OEM ROMs. They're not must haves for the masses though but some of us do appreciate their usefulness. Cyber_Akuma I hate this response. If anything, I have found far more reasons to root than ever before. Being able to create a backup image and install security/tracking software tat can't just be wiped/uninstalled easily is a big one for example. Captain_Invisible But you don't even need to root to get blocked. Just using a custom ROM or having an unlocked bootloader triggers it.. DJMix I really couldn't understand these kind of stupid moves. I mean I kinda get for an Android Pay or some banking apps to implement these limitations. But seriously, a frickin' streaming app? Afraid they're gonna get pirated? For someone who's going to pirate, they probably could just probably reverse engineer the apk and remove the limitations or basically use older apps. Do they really have some idle engineers that they're forced to implement useless feature? ddevito Guess I'll just pirate it all soon. Their loss. JD Fuck Android If OEMs would fucking provide updates for 5 years I wouldn't need to unlock my bootloader. I'm out. I'll come back when Google fixes this shit. Also fuck Netflix. Back to pirating it is. Christopher Bement My app stopped working on my N7 when I sideloaded 5.0. Got an error when trying to play anything. I went and dropped it back to stock on the latest patch and relocked the bootloader. All working fine now. Too fucking bad, Nougat is fantastic on that device, leaps and bounds better than Marshmallow. tehboogieman Which ROM and which N7 do you have? I still have the stock ROM on my 2013 N7 LTE and have been procrastinating loading an N ROM on it Christopher Bement 2013 LTE version and I was using Nitrogen OS (fantastic and stable ROM). I am now on the latest Marshmallow just so that Netflix will work. tehboogieman As long as I can side load it and sign in I'm still ok. It's a pain, but I'd live with that. But if NF blocks root users from signing in, I'm definitely cancelling and just use one of the very easy pirate apps. Fedup As long as you can side load... Sure. But going from "hidden app in the Play store" to "sideloaded app won't run" is probably on the menu. Wayne Randall I just signed up for Netflix so I could cancel it. I'm part of the group. tim242 You paid them... Richard Markert Hahahahahaha I don't even use Netflix on my phone (screen is too small) so I don't care. But man, the tears and butthurt from the root community is hilarious. Benjamin Walburn You're a very petty child. Richard Markert When something makes me laugh, I point it out. I do that even have a dog in this hunt. I only watch Netflix on my 75" LED TV. I'm just tired of root users smugness. Almost as smug as apple users. Benjamin Walburn You're tired of people being smug in their hobbies, so you gloat about the problems inflicted on them pointlessly? Petty and a hypocrite. Richard Markert What else am I supposed to do to remove the smugness? My name is…. Get a life maybe? Benjamin Walburn Why should you? Is another person's happiness really that painful for you? You already know that they accomplished nothing more than "successfully followed instructions." It seems like your purpose would be better served by targeting that, not just being a jerk. Humbling them is one thing, being an ass is another entirely. tim242 You sound like the petty child. Stomp your foot, becauseyou don't get your way. Benjamin Walburn Not only am I not doing that, I'm not not getting my way, and "stomping​ my foot" is not an example of pettiness. Your wrongness-density is impressive. My name is…. Who beat you as a child? Richard Markert Lol koiulpoi You're on androidpolice.com... making fun of the root community... and unable to see past the end of your nose... Don't you have anything better to do? Richard Markert Actually, no. I read Android police because they have the best coverage of software. koiulpoi I didn't realize I replied to you twice. You're all over this article, with really, nothing better to do, huh? Richard Markert Yeah, I'm bored. I'm probably done stirring shit up anyway, today is water change day on my fish tanks. lomsha Tard Railwayman Are you one of those Samsung Apologists that argue against root and proudly tell everyone about the perfection known as Grace UX... just to install Package Dsabler Pro because... something disturb all "perfectness" of their system? Trying to be an "anti-social elitist" is like proudly use Simple Finder on a Mac and tell everyone that you don't need the regular Finder.;) Richard Markert I use Samsung, but only because it offers the best mix of software and hardware for me. And package disablers are garbage. Railwayman I avoid Samsung like a plague because of Knox 0x1 Warranty Void, Grace UX (TW...) and pretty ugly hardware not to mention the software design, which looks like a cheap toy, both colors, design and all S-This and S-That they preinstall. Don't forget DT Ignite so the carriers can add their share. It is always amusing when the Samsung Apologist proudly claim how good it is to live without root and how "mature Android has become" when they are talking about a heavily modified fork of it. If Samsung could replace Google Play with Galaxy Apps, they would. The only thing restricting them from further modification is the CTS in order to be able to use Play. An unrooted Samsung running Grace? It would be like having a feature phone again. Way too many annoyances and no way of making it more pleasurable since the whole thing is... Samsung. The only area where there are some reminiscence of Android is under the About box. Samsung is a disgrace not to mention a complete parody on the concept of an Android device. Not to mention their followers who recently "spotted" the bezel less display (introduced by Sharp and LG followed by Xiaomi) because... the S 8 got it AND suddenly made it a "requirement". The most kind thing I can say about that brand is this: Samsung is for the Android device and platform what McDonald's is for the thing called food.;) There are way better devices available. Buying a Samsung is like getting a Big Mac (the difference is that the Big Mac buyers doesn't claim its superiority - while Samsung buyers always try to claim how "superior" their devices are). Richard Markert Everything in your first paragraph is purely subjective. I find the design of the Pixel to be ugly, boring and derivative. AOSP design language doesn't appeal to me. I also think Samsung's software suite is better than Google's. My 935U doesn't have DTIgnite, but my 935V does...as does the Verizon branded V20, Moto Turbo2, etc. DTIgnite is a Verizon thing. Bezel less phones are sexy, for sure. That Sharp device was a Sharp device, and the Xiaomi has a CDMA radio so I could use it on Verizon , but just can't justify buying a thousand dollar device from China. It is stupidly gorgeous though. I use Samsung because I like the software design. I like the functionality of the base is and apps, and I like the S-app suite. I really miss my Note 7, and I'll be swapping up to a Note 8 when it's out. Don't get me wrong, Samsung phones have their negatives - chief among them is the fragile design and the screen edge touch rejection sucks ass. But for me, the positives outweigh the negatives. Other phones have bigger negatives for me. No IP68, no uSD card, no wireless charging, no SAMOLED display. Phone preference are always subjective. Somebody will always have a reason to pick one over another. Tell me, if Samsung is a "parody" of the concept of an Android device, what is your description of the perfect Android device? I'm guessing it's the Pixel. Railwayman Pixel is an ugly iPhone clone. The best Android device so far would be something like a Xiaomi Mi Mix running Resurrection Remix or similar ROM or something like a Mi Max but with perfection added through a Snapdragon 835, 256GB storage plus microSDand 6-8GB RAM paired with a 1440p 6.44" display or even 4K. 5000-6000 mAh battery. My Xiaomi Mi Max is excellent but would be even better with the aforementioned hardware (I can't fault is existing hardware but I am taking about a new model). A keyboard flipcover would be a great accessory as well. There are no device yet worthy of the perfect moniker yet but my Max is the best thing so far in my collection beside the Nokia Communicators and HTC TP2 and HD2 and also the Xperia Z Ultra when I do the holistic judgment. IP68? Sony all the way to me if I really insist. MicroSD? No need for a Samsung in order to get it. Yes, Samsung is a kind of a parody of an Android device die to their heavy modifications, restrictive policies, low price /performance ratio, carrier branding and Knox 0x1 Warranty Void. The upcoming OnePlus 5 looks promising - they usually get their things right. MicroSD on that one as well.;) If Samsung make a device without any BS such as restrictions, carrier links paired with good price / performance ratio I would be interested. Let's call it a Note Pro. What I don't like with Samsung are all Apologists making excuses for their policies. I have nothing against them as a company or production. They can make excellent products but their policies stop them right now. It is too much McDonald's mainstream and too little class at this time. Carrier devices are typically too mainstream than the unlocked ones. My1 well knox flag is annoying but I honestly like my Galaxy Note 4 which is the last good Samsung in my opinion becase anything later either doesnt have microSD, doesnt have a swappable batter or doesnt have both (Galaxy S6 for example) but these are 2 very important things and I really like some parts of the samsung rom, although a lot of other parts (e.g. the launcher) are junk and get replaced instantly, also root makes the thing work as I want. and well many non samsung devices use the on-screen navigation bar, one thing I despise after having a horrible experience on my tablet. and (at least outside of samsung) the fiun goes on with removing the headphone jack which is something on my absolute instant KO list for phones. I dont see the point of a digital sound connection on a phone because sound itself is analog by definition and I think the DAC in a multi-hundred euro device is better than in some cheap headphones. and not to forget the features. samsung had many features WAY earlier than AOSP did, which certainly doesnt make it so much better at least from this viewpoint, although aosp is certainly getting better with every version. but even though I like my note 4 I must say that it is by no means perfect. everything is better and worse than others if you put the right requirements in. MadMartigan What are are you, seven? me me A primary reason to root is to run adblock because Google is way too greedy. So the irony, Google's greed means there's less reason to pay for NetFlix. Let me guess... shall we? Google Play Movies still works right...? Oh yes, so long as Google makes their money.... tim242 I block ads with Adguard. No root required. Mike | Homeless On Wheels People still use Netflix? Bit Torrent is your friend. dizel123 Exactly. Everyone should stop using Netflix. Not sure how I'm gonna get the shows i currently watch on Netflix from bit torrent since they won't be made anymore once Netflix is shut down, but at least I'll have my bit torrent friend tim242 Some people like to do things properly. Railwayman You mean - Do it with DRM? You can't buy whatever device you want because a content provider disagree. You can't use the system you want because a content provider disagree. You can't use the app you want because a content provider disagree. I need a lot of apps, ads and limitations for the so called "proper way" . The "improper way" is Samsung free, ad free and bloat free - and I don't need several apps because I have just one or two streaming apps, one media player, one book reader and so on. Fast and efficient system to boot. I think I prefer to do things "improperly". Richard Markert >The "improper way" is Samsung free, ad free and bloat free - and I don't need several apps because I have just one or two streaming apps, one media player, one book reader and so on. Fast and efficient system to boot. *sigh* I bet you think deleting the APKs from /system actually gives you more space in /data, too. Railwayman Perhaps you can tell me the benefit of having Kindle, Kobo and Nook instead of MoonReader for everything. The benefits of having an uprooted system, Netflix, Hulu and a couple of apps for different cable services instead of having just one media center would also be interesting to know more about. When we are at it: Why would I want to use a 3GB+ Samsung ROM when Resurrection Remix are 600 MB and the G-Apps around 340 MB? Richard Markert I dont use any of those. Phones are too small for media consumption. I don't have any video streaming or playback apps on my phone. Nor do I have book readers, but why wouldnt I want Kindle? It's the only way to access the Amazon library... Oh wait, I forgot, you do that believe in compensating content creators. Resurrection remix, really? If I put that on my S7 edge, I'd be wiping out half the hardware's capabilities in one blow. No Samsung pay, no edge panels, no pro mode camera, no AOD, no game tools, no GearVR. And im sure none of the little things I've come to expect in my UI, like direct calling and sliding a contact to call/txt. But I can move the clock to the other side of the notification shade, woohoo! Oh and does the installer for RR rom repartition the file system? Because if not, /system will still be 3gb, not 600mb. And on top of that, I'm immediately reminded of iOS when I looked at their screenshots. Railwayman So RR looks like iOS? Interesting. It looks like Android with Material Design on my device. I buy Kindle books but send them through a plug-in since the Kindle app pretty much suck in comparison with MoonReader. Sometimes I also buy from Google Play Books and it is also a trip through the plug-in for them and then into the MoonReader library. You see - DRM is a stupidity that must go way unless they create a device wide scheme so any app can authenticate and show or play back the content. I understand that Samsung phones are too small for media consumption. A 6.44-7 inch display is different - it works comfortably without the heft of a 10-12 inch tablet. Small displays below 6-6.3 inches are just too small. So your listed features of your Samsung are hardware? They certainly sound like software to me. Or do you seriously believe that Samsung use co-processors in their device like Commodore did on the Amiga? I can assure you that your Samsung contain standard hardware with a lot of subcontracted components, especially in the US market where they even use Qualcomm CPUs. Samsung Pay? Why would I use an OEM dependent payment system? My credit cards follow a standard, why should I pick myself into a specific device OEM just to pay? It makes no sense. It is like having a car that only runs on Citgo gas or a 4" Visa card requiring different terminals than my 4.5" MasterCard. Mobile payments will be a thing when a standard are in place. Payment systems requiring me to lock myself into a specific OEM just suck. Edge panels? Don't see the need. Don't like Edge displays with their optical side effects. Flat display or just slight roundness on the edges like the BlackBerry PRIV here. Pro Mode Camera? I prefer to have the Open Camera API so any app can get RAW from the sensor and do their thing rather than locking myself into the default camera app. I prefer Camera FV-5 or A Better Camera etc. The Snap Camera is good too. Always on display? Can set it up on my device but don't see the need when there are things such as Active Display and a lot of other options. Game tools? I don't see any problems with gaming on other Android versions so I just don't see what Samsung can add in this regard. Gear VR? Why would I want to strap my device to my face when there are dedicated VR headsets available for gaming consoles and computers? I certainly prefer to have a full headset rather than using my device as one. Call features? They could be good but carrier calling is old fashioned. I use Google Voice instead and wouldn't consider going back to carrier talk and text. Don't see any benefit with having a phone number tied to a carrier of SIM card. Having more than one for different purposes on the same device without SIM dependency is the modern way. I don't know if RR repartition Samsung devices so you have to check XDA. That brand is probably the worst when it comes to ROMs anyway and a lot of my dislike of them are related to that particular issue. Samsung is nothing more than the Big Mac of Android devices and no Gear VR or Samsung Pay (it is like having a McDonald's Pay) really change anything. A mainstream device with mainstream design with too many round edges and corners not to say fragile, batteries that wear out fast due to lower quality and fast charge (which stresses the cells heavily), a software design looking "something" , bloat ware, carrier BS such as bloat ware and also the price model, Knox and root/ROM restrictions, locked bootloadern - the list goes on and on. Mainstream degenerated art is what Samsung represents. But I know the existence of people who don't believe in freedom of choice other than the freedom of buying their Samsung from their carrier and then happily oblige and reduction imposed to them all the way down to the SIM card dependent phone number and roaming charges when they travel.;) They also consider Samsung Pay to be the best thing ever - a payment system that only work on a particular OEM. It really is like a car that require Citgo gas and is unable to run on Exxon or Esso fuel. Samsung just are the Big Mac of Android devices. There are just nothing "classy" over such a carrier mainstream brand. If you want to know what luxury are? Look at Vertu. Richard Markert A 7" device is too small. My tablets start at 10" minimum , and go to 12" maximum. Content consumption is unpleasant on anything smaller, and I barely watch anything on a display smaller than one of my 24" computer displays. Yes, you're right almost all of them are software features, but they are locked out when you put a junkrom on there. And Samsung Pay? Well, call me when Android Pay is compatible with magstripe readers. My bank still doesn't support Android Pay that I know of, either. GearVR. How shall I put this? Computer VR is currently overpriced - unless you want to go ahead and buy me a $600 headset, a pair of controllers @ $130 each, AND you still need to buy me a $1400 PC to run VR titles at an acceptable framerate, because while my laptop can still run AAA titles at high framerates and 1080p, it can't do VR that good. My GearVR cost me $50, it's a convenience thing, every VR title is locked 60fps, the graphics are "good enough" and I can even take calls from VR with my Bluetooth headphones. I don't care about Google Voice. Or any sort of data-based calling. US data networks are still too unstable and limited. I am pretty much guaranteed to be able to make a call anywhere I can see at least the tiniest bit of 1x signal, but if the data network is gone, or you used all your gigabytes, you can't make calls anymore on your preferred number. A lot of these things you say you simply "don't need" them, and that's how I feel about root. And about pretty much everything you care about. I don't do ebooks, I don't do movies or tv, I barely play basic games. I do listen to a LOT of music though, and yes a lot of it was stolen from when I was younger and stupider and didn't understand that without compensation there will be no content. Oh, and BTW, Knox is a good thing. It's how I have system-wide ad blocking without rooting, and how I can have my Secure Folder. You seriously think Vertu phones are luxury? Classy even! Vertu are tacky, garish and gaudy. "Look at how much money I have." Nothing classy about that ugly diamond-crusted turd. Look, I really don't care what your choices are. I'm glad you have the choice to find a device that makes you happy. But you seriously need to stop acting like your choice is the only choice. It's not. And I hope to god it never will be, because at that point, Android will no longer be a platform that fits my needs and I might as well go to Apple. Because you see, what fits my needs, is a device that provides me with everything I have, out of the box, without having to modify it. Samsung does that. They give me everything I want, and nothing I don't. And when the Note 8 comes out, the S-Pen is going to blast it so far ahead that there simply won't be any other phone in the running, not even the S9. I would still have my Note 7 if they would let me. derp_cookies So I agree this is a dumb move but everyone is overreacting by threatening to pirate content. This is a niche problem as less people root now, especially since Android pay won't work when you do it. So Netflix isn't any less accessible than it was before. I watch 99% of Netflix at home on my Roku. Luxferro It's not just rooting. My Nexus 6P is running stock google rom, no root, w/ just unlocked bootloader, and netflix is gone in my play store. Not that I watch TV on my phone... but my shield tv is also unlocked... so it's probably just a matter of time. Roh_Mish Dammit Netflix, you make me want to go popcorn time route. My current primary phone and my iPad are what I use to watch netflix and both of them is stock so i don't have anything to worry about but this just feels wrong. Between this and Amazon not releasing the TV app for my sony TV, which they support outside, popcorn time (and in extension piracy) just seems easier. Vivek Rameses This is why we have piracy. Miguel Angel But ...why? occono Distributors want Netflix to stop any possibility of making DRM-Free backups on the content. Railwayman Good luck with that. If it can be played, it can be recorded. As long as the Netflix content is visible somewhere a copy can be recorded so again, good luck with blocking. Mariano Moreira Even more strange is while Netflix app is removed from Playstore, Netflix VR is still.in Playstore. Manually flashing Factory Image for Google Pixel is how I get me OS updates and I choose to leave bootloader unlocked, rather than relocking every month.(which would include full wipe) So I guess they don't care about security for the few users whom might use Netflix VR with Daydream compatible device? tehboogieman I'm not familiar with the Pixel, but almost every Nexus device lets you lock without wiping all your data. Maybe that requires root though, I really don't understand the details on how it works, but hopefully you can find a way to do it. Mariano Moreira To clarify: In order for me to install Factory Image every month, I need to have Bootloader unlocked. Doing the Factory unlock will wipe the device. Locking the device doesn't wipe the device, but Factory unlocking the bootloader will wipe the device. tehboogieman Yeah, sorry I wasn't more specific. I use an app called BootUnlocker. It lets you lock and unlock the bootloader without wiping at will. Since an app can do this, I'm assuming that it can be done via ADB. Also it might only work on older devices, but maybe there's a way to replicate this action on newer devices as well Mariano Moreira I don't understand why Google is promoting Security by having the device fully-locked, yet still relies on ADB fastboot unlock/OEM Unlock commands to flash factory images? saf1927 Why are using factory images when Google provides OTA images too, and these don't require an unlocked bootloader, nor a wipe? jdrch It's not just Netflix. The HDHomeRun Prime app doesn't work on rooted 7.0+ devices either. Jsilvermist Good to know, will no longer recommend Netflix to anyone when I'm asked... James F News flash: when you explain to most normal people why you don't recommend Netflix, they won't care, because it doesn't affect them. D13H4RD2L1V3 This is stupid. I had to root my phone to be able to hide the navbar at any time I want and also to gain better battery management controls and other stuff that I sorely wished Google had added to stock Android way sooner. And I was considering a Netflix subscription. No longer...... Sruly J I know it's not fully a solution which is "worth it", but the app Custom Navigation Bar offers the ability to hide status bar/narbar without root. Although like you said, you had other reasons to root, so... My1 yeah, I do root for theming and stuff, but srsly they literally are throwing oil in the Piracy and DRM discussions with this. Diar I pay for Netflix so I can watch the content any way I want guilt free, whether that's their app or other locations on the Internet. F their VPN blocking and DRM. If they make their app impossible to use, I just won't use it. They'll still get my money but they will lose any data/tracking since I'll still be watching their shows, just outside of their ecosystem. Dummies. ReedSolomon Between the SJW nonsense like Bill Nye, the ipv6 tunnel blocking (rather than simply defaulting to ipv4), increases in price, less and less quality content, and now this, I see little reason to keep paying for Netflix. robogo I understand Netflix' reasons, I really do - they need to protect their property and investment. But I can't really say I understand the way they're doing this. This is a good way to alienate the small percentage of power users who root their devices for various, but perfectly valid and understandable reasons. And no, this will not make me cancel my membership as long as the app works. Cancelling membership is a silly, overblown reaction to what is, in my mind, a minor nuisance. D13H4RD2L1V3 I personally just find it a dumb move. Seems like an easy way out. Dmitri Smirnov > perfectly valid and understandable reasons. And what reason would that be? Preventing people from ripping their content? Doesn't stop them in the slightest, root-detection in circumvented rather easily as well as safety net, we have PokemonGo to thank for that - a lot of people were motivated to crack it and they succeeded. > Cancelling membership is a silly, overblown reaction to what is, in my mind, a minor nuisance. Cancelling membership is valid form of feedback to the company, that trying to tell it's customers that they are not allowed to own their device that they paid their money for, if they want to watch a movie. robogo You misunderstood, it seems. A perfectly valid and understandable reason to root one's device would be, e.g. Xposed framework, theming support, tethering, backing up stuff with Titanium Backup, etc. Please read my comment once again. EowynCarter Well, if and when it stops working on my phone, what will be a major nuisance. robogo Agreed. I'll have to find another way then. But I'll deal with that when the time comes. Manbearpig I member when netflix released there app for Android and they did the same thing. I would just download the app and be good to go. After awhile though I stop rooting I miss it sometimes Cyber_Akuma I warned people when Pokemon GO of all things had a surprise update that silently added SafetyNet that this garbage was going to become more and more common. Mario RUN uses it too, and now Netflix.... soon apps everywhere are going to add SafetyNet and block rooted devices as standard practice. Google has been incredibly hostile towards people who actually want to own or have control over their devices or even their PC Software over the last few years. And over the last year google has been making SafetyNet more and more harsh, now even tripping if your BOOTLOADER is unlocked even if your phone is not rooted. Pokemon GO and Mario RUN were a small crowd, but I hope after Netflix of all things starts using it (and make no mistake, this is just the beginning) that people will finally push back against Google's hostility towards rooted users. EowynCarter Yeah. Or I might seriously consider going the iOS way. Though iOS would pose other problems. (Bye paylib) BillPosters I rooted my Android phone to get rid of the annoying camera shutter sound, and to prevent apps from stealing my contacts, and to basically take control of my device rather than letting Google run the whole show, and because of that I can't update Netflix? Good riddance Netflix. iKon I'm pretty sure you can go in the camera settings and take of the camera shutter sound?.... .. In some region-specific firmware versions or certain devices you can't do that. Railwayman There is a better solution: Declare the device a DRM free zone and use everything else. DRM to me is "Don't Restrict Me!" and an excellent reason to give certain companies the middle finger telling them to just go and F themselves. The most ironic thing here is that removing Netflix or using DRM otherwise doesn't stop piracy. On the contrary - By buying and using DRM content you get to travel in the cargo hold with no heating while the pirating consumer get first class service: more content, no restrictions, no copyright trailers or ads before the movie start and stop on. Even better: They can use whatever apps or ROMs they want. Would I unroot my device in order to get DRM content onboard? No way!!! If Netflix are so scared - block the client on Mac OS X and Windows et al. Piracy doesn't usually happen with an Android device as a source but rather computers and HDCP rippers. Another thing also to the DRM companies: Everything that can be played back can be recorded! (Good old piracy saying) Netflix out, Fusion with Exodus, SALTS and Phoenix in. Kodi with Rapier skin is much nicer than the Netflix client and Trakt integration make this way a much better one than going down the DRM route, sitting with an uprooted stock ROM and Netflix.;) TechJunkie198 ? netflix isn't scared. the studios require the drm. and netflix isn't concerned with the small percent of users who root their devices. Railwayman Doesn't matter. Go and enjoy your DRM services.;) DRM is a pest and that is why the pirating community offer a superior product. It is easier and more hassle free to just put Netflix where they belong and use Exodus et al or MovieBox or Terrarium TV and so on. To those who now consider unrooting because of Netflix: Just don't - use other services instead. Richard Markert So when everybody takes your advice and uses a service that doesn't compensate anybody in the content creation business, and all the high-quality media is gone, don't go crying about there being nothing good to steal anymore, k? Railwayman Even better: DRM and proprietary vendor lock in are scrapped and replaced by standards. If they want some kind of protection - make it device wide and linked to the account signed in so playback works in different apps - only thing needed is to call the system wide authentication system. I am against DRM and vendor restrictions. Original content without any of the BS is what the world need. Piracy is a symptom of several problematic things such as geo restrictions, root restrictions and the failed idea of the "right of no distribution" - i.e. the content exist but stubborn companies deny distribution using silly arguments. I always remove DRM from purchased content in order to have full control including the basic right of using whatever app or equipment for playback. Richard Markert Start developing the solution, and start a content creation company that can compete with the big boys when it comes to quality content. Or, you can sit around and whine online about the content creators not wanting the people who don't follow rules to play in their gated sandbox and get mad when you crawl over the fence. Railwayman I take that you like DRM and proprietary vendor lock-in. It is easy to avoid the gated sandbox so no need to whine. It is easier to just fire up Exodus rather than relocking the bootloader and flashing a stock ROM or remove SuperSU in favor of Magisk just to be able to get Netflix. DRM is such a waste of time. It's not necessary to develop a new service since the content are available DRM free already. Standards for media and books etc does exist or did you miss EPUB, PDF, AAC, MP3, MP4 and so on? Perhaps you prefer such a format as ZNO or Apple modified EPUB that only works with iBooks? saf1927 Magisk seems to do the trick. Helios What about my non-rooted OnePlus One? It's also listed as incompatible.. '-_- 天地人 Don't OnePlus devices run a custom ROM and have unlocked bootloaders? Android Developer How can they block people who root the device from installing the app? The play store doesn't have this filter. Maybe after the install they do this check? Richard Markert If you're really an Android Developer, you would know that SafetyNet is what's doing this "behind the scenes". Android Developer I'm talking about the article. They say that Netflix blocks rooted devices, and I know that this isn't an option on the developer console. Google doesn't have anything related to rooted devices there. Ezio I have about 200 original blu-ray disks, go to cinema, and I'm Netflix subscriber. Now I won't get app updates (or even worse I won't be able to use it in the future) just because I like to use my custom rom. Thank you. This is really a bad move. AdjustedFlow I thought netflix was about providing a better service than piracy. Now they're literally pushing me back to piracy. What the heck? Dany If for "root" they mean administrator privileges, don't we already have that on windows 10? So why Netflix doesn't block desktop version too? P.S. by the way...whatever man! I was using Kodi more than this crap anyway... Miku is Best Vocaloid This means Netflix won't be getting my business anymore. Paul Sterling No worries here, when you're legit. Take my money, I'm not cheap. Give me a service, I'll pay you. I don't need to rob. What am I? 13 living with my mom using Napster? Naw, grew up. Don't have any Tim foil hats. My wallet grew up too. ast00 This is a dick move that could have been avoided. If they want us to pirate their content instead, we will pirate their content. We tried doing it the legal way, but they didn't allow it. Their problem, not ours. EowynCarter Umf. **checks google play ** No longer compatible with my nexus 6 . But nexus 4 still ok. For crying out loud! I'm not rooted or using a custom ROM. Pyramid Power netflix is just losing money. it's saying to those people, 'go to thepiratebay!' RemiV2 I guess I'll just keep torrenting then. Thanks, Netflix.

Netflix is a client app. If I can, with a rooted phone, fake my subscription, or somehow cause a major security issue, that is not a problem with me, that is a problem with you pushing out a vulnerable app to millions of users. Sure, it would be my fault for exploiting it, but there is no-one but you who managed to put the problem in place. A CLIENT app should not be anything but a front-end representation of an API run by your servers. The CLIENT should have nothing but a CLIENT ID to use with the API. The CLIENT should NOT be able to change JACK SHIT with the API, it should only be able to get search results, get access to encrypted streams, etc. If your client CAN change JACK SHIT (which one could assume is true, since you are so actively hiding your code) then you have a major security vulnerability... This is a problem with your code, not anyone's rooted device... Hell, you don't even need a rooted device to access the applications code, just download an APK of the app, extract it, and decompile it... Jesus netflix, get your shit straight you bendy pos... My1 I think their problem is rather that rooted users *might* be able to capture the decrypted stream using root or whatever and they are afraid of that. although on PC you have admin permissions and netflix has no problems iirc. Linus Monie Yeah, exactly, its not like people will prefer to pirate the stream on their phone (at least I wouldn't...), so that was my first thought of why they made this change. Now that I think about it though, its probably not so much of a Netflix decision as it is a licensing issue with one of their "film sources". (can't think of a better word for it rn..) Licensing issues are a bitch when you need to adapt to as many as Netflix has... BahnStormer Netflix is used more on tablets and TV boxes, these tend to be used for several years longer than phones and even Google now only updates their devices for <2 years (Samsung / streamer manufacturer's do this even less!)... We HAVE to run the likes of Lineage if we want the devices to be secure! Bye bye Netflix, even Amazon Video lets us use rooted devices! jcopernicus People don't understand IP and lambast a company protecting it. Of course. My1 I have never tried but if netflix can run over a non-HDCP connection like DVI or VGA, there's literally no reason to use a phone for piracy. RemixedCat well they got rid of 5 star ratings, deleted tons of shows I was in the middle of, and the roku app is hella slow and takes 10 freakin minutes to load (by comparison my OS install from power on to desktop was 8 minutes on my samsung 850 500GB SSD!!) Tobi I'm running LineageOS on my Oneplus One to lengthen the lifespan of my device. Why must I be punished for that? I'm going back to pirating content. StankyChikin Possible that the movie industry is pushing this? SkullOne Shhhhh. Don't use logic here. It's not allowed. It's simply easier to blame Netflix and believe that they have a vendetta against the teeny tiny, itsy bitsy amount of root users out there! StankyChikin Forgive me plz lol username_not_valid This isnt about Netflix, its about its content providers. There is this notion that you can copy files and therefore pirate content if you are rooted. We all know its rubbish, Netflix probably knows its rubbish, but that doesn't change anything. If Netflix wants shows, its has to abide by its license agreements. There is really nothing Netflix, Amazon, Sky or any other streaming service can do about it. The fact that almost all pirate content comes from PCs and HDCP by-pass devices doesnt mean a thing. TedPhillips at least in practice, unlocking your bootloader/being rooted has no impact on your widevine support level. now, i'm not sure if the oem could supply a high-level drm library on a pre-rooted device, due to agreements, but modification after the point of sale is a different matter. meanwhile, keep on streaming netflix on your 'rooted' computer - gasp!~ Richard Markert >meanwhile, keep on streaming netflix on your 'rooted' computer - gasp!~ I don't even need an admin account to steal Netflix on my PC. Since the Windows 10 app and browsers BOTH work over analog, all I need is an inline box with a DSUB VGA connector and simply capture the entire output from the VGA port. My1 or use DVI if possible, even better. Valerie Frye-Preter Did they do this because of the stolen season 5 of Orange is the New Black? TedPhillips wasn't that stolen before it was available for streaming? so i don't see how it could be. TedPhillips when the device can be retroactively uncertified, as safetynet mutates over time, that's a step beyond the usual forced obsolescence of artificially short software support windows. now instead of buying a new phone every 18-24 months, it could be literally whenever they feel like moving the goalposts. Mike Hunt I don't understand. I am a Netflix subscriber, but will probably have to unsubscribe now since I bought a rooted Chinese mediabox for my TV. This sucks, as I liked and supported NetFlix's business model. Richard Markert Which box do you have?

Ajmobileguru First DirecTV Now and now Netflix. I dont see the point. As if rooted users were pirating the streams or movies. Rooted users on non-nexus/pixel devices already were getting only 480p because of widewine crap and now this. Anunnaki This is why people switch to apps like Popcorn Time and Terrarium TV. Biga173rd Popcorn time still works? Anunnaki When I last checked few months ago, it was working. No idea about the current situation though. Biga173rd Okay Erin Andrews Oh that's easy, they block my device I cancel my subscription. Say goodbye to my 15 dollars a month. piggynuts Stopped playing Pokemon, stopped using Snapchat, next to go is Netflix. I refuse to say bye to root. BobButtons Magisk. While some say it's hit and miss with Pokemon GO (idk, I don't play it) it's never not worked for me with Snapchat/Android Pay/Mario Run. cliff_dangers Why does everyone freak out about a rooted phone but my PC which is wide open is not a problem? What makes smartphones so special? Doro Manekia ΝετΦλξ Ανάθεμα σου.Χα χα χα Το Μαααακα.

Loco Mole Netflix content isn't that much better these days, so if they choose to distinguish themselves by being a d*ck to consumers who care about using our devices the way we want to, then f u too, Netflix, I got plenty of other legit streaming content. Fedup Let's see... Piracy: $0.00, no ads, no DRM, no device/location/time restrictions Legit: $$$, ads out the as$, DRM limiting options, shows locked to specific devices, locations, etc. Keep on making the decision easier for us, Netflix. xyz Fortunately, the Pirate Bay is accessible from all devices and regions without any geo-blocking. berserksgangr Well, my Nexus 7 with Lineage it's not working even without root (error 9) Nick Riley This is utterly stupid! Corvus Dove Remember that time that making things more difficult for software and media pirates through DRM while possibly messing with legitimate customers paid off and prevented piracy? Me either. Asbjørn The problem here is that most users root their phone to get the updates that their OEM doesn't want to make available. If Android had proper updates, rooting would not be so necessary. Patel Nisha Root user here. How do I use Magisk for this? I have it installed and new to the Magisk(haven't had a rooted phone in a while)? Keletor Does it stop you from sideloading it? I mean really, if you are rooting your phone you most likely will find a workaround. Luxferro Not yet, but you can be sure the app will stop working in the future.

DDS This move will not stop people from pirating their content, it will encourage it. Exactly the opposite of what they're trying to achieve. But tell that to the a**hats who control the money... Ubelsteiner And thus, Plex and Kodi become even more popular, as Netflix drives a nail into it's own coffin. Znuff http://i.imgur.com/LG3dXc4.jpg http://i.imgur.com/eNeuPCD.jpg Can not use the latest version on my device, it sends me to download the 4.x version.

The Watch Sport is a good smartwatch -- mostly thanks to Android Wear. The Watch Sport is a good smartwatch -- mostly thanks to Android Wear. Highs Software is simpler, more functional Gorgeous display, minimal design Android Pay on a smartwatch is handy Customizable physical buttons GPS allows for more stand-alone use Lows Abysmal battery life Thick and bulky Needs more app support Uncomfortable, unreplaceable strap DT Editors' Rating 6.0 Scores Explained Home > Product Reviews > Wearable Reviews > Smartwatch Reviews > LG Watch Sport (Android Wear 2.0) review By Julian Chokkattu Posted on 05.16.17 Research Center: LG Watch Sport The wearables category continues to grow, but smartwatches are still in an odd place. Companies are finding it hard to sell the idea of a watch that costs $300 or more, yet lacks the longevity or resale value of a traditional watch. Technology is supposed to make things easier, and for a lot of people smartwatches don’t offer a compelling solution to a problem, making them a tough purchase to justify. The first iteration of Android Wear essentially offered people a glorified notification reader. Sure, the user interface looked nice, but it was a nightmare to navigate – and you don’t want to think about navigating a smartwatch, something meant to be used at a glance. Android Wear 2.0 is Google’s second attempt, and it’s far more promising. The launch debuted on the LG Watch Sport and Watch Style, which were designed in collaboration with Google like its previous Nexus devices. The LG Watch Sport is our focus here, and it had us interested in smartwatches again — until it ran out of juice. Let’s take a deeper look. Update: Verizon has confirmed that its variant of the LG Watch Sport has been canceled. The carrier is offering customers who pre-ordered the device $100 off another connected smartwatch of their choice. By Adam Ismail on May 16, 2017. Design and specifications When you think of sports watches, Casio’s G-Shock series come to mind, or even Casio’s new outdoor smartwatches, the WSD-F10 and WSD-F20. There’s typically a lot going on, not just on the watch face but on the case as well. Watch faces are important. Google has kept the process of switching and customizing them incredibly simple. The LG Watch Sport goes against the grain with a stainless-steel design that’s fairly minimal. What makes it sporty is the polyurethane band, its IP68 water-resistance rating, and GPS. It also has three buttons that help make it more functional than the Watch Style. While I usually opt for leather-strap classic watches, the Watch Sport is more up my alley largely because of its design, though the dark blue is more beautiful than the grey. The gorgeous and large 1.38-inch P-OLED display helps too. Unfortunately, it’s thick and heavy. It’s not a watch you’ll forget on your wrist because it’s not the most comfortable to wear. It feels like a premium watch, but the rubber strap — which isn’t replaceable — contributes to my desire to take the watch off after long periods of time to rub my wrist. The screen is protected with Corning’s extra-durable Gorilla Glass 3, and the Watch Sport has an ambient light sensor that helps dim the screen and make it monochrome when you’re not looking at it. Julian Chokkattu/Digital Trends Julian Chokkattu/Digital Trends Julian Chokkattu/Digital Trends Julian Chokkattu/Digital Trends It’s powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon Wear 2100 processor with 768MB of RAM, 4GB of internal storage, and a 430mAh battery. It also sports Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and LTE connectivity — the latter will require a SIM card that you can insert in the back. There’s also GPS, the IP68 rating that lets you take it for a swim, and NFC for Android Pay. A streamlined interface and the Play Store I fired up my second-generation Moto 360, which has been collecting dust, and the differences between Android Wear 1 and 2 are startling, namely the poor design choices Google made the first time around. Users were required to swipe through so many screens to access a particular setting! In retrospect, version 1.0 feels especially clunky. Android Wear 2.0 – which I’m actually testing on the other hand — is a joy to use in comparison. The interface is streamlined and simple. Swipe down to access quick settings, and swipe up to move through your notifications. To minimize fingerprints on your watch screen, the crown rotates, allowing you to use it as a scroll wheel or to zoom in and out of maps. It doesn’t always scroll through every screen, however: some apps aren’t optimized for that yet, including some screens in the Android Wear 2.0 interface, strangely. Pressing the crown instead (it’s the middle button on the Watch Sport) pulls up your apps. You can pin your most used apps to the top. While there are a lot of Wear apps, the bulk of them have yet to be updated to version 2.0. This may take a while, and in general there needs to be more app support so that notifications can offer a richer experience. Uber finally joined, but where’s Lyft? Where’s Twitter? We’ll have to wait and see how soon third-party developers support version 2.0 or the platform in general. There’s also the Google Play Store, which means you don’t need your phone to download Wear apps, and iPhone owners using the Watch Sport can bypass the App Store. It also means you don’t need to clutter your phone with apps you may use only on your smartwatch — a godsend for people who don’t like to have redundant or unnecessary apps on phones. We don’t recommend hunting for apps through the Play Store, because it can be annoying on the small screen. Use the Google Play Store website on a computer and remotely install apps to your watch instead. The user experience on the Watch Sport is solid for the most part; the Snapdragon Wear 2100 processor is sufficient, but there are moments of stutter and lag, such as when you’re downloading or updating apps. Loading apps, the Play Store, and even Google Assistant takes longer than expected too, but it’s unclear if this is a connectivity or processing issue. Google Assistant Pressing and holding the crown button calls up Google Assistant, or you can just say “OK Google.” The functionality is almost identical to what you could do previously with voice search on Android Wear. While it can’t perform some functions the Assistant on Google Home can — such as controlling your smart home devices — it’s more personable. You can ask it to tell you stories, jokes, and more as you can with the Assistant on other platforms. Google has built a great voice assistant that allows you to easily trigger actions like finding your heart rate, placing calls, setting a reminder, sending a text, and more. But there’s opportunity for more once Google decides to unify the Assistant across its platforms. The company tells us Assistant on the watch will support third-party actions “like turning on/off the lights (through Philips Hue) and making a restaurant reservation (through OpenTable),” though no specific timeline was mentioned. Watch faces and complications By far, two of the best features of Wear 2.0 are face customizations and complications: Just swipe left or right to scroll through other watch faces. You can set one up by long-pressing it, or by tapping the settings icon when perusing. Google has built a great voice assistant that allows you to easily trigger actions. Complications, by the way, are meant to mimic those smaller subdials on a traditional watch. They offer up information at a quick glance, such as the time to your next calendar event, how active you’ve been this week, and more. You can change which one you’re showing by tapping on them when customizing the watch face — third-party apps can add their own complications as well. Android 2.0 offers more control over the color scheme of a watch face and layout of the complications (you can also have none). The best part: If you have more than one favorite style, you can customize as many as you want and just swipe left or right to switch. For example, if I’m heading to a fancy dinner I’ll swap to a minimal, traditional-looking face with no complications. When I’m out and about, I’ll swap to one that more readily gives me important information. This is my favorite feature in Android Wear 2.0 — watch faces are important, and Google has done a great job in keeping the process of switching and customizing them incredibly simple. Notifications, Pay, and Fit Google has added Smart Reply functionality from services like Inbox and Allo to the Android Wear OS itself. This is possible with on-device machine learning, which impacts third-party applications as well. Smart Replies have definitely been useful, but if they aren’t doing it for you, tap Reply to access voice-to-text, an emoji scribbler, or the keyboard. I usually opt for voice input or the keyboard, where I can swipe through letters — it’s surprisingly accurate. You can also press the globe sign to switch keyboards to the handwriting input, in case you want to draw your letters. This works well for when you want to write short responses, but the other input types are far more versatile. Julian Chokkattu/Digital Trends Still, all these input methods allow for greater choice in how someone wants to respond to notifications. While it may look silly talking to your watch or trying to type, I’ve found it useful in situations like when I’m in a crowded train and can’t access my smartphone. Notifications are the crux of a smartwatch, and Android Wear handles them excellently. A few gestures from the first version of Android Wear have carried over too, but you have to turn them on. Flick your watch away from you to pull notification cards up, and flick it towards you to go back and even pull your settings down. These gestures are my favorite way of interacting with a smartwatch, because it’s truly hands free. In the world of finance, Google has finally caught up with the likes of Samsung and Apple with payment functionality on its smartwatch platform. Android Wear works with Android Pay thanks to the NFC sensor in the Watch Sport, meaning your smartwatch will need NFC to be able to use Android Pay. LG Watch Sport Compared To Huawei Fit Apple Watch Series 2 Motorola Moto 360 (2015) Martian Passport MP100WSB Garmin fenix 2 Meta M1 Watch LG G Watch R Netatmo June Neptune Pine Motorola Moto 360 Martian Notifier Watch Samsung Gear 2 Phosphor Touch Time Samsung Gear Fit Basis B1 The top button on the Watch Sport is configured to Google Fit, but the bottom is for Android Pay. This can be customized to your liking, but by default pressing the bottom button pulls up your credit card; all you have to do is hold your wrist up to the payment terminal. It works pretty well, though it may take a few extra seconds to load and process — expect to spend some awkward time with the cashier. Google Fit has been improved in Wear 2.0 to automatically detect workouts, and the app can also offer tips on proper technique for some exercises. The GPS is relatively accurate — it would usually put me a little less than a block away from where I was standing. Abysmal battery And that finally brings us to battery life. No matter how much I enjoyed using Android Wear, I was constantly worried on my device’s battery life. When I didn’t use the Watch Sport and left it on my desk for about 20 hours, it went down from 100 percent to 66 percent. Standby time needs to be improved and likely LG and Google can pull that off, but the watch probably just needs a bigger battery. It feels like a premium watch, but the rubber strap — which isn’t replaceable — contributes to my desire to take the watch off after long periods of time to rub my wrist. Bottom line, it’s near impossible to get a full 24-hour cycle with the Watch Sport, and that’s without even using the GPS or fitness-tracking features. Moderate to heavy usage left me at 20 percent when I came home from work at about 6 p.m. If I had an after-work event to head to, the watch would most likely be dead. Light usage — almost only checking notifications and responding to a few — fared a little better. I ended a work day with 30 percent battery, which still isn’t good enough — especially when the Apple Watch and the Samsung Gear S3 can keep going and going for comparable prices. It’s unacceptable that battery life is so abysmal. I usually take off my watch when I get home, and the Watch Sport goes straight on the charger. Charging it every night isn’t an issue — it’s the fact that I have to think about my watch’s battery constantly that bugs me. People are already having a hard time justifying a smartwatch purchase. You know what makes it worse? Seeing a dead smartwatch that can’t even tell the time. Batteries degrade over time, too. I imagine a year from now I’ll be coming home with an even lower amount of battery left — that’s worrying and makes it hard to recommend the watch. Availability and warranty The LG Watch Sport is exclusively available on AT&T’s network, and prices start at $250 for a two-year contract, or $350 outright. The device was originally to be released on Verizon as well, but after months of delays, the carrier has confirmed to Digital Trends that the watch’s release has been canceled. In response, Verizon is now offering those who pre-ordered the Watch Sport $100 off a connected smartwatch of their choice. If you’re a Verizon customer looking for something similar on the network that supports LTE connectivity, there’s the carrier’s exclusive, just-released Wear24 smartwatch. There’s also LG’s own Urbane Watch 2nd Edition, which has not yet received Android Wear 2.0, but should get an update sometime in May. Samsung’s Gear S3, which runs the company’s proprietary Tizen operating system, should be launching soon on the network as well. LG offers a limited warranty that covers your device for one year from the date of purchase, and you’re only protected from manufacturing defects. Our Take The LG Watch Sport is a good smartwatch, mostly thanks to Android Wear. If you’re interested, go to an AT&T store to see how it fits your wrist first, as that can make or break your decision. For $350, you get the latest features of Android Wear plus GPS, an IP68-rating, three buttons, and NFC. Smartwatch enthusiasts will enjoy the device, but I think Android Wear still won’t incite the curiosity of the average person. That’s not necessarily a fault of the OS but an issue with smartwatches in general. The DT Accessory Pack LG Watch Sport screen protector $2 Fugoo Sport portable Bluetooth wireless speaker $150 Born to Run $12 I find myself liking the device the more I wear it, but battery life is what kills it. If this can be fixed via a software update, we’ll update our review, but not being able to handle a day is inexcusable. The Apple Watch and Samsung Gear S3 can, and they cost around the same. Are there better alternatives? If you’re an iPhone user, there’s no reason to go for any smartwatch other than the Apple Watch — it’s the best hands down. The Samsung Gear S3 is also a solid option too. There will be an onslaught of smartwatches powered by Android Wear this year due to the release of version 2.0. If you’re unsure about the Watch Sport’s design or battery life, you can always wait to see what’s coming from other manufacturers. The nice thing about Android Wear is the software experience will always be the same. How long will it last? Smartwatches aren’t like traditional watches. There will be a time when they will no longer get software updates (presumably around two years), and then it largely depends on how long the device’s battery will survive. Don’t expect to keep one for more than two to three years. Should you buy it? No. If you’re into smartwatches and Android Wear, you will likely enjoy the Watch Sport if you can get past its size. It easily lets you respond to notifications, you can track various activities, wear it while you swim, make calls, and send texts. It handles all these core functionalities well enough that you won’t need to rely on your phone all the time. But all of that’s pointless if you’re constantly worrying about the battery life.

The four investors are Google, pan-African ICT–focused private equity firm Convergence Partners, the International Finance Corporation (IFC), and Mitsui & Co, Japan’s second-largest trading house. CSquared will operate as an independent company headquartered in Nairobi. The firm already has networks in Uganda and Ghana and plans to deploy networks in more countries. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions. “We believe that together under CSquared we can get more done to roll-out and operate affordable, high-speed, and reliable infrastructure to expand Internet access in Africa,” Marian Croak, vice-president at Google said. “Project Link has demonstrated the impact of shared wholesale infrastructure, and we’re excited to see CSquared bring more infrastructure to more service providers and their customers.” Also Read Corporate NewsIsraeli airline uncertain on reopening Nairobi flights Corporate NewsAtlas now disposing of Addis glass company CSquared was established in 2011, after Google identified a major barrier “to more affordable, reliable broadband in Africa” as lack of fibre optic networks in major cities.

If you're not familiar with it, the OS is a lightweight version of Android that maintains support for popular Android developer tools and APIs, like Android Studio and Google Play Services. The developer preview has received a few updates since then, with the last one adding support for the Google Assistant SDK. Now the fourth major version of the Developer preview has been released by Google. The most important new feature is support for the NXP i.MX7D Pico development platform. Connecting to digital audio devices over Inter-IC sound (I2S) now works as well. The Google Assistant SDK first arrived in Developer Preview 3.1 for the Raspberry Pi Voice Kit, but with Preview 4, the SDK should now work on all development boards. Finally, developers can now register additional interfaces with PioDriverManager. Being a developer preview, there are still many known problems, including Google Play Services slowdowns and system power management being completely disabled. Still, if you want to give it a try, you can find more information at the source link below and download the images here.

That would be a huge selling point for Android Things.

Digital Trends Home > Mobile > Think you’re emoji-ready? Google now lets… Think you’re emoji-ready? Google now lets you turn a selfie into a unique sticker By Lulu Chang — Updated May 16, 2017 9:59 am Subscribe Share Gpointstudio/123RF Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: Why it matters to you Emojis may be a fun way to express yourself, but they're not necessarily all that unique. Google wants to change that by helping you turn your selfies into emojis. If you spend (too much) time contemplating the rise of the emoji, you might discover that the phenomenon may represent a regression in terms of human communication. Because really, did we spend the last couple millennia developing alphabets and the written word just to return to hieroglyphs? But fret not — we are in fact getting more advanced. After all, could our ancestors have turned photos of ourselves into new emojis? Because now we can. Thanks to a new tool from Google, you can apply the magic of machine learning to your face, generating a custom emoji sticker from a selfie. The feature can be found within Allo, Google’s machine learning-based app. And starting today, you’ll see a new option when you access the sticker collection — “Turn a selfie into stickers.” It does exactly what it suggests. First, you take a photo of yourself and then let Google’s intelligent algorithms parse your face. Co. Design explains that this maps “each of your features to those in a kit illustrated by Lamar Abrams, a storyboard artist, writer, and designer for the critically acclaimed Cartoon Network series Steven Universe.” You’ll never create the same face from your face twice, as Google notes that there are somewhere around 563 quadrillion combinations of eye, nose, and face shapes that could ultimately be pulled together to form your unique emoji. Once the initial emoji has been created, you can make adjustments as you see fit, like changing your hair color or donning a different pair of glasses. Once that’s complete, Google’s new feature creates 22 custom stickers of the “you” derived from your selfie. Really, it’s an exercise in self-identity, Jason Cornwell, Google’s communication projects UX lead told Co.Design. “How do you make something that doesn’t just convey what you look like but how you want to project yourself?” he asked. “That’s an interesting problem. It gets to ML and computer vision but also human expression.” Ultimately, Cornwell said, “The goal isn’t accuracy. It’s to let someone create something that feels like themselves, to themselves.”
Digital Trends Home > Android Army > Google Pixel 2 and 2B news and rumors Google Pixel 2 and 2B news and rumors Rumored supersized Pixel 2 appears on Geekbench, outperforms Galaxy S8 By Julian Chokkattu — Updated May 16, 2017 11:49 am Share Julian Chokkattu/Digital Trends Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: Why it matters to you Google's Pixel smartphone was our best phone of 2016. Here's a rundown of the new features we expect to see on the second-generation model. It hasn’t been that long since the release of the Google Pixel and Pixel XL, but we’re already hearing rumors and news about the 2017 model that’s expected to launch in the fall. Google hardware boss Rick Osterloh officially confirmed in an interview with Android Pit that there will, in fact, be a second iteration of the Google Pixel. It’s not surprising to hear, but it’s still nice to get confirmation of the phone. We don’t know what Google is planning on naming the next model, so we’re tentatively going to stick with the Pixel 2. But the phones could be code-named “Muskie” and “Walleye,” according to a report from Android Police. Walleye is believed to be the smaller of the two phones, and there may be an even larger third model in the works, named Taimen. Word is that Google is already testing physical versions of the Walleye device, at least according to a Google developer on the Android Open Source Project web page, which was noted by BGR. Here’s everything you need to know about the upcoming phones. An even bigger Pixel? We initially learned that Google was conducting testing for two phones — the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL, code named Muskie and Walleye, respectively. It appears Google may be testing a third, even larger device. According to a report from Droid Life, the third device is currently code named Taimen. We haven’t heard many details about Taimen since it was rumored to exist in the first place, but Geekbench results for a device sharing the same name have recently appeared. If true, this would make Taimen the first of Google’s upcoming Pixel phones to appear on Geekbench. No rumors have specifically mentioned that there will be another phone in the Pixel lineup, but let’s take this opportunity to cast massive doubt on the idea that Google will launch a non-Pixel-branded phone this year. It may not even be the case that a third Pixel variant will see the light of day. Google may be testing multiple sizes for its upcoming phones, and might choose the two best sizes to release after testing. Specs The Taimen Geekbench results mention a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 running at 1.9GHz, alongside 4GB of RAM. The phone reportedly scored 1804 in single-core testing and 6248 in multi core. For reference, the Samsung Galaxy S8, which utilizes the same processor and same amount of memory, managed 1762 in single core, and 5723 in multi-core when we tested it in our review. Android O is listed as the operating system in the results. A leak from the Android Open Source Project code also suggested the Pixel 2 devices will receive the Snapdragon 835 system-on-chip. The report comes courtesy of German tech site WinFuture.de, which notes the three Pixel 2 code names — Muskie, Walleye, and Taimen — appearing alongside references to the Qualcomm MSM8998, another name for the 835 chip. Last year’s Pixel and Pixel XL utilized Qualcomm’s 821 chipset — a slight upgrade over the 820 that debuted in the Galaxy S7 earlier in the year. If this leak bears out, Google’s flagship won’t necessarily have a hardware advantage over competing Android handsets like it did last time around. Otherwise, there’s not much solid news on the specs front. Earlier, it was revealed that Google may be trying to make its own processor — like Apple does for the iPhone — to power its future smartphones. That was according to Dave Burke, Google’s vice president of engineering, in an interview with Bloomberg. It seems unlikely that first-party chips would be ready for the Pixel 2, as building a custom processor is no easy feat. New information from Hall’s source tells us that Google is reportedly testing the Pixel 2 with multiple, improved chipsets — “some with Snapdragon 83X chips, others with Intel chips.” MediaTek was also contributing at some point, but not anymore. Until Google is ready to make its own processors to power its smartphones, the company is searching for which chipset will power the Pixel 2 the best. We’ll have to wait some time before the company settles on one manufacturer — though it looks like Qualcomm is leading the charge. Display A report out of South Korea’s Yonhap News Agency suggests Google is angling toward making a 1 trillion-won investment — about $876 million — in LG Display for the company’s flexible OLED screens. These panels would be put into use in the next Pixel devices, and lessen Google’s dependence on Samsung, which outfits its own flagship smartphones with curved displays. It’s also pegged as a win for LG as well, which would like to ramp up OLED production and shift away from LCDs, according to the article. The result could be a strategic partnership between the two companies, rather than a simple order. While we haven’t heard much about the Pixel featuring a curved screen up until now, it does fall in line with a rapidly increasing trend in the industry. In addition to Samsung and its Galaxy S8, Apple is rumored to utilize a flexible OLED panel in its iPhone X. Although we can’t verify the validity of this report, it wouldn’t be surprising to see Google move in a similar direction with the Pixel later this year. Design We have yet to see any leaked photos of the Google Pixel 2, but recent reports indicate that Google may follow Apple’s lead with an interesting design choice — the removal of the headphone jack. The report comes from 9to5Google and it cites internal Google documentation suggesting that the company will remove the headphone jack in favor of a single USB-C port. Android fans would undoubtedly be frustrated by the news — however, keep in mind that the news has yet to be confirmed (and 9to5Google is only 60 percent sure of the rumor). If it does prove to be true, there would certainly be a slew of accessories for helping people connect their 3.5mm headphones to their device. A budget Pixel Early on in the Pixel 2 rumors, we heard that there could be a more budget-friendly Pixel device called the Pixel 2B. Most recently, however, it seems like that device could eventually get a release — but it won’t be released under the Pixel name. The news comes from a 9to5Google tipster, who claims that while the Pixel team isn’t working on a Pixel branded budget-friendly device, it is working on a budget-friendly device to be released with a different name. This could be launched under the Android One program, or a new name entirely. The news makes sense. In the Android Pit interview, Rick Osterloh went on to say that the Pixel will “stay premium.” We won’t know what that means until the Pixel 2 is launched, but don’t expect Nexus-style pricing on a Pixel phone. We first heard of a budget Pixel device at the end of January, when it was revealed that Google was testing a few prototypes of a device code-named the “Pixel 2B.” The report came from 9to5Google, which also said that the device would cost a lot less than $650, with the compromise of less-powerful hardware. This device, which may launch alongside the Pixel 2 or after, will be intended to be released in “different markets.” An even better camera The Google Pixel was praised for its stellar camera that rivaled the iPhone 7 Plus, and it seems as though Google is prioritizing it again for the second-generation device. That’s according to a source speaking to Stephan Hall at 9to5Google. We cannot verify this source’s claims, and we’re a long time away from the release date, so things can change. The source said Google is looking to perfect the low-light capabilities of the next Pixel, but it will “not have large [megapixel] size.” Google will reportedly compensate for this with extra features. Waterproof Pixel? Hall posted a tweet that the next-generation Pixel will be waterproof — information he received at the Google event last October. Going by what Apple and Samsung have done for their flagship devices, the Pixel 2 will likely be IP67- or IP68-rated, allowing for water submersion up to 1 to 1.5 meters for 30 minutes. But Hall now says waterproofing may not be so definite anymore. His source said the feature is “still on the table” for the Pixel 2 — which is hardly as concrete as “definitely.” Little tidbit we were told in October last year that I forgot about: “Waterproofing definitely coming with next Pixel device.” &mdash; Stephen Hall (@hallstephenj) January 25, 2017 The reason it wasn’t in the current Pixel? Google ran out of time. According to a Wired podcast, Google said it threw out plans for the device at the end of 2015 and had to start from scratch — meaning the phone was built in a mere nine months. Huawei was supposed to manufacture the device, but the company backed out when Google demanded there be no Huawei logo. HTC took Huawei’s place. Release date and price Google has traditionally unveiled its Nexus smartphones, as well as last year’s Pixel, during a fall event. We’ll likely see the Pixel 2, as well as the Pixel 2 XL (Pixel XXL?) in October. Unfortunately, you may see a price increase for the flagship Pixel 2. Hall’s source said Google is expecting “at least” a $50 price jump for the device, but the Pixel 2B will be “significantly cheaper.” Keep in mind, the company is months away from a release date and all of this is subject to change. We’ll update this post as we learn more about the 2017 Pixel 2 and the Pixel 2B. Article originally published in January 2017. Updated on 05-16-2017 by Adam Ismail: Added Taimen Geekbench results.
Digital Trends Home > Mobile > HTC U11 vs. Samsung Galaxy S8: Which flagship… HTC U11 vs. Samsung Galaxy S8: Which flagship reigns supreme? By Kyle Wiggers — Updated May 16, 2017 9:02 am Subscribe Share Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: The HTC U11 is a compelling smartphone. It boasts the company’s UltraPixel camera — which is now the highest scored smartphone camera on DxOMark — and it’s powered by Qualcomm’s new Snapdragon 835 processor, with an AI-powered assistant for good measure. But Samsung’s Galaxy S8, its prime competition, is no less a powerhouse. It sports the same Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor as the U11, plus wireless charging, a water-resistant design, and Bixby, Samsung’s own AI-powered assistant. Which phone gives you more bang for your buck? We pit the HTC U11 against the Samsung Galaxy S8 in a hardware battle to the finish. Specs and performance HTC U11   Samsung Galaxy S8   Size  153.9 x 75.9 x 7.9 mm (6.06 x 2.99 x 0.31 in) 159.5 x 73.4 x 8.1 mm (6.28 x 2.89 x 0.32 in) Weight  5.96 ounces (169 grams) 6.2 ounces (173 grams) Screen  5.5-inch Quad HD Super LCD 5.8-inch Quad HD Super AMOLED Resolution  2,560 x 1,440 pixels 2,960×1,440 pixels OS Android 7.1 Nougat Android 7.0 Nougat Storage  64 (U.S.) 128GB (International) 64 (U.S.) 128GB (International) SD Card Slot Yes Yes NFC support Yes Yes Processor Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 RAM  4GB (U.S.) 6GB (International) 4GB Connectivity GSM / CDMA / HSPA / LTE GSM / CDMA / HSPA / LTE Camera  Front 16MP, Rear 12MP with OIS Front 8MP, Rear 12MP with OIS Video  4K 4K Bluetooth Yes, version 4.2 Yes, version 5 Fingerprint sensor Yes Yes Other sensors Edge Sensor, barometer, gyroscope, accelerometer, compass, proximity sensor Barometer, gyroscope, accelerometer, compass, heart rate, proximity sensor, iris scanner Water Resistant Yes, IP67 Yes, IP68 Battery  3,000mAh 3,000mAh Charger  USB Type-C USB Type-C Quick Charging Yes Yes Wireless Charging No Yes, Qi and PMA Marketplace Google Play Store Google Play Store Color offerings Blue, black, white, gray, red Black, silver, gray, blue, gold Availability Unlocked, Sprint AT&T, Verizon, Sprint, T-Mobile DT Review Hands On 4 out of 5 stars You’d have a tough time telling the U11 and Galaxy S8 apart from internals alone. Both phones share 4GB of RAM and a base storage of 64GB (some markets will have 6GB of RAM and 128GB for both). They’re both have MicroSD card slots in case you need more storage, and they’re powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 835, the flagship processor in the chip maker’s arsenal. In most apps and real-world scenario, the processor bests its predecessor, the Snapdragon 821, handily. Benchmarks show the 821 earned a respectable 141,092 on AnTuTu, but the Snapdragon 835 went above and beyond, hitting a hefty 183,227. These two phones are certainly more powerful than any other Android phone on the market. If there’s one major spec advantage the Galaxy S8 has over the U11, it’s Bluetooth. The Galaxy S8 utilizes Bluetooth 5, which has 4 times the range of Bluetooth 4.2, which is what the U11 uses. It also has 2 times the data speed, and it can pair to two different devices at the same time. It’s too early to tell whether the respective optimizations HTC and Samsung have made will confer meaningful advantages. But for now, we’re calling this round a tie. Winner: Tie Design Julian Chokkattu/Digital Trends The U11 and Galaxy S8 might not be all that different on the inside. But from the outside, they couldn’t look less alike. The U11 boasts HTC’s bright “liquid surface,” a glass back specially designed to shine and shimmer in the light. There’s a lot of unused space on the front, with sizable edges between the screen and edges. The Galaxy S8, by contrast, is mostly curves. It features rounded glass and metal with a big screen and minimal edges, and a massive screen that stretches the edges back on all sides. The haptic home button, which sits under the Galaxy S8’s display, is a nice touch. We can’t stop staring at the front of the S8, but the rear isn’t as pretty. The fingerprint sensor is in an awkward position next to the camera module. The U11 doesn’t have that problems — its oval-shaped fingerprint sensor is on the front, below the screen, and its primary shooter is flush with the rear cover. The U11’s edges curve gradually, but it’s the back we can’t stop looking at — it’s simply gorgeous. Both the Galaxy S8 and the U11 are water resistant, with an IP68 and IP67-rating, respectively. The Galaxy S8 has a slight improvement in depth here, but it’s not enough to decry the U11. Both the Galaxy S8 and U11 pack USB Type-C charging ports. But unlike the Galaxy S8, the U11 eschews the standard 3.5mm headphone jack. HTC justifies it with its USB-C USonic headphones that comes with the phone — the U11 can power active noise cancelling tech to the earbuds, and it’s a feat made possible with the USB Type-C port. The U11 also packs four microphones that record high-quality sound from a distance, and it’s optimal for using voice assistants like Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant. But despite the U11’s audio prowess, we’re not convinced that noise-canceling headphones were a great reason to do away with the 3.5mm headphone jack. As pretty as the U11’s liquid metal material is, it’s no match for the Galaxy S8’s futuristic, curved screen. For those reasons, we’re handing the Galaxy S8 the win. Winner: Galaxy S8 Display The U11 and Galaxy S8’s screens may be roughly the same size, but the technology couldn’t be more different. The U11’s 5.5-inch Quad HD (2,560 x 1,440 pixels) is Super LCD, meaning it’s illuminated with a backlight. The Galaxy S8’s 5.8-inch screen, meanwhile, is Super AMOLED, and it produces some of the brightest and most colorful images we’ve seen on a smartphone. As an added bonus, the Galaxy S8’s screen supports high-dynamic range (HDR) content, which means it boasts greater color volume. Samsung produces the best displays, and the Galaxy S8 blows the competition — including the U11 — away in terms of color accuracy, contrast, and black levels. Winner: Galaxy S8 Battery life and charging Julian Chokkattu/Digital Trends The U11 and Galaxy S8 share the same 3,000mAh battery capacity. HTC estimates the U11’s battery life at 24.5 hours on 3G/4G, and up to 14 days on standby. Samsung’s Galaxy S8 lasts just about as long. In our review, it made it about a day on a charge — we ended with about 25 percent around 8 p.m. after a day of taking photos, music streaming, and browsing. We’ll see how the U11 measures in our review, but expect a similar result as the S8. Both phones charge quickly. The U11 supports Qualcomm’s Quick Charge 3.0 standard, which delivers roughly 1 hour of battery power for every 1 minute of charge. And the Galaxy S8 uses Samsung’s Adaptive Fast Charge, and supports wireless charging (QI/PMA). It’s a close call, and we’ll have to see if the HTC’s software optimizations — or lack of — make a day-to-day difference. But for now, the Galaxy S8’s wireless charging features are enough to win it this round. Winner: Galaxy S8 Camera HTC’s stuck with its in-house UltraPixel tech with the U11. The rear 12-megapixel camera a f/1.7 aperture, an optical image stabilization (OIS) system that mitigates shaky hands and bumpy car rides, and a dual-tone LED flash module. The S8 sports a 12-megapixel camera that’s an excellent low-light performer. All the extras you’d expect are here, including optical image stabilization. In our testing, we were impressed by the Galaxy S8’s ability to produce great shots in tricky lighting conditions. The Galaxy S8’s front 8-megapixel camera isn’t anything to write home about, but we appreciate the wide-angle mode — especially for big group selfies. DxOMark has rated the U11’s camera as the best smartphone camera with a score of 90, narrowly beating out Google’s Pixel, and the Galaxy S8. We’ll have to test this out further before claiming a winner. Winner: Tie Software The U11 ships with Android 7.1.1, which is slightly more recent than Android 7.0 on the Galaxy S8. It’s layered over with HTC Sense, the company’s Android skin, which isn’t too far off from stock Android. Similarly, the Galaxy S8 ships with TouchWiz, which has greatly improved in design, and isn’t as power intensive as previous versions. The Galaxy S8 offers features such as Edge Panel, which lets you stick shortcuts to the curved edges of the Galaxy S8’s screen. There’s Smart Stay, which keeps the screen on as long as your eyes are staring at it, and multitasking options let you reverse the app position with a tap. One of the Galaxy S8’s headlining features is Bixby, an artificially intelligent assistant in four parts: Bixby Home, Reminder, Vision, and Voice. Bixby Home is a dedicated screen that shows you information like your current step count, your next calendar event, the weather, what’s trending on Twitter, and even random GIFs from Giphy. Bixby Reminders surfaces tasks and images you want to be reminded of later on. Bixby Vision recognizes objects and suggests relevant Amazon search links and more. And Bixby Voice lets you perform actions with voice commands. The U11 has Sense Companion, an artificially intelligent assistant that taps signals like your current location, activity level, and calendar to anticipate your needs. If your battery’s at 50 percent and you have a long-distance flight ahead of you, for example, Sense Companion will remind you to charge your smartphone. If it’s lunchtime, it’ll plop a link to a highly-rated nearby restaurant on your lock screen. Alternatively, the U11 offers access to the Google Assistant (as does the S8), and to Amazon’s Alexa. The U11 has touch-sensitive edges — it’s a part of a new feature called Edge Sense. It’s triggered by squeezing the bottom portion of the phone’s frame. Like the Convenience Key on the new BlackBerry Key One, it’s programmable — you can use it to launch apps, take photos, and more. We think this will prove more useful, as well as Sense Companion, than Bixby — at least in Bixby’s current state. The HTC U11 will get monthly security updates, an HTC spokesperson told Digital Trends. Samsung should be following through with the S8, but HTC has been quicker to issue updates — especially Android version updates. It’s also already on a more recent version. The U11 gets the win here, but it’s narrow. Winner: HTC U11 Price and availability HTC U11 is available unlocked on HTC’s website and Amazon for $650. It’ll be compatible with Verizon, AT&T, and T-Mobile networks, but Sprint is the only carrier that’ll sell it directly at launch. It’s available on the carrier for $29 per month for 24 months, or $696 at full price. The HTC U11 is available for pre-order now, and will start shipping in June. The Galaxy S8, by comparison, starts at $725 unlocked. Alternatively, it’s available from Verizon, Sprint, AT&T, T-Mobile, Amazon, B&H, and other retailers for between $720 and $750. Galaxy S8 HTC U11 Verizon $720, or $30 per month for 24 months N/A Sprint $750, or $31.25 per month for 24 months $696, or $29 per month for 24 months AT&T $750, or $25 per month for 30 months N/A T-Mobile $750, or $30 per month for 24 months N/A Unlocked $725 $650 The HTC U11 may not be available from as many retailers as the Galaxy S8, but it’s quite a bit cheaper. That’s enough to win it this round. Winner: HTC U11 Overall winner: Galaxy S8 It’s a narrow win for sure, and the Galaxy S8’s win does not mean the U11 isn’t a good phone. The Galaxy S8 is better — its curved AMOLED screen is fantastic for consuming media, it has superior Bluetooth connectivity, it supports wireless charging, and it has a headphone jack. That’s not to discount the U11’s Edge Sense, liquid metal display, or Sense Companion, all of which are innovations worth celebrating. You also save some money going for the U11.

What to expect from Google I/O 2017 Posted 11 hours ago by Darrell Etherington (@etherington) 0 SHARES Next Story Lisnr’s data-over-audio technology aims to replace QR code scanning, NFC Google’s annual I/O developer conference starts on Wednesday, and the 2017 edition of the show should be full of news and announcements, just like every year before now. Typically, we see lots in the way of new versions of Google apps, new software features and even major operating system updates – all of those are likely to be revealed during tomorrow’s keynote at 10 AM PT (which we’ll be live blogging). But this year’s show could also have some surprises in store in terms of hardware and powerful developer tools. Android The next version of Google’s mobile OS — Android O — will likely be revealed in full detail at the event. The successor to Nougat will have some big shoes to fill, since the last revision included some significant additions like Google Assistant, but you can expect Google to pack in plenty of additions. We already know some things about what’s coming in Android O, because there’s already a developer preview available to download and work with for dedicated tinkerers. The dev preview has tipped new features, including Notifications Channels to group relevant notifications together; picture-in-picture for web and in-app video; multi-display support for individual apps; in-app navigation using hardware keyboards (like on Chromebooks); new networking features and more. As for names, Google has made some time-ups including a mobile game and teasing exec tweets that suggest Oreo will be the moniker, similar to how it partnered with Kit-Kat for Android K. I can’t think of any other ‘O’ desserts of the top of my head, so it seems like a good bet. In terms of what kind of actual software release we can expect, it’s probable we still have to wait for a consumer release. Instead, expect maybe an OTA, easier-to-access version of the developer preview, with more general stability and perhaps some added features. We’ll also probably find out that Android O will be released for general consumers starting this fall. Also Android Google is likely to spend some time talking about other places Android is going to work beyond smartphones and tablets. That could include updates to its crossover functionality with Chromebooks, for instance, which debuted earlier this year but which critics basically universally said still needs work before it’s ready for prime time. Google itself also gave us something to look for specifically: More Android in the car. The OS is branching out from Android Auto to take over tasks related to cockpit and environment controls, and Google will have two test vehicles on site to show off what that looks like, with initial partners Audi and Volvo. Finally, there are some hints that suggest Android Pay could roll out to a few additional markets. A website for Visa in Canada showed a mention of Android Pay, and it also showed up in a recent APK as well as on Android devices in Canada via an update, before being pulled back again. VR Virtual reality has been an area of ongoing evolution for Google, culminating most recently in Daydream, the built-in VR platform for Android. Daydream debuted with the Pixel last year alongside Android N, and has expanded out to a few other devices, including the Moto Z. Android O could bring additional VR features to Daydream, and it’s possible that Google will also reveal new partners for Daydream on both the hardware and software side. There could also be more around Tango, the depth sensing camera tech that has been built into a few devices but that could ultimately do a lot more specific to VR, including adding inside-out environment tracking. Android Wear Google already updated Android Wear to version 2.0, building in a host of new features and debuting the platform iteration with a slate of new hardware, including showcase devices from LG. It might make sense to preview additional Wear features or updates again, even though it hasn’t been that long since the 2.0 update went live. Wearables is still a category with questionable value for both OEMs and platform operators, basically across the board. Android Wear is still among the options out there with the most potential, but it’ll be very interesting to see how hard Google pushes Wear and Wear-related tech and development features at I/O. This could be a good opportunity to take the temperature of the search giant on its overall wearable ambitions. Google Home and Assistant Google is likely to show us a lot around Google Assistant, and we’ll likely get a look at some of the first partner hardware to sport Home-like Assistant features built-in. One likely specific launch is the Nvidia Spot, an AI assistant microphone that you can plug into any outlet and use with a Shield streaming set-top box for whole home Assistant integration. Expect Assistant to reach further and get smarter, with more built-in features, more third-party integrations, and more platforms. Google doesn’t want to cede this ground to Amazon and Alexa, and it’s probably going to be a central theme of the I/O keynote, especially because I/O is all about rallying developers to build experiences for Google’s priority platforms. Lots more This is one of the  I/O events in recent memory that we know the least about, so you can expect plenty more beyond what we’ve listed here (and a lot of this is also just guesswork). We’ll be there live with our keynote starting early tomorrow AM before the 10 AM PT kick-off time. There’s also a Developer Keynote later in the day, so stick around for plenty of news from that, too.

Siri might not be too happy about her new roommate. Image: brittany herbert/mashable By Brett Williams2017-05-16 11:25:40 -0700 Move over, Siri: your iPhone might soon welcome another AI assistant into the iOS fold.  Google could throw the smartphone world for a loop at this week's I/O developers conference and unveil new Google Assistant functionality for the iPhone, according to Bloomberg. The report, which cites "a person familiar with the matter," claims the Assistant-to-iOS news could be announced as early as the first day of the event.    Assistant will come to the iPhone in the form of a free iOS app, the source said, and will depend on voice commands to work with other Google apps installed on users' phones. You'll presumably be able to ask Assistant to queue up videos on YouTube or even read off emails from Inbox, to name a few potential uses.  SEE ALSO: Google's Assistant is headed to a lot more hardware Amazon's Alexa is already available on the iPhone, although much of its functionality is restricted to Amazon's shopping app. You can also use the standalone Alexa app to control Echo devices and messaging and calling, but not much else.   We were expecting the spread of Assistant to be a big part of I/O. Google has kept the AI restricted to a select few devices since its launch at the end of last year, most notably the Pixel phone and Google Home smart speaker, but an iPhone app wasn't expected to be in the cards. The move could give Google another chance to familiarize its customers with the AI as the company grapples with Amazon and Apple to take the top spot in the smart assistant category, which extends beyond phones into smart speakers and home systems, too.  The report also claims Assistant will be integrated into GE home appliances to make household chores even smarter, à la LG's Alexa-connected refrigerators. Google didn't immediately respond to our requests for comment about the report, but we won't have to wait long to find out if it holds any real weight: Google I/O kicks off Wednesday in Mountain View.  WATCH: Someone rigged Amazon Echo and Google Home to talk to each other and it's hilarious Topics: Alexa, Apps and Software, google assistant, Google I/O, iPhone, Mobile, siri, Tech About Us Jobs Advertise Subscribe Privacy Terms Mashable is a global, multi-platform media and entertainment company.

RSS ALL ARTICLES FEATURES ONLY Search How to Add Google, Exchange, Facebook, and Other Accounts to macOS By Justin Pot on May 16th, 2017 In the past, if you wanted to add your Gmail to macOS Mail and your Google Calendar to macOS Calendar, you’d enter your Google credentials separately into both applications. It didn’t make sense: it’s the same account, so why do you need to sign in separately? Apple fixed that a few years ago by adding Internet Accounts to the System Preferences panel. There, you can log into several of your online accounts, giving the operating system and Apple-provided applications access to them. Log into your Google account once, and then decide if Mail, Calendar and Contacts will sync up with that account. You can even add Messenger, and then chat with your Hangouts friends in the macOS IM application. RELATED ARTICLE How to Customize the Share Menu on macOS And this goes well beyond Google: Microsoft Exchange, Yahoo, and AOL are supported for email, contacts, and calendars, as well. You even can add social networks for real-time notifications and integration with the macOS share menu. How to Add New Accounts To add an account, head to System Preferences > Internet Accounts. In the Internet Accounts panel, your current accounts are listed on the left, and a list of compatible accounts you can add show up on the right. Scroll through the list, find what you want to add, and then click it. You will be asked to log in. RELATED ARTICLE What Is Two-Factor Authentication, and Why Do I Need It? This works just like it does in your browser—and two-factor authentication is fully supported—so you shouldn’t have any trouble logging in. Once you’re logged in, you can choose which services will and will not sync to your Mac. For Google, macOS supports syncing of Mail, Contacts, Calendars, Messages, and Notes. Just choose whichever services you want. When you’ve got syncing working for an app, just pop it open and see how it works. Below, for example, are my How-To Geek Calendars showing up in Calendar. Most of the time, the syncing process is pretty much instant. Sometimes—depending on what you’re syncing and how much data is there—it can take a while, so be patient if you don’t see everything right away. The Different Kinds of Accounts You Can Add You might be wondering: what services are offered, and what are they compatible with? Here’s a complete list: RELATED ARTICLE How to Sync Contacts, Reminders, and More with iCloud iCloud: Enables iCloud Drive and the rest of the iCloud service, which syncs Contacts, Reminders, and more. Exchange: Syncs email, calendar and contacts. Google: Syncs email, contacts, calendars, and notes. Also use Hangouts in Messages. Twitter: Gets real-time notifications, and adds Twitter to the Share Menu. Facebook: Gets real-time notifications, and adds Facebook to the Share Menu. LinkedIn: Gets real-time notifications, and adds LinkedIn to the Share Menu Yahoo: Syncs email, calendar, and contacts. Aol: Syncs email, calendar and contacts. Adds chat with AIM users in Messages. Vimeo: Adds Vimeo to the Share Menu. Flickr: Add Flicker to the Share Menu. At the bottom of this list, you also will find the option to “Add Other Account.” If you use a provider not listed above, you can still add things like email or calendar accounts, provided they’re based on a compatible standard. Here’s a list of the standards supported by Internet Accounts” Mail: Supports IMAP and POP accounts. Messages: Logs into any AIM or Jabber account. CalDAV: Uses the open format for sharing calendars, used by many providers. CardDAV: Uses the open format for sharing contacts, used by many providers. LDAP: Supports the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol, which is used on many company intranets. macOS Server: Supports a macOS Server, so this is where you log in to sync everything up. Most of these standards are related to email, calendar, and contacts. Compatibility with open formats makes it possible for the Mac to connect to basically any service that uses those standards.

The Pinocchio paradox is an example of the liar paradox in philosophy and logic, arising when Pinocchio says “my nose grows now” as his nose can only grow when he is lying. So if the statement is true, his nose is not growing, but if he is lying, then it is growing which makes the statement, paradoxically, true.

How to build an SEO strategy to dominate your market Want to build an SEO strategy that can withstand algorithm updates, growing competitors and industry fluctuations? Columnist Jeremy Knauff explains how to do this by rethinking your approach. Jeremy Knauff on May 15, 2017 at 12:23 pm More Do you want an SEO strategy that goes beyond incremental growth? One that is defensible by being inherently more difficult for your competitors to replicate? And one that sets you apart from your competitors? Then you’re in the right place, because that’s exactly what we’re going to outline here today. First and foremost, you need to understand the difference between a strategy and a tactic. Don’t feel bad if you’re unsure of the difference, because I frequently hear smart people use both words interchangeably despite the fact that they have completely different meanings. Here’s an easy way to remember: a strategy is a plan to achieve a specific competitive advantage, while a tactic is a method used to achieve it. If that’s still a little confusing, let’s use Google as an example. Their strategy was to become synonymous with search in order to dominate the market, and today, it’s clearly evident that they’ve been successful. Some of the tactics they used to achieve that included: developing a more effective link-based algorithm that, at the time, was less susceptible to manipulation than simple algorithms based on content alone. funding their growth via AdWords, which simultaneously put their brand in front of more eyeballs and got more people (especially website owners) involved with their products. releasing Gmail as a free service to compete with Microsoft’s Hotmail, which put their brand in front of more eyeballs and got more people involved with their products. acquiring Urchin and renaming it Google Analytics, which gave them significantly more data points to refine their algorithm. It also put their brand in front of more eyeballs (website owners again) and got more people involved with their products. Are you seeing a pattern here yet? Every major business decision (tactic) made by Google played a direct role in achieving their goal (strategy). As a result, it’s been years since any other search engine has even put a dent in Google’s market share of search. Now that we’re clear on the difference between a strategy and a tactic, we’re going to explore three strategies you can use to dominate your market, along with the tactics necessary to do so. 1. Banish conventional thinking on keyword research and content development It’s easy to think, “I sell widgets, so I want to rank for ‘widgets.'” But it’s also lazy to stop there. Sure, if you sell widgets, you absolutely should work to rank for the term “widgets,” as well as variations of the term, such as: [color] + widgets [brand] + widgets [size] + widgets But no matter how many variations you include, you’ll only scratch the surface of potential topics to drive organic search traffic. That’s why it’s essential to go beyond conventional thinking and identity a greater number of lucrative, relevant topics — many of which will deliver organic traffic faster, with less effort, than the obvious keywords that everyone else is competing for Here are a few unconventional tactics to diversify your keyword research and content development. Ancillary products and/or services Do customers use your widgets as a part of another machine? Do they need a specific tool to install or use them? Do your widgets require other products, such as lubrication or calibration devices, to function property? If you answered “yes” to any of those questions, you’ve just multiplied potential topics exponentially! Writing about the products and/or services that support or are highly relevant to your own opens a whole new realm of keyword phrases. To be more clear, the concept of “keyword phrases is dead,” as I explained in a recent article on the role of artificial intelligence in SEO, so perhaps a better word would be “topics.” Think of it as buckets of topically themed words. There are a few hidden benefits of producing content on ancillary products and services: These other companies aren’t in competition with you, so they will be more likely to share and link to your content — especially since it helps promote them. You will attract visitors at an earlier stage in the buying process. Providing more information across a broader range of topics within your niche will help you appear more knowledgeable and authoritative. Let’s use the SEO industry as an example. In this case, ancillary products and services for which you could produce content will mostly be marketing-related. These products/services might include: domains web hosting premium WordPress themes and plugins website backup services email marketing services CRM software productivity tools CDN services printing social media tools podcasting services and equipment call tracking reputation management analytics conversion optimization web design Interview industry leaders Unless you’ve spent the last few decades working as a contract assassin for the CIA, you’re probably excited about having your name mentioned in the media. That’s true whether it’s Forbes, The Huffington Post, or even a tiny industry publication, and that feeling almost never goes away. You can use this to your advantage by interviewing industry leaders, which gives you a way to produce amazing content, and the best part is that your interviewees produce most of it for you! It also makes you appear more trustworthy and authoritative in the eyes of your audience, because they begin to associate you with the leaders in your industry. An added benefit is that you actually will rise to their level faster, but the benefits don’t stop there, because it can also help you reach a new, larger audience because the interviewee will share and/or link to their own interview. And this tactic gives you a way to add value from the beginning of the relationship, which separates you from the majority of people who contact them asking for something. You don’t need to be Oprah to effectively interview the leaders in your industry. Here are a few things you can ask them about to get the ball rolling: Their background, education and work experience How and why they chose to do what they do (The why is especially important) Books they’ve written or recommend Their mentors, heroes or role models Podcasts they host or recommend Events they speak at or attend as guests Publications they contribute to Products or services they recommend From a technical perspective, I recommend recording the call so that you don’t have to worry about keeping up as you type or write. Just let the software do the work, then hire a transcriber on Fiverr to type it for you. This helps you to be efficient and respectful of the interviewee’s time. Review competing products/services It may sound crazy, but writing content about your and their products and/or services can create tremendous opportunities for you, as long as yours are superior in some way. In fact, this tactic was the foundation for one of my most successful SEO campaigns early in my career. It’s important not to bash your competitors, because that will just make it look like you’re trying to overcompensate. Instead, clearly and objectively explain the differences, highlighting the pros and cons of each choice, allowing visitors to make an educated decision based on the facts. When using this tactic, you’ll need to produce two levels of content and build both internal and external links to that content. What I’ve found to work well is creating a parent page that provides a general comparison of your products/services to those of your competitors, followed by child pages comparing each feature individually. Each of these child pages should contain an internal link to the parent page, as well as to the other child pages where relevant. I wrote a blog post on how to set up WordPress permalinks that explains this exact structure in detail, so you can use that as a step-by-step guide. Consider how customers will search Thanks to familiarity with technology, proliferation of mobile devices and the growth of artificial intelligence, the structure of searches has changed dramatically. Today, instead of opening Google and entering the search phrase “home builders,” a searcher may literally ask Google, either through their Android device or Google Home, “Which home builder in Tampa builds modern-style homes between $400,000 and $600,000?” This offers tremendous value, both for searchers and for business owners. Put yourself in the shoes of the searcher for a minute — do you really want to go through several pages of blue links to find a handful of home builders who provide what you’re looking for?  Now put yourself in the shoes of the home builder — do you want to answer inquiries from a bunch of people who are looking for a different style of house than you build? When you produce content, do so with the understanding that searchers are using longer, more complex queries and search engines are using artificial intelligence to analyze the content on your page, along with dozens, hundreds, or even thousands of additional data points to provide the single answer most likely to satisfy the searcher. To accomplish this, you need to get out of your own head and into the heads of your customers. Find out what questions they have. What words do they use when talking about your industry, products or services? How well do they understand industry terminology? Go beyond the keywords themselves and get down to the thought process that would bring someone to your website. For example, while an HVAC company would certainly want to rank for the term “air conditioning repair,” especially since we’re approaching summertime here in Florida, a query that would bring a potential customer to them earlier in the buying process might be something like, “why does my ac smell weird.” When a searcher finds out that the smell is caused by stagnant water and they’re already on the website of the HVAC company that answered their question, who do you think they will call first? 2. Build your industry’s hub This is going to take a lot of time and effort, because it requires you to build an entirely new website and fill it with loads of outstanding content in order to become a hub for your industry. When it’s executed successfully, you’ll have the opportunity to hold multiple positions in the search results, you’ll have a powerful and relevant website to link to your primary website from, and you’ll have an independent platform to further improve your own authority, expertise and trust. It’s important to mention that you must be extremely careful when linking from one website you own to another website you own, otherwise you risk being flagged for manipulative linking practices, potentially damaging both URLs. In order for this strategy to be successful, the new website needs to become the absolute authority on your industry. The idea here is that while continuing to improve your primary website, you will simultaneously build a second website that will contain information and resources like: industry news industry specific business advice laws that pertain to your industry interviews with industry leaders forms, templates and other documents resources and tools trade publications (web, print and audio) trade organizations and networking groups industry events Basically, you want visitors to be able to find anything related to your industry here. In order to maximize this strategy, you need to give visitors a reason to return frequently and to send other people there. A members’ directory is a great way to do that, and a social network is an even better way. Imagine if you could create your industry’s version of LinkedIn or Facebook, so that visitors can friend their industry contacts and receive updated on their activity — how powerful would that advantage be over your competitors? While you will have to produce a tremendous amount of unique content for this website, you can recycle at least some of the research conducted for content on your primary website, but I would recommend assigning different writers for each website to reduce similarities. 3. Become an influencer I know, you’re probably thinking it’s easier said than done, right? But you can do it if you’re willing to put in the hard work that most others won’t, and it’s well worth the effort, because once you’re a recognized leader in your industry — especially within your target market, you won’t have to work nearly as hard to earn exposure and links. In fact, when done well, you can actually get your target market to help promote you and your company. I’ll share a perfect example. I’ve been in the digital marketing industry for 18 years, so I’m well known here, but I’ve recently started focusing on providing our digital marketing services to businesses in the construction industry, where initially, no one knew me. I set out to change that, and as a result of my efforts, I was asked to become a contributor for two large construction publications and was recently quoted at length in The Huffington Post about how military veterans are helping to solve the construction industry’s hiring challenges. I was even able to get that reporter to include several influential people I knew from the construction industry in that article, which created tremendous exposure for them in a top-tier publication. I didn’t ask them for anything. I didn’t say, “If you do this for me, I’ll do that for you.” I simply encouraged the reporter to include them because their opinions on the topic were relevant and valuable. It improved the story for the publication’s audience. But here’s what happened as a result — I immediately became more valuable to those people, and they immediately shared the article with their contacts. (Remember we talked earlier about how everyone loves positive media attention?) Now, instead of me telling people in my target market how great I am, the people they already know and look up to are doing it for me. Here’s the counterintuitive part — I didn’t even talk much about my company or what we do in the article. And that particular article only scratches the surface, because in addition to being quoted regularly by business publications like Forbes, The Huffington Post and Fortune, I now have the opportunity to regularly demonstrate my expertise to my target market through their own trade publications. You simply can’t buy that kind of trust. So, how do you become an influencer? I’ve been at this for a long time, however, when I reach out to someone I don’t yet know, the process is still exactly the same as it is for someone who is starting from scratch. The key is to add value early and often. In other words, never do this: It’s all about building relationships and adding value long before ever asking for anything. I personally know a lot of the people you would consider “famous” in our industry. They know they can ask me for help any time they need it, and often, when I hear they’ve run into a problem, I offer to help. It’s not a “do this for me and I’ll do that for you” thing, it’s more a matter of liking the people in my industry who I work with often. And they would do (and have done) the same for me. I’ve known some of these people for over a decade before ever asking for a favor, and I’ve known some longer but have never asked for anything. That even applies to a lot of people who are technically my competitors. Last year I was interviewed on Webcology, and between me and the two hosts, Dave Davies and Jim Hedger, there were three different digital marketing agencies on the show. Within an industry, people talk, so if you become known as a genuine person who always seeks to add value, you tend to get a lot farther a lot faster. Plus, it’s the right thing to do, and it makes you feel good anyway. Now let’s get down to the details… The first step is to create a list of the influencers you admire and respect — don’t just look at the size of their audience. Select influencers who are relevant to your target market and who share views similar to yours. Next, follow them — but not in a creepy way. Subscribe to their blog and email newsletter. Follow them on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and other social networks. If you want to be thorough, you can even set up a Google News Alert for both their name and company name. Then start engaging with them. If they share a piece of content you think your audience would find valuable, share it. Encourage your audience to follow them. Ask them questions and answer theirs. Be the first to post a worthwhile comment on their blog posts (not “Nice post!” or any other such nonsense). Link to their posts from your own. I think you get the idea. Once you’ve established a relationship with the influencers on your list, you can build a new list and start this process all over, but continue nurturing the old relationships, too. It’s important to remember not to look at the influencers on your list like a goal to be checked off. While you do want them to engage with you and share your content, if that is your only goal, don’t waste their time or your own. People will realize you’re using them, and that will will hurt both your personal and company brand.

Siri might not be too happy about her new roommate. Image: brittany herbert/mashable By Brett Williams2017-05-16 11:25:40 -0700 Move over, Siri: your iPhone might soon welcome another AI assistant into the iOS fold.  Google could throw the smartphone world for a loop at this week's I/O developers conference and unveil new Google Assistant functionality for the iPhone, according to Bloomberg. The report, which cites "a person familiar with the matter," claims the Assistant-to-iOS news could be announced as early as the first day of the event.    Assistant will come to the iPhone in the form of a free iOS app, the source said, and will depend on voice commands to work with other Google apps installed on users' phones. You'll presumably be able to ask Assistant to queue up videos on YouTube or even read off emails from Inbox, to name a few potential uses.  SEE ALSO: Google's Assistant is headed to a lot more hardware Amazon's Alexa is already available on the iPhone, although much of its functionality is restricted to Amazon's shopping app. You can also use the standalone Alexa app to control Echo devices and messaging and calling, but not much else.   We were expecting the spread of Assistant to be a big part of I/O. Google has kept the AI restricted to a select few devices since its launch at the end of last year, most notably the Pixel phone and Google Home smart speaker, but an iPhone app wasn't expected to be in the cards. The move could give Google another chance to familiarize its customers with the AI as the company grapples with Amazon and Apple to take the top spot in the smart assistant category, which extends beyond phones into smart speakers and home systems, too.  The report also claims Assistant will be integrated into GE home appliances to make household chores even smarter, à la LG's Alexa-connected refrigerators. Google didn't immediately respond to our requests for comment about the report, but we won't have to wait long to find out if it holds any real weight: Google I/O kicks off Wednesday in Mountain View.  WATCH: Someone rigged Amazon Echo and Google Home to talk to each other and it's hilarious Topics: Alexa, Apps and Software, google assistant, Google I/O, iPhone, Mobile, siri, Tech About Us Jobs Advertise Subscribe Privacy Terms Mashable is a global, multi-platform media and entertainment company.

By Matt Hamblen Senior Editor, Computerworld | May 16, 2017 11:14 AM PT Credit: Thinkstock More like this Get to know the Premier 100 Class of 2017 Microsoft launches a slew of IoT-related offerings Microgrids: Energy independence (and money saved) for companies Video Smart Cities: Barcelona Google today unveiled a cloud platform service to help organizations collect vital data from billions of Internet of Things devices. The service, Google Cloud IoT Core, is designed to help enterprises, including utilities and transportation agencies, securely connect globally distributed devices to the Google Cloud Platform. There, the data can be centrally managed and integrated with Google's data analytics services, said Indranil Chakraborty, cloud product manager at Google. One customer who has been testing the new service for two months is Energyworx, a company of 40 workers that has used Google cloud services since 2014. Energyworx provides data analytics to utilities to help them plan better and improve performance. The new Cloud IoT Core has been deployed by Energyworx to get real-time data readings from thousands of solar inverters and electric vehicle charging ports that have been deployed in California and other locales, said Edwin Poot, founder and visionary for Energyworx, in an interview. He said he expects to expand the test of Cloud IoT Core to include collection of data from millions of smart utiity meters used to measure water and gas in coming years. Cloud IoT Core provides a communications bridge between Google analytics and devices in the field, Poot said. Many of the devices, including solar invertors, rely on distinct or arcane data protocols that Google services can translate without manual intervention. (A solar inverter converts the variable direct current of a solar panel into a utility frequency alternating current that can be fed into the commercial electric grid.) With the service, utilities can send control commands to meters, turning them on off, he said. Energyworx only pays Google for the IoT devices it uses to receive data, Poot said, which should keep costs low. Overall, Poot said Google cloud services have cost a 10th what Energyworx was paying to Amazon Web Services, which it used prior to 2014. "We're seeing the power of cloud will grow fast and this [Google IoT] approach will be scalable," Poot said. "We don't install anything and don't maintain anything. We just program it and use it and don't worry about anything else."

Google's 'Trusted Voice' feature keeps turning off for some users Phil Oakley Follow View All Posts 2017/01/08 11:18am PDTJan 8, 2017 38 Plus 1 on G+ 60 Share on Facebook 94 Share on Twitter Total Shares192 Applications Google News The OK Google command is great, but I think we'd all agree that it can be a little... temperamental at times. Our Glorious Leader Artem recently took to Google+ to air his grievances about Trusted Voice, the feature that recognizes your voice and unlocks your phone accordingly. What happens when Trusted Voice is off. Specifically, Artem was complaining about Trusted Voice automatically, and seemingly randomly, turning itself off. This is annoying because it means when asking Google Assistant, or Voice Search on non-Pixel phones, the phone has to be manually unlocked before it answers.   Left: as you can see, Trusted Voice is off. Right: the Trusted Voice setup phase. This may be a bug limited to the Google app v6.10 beta, but I've found it happens with versions prior to that on my Nexus 6P. I'll set Trusted Voice up, and it'll work as intended for a little while - say a month - but then one day I'll ask it to play some music or set a timer and it'll say 'I can't do that as your phone needs to be unlocked' or something similar. Rinse and repeat. If Google wants to be the leader in the voice assistant market, it's crucial Assistant works as intended. This means improving the reliability of the OK Google command and ensuring it works 100% of the time. We'd be interested to hear your comments on this, and see if it's related to specific phones or versions of the Google app. Let us know in the comments!

Randomly works at times and other times it simply doesn't. mbarna I've been experiencing this bug on a Nexus 5x throughout the summer of 2016. Haven't seen it crop up recently though. Gonzales It happens on my 5X as well. I was chalking it up to Action Launcher 3 but it still happens with no launcher active. Very frustrating Van_Hammersly Same here. Nexus 5X. Although it happened on Nexus 5 and previous phones as well. Always took a reinstall. Artem Russakovskii Your GIF at least shows the voice prompt and then the lock. With Assistant, you just see the lock, and the voice prompt only shows up after you unlock, which... well, is just as frustrating. Chris Ledbetter Mine on my pixel will show a message saying i have to unlock the device and the prompt is no longer up forcing me to do it all over again. SMH Not a big deal, just something that should be flawless from a search giant... The Fink it happens on Samsung phones as well. Arie Yup, this is happening to me for quite a while.. Nexus 6P, on 7.1.1 blassster This has happened to me before as well, most recently after applying this month's security patch. Anthony McCann Well, on the plus side, at least the voice command was for a good cause Ailín Ó’S This has always happened to me, it's never worked. I have my phone in Irish/Gaeilge and Google in English (Ireland). Goyam Jain This issue has been with me on the Galaxy Su Edge running Android Marshmallow since when I bought it in November. It sucks when it happens JPJ My XL works sporadically and I'm using the Jan update. John Doe Trusted Voice isn't even available on the Nexus 6. I believe it used to be there but I don't know what happened. JasonIvers Did anyone ever find out why the Nexus 6 doesn't have that option? I never did see a reason, just that it was the case. It generally doesn't affect me, as I have trusted devices most places I would actually consider using it. Noeltorious Used to be there, and if you toggled it on it would toggle itself back off. Must've been really broken for them to disable and then remove it digitalcircuit I've had a similar issue where "Say 'Ok Google' any time" keeps turning off a split second after I enable it. Checking logcat points to "AlwaysOnHotword start recognition failed with error 14" and "sound_trigger stdev_load_sound_model failed." Upgrading/downgrading Google Search doesn't help. Frustratingly enough, this was working fine for a month or two on CM 13.. then broke. Then worked again when upgrading to CM 14.1.. then broke a month later. Nexus 6. Logan Snyder I have a 5X, I haven't noticed trusted voice turning off randomly, but I've noticed the "Ok Google command" has a lower and lower recognition rate until it becomes abysmal and almost never recognizes the command. I have to retrain the voice mondel like once a month. chinna_rao I've been having this problem with my device for quite some time but then, it just blew up when I repeatedly tried "OK Google" ing it...Samsung Note 7 matteventu "it'll work as intended for a little while - say a month" You are lucky then. With Pixel XL it happens that you setup the "Ok Google" always on and as trusted voice, and after HOURS it stops responding, forgetting the "vocal-training" you made. And there's no a toggle for this, you have to reinitiate every fu**ing time the vocal setup. Ernie Mine is fine sproc Well at least your fingerprint reader still exists, lol. Some of these issues are like Win9x era crap. ehTuBrutus Happens to me Everytime I switch between user accounts. Gives me a pop-up saying it has been turned off so I took it to be by design. I take it others have it happening even when not switching accounts? I wonder if Artemis has more than one user açcount on his phone? Andrew Palmer I used it to skip a track the other day. I didn't like the next track either so tried to do OK Google again. No response. Joe Mihalich I experienced this twice on the first day I received my pre-ordered Pixel XL. After i retrained it the second time, it hasn't happened again. Lucky me. Now if they would just fix the stupid freeze/lockup issue i can get on with my life. Brian Demodulated Trusted Voice is always turned on for me but often when I give a voice command I'm prompted to unlock my phone before the command is executed. So annoying. whispy_snippet Yep, I experience all of the above on my Pixel. Sucky. shamatuu yep nexus 6P. been turned off on its own for couple of months and yet Google seems to not care to fix it. really hope they fix it ASAP because they not what they used to be. blakeleeper Its happening on my Pixel XL v6.10.33.21 Kwetsima Maluleke Its been doing this to me for ages. About a year maybe. David Hyman Me too but it has been working a lot better for me for a while now Sharondhart Google is paying 97$ per hour!

Les Deplorables Yep...ages here too! Annoying. Michael Gerberich I have a similar issue with Trusted places. It works for a while and then just stops working. S7 Edge. vwnut13 Didn't OK Google used to work with a locked screen? Jimas Happens on my Nexus 6P Google v6.10.33.21. It started happening maybe a week or two ago, but it resets almost like every 2-3 days. Zaptor99 On my Note 4, I don't have Trusted Voices, I have "Personal Results". I turned it on. But If I go to Maps, Settings, Navigation, Ok Google, then the same screen from google app appears, but instead of "Personal Results", I see "Trusted Voice" and it's turned off and it then automatically turns off "Personal Results" in google app. Very confusing. Grey Are we reporting bugs on AP now? Because there are tons of bugs to report, especially with Google Now. It doesn't make sound anymore for one. If your phone is in landscape mode and you get it to turn on, it will turn on then stop because it's in landscape mode and you have to repeat it. Not to mention it does not respond every time. And try saying "remind me tonight dentist appointment at 11 am", cause what it will give you is a reminder for "tonight dentist appointment" due at 11 am. It's got issues. We gonna call them on all of it and try and get some pressure on Google to fix stuff? You gotta do it AP, we can't. Ibrahim Yusuf It happend for me on my nexus 5x on marshmallow, even updating to nougat didn't fix it. But I fixed it by deleting the voice model and retraining again. I got an answer on reddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/AndroidQuestions/comments/5bgngq/cant_activate_always_on_ok_google_voice_detection/ Amir This is not new. I've been having this issue since the beginning of 2015 on my Nexus 6, 6P and now on Pixel XL. Ive completely given up on that feature. opticalgenesis Same here :( - also bonus points for Muse Himesh Kulkarni Same problem here but works less than a month, maybe like a few days. Also, I don't get any reply, it's just blank (doesn't work). Peter Me: "OK Google" Pixel: "Bleep" Me: "Read last message" Pixel: "You have one last message, would you like to hear it?" Me: "Yes" Pixel: "OK, cool, cool." ... Me: "WTF?" Andre Only once this has happened on my Nexus 5X. I have not experienced this issue in a while. jack_k1 I absolutely loath saying"OK Google". It just doesn't roll off the tongue. I feel like I'm gargling. demarcmj Even if it did "roll off the tongue," four syllables is just way too much. Fatty Bunter Google Home accepts "Hey google" too, which is much better. Hopefully they'll add this to phones too. Cory S Hey Google has a much lower activation rate than Okay Google for me, which is a shame because I hate that hot phrase. jack_k1 Try using Trusted Face when you have a long flowing beard. Hah! nxtiak YES!!! My Pixel XL suffers this issue, so f'ing annoying, I thought I was going crazy! JimOnTheBeach Yes happens on my new LG V20.i thought I was doing something wrong. Shawna Bartron This has never worked for me. LG Stylo 2 Travis James I don't have this issue, but I will keep yelling at my phone when driving "OK Google" with no response. When I have a chance to pick up my phone and unlock, I see that it can't reach Google, even though I have connectivity. Super annoying. Brandon Buchanan I use this feature all the time, but never have trouble with it on my Nexus 5x. King_Android Expect bugs with Beta. Uninstall beta clear data enable using default Google now launcher and all is well. catalysto For as long as I've had my 6P, I've had a similar problem. After a week or so, saying "OK Google" with the screen off stops working. If I toggle the settings off and back on, it works again for a while. But then usually by the time I actually need it, it has stopped working again. I gave up on it and just use the microphone button now for voice commands. Van_Hammersly It's done this to me on at least three separate phones over the past few years. Random and annoying. Each time I think when I get a new phone it'll stop doing it, foolishly. Parneet Singh It always does after few days on my nexus 5 X. Ok google stops responding to voice commands dmo580 That's not the same as Trusted Voice turning off. You're talking about OK Google detection just failing. The screenshots here specifically show the toggle being turned off. Let's not mix up two issues. Yvonne Campbell I have this issue as well, where both the 'trusted voice' and 'detection from any screen' toggles get turned off. gtoninn I have had the same thing happen to me. In addition to that the most recent update to the Google app has left my manually requested google searches with voice (IE I hit the voice search button), getting stuck and then the Google App has to be restarted. Also on a 6P Pyrazol You mention this now? It's been doing that to me for AGES. I thought switching from the Moto X to the Nexus 6 would ease my woes, but nooo. I just don't use that shit anymore because it's so freaking unreliable. dmo580 You don't even have trusted voice on the Nexus 6 as an option in the Google App. Keep in mind this issue is a very specific one regarding trusted voice. Moto's own implementation of always on listening is different as they pay for the license themselves. Cypress Frankenfeld Has anyone logged an issue on the Android bug tracker? I'd gladly star it. Joe Mine's always done this, it just randomly stops working. I always thought it was just because of updates causing it to shut down and needing to be reactivated. sea_hawk I have the same issue for a month. after I joined the 7.1.1 beta and then left the beta, but still experiencing the issue. sea_hawk Never mind... just tried enabling it, and it finally let me do that... not sure what happened. But in the past when I tried enabling trusted voice, it would ask me to input my pattern, but after I do that, the button stays "off"... sorry, not of much help HotRodJohnson Welcome to the world of the Nexus 6 users. The forum for this feature says, Hey Nexus 6 user, you can forget about it! Noeltorious I actually have a similar issue on the Pixel XL. I'll say OK Google and it will wake the screen up and show me the lock screen. Subsequent OK Google's or swiping to launch from the lock screen just point me to use my fingerprint to login. Once I use the fp-sensor the screen unlocks with Assistant launched. Weird and annoying, haven't figured out steps to reproduce because it's so random I don't think it's toggling off though because I never have to toggle anything on to fix it. RecalcitrantOne Just commenting to echo what others have said, happens to me and my 5x. Wouldn't mind being able to set my own "hot phrase." Either way, the emphasis is wrong with "Okay Google." The emphasis is on the second syllable of okay, but first for Google so it's not smooth. Rob I also noticed it deactivated many times, making it unreliable (Nexus 6P 7.1.1). It's been deactivating since the summer but it's a few weeks it hasn't anymore. I hope this gets addressed. Ashlynn This happens for me. Google Pixel version 7.1.1 - Google version 6.10.36.21amd 64. This recently started happening for me. Had no issues a few weeks ago. Chris Tashjian Same here!! It's been resetting on me daily for the last couple weeks jaxjoe Same issue with my PixelXL - was working up until 2-3 weeks ago. Now it doesn't stay turned on for more than a few hours at a time Luke Taylor Ohhhhhh yeah. It'd happened to me only 4 or 5 times on my 6P in the last year, but suddenly in the past two weeks it's happened to me about 6 times- which is how I found this article just now. Come on, Google! stephen Galaxy s7. turns off in middle of voice searches and even while I'm typing in a search. Annoying to have to start typing all over again! Version 6.0.1 Niels Buekers I get this on my Pixel XL since a week or 2.. nikov I've had it happen a few times in the past on my Nexus 6P, but it has become very common in the last month or two. I'm running in to real issues with it at this point. bryguy76 I have a Pixel XL, worked fine for the first month, and then started turning off all the time. It's so annoying. Miguel Dey My pixel just started doing this.. any fix for it yet? Random! LG G3 D855, stock fw. Started happening to me a few days ago. Now this feature freaks out every couple days. Russ We have two Pixels and both do this. It's infuriating. It'll work flawlessly some days and then sometimes we'll say "OK, Google" and just get the lock screen and then go into the settings and find Trusted Voice has turned itself off arbitrarily. Trueblue711 It must be a bug with Google Play services. I'm one of the very few people with a Nexus 6p still running Android 6.0 and this bug happens to me all the time. Ronny Keller Disabling "Battery Optimization" for the item "ok Google enrollment" seems to do the trick for some users. Aaron Kelly I hope this does the trick. I'm trying it. It makes sense. Joe Mihalich This is still happening to me with google app 6.10.37.21. Kris Tyler This is happening at least monthly on my Samsung Galaxy S5. Then it makes me retrain it and opt in. EVERY FREAKING TIME. So annoying, especially when it won't dial numbers when I'm driving. It's enough to make me consider an Apple. Al It happens on Pixel too. I'm starting to wonder if it's anytime the phone restarts. SSt Me too. Nexus 6p Laksamana Just happened to me since last week (Galaxy S6 on Android 6.0.1). Kept asking me to opt back in into Trusted Voice. Andrew Slater I have a 6p on version 7.1.1 and it had been doing this for a month or 2. But instead of it turning off a couple months apart, it turns off after only a couple days. Very annoying. JC Pixel XL, Android 7.1.2, Google App version 6.12.19.21.arm64. Does this multiple times a day, multiple times a week. So annoying it's driving me crazy. Been this this since my Nexus 6P a year ago Austin Ingram So annoying. It stays on for maybe a day or two then it's off again. Austin Ingram It may be related to training it in noisy environments - if you do that then try to activate it when it's quiet it may not recognize your voice and disable it for "security". Ankit Sud It's happening frequently with my Pixel as well. Defeats the biggest use case for Assistant in my opinion. Kyle Bailey Still happening with my Pixel. Is there any fix? bluescrubbie Just spent a while on chat with Google support. They say they've fixed the issue and we'll be rolling it out in an update soon. Patrick Ledwith Really? That's a relief. Wulf Nesthead 786 I'm sure it was indeed a relief; since, however, that was months ago and they have yet to fix it, are you still relieved? Garth Hedley I have Nexus 6P and 7.1.1. so fault is not restricted to earlier Android versions. I've set up TV numerous times. Each time after phone locks, Google app voice says can't do that phone is locked. Tatyana Tatyana I turn it on and the same day the "Trusted Voice" option will turn itself off. Drives me fucking bananas. PeterDTown Infuriating! It seems that every time I try to use this feature it's turned off again. Katie Conforti Seems if you don't use your phone for 4 hours the setting gets disabled. So annoying, makes assistant nearly worthless. https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/6093922?hl=en Aaron Kelly My 6p has been doing this for about the last month or two. Every 3-7 days it happens. It's frustrating. I use the Trusted Voice to dial all the time, so when it doesn't work because of something like this, it makes me mad. Shannon Doak It is happening with my Pixel as well. stsin 6P on fi started doing it after I went off the beta os test due to severe battery issues. Dušan Todorović "trusted voice" my ***. After setting it for who knows how many times, yesterday, when i wanted it to start Clash of clans, that annoying answer pulled my nerve with "actually i cant do that while the device is locked, please, unlock blablabla.." for the last time. I disabled it. Guys doing the Ok Google "magic", clearly this is happening for a while and to many people, independant of android version, root opt, device, launcher, gapps version, google+ version, etc. Either fix the darn thing or stop pretending to be Siri's competitor. This sucks big time. Simon Jude I have this exact problem! I'm on an LG K7, anyone actually know how to fix this? Paul Kopalek My Nexus 6P turns the 'Anywhere' feature off INSTANTLY when I turn it on. Even when wiping Google app data, clean flashing the 7.1.1 ROM all over again, and disabling Battery Optimization for 'OK Google Enrollment. This is infuriating. Dave Segal HTC One M8 and galaxy 7 Yvonne Campbell Yes!! It's not just my trusted voice that gets turned off but my detection from any screen. Suddenly I can't just say "ok google" and get a response without touching my phone. Rather defeats the purpose. I have a Samsung Galaxy Note 5. Another issue I'm having, but think it would be a phone issue, is that I have answer calls with voice commands turned on, and even though it stays turned on, it does not work anymore. PP Saini I have the opposite issue. The "any time" option will not stay off. I toggle it off, but am immediately able to say OK Google with my phone responding. Check the setting, and it is oddly back on. Kristina Starck Constantly on my Note 5. It also pops up a window asking me what I just said everytime I listen to anything with my headphones plugged in. Even disabling the assistant altogether doesnt stop the spam. Callahan Jason Droid Maxx 2 - used to turn off randomly, more recently I can not keep it on. If I switch it on back out to previous screen then go back-it will be off Salazryl Ismail I have this issue too on my SGS3 and HTC One M8 Jean-Sebastien Penney Same here about once a week Nexus 6p Stapin Does this on an LG KV8 as well. Restarting the phone works, sometimes I have to since the assistant fails to respond even after the phone is manually unlocked Elijah Francis Pixel XL: Voice search keeps shutting off for me shortly after using it. Also the search bar won't even begin to load search results either.... REALLY annoying when you're driving and want search somewhere with a simple voice command. After this bug shows up seemingly immediately I'm forced to restart the phone only for it to happen AGAIN. Google fix this shit. Annduhroo It's started doing this on my Pixel... Not okay at all. Wulf Nesthead 786 I have marshmallow on a droid turbo and I can't get trusted voice to work for me for as much as a single day. Google released a "workaround" which literally does nothing to fix the problem. I don't know whether they are malicious and derive glee from their lies, or are just stupid. Ordinarily one would think that if one releases a workaround, it would actually, well, work.

gizmodo Deadspin Fusion Gizmodo Jalopnik Jezebel Kotaku Lifehacker The Root gizmodo The Complete Guide to Dumping Google David NieldYesterday 2:04pm Filed to: Google delete your account desktop mobile online 52 5 Edit Promote Share to Kinja Toggle Conversation tools Go to permalink Had enough of Google meddling in your affairs? Rather impressed by what Microsoft is doing with Outlook on the web? A little bit spooked by how much data Mountain View has on you? Whatever your reasons for splitting up with Google, here’s how to make sure it’s a clean and uncomplicated break. Get your data out Google Takeout is simple and easy to use. Image: Screenshot To give Google some credit, it makes it easy to get your data out. The service you’re after is called Google Takeout. Follow that link, and you’ll be asked to sign in with your Google credentials, and then to pick the services you want to download data from. Advertisement Almost all things Google are listed here, from your videos in YouTube to your browsing history in Chrome. The tool allows you to retrieve data even from lesser-known Google services, such as Google Groups and Google Fit. The only exception that we could spot is Google Play Music. Download your MP3s separately using the desktop Music Manager. You get an email when your download is ready. Image: Screenshot Once you’ve chosen the archive format and delivery method, click Create archive. Google will send you an email when the archive is ready to download (if you’ve chosen to download it), and you can then unpack the files on your computer at your leisure. Advertisement Archive formats might take a little tinkering to be readable on the other end. Gmail messages, for example, are saved in the .mbox format, which can be imported into Thunderbird, Apple Mail, and various other clients. If the client or service you’re switching to doesn’t support .mbox files, use POP to download all your Gmail messages instead. Enable it in Gmail settings, then follow Google’s instructions to set up your email app of choice. In another example, YouTube videos, reappear in the format you uploaded them in, together with an HTML file holding the attached comments. Bookmarks from Chrome are exported in an HTML file too, so you can easily open them up and store them in whatever web browser you decide to switch to. Make sure to double-check  your archives before actually getting rid of your Google account, just to make sure all the important stuff is successfully exported and saved. Chrome OS users, do you know where your files are? Image: Screenshot If you’re a heavy Google Drive user you can deploy the desktop client to sync everything to your Windows or macOS computer as an alternative to using Takeout, though, the advantage of using Google’s official export service is that it will convert all your Docs, Sheets, and Slides on the web to other formats (like Word documents or PDFs). Advertisement Sponsored Should there be a Chromebook somewhere in you mix of gadgets, don’t forget to have a look at the local download folder on the actual laptop to make sure there are no files there that you can’t live without. Once your Google account is gone, you’re going to get booted from all Google services that need a login, including Chrome OS. Remember to take good care of your data while it’s being transferred somewhere new—you don’t want your entire digital existence to get wiped if your laptop gets stolen or lost while you’re switching from Google services to the alternatives. Delete your Google account So long, Google. Image: Screenshot Google’s reach spans many, many services and apps, but fortunately for us, deleting your account can sever ties with all of them in one quick blow. Start at your Google account page, click Delete your account or services, then choose Delete Google Account and Data. (Some services, like Gmail and YouTube, can be erased separately if you want to keep your main account.). From there, you’ll be presented with a review of all the data that’s going to go. After checking some tick boxes to check to acknowledge that you are of sound mind and really do want to delete your account, you can click Delete Account to wipe everything Google holds on you. Google has more on the process here. Note that you’ll lose everything you’ve ever bought from Google Play, from apps to movies, and you’ll also lose your Gmail username, which you can’t use again. Google says you’ve got 2-3 weeks to change your mind if you want to recover your account, and you’ll be asked to answer some security questions to verify your identity before Google finally pulls the plug. Find some alternatives DuckDuckGo searches the web but doesn’t track you. Image: Screenshot Once you’ve successfully extricated yourself and your data from Google’s clutches, your next step is finding new tools for your all your email, search, and photo storage needs. There’s more choice out there than you might think. For search, where Google makes its money, the obvious big-name alternative is Bing from Microsoft, but the ultra-clean, ultra-private DuckDuckGo is absolutely worth a look as well. If you’re no longer going to use Gmail, then you can switch Microsoft’s Outlook, Apple’s iCloud, or even Yahoo Mail. Advertisement Advertisement Apple’s email option is ad-free, and of course, simple to use if you’re going to switch to the iPhone as your mobile phone of choice—and iPhone life is pretty much unavoidable if you want to cut the Google cord. While you can use an Android phone without a Google account, you won’t be able to download any new apps until you sign in, which limits your options somewhat. Firefox is a good choice if you’re ditching Chrome. Image: Screenshot As for desktop apps, ditching Google Chrome is easy enough: Firefox and Opera are excellent alternatives, and even Apple Safari and Microsoft Edge have their upsides. For your mapping needs you can switch to products from Apple or Microsoft, or give the consistently impressive Here Maps a go. Advertisement Your photos and videos will of course be very important to you, and we’ve previously written a full guide to switching from Google Photos to Apple Photos. If you’re not running into the open arms of Apple for your photo management needs, Flickr is still worth considering, and Microsoft’s OneDrive will do the basics as well. Apple and Microsoft have online productivity apps you can switch to. Image: Screenshot Microsoft can also help you out if you’re heavily invested in Google’s online office suite: Basic versions of Excel, PowerPoint, and Word are available online, as are Apple’s productivity programs. Of the independent services, Zoho is probably the best option, though it’s focused on businesses rather than on individuals. While we can’t give you detailed step-by-step guides for getting your ex-Google data into all these products, in most cases, it’s pretty straightforward, and you should now have a good idea where to start in each area.

Name: Subject: Message: Verizon pulls its version of the LG Watch Sport, cancels recent orders Newsby John Callaham12 hours ago 17 111 4 In February, Verizon Wireless, along with AT&T and Google, started selling the LG Watch Sport. Along with the LG Watch Style, it was the first such device to have Google’s Android Wear 2.0 OS running out of the box. Now, Verizon has confirmed that it is no longer selling the LG Watch Sport, and has also cancelled recent orders for the smartwatch from customers. See also: Best Android Wear watches 1 week ago Droid Life first reported on this change by Verizon, and adds that people who had their LG Watch Sport orders cancelled are being offered $100 off other smartwatches sold by the carrier. AT&T is still selling its version of the LG Watch Sport for $349.99 or for $249.99 with a two-year contract. The Google Store has it listed as well, but you can’t buy it from that outlet; it puts you on a waitlist instead. Verizon has not revealed a reason for its decision to end sales of the LG Watch Sport, but it apparently happened right around the same time it started selling its own Android Wear 2.0 smartwatch, the Verizon Wear24. This would seem to suggest that Verizon would rather have its customers purchase its own branded smartwatch over LG’s device. Whatever the reason, this move by Verizon to end sales of the wearable, just three months after it went on sale, has to be considered a setback for both LG and Google. The companies co-designed and developed the LG Watch Sport so it could help Google launch Android Wear 2.0. Now that watch is now no longer available from one of the US’s biggest wireless carriers, and will certainly affect overall sales of the wearable.

Asked about his emotions on the occasion of his final home game as a Manchester City player, he has lots to say for himself. “When I first came to Manchester City, I never thought I’d be here this long,” he admits in his best Manchester accent. “It’s been a wonderful nine years but in life you have to make tough decisions for yourself and your family and I think now is probably the time for me to leave.” On the subject of his final 30 minutes of action at the Etihad: “It was so tough to play that half an hour,” he says. “There were so many emotional moments and all the good memories were coming to my mind. I’m so proud of all I’ve done for this club on and off the pitch.

TECHNOLOGY Here's What to Look for in Google's Biggest Event of the Year Google's I/O conference is around the corner. By Steve Kovach Business Insider WRITE A COMMENT CREDIT: Getty Images Advertisement Get ready for Google's AI show. Google I/O, the company's annual developers conference and biggest event of the year, is usually an Android event where we get a look at the latest features for the smartphone operating system. But when I/O kicks off this Wednesday, expect Google's latest artificial intelligence efforts to be what everyone ends up talking about. If you've been paying attention over the last year or so, you've noticed that Google seems especially passionate about AI, injecting it into everything from search results to chat apps to the new Google Assistant for Android phones and the Google Home speaker. CEO Sundar Pichai has sounded especially bullish on the prospects for AI on recent company earnings calls and public interviews. That was just the beginning. Internally, Google sees AI as its next major platform after search and Android -- and it wants to give developers a way to get in early. Here's a quick preview of what to expect from Google during the opening keynote at I/O. The event kicks off Wednesday at 10 a.m. Pacific. Building for AI The Google Home speaker.Hollis Johnson/Business Insider At last year's I/O, we got our first look at Google Assistant in the Allo messaging app and Google Home speaker. Now that Assistant has had time to mature and grow into other devices like the new Galaxy S8, expect Google to talk about how developers can build for the platform. This is very similar to the third-party "skills" that are part of Amazon Alexa that let you do everything from play games to order a pizza from Domino's. Google's ambition is to build an entire platform based on AI and voice control, and Wednesday's speech will be all about getting developers excited about the prospect. Google is also expected to announce that its Assistant will be coming to the iPhone and other third-party appliances like GE home appliances, Bloomberg reported Tuesday. The stakes are pretty big. Amazon already has a big head start with Alexa, and the digital assistant is already showing up in a bunch of third-party devices like thermostats and even cars. It also has thousands of third-party skills. Microsoft is also working on expanding its Cortana assistant, and announced connected speakers from Harman Kardon and HP coming later this year. But to borrow Pichai's favorite phrase, it's still "early days" for the category, and everyone is still trying to figure out the best way to grow their respective AI platforms and eventually turn them into real businesses. For Amazon, it's a bit easier since Alexa encourages you to buy more stuff from the company's massive online store. Google and the others will have to figure out how to stuff ads into screenless devices in a non-intrusive way. Expect to see a clearer look at that vision during the keynote. Android Antonio Villas-Boas/Business Insider Don't think Google forgot about Android though. Although the company gave an early look at the next version (called Android O for now), it mostly focused on developer-friendly features. We'll probably get a better looking at the user-facing features Wednesday. Android O will likely debut this fall with the sequel to Google's Pixel phone. We might also see an update on Google's mission to let Chromebooks run Android apps, turning them into full PCs. But the early models of these Chromebooks are littered with bugs, and develops haven't modified their apps for a laptop-sized screen yet. There's still a lot of work to be done. Cars No, we're not talking self-driving cars, but cars running Android for their infotainment systems and other controls. On Monday, Google announced that Audi and Volvo will make cars that run on Android so you can run apps like Maps and Google Play Music without plugging your phone into car like you have to do with Android Auto or Apple's CarPlay. It also features Google Assistant so you can ask the car for directions or give commands while driving. Finally, it can control basic functions like the air conditioning and seat positioning. Expect to see some demos at I/O this week. Virtual reality and augmented reality A Daydream VR headset.Hollis Johnson/Business Insider Google's VR platform Daydream debuted at last year's I/O, and has since launched on the Google Pixel and a few other devices. The company also bought VR gaming studio Owlchemy Labs, a sign that it wants to start building more VR content in house. Expect an update on how Daydream is going. Other stuff Since Google I/O is a developers conference, there will be a lot of wonky developer talk on top of all the flashy consumer stuff. We won't bore you with that. You can also expect some updates on Google's chat apps Allo and Duo, Instant Apps (which let you "stream" a snippet of an app when you click a related link in search), and maybe a demo from one of Google's sister companies like Nest or Verily. Flops Google has a long history of announcing stuff at I/O that either fail or the company never follows through on. Google TV. Google Glass. The Nexus Q. The list goes on and on. If you see something from Google on Wednesday that looks too good to be true, it just might be. This post originally appeared on Business Insider. Published on: May 16, 2017 Advertisement

Google Maps v9.53 brings back a setting for transit notifications and prepares for better-informed commutes [APK Teardown + Download] Cody Toombs Follow View All Posts 2017/05/15 6:06pm PDTMay 15, 2017 18 Plus 1 on G+ 47 Share on Facebook 47 Share on Twitter Total Shares112 APK Teardown Applications Downloads News Article Contents 1 What's New 1.1 Return of mass transit station notifications 2 Teardown 2.1 Traffic notifications for your commute 2.2 Set your method of travel for commutes 3 Download An update to Google Maps began rolling out over the weekend and this one appears to be focused on keeping people in the know on their commutes. This version brings back a toggle to control notifications about delays and interruptions at mass transit stations, and this time it might be here to stay. A teardown also shows we'll soon have traffic notifications for the commute between home and work and that more modes of travel will be respected besides just driving and mass transit. What's New Unofficial Changelog: (the stuff we found) Toggle for mass transit station information notifications (again?) Return of mass transit station notifications Users of Google Maps may recall a toggle was added to v9.49 a couple of months ago that gave users a choice about receiving notifications regarding mass transit stations. This was based on work that first appeared in a teardown last year in June, but there had been some changes in the meantime. Perhaps this happened earlier than intended and was was removed shortly afterward. It's back with v9.53 and could be here to stay. On the surface, nothing special has changed from the last time the toggle was added, and there have been similar settings even before that, but some new text seen through a teardown does suggest this implementation is a little more likely to be final. Along with the basic notification title and summary, there are also a few lines that go with the notifications. code <string name="TRANSIT_STATION_NOTIFICATION_SETTINGS_TITLE">Station information</string> <string name="TRANSIT_STATION_NOTIFICATION_SETTINGS_SUMMARY">Get departures and disruptions for nearby stations</string> <string name="TRANSIT_STATION_GENERIC_TERM">Transit Station</string> <string name="TRANSIT_STATION_MORE_DEPARTURES_AND_INFO">More departures and alerts</string> <string name="TRANSIT_STATION_NO_UPCOMING_DEPARTURES">No departures within the next hour</string> <string name="TRANSIT_STATION_WITH_PLATFORM">from Platform %s · %s</string> <string name="TRANSIT_STATION_NEXT_DEPARTURE">Next: %s</string> <receiver android:name="com.google.android.apps.gmm.transit.TransitStationBroadcastReceiver" android:exported="false"> <intent-filter> <action android:name="android.intent.action.BOOT_COMPLETED" /> <action android:name="android.intent.action.MY_PACKAGE_REPLACED" /> </intent-filter> </receiver> <receiver android:name="com.google.android.apps.gmm.transit.TransitStationService" android:exported="false" /> <service android:name="com.google.android.apps.gmm.transit.TransitDepartureBoardFetcherService" android:exported="true" android:permission="com.google.android.gms.permission.BIND_NETWORK_TASK_SERVICE"> <intent-filter> <action android:name="com.google.android.gms.gcm.ACTION_TASK_READY" /> </intent-filter> </service> Where things get a little more detailed is a new prompt that allows users to block notifications for stations that they don't need. In the previous teardown, individual lines – say for busses and subways – could be ignored, but this focuses on the stations, which often have their own distinct issues. <string name="TRANSIT_PER_STATION_BAN_NOTIFICATION_TITLE">Turn off notifications at this station?</string> <string name="TRANSIT_PER_STATION_BAN_NOTIFICATION_TEXT">%s</string> The most telling reason to think this feature is sticking around this time is the text from a pair of new notifications that ask users if they've visited a station and if the transit notifications are helpful to the user. The first is obviously there to gauge accuracy, but the second clearly shows the Maps team is seeking to judge the efficacy of these notifications. In the end, this may determine if they are successful or have to be adjusted. code <string name="TRANSIT_STATION_LOCATION_ACCURACY_NOTIFICATION_TITLE">Were you at this station?</string> <string name="TRANSIT_STATION_LOCATION_ACCURACY_NOTIFICATION_TEXT">%s</string> <string name="TRANSIT_STATION_LOCATION_ACCURACY_NOTIFICATION_RESPONSE_NO">No</string> <string name="TRANSIT_STATION_LOCATION_ACCURACY_NOTIFICATION_RESPONSE_YES">Yes</string> <string name="TRANSIT_STATION_USER_SATISFACTION_NOTIFICATION_TITLE">Are these notifications helpful?</string> <string name="TRANSIT_STATION_USER_SATISFACTION_NOTIFICATION_TEXT">Public transport departures and delays.</string> <string name="TRANSIT_STATION_USER_SATISFACTION_NOTIFICATION_RESPONSE_HELPFUL">Helpful</string> <string name="TRANSIT_STATION_USER_SATISFACTION_NOTIFICATION_RESPONSE_NOT_HELPFUL">Not Helpful</string> There are already some mass transit notifications in both Google Maps and the Google Now stream (or whatever it's being called these days), but this adds another nuance and might save some people from getting stuck somewhere because a station is effectively out of order. I don't live near any mass transit and triggering these notifications generally isn't possible if you're not jumping on a bus or train fairly often, so I'm not sure if these notifications are already operational with this update or if they're still in limbo until further notice. If anybody has started receiving them, let us know in the comments below. Teardown Disclaimer: Teardowns are based on evidence found inside of apks (Android's application package) and are necessarily speculative and usually based on incomplete information. It's possible that the guesses made here are totally and completely wrong. Even when predictions are correct, there is always a chance that plans could change or may be canceled entirely. Much like rumors, nothing is certain until it's officially announced and released. The features discussed below are probably not live yet, or may only be live for a small percentage of users. Unless stated otherwise, don't expect to see these features if you install the apk. Traffic notifications for your commute The Google app has been offering tips about commuting between home and work for a long time, perhaps going back to the initial launch of Google Now in 2012. Now in 2017, it looks like Google Maps is preparing to launch a similar feature of its own. The text taken from the apk is pretty straightforward, noting simply that it's a notification with real-time traffic conditions between your current location and either home or work. It actually sounds a lot like the real-time traffic information we already get, but in the form of a notification. code <string name="TRAFFIC_TO_PLACE_NOTIFICATION_SETTINGS_TITLE">Travel times</string> <string name="TRAFFIC_TO_PLACE_NOTIFICATION_SETTINGS_SUMMARY">See ETAs to home and work</string> <string name="TRAFFIC_TO_PLACE_NOTIFICATION_PROMO_TITLE">Beat the traffic on your commute</string> <string name="TRAFFIC_TO_PLACE_NOTIFICATION_PROMO_CONTENT">Get notifications about real-time traffic conditions, based on your current location</string> <string name="TRAFFIC_TO_PLACE_NOTIFICATION_PROMO_ACCEPT">Turn on</string> <string name="TRAFFIC_TO_PLACE_NOTIFICATION_PROMO_DECLINE">No thanks</string> <receiver android:name="com.google.android.apps.gmm.traffic.notification.service.DismissTrafficToPlaceNotificationReceiver"> <intent-filter> <action android:name="com.google.android.apps.gmm.traffic.notification.service.DismissTrafficToPlaceNotificationReceiver.NOTIFICATION_DISMISSED" /> </intent-filter> </receiver> <receiver android:name="com.google.android.apps.gmm.traffic.notification.service.TrafficToPlaceNotificationGeofenceReceiver"> <intent-filter> <action android:name="com.google.android.apps.gmm.traffic.notification.service.TrafficToPlaceNotificationGeofenceReceiver.ACTION_DISMISS" /> <action android:name="com.google.android.apps.gmm.traffic.notification.service.TrafficToPlaceNotificationGeofenceReceiver.ACTION_UPDATE" /> </intent-filter> </receiver> Why is this being added to Maps when the Google app already does it? I would assume it's there so all of these types of things can be managed in a single place. I doubt it will mean the commute care will be removed from Google Now. While this does create a redundancy between the two apps, it has the notable advantage of giving users some choice about how they would like to receive this information and in which form. Set your method of travel for commutes Google Maps has been very good about supporting different modes of travel for a long time. Google's Navigation feature is pretty great at giving directions whether you're walking, driving, cycling, or hopping onto mass transit. However, when it comes to commuting, it seems like there may have been some assumptions that everybody either drives or uses public transit. It looks like the Maps app wants to give users a little more control over that by allowing users to choose a mode of travel for their commutes. <string name="COMMUTE_CATEGORY_TITLE">Commute</string> <string name="COMMUTE_BASIC_TRAVEL_MODE_SETTINGS_TITLE">Mode of transport</string> <string name="COMMUTE_BASIC_TRAVEL_MODE_BIKING">Cycling</string> <string name="COMMUTE_BASIC_TRAVEL_MODE_DRIVING">Driving</string> <string name="COMMUTE_BASIC_TRAVEL_MODE_TRANSIT">Public transport</string> <string name="COMMUTE_BASIC_TRAVEL_MODE_WALKING">Walking</string> There's not enough information to go on to determine where this setting will show up or what it will be used for precisely. I also can't be sure if this is a single setting that's expected to be the majority of a user's commute or if it will relate to each leg of the trip (e.g. people that drive 20 minutes to a train, then ride for another 20 into a city). Still, there is more attention being paid to these other methods, which means more useful information for those that can use it.

SSyar No location sharing option yet !! Jumanji! Location sharing is definitely present in Google Maps (I can see it on my device), though it may not be present in the version you have.

Oh google ddevito I just hope the traffic notifications are still embedded within the Google app itself (launcher) and doesn't get separated into Maps exclusively.

Netflix confirms it is blocking rooted/unlocked devices, app itself is still working (for now) Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/05/13 3:08pm PDTMay 13, 2017 234 Plus 1 on G+ 1125 Share on Facebook 427 Share on Twitter Total Shares1786 Applications News Earlier today, Netflix started showing up as 'incompatible' on the Play Store for rooted and unlocked Android devices. However, the app itself continued to work fine, leading some (including myself) to think it could have been an accident. However, Netflix has now confirmed to us that blocking modified devices from downloading the app was intentional. This is the full statement: With our latest 5.0 release, we now fully rely on the Widevine DRM provided by Google; therefore, many devices that are not Google-certified or have been altered will no longer work with our latest app and those users will no longer see the Netflix app in the Play Store. If you're not familiar with it, Widevine is a Google-made DRM technology that works across various desktop and mobile platforms. Widevine categorizes devices into three security levels, ranging from all processes running in the Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) to not running anything in TEE at all. However, the Play Store listing seems tied to a device's SaftetyNet status (which is used by Android Pay), rather than the Widevine TEE. For example, Artem's bootloader-unlocked stock Pixel is still on Widevine Level 1, the most secure level, but fails SafetyNet because it is unlocked. The update's changelog also confirms the: "Version 5.0 only works with devices that are certified by Google and meet all Android requirements." What isn't exactly clear is why only the Play store listing is blocked, but the app itself continued to function normally. I tried both Netflix 4.16 and 5.0.4 (the latest version, from today), and both worked without problems on my unlocked and rooted Galaxy Tab S (which is labeled as Widevine Security Level 3). Maybe at some point the app will stop working, but that does not appear to be the case right now. If you have a blocked device, I recommend following the Pushbullet channel for Netflix on APKMirror (click the Pushbullet button on that page) so you can continue to receive updates outside the Play Store.

First the vpn's now this... why oh why??? Jimk4003 Surely because licensing is regionally specific, and because rooting has the potential to defeat DRM. I get that it might be annoying for some people, but aren't the reasons obvious? David Juarez But root?? Lol Semianonymous Probably an effort to reduce Region spoofing? Idk how easy that is to do on a stock device. Jimk4003 Because rooting has the potential to defeat DRM. mjh49783ab DRM doesn't work. All DRM does is inconvenience the end user. Jimk4003 Possibly. But Netflix have to negotiate licencing deals with the movie studios, and having DRM helps reassure the studios that the movies they have spent millions of dollars making aren't going to get stolen off Netflix without any attempt to stop it. mjh49783ab One could make the argument that rooting the phone may compromise the DRM. But blocking users from unlocking their phones to switch carriers? That is total bullshit, and is just the sort of thing that encourages users to pirate the content. Jimk4003 Netflix are blocking you from switching carriers? lomsha Sim unlocked phones are fine, unlocked bootloaders are blocked. mjh49783ab They didn't exactly make that clear in the article when I last read it. h4rr4r The studios need to reconsider blu rays then. Way easier to rip. Nothing they do will stop piracy. This kind of thing actually encourages it. Jimk4003 Maybe studios do need to consider Blu-ray's. That isn't Netflix's problem though. h4rr4r No Netflix problem is making sure they don't let the studios reduce the value of their product. If Amazon video works on my devices and Netflix does not that is a big deal to me. In that case I might as well sign up for more addon channels on Amazon with the mkney that currently goes to Netflix. Jimk4003 Agreed. But the studios are responsible for making the product they redistribute. It's certainly a balancing act, and I can see both sides of the argument, but Netflix isn't an inalienable right, and those who don't meet the T&C's are going to miss out. h4rr4r Sure, but the studios and Netflix are going to create pirates with these kind of actions. People aren't going to miss out. They will just pirate what they can't get legally. Jimk4003 Sure, but again, it's a tiny fraction of users. If Netflix can negotiate better terms with studios by blocking rooted devices, and thus improve their business overall at the expense of a few fringe users, it stands to reason that is what Netflix will do. Doby Gillis whaa fucking whaa. Sergio Carmona The only obvious thing here is your sarcasm detector not working properly. Go have it fixed please. Jimk4003 Nah, I'm good. h4rr4r So the reason are to make the product worse for the consumer. Great idea, now piracy looks better and better. Jimk4003 What percentage of phones are rooted though? Most people won't care, or even notice the change. h4rr4r It does not matter, if it drives even one person to piracy that is a loss. Jimk4003 But if they can ensure better licensing deals via these new terms, which will attract more customers at the expense of a few rooted users who make up a tiny fraction of overall users; will Netflix care about that loss? h4rr4r But if it encourages piracy the other side of the contract should want to avoid it. Gaining customers in the short term like this hurts the whole market in the long term. Cyber_Akuma Because yeah, people are going to rip movies from Netflix and not off a Blu-Ray.... and even IF they were to attempt to rip them off Netflix, they would use a PHONE and not a PC.... Jimk4003 Ripping Blu-rays isn't Netflix's problem, and Netflix don't need to try and guess what device someone would try and commit piracy with, when the technology exists to restrict them all. Cyber_Akuma You are missing the point, people aren't going to be ripping from Netflix over ripping from a Blu-Ray, and on top of that, they sure as hell aren't going to be ripping off a phone. And actually, you are wrong, the technology to "resist them all" does NOT actually exist. There is no one technology that "restricts them all" but several different technologies for different platforms with various levels of viability and success. Jimk4003 I said 'the technology exists'. When did I say it was a single piece of technology? Let's not be those guys who get in a pedantic argument about semantics on the internet. Regarding the issue under discussion; Netflix's job is to make their platform as robust as possible against piracy, using whatever technology is available to them. Blu-Ray simply isn't their problem. Cyber_Akuma Because just arguing "technology exists" is worthless, plenty of technology exists, and plenty of it is misused. Technically the technology to remotely brick your phone exists too, doesn't mean it's fine to use just because it "exists". And no, their platform already is robust, you are trying to ignore the fact that people ripping movies off a phone is a complete and total non-issue just to try to argue for Netflix's sake, this is ESPECIALLY considering the fact that it harms far more legitimate people than it helps. Sorry, but no, just a plain and completely undesputable NO. You can't argue that it's ok to use something that will hurt a large majority of people just to potentially possibly stop an extreme minority of people who would not even use this method anyway. That's like arguing it's ok to burn down a house to kill a spider. Jimk4003 "You can't argue that it's ok to use something that will hurt a large majority of people". We're talking about Netflix blocking rooted users; in what reality do they constitute the 'large majority' of Android users? Cyber_Akuma I meant the majority of the rooted users. Last time I checked, over 25% of people with an Android device had root access, which is several million users. And OF those several million rooted users, how many do you think actually use their rooted phone and Netflix app to pirate content? Less than 1% Hell, less than 0.1%? They are hurting over 99% of rooted Android users, which while not the majority of Android users is still a lot, to attempt to stop (and not even that effectively as there have been work-around for SafetyNet checks for nearly a year now) an extreme minority OF a minority from doing something they are unlikely to do due to other methods anyway. Richard Markert >I meant the majority of the rooted users. Even the majority of rooted users is a drop in the ocean when it comes to Android users worldwide. Cyber_Akuma Again, over 25%. You also completely missed the point of the argument in that this hurts nearly all rooted users that would not use this maliciously. Lord Argyris Looks like I'll have to start updating manually then. Or just not bother with the app at all since I rarely use Netflix on my phone as it is. SpasilliumNexus Thank goodness the 3T's Open Beta of OxygenOS is good enough for me to not unlock my device and stick with complete stock. Now I wonder why I haven't received any Netflix app updates beyond 4.16.1 build 15145 on the Play Store, when APKMirror has 4 newer versions. ast00 They asked for it. Now pirate their content knowing that you tried doing it the legal way, but THEY declined. Φώτης Because unlocking your Android powered device is such a "bad" thing to do. Whatever Netflix.

EowynCarter Yeah me too. And unless they change this, bye netflix account. No point in something I can't use anymore. Demoncat The funny part about video DRM is it's easily defeated. It's more convenient to steal the videos than to deal with the DRM restrictions. Fedup Exactly. Between VPN'ed torrents and nzbs, my Sonarr downloads all TV shows (netflix, HBO, ABC/CBS/NBC/FOX) automatically within minutes of them being ripped and posted by others. It is 100% automated, and with my Plex server running, I can watch shows anywhere - cost = $0.00. I don't do this to save money. I do it for the convenience, lack of ads, and freedom of time/place shifting. Heck, some shows actually download BEFORE they air on network TV (i.e. Designated Survivor). stan dex 97 new dark web premium links . also included are netfix lifetime membership links as well as graphic Live chat links (use anonymously) https://satoshibox.com/axbr7vnm6ifzk8hwtcreoe28/buy d0x360 I cancelled​ my account, sent them feedback and then just asked a friend who I let use HBO go and a Chromecast ultra if I could use their Netflix. David Gabel That seems rather dumb. Why cancel your service to them yet still use it via someone else? You're not teaching them anything. For an example, let's say you have a MacBook, and Apple does something to piss you off. You sell your MacBook, but then borrow a friend's MacBook. Nothing was actually accomplished. d0x360 Nothing was accomplished? I cancelled my account and let them know why. Now they aren't making money off me but I still to use their service. Your analogy is deeply flawed...deeply. So deeply I don't think you understand exactly what an analogy is. David Gabel So, you're "not giving them money" yet you still support them by using their product. It still seems like your logic is flawed. If you're really that pissed at Netflix, don't use it. Period. Use a different service instead of supporting them by borrowing it off a friend, as they are also giving them money (and support) , too via their subscription. revbones How is using their service for free "supporting" them? They aren't getting any revenue off you if you're not paying them. Saying you're supporting them by not paying them is a little stupid don't you think? xyz lol. So by your "logic" a person who pirates House of Cards is also supporting Netflix ? BobButtons You're doing the opposite of supporting. You're getting the benefits of their service while stopping payment and adding to server load which they pay for. David Gabel So far, your stance is the only one that makes sense. The rest so far are noise Sir Doogie Houser M.D.Esq. 200 You seen like an incredulous douch who I'd suplex onto a park bench for being a lap dog bitch.How is canceling or stealing not doing something.Also,its not a fucking macbook jerkoff its a paid service for TV on a phone they expect to be paid for.BTFO David Gabel And you are a loud mouth keyboard warrior that loves to talk a big game, but in reality have little to no control over anything and use web forums to spout obscenities and violent threats to make yourself feel better. nagi Just another step that makes pirating the same content more convenient... we should really be going the other way if they ever want piracy to be reduced. lomsha Funny thing is their content is available to stream all over the internet. Don't see how this move fights piracy as long as computers have access. This just alienates legit users who are doing nothing nefarious on unlocked/rooted devices. Richard Branches By one everybody pays... Pathum Addarapathirana Dude I root my phone to just get iPhone emojis and to tether without my carrier knowing. Like I'm not stealing anything this will just make me stop paying for Netflix. Latheryin Just a heads up. Those treating hiding mods are fake. There is no way to hide if from the carrier. Heck if they wanted to they could see every web page you load from a ton of different places and ways. Yan Minari That’s why god invented VPN Latheryin Yes but even then it doesn't block everything. qqqqqq My provider absolutely blocks tethering - I've been using various methods, including VPNs, to block it for literally YEARS... Hasn't been difficult. Dylan Harris That's not true. All you have to due to bypass tethering limits on t-mobile is to change the TTL on the tethered device. Latheryin That just gets by the automated checks. Get a live person to randomly pick your account (not really likely but happens) and it is not had to tell if someone is tethering. Dmitri Smirnov All that person will be able to tell is whether customer is using a lot of data or not. And this is the root of the problem: be honest that you are limited traffic, instead of trying to play this game of "we'll pretent we are giving you unlimited data and in return you'll only use small-format mobile device, so that we'll hope that you won't be able to use as much of it". Kind of "all you can eat, but you have to only use a tea cup and one chopstick". Latheryin No the issue is people being entitled and taking advantage of things. You have people running their gaming systems and using hundreds of gb a month. Not only is that kinda dumb but it violate the fair use act in most cell TOS. If people didn't abuse the system then it wouldn't be an issue. Also just some food for thought. If they can't tell anything more then a lot of data just how do they route the traffic properly? Make no mistake. If the carrier wanted to they could tell. I know for a fact that there is a team for both att and Verizon that is tasked with just that. Dmitri Smirnov >No the issue is people being entitled and taking advantage of things. You have people running their gaming systems and using hundreds of gb a month. "taking advantage" I thought that people were in their right by using what they paid for. Allright, tell me this - is it allright for me to watch 4K video on my phone (since the screens allow it now)? What's the difference between this and me watching the same stream on my laptop over my phone's connection? What if I just redirect the video stream to my TV using WiDi or any other technology? How is browsing a site from a laptop different from browsing it from a phone network-congestion-wise? And then it boils down to the same argument - carriers are just hoping you'll use the network less from you phone device, as it's less convenient. The more convenient smartphones become for consuming large volumes of traffic, the sooner carriers will have to more away from this scan and expose the actual numbers. > If people didn't abuse the system then it wouldn't be an issue. If carriers would be honest and upfront about "hidden" caps, then people would not be able to game the system. > Also just some food for thought. If they can't tell anything more then a lot of data just how do they route the traffic properly? Make no mistake. If the carrier wanted to they could tell. Latheryin Tethering was never even an extra charge until people started taking advantage of the mobile networks. Watching 4k videos is not a big deal, using 200gb of mobile data in a cycle is flat out stupid. Mobile networks were not designed for that type of traffic from a single device. Nor was it made to handle running your ps4 while you are gaming. Why do you think that pages are made to be mobile friendly? Not only is it a usability issue but a data usage issue as well. It's not hidden. All people have to do is read the TOS. It's all right there. Yet most people just don't want to take the time to do it and then get made about it. Can't blame the carriers for that. Dmitri Smirnov > Watching 4k videos is not a big deal, using 200gb of mobile data in a cycle is flat out stupid. a) I'm glad we're finally on the same page that the real problem for networks is data usage and not tethering or no tethering. b) You are aware that you're contradicting yourself in the same sensense? 4K 60Fps video bitrate is ~20-40 MiB/s which gives an average movie the size of about 72GiB. so by your definition watching a movie in good quality is OK as long as you don't watch more than 3 of them in a month. c) how is using mobile data that you paid for - stupid? If there are caps - announce them and make it impossible to go over them instead of shaming people who actually decide to take you up on your offer. d) tethering has not been an extra charge until telcos understood that they could charge extra for it (just like them toying with idea of charging extra for Instant Messenger traffic, because it undercuts their SMS plans). > It's not hidden. All people have to do is read the TOS. It's all right there. Yet most people just don't want to take the time to do it and then get made about it. Can't blame the carriers for that. Well, carriers are the ones calling their plans "unlimited" and hiding the actual caps either buried deep in the ToS or behind the vague "reasonable usage". So don't blame people for not wanting to wade through pages of legalspeak just to learn that you lied and "unlmited" is just "50Gb and then throttled". Fedup Agreed. The problem is the AMOUNT of data consumed by a given user account - no how it is consumed. If carriers are concerned about individuals abusing their network, then they need to flag those accounts that use an excessive amount of bandwidth - whether it's through tethering or directly on the device itself. I could easily burn through 150GB/mo on my TMO Note 4 w/o tethering simply by leaving my Blue Iris app connected and streaming 24/7. So it's actually very easy to abuse the system without ever turning on the tethering. Ravonus Damitri this guy is a nut ha... I agree with you 100% bro. Ravonus um yes you can fake it... Sure you can't block the traffic... but you sure can make it seem like the traffic is coming from your phone and not being used to tether.. Which is what these apps do.. SMH lol Latheryin If that is what you wish to believe. OK. Android Developer Is the tether solution needed even if you do it using USB ? Fulbring What a stupid move. I pay for the premium for Netflix and I never thought that I might have to cancel my service just because they did this. The only reason why I have root is because of AdAway and TitaniumBackup. I still use the stock OnePlus 3T ROM. Wasn't expecting this at all.... Kinda suck. Will be interesting to see how many customers they lose. Julian Berger Not enough to change it back... 4Ui812 DRM has no place in our lives. I suspect Netflix will have a change of heart within 6 months. Branko Xiaomi phones say bye bye to Netflix. Google go fuck yourselves. Steve_Jobroni Go fucking buy a windows phone. 天地人 Seriously though Windows phones are great. The only problem with them is the lack of applications. Otherwise, it runs great on low-end hardware, has a great UI, the homescreen is innovative, synchronisation with Windows PCs is cool, etc. dukaki Don't forget that you can use the Netflix website on Edge instead of their shitty app, and it streams at full 1080p, even on my L650 with a 720p screen. 天地人 Wait the Netflix application hasn't an option to stream at FHD? dukaki Nope, just 480p like on android. The device has to be "certified" and there are no certified windows phones afaik. The WP app doesn't even have downloads yet, I think. Edit: Just checked, no option to download here but you can on the desktop app. EowynCarter Might end with a visit at the apple store in my case. Windows phone is kind of not supported anymore. Jimk4003 This is Netflix, not Google. Cyber_Akuma Google invented this SafetyNet crap, let anyone use it for any reason (Hell, Pokemon GO of all things started using it), and over the last year have been making it even more and more strict and unforgiving. So no, a HUGE part of the blame does lie on Google for being openly hostile towards rooted users and not giving a damn about them. Jimk4003 There are legitimate reasons to use Safetynet to check the integrity of a device: Android Pay (or banking apps in general) is one example. It isn't necessarily hostility to root users; it's just a reality that Google need to be able to demonstrate to banks or other third parties that their OS is secure, and that people can't bypass built in security safeguards. Netflix need to do the same with the studios they redistribute content for; and they've chosen to use Safetynet to do it. Netflix isn't a human right; you have no inalienable right to root your phone and to use Netflix. Cyber_Akuma Except that not even my own banking app uses SafetyNet, it still has root checking and certain sensitive features are disabled if I am rooted, but not the entire app. Furthermore, it IS hostility to rooted users, because anyone can toss SafetyNet into their app for any reason whatsoever (such as games using it "just because" in case of cheaters... which doesn't even help at all to stop them). Google has been completely unwilling to work out ANY sort of compromise or method that can keep a phone secure without basically tossing rooted users under the bus. Jimk4003 What sort of compromise do you envision? Cyber_Akuma I am saying that they didn't even try. PCs by default obviously allow admin accounts all the time, even as the main user account (as much as that is not recommended) yet can maintain security. Google when they were confronted with people who were hurt by SafetyNet, legitimate users mind you, basically just shrugged them off and didn't even bother considering what could be done to allow the device to remain secure while also having such safeties in place. I mean, all these apps that you can use on your phone, can also be used on a PC, many of them available in either a browser or native app format, yet it remains secure. There is no reason this could not be done with Android, especially considering it used Linux as a base, they are just refusing to even consider it. Jimk4003 Don't you already have that choice? Your phone is sold without root access (i.e. no admin rights), and you can then choose whether or not to root your device and gain elevated privileges. If you do choose to root your device, you will lose access to some Safetynet enabled applications. You can, of course, unroot if necessary. Cyber_Akuma First of all, not all phones are. Especially in non-US countries. Second, it shouldn't have to be a choice. How many PC apps refuse to run under an admin account? Practically none. I shouldn't have to choose between having root access or being able to use a apps that more and more are starting to add this nonsense to them. Third, it's not even just root, even having an unlocked BOOTLOADER now, even if your rom is 100% stock and unrooted, can trip SafetyNet, it didn't used to be that strict. It's ridiculous to claim one should be able to have one or the other, even SafetyNet could have been designed to not be this brokenly strict, but Google had no interest in doing so, and they are rapidly making having root more and more useless while we still have to deal with all the junk they force on your phone from the manufacturer... that you can only remove with root. Jimk4003 Well, it is what it is. You believe you shouldn't have to make a choice, whereas I believe life is all about making choices and living with the outcomes. We seldom get everything we want, and neither Netflix, nor rooting, are inalienable rights. Whether or not you think it should be a choice, it is one; choose what you feel is best for you. Cyber_Akuma That's not even an argument, that's just trying to claim that the status quo should remain for no reason other than it is the status quo. It shouldn't have to be a choice, and arguing that people have to choose between root and having an increasingly less amount of apps just because "it is what it is" is insanity. In fact, it wasn't even the status quo before until Google started pulling this nonsense with SafetyNet a short while ago. That doesn't mean people should just accept it. Jimk4003 It's not an argument, because there is no argument to be had. The reality of the situation is self-evident; you can't have a rooted device and install Netflix via Google Play. Accepting the status quo has nothing to do with it; it's simply acknowledging reality. You have to choose what's more important to you; Netflix or rooting your phone. Finding the reality frustrating, as you clearly do, won't make it any less real. If this was a serious discussion on human rights; censorship, migration, justice, gender equality etc., then it's important in a democracy to be aware of your rights and responsibilities, and challenge the status quo where necessary. But this isn't anything like that. This is two for-profit corporations, Google and Netflix, who provide services to which you have no fundamental right to access, nor any obligation to use. You can choose to pay for their services and accept their terms and conditions, or you can choose not to. You don't get to pick the terms and conditions of the service someone else is providing you; however you are free to not use the service if you don't like the terms and conditions under which they are provided. That's it; it's no simpler or more complicated than that. Ranting on the internet about how unfair you perceive it to be is irrelevant. Again, it is what it is. Cyber_Akuma Again, there is no "it is what it is" argument. There should be no choice, PERIOD. You are basically saying that people should not complain about this just because "it is what it is". No, it is NOT what it is, it should NOT BE what it is, and people can and WILL complain that it SHOULD NOT be what it is. You aren't even making any rational arguments anymore, just re-stating what the current situation is and then basically claiming that people should not want or expect better. Jimk4003 You can want or expect better if you like. Netflix, like every other for-profit enterprise in a capitalist system, will either succeed or fail based on its ability to turn a profit. Right now, Netflix is turning a profit, and clearly thinks it can be more profitable by excluding rooted users whose theoretical ability to circumvent DRM restrictions may impact its ability to secure rights to new content. Clearly you disagree with their stance, and the only way to see for sure if your disagreement is warranted is to watch their financial performance from here on out. None of the above changes the fact that you aren't entitled to Netflix. You've chosen to root your phone, and Netflix have recently chosen to exclude rooted users. That leaves you with a choice to make. Even if you think that choice is unfair, even if you think you should be able to have both. The reality is you can't have both, and you will have to choose. Again, Netflix isn't a right. Go elsewhere if you disagree with their business practices; that's how capitalism works. Beyond that, you're just having a spat with reality; and that's a tough fight to win ;) Cyber_Akuma Actually, what do you think would lose them more profits, the theoretical minority OF a minority that MIGHT rip movies on their phones (which still requires a Netflix account in the first place) or blocking that 25% minority? Also, drop this "right" nonsense. No, seriously, drop it right now. People are paying for a Netflix account, they DO have a right to get the service they paid for. Netflix made zero warning or mention of this impending block, they pulled it out of nowhere for paying customers. So sorry, but they DO have a right to the service, since they are paying for it. Sony was found to be legally in the wrong when they removed the OtherOS feature from the PS3, because why? Because people PAID for the console when it had that feature, they DID have a right to what they paid for. You're just having a spat with arguing for argument's sake when you don't even have an argument. Jimk4003 There is no argument; it's the reality of the situation. Netflix have implemented DRM controls that block access to the Netflix app via the Play Store on rooted devices. I do understand why Netflix want to tighten their DRM procedures, and I do understand why some people have been left frustrated by this change. The reality is, however, if you want to download the Netflix app via Google Play, you will need an un-rooted phone; such as the phones used by the majority of Android users. That's all that's happening. I get that you don't like it. But stamping your foot and shouting 'no fair, no fair' achieves nothing. Netflix are entitled to run their business how they see fit within the law; and consumers get to choose whether they want to give Netflix their business or not. That's all there is to it. Don't like the way Netflix do business; don't give Netflix your money. Cyber_Akuma All you are doing with the "it is what it is" argument is just repeating what the article is saying. That is not conductive to anything. Anyone who has read the article knows what is happening right now. And sorry, but you are doing the same stamping your foot with the "well, it is what it is" argument. Not to mention that you are also wrong, because over the last 5 or so years ALONE there have been dozens of examples of consumers speaking out against policies or DRM and the companies begin forced to reverse it from the backlash. So you are doing nothing but hurting legitimate users by trying to argue "it is what it is". And again, no, they are not entitled to run their business in a way that without warning locks customers out of what they paid for, Sony tried this... and got in legal trouble and lost. So sorry, but you are wrong, and you have been nothing but wrong this entire argument. Netflix isn't' "entitled" to do this, people DO have a reason to complain, there IS a reason to complain, complaining HAS changed such practices before, and all you are doing is further hurting legitimate users by attempting to insist the "it is what it is" non-argument. Your entire argument has been fundamentally wrong from the start. Jimk4003 It's not my argument; it's simply Netflix's position. I get you don't agree with it, but it's totally valid for Netflix to wish to strengthen their DRM procedures. You do know I'm not responsible for Netflix's decision making, right? It is what it is; I wouldn't get too upset about it. Cyber_Akuma Again, "it is what it is" is not a valid argument. Jimk4003 No it's not an argument. Again, there is no argument necessary; the reality of the situation is self-evident, and no amount of arguing here will change it. The fact is this; YOU rooted your phone. You weren't forced. You should have known that by rooting your phone you are modifying the device beyond its factory specification. You should have known that this essentially makes you responsible for the proper operation of the device; you no longer have the device manufacturer or Google to turn to when software that you have modified doesn't work as expected. You should also have known that rooting prevents a device from complying with the compatibility test suite, and that this can affect your devices ability to function correctly. You should have been aware of the SafetyNet API, and anticipated the fact that this API would be adopted more and more broadly as Google promoted its usage. You can't blame Google for this; as before, once you modify your device beyond its factory spec, you're responsible for supporting yourself. Rooting a device is at the owners risk. You've now found yourself in a situation where a modification you have made to your device prevents you from accessing a service you want to use. That's on you; no-one made you modify your device, no-one said they would take responsibility for the changes you have made to your device, and rooted users are expected to assume liability for any ramifications and complications they face as a result of their decision to modifying their device. Netflix are well within their rights to enforce DRM on their product by using the SafetyNet API provided by Google, and the Google documentation clearly states rooted devices will fail the CTS check. This documentation is publicly available. You went ahead and rooted your device anyway. That's on you. It's no-one elses job to make sense of the decisions you have taken. You're free to carry on using Netflix if you return your device to a state where the integrity of the device can be verified. Or you're free to carry on using a rooted device and living with the compromises that entails. Your choice. Cyber_Akuma I don't think you get it. All you are doing is parroting what the article is saying. Furthermore, despite there being plenty of examples of complaining doing EXACTLY what you claim it cannot do, that is to change such decisions, you keep repeating that "complaining will do nothing". You are a broken record, arguing the same "it is what it is" argument over and over so you can avoid actually thinking. An argument (and yes, no matter how much YOU stomp your feet that it is not, it IS an argument) that has already been disproven over and over and over. You also ignored that there are many countries where phones are already sold rooted, or how such things don't effect using such services on a PC with admin rights which are the same thing, or the dozens of other holes in your logic large enough to sail a ship through. There is no "you should have been aware" because this is a total lapse in common sense and my device is in no way incompatible from a hardware or software level, but rather, the app is purposely rejecting it. Furthermore, they made no prior warning whatsoever. This is like arguing "you should have known modern cars could be remotely disabled" if a dealership decides to just disable all cars with an aftermarket radio installed. I don't know where to even begin with all the broken wrong logic in that last post. Why are you even here if you couldn't care less? You are free to carry on being a living example of "First they came", but don't come crying about how nobody else is listening to you because you could not possibly be any more wrong. I DO have a right to use Netflix on my device, rooted or no, if I am paying for it. If you argue against this, you are wrong. People DO have a right to root their devices, if you argue against this, you are wrong. People DO have a right (and have many many MANY times in the past) to challenge the "it is what it is" status quo, if you argue against this, you are wrong. And I know you WILL argue against this, which will mean that, see above, you are wrong. I have been more than patient with your insane thick-headnedness. At this point I can't tell if you are being willfully ignorant or really are just that ignorant. Or just trolling, that is an option as well. There is no way anyone rational at this point can continue to argue the insanity that you have argued. Jimk4003 I interpret personal insults as an indicator that the individual making them no longer has any faith in their actual arguments, and so I think it's time to call time on this particular discussion. As you've pointed out, neither of us is getting anywhere. It's been fun, but once it starts getting abusive, the fun has to stop. It's a shame, because DRM Vs individual user rights has the potential to be a really interesting discussion topic. I hope you get what you're after; and that the reality of the situation will change to be more in line with what you think it should be. Unfortunately I imagine the situation regarding DRM and rooted devices will only get more restrictive going forward. Take care. Cyber_Akuma You purposely instigate people into losing their patience with you, and then claim "I win because you got angry", especially when the anger is because you were refusing to understand the entire argument throughout this entire mess. My1 even if you dont have any right to access netflix, the whole point of netflix and others is making it easier to use those than to do piracy but when netflix goes around branding the rooted users as pirates and blocking them, they sure arent helping their purpose. especially if netflix is (I dont have it so I didnt try) runs on VGA and DVI Screens (no HDCP) where you can just capture the stuff. I mean it's say same withz Bluray Playback on PC, in addition to needing a Bluray Drive, you need an HDCP Compliant Graphics card, bus encryption, and HDCP compliant Monitor, and not to forget You Piece of PowerDVD which you have to upgrade (aka buy again) every few years because the older versions dont get Key Updates. and then we have stuff like unskippable trailers and all the other bluntly said Bullshit when dealing with that. of course Piracy is easier, just download the file and play it on any device you want, no internet and nothing required and no problems. My1 and even if one piece of software wont run in an Admin account, with LUA even on Admin they arent having and privileges unless you kick in the UAC, and to top it, even if the app wont be running if I force it as admin, and only runs with active LUA concept, I can still run anything else as admin and screw the other software running as normal user over (cheatengine is the perfect example for this) Richard Markert Root is, by definition, unsecure. Any time you have userland processes that have access to ring0 you are inherently unsecure, as there are no restrictions placed upon running code at that point. Cyber_Akuma And yet, there are ways to run it securely on PCs. Netflix and online banking would not be available on PCs if it wasn't. My1 well but from another side, root can also be used to just patch any holes that were there. actually happened a few times before. My1 banking apps dont have a reason for a root check if they are done properly, i.e. TANs are generated with an air-gapped extra device. TANs on the phone are in general not safe and if the TAN is able to be generated offline, someone could use an exploit to root, steal the secret for TAN generation and boom, it's over. and dont even start thinking about sms-TAN, it's even worse. also when I just want to look into what my account is doing, I am not happy when I cant do so. My Bank (Hypovereinsbank) more or less recently blocked root and well I just RootCloaked that thing into oblivion and can do my stuff. but I'll probably change anyway since they sadly have no good way of TANs (just paper-based list-TANs, SMS and app) TedPhillips mostly agree. by providing a turn-key 'lockdown' check, and further by ret-conning it into playstore access (let's see how far they take that) -google is now openly hostile to anyone who bought into android for it's ability to customize and truly 'own' your own device. the open source roots of android was a big differentiator vs something like iOS, but now that they have dominate market position - they are walking away from that without concern. (only worrying about how slow they need to boil the frog to get away with it) meanwhile, what middle manager is going to say 'no' to adding safetyNet checks in their app or play store listing? it is an easy way for them to write down on potential risks, unjustified (which it pretty much always is) or not. blindexecutioner So the solution is to install from outside the play store. That's great for security. Way to go. Richard Markert No they don't. Since Windows 7, new and default users are not Admin accounts. koiulpoi Sorry, this is absolutely wrong. The first user created on a Windows PC has full administrative access, limited by UAC. You can still delete System32, it's just mildly harder than it used to be. If "new and default users" were not Admin accounts, they couldn't install software, so... Richard Markert Default user accounts are higher than Limited accounts, but not as high as Admin accounts. That's why they can install software. Linux users are not admins but can still install software, right? It started on Windows 7, expanded in 8/8.1 and now in Windows 10 a user account behaves just like a user account in Linux. It has no access to %systemdir% unless you manually go in the folder properties and give your user account Admin permissions to it. You can still run things AS admin by giving the permission at runtime, but since all that requires is pressing a button (if your built-in admin account isn't passworded, which it isn't by default, one step forward two back, sigh) and most users are too "stupid" to simply not press that button. koiulpoi It's really funny when people speak authoritatively about something they're so wrong about. The first account created by the Windows OOBE is automatically added to the Administrators group. This means they're an Administrator. They have Administrative privileges. The fact that certain actions are blocked until you click "yes" on a simple UAC prompt doesn't stop this; they're in "Admin Approval Mode", which can be disabled via GPO if you care to. If you buy a computer from Dell (example), set it up, then go to System32 and start deleting .dll files, it'll ask for administrative privileges, but you can click yes and away it goes! Some files are protected at "SYSTEM" level, which is higher than administrator, but DEFAULT USERS ARE ADMINISTRATORS. This has ABSOLUTELY nothing to do with the "password" on the built-in "Administrator" account. That account is disabled out-of-the-box. Please, you're digging a bigger hole trying to look "right". How to prove this: Set up a new computer. Set up user default for MS. Start -> Run -> netplwiz -> Be amazed that your user is part of the group "Administrators". TechGuy22 Haha kodi Doesn't matter to me I Stopped paying for Netflix long time ago. C64 Haha Teranium TV 😎 TechGuy22 I like that too. You can even get the mod one and remove the ads. Lol C64 I know, i always use those. I want to pay for the dev, but there's no option to do that. Koko time is coming with a big update to tim242 Thief. Renato Santos This is stupid. Congratulations, Netflix. Jan-Lk Else It is also getting more and more necessary to unlock / root devices due to missing updates etc. But I'm not a Netflix customer and won't become one. C64 Whahaha, this has to be the most retarded move of the year in any category (even Trump can't top this). I'm glad i don't use Old Crap Flix. A Person Hillary, then Netflix. C64 Nope sorry. Since Trump is your president i can't take America serious anymore A Person Timeout, you're not even a US citizen? No interest in your opinion. James F Wow. Just wow. I can't take you seriously either if that's how you treat people. Not cool, man. A Person "Wow, just wow"? When he can vote in our elections I'll take his opinions of our elections seriously. It is highly ill-informed anyhow. Paul Sterling A person wins! Marcelove Timeout, you are a Trump supporter? No interest in your opinion (neither anyone smart in the world). Roy Riddex Just so I'm clear on this, by unlocked are we talking about SIM unlocked? lomsha No no, unlocked bootloader. Roy Riddex Thanks Corbin Davenport Unlocked bootloader. pbergonzi I wonder how long they'll stick with that premise seeing as how much public opinion expressed here is against them. Screw them. Get the APK somewhere else or install magisk and hide your root. Too many people root their devices and have a good reason for doing so and Netflix should not penalize them. Doby Gillis Dude, normal people don't give a fuck about rooted phones. It's just the elitist twats who do it anymore. twiz0r Dude, you're an elitist twat. Richard Markert Most people who root seem to be. The sentiment among rooters is "if you don't root your phone, you're not as good as me and don't deserve to have a phone. Root you stupid noob!" twiz0r thanks for confirming your twatness. good day. C64 One word ..... Bullshit Corey Kinard I've yet to see that... Maybe you just feel like that because they do in fact know more than you? Richard Markert My first version of Android was 1.5. I've seen it for many years. How long have you been in the scene? My1 well at least a rooted phone is objectively better than a non rooted one, but relatively and subjectively speaking, if a non-rooted phone is good enough for someone then let it be so. EowynCarter My phone isn't rooted. And not compatible anymore ! Franco Fassio Unlocked bootloader maybe? EowynCarter Yes. But seam I can't lock it without wipe. So screw you Netflix. Marcelove Let me guess, your profile pic is that right? https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/0f0c4f3e3ce40074aebfe58d80511d4a0b7d4a94896ce54d82e448a1cd2e3ceb.jpg bruce lancaster Dude. It isn't just rooted phones - Also unlocked. Elitists get their iphones and galaxy s8s from att and verizon. Normal people get their devices from amazon, ebay, newegg, gearbest etc. Jimk4003 I'm sure Netflix are terrified that the tiny fraction of Android users who come to this site, and the similarly tiny fraction who root their phones, are bothered. The rest of the world won't care. bruce lancaster An article in Wireless Week (cellphone industry rag) a couple of months back says it's now a majority of phones in Asia that are unlocked and Europe is getting pretty close to 50/50. US passed 30% unlocked around Christmas. People aren't getting their phones from ATT, Verizon, etc any more now that they have to pay full retail and don't get a free or heavily discounted flagship device with contract renewal. They are getting them from Amazon, Gearbest, Newegg, etc and moving their sim. If I owned stock in Netflix right now, I'd sell it quick on this news. Everything that isn't already mobile is going mobile. Alienating half the European market and 30% of the US market is asinine. Fedup Yup. Ditched my flagship Samsung phone for a 'budget' Moto G5 Plus that is 100% compatible with all four US carriers (and their dozens of MNVOs). Swapping providers is as easy as changing the sim. And despite the slower spec'ed hardware, the carrier bloat-free Nougat is WAY faster than my TW Galaxy phone - and the battery life is INSANE. C64 Probably 90 % of the people don't know what root is. Almost every person I know owns an Android device, but i'm the only geek who flashes and roots his devices bruce lancaster It isn't just rooted phones but also unlocked phones. Got your phone on amazon? Got it on ebay? Got it from gearbest? Got it from newegg? Yup. No netflix for you without jumping through enough hoops that you'll actually know about rooting by the time you get it done. Fedup Are we conflating a carrier-unlocked vs. bootloader unlocked phone? They are two distinctly different things, and I doubt that having a carrier-unlocked phone (i.e. using a TMO phone on ATT, or VZ on Sprint) has any impact on SafetyNet or Widevine. pbergonzi Judging from the posts here it looks like nobody who roots their phone uses Netflix anyway so I guess it's moot. But the outcry sure did get them a bunch of free publicity. T4rd This is what Magisk is for. Pretty sure if I can still use Android Pay with my rooted 6P, I can still use/update Netflix through the Play Store. Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ Magisk still requires that you unlock your bootloader, which is enough to trigger safety net these days, so that won't work. TechGuy22 You don't know how magisk works do you Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ I understand that Magisk is a great tool for modifying my system without actually modifying it. I understand that there are many modules that allow you to do things like hide root, bypass security modules, skin your system, and plenty of other things. What I don't understand is how you can install magisk without unlocking your bootloader. Back when I originally tried it out with pokemon go, it worked well for a while, but eventually even just having my bootloader unlocked was all it took to throw SafetyNet. If that's not an issue anymore, then great! But maybe say that instead of being snarky. Thomas Gladdines Bootloader can be simply locked after rooting and installing a custom recovery. Edwin O. Lol no You could, but then you can't flash anything with said recovery... So no point Thomas Gladdines LOL the recovery doesn't stop working after a bootloader is locked, only fastboot won't flash images but the recovery can do whatever it wants to, update the rom, edit system files etc. Muzzy996 Well as an example for the Google Pixel: https://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=71901761&postcount=454 In this case all it takes is a kernel that supports Magisk and hides the fact that the bootloader is unlocked, at which point with Magisk Hide enabled all root and SafetyNet checks pass. Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ Excellent. I'll have to look back into this then, last time I used magisk it wasn't as capable, glad to see it's come this far. sbeaulieu Magical Hide is there for that Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ Can Magical Hide hide that my bootloader is unlocked? Serious question, not being sarcastic or snarky as I was below. sbeaulieu It does make the SafetyNet check pass iJeggu Magisk itself doesn't hide an unlocked bootloader it only hides root but must custom roms simply delete the verifiedbootstate -flag which in turn makes safetynet pass even with an unlocked bootloader. Some older devices don't have this flag in their kernels in the first place so safetynet will accept that the flag is missing. Link to the patch that most custom roms (kernels to be specific) have to pass safetynet: https://github.com/sultanxda/android_kernel_oneplus_msm8996/commit/abc05b16bbd33521c2fffaf491c5657a94bfcfc5 https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/5b1ff3f47e32d5f57ddadcd650a5b94725bd4e6242cea92e269f51e988d0d426.png T4rd Except it's working for me right now... jonzey231 This has been happening for a week now. I tweeted it to Ruddock a few days ago. Just didn't put together that it was because I was unlocked. https://twitter.com/jonzey231/status/862122438125072384 steelew Google really needs to start stealing from the root community the way apple takes from the jailbreak community. It feels like rooting is way down except for a few (legal) use cases. If it weren't for visual tweaks & usability tweaks, I would have no need to root (personally). This kind of stuff starts to make rooting unpleasant. I already can't use fingerprint auth in my banking app any more because root. Jesús Cuenca They do. I used rooms for like 8 years maybe? And a lot of the "new features" always come of the rom or root comunity. Right now i use roms, but not root. Marcelove I'm trying to stay indoors, but is complicate... Greenify for example, works at no root devices nowadays... But is way better with root and Xposed... Doze can't compare against Greenify... Maybe at version number 20 root wouldn't be necessary... Sandeep Raghuraman What about the version downloaded from Amazon app store though? Does that work fine? TwoBit Gary It worked, but it is old version without show downloads. Go to apkmirror oculairmedia Interesting move. I flashed a custom ROM on my Nexus 6 because stock was so slow that it was getting unusable, but screw me right ? Atoqir In my country lots of stuff doesn't work on unrooted devices. My bank app, payment app and local cable TV and digicorder app all stopped working. Also s-health doesn't work anymore and soon Netflix. Time to unroot Marcelove "Time to unroot" Sheep. Richard Markert Rooting is insecure. You don't need to access the system partition except to break things. Benjamin Walburn If that were the case then this wouldn't be an issue. Nobody is looking to break their phone. Richard Markert Few people I've talked to online know what they're doing when it comes to root. Most of those end up breaking things. Rooting is far too easy and probably shouldn't exist at all. Benjamin Walburn You could say the same about anything, not just modification of phones. Maybe you shouldn't own a car if you can't fix it yourself, or have kids if you aren't a doctor. Rooting isn't easy, it's made easy by the hard work of other people. It's not up to you what other people do with their property, you have no right to say that they shouldn't. And if someone breaks their phone, what does it have to do with you? It's their hobby and their phone. You're not their daddy. senoredusty Or use Magisk DJMix No need. You could use magisk su hide for the moment. it still passes the safetynet. I too use a banking app that cannot be used on normal root proocess faceless128 "please stop giving us money and use Kodi instead" Sounds like a great business plan! JD For the sake of Kodi's developers don't say Kodi in that context. ericshmerick Hrmm, every time I hear Kodi, I think of pirated content. Guess when people are like "I use Kodi for my 30TB media collection" I stop and wonder how... Yes, ripping a lifetime of DVDs, but nah. Probably piracy. C64 I know a few how really use it legally Powsniffer0110 Yea I use it legally 95% of the time. ErectBipedal nah man, I use Kodi to browse my 30TB of linux isos. Totally legit I swear. Chazz Matthews Torrents are legal too. Just depends on the content. Mike Honestly though, if pirate add-ons wern't available on kodi, 98% of the people using it now would not have even heard of it before. Even bad publicity is good publicity. They are not going to publicly come out and say it, but the add-on's are the only reason they're well known. Andy Roid But kodi makes piracy so easy! Blian Oh god, please stop. Nobody is using Kodi for their DVD rips. Railwayman I rather say Fusion and Exodus et al instead since Kodi is... Kodi and you have to install what you want. The Netflix business plan is for her more people on Exodus, Phoenix and SALTS - not to mention Terrarium TV and MovieBox as well. Kevin Strident Kodi is open source. If Kodi stops wanting to be as useful as it is now, someone will fork it and keep it doing what its users enjoy. cbstryker Kodi is just an open source media player. To watch any pirated content you either need to download it or install an unaffiliated plugin that streams from pirated sources. C64 Next kodi wil have drm build in. So people have to use forks. I stopped using kodi since i found Teranium TV. cbstryker That makes zero sense. Kodi's reason for existing would stop. C64 That's BS my friend, Kodi (xbmc) has started on the original xbox and was made and used as a media player My1 actually it depends on how the build the DRM, if it's made to be only active when you are for example streaming netflix and does nothing for local content, which for sure can be legal (e.g. ripping DVDs in finland is no problem because CSS is not considered an "effective" protection method ever since 2007) although if the DRM would be everywhere it wouldnt be funny. Justin D Same...but with Plex and something else >.> Dany Lol I know right? I was using Kodi more than Netflix anyway so... Dmitry Stepanushkin Xposed + RootCloak or something similar will do it for most of apps for those who need root. So I think not a big problem. Abhishek Saral Not a big problem but a big annoyance. tehboogieman Hmm, rootcloak isn't working for me with netflix m477 No, it won't work. Safetynet always fails if you have closed activated, or if you just have an unlocked bootloader. Sometimes even by just having adb debugging turned on. My1 debugging is a joke right? If it's not WHAT ARE THEY DOING? I mean debugging is a core part of developing and any developer probably has it active m477 I've only seen it working like that once, so it might be an isolated case. Kan☆n MagiskSU and its manager app comes with a very good hider built-in. No Xposed needed. h4rr4r Beyond pointless. Netflix won by being easier than piracy, this threatens to turn back the clock on that. Lexster These companies don't seem to get that most people pirate because it's easier/cheaper than buying what they want. Yes, it's wrong, whatever, the point is streaming services made it easier for people, which outweighed the hassle of pirating it. You're right, this kind of thing is what will get people to start doing it again more. BobButtons If I can't use Netflix on my rooted phone, it's Netflix that'll go, not the root. They're encouraging piracy. YaKillaCJ Exactly. Screw it, I only have Netflix for convenience. This will also have negative impact on many devices and average consumers even if they never unlock or root. A lot don't have Google certification, such as upcoming OEMs. Then theirs beta roms like Xiaomi and OnePlus that run awesome. Marcelove Funny thing: I was about to become a subscriber of Netflix after seeing House of Cards by PirateBay but now through the official channel because I thought that Netflix deserved my money... Look : deservED... But this movie will keep me at PirateBay... Funny thing 2: I have a Moto G5 that I could unlock and root and I didn't it just because I wanna see how things are nowadays without root... And I use a lot of apps that would work better with root (Greenify for example)... So I would be able to use Netflix... And I won't and will stay that way only because this douchebag move... Congratulations Netflix... Funny thing 3: So happy that I waited till House of Cards release to become a subscriber... Netflix should learn something from Frank Underwood... And from Blockbuster... tim242 Yeah, sure you were. Once a thief, always a thief. koiulpoi This is the most untrue statement I've read on this website. Thomas Elephants can fly 天地人 http://gadling.com/2012/06/10/airline-transports-herd-of-african-elephants-photos/ koiulpoi Nice! You matched it. 天地人 Yes, because illegally pirating from huge corperations which constantly attempt to and successfully brainwash people into agenda using various tricks, is somehow bad? You're not supporting the creators of the show, sure. But you're also not supporting the 6 Jewish companies that control 90% of American media. Anyways, with your little money you wouldn't be benefitting anybody. Do you honestly think those Jewish companies are dying to get a hold of your $120 you payed for Netflix this year? Probably not. The creators of the show, are well off anyways. Don't companies pay them to have their content on their platform and pay for their production cost and wages? Then; they've already been payed. I'm not endorsing piracy. It isn't the best thing to do, but I think calling people a "thief" and grouping them with people who have actually stolen things off individuals which mean a lot to the individual and murdered some individuals in the process, is just stupid. It's not the same as 'stealing' bits of 1s and 0s. Again, I'm not endorsing piracy, however there are a lot of good reasons to pirate movies and TV shows. Paul Sterling You're a thief. People leave their families for months to give you works of art. Games, movies, music. You can't throw them a few bucks? I'm legit, always will be. Also, tax helps everyone. Your wall of text is just trying to convince yourself, thief. 天地人 Nope. A thief is different from a pirate, besides, they've already been payed. And I was talking about TV shows and movies, but you're too dense to realise it. jj14x Not the same. If I spend time writing code for software, and decide to sell a monthly license instead of a perpetual license, that is my choice. Your choice should be to either subscribe to the monthly license, or to find a competitor software to use instead. Choosing to bypass the licensing checks makes you a thief (taking something without the owner's permission makes you a thief). And same logic applies to TV shows/movies. If you want to own the movie and watch it whenever you want it, BUY it. "illegally pirating from huge corperations which constantly attempt to and successfully brainwash people into agenda using various tricks, is somehow bad?"<-- YES - it is still illegal. Just because somebody stole your car doesn't mean you can go and steal that person's car in retaliation. There are laws and procedures on how to handle that. STDog Illegal != bad, legal != good. Thousands of unjust laws have been passed. They made actions illegal that were not bad. My1 well yeah if you actually bypass the thing you are a pirate (not a thief because stealing != illegal copy) but branding people pirates and making the software refuse if something that MIGHT be used for piracy is on the device isnt not better. Richard Markert It's trickle-down, man. Think about if everybody thought like you. Netflix has 100 million subs and each pay at the minimum $107/yr and that's 10.7 billion. Now if that 10.7 billion were wiped out in an instant, how is Netflix going to make new shows or seasons of existing shows? It's the same with the rest of the content creation business. You and me, we're just a drop in the bucket when it comes to their revenue, but instead of scooping it out a spoonful at a time while adding water by the cup, somebody dumped the bucket over, there would be no money left to pay the content creators before content is even made. Railwayman I guess you like DRM and proprietary vendor lock in? The only moral of the story is: Pay for legit services then and watch posted content - the creators get paid and you get proper content without restrictions. The day the industry realize that DRM, geo blocking and so forth are counter productive will be historic. My1 well I would and I do give my money for legal media consumption when possible but when some things have region locks, meaning I cant import them or other stupid Ideas like Netflix not doing rooted devices, I certainly wouldnt like giving money for something I cant use. My1 not really. I have streamed and/or downloaded stuff in the past (coz not available here) just to buy their blurays years after when it finally came to germany Fedup Love my Moto G5 Plus. Best phone I've had so far - and that's coming from a number of Samsung flagship phones. It's so much snappier and the battery life is insane. I waited a full 48 hours before caving and unlocking/rooting. Haven't looked back. I hate ads, and w/o root, you can't miracast to anything other than chromecast. Trysta Noticed this a little while ago. The crazy thing is I'm not even rooted or interested in any mods. I needed to sideload the latest version 7.1.2 because my RMA Nexus 6p refused to update on its own. I'm keeping the bootloader unlocked so I can recover if my phone boot loops. I rarely use Netflix on my phone but this is kind of annoying. I suspect this has something to do with offline movie watching (which is amazing). jj14x You don't need to unlock bootloader to sideload the full OTA images that Google publishes on their website. Tim Harman But you do need it to recover in your phone bootloops, as he said. jj14x True, but by that logic, everyone should keep their phone's bootloader unlocked all the time (because a bootloop, in theory, could happen to anyone/anytime) - not just when flashing a factory image. My1 but doesnt the actual unlock wipe everything? EowynCarter You don't ? Had to when installing a developper preview. Then I left it that way, so I won't be locked out in case of boot loop. TedPhillips or when you have some random block on disk get corrupted, ala nexus 9. ilovetesla Dumbest blocking I've ever heard Bruce Wayne I stopped rooting ages ago. Android has gotten so good that I don't need it anymore. Muzzy996 Good for you! Not everyone feels the same though, I know I sure don't. Tasker, Adaway, Greenify, Titanium, Substratum and GMD Gesture Controls are all more important to me than Netflix. The day Netflix stops working on my rooted devices (which are what I watch it on, not my TV) is the day I'll cancel my service. No big loss compared to losing root. Richard Markert Tasker is interesting but never felt the need for it. Adaway, titanium are both irrelevant on my S7, I despise gestures beyond simple swiping in the Cardinal directions, and if stock Android is so perfect why do you need to theme it? C64 I have a s7 edge and the stockrom is full of bloatware from Microsoft, Sansung and Google. More than 20 useless apps are included. So yes the s7 needed root. tim242 Wrong. Package Disabler, no root required. Richard Markert No, it doesn't. Everything not necessary for function is disableable. C64 You can't disable everything Muzzy996 Never said android is perfect, if it was there wouldn't be any competition in the market or users such as myself who feel the need to customize Android. Root is not something I push onto others, its just something that I want on my devices and I make choices about what services I use or devices I purchase based upon my ability to do it. Railwayman I take that you like ads, then? Using a non-rooted Samsung without Taller would be like using a feature phone again but with ads. Having an automated device without ads and bloat is certainly a basic requirement to me. Richard Markert Adhell and Disconnect pro. What's an ad? Railwayman I don't see any ads on my Ericsson GF388 either. Don't have to install a single piece of software in order to get there. Ericsson win, Samsung loose.:) Your Samsung still has Google ad services and so forth running even if you are blocking them on the "non root level". My devices are completely ad free with Google ads disabled system wide and in all apps. Samsung loose every time even if their followers are trying to find different "non root methods" to "solve" things that other devices do without any issues due to... root. kostas110 maybe if you use some 500+ euro smartphone from 2016-2017 something that not everyone can do C64 I disagree, Android is one big advertising if you don't use root. Apps have ads (not every app has a pro version), internet browsing sucks without Adaway (build in ad blockers in browsers aren't great), YouTube really sucks if it isn't modded (watch a 30 second ad for a 3 minute movie). And devices are full of bloatware that can't be removed without root. Even the Google stuff are bloatware (kiosk, movies,music,books etc). I also like to remove alot of system apps and replace them with my own apps that i prefer (file manager, agenda, email, music/ video player) and i really hate duplicate apps on my devices. Also Titanium Backup is important to me. So Android​ without root isn't Android for me. jetscreamer01 I use adguard to block stupid ads in my apps. Now using any commercial apps is enjoyable. Richard Markert Samsung's Internet has the Adblock extension and it literally blocks everything. I also use Disconnect Pro and Adhell for system-wide ad blocking. Titanium Backup I never really used even back when I was rooting phones - it has been replaced 100% by Smart Switch. But then, I haven't needed to restore a backup (except for switching devices) in years, probably because I don't run janky community junkroms. Muzzy996 The only reason you feel that Smart Switch completely replaces Titanium is because you never used other features of Titanium that go beyond what Smart Switch is intended for. Things like shortcuts to freeze/defrost apps, multiple version backups or market management are useful to some even if they're on rooted stock OEM ROMs. They're not must haves for the masses though but some of us do appreciate their usefulness. Cyber_Akuma I hate this response. If anything, I have found far more reasons to root than ever before. Being able to create a backup image and install security/tracking software tat can't just be wiped/uninstalled easily is a big one for example. Captain_Invisible But you don't even need to root to get blocked. Just using a custom ROM or having an unlocked bootloader triggers it.. DJMix I really couldn't understand these kind of stupid moves. I mean I kinda get for an Android Pay or some banking apps to implement these limitations. But seriously, a frickin' streaming app? Afraid they're gonna get pirated? For someone who's going to pirate, they probably could just probably reverse engineer the apk and remove the limitations or basically use older apps. Do they really have some idle engineers that they're forced to implement useless feature? ddevito Guess I'll just pirate it all soon. Their loss. JD Fuck Android If OEMs would fucking provide updates for 5 years I wouldn't need to unlock my bootloader. I'm out. I'll come back when Google fixes this shit. Also fuck Netflix. Back to pirating it is. Christopher Bement My app stopped working on my N7 when I sideloaded 5.0. Got an error when trying to play anything. I went and dropped it back to stock on the latest patch and relocked the bootloader. All working fine now. Too fucking bad, Nougat is fantastic on that device, leaps and bounds better than Marshmallow. tehboogieman Which ROM and which N7 do you have? I still have the stock ROM on my 2013 N7 LTE and have been procrastinating loading an N ROM on it Christopher Bement 2013 LTE version and I was using Nitrogen OS (fantastic and stable ROM). I am now on the latest Marshmallow just so that Netflix will work. tehboogieman As long as I can side load it and sign in I'm still ok. It's a pain, but I'd live with that. But if NF blocks root users from signing in, I'm definitely cancelling and just use one of the very easy pirate apps. Fedup As long as you can side load... Sure. But going from "hidden app in the Play store" to "sideloaded app won't run" is probably on the menu. Wayne Randall I just signed up for Netflix so I could cancel it. I'm part of the group. tim242 You paid them... Richard Markert Hahahahahaha I don't even use Netflix on my phone (screen is too small) so I don't care. But man, the tears and butthurt from the root community is hilarious. Benjamin Walburn You're a very petty child. Richard Markert When something makes me laugh, I point it out. I do that even have a dog in this hunt. I only watch Netflix on my 75" LED TV. I'm just tired of root users smugness. Almost as smug as apple users. Benjamin Walburn You're tired of people being smug in their hobbies, so you gloat about the problems inflicted on them pointlessly? Petty and a hypocrite. Richard Markert What else am I supposed to do to remove the smugness? My name is…. Get a life maybe? Benjamin Walburn Why should you? Is another person's happiness really that painful for you? You already know that they accomplished nothing more than "successfully followed instructions." It seems like your purpose would be better served by targeting that, not just being a jerk. Humbling them is one thing, being an ass is another entirely. tim242 You sound like the petty child. Stomp your foot, becauseyou don't get your way. Benjamin Walburn Not only am I not doing that, I'm not not getting my way, and "stomping​ my foot" is not an example of pettiness. Your wrongness-density is impressive. My name is…. Who beat you as a child? Richard Markert Lol koiulpoi You're on androidpolice.com... making fun of the root community... and unable to see past the end of your nose... Don't you have anything better to do? Richard Markert Actually, no. I read Android police because they have the best coverage of software. koiulpoi I didn't realize I replied to you twice. You're all over this article, with really, nothing better to do, huh? Richard Markert Yeah, I'm bored. I'm probably done stirring shit up anyway, today is water change day on my fish tanks. lomsha Tard Railwayman Are you one of those Samsung Apologists that argue against root and proudly tell everyone about the perfection known as Grace UX... just to install Package Dsabler Pro because... something disturb all "perfectness" of their system? Trying to be an "anti-social elitist" is like proudly use Simple Finder on a Mac and tell everyone that you don't need the regular Finder.;) Richard Markert I use Samsung, but only because it offers the best mix of software and hardware for me. And package disablers are garbage. Railwayman I avoid Samsung like a plague because of Knox 0x1 Warranty Void, Grace UX (TW...) and pretty ugly hardware not to mention the software design, which looks like a cheap toy, both colors, design and all S-This and S-That they preinstall. Don't forget DT Ignite so the carriers can add their share. It is always amusing when the Samsung Apologist proudly claim how good it is to live without root and how "mature Android has become" when they are talking about a heavily modified fork of it. If Samsung could replace Google Play with Galaxy Apps, they would. The only thing restricting them from further modification is the CTS in order to be able to use Play. An unrooted Samsung running Grace? It would be like having a feature phone again. Way too many annoyances and no way of making it more pleasurable since the whole thing is... Samsung. The only area where there are some reminiscence of Android is under the About box. Samsung is a disgrace not to mention a complete parody on the concept of an Android device. Not to mention their followers who recently "spotted" the bezel less display (introduced by Sharp and LG followed by Xiaomi) because... the S 8 got it AND suddenly made it a "requirement". The most kind thing I can say about that brand is this: Samsung is for the Android device and platform what McDonald's is for the thing called food.;) There are way better devices available. Buying a Samsung is like getting a Big Mac (the difference is that the Big Mac buyers doesn't claim its superiority - while Samsung buyers always try to claim how "superior" their devices are). Richard Markert Everything in your first paragraph is purely subjective. I find the design of the Pixel to be ugly, boring and derivative. AOSP design language doesn't appeal to me. I also think Samsung's software suite is better than Google's. My 935U doesn't have DTIgnite, but my 935V does...as does the Verizon branded V20, Moto Turbo2, etc. DTIgnite is a Verizon thing. Bezel less phones are sexy, for sure. That Sharp device was a Sharp device, and the Xiaomi has a CDMA radio so I could use it on Verizon , but just can't justify buying a thousand dollar device from China. It is stupidly gorgeous though. I use Samsung because I like the software design. I like the functionality of the base is and apps, and I like the S-app suite. I really miss my Note 7, and I'll be swapping up to a Note 8 when it's out. Don't get me wrong, Samsung phones have their negatives - chief among them is the fragile design and the screen edge touch rejection sucks ass. But for me, the positives outweigh the negatives. Other phones have bigger negatives for me. No IP68, no uSD card, no wireless charging, no SAMOLED display. Phone preference are always subjective. Somebody will always have a reason to pick one over another. Tell me, if Samsung is a "parody" of the concept of an Android device, what is your description of the perfect Android device? I'm guessing it's the Pixel. Railwayman Pixel is an ugly iPhone clone. The best Android device so far would be something like a Xiaomi Mi Mix running Resurrection Remix or similar ROM or something like a Mi Max but with perfection added through a Snapdragon 835, 256GB storage plus microSDand 6-8GB RAM paired with a 1440p 6.44" display or even 4K. 5000-6000 mAh battery. My Xiaomi Mi Max is excellent but would be even better with the aforementioned hardware (I can't fault is existing hardware but I am taking about a new model). A keyboard flipcover would be a great accessory as well. There are no device yet worthy of the perfect moniker yet but my Max is the best thing so far in my collection beside the Nokia Communicators and HTC TP2 and HD2 and also the Xperia Z Ultra when I do the holistic judgment. IP68? Sony all the way to me if I really insist. MicroSD? No need for a Samsung in order to get it. Yes, Samsung is a kind of a parody of an Android device die to their heavy modifications, restrictive policies, low price /performance ratio, carrier branding and Knox 0x1 Warranty Void. The upcoming OnePlus 5 looks promising - they usually get their things right. MicroSD on that one as well.;) If Samsung make a device without any BS such as restrictions, carrier links paired with good price / performance ratio I would be interested. Let's call it a Note Pro. What I don't like with Samsung are all Apologists making excuses for their policies. I have nothing against them as a company or production. They can make excellent products but their policies stop them right now. It is too much McDonald's mainstream and too little class at this time. Carrier devices are typically too mainstream than the unlocked ones. My1 well knox flag is annoying but I honestly like my Galaxy Note 4 which is the last good Samsung in my opinion becase anything later either doesnt have microSD, doesnt have a swappable batter or doesnt have both (Galaxy S6 for example) but these are 2 very important things and I really like some parts of the samsung rom, although a lot of other parts (e.g. the launcher) are junk and get replaced instantly, also root makes the thing work as I want. and well many non samsung devices use the on-screen navigation bar, one thing I despise after having a horrible experience on my tablet. and (at least outside of samsung) the fiun goes on with removing the headphone jack which is something on my absolute instant KO list for phones. I dont see the point of a digital sound connection on a phone because sound itself is analog by definition and I think the DAC in a multi-hundred euro device is better than in some cheap headphones. and not to forget the features. samsung had many features WAY earlier than AOSP did, which certainly doesnt make it so much better at least from this viewpoint, although aosp is certainly getting better with every version. but even though I like my note 4 I must say that it is by no means perfect. everything is better and worse than others if you put the right requirements in. MadMartigan What are are you, seven? me me A primary reason to root is to run adblock because Google is way too greedy. So the irony, Google's greed means there's less reason to pay for NetFlix. Let me guess... shall we? Google Play Movies still works right...? Oh yes, so long as Google makes their money.... tim242 I block ads with Adguard. No root required. Mike | Homeless On Wheels People still use Netflix? Bit Torrent is your friend. dizel123 Exactly. Everyone should stop using Netflix. Not sure how I'm gonna get the shows i currently watch on Netflix from bit torrent since they won't be made anymore once Netflix is shut down, but at least I'll have my bit torrent friend tim242 Some people like to do things properly. Railwayman You mean - Do it with DRM? You can't buy whatever device you want because a content provider disagree. You can't use the system you want because a content provider disagree. You can't use the app you want because a content provider disagree. I need a lot of apps, ads and limitations for the so called "proper way" . The "improper way" is Samsung free, ad free and bloat free - and I don't need several apps because I have just one or two streaming apps, one media player, one book reader and so on. Fast and efficient system to boot. I think I prefer to do things "improperly". Richard Markert >The "improper way" is Samsung free, ad free and bloat free - and I don't need several apps because I have just one or two streaming apps, one media player, one book reader and so on. Fast and efficient system to boot. *sigh* I bet you think deleting the APKs from /system actually gives you more space in /data, too. Railwayman Perhaps you can tell me the benefit of having Kindle, Kobo and Nook instead of MoonReader for everything. The benefits of having an uprooted system, Netflix, Hulu and a couple of apps for different cable services instead of having just one media center would also be interesting to know more about. When we are at it: Why would I want to use a 3GB+ Samsung ROM when Resurrection Remix are 600 MB and the G-Apps around 340 MB? Richard Markert I dont use any of those. Phones are too small for media consumption. I don't have any video streaming or playback apps on my phone. Nor do I have book readers, but why wouldnt I want Kindle? It's the only way to access the Amazon library... Oh wait, I forgot, you do that believe in compensating content creators. Resurrection remix, really? If I put that on my S7 edge, I'd be wiping out half the hardware's capabilities in one blow. No Samsung pay, no edge panels, no pro mode camera, no AOD, no game tools, no GearVR. And im sure none of the little things I've come to expect in my UI, like direct calling and sliding a contact to call/txt. But I can move the clock to the other side of the notification shade, woohoo! Oh and does the installer for RR rom repartition the file system? Because if not, /system will still be 3gb, not 600mb. And on top of that, I'm immediately reminded of iOS when I looked at their screenshots. Railwayman So RR looks like iOS? Interesting. It looks like Android with Material Design on my device. I buy Kindle books but send them through a plug-in since the Kindle app pretty much suck in comparison with MoonReader. Sometimes I also buy from Google Play Books and it is also a trip through the plug-in for them and then into the MoonReader library. You see - DRM is a stupidity that must go way unless they create a device wide scheme so any app can authenticate and show or play back the content. I understand that Samsung phones are too small for media consumption. A 6.44-7 inch display is different - it works comfortably without the heft of a 10-12 inch tablet. Small displays below 6-6.3 inches are just too small. So your listed features of your Samsung are hardware? They certainly sound like software to me. Or do you seriously believe that Samsung use co-processors in their device like Commodore did on the Amiga? I can assure you that your Samsung contain standard hardware with a lot of subcontracted components, especially in the US market where they even use Qualcomm CPUs. Samsung Pay? Why would I use an OEM dependent payment system? My credit cards follow a standard, why should I pick myself into a specific device OEM just to pay? It makes no sense. It is like having a car that only runs on Citgo gas or a 4" Visa card requiring different terminals than my 4.5" MasterCard. Mobile payments will be a thing when a standard are in place. Payment systems requiring me to lock myself into a specific OEM just suck. Edge panels? Don't see the need. Don't like Edge displays with their optical side effects. Flat display or just slight roundness on the edges like the BlackBerry PRIV here. Pro Mode Camera? I prefer to have the Open Camera API so any app can get RAW from the sensor and do their thing rather than locking myself into the default camera app. I prefer Camera FV-5 or A Better Camera etc. The Snap Camera is good too. Always on display? Can set it up on my device but don't see the need when there are things such as Active Display and a lot of other options. Game tools? I don't see any problems with gaming on other Android versions so I just don't see what Samsung can add in this regard. Gear VR? Why would I want to strap my device to my face when there are dedicated VR headsets available for gaming consoles and computers? I certainly prefer to have a full headset rather than using my device as one. Call features? They could be good but carrier calling is old fashioned. I use Google Voice instead and wouldn't consider going back to carrier talk and text. Don't see any benefit with having a phone number tied to a carrier of SIM card. Having more than one for different purposes on the same device without SIM dependency is the modern way. I don't know if RR repartition Samsung devices so you have to check XDA. That brand is probably the worst when it comes to ROMs anyway and a lot of my dislike of them are related to that particular issue. Samsung is nothing more than the Big Mac of Android devices and no Gear VR or Samsung Pay (it is like having a McDonald's Pay) really change anything. A mainstream device with mainstream design with too many round edges and corners not to say fragile, batteries that wear out fast due to lower quality and fast charge (which stresses the cells heavily), a software design looking "something" , bloat ware, carrier BS such as bloat ware and also the price model, Knox and root/ROM restrictions, locked bootloadern - the list goes on and on. Mainstream degenerated art is what Samsung represents. But I know the existence of people who don't believe in freedom of choice other than the freedom of buying their Samsung from their carrier and then happily oblige and reduction imposed to them all the way down to the SIM card dependent phone number and roaming charges when they travel.;) They also consider Samsung Pay to be the best thing ever - a payment system that only work on a particular OEM. It really is like a car that require Citgo gas and is unable to run on Exxon or Esso fuel. Samsung just are the Big Mac of Android devices. There are just nothing "classy" over such a carrier mainstream brand. If you want to know what luxury are? Look at Vertu. Richard Markert A 7" device is too small. My tablets start at 10" minimum , and go to 12" maximum. Content consumption is unpleasant on anything smaller, and I barely watch anything on a display smaller than one of my 24" computer displays. Yes, you're right almost all of them are software features, but they are locked out when you put a junkrom on there. And Samsung Pay? Well, call me when Android Pay is compatible with magstripe readers. My bank still doesn't support Android Pay that I know of, either. GearVR. How shall I put this? Computer VR is currently overpriced - unless you want to go ahead and buy me a $600 headset, a pair of controllers @ $130 each, AND you still need to buy me a $1400 PC to run VR titles at an acceptable framerate, because while my laptop can still run AAA titles at high framerates and 1080p, it can't do VR that good. My GearVR cost me $50, it's a convenience thing, every VR title is locked 60fps, the graphics are "good enough" and I can even take calls from VR with my Bluetooth headphones. I don't care about Google Voice. Or any sort of data-based calling. US data networks are still too unstable and limited. I am pretty much guaranteed to be able to make a call anywhere I can see at least the tiniest bit of 1x signal, but if the data network is gone, or you used all your gigabytes, you can't make calls anymore on your preferred number. A lot of these things you say you simply "don't need" them, and that's how I feel about root. And about pretty much everything you care about. I don't do ebooks, I don't do movies or tv, I barely play basic games. I do listen to a LOT of music though, and yes a lot of it was stolen from when I was younger and stupider and didn't understand that without compensation there will be no content. Oh, and BTW, Knox is a good thing. It's how I have system-wide ad blocking without rooting, and how I can have my Secure Folder. You seriously think Vertu phones are luxury? Classy even! Vertu are tacky, garish and gaudy. "Look at how much money I have." Nothing classy about that ugly diamond-crusted turd. Look, I really don't care what your choices are. I'm glad you have the choice to find a device that makes you happy. But you seriously need to stop acting like your choice is the only choice. It's not. And I hope to god it never will be, because at that point, Android will no longer be a platform that fits my needs and I might as well go to Apple. Because you see, what fits my needs, is a device that provides me with everything I have, out of the box, without having to modify it. Samsung does that. They give me everything I want, and nothing I don't. And when the Note 8 comes out, the S-Pen is going to blast it so far ahead that there simply won't be any other phone in the running, not even the S9. I would still have my Note 7 if they would let me. derp_cookies So I agree this is a dumb move but everyone is overreacting by threatening to pirate content. This is a niche problem as less people root now, especially since Android pay won't work when you do it. So Netflix isn't any less accessible than it was before. I watch 99% of Netflix at home on my Roku. Luxferro It's not just rooting. My Nexus 6P is running stock google rom, no root, w/ just unlocked bootloader, and netflix is gone in my play store. Not that I watch TV on my phone... but my shield tv is also unlocked... so it's probably just a matter of time. Roh_Mish Dammit Netflix, you make me want to go popcorn time route. My current primary phone and my iPad are what I use to watch netflix and both of them is stock so i don't have anything to worry about but this just feels wrong. Between this and Amazon not releasing the TV app for my sony TV, which they support outside, popcorn time (and in extension piracy) just seems easier. Vivek Rameses This is why we have piracy. Miguel Angel But ...why? occono Distributors want Netflix to stop any possibility of making DRM-Free backups on the content. Railwayman Good luck with that. If it can be played, it can be recorded. As long as the Netflix content is visible somewhere a copy can be recorded so again, good luck with blocking. Mariano Moreira Even more strange is while Netflix app is removed from Playstore, Netflix VR is still.in Playstore. Manually flashing Factory Image for Google Pixel is how I get me OS updates and I choose to leave bootloader unlocked, rather than relocking every month.(which would include full wipe) So I guess they don't care about security for the few users whom might use Netflix VR with Daydream compatible device? tehboogieman I'm not familiar with the Pixel, but almost every Nexus device lets you lock without wiping all your data. Maybe that requires root though, I really don't understand the details on how it works, but hopefully you can find a way to do it. Mariano Moreira To clarify: In order for me to install Factory Image every month, I need to have Bootloader unlocked. Doing the Factory unlock will wipe the device. Locking the device doesn't wipe the device, but Factory unlocking the bootloader will wipe the device. tehboogieman Yeah, sorry I wasn't more specific. I use an app called BootUnlocker. It lets you lock and unlock the bootloader without wiping at will. Since an app can do this, I'm assuming that it can be done via ADB. Also it might only work on older devices, but maybe there's a way to replicate this action on newer devices as well Mariano Moreira I don't understand why Google is promoting Security by having the device fully-locked, yet still relies on ADB fastboot unlock/OEM Unlock commands to flash factory images? saf1927 Why are using factory images when Google provides OTA images too, and these don't require an unlocked bootloader, nor a wipe? jdrch It's not just Netflix. The HDHomeRun Prime app doesn't work on rooted 7.0+ devices either. Jsilvermist Good to know, will no longer recommend Netflix to anyone when I'm asked... James F News flash: when you explain to most normal people why you don't recommend Netflix, they won't care, because it doesn't affect them. D13H4RD2L1V3 This is stupid. I had to root my phone to be able to hide the navbar at any time I want and also to gain better battery management controls and other stuff that I sorely wished Google had added to stock Android way sooner. And I was considering a Netflix subscription. No longer...... Sruly J I know it's not fully a solution which is "worth it", but the app Custom Navigation Bar offers the ability to hide status bar/narbar without root. Although like you said, you had other reasons to root, so... My1 yeah, I do root for theming and stuff, but srsly they literally are throwing oil in the Piracy and DRM discussions with this. Diar I pay for Netflix so I can watch the content any way I want guilt free, whether that's their app or other locations on the Internet. F their VPN blocking and DRM. If they make their app impossible to use, I just won't use it. They'll still get my money but they will lose any data/tracking since I'll still be watching their shows, just outside of their ecosystem. Dummies. ReedSolomon Between the SJW nonsense like Bill Nye, the ipv6 tunnel blocking (rather than simply defaulting to ipv4), increases in price, less and less quality content, and now this, I see little reason to keep paying for Netflix. robogo I understand Netflix' reasons, I really do - they need to protect their property and investment. But I can't really say I understand the way they're doing this. This is a good way to alienate the small percentage of power users who root their devices for various, but perfectly valid and understandable reasons. And no, this will not make me cancel my membership as long as the app works. Cancelling membership is a silly, overblown reaction to what is, in my mind, a minor nuisance. D13H4RD2L1V3 I personally just find it a dumb move. Seems like an easy way out. Dmitri Smirnov > perfectly valid and understandable reasons. And what reason would that be? Preventing people from ripping their content? Doesn't stop them in the slightest, root-detection in circumvented rather easily as well as safety net, we have PokemonGo to thank for that - a lot of people were motivated to crack it and they succeeded. > Cancelling membership is a silly, overblown reaction to what is, in my mind, a minor nuisance. Cancelling membership is valid form of feedback to the company, that trying to tell it's customers that they are not allowed to own their device that they paid their money for, if they want to watch a movie. robogo You misunderstood, it seems. A perfectly valid and understandable reason to root one's device would be, e.g. Xposed framework, theming support, tethering, backing up stuff with Titanium Backup, etc. Please read my comment once again. EowynCarter Well, if and when it stops working on my phone, what will be a major nuisance. robogo Agreed. I'll have to find another way then. But I'll deal with that when the time comes. Manbearpig I member when netflix released there app for Android and they did the same thing. I would just download the app and be good to go. After awhile though I stop rooting I miss it sometimes Cyber_Akuma I warned people when Pokemon GO of all things had a surprise update that silently added SafetyNet that this garbage was going to become more and more common. Mario RUN uses it too, and now Netflix.... soon apps everywhere are going to add SafetyNet and block rooted devices as standard practice. Google has been incredibly hostile towards people who actually want to own or have control over their devices or even their PC Software over the last few years. And over the last year google has been making SafetyNet more and more harsh, now even tripping if your BOOTLOADER is unlocked even if your phone is not rooted. Pokemon GO and Mario RUN were a small crowd, but I hope after Netflix of all things starts using it (and make no mistake, this is just the beginning) that people will finally push back against Google's hostility towards rooted users. EowynCarter Yeah. Or I might seriously consider going the iOS way. Though iOS would pose other problems. (Bye paylib) BillPosters I rooted my Android phone to get rid of the annoying camera shutter sound, and to prevent apps from stealing my contacts, and to basically take control of my device rather than letting Google run the whole show, and because of that I can't update Netflix? Good riddance Netflix. iKon I'm pretty sure you can go in the camera settings and take of the camera shutter sound?.... .. In some region-specific firmware versions or certain devices you can't do that. Railwayman There is a better solution: Declare the device a DRM free zone and use everything else. DRM to me is "Don't Restrict Me!" and an excellent reason to give certain companies the middle finger telling them to just go and F themselves. The most ironic thing here is that removing Netflix or using DRM otherwise doesn't stop piracy. On the contrary - By buying and using DRM content you get to travel in the cargo hold with no heating while the pirating consumer get first class service: more content, no restrictions, no copyright trailers or ads before the movie start and stop on. Even better: They can use whatever apps or ROMs they want. Would I unroot my device in order to get DRM content onboard? No way!!! If Netflix are so scared - block the client on Mac OS X and Windows et al. Piracy doesn't usually happen with an Android device as a source but rather computers and HDCP rippers. Another thing also to the DRM companies: Everything that can be played back can be recorded! (Good old piracy saying) Netflix out, Fusion with Exodus, SALTS and Phoenix in. Kodi with Rapier skin is much nicer than the Netflix client and Trakt integration make this way a much better one than going down the DRM route, sitting with an uprooted stock ROM and Netflix.;) TechJunkie198 ? netflix isn't scared. the studios require the drm. and netflix isn't concerned with the small percent of users who root their devices. Railwayman Doesn't matter. Go and enjoy your DRM services.;) DRM is a pest and that is why the pirating community offer a superior product. It is easier and more hassle free to just put Netflix where they belong and use Exodus et al or MovieBox or Terrarium TV and so on. To those who now consider unrooting because of Netflix: Just don't - use other services instead. Richard Markert So when everybody takes your advice and uses a service that doesn't compensate anybody in the content creation business, and all the high-quality media is gone, don't go crying about there being nothing good to steal anymore, k? Railwayman Even better: DRM and proprietary vendor lock in are scrapped and replaced by standards. If they want some kind of protection - make it device wide and linked to the account signed in so playback works in different apps - only thing needed is to call the system wide authentication system. I am against DRM and vendor restrictions. Original content without any of the BS is what the world need. Piracy is a symptom of several problematic things such as geo restrictions, root restrictions and the failed idea of the "right of no distribution" - i.e. the content exist but stubborn companies deny distribution using silly arguments. I always remove DRM from purchased content in order to have full control including the basic right of using whatever app or equipment for playback. Richard Markert Start developing the solution, and start a content creation company that can compete with the big boys when it comes to quality content. Or, you can sit around and whine online about the content creators not wanting the people who don't follow rules to play in their gated sandbox and get mad when you crawl over the fence. Railwayman I take that you like DRM and proprietary vendor lock-in. It is easy to avoid the gated sandbox so no need to whine. It is easier to just fire up Exodus rather than relocking the bootloader and flashing a stock ROM or remove SuperSU in favor of Magisk just to be able to get Netflix. DRM is such a waste of time. It's not necessary to develop a new service since the content are available DRM free already. Standards for media and books etc does exist or did you miss EPUB, PDF, AAC, MP3, MP4 and so on? Perhaps you prefer such a format as ZNO or Apple modified EPUB that only works with iBooks? saf1927 Magisk seems to do the trick. Helios What about my non-rooted OnePlus One? It's also listed as incompatible.. '-_- 天地人 Don't OnePlus devices run a custom ROM and have unlocked bootloaders? Android Developer How can they block people who root the device from installing the app? The play store doesn't have this filter. Maybe after the install they do this check? Richard Markert If you're really an Android Developer, you would know that SafetyNet is what's doing this "behind the scenes". Android Developer I'm talking about the article. They say that Netflix blocks rooted devices, and I know that this isn't an option on the developer console. Google doesn't have anything related to rooted devices there. Ezio I have about 200 original blu-ray disks, go to cinema, and I'm Netflix subscriber. Now I won't get app updates (or even worse I won't be able to use it in the future) just because I like to use my custom rom. Thank you. This is really a bad move. AdjustedFlow I thought netflix was about providing a better service than piracy. Now they're literally pushing me back to piracy. What the heck? Dany If for "root" they mean administrator privileges, don't we already have that on windows 10? So why Netflix doesn't block desktop version too? P.S. by the way...whatever man! I was using Kodi more than this crap anyway... Miku is Best Vocaloid This means Netflix won't be getting my business anymore. Paul Sterling No worries here, when you're legit. Take my money, I'm not cheap. Give me a service, I'll pay you. I don't need to rob. What am I? 13 living with my mom using Napster? Naw, grew up. Don't have any Tim foil hats. My wallet grew up too. ast00 This is a dick move that could have been avoided. If they want us to pirate their content instead, we will pirate their content. We tried doing it the legal way, but they didn't allow it. Their problem, not ours. EowynCarter Umf. **checks google play ** No longer compatible with my nexus 6 . But nexus 4 still ok. For crying out loud! I'm not rooted or using a custom ROM. Pyramid Power netflix is just losing money. it's saying to those people, 'go to thepiratebay!' RemiV2 I guess I'll just keep torrenting then. Thanks, Netflix. Lawstorant Magisk stan dex 97 new dark web premium links . also included are netfix lifetime membership links as well as graphic Live chat links (use anonymously) https://satoshibox.com/axbr7vnm6ifzk8hwtcreoe28/buy Linus Monie If you are this afraid of someone potentially fiddling around with your code, the problem is not the 'fiddler', it is your code. Netflix is a client app. If I can, with a rooted phone, fake my subscription, or somehow cause a major security issue, that is not a problem with me, that is a problem with you pushing out a vulnerable app to millions of users. Sure, it would be my fault for exploiting it, but there is no-one but you who managed to put the problem in place. A CLIENT app should not be anything but a front-end representation of an API run by your servers. The CLIENT should have nothing but a CLIENT ID to use with the API. The CLIENT should NOT be able to change JACK SHIT with the API, it should only be able to get search results, get access to encrypted streams, etc. If your client CAN change JACK SHIT (which one could assume is true, since you are so actively hiding your code) then you have a major security vulnerability... This is a problem with your code, not anyone's rooted device... Hell, you don't even need a rooted device to access the applications code, just download an APK of the app, extract it, and decompile it... Jesus netflix, get your shit straight you bendy pos... My1 I think their problem is rather that rooted users *might* be able to capture the decrypted stream using root or whatever and they are afraid of that. although on PC you have admin permissions and netflix has no problems iirc. Linus Monie Yeah, exactly, its not like people will prefer to pirate the stream on their phone (at least I wouldn't...), so that was my first thought of why they made this change. Now that I think about it though, its probably not so much of a Netflix decision as it is a licensing issue with one of their "film sources". (can't think of a better word for it rn..) Licensing issues are a bitch when you need to adapt to as many as Netflix has... BahnStormer Netflix is used more on tablets and TV boxes, these tend to be used for several years longer than phones and even Google now only updates their devices for <2 years (Samsung / streamer manufacturer's do this even less!)... We HAVE to run the likes of Lineage if we want the devices to be secure! Bye bye Netflix, even Amazon Video lets us use rooted devices! jcopernicus People don't understand IP and lambast a company protecting it. Of course. My1 I have never tried but if netflix can run over a non-HDCP connection like DVI or VGA, there's literally no reason to use a phone for piracy. RemixedCat well they got rid of 5 star ratings, deleted tons of shows I was in the middle of, and the roku app is hella slow and takes 10 freakin minutes to load (by comparison my OS install from power on to desktop was 8 minutes on my samsung 850 500GB SSD!!) Tobi I'm running LineageOS on my Oneplus One to lengthen the lifespan of my device. Why must I be punished for that? I'm going back to pirating content. StankyChikin Possible that the movie industry is pushing this? SkullOne Shhhhh. Don't use logic here. It's not allowed. It's simply easier to blame Netflix and believe that they have a vendetta against the teeny tiny, itsy bitsy amount of root users out there! StankyChikin Forgive me plz lol username_not_valid This isnt about Netflix, its about its content providers. There is this notion that you can copy files and therefore pirate content if you are rooted. We all know its rubbish, Netflix probably knows its rubbish, but that doesn't change anything. If Netflix wants shows, its has to abide by its license agreements. There is really nothing Netflix, Amazon, Sky or any other streaming service can do about it. The fact that almost all pirate content comes from PCs and HDCP by-pass devices doesnt mean a thing. TedPhillips at least in practice, unlocking your bootloader/being rooted has no impact on your widevine support level. now, i'm not sure if the oem could supply a high-level drm library on a pre-rooted device, due to agreements, but modification after the point of sale is a different matter. meanwhile, keep on streaming netflix on your 'rooted' computer - gasp!~ Richard Markert >meanwhile, keep on streaming netflix on your 'rooted' computer - gasp!~ I don't even need an admin account to steal Netflix on my PC. Since the Windows 10 app and browsers BOTH work over analog, all I need is an inline box with a DSUB VGA connector and simply capture the entire output from the VGA port. My1 or use DVI if possible, even better. Valerie Frye-Preter Did they do this because of the stolen season 5 of Orange is the New Black? TedPhillips wasn't that stolen before it was available for streaming? so i don't see how it could be. TedPhillips when the device can be retroactively uncertified, as safetynet mutates over time, that's a step beyond the usual forced obsolescence of artificially short software support windows. now instead of buying a new phone every 18-24 months, it could be literally whenever they feel like moving the goalposts. Mike Hunt I don't understand. I am a Netflix subscriber, but will probably have to unsubscribe now since I bought a rooted Chinese mediabox for my TV. This sucks, as I liked and supported NetFlix's business model. Richard Markert Which box do you have? Mike Hunt One of these https://www.aliexpress.com/wholesale?catId=0&initiative_id=SB_20170514131212&SearchText=media+box+mini+m8s Brock Reed I'm not even getting the "not compatible" message, it's just not showing up at all. Ajmobileguru First DirecTV Now and now Netflix. I dont see the point. As if rooted users were pirating the streams or movies. Rooted users on non-nexus/pixel devices already were getting only 480p because of widewine crap and now this. Anunnaki This is why people switch to apps like Popcorn Time and Terrarium TV. Biga173rd Popcorn time still works? Anunnaki When I last checked few months ago, it was working. No idea about the current situation though. Biga173rd Okay Erin Andrews Oh that's easy, they block my device I cancel my subscription. Say goodbye to my 15 dollars a month. piggynuts Stopped playing Pokemon, stopped using Snapchat, next to go is Netflix. I refuse to say bye to root. BobButtons Magisk. While some say it's hit and miss with Pokemon GO (idk, I don't play it) it's never not worked for me with Snapchat/Android Pay/Mario Run. cliff_dangers Why does everyone freak out about a rooted phone but my PC which is wide open is not a problem? What makes smartphones so special? Doro Manekia ΝετΦλξ Ανάθεμα σου.Χα χα χα Το Μαααακα. Bewear I am not that upset because I rarely use Netflix on my mobile, I am upset because this kind of blocking will become a trend. BoFiS ugh, fuck you, Netflix, I pay for your serve, LET ME USE IT ON MY PHONE A.M There are some many ways around that LAME NETFLIX - Showbox Kodi Firestick with Kodi I can't see the point of Netflix when we have so MANY better apps out there that kill Netflix ErectBipedal That'll teach them filthy pirates for trying to pay us money!.... wait.... -Netflix probably Zxyon Rhysivz What could users with unlocked/rooted phones do with the Netflix app that other users can't? Loco Mole Netflix content isn't that much better these days, so if they choose to distinguish themselves by being a d*ck to consumers who care about using our devices the way we want to, then f u too, Netflix, I got plenty of other legit streaming content. Fedup Let's see... Piracy: $0.00, no ads, no DRM, no device/location/time restrictions Legit: $$$, ads out the as$, DRM limiting options, shows locked to specific devices, locations, etc. Keep on making the decision easier for us, Netflix. xyz Fortunately, the Pirate Bay is accessible from all devices and regions without any geo-blocking. berserksgangr Well, my Nexus 7 with Lineage it's not working even without root (error 9) Nick Riley This is utterly stupid! Corvus Dove Remember that time that making things more difficult for software and media pirates through DRM while possibly messing with legitimate customers paid off and prevented piracy? Me either. Asbjørn The problem here is that most users root their phone to get the updates that their OEM doesn't want to make available. If Android had proper updates, rooting would not be so necessary. Patel Nisha Root user here. How do I use Magisk for this? I have it installed and new to the Magisk(haven't had a rooted phone in a while)? Keletor Does it stop you from sideloading it? I mean really, if you are rooting your phone you most likely will find a workaround. Luxferro Not yet, but you can be sure the app will stop working in the future. Znuff The download feature is not working for me anymore. And the 5.x app is not working at all, just says I need to install the 4.x one (redirects me to the download page) Tim Get Roku tv or a fire stick cause no issues there and it isn't through Google then Biga173rd People still use Netflix? mlauzon And this is exactly how you piss off your end users! Doug Rogers I guess I'll have to unroot - whoops, Android 4.2 Awesome. Luxferro Don't forget to leave your 1 star review. Links to both apps (Android TV and the normal Android app) https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.netflix.mediaclient&hl=en&rdid=com.netflix.mediaclient https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.netflix.ninja&rdid=com.netflix.ninja Yoda’s Spirit Seems they keep cracking down on anything Open internet related! The only way I can watch overseas now is using Mediahint.com - nothing else works. Luxferro Just use usenet. They are forcing their legit customers to piracy... DDS This move will not stop people from pirating their content, it will encourage it. Exactly the opposite of what they're trying to achieve. But tell that to the a**hats who control the money... Ubelsteiner And thus, Plex and Kodi become even more popular, as Netflix drives a nail into it's own coffin. Znuff http://i.imgur.com/LG3dXc4.jpg http://i.imgur.com/eNeuPCD.jpg Can not use the latest version on my device, it sends me to download the 4.x version. When I try that, the latest 4.x version has Downloads disabled for me (it used to work on this device). US Patriot No worries. I can live without Netflix, but I will NOT live without full control of my devices and data. Ricardo A. Fragoso For those who want root at all cost there's still a chance to get movies with ChromeCast Support... Google "TerrariumTV". :D You are welcome. :D Sir Doogie Houser M.D.Esq. 200 Mobile devices are now a vice.The rules,whether stringent or lenient,if there's demand,the market will fill the demand.Plain and simple.So to Mr.Gable,your wrong buttercup. Nick Coad I can guarantee you that Netflix doesn't make these choices willingly. The production companies they purchase shows off are notoriously backward when it comes to technology and unfortunately Netflix relies on them to survive. Kevin Davis So I can't update my Netflix app on my unaltered Google Store Pixel XL. FUCK YOU NETFLIX, and goodbye, you SONS OF BITCHES.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Mobile 5 HTC U11 features you won’t find on the Galaxy S8 or iPhone 7 Zach Epstein @zacharye May 16th, 2017 at 12:20 PM Share Tweet HTC on Tuesday unveiled its flagship smartphone for 2017, the new HTC U11. HTC’s sleek new smartphone features a design unlike anything we’ve seen from other smartphone makers in recent years. Characterized by what HTC calls “liquid design language,” the U11 features a sleek rounded glass back with color baked on similar to the way pottery is glazed, but on the inside of the glass. The result is a gorgeous effect that catches light and reflects different shades in different directions. Of course, the HTC U11 is more than just a pretty face. In this post, we’ll focus on five key features you won’t find on Samsung’s Galaxy S8 or on Apple’s iPhone 7. Don't Miss: How to protect yourself against WannaCry ransomware Edge Sense I have already seen some people dismiss this new feature as a gimmick. While I cannot state whether or not pressure sensitive devices have a future, I can say that the “squeezable” feature of HTC’s new U11 actually is useful. With Edge Sense, users can configure certain actions to be triggered by a simple squeeze of the phone’s edges. An example is a squeeze on any screen to open the camera, and then another squeeze to capture a selfie. Thinking about the feature in practice, it really does make perfect sense. Your grip is already positioned on the edges of the screen, and applying slight pressure couldn’t be easier. Three AI assistants You know what’s better than Google Assistant, Amazon Alexa, and HTC Companion? Google Assistant, Amazon Alexa, and HTC Companion all on the same device. You can read more about HTC’s implementation and its HTC Companion features in our hands-on HTC U11 preview, but there are a few things that stand out. First, the U11 will be the first widely available smartphone with Alexa hot word support. That means you can say “Hey Alexa” and the U11 will automatically begin listening, just like an Amazon Echo. Second, the U11 also has hot word support for Google Assistant. Say “Hey Alexa” to wake Alexa, or “Ok Google” to wake Google Assistant. The Snapdragon 835 is the first chipset to support two wake word commands, and the U11 is the first phone to take advantage of the feature. 4 mics Ok, so the HTC U11 can support two different hot words. Now that voice-controlled virtual assistants are so popular, how can HTC ensure that the experience is always a good one? HTC’s new U11 has four strategically placed microphones on the device. One mic is always listening for wake words in a low-power stat, and then all four mics are hot when a wake word is spoken. Once the phone determines where the user is positioned in relation to the phone, three mics are disabled and the nearest mic listens to commands. It all happens in an instant behind the scenes, and it should result in the most reliable voice experience we’ve seen on a phone. BoomSound/headphones It’s difficult to describe just how impressive the loudspeakers are on the HTC U11. Suffice it to say there’s no other smartphone on the market we’ve tested that even compares. Last year’s HTC 10 was already impressive when it came to audio playback, but we listened to a demo of the two phones playing the same song, one after the other. Compared to the U11, the HTC 10 sounded like a cheap toy. Sound coming from the U11’s next-generation BoomSound speakers is much louder than any other phone we’ve heard, and it’s fuller as well. You know how quiet and tinny the audio is when you play a video on your phone now? The U11 is basically the exact opposite of that. The phone also ships with very cool new earbuds that include active noise cancellation, but you don’t need to charge them. Instead, they draw power from the U11’s USB-C port. Also nifty are the sonar sensors embedded in the buds, which can sense the shape of the wearer’s ear canal and tune the audio for an optimal experience. Awful sales strategy Sadly, we’ve saved the U11’s worst unique feature for last: Sprint. Of course, there’s nothing wrong with Sprint as a carrier. There is something wrong with launching a new flagship phone as a Sprint exclusive, however. There are always various business factors at play when a smartphone maker releases a new phone as a carrier exclusive, but this deal has disaster written all over it. Sprint is struggling as subscribers continue to flee. HTC is struggling as pressure from much larger rivals like Samsung and Apple increases. Two struggling companies aligning to launch a new flagship phone as an exclusive is not a recipe for success. The HTC U11 is also available unlocked from Amazon and from HTC, but the vast majority of consumers in the US purchase their smartphones from a wireless carrier (or from Apple). This exclusive deal is going to hurt far more than it helps.

Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 4.56pm EDT 16:56 Jaap Stam grins at a Sky microphone. He really speaks very fast, but I did my best: Well, it’s one of the top moments of my career. It’s great to come here, to work with a club with potential, with players who are willing to work very hard to get somewhere. We did it. To get this result today, a win against Fulham, a very good team … we go into the final. When you platy against a team with a lot of qualities, you know you need to be aggressive, but you need to take initiative on the ball yourself, which we’ve shown throughout the season. In the first half we did quite well, second half we started well, scored the goal. After that you want to keep on going, but the other team takes more risks. They controlled the game, and we needed to make some changes. We really needed to dig in and we got that win. Ali Al-Habsi’s been great throughout the season. The players are very happy with him, he’s a player with great reflexes as well, today again a terrific game from him. We knew what we needed to do to get a result against them, to work very hard, and that’s what we’ve done. I don’t care who we play. They’re both very good teams. You can’t say you’re going to win in the final against those teams. They’ve got quality, so they can make it difficult for us but we can make it difficult for them as well.

At this level, it’s really hard to play week in week out, but we showed today, it’s been fantastic. We’ve been fantastic all season at home. That’s why, when we got a draw at Fulham, we knew when we had a job here we’d do it. It would be fantastic to return to the Premier League. I’ve been there, but for the lads it would be great. We said before, we have three cup finals. We did two, and now the big one.

What a win for Reading, but Fulham had enough chances to equalise, and probably to win. A combination of poor finishing, a few fabulous Al-Habsi saves, and Reading’s hard work and defensive numbers denied them.

Fulham are visibly wilting. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 4.32pm EDT 16:32 89 mins: Fulham win a corner, make nothing of it, and it goes out of play for a goal kick. Reading take an absolute age over fetching the ball and getting it to Al-Habsi, and when they do the board goes up, and they take an age over making a substitution. At the end of it all Kermorgant is off, and Joseph Mendes is on.

Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 4.24pm EDT 16:24 81 mins: Fulham absolutely should have equalised by now. However, they haven’t, and the clock is ticking loudly. The more desperate they get, the more players they throw forward. And the more players they throw forward, the more chance there is of a dramatic, decisive counter-attack. This remains great. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 4.22pm EDT 16:22 79 mins: Another good moment for Aluko, who bursts into the box and crosses low to Martin, who attempts a backheel flick into the net, barely makes contact, spins, sees the ball is still next to him, swings his left foot and boots Al-Habsi, who has just dived onto the ball! Reading goalkeeper Ali Al Habsi thwarts Fulham’s Chris Martin.

Aluko does lovely work to get free on the right, he lays the ball back to McDonald, and he absolutely should have scored! Instead, he gives Al-Habsi a third of a chance to save it, and save it he does, tipping over the bar with a flying right fist! Fulham’s Kevin McDonald, centre left, rues a missed chance.

It’s been a fabulously fun game for a neutral. Fulham have a corner on the left, and as its played in four players contrive to attempt to kick it and miss, one after the other.

Report: Google planning to bring its Assistant to the iPhone Google also expected to announce integration of the Assistant into GE appliances. Greg Sterling on May 16, 2017 at 12:24 pm More Google’s developer conference kicks off tomorrow in Mountain View, Calif. One of the expected announcements, according to a Bloomberg report, is the expansion of AI and the Google Assistant to a range of other devices, including the iPhone: At the Google I/O conference this week, the Alphabet Inc. unit plans to bring it to at least three more places: iPhones, coffee tables and kitchens. The Mountain View, California-based company is set to announce a version of its AI-powered assistant for Apple Inc.’s iPhone as soon as Wednesday, according to a person familiar with the matter. The report says that it will be presented as a “free, standalone app” that can be downloaded from the App Store. It’s not clear whether it will be an update of the Google app or a new app called Google Assistant. The report also says that it will integrate with other Google apps installed on users’ iPhones. Google’s Photos app will reportedly also be enhanced with more AI capabilities (it already has the Assistant baked in). Google will also enable the creation of physical “coffee table books” through the app. Perhaps most interesting is the expected integration of the Google Assistant into home appliances made by GE: Google is also integrating its Assistant into GE home appliances such as refrigerators, dishwashers, ovens, washers and dryers. Users will be able to ask the Assistant how many cleaning pods are left in the dishwasher, or tell it to pre-heat the oven to 350F, or ask if the laundry is clean. Samsung is likely to do something similar with its Assistant, Bixby. Bixby may be partly or wholly based on acquisition Viv. The battle for the smart home is well underway. Last week, AI was also front and center at Microsoft’s developer conference. The company said that AI was being integrated into all of its products, from Office to the XBox. If the Bloomberg report is accurate (and I presume it is), the Google Assistant will join Cortana in seeking to lure users away from Siri, Apple’s digital assistant. While Siri has a built-in advantage over rivals, literally, Google Assistant on the iPhone puts additional pressure on Apple to improve Siri’s performance. In a recent Stone Temple Consulting analysis, Google Assistant was found to be the most comprehensive and accurate vs. Alexa, Siri and Cortana.

This could happen as soon as Google’s I/O conference this week, but the exact timing isn’t clear. The report suggests the app would be a blend of the Assistant’s chat functionality – as seen in Google Allo – and the voice features in the main Google app. Of course, this being Apple and all, you won’t be able to set the Assistant as your main voice AI. Instead you’ll likely have to access it from the Google search app, though it’s possible Google will integrate the Assistant into its other iOS apps over time. “We're hunting for awesome startups” Run an early-stage company? We're inviting 250 to exhibit at TNW Conference and pitch on stage! CHECK IT OUT The Assistant was first announced at last year’s I/O, and premiered with Google’s Pixel phones in the fall. Since then it’s spread to a wealth of other Android devices, so the timing for its arrival on iOS now wouldn’t be totally surprising.

Why location marketers need to embrace whimsical, visual storytelling Columnist Adam Dorfman believes that local marketers need to invest in visual storytelling and explains how to use visual assets to create and share location-based information. Adam Dorfman on May 16, 2017 at 10:15 am More Recently, Facebook and Google made announcements that show how important it is for businesses to think visually with their location marketing. On April 10, Google rolled out a better way to do search using images: a “similar items” feature that makes it possible for people to use images to find items that resemble a product that interests them (for instance, you can use a photo of the leather jacket that Vin Diesel wears in “The Fate of the Furious” to find a similar jacket). Meanwhile, Facebook announced that the world’s largest social network is launching a Camera Effects platform to accelerate the uptake of augmented reality. The message is clear: being visual is not only useful, it’s a requirement to compete today and tomorrow. The fact that major publishers such as Facebook and Google are pushing their ecosystem toward a visual future is reason alone for businesses to take a closer look at how they use all forms of visual storytelling to attract and retain customers locally. An equally influential catalyst consists of consumer behavior. Consider some of these compelling signposts: Tweets with images get 150 percent more retweets than tweets without images. Instagram has more than 700 million active users. In 2016, people sent each other 2.3 trillion mobile messages that use emoji. Visual content was expected to account for 74 percent of all internet traffic this year. In response, more brands are treating visual assets as importantly as their written content and data, as well they should. Many brands are getting creative with tried-and-true forms of visual storytelling, such as video. Others are embracing newer forms, such as emoji and GIFs. Still others are pushing the envelope with augmented reality. Here are some examples: Emoji and GIFs Emoji and GIFs are especially useful for connecting with millennial audiences, who are very comfortable using emoji and GIFs to communicate with each other, usually through texts and on social media. Businesses can use emoji to add color and tone to their messages, as an Oakbrook, Illinois, Nordstrom does by sprinkling its Facebook posts with emoji: Emoji also make a business more relevant to platforms such as Instagram that are engineered for visual storytelling. If your business builds customer awareness and retention on Instagram, consider emoji to be a mandatory part of your vocabulary. As restaurant Labriola Bakery Cafe demonstrates, you don’t need to go overboard using emoji — a simple sunburst can work perfectly: Emoji are now becoming a form of commerce. For example, Domino’s famously rolled out a functionality with which people can order pizzas by tweeting an emoji. And Emogi recently launched a platform with which brands can drop sponsored emoji into text messages. Emogi scans the content and sentiment of messages of anonymous users and offers businesses a platform to share branded emoji that correspond to users activities. For instance, if a consumer is texting a friend about going out for lunch, they can use a branded McDonald’s emoji to inject more authenticity into their texts (and, of course, plant the suggestion that they stop by their closest McDonald’s). GIFs, meanwhile, are like mini-stories told within a second or two. By their nature, GIFs can create more engagement and are highly shareable. Starbucks is a GIF leader. The company uses GIFs of cats, dogs, whales, rainbows, starbursts and floating skateboards to convey the energy and fun that comes with the wide variety of flavors that can be had at your local Starbucks — an appropriate form of content sharing for a business that offers Unicorn Frappuccinos. The big trend that I see with GIFs is making them more targeted. A company known as Tenor recently launched a tool that helps companies understand how people associate sentiment with GIFs. With this kind of data, businesses can monitor and adapt the creation of GIFs that more closely match the mood of its audience. Video By now, video has become a visual storytelling mainstay for creating engagement. But video continues to change rapidly. Businesses such as automotive dealers and retailers can and do use longer-form video to share information, such as “how-to” content. Here are some things that really impress me: How location-based businesses have so quickly embraced forms of live video to share information and create engagement with real-time immediacy. For instance, the Mayo Clinic uses Facebook Live to host informative sessions on topics such as pediatric care. And a number of businesses post video snippets on platforms such as Snapchat to give you an inside look at event-based activities, as the annual Chicago Comic & Entertainment Expo did recently by giving Snapchat users a brief tour of the fun going on at the expo. How brands are learning how to distribute video across multiple platforms. Tiffany & Co. recently created awareness for its products across its stores by livestreaming an event that was broadcast across social channels and then edited the content into smaller snackable segments for people who didn’t have time to watch the entire live stream. In doing so, Tiffany created nearly 24 million impressions that will build awareness with consumers in an omnichannel world. To win with video, think real time — and share everywhere. Augmented reality As Facebook believes, augmented reality is the future of visual storytelling — even more so than virtual reality, whose uptake remains hampered by barriers to entry such as cost and equipment requirements. Retailers such as IKEA are using augmented reality to help businesses turn brick-and-mortar locations into more immersive experiences and to help customers visualize the use of products in their home before they visit a brick-and-mortar location. To be sure, augmented reality is still a technology in development — but it’s not going away. What you should do Emoji, GIFs, video and augmented reality represent a small sliver of image-based content options that business are employing. It can be overwhelming for a business to know where to start. I suggest that businesses: Start with their customers. How do they use image-based content to communicate with each other? With you? And how often? As I noted, emoji and GIFs may be especially applicable with millennial audiences. Consider also where in the customer life cycle to use visual storytelling. Emoji and GIFs are great for capturing attention. Video and augmented reality may be more applicable closer to the purchase stage. Match the content with the platform you use. If you’re on Instagram and Snapchat, you’re already using images. But it’s important to keep up on the features that platforms are developing. Instagram and Snapchat are locked in an arms race to develop the most engaging video and image-based features, and Instagram is quickly ramping up sponsored content. Meanwhile, Facebook has established a strong lead in the use of live video. Understand each platform and its strengths. Test and learn constantly. Successful businesses are not coming out of the gate with perfect video content. They’re making their share of mistakes as they test the possibilities of visual content, especially live video. In fact, the imperfect nature of live video creates a certain you-are-there appeal. Don’t wait for the tools to become perfect. Learn along with the tool providers. Whatever you do, get savvy with visual storytelling now. Take another look at your content- and data-creation approaches and figure out how to weave visual assets into how you create and share location-based information. You’ll make your locations more findable and engaging with consumers who live and breathe visual storytelling.

The company best known for its search engine wasn't kidding around: It made hardware the centerpiece of its Google I/O developers conference here and later poached Amazon executive David Foster, who ran the lab responsible for Amazon's Kindle tablet and Echo smart speaker, to head hardware product development. Google CEO Sundar Pichai has referred to hardware as "our next big bet." A year later, Google has discovered that hardware can be, well, hard. As Google gets ready to lay out its vision at this year's I/O Wednesday, it's still making that hardware bet pay off. Pixel phones are in short supply and relatively few have sold. Virtual reality isn't yet ready for prime time, as evidenced by modest sales of Google's Daydream VR headsets. The Home speaker has sold well, but has been dwarfed by Amazon Echo. Foster, the prized recruit brought to kick-start the division, left in April after six months on the job. Hardware is hard because Google's success, in large part, is dependent on others. It's sourcing components, managing inventory and distribution, making supply-chain deals, crafting relationships with cellular carriers, and more. It's also investing plenty of money into marketing, making this a risky financial and operational gambit for Google. Albeit early in Google's grand hardware experiment, the company lags in key markets. Jan Dawson, who runs Jackdaw Research, estimates shipments of 600,000 to 700,000 Pixels in the fourth quarter last year, and probably half that amount in the first quarter of 2017. (Apple, by comparison, shipped 50.8 million iPhones in the first quarter.) Google Home, with 23.8% of the U.S. market for voice-enabled speakers this year, is far behind Amazon Echo's 70.6%, according to eMarketer. Even Daydream shipments — expected to soar from 120,000 last year to 2.23 million in 2017 — would amount to about half the size of market leader Samsung Gear VR's shipments this year, according to IHS Markit.   "Hardware is a tough business and can be quickly commoditized," says Tuong Nguyen, an analyst at market researcher Gartner. "But the end game is not to compete with Samsung and Apple on shipments. It is to show (Google) services through devices." Google does not specifically break out revenue figures for hardware, but Pichai hinted it contributed to a 43% increase in "other revenues" to $3 billion during Alphabet's quarterly financial report last month. The company, when asked to comment, says it's "thrilled" with the reception of its hardware.  "We’re committed to building hardware for the long term as a great way to bring a beautiful, seamless Google experience to people," Google said in an emailed statement. "The early signs are promising, and you can expect to see us expand our offerings thoughtfully." 'Made by Google' One of the most frequently cited quotes in technology is computer scientist Alan Kay’s advice that “people who are really serious about software should make their own hardware." Steve Jobs even referenced Kay when introducing the first iPhone, which tightly weaves Apple software and hardware to control the Apple user's experience end to end. Last year, Google tore that page from Apple's playbook, staking its claim as its own hardware brand with the introduction of the Google Home speaker, the Daydream virtual reality headset, a WiFi router and an updated Chromecast video streaming stick. In October, it unveiled the Google Pixel. This week when Google again gathers thousands of software developers in Mountain View, Calif., it's expected to continue its big push into the hardware business. Google's gambit, with the catchy phrase "Made by Google," creates its own portfolio of consumer devices in the mode of an Apple or Amazon, to ensure consumers always have access to its web services and, hence advertising. The goal is to create "a personal Google for each and every user," Pichai said last year. It's risky on several levels: besides the cost of manufacturing, marketing and customer service, it risks alienating its own Android partners, with which its Pixel phones and other deices now compete.  But even if the Home and Pixel don't fly out the shelves, Google may still count the 'Made by Google' play as a success — if the devices pressure its partners, such as Samsung and LG Electronics, to come out with their own groundbreaking hardware based on Android. And that's the ultimate goal, say analysts:  entice users to stay in the Google ecosystem, a network of services and devices linked by its Google Assistant artificial intelligence. "I  never believed that Google's position in hardware was designed to be a huge revenue maker," says Creative Strategies analyst Tim Bajarin said. "I don't ever see Google as a hardware company. I see them as a company that creates hardware to try to get their OEMs to push the envelope." It is a strategy fixated more on retaining Google's loyal users within its computing ecosystem than overtaking market leaders in various hardware categories, say analysts. "Pixel is more about showcasing Google services on one phone than it is about competing on a large scale with Samsung Galaxy S8 and iPhone," says Holger Mueller, principal analyst at Constellation Research. Some of these loyal users say this plan is working working. "I wanted one from the day it was announced," Clifton Thomas, a 38-year-old graphic designer from Clifton Forge, Va., says of the Google Pixel. Thomas said Google’s own devices were always attractive because they received operating system and security devices before other Android devices. But the Pixel was special because it was expressly built to show off Google's latest services and artificial intelligence, says Thomas, who uses the Chrome browser, Android Auto in his car, and Google Play Music as his streaming service. And the Pixel is his primary camera, too, which he uses to take pictures and video of his 9-month-old daughter. When Sonny Chatrath, director of sales of a travel management company and a Bollywood actor from Freehold, N.J., decided to give up his Gionee S7, a Chinese phone which he bought in India while shooting a film, he almost bought the new Samsung Galaxy S8+, lured by a buy-one-get-one-free promotion. But this self-described "Google guy" says he couldn't resist buying the Pixel instead. He says he wanted to have a phone no else does."I am a fan of everything Google, therefore the choice was not difficult," says Chatrath, who describes himself as a devout Android user.

 TV networks are kicking Facebook and Google while they are down Mike Shields May 16, 2017, 11:55 AM 2,361 facebook linkedin twitter email print andrew craig kyle noke ufc punch knockout The big TV networks have been throwing a lot of punches at Facebook and Google this week. The top broadcast and cable networks are hosting their annual 'upfront' presentations in New York this week, during which they try to convince ad buyers to spend more of their budgets on TV ads. And a recurring theme has been pounding digital advertising, and Facebook and Google in particular, for the medium's recent string of mishaps.  Those include a series of measurement errors by Facebook and a slew of major marketers pulling ads off of YouTube after several top brands found their ads next to hate videos on the site. There's a ton at stake for TV networks, as digital advertising revenue surpassed TV ad spending for the first time last year. And Google and Facebook are taking upwards of 85 cents of every new digital ad dollar hitting the marketplace by some estimates. TV executives have been relishing pointing out some of the screwups. At the ESPN upfront on Tuesday morning, host Kenny Mayne made a crack about social media metrics being made up. That was after a musical group sang about hoping for numbers they can trust. Later, ESPN's senior vice president of sales and marketing Patricia Berton said "there is nothing unpredictable about investing with ESPN," seemingly to imply that digital media companies couldn't promise much in the way of predictability. Wendell Scott, ESPN's senior vice president of multimedia sales, added that the network is able to deliver real ads to "real people." On Monday, some of the major broadcast networks were even harsher. NBCUniversal's Linda Yaccarion, chairman of advertising sales and client partnerships, poked at digital media companies for "grading their own homework" while struggling to provide brands a safe environment. "Television is the most effective ad medium ever," she said. "Our friends in Silicon Valley know it." Meanwhile, at Fox's upfront, Family Guy creator Seth MacFarlane sang about the dangers of advertisers ending up next to ISIS videos on the web. Meanwhile, newly installed sales chief Joe Marchese compared the state of digital media to the subprime mortgage crisis, while calling into question some of the massive audiences self-reported by top social apps. He even mouthed a portion of his presentation without actually saying anything, looking to mock the way that many people watch videos on mobile devices without the sound turned on. Of course, while the TV executives look to exploit a rare moment when digital giants like Facebook and Google are vulnerable, they are off course ignoring the elephant in the room. Live TV viewership continues to freefall, as people watch more video content on their own time, often without ads.

 Google Assistant is coming to Audi, Volvo Laurie Beaver May 16, 2017, 12:46 PM 820 facebook linkedin twitter email print BI Intelligence See Also Amazon's Echo isn't going to give up its lead anytime soon Google and Uber enter India's meal delivery market Microsoft brings IoT to the Edge This story was delivered to BI Intelligence Apps and Platforms Briefing subscribers. To learn more and subscribe, please click here. Google unveiled a new Android OS for automakers on Monday that will feature much deeper integration than its current car OS, Android Auto, according to Bloomberg. The company has partnered with Audi and Volvo to build Android-powered cars from the ground up that will feature Google Assistant natively built in. This will allow users to control things in the car like the temperature of the seats, as well as access popular apps like Google Maps and Spotify using just their voice. The announcement also signposts the company’s long-term efforts to reach every part of a user’s life. This isn’t the first time Android has surfaced in cars. Google launched Android Auto in 2014, allowing users to stream their Android phones on their car’s interface. However, this only allowed users to control their smartphone apps and infotainment system — similarly powered by their phones. The natively built OS will give consumers the ability to control functions within the car using their voice or apps built into the car’s interface. Like rivals Apple and Microsoft, Google is envisioning a future where its AI operates across devices and platforms. This is reliant on two emerging trends:  Voice as a platform. Voice is increasingly being touted as the next primary interface for the connected world. Moreover, voice assistants like the Google Assistant can act as the umbrella interface that connects multiple platforms including handsets, connected cars, and the connected home. The car as a mobile device. The growing inclusion of “mobile” features in cars — such as screen interfaces, apps, and services — is making cars increasingly smartphone-like. It makes sense then that Apple, Microsoft, and Google are doubling down on making their platforms the primary OS. For Audi and Volvo, native integration of Android could set them apart from the competition and make them more appealing to consumers. That’s because smartphones are the dominant point of interaction in most consumers’ lives. More so, infotainment is becoming increasingly reliant on existing smartphone services, like Spotify, something car makers have little experience with. Giving users a smartphone-like experience natively could convince users to choose these brands over others. Google, Audi, and Volvo are expected to further showcase Android OS at this week’s Google I/O annual developer conference, which BI Intelligence will cover closely in the following days. Advancements in a bevy of industries are helping intelligent digital voice assistants like Apple's Siri and Amazon's Alexa become more sophisticated and useful pieces of technology.  Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) are allowing them to accurately understand more information, while upgrades to mobile networks are facilitating quick transfers of data to robust clouds, enabling fast response times. In addition, the swell of internet connected devices like smart thermostats and speakers is giving voice assistants more utility in a connected consumer's life.  Increasingly sophisticated voice assistants and the growing potential use cases they can assist in are driving consumers to adopt them in greater droves — 65% of US smartphone owners were employing voice assistants in 2015, up significantly from 30% just two years prior. Consumers are also eagerly adopting speaker-based voice assistants, with shipments of Google Home and Amazon Echo speakers expected to climb more than threefold to 24.5 million in 2017, according to a report from VoiceLabs. However, there are still numerous barriers that need to be overcome before this product platform will see mass adoption, as both technological challenges and societal hurdles persist.  Jessica Smith, research analyst for BI Intelligence, Business Insider's premium research service, has compiled a detailed report on the voice assistant landscape that explains what's driving the recent upsurge in adoption of digital voice assistants. It explores the recent technology advancements that have catalyzed this growth, while presenting the technological shortcomings preventing voice assistants from hitting their true potential. This report also examines the voice assistant landscape, and discusses the leading voice assistants and the devices through which consumers interact with them. Finally, it identifies the major barriers to mass adoption, and the impact voice assistants could have in numerous industries once they cross that threshold.  Here are some key takeaways from the report: Voice assistants are software programs that respond to voice commands in order to perform a range of tasks. They can find an opening in a consumer’s calendar to schedule an appointment, place an online order for tangible goods, and act as a hands-free facilitator for texting, among many, many other tasks. Technological advances are making voice assistants more capable. These improvements fall into two categories: improvements in AI, specifically natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning; and gains in computing and telecommunications infrastructure, like more powerful smartphones, better cellular networks, and faster cloud computing. Changes in consumer behavior and habits are also leading to greater adoption. Chief among these are increased overall awareness and a higher level of comfort demonstrated by younger consumers. The voice assistant landscape is divided between smartphone- and speaker-based assistants. These distinctions, while important now, will lose relevance in the long run as more assistants can be used on both kinds of devices. The primary players in the space are Apple's Siri, Microsoft's Cortana, Google Assistant, Amazon's Alexa, and Samsung's Viv.  Stakes in the competition for dominance in the voice assistant market are high. As each assistant becomes more interconnected with an ecosystem of devices that it can control, more popular platforms will have a sizable advantage.  In full, the report: Identifies the major changes in technology and user behavior that have created the voice assistant market that exists today.  Presents the major players in today's market and discusses their major weaknesses and strengths.  Explores the impact this nascent market poses to other key digital industries.  Identifies the major hurdles that need to be overcome before intelligent voice assistants will see mass adoption.  Interested in getting the full report?

Businesses are still reeling from the fallout, and government agencies around the world are investigating. Security researchers have documented similarities between the WannaCry code and malware created by Lazarus group, a hacking operation that has been linked to North Korea. The code similarities were discovered by Google researcher Neel Mehta on Monday. Google declined to comment. The security firm Symantec also found links between Lazarus and WannaCry. It discovered early versions of WannaCry on systems that had been compromised by the Lazarus group’s tools. These versions were different than the ransomware that spread on Friday. It is unclear whether the Lazarus group put the ransomware on those systems, or someone else did. “We have not yet been able to confirm the Lazarus tools deployed WannaCry on these systems,” a Symantec spokesperson said in a statement to CNNTech. “While these connections exist, they so far only represent weak connections. We are continuing to investigate for stronger connections.” Kaspersky Lab, a security company, has also published the similarities. The Lazarus group was linked to the 2014 hack of Sony Pictures and attacks on banks around the world.The latest observations are still a long way from determining whether North Korean hackers were behind the recent global cyberattack, but they demonstrate how researchers go about finding who is to blame. One way is to investigate the code and compare it to samples that known hackers have used in the past. According to Amanda Rousseau, malware researcher at security firm Endgame, it’s difficult to catch cybercriminals. Further, it will be hard to find patient zero, or the first victim that kicked off the spread of the virus. The WannaCry ransomware took computers hostage by encrypting their files and requiring payment to unlock them. It leveraged a Windows vulnerability leaked in a trove of hacking tools believed to belong to the NSA. The ransomware mostly affects businesses and large organizations that use a Windows tool that enables file-sharing. Microsoft released a patch for the vulnerability in March. Rousseau says the malware code indicates there are at least two different parties responsible for it because there are two pieces of the attack that are coded differently. The ransomware itself was not hard to reverse engineer, she said, and indicates that a less experienced person wrote it. Multiple government agencies are committed to tracking down the perpetrators. Finding out who is responsible is called “attribution.” And it is very hard to do. Researchers look for certain identifiable pieces of code or clues on how it was executed, such as text strings or site registrations. But there are tools that hackers use to throw investigators off their tracks. Often, malware code is publicly available, or it can be purchased on digital black markets. According to Michael Flossman, researcher at security firm Lookout, examining the victims can help narrow down the perpetrators — but in the case of WannaCry, hundreds of thousands of machines were affected and there weren’t a ton of similarities in who was hit. The hackers responsible have not received much in return for their efforts. While the ransomware took down hospitals and critical infrastructure, it’s made less than $60,000 in ransom. Security researchers and government agencies have advised businesses not to pay the ransom. Researchers are piecing together where WannaCry came from, and some insight into how hackers used the leaked Microsoft vulnerabilities could be found on the dark web. The dark web is like a second layer of the internet beyond what average people use every day. It can only be accessed via the Tor browser, which gives users a cloak of anonymity and makes it impossible for anyone else to see their activity. Cybersecurity firm CYR3CON collects information from dark web sites and uses it to understand cybersecurity threats. In mid-April, the firm identified a conversation on a popular Russian forum that discussed using the leaked NSA exploits to launch ransomware attacks against hospitals. “The thing most interesting was a conversation that mentioned the specific Windows exploit,” Paulo Shakarian, cofounder and CEO of CYR3CON, told CNNTech. “It mentioned there were tens of thousands of systems that could be targeted, and many of them were in the medical industry.” Though there were many dark web conversations around the tools after they were released in April, this specific thread talked about a ransomware attack strikingly similar to WannaCry. It’s impossible to know who posted it, and it is not evidence that people who participated in the thread were responsible. But law enforcement and researchers can use this information to see what future attacks might look like so companies and users can defend themselves against hacks. “It can give insight into what malicious hackers are looking to target, what tools they will use, and what is the established expertise,” Shakarian said.

Show More Pay much attention to headlines, and it'd be easy to fall under the impression that Google had finally found the fix to the age-old problem of Android upgrades. You've seen the news by now, right? Ahead of the I/O developers' conference this week, the gang from Goog announced a new plan to streamline Android upgrades and take some of the pain out of the process. The effort is called Project Treble, and the basic idea is to create a "modular base" for Android that makes it easier for manufacturers to update their devices in a timely manner. Sound like a lot of gobbledygook? Let me break it down: The short version of Treble is that the guts of Android will soon exist in their own standalone layer within your device's storage (starting with new devices launched with Android O in place). The hardware-specific code manufacturers need to make the device run properly, meanwhile, will live in a totally separate layer called the vendor interface. That means when Google has a new Android version ready, your phone's manufacturer can get it ready for your device with less work than what's required now -- because all the stuff in that vendor interface can remain constant instead of having to be manually coded into the operating system every time. Google The old setup (at top) vs. the new (at bottom) -- it's all about separation It's a positive step for the state of Android, to be sure, and on paper seems like a sensible way to help manufacturers speed up their always-underwhelming upgrade delivery habits. Before you break out the bubbly, though, there's some important context to keep in mind -- specifically, two major points: 1. The scope of the changes It's crucial to note that Project Treble appears to be focused exclusively on a phone's "lower-level" software -- the device-specific code "written in large part by the silicon manufacturers," as Google explains it. That means it's likely not designed to account for the higher-level factors like all the user-facing interface changes and feature additions so many manufacturers bake into Android before shipping the software to consumers. I asked Google for clarification. A spokesperson told me only that the vendor interface is designed to "work with" OEM customizations but wasn't yet able to elaborate on what specifically that means. In a discussion on Google+, however, Google Android Framework Engineer Ian Lake noted that Treble "focuses on the level below the OEMs" -- the "silicon manufacturers who do much of the device-specific work" -- and that it "just means that it won't be the silicon manufacturer's fault for a lack of updates." This is consistent with the language used to describe the effort in Google's official blog announcement. So in other words, device-makers may still have to take the time to incorporate their own custom user-facing changes into the Android code before rolling out a new release -- something that'll continue to require a fair amount of effort and resources. And that brings us to the broader point: 2. The manufacturer motivation This is the real "if" upon which the measurable success of this plan hinges: Will Android device-makers actually adjust their behavior as a result of these streamlining efforts? Project Treble may make the act of processing and delivering updates easier, after all, but it'll still require manufacturers to make upgrade delivery a priority if it's going to make any meaningful and wide-reaching difference. And if history's any indication, that type of customer-centric focus isn't necessarily something we can count on from most Android device-makers -- no matter how hard Google may try to make it happen. It's a sobering reminder, I realize, but it's critical to keep in mind as we hear all the oohing and ahhing over this over the coming days. Remember, Google has taken steps to encourage timely Android updates and to make the process easier for manufacturers before -- and as we've been reminded time and time again, most of the manufacturers still don't give a damn. Case in point: With Android L in 2014, Google started providing an early preview release of major Android releases so device-makers could have more time with the software ahead of its actual launch. With Android M in 2015, Google offered that preview even earlier in the year to provide even more time. And with Android N in 2016, Google made the preview available earlier yet so manufacturers would have it in hand in March and with an additional 36 days before its debut. Despite all of that, upgrades have continued to be an afterthought for most manufacturers -- worse than ever across the board with the current Android N release, in fact, as I observed in my data-driven Android Upgrade Report Card. From my painful post-mortem: The underlying problem with Android upgrades isn't anything technical. It's the fact that the companies making and selling Android phones have no real motivation to care about high-quality post-sales support and to make timely, ongoing upgrades a priority. Stop and think about that for a minute in relation to this current Project Treble news. Sure, manufacturers might have less work to do when it comes to updating their Android devices with Treble in place -- but regardless of the specifics, they'll still have some resource-requiring work in front of them. And nothing about their underlying priorities seems to have shifted. The real rub, as I observed earlier this year: The business model tells you everything: Google's overarching goal with a Nexus or Pixel device is to provide a spectacular ongoing user experience -- a goal that, understandably, no other company hawking hardware fully shares. Google alone stands to gain by making your phone optimally pleasant for as long as is financially or technically feasible. ... A company like Samsung, in contrast, stands to gain from a different kind of upgrade -- specifically, from convincing you to upgrade your hardware as often as possible. Providing fast and frequent OS updates not only doesn't help to achieve that goal; in a way, it works directly against it. Plain and simple, all signs suggest the lackluster update performance we're seeing from Android manufacturers is less about logistics and more about incentive. And admirable as Project Treble effort is in concept and in engineering, it -- much like the various update-improving efforts before it -- doesn't appear to address that underlying issue. What Project Treble could do is help in situations where chip compatibility is the sole reason for a device being abandoned -- something we've seen plenty over the years, as an investigation over at Ars Technica uncovered. It could also help cut costs and further improve update delivery times for devices where the manufacturers are already motivated, like with phones made by Google and even (at least sometimes) HTC. When it comes to convincing the companies that clearly don't give two shakes about timely post-sales support, though -- well, time will tell. Before you get too optimistic, just remember how many other well-intentioned efforts have slipped through their hands without inspiring improvement.  The good news is that if timely ongoing upgrades are important to you, there is an answer out there already. But while Project Treble is undoubtedly a positive step for Android, it's tough to imagine it being an end-all fix for companies that just don't care.

Sometimes I'll be watching a video where no one says anything remotely similar to those phrases, and the lights on my Home flip on. But I have noticed that most of the time, the lights turn off a split-second later, as the Home actually realizes that no one called for it (presumably once the voice clip is processed by Google's servers). Amazon appears to be giving Alexa a similar ability, with the introduction of 'Cloud-based wake word verification.' Essentially, any device with Alexa already listens for a wake word with the Wake Word Engine (WWE). But now, an additional cloud-based check verifies the phrase. If the second check thinks it was an accidental trigger, it will tell the device to close the audio stream and turn off the voice indicator. Manufacturers will have to update their Alexa-equipped devices to use the new verification, but Amazon has tried to make the process as painless as possible. The new Ecobee4 smart themostat is the first generally-available product using this new feature.

Basically everyone goes "Alexa....pauses for a second" then speaks. It's always listening for the wake word, so you can just rip off a continuous normal speed request all at once. So like "OK Google what's the weather like" with zero pause. Just say the request without any delay at all, even very fast. It'll catch it. I dunno, peeve of mine I guess.

Computing Phones Cars Gaming Science Extreme Deep Dives Deals About ExtremeTech ET Forums Contact ExtremeTech Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ziff Davis Home Computing What Is Mixed Reality, and Can It Take Augmented Reality Mainstream? What Is Mixed Reality, and Can It Take Augmented Reality Mainstream? By David Cardinal on May 16, 2017 at 11:45 am Comment The term “mixed reality” has been thrown about a lot as of late, but pinning down a precise definition has proven elusive. After spending the day at Stanford University’s SCIEN-hosted workshop, which was full of augmented reality (AR) and mixed reality (MR) luminaries, it appears the one thing everyone can agree on is there isn’t a standard definition for either term. Let’s see if we can do a bit better. AR now covers a broad spectrum, from Instagram Stickers and Pokemon Go, to sophisticated onsite walkthroughs of rooms of virtual furnishings. Technically, MR covers that, plus virtualized surroundings as context for physical objects–for example, visiting an appliance showroom and seeing an oven nestled in a model of your kitchen. For now, though, high-end AR companies have adopted MR as a marketing buzzword to describe Head Mounted Displays (HMDs), which present an integrated view of digital content and the real world as seen through the mostly transparent goggles. Loosely speaking, they are using MR to mean incorporating the best bits of both AR and VR in a single device. After a day of talks and demos, it’s clear they’re still short of that goal. Augmented Reality already has traction for vertical applications In the marketplace, AR is almost certainly already bigger than VR. It has dozens of uses in industry, some of which we covered at Augmented World Expo. There were well over 100 exhibitors with commercial and industrial applications already in the marketplace, as well as several high-end military products, and even many vendors providing infrastructure support for AR rollouts. We’ll be back at AWE this year and let you know how things have progressed. Just like VR, though, AR and MR have had a hard time getting traction outside of niche markets, and the staggering but unique success of Pokemon Go. As far as AR-friendly hardware, the best known devices are based on Google’s Project Tango. Google only made it available to developers, but Lenovo has packaged it in a consumer phone–the Phab2 Pro. Unfortunately, it’s bulky and not an especially great phone, so it hasn’t taken the world by storm. Asus has announced an impressive new model, the Zenphone AR, which supports both Project Tango for AR and Google’s Daydream for VR. It has impressive specs, but no price yet. If it is a great phone, it should be a better test of how popular Tango’s AR features — like building a 3D model of any space you walk through — are with consumers. Introducing mixed reality At the extreme, MR builds on AR by adding elements of Virtual Reality (VR), as exemplified by Microsoft’s HoloLens demo of a NASA simulation of walking on the surface of Mars. Microsoft uses the term MR to imply a mash up of the best of AR and VR, which of course makes the HoloLens one of the leading products in the space. But MR is definitely catching on with a large number of players in AR and VR. Even Oculus, best known for its VR headsets, had two speakers at the workshop talking about its work in AR and MR. Reality roadmap according to Intel, which prefers Merged Reality to Mixed Reality Where mixed reality falls short Mixed reality demos shown on a big screen in front of a roomful of eager conference participants, like those at the SCIEN-hosted workshop at Stanford, are amazing. For example, the Mars experience for the HoloLens makes it look like you are practically in the Star Trek Holodeck. Similarly, watching Meta’s CEO Meron Gribetz throw windows around with his hands like the conductor of a symphony orchestra is compelling. When you actually put on a HoloLens, however, you realize the field of view is tiny. You need to keep moving your head around to see any of the augmented or virtual effects. It is a definite stretch to imagine yourself transported anywhere, like you can with some of the best pure VR demos. Likewise, the actual hands-on demos of Meta we were given were simply a poor rehash of the typical VR demos of looking inside a car or spinning a globe. There was no integration with anything in the real world. Meta is promising to formally unveil its spatial user interface demo at AWE at the end of this month, so we’ll soon know if that’s a major step forward. Magic Leap has already been heavily criticized for over-hyping its efforts using demo videos created with special effects. I also got a quick demo of Intel’s Alloy platform, that relies heavily on its RealSense technology for tracking, but it was actually a pure VR demo, so I don’t know how well they have solved the problem of linking real and virtual objects. What it will take for mixed reality to move beyond niche applications A large part of the Stanford workshop was spent agonizing over where the MR industry needs to go from here. At a minimum, several inter-related technical challenges need to be solved. The first is device Field of View (FOV). It needs to be competitive with VR, at something over 100 degrees. Unfortunately, that requires more power and more bandwidth, which is at odds with the second problem, which is tethering. So far, large FOV devices all need to be tethered to a high-powered computer. Third is alignment with, and tracking of, the real world surroundings. Without this, AR and MR wind up looking like parlor tricks or a watered down version of VR. Perhaps most importantly, as we heard from Google’s Johnny Lee, is the need for inventing new kinds of storytelling that can leverage the strengths of AR and MR. His own Project Tango is a good example. There are one or two impressive applications–mostly creating a model of a home for realtors, and visualizing how furniture will fit in your home or apartment–but they haven’t been enough to get consumers to want Tango enough to buy a different phone. Lee, and some of the other speakers, openly wondered how the AR/MR industry would sustain the investment levels needed to solve all the technical challenges without additional mainstream acceptance of the technologies. For now, that isn’t a problem, as billions of dollars are being poured into R&D in the area. As with VR, though, it looks like we are some years away from truly broad adoption of either augmented or mixed reality products.

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Hangouts to replace Google Talk in chat within Docs, Sheets, Slides By Ida Torres - May 16, 2017 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter When Google announced a few months ago that they were shutting down Google Talk, no one was really surprised and no one actually panicked because there were a lot of other chatting alternatives, even within the whole Google eco-system. We’re still not sure what they eventually plan to do with Hangouts (given the existence of Allo and Duo) but for now, it seems it will be taking on the chat role within your Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides. You always need to have a way to chat with your teammates when you’re collaborating on something and having that chat within Docs, Sheets, and Slides is pretty convenient. You didn’t even have to leave or switch to another app/service since it’s within the app already. But even though Talk will be officially shut down by end of June, you will now have the Hangouts service within the aforementioned apps. But when you will see that happen depends on where your G Suites is at. Those who are on the Rapid Release Track will have Hangouts already available in the Docs Editors by June 7. But those on the Scheduled Release Track will only have the new chat enabled in their Google Drive files by June 21. If you have Hangouts enabled already but disabled Talk previously, you will not be able to use the chat function until after June 7 or 21 (depending on release track). You will not receive any in-app notification that it’s already available for you. You will just see a chat button in Docs, Sheets, and Slides if any of your teammates are viewing or editing the document. Wait for further Google announcements as they continue to refine this transition.

Now, comes the next big test: getting regular civilians comfortable passing the wheel to a machine. This month, Waymo, the mobility division created by Google parent Alphabet Inc., is starting a free, experimental service that will ferry people around Phoenix, Arizona. In preparation, Waymo has added a new suite of hardware and interior designs to its cars, revealed here for the first time, that will help the vehicles see their surroundings better and transmit that information to their occupants. The project’s technology chief Dmitri Dolgov says the upgrades will ease passengers’ concerns. This is no small matter. While driverless cars have demonstrated a remarkable ability to navigate a complex world, every hiccup makes news. Google vehicles have been involved in several fender benders, and a Tesla Model S operating in Autopilot mode crashed into a semi-trailer, killing the owner. The test will be watched closely by the tech and auto industries; a sour experience could turn off consumers, many of whom are skeptical of autonomous vehicles. “They don’t trust that the technology is going to work one hundred percent of the time,” says Kathy Rizk, director of Global Automotive Consulting at J.D. Power, which has conducted surveys showing that while consumers are enthusiastic about driverless cars, they remain wary. “How do you put your trust in something that’s going to take over the entire vehicle?” Waymo originally planned to study human-robot interactions with its own concept car—a round, pint-sized vehicle codenamed Firefly that maxed out at 25 miles per hour and lacked a steering wheel and pedals. But California regulators insisted that the test vehicles must include controls so a human could take over. Waymo has since cut a deal with Fiat Chrysler to use tricked-out Pacifica minivans with all the usual controls that are now cruising around Phoenix. Waymo employees will keep watch in the driver’s seat during the test. Waymo believes regulators will eventually greenlight fully autonomous cars without the means for a human to take control. As a result, it may be necessary for the car to tell passengers what it’s doing (suddenly slowing down, say) and explaining why (because a dog ran into the street). “How do people control the car? How do they tell the car where they want to go?” Dolgov asks rhetorically. “Some of those more subtle things—explaining those to the user, to the customer, to the passenger–is what we’ve been working on.” Waymo has recruited several managers who worked on user design with popular Google products like Chrome and Android. This month, the company also hired a “user experience” researcher, who is supposed to help make passengers’ time in the cars “intuitive, accessible, fun—and even magical.” In a mockup viewed by Bloomberg, a special dashboard displayed nearby cars, pedestrians and buildings-an effort to give people confidence that the car is competent and in control. Some nearby cars were lit up, if they were relevant to the situation. Others were shown less prominently. The message: Don’t worry, the system sees the cars and understands which ones to track. Knowing buildings are there isn’t critical, but showing them in outline helps orient passengers in the world. And when the vehicle yields to make a turn at a green light, the words “waiting for intersection to clear” appear. (The company stresses the design isn’t final.) Beyond keeping passengers feeling safe, there are practical issues. Because passengers will enter via the rear doors, Waymo’s self-driving system brings the vehicles to a stop several feet forward from where traditional cars would pull up. Since Waymo was spun out of Alphabet’s X lab in December, it has thrown resources and talent at the hardware underpinning its autonomous vehicles. The division has hired aggressively, including several engineers from Terra Bella, the satellite division Google sold earlier this year, according to a person familiar with the situation. Waymo has also hired a number of reliability engineers from Tesla, a Waymo spokesman confirmed. Earlier this year, the division unveiled a new suite of the sensors and chips that make autonomous cars possible. Not only are they cheaper, they also can generate a 360-degree view around the vehicle and see pedestrians and cars at far longer ranges. Newer cameras help the cars better navigate rain, a persistent challenge. Tiny wipers added to the spinning lidar atop the roof help mitigate a surprisingly routine problem: bird droppings. The new sensors can now see other vehicles and objects up to 200 yards away, Dolgov says. Among the thorniest challenges are so-called edge cases, unusual situations that must be mastered by the technology, such as anticipating the sometimes unpredictable actions of human drivers. Waymo’s latest hardware and software do a better job of figuring out how quickly cars are merging into freeway traffic, anticipating when someone is about to pull a U-Turn and navigating unprotected left turns—a particularly tricky maneuver because the car must figure out whether it has time to turn before oncoming traffic reaches the intersection. Dolgov says these advances give him confidence Waymo is ready to ferry around people who don’t work for Alphabet. So bullish is Waymo that it deliberately chose a depot in Phoenix that forces its minivans to turn left into oncoming traffic. Still, Dolgov knows better than to be overconfident. The company held a very limited trial of its vehicles in Phoenix for two months and quickly found itself grappling with dust storms. “We’re in the learning phase,” he says. Waymo may have a new avenue to expand road tests beyond Phoenix: the company cut a deal with Lyft Inc., which operates its ride-hailing service in at least 300 U.S. cities. Google has a history of rosy forecasts for fully self-driving cars, which some analysts say are still decades away. The company is also known for designing products with little idea of how they’ll be received. Some became huge successes (gmail); others didn’t (Google Glass). Waymo is acutely aware of this history, which may explain why it has taken so long to get a driverless service up and running. Competitive pressure may have forced its hand. Uber Technologies Inc., locked in a court battle over allegations its stole Waymo technology, has started its own self-driving tests in several cities. Tesla Inc. is aggressively expanding the Autopilot feature across its model lineup. And, of course, major automakers are all hard at work on their own robot cars. Waymo may have an edge over the traditional car companies. In J.D. Power focus groups, people said they believed tech firms—including Tesla—are more capable of perfecting the technology. Still, persuading people to actually get in one of these vehicles with no human fallback will take some effort. “The reality is that the technology will be safer,” says Chris Rockwell, the founder of user research firm Lextant. “That doesn’t necessarily get the passengers on board.” Copyright 2017 Associated Press.

On Monday, Clinton revealed her plans for Onward Together, a new nonprofit that seeks to provide more financial ammunition to Democratic candidates and causes. Among the first organizations she plans to back is Color of Change, a liberal-leaning civil rights outfit that has consistently challenged the likes of Google, Microsoft and Uber on everything from their hiring practices to their work with President Donald Trump. In a tweet Monday, Clinton said her efforts through Onward Together are meant to “encourage people to get involved” out of a belief that “citizen engagement is vital to our democracy.” She praised Color of Change in particular because of its track record in “organizing for criminal justice reform, voter freedom, fairness and accuracy in media, and other racial justice issues.” Related Hillary Rodham Clinton is coming to Code But Color of Change has done much more than that: Last summer, for example, it launched a national campaign against Microsoft, Google and others, hoping to force them to abandon the Republican convention that officially nominated Trump as the party’s presidential candidate. More recently, it has targeted Eventbrite for allowing so-called alt-right leaders, like Richard Spencer, to sell “tickets to events hosted by hate groups.” Going forward, the group’s leader, Rashad Robinson, told Recode he doesn’t plan to lessen his tough scrutiny — and fierce criticism — of the tech industry. “We’ve had a lot of campaigns in the recent year, everything from corporates sponsoring the [Republican] convention to Uber being on the Trump business council, and those type of campaigns will continue,” he said. “We believe it’s important that companies that are saying they want to take us into the future do not have business practices that take us into the past.” For now, Robinson said his group has not received a check from Clinton’s new nonprofit, which previously said it plans to donate to the causes its supports. (Nor, he stressed, has Color of Change asked for cash.) In fact, Robinson said, his team only learned yesterday morning — hours before her tweet — that she supported their organization. Clinton’s praise is nonetheless striking, however, given her own presidential campaign, which devoted considerable time and effort to courting major tech donors. By Election Day, Clinton had raked in more than $6.2 million from internet-related companies, executives and outside groups, according to data compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics. A spokesman for Clinton’s Onward Together did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Tuesday. It is unclear if the nonprofit, which is not required to disclose its donors, has raised any money from those same tech titans. Trump, by contrast, fared far worse with the industry. He raised about $57,000 from internet-related donors, the Center’s data show. Ultimately, his gap in support appeared to be the result of his rhetoric: Often, Trump criticized the leaders of Amazon, Apple and others, and to many in the tech sector, his comments about immigrants, women and other minorities proved to be anathema. To that end, liberal groups like Color of Change spent much of 2016 targeting companies — including tech giants — that sought to boost the Republican candidate’s prospects. The group sent letters and petitions to the likes of AT&T, Adobe, Cisco and Microsoft, for example, urging them to withdraw any planned financial or technical support for the Republican presidential nominating event, held in Cleveland. At Google headquarters, Color of Change also led a small protest — and dispatched a plane to fly a banner above the company — in an attempt to pressure the search giant to #dumpTrump. Ultimately, some of those companies — like Amazon, Google and Microsoft — aided the convention anyway. But the early efforts by Color of Change and its allies helped galvanize opposition to Trump in the liberal-leaning Bay Area, which has continued protesting his presidency — and the tech executives who work with the White House — in the months since the election. This year, Color of Change has cast a wide net. The group targeted Uber CEO Travis Kalanick, for one, after he initially agreed to aid Trump as part of his business advisory council. Kalanick ultimately withdrew from the board before its first meeting, citing the outpouring of opposition from his own employees. Color of Change took similar aim at Elon Musk, the leader of SpaceX and Tesla, in a petition alongside other liberal groups, though Musk remains a regular if informal adviser to Trump. Uber found itself once again in Color of Change’s crosshairs this March, after it released its first-ever diversity report. At the time, the activist group blasted the company’s “workplace culture and business practices” for being “clearly unacceptable.” Before that, Robinson had spent years trying to force Airbnb to make similar changes to its business practices, citing reports of racial discrimination on the home-sharing site. In the day after Clinton’s announcement, Robinson said the group has noticed a “surge in social media and web traffic.” He said, though, even with the help of Onward Together, Color of Change itself would not change. “They have to invest in the mission,” he said, “and our mission continues.” Subscribe to the Recode newsletter Sign up for our Recode Daily newsletter to get the top tech and business news stories delivered to your inbox.

TECH Can Microsoft's Invoke Compete with Amazon Echo? Credit: Microsoft by Dylan Love This week Microsoft entered an extremely specific market, already thoroughly dominated by Google and Amazon, with Invoke, its internet-connected speaker powered by Cortana, the company’s voice-activated personal assistant software. Users can verbally cue the device to issue future reminders, change the music, control smart-home devices, and answer questions. (For example, Cortana’s answer to “Who’s your daddy?” is “Technically speaking, that’d be Bill Gates. No big deal.”) This makes Invoke’s functionality effectively identical to that of Google Home and the Amazon family of Echo devices. Even its physical resemblance to the Amazon Echo is striking. The only new thing on display here is the ability to make Skype calls, but we can expect to see this functionality become ubiquitous in the future. There’s simply nothing innovative in this me-too device. ALSO: The Age of Alexa Is Upon Us Data says the smart-speaker market will grow by nearly 130 percent this year, so Microsoft is wise to take notice. But the projections aren’t flattering: Amazon dominates with 70.6 percent of total market share, Google follows with 23.8 percent, and Microsoft is one of several making up the remaining 5.6 percent.  There are two reasons that Microsoft would bother with such a seemingly doomed cause. First is that it may be able to successfully market a Cortana-powered speaker to the 145 million users who already habitually interact with Cortana via desktop, inside of Windows. If it can win enough of these users, that may lend momentum to more widespread adoption by others. The second reason is a little more basic: Microsoft wants to assert itself on the consumer homefront after getting shut out of consumer smartphones; Windows Phone was acknowledged as a “failure” by none other than Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, and the next most meaningful territory the company can grab is our homes. Regardless, the seas ahead are unsteady for the Invoke. Its release announcement comes years after the market was born, and the product won’t even be available for purchase until this fall.

Tech Search Search UnitedHealthJustice Department Sues UnitedHealth Again Over $1 Billion in Alleged False Claims Social MediaThe 5 Social Media Habits That Turn Off Recruiters the Most Donald TrumpReporters Committee for Freedom of the Press: ‘No President Gets to Jail Journalists’ Entrepreneurs6 Ways to Stop From Nodding Off at Work PointCloud Google and Amazon Spar Over Big SAP Customers Barb Darrow May 16, 2017 A huge number of Fortune 500 companies handle their most important jobs—things like tracking inventory, handling finance, ordering products, and managing their manufacturing jobs—using SAP (sap) software. That's why the big public cloud vendors—Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform, and Microsoft Azure—want to run SAP's software in their respective cloud data centers. The thinking is if they can run SAP software optimally, they'll win more corporate accounts to their own cloud infrastructure. For businesses that don't want to invest more in running their own data centers, that can be an attractive proposition. Toward that end, Microsoft Azure and AWS have supported some SAP business software for years, with Google joining the fray earlier this year. And now, on Tuesday, SAP said it was making its own SAP Cloud—which it sells as a modern way for corporate developers to build and distribute custom software—will run on all three of those public clouds using Cloud Foundry technology, which offers cross-cloud capability, as its vehicle. Related: Google Woos Enterprise Customers The news comes out of SAP's Sapphire tech conference in Orlando, which kicked off Tuesday. But the flood of SAP-related cloud news started Monday when Amazon (amzn) said users can now run larger SAP HANA databases on its cloud computers. Within 24 hours, Diane Greene, the executive vice president in charge of the Google (googl) Cloud Platform push, was on stage at Sapphire talking about more SAP products, including its Netweaver software development tools and running on the Google Cloud Platform. Related: Welcome to the Great Data Center Convergence All the big cloud players "are duking it out" for SAP business, said Constellation Research analyst Holger Mueller. IBM (ibm), another cloud contender, was actually first to support SAP, he added, remarking SAP is making sure that all of them get a piece of the action. Get Data Sheet, Fortune’s daily tech newsletter. That makes sense because while SAP actually does compete with some Microsoft and AWS products, it's biggest immediate rival is Oracle (orcl), which competes head-to-head with SAP in financial services, human resources, and manufacturing software used by big companies. Oracle is also pitching its own Oracle public cloud as a competitor to AWS, Microsoft, and Google.

Google’s new IoT Core service helps businesses manage their IoT data and devices Posted 15 hours ago by Ron Miller (@ron_miller) 0 SHARES Next Story Houzeo simplifies the process of selling your home Google Cloud launched a new Internet of Things management service today called Google Cloud IoT Core that provides a way for companies to manage IoT devices and process data being generated by those devices. A transportation or logistics firm, for example, could use this service to collect data from its vehicles and combine it with other information like weather, traffic and demand to place the right vehicles at the right place at the right time. By making this into a service, Google is not only keeping up with AWS and Microsoft, which have similar services, it is tapping into a fast-growing market. In fact, a Google Cloud spokesperson said the genesis of this service wasn’t so much about keeping up with its competitors — although that’s clearly part of it — it was about providing a service its cloud customers were increasingly demanding. That’s because more and more companies are dealing with tons of data coming from devices large and small, whether a car or truck or tiny sensors sitting on an MRI machine or a machine on a manufacturer’s shop floor. Just validating the devices, then collecting the data they are generating is a huge undertaking for companies. Google Cloud IoT Core is supposed to help deal with all of that by removing a level of complexity associated with managing all of these devices and data. By packaging this as a service, Google is trying to do a lot of the heavy lifting for customers, providing them with the infrastructure and services they need to manage the data, using Google’s software services like Google Cloud Dataflow, Google BigQuery, and Google Cloud Machine Learning Engine. Customers can work with third-party partners like ARM, Intel and Sierra Wireless for their IoT hardware and Helium, Losant or Tellmeplus for building their applications. Photo: Google Cloud   While the company bills itself as the more open alternative to competitors like AWS and Microsoft Azure, this IoT service is consistent with Google’s overall strategy to let customers use both its core cloud services and whatever other services they choose to bring to the process, whether they are from Google itself or from a third party. Related Articles Microsoft launches new IoT services for the enterprise Amazon Launches AWS IoT -- A Platform For Building, Managing And Analyzing The Internet Of Things Google in the cloud A year after Jasper acquisition Cisco expands the platform The solution consists of two main pieces. First there is a device manager for registering each of the “things” from which you will be collecting data. This can be done manually through a console or programmatically to register the devices in a more automated fashion, which is more likely in scenarios involving thousands or even tens of thousands of devices. As Google describes it, the device manager establishes the identity of a device and provides a mechanism for authenticating it as it connects to the cloud, while maintaining a configuration for each device that helps the Google Cloud service recognize it. The second piece is a “protocol bridge,” which provides a way to communicate using standard protocols between the “things” and the Google Cloud service. It includes native support for secure connection over MQTT, an industry-standard IoT protocol, according to the company. Once the device is registered and the data is moved across the protocol bridge, it can flow through processing and eventually visualization or use in an application.

Google I/O, the company's annual developers conference and biggest event of the year, is usually an Android event where we get a look at the latest features for the smartphone operating system. But when I/O kicks off this Wednesday, expect Google's latest artificial intelligence efforts to be what everyone ends up talking about. If you've been paying attention over the last year or so, you've noticed that Google seems especially passionate about AI, injecting it into everything from search results to chat apps to the new Google Assistant for Android phones and the Google Home speaker. CEO Sundar Pichai has sounded especially bullish on the prospects for AI on recent company earnings calls and public interviews. That was just the beginning. Internally, Google sees AI as its next major platform after search and Android — and it wants to give developers a way to get in early. Here's a quick preview of what to expect from Google during the opening keynote at I/O. The event kicks off Wednesday at 10 a.m. Pacific. Building for AI Google Home Speaker Hollis Johnson/Business Insider At last year's I/O, we got our first look at Google Assistant in the Allo messaging app and Google Home speaker. Now that Assistant has had time to mature and grow into other devices like the new Galaxy S8, expect Google to talk about how developers can build for the platform. This is very similar to the third-party "skills" that are part of Amazon Alexa that let you do everything from play games to order a pizza from Domino's. Google's ambition is to build an entire platform based on AI and voice control, and Wednesday's speech will be all about getting developers excited about the prospect. Google is also expected to announce that its Assistant will be coming to the iPhone and other third-party appliances like GE home appliances, Bloomberg reported Tuesday. The stakes are pretty big. Amazon already has a big head start with Alexa, and the digital assistant is already showing up in a bunch of third-party devices like thermostats and even cars. It also has thousands of third-party skills. Microsoft is also working on expanding its Cortana assistant, and announced connected speakers from Harman Kardon and HP coming later this year. But to borrow Pichai's favorite phrase, it's still "early days" for the category, and everyone is still trying to figure out the best way to grow their respective AI platforms and eventually turn them into real businesses. For Amazon, it's a bit easier since Alexa encourages you to buy more stuff from the company's massive online store. Google and the others will have to figure out how to stuff ads into screenless devices in a non-intrusive way. Expect to see a clearer look at that vision during the keynote. Android Android robot figurine Lucas Zallio Don't think Google forgot about Android though. Although the company gave an early look at the next version (called Android O for now), it mostly focused on developer-friendly features. We'll probably get a better looking at the user-facing features Wednesday. Android O will likely debut this fall with the sequel to Google's Pixel phone. We might also see an update on Google's mission to let Chromebooks run Android apps, turning them into full PCs. But the early models of these Chromebooks are littered with bugs, and develops haven't modified their apps for a laptop-sized screen yet. There's still a lot of work to be done. Cars No, we're not talking self-driving cars, but cars running Android for their infotainment systems and other controls. On Monday, Google announced that Audi and Volvo will make cars that run on Android so you can run apps like Maps and Google Play Music without plugging your phone into car like you have to do with Android Auto or Apple's CarPlay. It also features Google Assistant so you can ask the car for directions or give commands while driving. Finally, it can control basic functions like the air conditioning and seat positioning. Expect to see some demos at I/O this week. Virtual reality and augmented reality A Daydream VR headset Hollis Johnson/Business Insider Google's VR platform Daydream debuted at last year's I/O, and has since launched on the Google Pixel and a few other devices. The company also bought VR gaming studio Owlchemy Labs, a sign that it wants to start building more VR content in house. Expect an update on how Daydream is going. Other stuff Since Google I/O is a developers conference, there will be a lot of wonky developer talk on top of all the flashy consumer stuff. We won't bore you with that. You can also expect some updates on Google's chat apps Allo and Duo, Instant Apps (which let you "stream" a snippet of an app when you click a related link in search), and maybe a demo from one of Google's sister companies like Nest or Verily. Flops Google has a long history of announcing stuff at I/O that either fail or the company never follows through on. Google TV. Google Glass. The Nexus Q. The list goes on and on. If you see something from Google on Wednesday that looks too good to be true, it just might be. Get the latest Google stock price here. This article was originally published on Business Insider.

By Larry Dignan | May 16, 2017 -- 16:00 GMT (09:00 PDT) | Topic: Internet of Things NXP said that it has developed modules with Google's Android Things platform that can speed up the concept-to-product cadence and add intelligence to multiple devices in the smart home. The upshot here is that by the holiday shopping season more devices will be able to replicate commands used by Google Home and Amazon's Echo. And that may mean a lot less integration since more home devices, think ceiling fans, will be able to process voice commands on their own. CNET Smart Home Guide From connected light bulbs, to plant sensors, to smart locks, and beyond, smart home tech is growing and evolving rapidly. Here you'll find the latest product reviews, news, and how-tos to help you connect your surroundings to the internet in the smartest way possible. Read More Ahead of Google I/O, NXP outlined its plans. Leonardo Azevedo, Director of i.MX applications processors at NXP, said the company has been working with customers on developing products to be launched by year end. "Instead of just offering a green grass platform, we focused on a platform that can be rapidly turned into product and work with Google Assistant and built in Android Things," said Azevedo. Separately, NXP said it is working with Google's IoT efforts in the cloud to support smart city deployments. "Voice is being more adopted in homes and adoption is only going faster," he added. "We'll be embedding this into products throughout the home." The win for appliance and home goods makers is that NXP's modules can be added on without a lot of design and technology expertise. Google gets Android Things scale, and NXP, which will be part of Qualcomm, gets a big smart home footprint.

NXP is also a partner for the Amazon Echo. What about voice command conflicts? Azevedo noted that Google's technology has improved so devices can discern which one you'll be talking to even has multiple endpoints will have voice capability. "You just want to talk in the house and know voice is embedded. Just think about walking around the house and having it respond with devices talking to each other," Azevedo said.

The Pixel, as many of you remember, became the highest-rated smartphone camera from DxOMark around the time it launched, netting an overall score of 89. The margin on the HTC U11’s victory is small, as it’s taking home a score of 90. With merely a one point difference between both phones, it’s definitely going to be a little difficult to tell at-a-glance where the HTC U11 exceeds the capabilities of the Google Pixel. DxOMark breaks it down for us, saying that the HTC U11’s “very low noise and fast autofocus helped edge it ahead,” of Google’s flagship. DxOMark was particularly impressed by the phone’s autofocus. Equipped with dual-pixel Phase-Detect Autofocus, DxOMark says that the HTC U11 offers “some of the best autofocus performances of any mobile device we’ve tested.” That seems to remain true regardless of lighting conditions, with DxOMark praising the autofocus in both low-light and bright conditions. When it comes to individual scores, Autofocus takes home the highest marks with a score of 95. Texture and exposure and contrast join autofocus at the top, with scores of 94 and 90 respectively. Color, noise, artifacts, and flash round out the group with scores that range from 85 to 89, and in the end they come together to give the HTC U11’s camera a final ranking of 90. The HTC U11’s camera also scored highly when it came to recording video, netting a final score of 89. DxOMark was pleased with what it said was “very effective stabilization,” and “good detail preservation,” but noted that the camera suffered from detail loss in low-light environments. READ MORE: HTC U11 – Everything you need to knowEven with those few caveats, it seems that most average users really won’t notice the small flaws that DxOMark was able to pick out. In fact, with phones like the Pixel, Galaxy S8, and Xperia X Performance just a few points behind it, it’s hard to imagine substantial, deal-breaking differences in any of those cameras. Still, if you’re going to pick up an HTC U11, you can do so with the knowledge that it offers the highest-rated camera from DxOMark. We can probably expect that to change before long, but for now, the HTC U11 is the reigning champ.

Business Google alleges Uber’s Otto stole trade secrets to develop autonomous trucks James Jaillet | @trucknewsJJ | May 16, 2017 An Otto-equipped Volvo VNL hauled a load of beer along a 120-mile stretch of I-25 in Colorado last year, navigating through Denver in early morning hours in autonomous mode. Autonomous truck technology company Otto, who’s already performed two on-highway demonstrations of an autonomous tractor-trailer, has found itself embroiled in an ongoing court fight between two of Silicon Valley’s most prominent players, Google and Uber, over trade secrets and patents behind automated vehicle technology. Google filed a lawsuit in federal court in February alleging that one of Otto’s top engineers — and formerly an engineer at Google’s self-driving car venture Waymo — downloaded 14,000 confidential Waymo files related to automated vehicle tech and then left the company to found Otto, which includes Otto Trucking. Google also alleges executives from Uber, who acquired Otto last year, had been in touch with Levandowski regarding the files prior to his departure from Waymo. Autonomous truck makes first commercial delivery Drinkers of Budweiser in the Colorado Springs-area will be the first in the world to consume goods delivered by a fully-autonomous truck. A federal judge Monday issued an injunction against Otto and parent company Uber, ordering them to turn over the files to Waymo and the court, should any exist. The injunction is not the end of the lawsuit, but simply an order directing Otto to part ways with Levandowski while the lawsuit unfolds and to turnover the allegedly stolen documents. The judge overseeing the case, U.S. District Judge William Alsup, says Waymo has presented compelling evidence for the injunction order. However, Alsup has allowed Otto to continue development of its autonomous vehicle tech, which Waymo sought to shut down. Uber has disputed the claims in court filings. It argues its LiDAR design is “fundamentally different” than Waymo’s and that it only took one schematic of Waymo’s LiDAR system. “If Waymo genuinely thought that Uber was using its secrets, it would not have waited more than five months to seek an injunction. Waymo doesn’t meet the high bar for an injunction, which would stifle independent innovation and competition.” Otto early last year announced its entrance into the autonomous trucking market as a tech upstart with intentions to produce a retrofit system to give existing trucks autonomous capabilities. The company was acquired by ride-sharing giant Uber months later, and in October it deployed in a 120-mile test an autonomous Volvo VNL tractor that hauled a load of Budweiser from Fort Collins, Colo., through Denver to Colorado Springs on Interstate 25. The company ran a second test in Ohio several weeks later. According to court documents, however, Otto and Levandowski had been in touch with Uber even before Levandowski left Google’s Waymo and before he jointly founded Otto. Google alleges Levandowski installed special software on his Waymo-issued laptop to access Waymo’s confidential files. He then downloaded 9.7 gigabytes of data involving “design files, schematics and other confidential information,” Google alleges in its lawsuit. Nearly a quarter of the allegedly stolen documents contained information on Waymo’s development of LiDAR, an advanced radar system and one of the key components of autonomous vehicle development. Trucking autonomy upstart Otto acquired by Uber "Basically, we're starting a commercial transportation business," says Otto founder Lior Ron. "Specifically we're going to build on Otto's capabilities for self-driving trucks and introduce ... Google alleges Levandowski downloaded the materials onto an external drive on Dec. 14, 2015, and then wiped his laptop clean days later. Google alleges he downloaded a few more LiDAR-related files weeks later. According to court documents, Levandowski had email correspondence with Uber executives in the days following the alleged theft of the documents. Some of the emails referred to a “list of deliverables” and money requested by Levandowski. Levandowski formed Ottmotto on January 15 and Otto Trucking on February 1. Uber officially purchased Otto in August for $680 million and promoted Levandowski to head the company’s autonomous vehicle development — a position directly beneath the CEO, according to court documents. Waymo says it later discovered other employees exiting the company to join Otto, alleging they too stole patented trade secrets. Emails inadvertently sent to Waymo employees also helped build Google’s case, according to court documents. Uber says the lawsuit unfairly impedes implementation of automated vehicle tech and “risks delaying the implementation of technology that could prevent car accidents.” AD Presented By: Chevron On the Horizon: API CK-4 Synthetic Diesel Engine Oils There are still some pockets of resistance to synthetic oils in the heavy duty motor...

That’s the upshot of a federal appeals court’s decision Tuesday rejecting the argument that Google has become so popular as a verb that it should lose its status as a protected trademark. Genericide, as it’s known, is the curse of companies whose brands gain such strong currency in the marketplace that they morph into product categories. Think of aspirin, escalator or yo-yo, but not coke. The fight over whether one of the world’s most valuable brands should be declared generic started when a man named Chris Gillespie in 2012 acquired 763 internet domain names that included the word “google.” After Google filed an objection with the board that referees domain-name disputes and accused Gillespie of “cybersquatting,” he and another man asked an Arizona federal court to cancel Google’s trademark on the grounds that it’s a “generic term universally used to describe the act of internet searching,” according to court filings. The Arizona judge didn’t buy the argument, and on Tuesday, neither did the U.S. Court of Appeals in San Francisco. Sufficient Evidence The men didn’t present sufficient evidence that the public thinks of the word ‘google’ primarily as a generic name for internet search engines rather than as the brand of the Google search engine in particular, the three-judge panel said. “The mere fact that the public sometimes uses a trademark as the name for a unique product does not immediately render the mark generic,” U.S. Circuit Judge Richard Tallman wrote for the panel. Rebecca Ginsberg Rutkoff, a Google spokeswoman, didn’t immediately respond to a phone call seeking comment on the ruling. Exclusive insights on technology around the world. Get Fully Charged, from Bloomberg Technology. Sign Up Tallman noted that other household names, including Coca-Cola Co., have beaten back efforts to have their brands declared generic and unprotected over the years. Coca-Cola won a 1982 trademark-infringement case against a local restaurant that surreptitiously replaced customer orders for “a coke” with a non-Coca-Cola beverage. The restaurant unsuccessfully argued that ”coke” covered a generic category of soft drinks. Jason Kravitz, a Boston-based trademark lawyer, said the appeals court’s decision reinforces how difficult it is for challengers to have brand names declared generic. “These kinds of challenges are par for the course when a company has been successful enough to establish market dominance,” he said. The case is Elliott v. Google Inc., 15-15809, U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit (San Francisco) Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Its Google Cloud IoT Core, announced in a blog post on Tuesday, may be a good use of Google's reach, number-crunching power and device OS expertise. But the problem it aims to solve is daunting, and competitors are already focused on it. The good news for enterprises is that there are several solutions to IoT sprawl already available or taking shape. Just last week, VMware introduced Pulse IoT Center, the latest broad-based platform for setting up, managing and scaling IoT infrastructure. Cloud rival Microsoft has Azure IoT Hub, with a similar mission. Cisco Systems, General Electric and Nokia are also in the game. [ Further reading: The best home water leak detectors ] Google says its cloud services, including Google Cloud Dataflow, Big Query and Cloud Machine Learning Engine, set Cloud IoT Core apart from rival offerings. The service is going into private beta now and will be generally available by the end of this year. Though automation should help companies manage an IoT infrastructure, setting one up is still a daunting task, analysts say. For an enterprise, implementing IoT calls for major organizational changes in addition to technical effort, according to Gartner analyst Alfonso Veloso. It can reshape whole business processes. Cloud IoT Core will make it easier for companies to set up pilot projects to get their feet wet, then scale up their IoT efforts, said Indranil Chakraborty, a Google Cloud product manager. The targets for Google's new service are as industrial as they come, like utilities, shipping and transportation providers, and oil and gas companies. Google has been less present in those kinds of organizations than many other vendors. But Cloud IoT Core includes a suite of capabilities designed for diverse IoT on a global scale. The idea is that Google will use its cloud for device setup and management, plus ingestion of data from those devices through MQTT, a standard machine-to-machine protocol. Once the data's in the cloud, Google can turn it into real-time insights and other knowledge with its own analytics services as well as partners' tools, such as Tableau and Zoomdata. The service should give customers new operational insights for tasks like predicting utility customers' energy use in real time and scheduling maintenance for manufacturing equipment before it breaks to minimize downtime, Google says. It will include security from the device to the cloud using TLS (Transport Layer Security). For products based on Android Things, built-in security will extend to the OS. Cloud IoT Core will handle automatic patches and updates to Android Things devices, and for other OSes, third parties can build automatic update systems that use Cloud IoT Core, Chakraborty said.

Sending Google Play credit gifts seems to have quietly vanished from the Play Store Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/05/16 7:30am PDTMay 16, 2017 8 Plus 1 on G+ 14 Share on Facebook 32 Share on Twitter Total Shares54 News Google added an interesting option for gift giving occasions to the Play Store in late 2015—electronic Google Play gift cards. This feature has been available in the deep recesses of the Play Store ever since... until recently when it seems to have disappeared. Google support is confirming to people it pulled the feature. Indeed, if you go to the Play Store now, the "Send gift" option is no longer in the sidebar. The gift cards were available in $10, $15, $20, $25, $50, and $100 denominations. The gifts were delivered via email, instantly adding your chosen amount to the recipient's balance. According to a support chat provided by a reader, Google removed this feature for "security reasons" in a recent Play Store update. Support suggests you use a third-party retailer, which would still permit you to send a Google Play gift card electronically. Weird, but okay, Google.

DxO announced the news a few hours ago, giving the U11 a top score of 90, one point better than the Google Pixel and 4 points higher than the iPhone 7. If you haven’t heard of the HTC U11, we’ll forgive you. Unlike, say, the iPhone 7, Samsung Galaxy S8, or Google Pixel, it wasn’t the benefactor of the same sort of hype. In fact, its marquee feature is this strange “squeezable” gimmick: But that’s not all it can do, as DxOMark Mobile discovered when they put the phone’s 12-megapixel camera with dual pixel AF, multi-axis optical and electronic stabilization, and f/1.7 aperture to the test. The U11 performed exceptionally well across the board—with particularly high marks in Autofocus, Stabilization, and Noise—becoming their highest-scoring smartphone cam ever tested. “Not only is the HTC U11 the highest-scoring phone we’ve ever tested, it’s the highest-scoring in both still image quality and video quality, beating out the Google Pixel by 1 point in each,” writes DxOMark in their conclusion. “Those who want to shoot and share their photos will particularly appreciate the vibrant colors and bright exposures of the HTC U11 […] The HTC U11’s very low noise and excellent detail preservation also allow for sharing and printing larger-sized images than with most other phones.” You can see how the U11 compares to the Pixel in every category below: To see sample shots and a full breakdown of their tests, head over to DxOMark Mobile by clicking here.

Amazon just needs to make a few tweaks to its execution, and partner closer with Google. Todd Haselton | @robotodd 15 Hours AgoCNBC.com SHARES Getty Images Amazon.com founder and CEO Jeff Bezos presenting the company's first smartphone, the Fire Phone, in June of 2014 in Seattle, Washington. Amazon's first smartphone was a dud, but thanks to advances in Amazon's technology and a boost around its brand, it's time for Amazon to give the market another shot. First, some history. Back in 2014, Amazon launched a device named the "Amazon Fire Phone." You'd be forgiven if you've already forgotten about it. In fact, the phone sold so poorly Amazon had to take a $170 million write-off on the attempt. Amazon The phone failed for several reasons, chief of which was the device simply couldn't offer what other products on the market did. It was buggy, had no access to popular Google apps such as Maps, Gmail and more (even though it was built on Android) and didn't have any "must-have" features. The Fire Phone was also exclusive to AT&T and, before Amazon quickly dropped the price of the device, was too expensive if purchased without a carrier contract. At the time, it felt weird to see Amazon enter the smartphone market. It just wasn't a brand anyone really thought could change the smartphone market, and it was pretty clear the company was doing little more than testing the waters. Amazon, at least in my eyes at the time, was a relatively boring company that sold tablets and e-readers but wasn't really good at other hardware. Then Amazon started to introduce and sell products that people began to love. Devices like the Amazon Echo and Echo Dot, which allow us to play music and control parts of our home, seem to be cherished by everyone who owns one. Folks love other products like the Amazon Fire TV Stick, too, which is cheap and provides access to Amazon's store, Alexa and streaming content for free with a Prime subscription. Todd Haselton | CNBC These devices helped Amazon establish itself not only as an online retailer, but as a maker of creative and useful hardware. Alexa, Amazon's smart AI assistant that powers some of those devices, is becoming smarter and more useful than ever. Alexa should be the heart of Amazon's new smartphone The smart assistants on our smartphones are going to become more and more important. They already tell us when we should leave for work to avoid traffic, alert us to our next meeting and remind us to buy flowers for Mother's Day. They're only getting smarter. The good news for Amazon is that Alexa is one of the best personal assistants out there. Todd Haselton | CNBC CNBC: Huawei Alexa featured Now that Alexa has matured, Amazon has AI that could make its smartphone truly great. Alexa has thousands of abilities and can be used for much more than competitors such as Siri and Cortana, and is arguably only matched by Google Assistant. I can use Alexa to order paper towels, play music and check a sports score. And, thanks to a new feature rolled out last week, I can even use Alexa to place make phone calls and send free messages. Within just a few years, if not sooner, I think Alexa will know more about me than I do, and only Google seems like it's going to be able to predict more than ever. Amazon should seize the opportunity to get Alexa in as many hands as possible. Alexa isn't enough to build a winning smartphone, however. But Amazon can't rely on Alexa alone to build a great smartphone. Amazon will also need to change its game plan and license Google's full suite of products, something it didn't do last time. That means out-of-the-box access to Google's app store, Gmail, Chrome, Maps and more. It should also offer some of the same incentives it did when it launched the first Fire Phone, like free Amazon Prime for a year. Rick Wilking | Reuters Mike George, VP Alexa, Echo and Appstore for Amazon, speaks during the LG press conference at CES in Las Vegas, January 4, 2017 Amazon could cut the cost of its smartphone, too, and sell an unlocked device that could be purchased direct on its store and that would work across U.S. and international carriers. Manufacturers like Motorola, Huawei, Alcatel and others all build good smartphones that can cost under $300. Anything more, and I think Amazon risks competing too closely with big hitters like Samsung and Apple. Yes, you can get Amazon's apps and services on other smartphone platforms, but a single device built around Amazon's services and Alexa, one that could provide on-demand voice access to the smart assistant, unlimited access to Amazon's music and video services, and with a low up-front cost, would be very appealing. Let's recap Let's take a look back at the key takeaways that Amazon needs if it wants a more successful launch: Alexa needs to be the heart of the smartphone. Amazon needs to license Google's services, such as Gmail and Maps. Access to the Google Play App store will allow customers to do more with their phones. Amazon should offer a free year of Prime with each service, which it did originally. The phone needs to cost much less than the original, and shouldn't be exclusive to a wireless carrier. CEO Jeff Bezos has suggested there will be iterations of the device, so let's see one. Todd HaseltonTechnology Product Editor
