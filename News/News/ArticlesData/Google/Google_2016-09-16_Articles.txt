One of the biggest attractions people tend to see in iOS 10 is its looks which, no doubt, are pretty stunning. With transparency as far as the eye can see and gestures, animations, and clean wallpapers that are extremely appealing, some users may be tempted to switch over to Apple’s side. And yes, I’m talking about Android users. See, some of us Droid users don’t really want to switch over to iOS, but with its looks and feature set you may be pretty tempted. But if you’re like me, you just simply don’t have the cash in the bank to score an iPhone running the latest software. Luckily, since I’m directing this conversation to Android users, there’s an answer to your problem, and it comes in the form of a launcher. Yes, that’s right people. At the heart of Android is customization, everywhere from the home screen to how your keyboard looks, what lock screen you use, and which quick access toggles appear in the notification shade. And while all of this can be tweaked to fit your lifestyle or personality, some of you may be looking for something similar to iOS. Sure, I don’t have a killer lock screen or iOS-replicated keyboard I can show you, but with a certain launcher available for free on the Play Store and one wallpaper, you can score a very similar experience to iOS 10 right on your Android phone. Let’s jump into how you can get an iOS 10 look and feel right on your Android phone in as little as two steps. 1. The Launcher: Evie Introduction The launcher we’ll be using for that iOS 10-like experience is one I’ve grown very fond to called Evie. It’s available for free in the Play Store and is entirely focused around the idea of search. A universal pull-down search shade can be accessed from anywhere in the launcher which allows you to search for apps and games either on your phone or available from the Play Store alongside find music, movies and show times, contacts, and Google searches right from your home screen. Of course, all of this can be accessed via something like the Google Now Launcher, but we’re going for an iOS vibe here and not a stock Android one. Transparency is the name of the game for Evie. All over this launcher you’ll find transparent backgrounds which give off a different effect depending on the type of wallpapers you choose. I tend to go for busier wallpapers with more detail as they look best with the bokeh and transparent looks Evie gives you, but that’s just my opinion. There’s also one big factor coming into play that this launcher tends to capitalize off of a bit, and that’s the lack of an app drawer… button. See, by swiping all the way to the left hand side of Evie, you’ll find your app drawer. Rather a button on a dock (which, by the way, is for some reason not present), you’ll be using swiping gestures to access all your apps. If you’re not a fan of this method, you can always pull down and start typing. Within this left-most pane is where you’ll find your widgets and settings as well (yep, widgets are available in this iOS-like launcher which, by the way, are probably one of the shining features). Things like the ability to change your icon size to the icon pack, how many rows and columns you want present on your home screen for app shortcuts, and whether you’d like a slick-looking Google app swipe-up shortcut on your home screen are all present in the settings section. You’ve also got access to a feedback link which will allow you to send your feedback about Evie to the developers, something I’ve done many a time with many a response from Team Evie themselves. All in all, this method of navigation is very fluid and very reminiscent of iOS. If you’re looking for a launcher similar to iOS 10 but shares the same powers of Android like embeddable widgets and icon packs, Evie’s the way to go. With universal search, you’ll no doubt find apps on your Droid as fast or faster than an iPhone, plus have access to movie showtimes, music links, Google searches, and contacts. I for one love Evie and definitely think it’s worth checking out. How to install On your Android phone, go to the Play Store, tap the search bar, enter “Evie”, and hit “Enter”. Alternatively, you can tap this link on your device. Then, when you find the listing that says, “Evie Launcher”, tap on it and tap “Install”. Evie will begin installing and can then be set as your default home screen by pressing the home button and hitting Evie > Always on the popup menu. After that’s completed, feel free to set up your icons, grid size, widgets, and more just the way you like it. But don’t bother changing your wallpaper just yet. That step’s coming up right now. 2. The Wallpaper: Stock iOS 10 To give Evie a really strong iOS 10-like feel, I’ve grabbed the stock iOS 10 wallpaper from the internet and copied it over to my phone. Then when I set the wallpaper, I get a very iOS-like appearance thanks to Evie’s launcher and feature set and the background ripped straight off of Apple’s smartphones. If you’d like to download the image to your phone and complete our iOS 10 experience on Android, long press on this link and select “Save link”. Once that’s completed, the image will begin downloading to your phone and you’ll be ready to set it as your wallpaper. To set this image as your wallpaper, right inside Evie, head over to the left-most panel, swipe twice to the right to access the “Settings” pane, tap “Change Wallpaper”, and in the available images, tap “My photos”. This will take you to a file manager-type interface. From the hamburger menu on the left, just tap “Recent” and the wallpaper we downloaded should be the first one listed. Tap on the background, hit “Set wallpaper” at the top, and you’re good to go. You’re now rocking the stock iOS 10 wallpaper and the gloreous iOS 10 -like launcher Evie. Honorable Mentions If a custom launcher and wallpaper aren’t enough to satisfy your iOS appetite, below I’ve linked some icons packs that tend to give off an iOS vibe alongside a couple of additional wallpaper ZIP files that’ll no doubt give you the Apple-like experience you’re looking for. Icon Packs Squircle (free) Adastra (free) Elta (free) Wallpapers iPhone 7/Plus stock wallpapers All iOS 10 built-in wallpapers After you’re all finished with the steps listed, you’ll be rocking a very similar look to iOS 10 right on your Android phone. And not only will you have the looks, but you’ve also got some of the functionality from iOS’ home screen like the built-in pull down search feature. All in all, I’m a pretty big fan of this look as I’ve always liked iOS 10’s look and feel. But since I don’t have an iPhone, I found this Android ‘edition’ of the software the next best thing. What’s your take? Do you like the iOS 10 look and feel granted by Evie Launcher and the wallpapers on your Android phone?

We compiled the full list of rumors pertaining to the Pixel XL, so you know what to expect. Pictured: Google Nexus 6P  ( Google ) Advertisement Google is getting ready to launch new flagship smartphones in 2016, and everyone is curious what the company that rolled out the highly commendable Nexus 6P will bring up next.  Rumors are rich about Google's upcoming Nexus devices, which have one edge over their rivals as they come packing the pure version of the Android OS. Insiders familiar with the matter report that Google re-branded the gadgets, taking away the traditional "Nexus" names, but we might be looking at a new design approach as well. By looking at surfaced codenames for the handsets, we can say that two more Google smartphones will be landing in 2016. The codenames, T50 and T55, can be hints to the screen sizes of the two devices. The first should therefore sport a 5-inch display, while the larger model is expected to bring a 5.5-inch screen framed by extremely thin bezels. Multiple media outlets reported that Google pulled the plug on the "Nexus" moniker and instead chose to call its upcoming handsets Pixel. Just as a reminder, the OEM previously used Pixel to name its proprietary tablet and Chromebooks. The 5-inch smartphone will be called Pixel, while the phablet will be dubbed Pixel XL. Google will not build the Pixel variants itself but will outsource the manufacturing process to other companies, with Huawei purported as the main candidate. Other speculations claim that HTC will craft the Pixel or the Pixel XL, but it is yet unclear which model will be manufactured by HTC and which from Huawei. Android Authority reports that the tinier Pixel will feature a chassis of aluminum and glass. Both models will probably have a glass back, with an extra metal frame protecting the Pixel XL. Both the Pixel and Pixel XL are purportedly packing the Snapdragon 820 processor, which is already deployed in a number of top-shelf smartphones. Other sources hint that Qualcomm's recently announced Snapdragon 821 processors will equip the upcoming Google smartphones. LlabTooFeR says that the new Pixel smartphones will holster 12-megapixel back-facing snappers and 8-megapixel selfie-ready cameras. Insiders familiar with the matter note that the Pixel XL could have a 2K screen, while the smaller Pixel will make use of a standard 1080p screen. While both models will pack 4 GB of RAM and 32 GB of default storage space, the Pixel XL is said to carry a mighty 3,450 mAh power source. Those who are worried that Google will take a leaf out of Apple's book on the headphone jack can rest assured. The Pixel phones will come with the 3.5 mm traditional headphone plug-in slot, so users can use their favorite headsets for years to come. Speaking of connectivity, Google does make some steps toward the future by ditching the microUSB and relying on the all-rounded USB-C on its future Pixel handsets. It is to be expected that Google will embed its latest operating system, Android 7.0 Nougat, in its future Pixel smartphones. People close to the matter touts that Google will make the official announcement of the Pixel handsets on Oct. 4, with the devices hitting the stores as early as Oct. 20.

Here’s His Story Video by Josh Block; Article by Blake Edwards On his daily commute from New Jersey, Jack Chen, a lawyer in Google’s New York offices in Chelsea, navigates two train stations, the subway, and busy sidewalks using only what he can hear and smell, the feedback he gets from his cane, and the mental map he’s created in the six years he’s worked at Google. “Poles and columns, such as you’ll find in the lower level of the A/C/E train in Penn Station, are some of my nemeses,” he said. “I figured out that if I pass the first one and hang what is approximately a 45 degree angle, I can walk through all of them without encountering another one.” Last month, Chen, totally blind since 16, let us tag along on the last legs of his commute. He also gave us an inside look at his life at Google, showing us around the offices and sitting for a video interview. A graduate of Fordham Law School, Chen started as an associate patent counsel at Google in 2010. In 2014 he became the company’s product counsel in charge of Chrome: what he called “the quarterback or the general counsel of the product from a legal perspective.” When Gayathri Rajan, a VP of product management based in California, first started emailing with him, she didn’t know Chen was visually impaired. “No one [at Google] is going to tell you, ‘Hey, Jack is going to be working as product counsel, and by the way, he’s blind.'” Chen has degrees in computer science from Harvard and Berkeley. Before law school, Chen interned at AT&T, and worked as a systems engineer at Xanboo Inc., a New York-based startup that produced internet-based home automation and security systems (the company was acquired by AT&T in 2010). He also spent two years as a patent and trademark attorney in the New York office of Kenyon & Kenyon, and three years as an associate at Baker Botts. Susan Lang, president and CEO of Lime Connect, a non-profit that helps people with disabilities find jobs, believes companies are missing out on people like Chen. “No existing organization was focused on high potential candidates at universities, and people who had graduated university,” Lang said in an interview last month. “Corporate America was missing out on some potential rock stars.” According to Census Bureau statistics organized by Cornell University, there were more than 7 million adults, age 21-64, with a visual disability in the U.S. in 2014. Only about 27 percent had full-time, year-round employment, and almost 60 percent were completely unemployed. Blind lawyers in particular have made a mark publicly — like former Skadden Fellow Haben Girma; or international human rights lawyer Chen Guangcheng — and even hold a place in popular culture, like Marvel Comic’s Daredevil character. In 2013, the American Bar Association issued a pledge asking employers to affirm their commitment to diversity in the legal profession, “including diversity with respect to individuals with mental, physical, and sensory disabilities.” The pledge has been signed by a number of Big Law firms, and large companies like Microsoft, Starbucks, and Walgreens. “Diversity and accessibility are broader than just what people look like or culture: It’s all walks of life, including people with disabilities,” said Myisha Frazier, a senior corporate counsel at Google, and Chen’s supervisor. According to a 2011 report from the ABA, almost seven percent of its members reported having a disability. Although 41 percent of ABA entities reported having a lawyer with a disability in a leadership position, there were no chairs or chairs-elect with a disability. “It’s important that we have laws in place protecting people — the ‘stick’ model — but what’s really going to drive lasting change is when people with disabilities are in the C-suite, running companies,” Chen said. ››››› Chen reads by listening: he uses a screen reader at his desk, where he’s usually standing (when he’s not working on a nearby treadmill desk), and the VoiceOver function on his iPhone. Typically, Chen has the speed set at around 620 words a minute, a speed that is, to the untrained ear, incomprehensible. When Chen travels for work, he has some familiar spaces mapped out in his head, but his personal assistant, Carolyn Lewis, often looks up where he’s going and writes out step-by-step instructions to help Chen avoid the biggest obstacles as he walks down unfamiliar streets, checks in at a new hotel, or makes his way through an airport. When Chen attended CNET’s CES conference in Las Vegas earlier this year, held annually to showcase the latest tech gadgets, Gayathri said she was worried about Chen walking with the Google team around Vegas. He had no trouble keeping up, she said. Chen has competed in five triathlons, including two Iron Man triathlons, consisting of a 2.4-mile swim, a 112-mile bicycle ride, and a 26.2-mile run. Chen does the swimming and running portions by hooking to another athlete with a length of rope; he rides the biking portion on a tandem bicycle. When Chen was preparing for his most recent triathlon, he said he routinely got up at 3:00 a.m. to train before coming into the office. Asked about his work ethic, Lewis said, “The best way that I can put it is, I very often have a hard time keeping up with him.” In 2012, Chen climbed Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania. “Kilimanjaro has the distinction of being one of the Seven Summits that is doable without special climbing gear,” Chen said. “I wanted to test myself but I didn’t have a lot of time to work on learning climbing techniques. I figured if I liked it, I could get into the gear later and try other peaks.” As we were wrapping up our video interview last month, our camera operator Douglas Higginbotham had a question about Chen’s Kilimanjaro trip: “Don’t take this the wrong way,” he said. “But if you can’t see the view when you get to the top, why would you climb a mountain?” Lewis, Chen’s assistant, answered before Chen had a chance: “Because it’s there,” she said. Courtesy of Jack Chen Chen says that as a child he could see light, colors, and vague shapes, and recalls riding his bike in the street, able to navigate by the sharp contrast between the blacktop and the curbs. Chen believes experiences like these helped him later, when all of his vision was gone. “I generally couldn’t see cars and had to pretty much rely on my sense of sound to alert me if there was one coming,” Chen said. “Thankfully electric cars weren’t popular back then.” At 16, Chen underwent an operation to improve his vision, but the surgery, his eighth or ninth at that time, went poorly. “My optic nerve was damaged in earlier operations in one eye,” Chen said. “In the remaining eye, during a critical part of the operation, my head involuntarily moved, and there was some hemorrhaging. My retina broke apart.” The precise medical reasons for his disability are unclear, Chen said, but there’s good reason to think it’s genetic: Chen’s brother, Richard, was also born with a severe visually impairment, though he’s not totally blind. A double graduate of Harvard, he’s also, like Chen, the beneficiary of some genetic gifts. “He’s that guy who won all of the awards in school,” Chen said. ››››› Perhaps surprisingly, of all the miles he’s biked, swam, ridden, and climbed, Chen was most animated and loquacious describing his daily commute from New Jersey. Normally, he relies heavily on his ears to get him where he’s going, but in parts of Penn Station, the subway platform especially, it’s too loud and hectic to make sense of what he’s hearing, he said. “I also use smells to tell me where I am,” Chen said. “I pass by a coffee place and the Subway sandwich place, and those are smell landmarks to let me know that I have properly made that left turn and am heading to the subway.” Once Chen leaves the subway station at 14th street, a few blocks from his office, he’s over the hump but not exactly home free: “There are planters and a driveway with cars sometimes,” he said. “You can imagine how difficult this is for someone who can essentially ‘see’, with a cane, only three to four feet in front of them.” When we followed Chen on his commute last month, we met up with him in Penn Station at 8:45, rode the subway to Chelsea, and filmed him walking to his office on Ninth Avenue. Just a few hundred yards from the office, Higginbotham, camera mounted on his shoulder to record Chen’s journey, was backpedaling, and tripped and fell into a flower bed. There were immediately obvious comparisons to be made: it turns out being able to see where you’re going does come in handy when walking. Chen just smiled and asked if everyone was okay. ›››››   Authors Big Law Business Sharing Twitter Facebook Google + Linkedin Email this article Print this article Tags Diversity & Inclusion, In-House, In-House Perspective, Law Firm, Legal Industry, Most Read, Profiles, Talent Management, Technology, The Legal Market BLB Videos, Diversity, Google, In-House, Video Related posts Partner or Protector? How Inside Counsel Can Get to ‘Yes’ (Perspective) How to Resolve Big Law’s Diversity Problem? … $$$ The Trump Effect on U.S. M&A Landscape (Video) Sponsored: External Resources Brexit Resource Center Newsflash: Brexit Timing in Doubt Brexit Bulletin: Issues That Firms Should Be Considering Now Data Protection and the General Data Protection Regulation in the UK Post-Brexit Brexit Bulletin: Leaving the Single Market and the Customs Union Brexit Bulletin: Deals or No Trade Deals Brexit Bulletin: Which Model for UK-EU Trade?

By Jake Smith for iGeneration | September 17, 2016 -- 20:34 GMT (13:34 PDT) | Topic: Cloud Image: File photo Google is ditching the "Google for Work" branding for its enterprise products, according to sources at The Information. Tech giants court retailers chasing omnichannel dream Technology vendors are using a gloomy backdrop to pitch omnichannel, analytics and the Internet of things as magic bullets vs. Amazon. Read More Google is said to replace the name with "Google Cloud", which will stretch across its business-focused productivity apps, cloud services, maps, Chromebooks and Android devices, search, and business services. While the company is remaining quiet on specifics, Google Cloud Chief Diane Greene already announced the changes in an internal email, The Information reports. An official announcement could come at Google's cloud-focused event on Sept. 29 in San Francisco, Calif. Google already casts Google for Work as having "pioneering cloud technologies that enable millions of people to work the way they choose." A name change to include cloud doesn't seem too far fetched, as Google looks to take on Amazon and Microsoft's increasingly focused cloud efforts. We have reached out to Google for more details.

Andrés Cardenal (TMFacardenal) Sep 17, 2016 at 12:40PM Image source: Alphabet. Wall Street analysts are having a romance with Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL). According to data from FactSet, 41 analysts are currently rating Alphabet as a buy or overweight, while only 4 analysts consider the stock a hold recommendation. As of the time of this writing, there are no sell or underweight recommendations on Alphabet. The stock has delivered impressive returns lately, Alphabet is up by over 21% in the last year. Nevertheless, Wall Street analysts believe that it still has more room for gains: The average price target among analysts following the company is around $921 per share, implying an upside potential of nearly 20% from current price levels. Professional analysts can make mistakes just like everyone else, and it's of utmost importance to fully understand the rationale behind an investment thesis as opposed to blindly investing in accordance to recommendations from analysts. In that spirit, let's take a look at Alphabet stock in order to find out if Wall Street's optimism is based on solid reasons or not. A tale of two businesses Alphabet has basically two different business segments: Google and Other Bets. Google is the undisputed leader in online advertising around the world, thanks to enormously valuable properties such as Google Search, Android, Maps, Chrome, YouTube, Google Play, and Gmail. The Other Bets division is a group of highly innovative projects in futuristic areas like self-driving cars, high-speed internet, and healthcare technologies, among several others.  Google is facing growing competitive pressure from younger companies in social media, which are rapidly gaining ground in online advertising. Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) is a particularly relevant player to watch in this segment. According to financial reports for the second quarter of 2016, Facebook's revenue exploded by 59% year over year during the period, while revenue at Google grew 21% versus the second quarter of 2015. Online advertising is a dynamic industry, and it's only natural for players like Facebook to grow at a faster rate than Google from a smaller revenue base. Nevertheless, Google is well-positioned in key industry areas such as mobile and video, and the company comes second to none in its bread-and-butter search business. The Google brand is so powerful that many consumers use the expression "googling" for information as a synonym for online search. The Other Bets division is operating in the red, and it's hard to tell what kind of profitability Alphabet can generate from these projects over the middle term. On the other hand, from a long-term perspective, opportunities for growth and disruption are quite interesting in this portfolio of projects. The whole is stronger than the sum of the parts when it comes to Alphabet. Google generates consistently big cash flows over time, and management gets to allocate a share of that money into different projects in Other Bets. This allows the company to have a strategic long-term approach to growth investments: Since it doesn't depend on external financing, Alphabet doesn't need to worry much about short-term profitability. Patience and a long-term horizon can make all the difference in the world when operating at the forefront of technological innovation. By the numbers In terms of overall financial performance, Alphabet doesn't leave much to be desired. The company has increased revenue at more than 20% annually over the last five years, and it's still expanding at an impressive speed considering its size. Total revenue grew 21% year over year during the second quarter, amounting to $21.5 billion. Sales excluding the negative impact from currency fluctuations grew 25%.  The business model is also highly profitable: Alphabet generates an operating profit margin in the neighborhood of 28% of revenue. Adjusted operating margin, which excludes stock-based compensation and other non-cash charges, amounted to 35% of sales last quarter.  Cash flow from operations grew 28% during the second quarter, and the company produced $6.9 billion in free cash flow, an increase of 53% versus the same period in the prior year. In addition, Alphabet is sitting on $78.5 billion in cash and liquid investments on its balance sheet. This provides abundant dry powder to invest in all kinds of projects and acquisitions, or to simply reward investors with cash distributions in the future. Even the most extraordinary businesses can turn out to be lousy investments if the stock is priced at unreasonable levels, but that's hardly the case when it comes to Alphabet. In fact, the stock looks fairly valued: Alphabet trades at a forward price-to-earnings ratio around 19, roughly in line with the average company in the S&P 500 index. When considering fundamental quality and financial performance, Alphabet is an exceptional business, and the stock is priced at very reasonable levels, if not downright undervalued. With this in mind, it's easy to see why analysts are falling in love with Alphabet stock. Suzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

Usually, when we get closer to an announcement, there are plenty of rumors and leaks that spring out of the water works, and Google can’t seem to patch the holes. We’ve already seen the renamed Pixel Launcher that replaced the former Nexus Launcher, and we have also seen the Pixel’s specs leaked courtesy of a Geekbench results page. Now, we have our first look at what may be the front display panels for both the Pixel and Pixel XL. Measuring in at 4.99-inches and 5.46-inches, respectively, this may give us a better idea as to the size of the devices, rather than the overall design. Since these are just front panels, it’s possible these were old prototype’s that have since been scratched or these may be the real deal. It’s just not really able to tell at this point in time. But if they do turn out to be real, this may conflict with the cases that are now up for sale on AliExpress. These cases appeared yesterday and if they are legitimate, show that both devices will feature the fingerprint scanners on the rear of the device, and will not remove the 3.5mm headphone jack that everyone is up in arms about right now. The cases do show that the Pixel will measure in at 5.2-inches, with the Pixel XL measuring in at 5.5-inches. Finally, we find some legitimacy in regards to the Pixel devices. There are 4 entries in the Global Certification Forum database which show that HTC will indeed be the manufacturer. The reason for 4 entries versus just 2 is that there will reportedly be a North American variant and an International variant for each device. We already knew that HTC would be the manufacturer, but this pretty much all but verifies that knowledge. To recap, here are the expected specs of the Pixel and Pixel XL based on the rumors and leaks that we’ve seen over the last few months: Google Pixel Google Pixel XL Display 5-inch FHD (1920×1080) 5.5-inch QHD (2560×1440) Processor Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 RAM 4GB 4GB Storage 32GB/128GB 32GB/128GB Camera 8MP (front) / 13MP (rear) 8MP (front) / 13MP (rear) Battery 2,770mAh 3,450mAh Software Android 7.1 Nougat Android 7.1 Nougat In addition to being the first devices to run Android 7.1 Nougat, we are expecting to see a redesigned navigation bar layout, with the buttons filled in. The home button may end up being a solid circle, which is a move away from the “flower” design that we saw floating around in the past. Additionally, the icons on the home screen will now be round, to follow along with Google’s own Material Design guidelines. As for the build itself, both devices will look similar to the HTC 10, but won’t feature any HTC branding. Instead, there’s a possibility that Google will opt for its “G” symbol on the rear of the devices. Both the Pixel and Pixel XL will feature an aluminum build, with a glass or glossy plastic overlay which is where the various antennas will be housed. The front of the Pixel and Pixel XL will feature nothing other than the earpiece at the top, with its speakers being built into the earpiece. Trying to condense all of these rumors is a bit of a pain, but we are so close to the official unveiling that we can smell it and are getting more excited by the day. Speaking of, earlier rumors suggested that Google will be holding an event on October 4th where the new Pixel devices will be unveiled alongside the Google Home, Google’s Daydream Viewer, and a new 4K-enabled Chromecast. What do you think about all of this? Are you getting impatient as we near the supposed release of these devices? Are you holding out for the release of the Pixel or Pixel XL?

The school system, called “AltSchool,” now operates eight small private schools — six in the San Francisco Bay Area and two in New York — with ambitious plans to eventually license its program and proprietary software to other private — and public — schools across the country. NewsHour Weekend Special Correspondent Joanne Jennings has our story, which is part of American Graduate Day, a public media initiative to address the high school dropout crisis. EMILY GREENBERG: What’s that I hear? STUDENT: It’s Mission Impossible. EMILY GREENBERG: Oh my gosh, we must be in for a real treat. JOANNE JENNINGS: Emily Greenberg is introducing her students to “Passion Projects” at AltSchool’s newest location in downtown San Francisco. EMILY GREENBERG: We’re thinking of passion projects about something I’ve always wanted to know about, but I kind of never got the time to figure that thing out and here’s your time. JOANNE JENNINGS: In Greenberg’s class, student proposals range from learning Spanish to building a go-kart. EMILY GREENBERG: You’ll need to learn about go-karting. You are going to need materials. JOANNE JENNINGS: The mission of this network of private, for profit schools is to personalize the educational experience, in part, by letting these kindergarten through 8th grade students decide 20 percent of their schedule. EMILY GREENBERG: So it’s the idea that 20 percent of their week, or their time, will be spent doing something that’s really personally meaningful to them. It may not fit into, necessarily, our core academic growth, but it’s something that’s truly meaningful to them as a person. It really fits into that personalized whole-child thinking. JOANNE JENNINGS: The concept of 20 percent time originated at Google, where AltSchool’s founders once worked. In its early days, google gave employees one day a week to pursue whatever they wanted, passion projects that resulted in products like Gmail. EMILY GREENBERG: We’ve done a lot of research into how that might fit into our classroom, and what it might look like at AltSchool. JOANNE JENNINGS: The philosophy of AltSchool is to avoid a one size fits all approach to education. Let students choose more of what they do in school, program a “playlist” of lessons responsive to student interests, collect data on how students learn by monitoring their computer use and performance in class, and track progress to give teachers quantitative feedback. The concept came into focus for 35-year-old AltSchool Founder Max Ventilla when he and his wife started to look at pre-schools for their daughter. At the time, he was in charge of “personalization” at Google, developing those user profiles based on how you use the internet, which websites you visit, and what terms you search for. MAX VENTILLA: As a parent, with my wife, thinking about when my daughter was two, kinda what would she do during the elementary school years, and not necessarily finding those schools that we thought would prepare our daughter, who’s very different than us, for the very different kinda life she will lead. The kind of school that I wanted is actually something that the teams that I’ve always been part of might be able to support. Not just for one school, but for many, many schools in the long run. JOANNE JENNINGS: Ventilla, whose daughter started AltSchool this year, believes applying Google’s user profile techniques to create learner profiles can improve student performance. So, AltSchool draws inferences about its students the same way Google does, by collecting their data. MAX VENTILLA: It’s the same in an education context. The idea that, as you start to have this deep understanding of who a child is, and what a child does, you’re able to start to make inferences and suggestions and say, ‘similar students pursuing objectives like that were really well served by this kind of experience.’ Maybe that’s something that, as a student, or as a teacher for that student, you might want to consider. INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY EMPLOYEE: Something that you need to know is that I can definitely see, and so can your teachers, I can see everything you do on your Chromebooks. JOANNE JENNINGS: Even elementary school students are told every keystroke on their laptops used in class is monitored. Teachers analyze how students answer questions and interact to better understand how each child is learning and then they use that information to customize what they give students to read. Even current event articles on the website “Newsela.” EMILY GREENBERG: And this will be how you find an article that I just assigned to you based on your reading level. JOANNE JENNINGS: By using the information collected, teachers create so-called “Playlist Cards” — a customized lesson plan for each individual student. Emily Dahm heads two AltSchools. EMILY DAHM: Behind the scenes, teachers are creating units made up of these cards. A lot of what the kids end up doing is off the screen. A playlist card might ask a student to play a game or build something, and then they’re going back to that playlist card to document their work. JOANNE JENNINGS: Last spring, PBS’s “Nova” captured middle school student Juan Martin using his playlist to apply a math lesson about ratios to designing a model home. JUAN MARTIN: Well, right now, I have this playlist about being mindful of my scale. JOANNE JENNINGS: Through a combination of online and in-person interactions with his teacher, Martin realized that one inch in his model could represent five feet at full scale. The lesson, which is preserved digitally, can be useful to other students in the future. EMILY DAHM: Our technology enables educators to create curriculum and also capture data about students that can be shared with other educators. An educator might create a unit which can be used by another educator, and that educator might improve upon it and then use it again with their kids. That’s just not something that can be done easily without this technology. JOANNE JENNINGS: AltSchool teachers also get feedback from these cameras and microphones hanging in every classroom, recording every lesson. EMILY GREENBERG: And it’s great to be able to review and think, “How could I have done that in a better way, or in a more effective way,” or “Next time, when I deliver this mini-lesson, maybe I’ll use a different tool next time,” or “That student looked super off-task, how can I help that student.” JOANNE JENNINGS: Alt school eighth grader Janice Demings says she was wary of the cameras at first. JANICE DEMINGS: Everyone was like so freaked about the cameras, like, “Oh, my god! They’re spying on us and they have like a whole spy team.” We started a petition to get rid of the cameras just for fun, and now I feel that the cameras are a very beneficial thing because the cameras are here to track how we’re growing as a class, how we’re growing in our interactions. JOANNE JENNINGS: Only teachers have access to the video, and AltSchool says it follows strict guidelines that forbid sharing it. AltSchool also says it encrypts all the data, which is retained on secure servers. Mark Eisner is the father of 8th-grader Emma. JOANNE JENNINGS: One of the ways personalization is possible is by collecting a lot of information about your daughter and the other kids here. How do you feel about that? MARK EISNER: I feel fine about it. They do need to collect information and data to make good decisions and I think that’s fine. I mean it’s all oriented toward teaching and you know refining the overall educational model they are trying to do. JOANNE JENNINGS: Since opening in 2013, AltSchool says its students have scored above national averages in standardized tests but declined to share any scores. A report last year from the Gates Foundation and the Rand Corporation looked at 11-thousand students in 62 schools with the personalized learning approach. It found those students “made gains in mathematics and reading that were significantly greater” than their peers in regular schools. JOANNE JENNINGS: For example, during the past two school years, they gained 11 percentile points in math tests. Larry Cuban is a former teacher, public school administrator, and Stanford School of Education Professor. He warns that past efforts to individualize instruction have fallen short of expectations. LARRY CUBAN: I’m allergic to over-promising. I’m allergic to exaggeration, because I’ve been in schools for a large part of my life, and I still go to schools. What I want is realistic, evidence-based kinds of things that know the history of these efforts and why they flop before, so you can have a much smarter approach to reforming schools, to improve what goes on in classrooms. JOANNE JENNINGS: Next year AltSchool plans to open its first school in Chicago and another in New York. And expand further by partnering with other private schools. Eventually, the goal is to license its software to public schools, a potential money maker that’s helped attract 133 million dollars in funding from investors. JOANNE JENNINGS: Why should they invest in Alt school? What kind of return are they going to get on their investment? MAX VENTILA: They are looking over the very long term. So they are saying, “If this is successful in 15 years, then it can achieve a kind of critical mass. The beauty of that is, it costs a lot to build the first one, but then it’s very, very cheap to build the 2nd one, and the thousandth one, and 10 thousandth one. JOANNE JENNINGS: With an annual tuition starting at 26-thousand dollars, relatively small class sizes, and only 450 students enrolled in its eight AltSchools. Larry Cuban is skeptical the methods honed here can be easily applied to large public schools with the greatest needs. LARRY CUBAN: That does not make it an easy model for altering or transforming public schools which have a different demography, both in students and teachers. When you have a public school system, in this case of 50 million kids, 3 million teachers, you have a great deal of variation. MAX VENTILLA: I think you need to start with an idealized environment if you’re trying to do something really transformatively different. How do you end up in an education future where the people with resources are actually getting the same experience that people with far less resources have? I just have this naïve belief that technology is an essential ingredient in that. SHARE ON FACEBOOK SHARE ON TWITTER SHARE VIA TEXT Editors' Picks silicon valley Are you aware of our comment policy?

A little less than a decade later, dozens of self-driving startups have cropped up while automakers around the world clamor, wallet in hand, to secure their place in the fast-moving world of fully automated transportation. And these companies are hungry for talent and skill sets many don't have. “Uber has just bought a half-a-year-old company [Otto] with 70 employees for almost $700 million,” Thrun said. “If you look at GM, they spent $1 billion on its acquisition of Cruise. These are mostly talent acquisitions. The going rate for talent these days is $10 million.” Thrun means per person, a lofty number which is likely to be getting even larger with time and even more demand. Now, the man dubbed by some as the “father of self-driving cars” wants to help see what he started at Google all the way through. “I’m surrounded by companies that are desperate for talent,” said Thrun. “Non-traditional players are joining the field and they’re all building substantial teams. But the skill set to build a self-driving car is a multidisciplinary skill set [and] that broad skill set is just not there.” Thrun, who left the search giant in 2014, and the team at Udacity is now working with Didi Chuxing, Mercedes-Benz, Nvidia and Otto to architect a self-driving “nanodegree” program. Udacity, which Thrun founded in 2012, offers higher education programs that it creates alongside its partners. Udacity’s partnership comes at a time that even more companies are beginning to launch their own self-driving pilots. Uber and Volvo started testing their self-driving vehicles in Pittsburgh. NuTonomy is testing its self-driving ride-hail service in Singapore. By 2020, there will be at least 10 players publicly experimenting with self-driving technology. It’s why Tesla, Google, Apple and Faraday Future are constantly poaching engineers from each other and why Uber ransacked Carnegie Mellon’s famed robotics lab. There simply aren’t enough people who are equipped with the knowledge and skills required to automate a vehicle. In fact, the only machine learning program in the world, according to Thrun, is at Carnegie Mellon, which still isn’t churning out talent fast enough to meet the industry’s demand. “It’s a very simple instance of a law that is fundamentally true: Technology is moving so fast, that by definition when something becomes hot, the skill set doesn’t exist,” Thrun said. While Udacity’s program is not formally accredited — it’s affordable enough that people would not necessarily need government loans — the program aims to equip its students with the specific credentials the company they want to work at requires. And there’s a full money-back guarantee, if you don’t find a job. In collaboration with its four partners, Udacity crafted the curriculum for the self-driving program around one single question: What would it take for these graduates to get a job at one of the partnering companies? The “professors,” who are either Udacity staff or are experts from partnering companies, work together to create projects for the Udacity students to work on. One project the students will be working on will require them to work with and build automated technology on a Udacity car. In a matter of nine months, a new pool of self-driving talent is born. Since opening the applications for the self-driving program on Tuesday, Udacity has gotten 4,000 applicants. The company is only admitting 250 students to start but will expand the program in the future. Thrun estimated that the tech industry alone is in need of about 5,000 engineers. All regions considered, from Detroit to Germany to Japan, Thrun said companies may be in need of something on the order of 20,000 engineers. In a sense, it’s a new problem for the auto industry. Axel Gern, Mercedes Benz head of autonomous driving in North America, has been working on automation for 18 years. In that time, he said, he hasn’t seen as much demand for self-driving technology talent as he has in the past two years. “There’s a huge hype around autonomous driving. There are many competitors in the field,” Gern told Recode in an interview. “But the number of people you can hire right out of university who are being educated in the field are limited. You’re looking for experts in computer vision, robotics, intelligent systems, artificial intelligence and so on.” But, for tech it’s an ongoing issue. Thrun sees an opportunity to continue programs like this as new and unseen technologies become more popular — from drones, which much of the self-driving program’s teachings could be applied to, to virtual and augmented reality. “The big secret behind this is the top-tier colleges only let in a small number of competent people,” Thrun said. ‘"There are so many other competent people. This program is for those people.’ recode_divider Next Up In Google Watch a supercut of Google’s event announcing its Pixel phones, Home and Daydream VR headset Google's hardware event was really all about its AI software Liveblog of Google’s hardware event Google's hardware chief says the Pixel will hold its own against the iPhone Google tailored its fabric Daydream headset for VR first-timers Trending Google’s Diane Greene says the singularity won’t arrive in her sentient lifetime No satire: The stars of HBO’s ‘Silicon Valley’ say they got ‘cucked’ in an LA bar News Corp, the New York Times and Axel Springer are backing Scroll, a subscription service from the former CEO of Chartbeat Marc Benioff says companies buy each other for the data, and the government isn’t doing anything about it The meeting that made Marc Benioff run away from a deal with Microsoft More in Trending Newsletters Recode Daily Top stories of the day.

TechShout Gadgets Software Hardware Mobile Phones Internet Apple Features Everything Else Home Mobile Phones Aadhar-ready phones embraced by Micromax, Intex; resisted by Apple, Google Mobile Phones Aadhar-ready phones embraced by Micromax, Intex; resisted by Apple, Google By Bindu Nair - Apple and Google may soon find themselves left behind by the likes of domestic manufacturers like Micromax and Lava when it comes to making their smartphones Aadhaar-ready. The former two are apparently resistant to the idea of adding the biometric authentication technology to their offerings. To recap, talk about Aadhaar-enabled devices first sprung up back in July this year. The Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) had called for a meeting attended by senior executives of companies like Google, Apple, Microsoft, Micromax and Samsung. The purpose of the gathering was to discuss the possibility of embedding the system so that people could authenticate their Aadhaar biometrics on the smartphone itself. This may have a number of advantages for citizens since they would be able to access various services without having to go to any office. Also Read: Supreme Court blasts Google, Yahoo, Microsoft over sex determination test ads People familiar with the discussions assert that Apple and Google are against the idea since it would involve opening up their system, which in turn might lead to hacking. The former is known for its rigid stance when it comes to privacy, having been involved in a long-drawn standout against the US government when the FBI asked it to unlock an alleged terrorist’s iPhone earlier this year. On the other hand, Micromax, Lava, Intex and Reliance’s Lyf brand are open to the initiative and have supposedly started discussions with Delta ID Inc to add the firm’s iris-reading tech to its products. This comes via its CEO Salil Prabhakar who also added that a few Chinese manufacturers like Vivo, Oppo and Gionee were looking into the possibility as well. Making phones Aadhar-ready would allow people to verify their identity by simply glancing at a handset with a special Iris camera. So far, only Samsung has produced a tablet which is compatible with the system.

In August 2015, Google Street View captured images along the banks of the River Cam, in Cambridge, England. As the cameras snapped their way through a meadow called Coe Fen, a cow crossed the road. Google apparently decided it would behoove it to add an identity-protecting blur. That is to say — the cow beside the Cam in Coe Fen was caught on camera, incognito. When an editor at The Guardian found the blurred face this week, he took a screenshot and shared it on Twitter, much to the Internet's delight. A spokesperson for Google told NPR that the act of bovine privacy protection was due to an overactive automated system. Here's Google's statement in full: "We thought you were pulling the udder one when we herd the moos, but it's clear that our automatic face-blurring technology has been a little overzealous. "Of course, we don't begrudge this cow milking its five minutes of fame." ("Pull the other one," as Monty Python fans might remember, is a Britishism akin to "you're pulling my leg.") According to Google's privacy policy, that technology "is designed to blur all identifiable faces and license plates within Google-contributed imagery," and people can request that their entire house or car be blurred. Once Google blurs an image, it's permanent, the company says. The Guardian notes this is not the first time an animal's face has been concealed out of beefed-up privacy concerns — earlier this year, West Midlands police blurred the faces of three stolen lambs. And Slate points out that, according to some researchers, face-blurring is a load of bull anyway. Software can be trained to see through such efforts to conceal identities, the researchers say. In the case of the cow at Coe Fen, it's substantially easier to uncover the would-be concealed identity. Just back up one step along the path in Google Street View, embedded above, and all will be revealed. Copyright 2016 NPR.

At this point in time, we are quite certain that the latter will produce and out two smartphones for Google this year, originally codenamed Sailfish and Marlin. Beyond that, however, we know little details about the pair. Even the Nexus branding seems uncertain, as more and more rumors are hinting at a new Pixel moniker. A few days ago, the Nexus launcher was officially rebranded to match said title, so, we feel fairly confident when assuming the Pixel and Pixel XL are the two devices we have to look forward to. Pixel XL/Marlin front panel As for design, we do already have a few renders to go by, but nothing really clear along the line of live shots. However, a new source has now provided a few high-res photos of what are said to be the front panels of the two devices. These do also come with measurements. The smaller, dubbed "S1" measures 4.99 inches in diagonal, while the bigger, "M1" is 5.46 inches. This does mostly coincide with previous specs rumors and the source in question is a parts dealer in Hong Kong, with a good track record when it comes to leaks. Pixel XL/Marlin front panel in white Screen size aside, we can see that HTC has gone for a quite clean design. Some highlights include a central cutout for the light and proximity sensors, right beneath the earpiece, a single front-facing snapper and and empty bottom bezel - in tune with Google's typical on-screen control scheme. As for other specs, we currently believe the 5-inch Pixel or Sailfish phone will have a resolution of 1080p, Snapdragon 820 SoC, 4GB of RAM and 32 or 128GB of on-board storage. The camera setup is said to consist of a 12MP rear snapper and an 8MP selfie one. We can also expect a USB Type-C port, a fingerprint scanner on the back, bottom-firing speakers, all the usual connectivity options including Bluetooth 4.2, and a 2,770 mAh battery. Pixel /Sailfish front panel Most of these specs will likely be shared with the bigger Pixel XL or Marlin, except for the already mentioned 5.5 or so inch display, likely with QHD resolution. The chipset might also get a bump up to the Snapdragon 821 and rumors put the battery at 3,450 mAh.

Weather Your 4-day local weather forecast Thursday November 17, 2016 News National Larger / SmallerNight Mode Big business muscles into schools Timna Jacks and Henrietta Cook 18 Sep 2016, 12:52 p.m. It's a trend that no one is monitoring, and it's benefiting some of the largest companies in the world. Big business muscles into schools Business lessons: critics fear big brands are muscling into schools. Photo: Jamieson Murphy Tweet Facebook of ╳ exit It's a trend no one is monitoring, and it's benefiting some of the largest companies in the world. Businesses are infiltrating Victorian schools to spruik technology, energy drinks and cars to a captive young audience. Fairfax Media understands the Victorian Education Department does not track businesses' involvement with schools. But critics say tougher rules are needed to ensure school lessons and teachers' independence are not compromised by commercial pressures. Major technology companies have gained access to schools under pressure to create technology oriented classrooms. Microsoft, Apple and Google provide training, accreditation and awards to Victorian teachers, who in turn promote the products in schools and on social media. The companies are also creeping into classrooms as they compete to teach a new generation of students to code, a new requirement for students around the world, including for Victorian students by 2017. Apple's coding curriculum for teachers is expected to be adopted in many schools, as well as its new educational coding app, Swift Playgrounds, which will compete with Google's popular project, Scratch. But technology companies are not alone in their bid to access students. Multivitamins group Swisse, Medibank Private, Telstra and Transfield Holdings have either sponsored school events, or developed marketing programs and work placements for students. Feminine hygiene product company Libra runs a year 6 and 7 education program called "I am changing". (The company provides free resource kits to schools with tampons and sanitary pads.) Last month, Mazda handed out a show bag stuffed with a Mazda monopoly game, pens and drink bottles to 70 year 10 Shelford Girls Grammar students after a car maintenance lesson. Principal Polly Flanagan said the session was "purely educational". "No one said you have to buy a Mazda car," she said. "It was instructive." Mazda's senior manager of service training Michael Thompson said the session was not about self-promotion, but conceded he wasn't shying away from an opportunity to harness "customer loyalty". High school students are being hired as "brand ambassadors" to talk up products to their friends at parties and on social media. Year 13, a company that has worked with Virgin Money Australia, Student Flights and Red Bull, is advertising a job for a high school brand ambassador who "has a way with words and ... can run their mouth with their friends and over social media". Co-founder Will Stubley said the ambassadors did not work in schools, and it was a good opportunity for them to gain valuable work experience and money. "As an overarching policy, we say, if you do want to distribute materials in schools, make sure you check with teachers and parents first." Paul Harrison, a senior lecturer at Deakin University, said advertising had no place in schools. He said school councils were often "quite naive" about companies wanting to be involved in schools, and undervalued their promotional capacity. "The reason corporations are in schools is because they know there is money to be made. "I think it is a clash of objectives: you have schools whose responsibility is to create critical thinkers, but they are buying into a corporate mentality." Greens spokeswoman for education Sue Pennicuik called for stricter rules around businesses in schools. "It's not just an altruistic act," she said. She said many schools were allowing companies in because they were underfunded. "They shouldn't have to rely on companies to deliver programs and provide services," she said. Steve Brophy, Ivanhoe Grammar School's e-learning co-ordinator who received a Microsoft award this year, said he was not obliged to promote or use Microsoft products, adding that his school's primary students used the Apple iPad. Mr Brophy, who used Microsoft's OneNote program with year 7 students while creating a 3D printing replica of the school, said new technology added substantial value in the classroom. "Schools are savvy enough to have processes around this. For us, we don't feel they sell us anything. We make rational decisions based on the needs of our kids." The Victorian Education Department's policy states that schools should enter partnerships with businesses only if they can "demonstrate a contribution to improve learning". A spokesman said the business community offered "considerable benefits for students and schools" by boosting science, technology, engineering and maths (STEM) skills and connecting students to local industry. Apple, Microsoft and Swisse did not provide comment to Fairfax Media by deadline. The story Big business muscles into schools first appeared on The Age.

Downing hung up a deep cross towards the far post, where Stekelenburg was in the process of catching it when Negredo powered through and headed the ball into the net. Actually, I think it’s an own goal because Negredo seemed to knock Stekelenburg’s arm, which knocked the ball out of his hands and into the net.

Sometimes, a player’s weakness becomes his strength as a manager: think of George Graham and Glenn Hoddle, swaggering midfielders and magnificent defensive coaches, or hard-faced centre-back Tony Mowbray preaching tiki-taka in the Midlands. Ronald Koeman and Aitor Karanka, whose Everton and Middlesbrough sides meet at Goodison Park today, took their playing strengths with them when they went into management: both were defenders (well, nominally in Koeman’s case) and both know exactly what to do with a bank of four. Both teams are not without attacking flair, but defence will be the key to whether their achieve their ambitions this season. Middlesbrough will be happy to stay up; Everton, who are currently the closest of the also-rans to the champions Manchester City, are aiming for Europe. Kick off is at 5.30pm.

Social media will play a key role in increasing accessibility to online trends, viewer engagement and data analytics during the upcoming presidential debate.   - GASTON DE CARDENAS/AFP/Getty Images The nonpartisan Commission on Presidential Debates has a new media partner — social media. The commission has announced that it will work with Facebook, Google, Snapchat and Microsoft to provide data from social media networks to the debate moderators, and to enhance viewer engagement and online research. Facebook and Google will provide analytics to the moderators in advance of the debates on trending search topics, likes, re-posts, etc. In an email, Facebook said the new effort will help provide input from more diverse voices in the political process. Analyst Jack Myers at MediaVillage agreed and said the increased involvement of social media companies in the debates is long overdue. “It’s like taking the temperature of the population,” Myers said. “Social media will give the moderators a better sense of what’s capturing public opinion among different groups.” Especially, he said, among young people — who conduct a lot of their social lives online and whose opinions are notoriously difficult to survey through traditional polling. There is a less-elevating possibility, said Princeton University political historian Julian Zelizer: “It can create a much more chaotic and ugly debate, because what’s out there in the social media’s not always pretty. So some of the questions and some of the issues that come from the public might actually diminish the quality of the debate.” For instance, Google has just launched a new site that aggregates search-topic trends for each presidential candidate. Today it reported that among the top-ranked were “Jimmy Fallon” and “Trump hair.” That was a follow on media buzz from Donald Trump’s appearance on the Tonight Show the night before, during which host Jimmy Fallon asked Trump: “Can I mess your hair up?” Karlyn Bowman, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, said that what generates the most social-media traffic is typically whatever the mainstream media has hyped most heavily over the past 24 hours. Recently, that might have been birtherism, Benghazi, tacos or emails. But, she said, “the economy, terrorism and health care are the top three issues when people are asked to volunteer the issues that are most important to them, that they want to hear the presidential candidates address.” Follow Mitchell Hartman at @entrepreneurguy.  Mitchell Hartman Mitchell Hartman is the senior reporter for Marketplace’s Entrepreneurship Desk and also covers employment.

(AP Photo/Elise Amendola) Share Written by Alice Truong September 17, 2016 In 2008, Google began blurring people’s faces in Street View, a component of Google Maps that shows panoramic imagery of streets, to protect their privacy. Apparently, the search giant is serious about bovine privacy too. This week, an anonymous cow caused quite a stir after its face was blurred by Google. David Shariatmadari, an editor at the Guardian, stumbled on the Street View image, which was taken in a semi-rural part of Cambridge in the UK. He shared it on Twitter, where it’s amassed more than 11,000 retweets. Great to see Google takes cow privacy seriously pic.twitter.com/ACTBpDwno6 — David Shariatmadari (@D_Shariatmadari) September 13, 2016 In a pun-filled statement to the BBC, Google admitted its face-blurring technology may have been “a little overzealous.” A spokesman added: “Of course, we don’t begrudge this cow milking its five minutes of fame.” Read full story home our picks popular latest obsessions search

Just when things were about to settle, and you were done with your discounts and sales, Google decided to let you have the last bite of assortments. The biggest online shopping festival powered by Google is finally here. The Great Online Shopping Festival is expected to be held in last week of September. The festival is going to be the second of its kind and is expected to garner the same amount of support and popularity as it did last year in 2015. Why GOSF Chose Pakistan? A relatively smaller e-industry as compared to adversaries in the region, the Pakistani e-commerce sector is having mushroom growth with estimates pointing to numbers that have doubled in the last few years. The e-industry in Pakistan is expected to close at PKR 65 million, 85% more than 2015. Forecast for 2017 is calculated around PKR 130 million, double than that of 2016. With such staggering figures, events like GOSF are to boost the already fertile environment further. Involvement of both local and foreign investors have further ripened the industry, and such events help the buyers get the best of deals. The first edition in Pakistan was held in 2015 and was participated in by all local online ventures including the then biggest online shopping store. The Goal of Google’s GOSF This Year Things are all set to go north this year with more than 50 leading sellers and online shopping stores already committing for the event. This also includes leading e-commerce, local and online vendors, brands, retail outlets, FMCG, CPG, and BFSI. The three-day long event is aiming to attract more than 5 million visitors and promises to deliver around 20,000 orders through both discounts and interactive games helping you win free items as well. The participants come from all categories with a clear dominance of both fashion and appliances as usual. With a similar approach of helping vendors and sellers manage dedicated landing pages, just like last year, Google is all set to bring record sales. Jambo.pk – The Game Changer Pakistan’s only online shopping startup, Jambo.pk is all set to make its debut in the shopping festival. Having an inventory stocked up with more than 20,000 SKUs, Jambo.pk is definitely to be the game-changer in this year’s great online shopping festival. The youngest of the online shopping store in Pakistan, Jambo.pk started in early 2016 and has achieved unprecedented growth in a very short span of time. Covering niches from apparel to electronic, Jambo.pk is your one window shopping solution for all the needs.

With zero tolerance for fakes and replicas, the outlet is delivering quality and original products nationwide. The broad category range helps the visitors in easily discovering his or her requirement and easy ordering procedures help you save both time and money. With Jambo.pk’s involvement in GOSF Pakistan 2016 – things are definitely to favour buyers. We advise you to save as hard as you can because you may never know if this is your chance to get the latest Samsung Galaxy Note 7 price in the price of Galaxy Note 6.

Courtesy Google On Google Earth, nobody knows you’re a cow National Editorial September 17, 2016 Updated: September 17, 2016 05:29 PM Related Snap goes privacy With technology tracking our online activities all the time, it’s easy to think that digital privacy is a thing of the past. But Google recently showed it takes this issue so seriously that it even protects the identities of animals. Or at least that is one interpretation of why a cow grazing on the banks of the River Cam in Cambridge, England, shows up in Google Street View with its face blurred. Other cows along the river did not have their faces blurred, which raises the question about what was so special about this animal. While this is obviously an error by Google’s face-blurring computer algorithm, the incident is a reminder of how much information is out there and how the world is being mapped. It’s also proof that even with an image database as massive as Street View’s to learn from, the algorithms still aren’t perfect. In this particular case, it was probably a decision to protect the identity of this cow that was running away from the "moo-fia".

 This one illustration made the entire Google Doodle team cry Avery Hartmans Sep. 17, 2016, 9:00 AM 13,792 facebook linkedin twitter email print Sabrina Brady, the student artist who won the Doodle 4 Google contest in 2013. Peter Kramer/NBC/NBC NewsWire via Getty Images There wasn't a dry eye in the room when the Google Doodle team first saw Sabrina Brady's illustration in 2013. "It was a Doodle about her best day ever, and it was the day her father came back from military duty," Ryan Germick, the head of Google Doodle, told Business Insider. "It was a really touching Doodle and tears were just pouring out of everyone’s eyes." Brady's design, called "Coming Home," won the contest that year. The theme, "My Best Day Ever..." elicited 130,000 submissions. Brady's drawing told the story of her dad coming home after being deployed in Iraq for 18 months. Germick said that emotional connection is what he looks for in Doodles, first and foremost. "One thing that’s really nice is that this is not about having the most incredible rendering skills and being able to draw super 3D effects," Germick told Business Insider. "This is about being able to express your humanity and your individual interests and passions through a piece of artwork." Sabrina Brady's Google Doodle, called "Coming Home." Google Google's annual contest, Doodle 4 Google, kicked off Wednesday and submissions have likely already started pouring in. This year's theme will be "What I see for the future..." and the winner will receive an array of big prizes, like a $30,000 college scholarship and a trip to Google to meet the Doodle team.  SEE ALSO: The head of Google Doodle says he sees 'Google' in everything SEE ALSO: The head of Google Doodle explains how to win this year’s design contest NOW WATCH: A hacker reveals a simple way to come up with a strong password that's easy to remember Loading video...

Steve Marcus/AP/File View Caption About video ads View Caption of Over the last five years, much has been written about autonomous-car efforts from Apple and Google. Could these two massively successful Silicon Valley startups overturn the established order in the global auto industry? The answer remains to be seen, but this month brought news that both companies are restructuring their efforts. Recommended: How much do you know about the auto industry's future? Apple has laid off a significant number of staff in a "reset" of its automotive Project Titan (an effort it's never formally acknowledged), according to reports by company followers. Test your knowledge How much do you know about the auto industry's future? Photos of the Day Photos of the Day 11/16 And Google has seen a longtime autonomous-vehicle researcher depart even as auto companies have launched incremental steps toward self-driving capabilities. Now, General Motors has weighed in with a suggestion that its 2017 Chevrolet Bolt EV electric car shows it can compete effectively with Silicon Valley. At last week's Citi Global Technology Conference in New York City, GM's executive chief engineer for electric vehicles, Pam Fletcher, discussed the role of the all-electric five-door hatchback. Rated at 238 miles of range by the EPA last week, the 2017 Bolt EV will enter production later this year and go on sale in initial markets, very likely in California. "Fletcher suggests the Bolt epitomizes GM’s metamorphosis,"  summarized trade publication Ward's Auto, "from an old-line manufacturing goliath into a Silicon Valley-like developer and builder of highly connected products and new mobility services, such as EVs, car-sharing, ride-sharing and ride-hailing." Indeed, the all-electric Bolt offers the highest rated range of any electric car that doesn't have a Tesla badge on it, at a starting price of $37,500. That's far lower than the luxury sedans and crossover utility vehicles now offered by Silicon Valley startup automaker Tesla Motors; they start at $70,000 and rise into six figures. That company has received almost 400,000 deposits of $1,000 apiece from potential buyers of its upcoming $35,000 Model 3, offering 215 miles of range. But that car is still a year away—and perhaps longer. GM clearly perceives Tesla and its sales of 100,000 or more electric cars as a serious threat. But the Bolt EV's role goes well beyond simply beating Tesla to the punch with an affordable longer-range electric car. Indeed, the car will be the testbed for autonomous driving technologies and likely ubiquitous in its Maven car-sharing service, and the Lyft ride-hailing program GM has invested in. General Motors also bought Cruise Automation, whose self-driving technologies will almost surely be tested in the Bolt EV. As Ward's notes, "The Bolt fits perfectly into those mobility services spaces, Fletcher says, because it seats five people comfortably, offers lots of cargo space for weekenders and day trippers, its footprint is relatively small and its smooth, quiet electric propulsion is ideal for urban areas." GM frequently uses the word "urban" to describe the Bolt EV and its likely uses, with its Volt plug-in hybrid hatchback assigned the role of long-distance transport for plug-in owners. The company said in January it has no plans to fund the installation of any DC fast-charging infrastructure that would permit the Bolt EV or any other all-electric vehicle to be used on long Interstate road trips. The Tesla Supercharger network of fast-charging sites operating at up to 150 kilowatts, on the other hand, provides a model for such a network. To date, however, the U.S. and German makers that have united behind the Combined Charging Standard (CCS) fast-charging protocols and hardware have shown no convincing plan for a network that would provide a similar capability. GM appears to be choosing which parts of Silicon Valley's automotive innovation it chooses to compete with—and which it prefers to ignore.

Bloomberg photo by Andrew Harrer   Chris Lynch, director of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's Defense Digital Service, in his office at the Pentagon in Arlington, Va., on Aug. 23, 2016. Bloomberg photo bgy Andrew Harrer   Nafeesa Syeed Bloomberg     Chris Lynch is easy to spot walking the Pentagon's sprawling corridors: He's the guy wearing a hoodie and sneakers amid all the crisp military uniforms. Instead of a placard with his name, the sign outside the office he leads says "Rebel Alliance." With its open rows of Apple computers, whiteboards and "Star Wars" imagery lining the walls, Lynch's free-flow work space at the Pentagon's Defense Digital Service would be familiar to Silicon Valley programmers. But it's atypical for federal agencies, and that's the point. "It's the fight against the bureaucracy," said Lynch, 40, who founded several technology startups. "How do we think of new approaches to things that in some ways have remained unchanged for very long?" While the Defense Department has to fend off North Korean and Russian hackers and counter Islamic State recruiters online, it also has to process personnel requests, travel vouchers and job applications more efficiently. Defense Secretary Ash Carter has vowed to yank the Pentagon fully into the 21st century -- moving increasingly toward cloud services, modernizing computer systems and adding more mobile products. Lynch, whose office reports directly to Carter, helps make that happen. Part of Lynch's new approach meant landing Matt Cutts, a 15-year veteran at Google who, as the head of the company's web spam team, had the power to help determine whether companies flourished or floundered by tweaking the algorithm behind online search results. Cutts' role at Google -- he's now on leave -- was important enough to the world of webmasters, public relations specialists and computer engineers that he attracted 516,000 followers on Twitter, 80,000 more than Vladimir Putin's English feed. "I did take a pay cut but that's OK, because where else do you get a chance to have an impact like this?" the 44-year-old said. Since it's the Pentagon, not everything Cutts and Lynch do can even be discussed publicly. But among the DDS's unclassified projects is a review of problems affecting the new ground-control system for the next generation of GPS satellites as well as veterans' health-care records and the Defense Department's travel system. With their set pay scales and buttoned-down culture, the Pentagon and other public agencies must compete for talent with tech companies offering lucrative salaries and laid-back work environments. Their longer hiring process is also a turnoff. And then there's the broad distrust of Washington in Silicon Valley after Edward Snowden's revelations about government surveillance and the FBI's unresolved fight with Apple over encryption. FBI Director James Comey said his daughter encapsulated the government's problems in recruiting, describing his role as "The Man." "And I thought that was a compliment so I said, 'Thank you,'" Comey told attendees at a Symantec Corp. cybersecurity conference Aug. 30. "And she said, 'Dad, I don't mean that in a good way. I mean you're The Man. Who would want to work for The Man?"' It all adds up to a high hurdle for the feds. "Federal agencies' lack of cybersecurity and IT talent is a major resource constraint that impacts their ability to protect information and assets," U.S. Chief Information Officer Tony Scott and other Obama administration officials said in a July statement. Some of that shortfall starts with the paycheck. Cybersecurity and information technology workers usually enter the federal government at salaries from $53,000 to $84,000, according to the Office of Personnel Management. That compares with average cybersecurity salaries of $116,000 at Google and $140,000 at Facebook, according to Glassdoor Inc., which tracks company pay. Plus, companies offer additional perks, from free snacks to stock options. The U.S. Digital Service, which brings in technologists for short-term programs at federal agencies, points out to recruits that federal salaries are capped at $160,300. "Sooner or later the federal government, if they're going to get people, they're going to have to pay higher salaries," said Martin Libicki, a senior management scientist at Rand Corp. who wrote a report on the cyber workforce. "But that means more taxpayer money." The demand for cybersecurity professionals began to overtake supply in 2007, and the shortage is primarily among those with high-end skills, who can fetch salaries of $200,000 to $250,000, according to Libicki. Some federal agencies are better off than others. The CIA, NSA and FBI as well as other military and law enforcement agencies tend to have an advantage because of the prestige associated with their brands, analysts say. It's more challenging for some civilian agencies as "their mission might not be that sexy," Shawn Henry, a former FBI executive who is now chief security officer and president of services at CrowdStrike Inc. Two years ago, the government was a "scary black box" for Phaedra Chrousos, 34, who founded and sold two startups in New York. The MBA graduate took a chance and joined the General Services Administration after being courted by friends in the government, eventually serving a stint as the commissioner for its Technology Transformation Service. "There's tremendous misconception outside of the government when you're coming in," Chrousos said in an interview. "I was told, 'I can't believe you're entering the government. Do you think you'll get anything done?"' To help fill the 10,000 cybersecurity jobs the Office of Personnel Management says are needed in the next few years, the White House says the federal government hopes to employ an additional 3,500 more people for cyber and IT positions by this January. It's also proposed spending $62 million in 2017 to expand cybersecurity education, including scholarships to college students. Some agencies are trying to tackle the dearth by going to the source, setting up outposts in Silicon Valley and testing short-term programs to give outsiders a taste of government cyber work. The Department of Homeland Security lets companies "loan" an executive for as long as a year as an unpaid agency employee. On Capitol Hill, Travis Moore was struck by the lack of tech expertise while working as the legislative director for former representative Henry Waxman, a Democrat from California. Moore created TechCongress, a nonprofit that started a nine-month fellowship this year, paying a pair of technologists $70,000 stipends to work on technology policy in Congress. "There's a belief in Silicon Valley, 'if only we could get smart people in the government like us we could solve it all,"' Moore said. "It's a lot more complicated than that." Cutts had a rough start on his first day at the Pentagon's DDS, as staff hustled to find him a computer. But he praised the office and other opportunities that are sprouting throughout the federal government. "There's a third path now," he said. "It used to be academia or industry, and in the last two or three years there's a much clearer path to serving your country and joining government and that is new."

Rosanna Philpott reports ▲ Hide Transcript ▶ View Transcript Queuing for museums is an old school activity. But now you can see most of it online from the comfort of your bed.. Google's arts and culture project was originally launched as a way to see fine art online, now they're branching into science... (SOUNDBITE) (English) ROSANNA PHILPOTT, REUTERS REPORTER, SAYING: "I'm in London's Natural History Museum, and even if you're half way across the world you can be too - using this - now your smart phone, tablet or any computer can bring go back 4.6 billion years into natural history" The project essentially forms an enormous data base from 60 different natural history museums from across the world. But it's also designed to be an immersive virtual experience... like a 360 museum style google street view. UPSOT using 360 film You can walk down museum halls and have a look at the exhibits. And videos have been fleshed out to bring extinct animals to life. UPSOT using 360 film (SOUNDBITE) (English) DIRECTOR OF GOOGLE'S CULTURAL INSTITUTE AND ART PROJECT, AMIT SOOD, SAYING: "You could be a kid sitting in Bombay you could be sitting wherever you like and you actually take a walk through the Hinsei Hall in the Natural History Museum, then pop to the Natural History Museum in Belgium seeing the largest dinosaur hall." Some may argue going online and fancy gadgets could never replace the real museum experience. If you were a real natural history super fan, you could considering doing both simultaneously.

In August, less than a year after auto industry veteran John Krafcik took the helm of Google's self-driving car project, Urmson left. Bloomberg photo by Drew Angerer   Alistair Barr Bloomberg     Chris Urmson, the mild-mannered robotics expert who ran Google's self-driving car project, used to say that when his son reached driving age in 2019 the technology would be available so the teenager wouldn't have to take a driving test. In August, less than a year after auto industry veteran John Krafcik took the helm of the project, Urmson left with much work remaining: Google has yet to launch an autonomous vehicle service for the public. Other top technologists have also departed and progress has been slow. Once considered a leader in the field, Google has lost its first-mover advantage to other companies pursuing more practical, less-ambitious self-driving car services, said former members of the project and other people familiar with the situation. They asked not to be identified because details of the effort are private. "They need a partner, a sales force, a strategy," said Roger Lanctot, associate director of Strategy Analytics' Global Automotive Practice. Google's project started in 2009, long before carmakers and most other companies seriously considered the technology. But when Singapore unveiled the first autonomous taxi service in August, Google wasn't involved. Instead, a small startup called nuTonomy provided the technology. Uber Technologies Inc., founded in 2009, will soon let users of its popular ride-sharing app hail autonomous Volvo SUVs in Pittsburgh. Google has driven more than 1.8 million miles in tests on public roads in a bid to perfect its software to handle difficult situations, such as driving in snow. Tesla Motors already offers partially autonomous features in more than 70,000 of its electric cars, and Otto, a startup run by former Google car project members, is developing a self-driving system for trucks on highways, an easier technological challenge than the one Google faces. Uber acquired Otto in July. "Google still has an imperfect system and no clear path to go to market," said Ajay Juneja, chief executive officer of Speak With Me Inc., which offers voice recognition and related technology for cars, watches and other connected devices. "How exactly would they have shipped something by now?" This is part of a broader challenge Google parent Alphabet Inc. faces turning research projects into profitable businesses. The company is more cautious about rolling out new technology early, after its Glass internet-connected eye wear flopped, according to one of the people. There's also a higher bar now for projects as Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat has said she requires clearer paths to profitability before approving more funding or expansion. Possibly the biggest drag on program is the sheer scope of Google's ambitions. Its aim is to revolutionize transportation through full autonomy. The software must be trained thoroughly to handle all eventualities. Meanwhile, there are already methods to make self-driving cars good, rather than perfect. That has helped companies including Uber, Daimler's Mercedes-Benz, Tesla and Volvo Car Group catch up with Google, Juneja said. Uber's service, which is tied to the smartphones of drivers and passengers, can generate a lot more driving data, an essential ingredient to quickly train the artificial intelligence software needed to guide self-driving vehicles, Morgan Stanley analysts said in a recent research note. "Uber logs as many miles in 24 minutes as Google's autonomous cars have logged in their existence," they wrote. "While none of these miles are fully autonomous today, we just point out the scale of experience that can accelerate the development of the AI, mapping and learning for autonomous cars." Tesla, with thousands of internet-connected cars on the road, has a similar data advantage, one former member of the Google car project said. The two main ways for Google to commercialize the technology are by including Chauffeur, the name for its self-driving software, in cars made in high volume by existing auto manufacturers, or through a popular ride-sharing service that could slowly replace a human-driven fleet with automated vehicles, industry experts said. Google has neither of these yet. It struck a deal in May with Fiat Chrysler, but only to put its software in 100 minivans. Talks with other car companies, such as Ford, have yet to produce high-volume deals. And many car companies are pursuing their own self-driving strategies. General Motors bought self-driving software startup Cruise Automation in March and invested $500 million in ride-sharing service Lyft Inc., gaining two important ingredients for an autonomous vehicle service. A Google unit invested in Uber in 2013, sparking speculation Google's self-driving software would automate Uber rides. But Uber is building its own autonomous technology now. Google is planning to expand a ride-sharing service built around its Waze navigation app, however that will only be in San Francisco later this year, while Uber and Lyft cover most major U.S. cities. "I think they'd rather enable than do," Lanctot, of Strategy Analytics, said. "As enabler, they can work with all, rather than become a competitive target." Slow progress caused frustration among some members of the Google car project, and that's been exacerbated by early momentum of rivals that entered the race later, according to former members of the team and a person familiar with the situation. The team knew what it would take to deliver a fully-autonomous system, known in the industry as L4, but some Google executives didn't understand the complexity, according to one former member of the project. The person left to help run an active business with paying customers, something that's missing from the car project. A Google spokesman declined to comment for this story. Several years ago, some on the team wanted to push ahead with a service that didn't require full automation, but Google co-founder Larry Page insisted on complete human driver replacement, another person said. Sebastian Thrun, the first head of the Google car project, left in 2014 to focus on his online education startup Udacity Inc. and develop flying cars with Page. In early 2016, Anthony Levandowski, one of the original engineers on the project, co-founded Otto. He started the company with Don Burnette, who wrote software for Google's self-driving car, Google robotics expert Claire Delaunay and Lior Ron, who worked on Google Maps and Android smartphones. Otto's goal is to "speed the adoption of self-driving technology," according to its website. Levandowski told The Wall Street Journal in May that it's easier to prove Otto's technology is better than humans on highways, where the tasks of driving are fairly straightforward, than in cities, which generate more complex driving situations. Levandowski declined to comment on why he left Google's project. When Urmson left in August, other project veterans Jiajun Zhu and Dave Ferguson also departed. One former member said the project is suffering from a "seven-year itch" as staff look for new challenges. Googlers like to see technology they work on influence as many people as possible, so it's been difficult to see the steady drumbeat of rival autonomous vehicle announcements while Google's project slogs through testing, this person said. The New York Times reported Urmson was unhappy with the direction of the project under new CEO Krafcik and that he quarreled with Page about it. Urmson told Bloomberg he wasn't frustrated with progress, but declined to say why he was unhappy. "I'm not willing to get into it," he wrote in a text message, adding that he's "extremely proud of both the team and of the work." Zhu said he and Ferguson left to put together a startup in artificial intelligence and robotics. "I joined the project 7.5 years ago when we were just a handful of engineers and look at where the whole industry is today," he wrote in an email. "It would have been much harder to leave if we weren't so confident in the strength of the team at Google." Another person familiar with the car project said Google still has the most experience in the field, and its technology is still the most advanced, despite the company's reluctance to use that advantage for practical routes to commercializing the technology, such as Otto's truck automation. Still, rolling out partial autonomous technology can be risky. Tesla's driver-assistance features, known as Autopilot, have been in the spotlight since a fatal crash in May. In 2012, Google let employees test a similar system for automated highway driving and discovered the attention of the human drivers quickly drifted, leaving them incapable of taking back control quickly and safely. That persuaded the company to pursue full autonomy, even if it took longer. "Full autonomy, although much harder, is the right route," Krafcik said in a recent interview with Bloomberg Businessweek. Google hasn't decided on a business model yet, Krafcik said in the July 18 interview. "Serious snow testing" is still to come, while it could be 20 to 25 years before most trips in cities will be provided by autonomous vehicles, he added. That's a stark contrast to Urmson's oft-quoted prediction about his son's driving test. During a recent text message exchange, he declined to say whether he's sticking with that forecast. "It's been a long time and it's time to see what else is out there," he said after news of his departure broke. One thing he did confirm: He has no plans to join Uber. --- Alex Webb and Keith Naughton continued.

Live feed Show 8.14am EDT 08:14 Final score - Sydney 18.10 (118) defeat Adelaide 12.10 (82) In the end, comfortable. Earlier, anything but. That was a proper final, both sides completely committed to the physical task. The Swans did it with 20 after losing McVeigh to a calf injury and Rohan a knee ailment that looked pretty nasty. That opened the door to Adelaide, who worked their way back into this contest in the third quarter, with four goals to two. But Sydney shut down any hope swiftly in the final term. Adelaide will lament how long it took to get into the game, all-too-regular skill errors taken advantage of by the hosts in the early stages. As the game went on, it was the big names: Kennedy (42 touches), Haneberry (31), Heeney (32), Franklin (four goals) - all outstanding. Then the work of the small forwards Papley (four goals) and McGlynn (three). All told, they overwhelmed the visitors. So after threatening for so long this season, Adelaide’s campaign is over at least a week earlier than what they would have considered satisfactory. For the victors, they return to the biggest venue of them all for a Friday night preliminary final against Geelong. And with that, I bid you farewell. Thanks for the company through the night.

The financial crisis and the bailouts that followed unleashed a wave of populist anger, targeting almost everyone with power, from Wall Street to government officials to elites more generally. Except in one sector: technology. Why has tech been spared the torches and pitchforks? Because everybody loves a winner. As the economy began to grow again in 2009, it had a new dominant force: the technology sector emerged from the financial crisis ready to thrive. Apple released both the iPhone 4 and the iPad in 2010, as fans made a ritual out of waiting for hours for new products on launch day. The Social Network was released in theatres later that year, cementing Facebooks place in the popular imagination. In May 2011, LinkedIn became the first high-profile technology company since the financial crisis to complete its initial public offering, and the stock doubled on its first day, a throwback to the dot-com bubble of the 90s. And in August of that year, Marc Andreessen, the venture capitalist and co-founder of Netscape, published an essay whose title became a catchphrase: Why software is eating the world. Tech had become the golden child of the post-crisis era, with San Francisco its new capital. Then came glory days for the tech sector. After an IPO stumble, Facebook cracked the code of mobile advertising and became a $350 billion company. Amazon rode the success of its Amazon Web Services cloud platform to a similar valuation. Apple and Alphabet, parent company of Google, jockeyed to become the most valuable company in the world. The rest of corporate America tried to adopt the language of tech, with words like disruption entering the popular lexicon. Chambers of commerce pitched their cities as the next Silicon Valley. General Electric advertised itself as a digital company rather than an industrial one. This growth has changed techs role in society. In 2010, the new tech boom may have been best defined by trivial consumer companies with smartphone apps like Groupon and Zynga, which offered coupons to yoga classes and a few minutes of gaming distraction. Todays tech titans are anything but trivial. Facebook, once a way to keep up with your friends, has evolved to be a dominant media platform for news and public opinion. Amazon has gone from dominating e-commerce to increasingly appearing like it will dominate commerce. Uber started out as a way for tech workers in San Francisco to hail black cars, but now aims to increase its market share for all ground transportation around the world. When companies become this important in society, their stumbles are judged harshly. In recent months Facebook has gotten in hot water with conservatives who saw a partisan bias in its human-curated trending news product, and with liberals for censoring the Pulitzer-winning Napalm Girl photograph from the Vietnam War. Some of Amazon and Googles services, like Prime Now and Google Fiber, have been implemented in dense and wealthy urban areas at the exclusion of less-wealthy and rural communities, raising questions of social equity and discrimination. Should Ubers market share grow to the extent that it becomes an essential service for communities, its ability to leave cities that resist it, as it did this year in Austin, would further the view of some that the company behaves like a bully. An equally disturbing trend in this generation of tech companies is the extent to which founders and executives have structured their firms to limit the power of shareholders and other outsiders. Facebook and Google both have created multiple classes of shares to ensure that key shareholders retain majority control of their companies. And, to be fair, investors who dont like this arrangement can choose simply not to own the stock. But should, say, Facebook make a unilateral unpopular move to censor a sensitive topic from its news feed to serve either its financial or ideological interests, a populist mob might scream: Mark Zuckerberg doesnt have the right to decide what a billion people can or cannot see. And they would be right. And what would happen then? Consider past examples. When Wall Street and the housing sector became the targets of populist anger, they faced fines and increased regulations. When government becomes a target, there is less political will for funding and broad powers. For the technology sector, wed likely see a combination of three things  fines for misbehaviour, increased regulation, and perhaps even federal action to break up perceived monopolists. Some have called the early 21st century a new Gilded Age. If it is, the next question is who will be to this era what Teddy Roosevelt was to the prior one: the peoples champion who broke the power of ruthless monopolists.

Social media will play a key role in increasing accessibility to online trends, viewer engagement and data analytics during the upcoming presidential debate.   - GASTON DE CARDENAS/AFP/Getty Images The nonpartisan Commission on Presidential Debates has a new media partner — social media. The commission has announced that it will work with Facebook, Google, Snapchat and Microsoft to provide data from social media networks to the debate moderators, and to enhance viewer engagement and online research. Facebook and Google will provide analytics to the moderators in advance of the debates on trending search topics, likes, re-posts, etc. In an email, Facebook said the new effort will help provide input from more diverse voices in the political process. Analyst Jack Myers at MediaVillage agreed and said the increased involvement of social media companies in the debates is long overdue. “It’s like taking the temperature of the population,” Myers said. “Social media will give the moderators a better sense of what’s capturing public opinion among different groups.” Especially, he said, among young people — who conduct a lot of their social lives online and whose opinions are notoriously difficult to survey through traditional polling. There is a less-elevating possibility, said Princeton University political historian Julian Zelizer: “It can create a much more chaotic and ugly debate, because what’s out there in the social media’s not always pretty. So some of the questions and some of the issues that come from the public might actually diminish the quality of the debate.” For instance, Google has just launched a new site that aggregates search-topic trends for each presidential candidate. Today it reported that among the top-ranked were “Jimmy Fallon” and “Trump hair.” That was a follow on media buzz from Donald Trump’s appearance on the Tonight Show the night before, during which host Jimmy Fallon asked Trump: “Can I mess your hair up?” Karlyn Bowman, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, said that what generates the most social-media traffic is typically whatever the mainstream media has hyped most heavily over the past 24 hours. Recently, that might have been birtherism, Benghazi, tacos or emails. But, she said, “the economy, terrorism and health care are the top three issues when people are asked to volunteer the issues that are most important to them, that they want to hear the presidential candidates address.” Follow Mitchell Hartman at @entrepreneurguy.  Mitchell Hartman Mitchell Hartman is the senior reporter for Marketplace’s Entrepreneurship Desk and also covers employment.

Robocars The vision of many of us for robocars is a world of less private car ownership and more use of robotaxis — on demand ride service in a robocar. That’s what companies like Uber clearly are pushing for, and probably Google, but several of the big car companies including Mercedes, Ford and BMW among others have also said they want to get there — in the case of Ford, without first making private robocars for their traditional customers. In this world, what does it cost to operate these cars? How much might competitive services charge for rides? How much money will they make? What factors, including price, will they compete on, and how will that alter the landscape? Here are some basic models of cost. I compare a low-cost 1-2 person robotaxi, a higher-end 1-2 person robotaxi, a 4-person traditional sedan robotaxi and the costs of ownership for a private car, the Toyota Prius 2, as calculated by Edmunds. An important difference is that the taxis are forecast to drive 50,000 miles/year (as taxis do) and wear out fully in 5 years. The private car is forecast to drive 15,000 miles/year (higher than the average for new cars, which is 12,000) and to have many years and miles of life left in it. As such the taxis are fully depreciated in this 5 year timeline, and the private car only partly. Some numbers are speculative. I am predicting that the robotaxis will have an insurance cost well below today’s cars, which cost about 6 cents/mile for liability insurance. The taxis will actually be self-insured, meaning this is the expected cost of any incidents. In the early days, this will not be true — the taxis will be safer, but the incidents will cost more until things settle down. As such the insurance prices are for the future. This is a model of an early maturing market where the volume of robotaxis is fairly high (they are made in the low millions) and the safety record is well established. It’s a world where battery prices and reliability have improved. It’s a world where there is still a parking glut, before most surplus parking is converted to other purposes. Fuel is electric for the taxis, gasoline/hybrid for the Prius. The light vehicle is very efficient. Maintenance is also speculative. Today’s cars spend about 6 cents/mile, including 1 cent/mile for the tires. Electric cars are expected to have lower maintenance costs, but the totals here are higher because the car is going 250,000 miles not 75,000 miles like the Prius. With this high level of maintenance and such smooth driving, I forecast low repair cost. Parking is cheaper for the taxis for several reasons. First, they can freely move around looking for the cheapest place to wait, which will often be free city parking, or the cheapest advertised parking on the auction “spot” market. They do not need to park right where the passenger is going, as the private car does. They will park valet style, and so the small cars will use less space and pay less too. Parking may actually be much cheaper than this, even free in many cases. Of course, many private car owners do not pay for parking overtly, so this varies a lot from city to city. (You can view the spreadsheet directly on Google docs and download it to your own tool to play around with the model. Adjust my assumptions and report your own price estimates.) The Prius has one of the lowest costs of ownership of any regular car (take out the parking and it’s only 38 cents/mile) but its price is massively undercut by the electric robotaxi, especially my estimates for the half-width electric city car. (I have not even included the tax credits that apply to electric cars today.) For the taxis I add 15% vacant miles to come up with the final cost. The price of the Prius is the retail cost (on which you must also pay tax) but a taxi fleet operator would pay a wholesale, or even manufacturer’s cost. Of course, they now have the costs of running a fleet of self-driving cars. That includes all the virtual stuff (software, maps and apps) with web sites and all the other staff of a big service company ranging from lawyers to marketing departments. This is hard to estimate because if the company gets big, this cost will not be based on miles, and even so, it will not add many cents per mile. The costs of the Prius for fuel, repair, maintenance and the rest are also all retail. The taxi operator wants a margin, and a big margin at first, though with competition this margin would settle to that of other service businesses. So what will the price be of your robocar ride? Today, an Uber ride tends to be a mix of a “per ride” fee (which hopefully covers the cost of getting to you) and about $1 to $1.50 per mile and about $13/hour in the USA. (In Peru it’s $3.60 per hour and just 40 cents/mile.) Depending on your speed, USA UberX will cost you $2 to $2.50 per mile. As such, $1/mile would be a very attractive, but also very profitable introductory price. Competition should drive prices down to more normal margins. Typical gross profits in transportation are 50%. This suggests from 20 to 25 cents/mile for the urban solo ride up to 50 cents/mile for the 4 passenger sedan (or just 12 cents/mile/person if you fill it up or carpool in it.) This means the small car at 25 cents/mile has revenues of only $35/day (around $12,500 per year) with COGS of $16/day. I have not factored in per-ride fees or trip minimums, which are normal in Taxi/Uber services. (The Uber $5 trip minimum covers a whopping 20 miles in this car.) I expect trip minima to drop to compete with $2.50 transit tickets, especially when pooling. Google runs a gross margin that’s very high (about 67%) but on the other end consider that Uber (though not profitable yet) takes 20% of its gross cost of a ride (and pays its own expenses from that.) Things still to learn The cost of maintenance is still a bit of a guess. As noted, for today’s cars it’s about 6 cents/mile, including 1 cent for tires. Electric drivetrains do require less, but how much less? Cheaper cars tend to have cheaper parts, it does cost more to maintain a $30,000 car than a $15,000 one. On the other hand, if you are running a fleet, you will pick parts with the lowest total cost (both purchase and maintenance,) designing them to wear out at just the right times, and accounting and measuring the variability of that. Cleaning is another unknown. If a passenger soils the interior in a way the internal camera sees, you can bill that to the passenger. You still will need exterior cleaning from time to time (especially on the luxury services) and at least a vacuum of the interior every so often. It will all be done very efficiently as cars pull up to the cleaning center. Robotic vacuuming is not out of the question since the cars will position themselves well and can move to help the vacuum robot. Exterior wash will be automated other than for tough things like bird droppings. What are these small cars? I describe a number of ways a 1-2 person robotaxi might be very cheap in this article. Let’s go into more detail on why it might get manufactured for around $10K (retail would be higher.) Note that there are already many low-end 4 person gasoline cars which retail around $14,000 such as the Nissan Versa and Chevy Spark. Outside the USA, there are even cheaper cars, like the $8,000 Renault Twizzy. Some of these cars are full-width and come with dashboards full of stuff, pedals, wheels, doors, hatchbacks and more. They meet crash-safety standards and the rest of the FMVSS. The basic commuter car will be: Just over half the width and under 2/3 the length of these cars Weigh perhaps half of those cars, using far less materials Have no dashboard, no radio, no pedals, no wheel Have only one door instead of 3 or 4, and no trunk (just an internal cargo area) Have only 1-2 seats (with associated airbags and components) Have vastly fewer parts In the urban version, not go over 45mph, allowing a low-cost motor What it will have is a battery pack. At 100 watt-hours/mile, a 10kwh battery would give it 100 miles of range, more than enough with recharging breaks during the day to cover the average of 140 miles/day it will do as an urban taxi. The forecast cost of $150/kwh puts that pack at $1,500. Expensive, but when combined with the much simpler electric motor power-train, a reasonable cost. It will also have about $1,000 of sensors and computers in it. These prices get this low because these vehicles are made in the many hundreds of thousands, and eventually millions. It also has a few things not found in cheap cars, like a single power door lock. The higher-end vehicle at $16,000 is pretty similar in design, but the extra money goes into making it more luxurious: Better seats and interior materials, replaced more often Better suspension for smoother ride Better sound padding A screen and sound system, or better ones than in the base vehicle A distinctive exterior with better styling and fancier paint, to let people see you are in the higher end vehicle. Power windows. (Both cars have power locks, and neither car need seat position adjustments.) Some fancier interior furniture (tables, drink holders, laptop holders etc.) Possibly a motorized door for easy entry (one of the more expensive add-ons) Possibly a sunroof (but there will also be open-top cars for order if you want them and the weather is good.) When I have examined the lists of luxury features on high-end cars, I have been surprised at how few of them are needed in the luxury robocar. Driver assist functions, 10-way motorized seats, motorized mirrors, telescoping steering wheels, fancy wheels, fancy lights and many other features pay no role in the robotaxi. My numbers are aggressive — so if you doubt them, increase them. The result is still a robotaxi at a very low per-mile operating and capital cost, which means in a competitive market, it will be available at a price that easily competes with private car ownership, and even subsidized bus rides. » brad's blog How does MPG compare to kwh/mile Submitted by Dave McEntee (not verified) on Mon, 2016-09-12 20:57. Hi Brad, Sashi sent me the link to this, and in general I love the topic. I realize for most it seems ironic that the former racecar driver promotes autonomous driving, but I am absolutely all for it, can't wait! My only commentary here is on the units for power. Your sheet shows power draw for the electric vehicles as kwh/mile, but then the Prius is listed as MPG, completely different. Is it possible to convert pump gas into kwh/mile? Honestly I haven't done the math to convert the units, I'm sure it's possible, but for me I think that conversion would be more fair. If the overall power use was accounted for (separate from the cost of oil atm) it might be more clear. With that, cost of oil (gasoline) could be the input to determine cost/mi for the ICE. Thanks so much for the post and the available table to "tune" the numbers. -Dave Mc. » reply Dollars Submitted by brad on Mon, 2016-09-12 23:27. I am not converting kwh/mile to mpg. I mean you can convert them, but that’s not relevant here, it is only the cost in dollars. As noted, the cost is from the Edmunds total cost charts, there are a couple of links in the article to them. In this case, the Prius is going 75,000 miles in 5 years which would be 1500 gallons and it looks like Edmunds has priced this a bit over $3/gallon, which is a touch high at today’s prices but not too far off. » reply personal robo taxi Submitted by Thomas Cocirta (not verified) on Tue, 2016-09-13 08:24.

I am a bit horrified that you needed to make this spreadsheet. And that it needed to be a such a slam dunk for some people to start thinking the right way. What you didn't include is the cost of human lives wasting away on the roads pointlessly paying attention to traffic. Or the ones quickly snuffed out because of the demand, clearly massive, to not pay attention to traffic. For example, your calculations don't factor in my last car which was totaled by someone who would much rather have been looking at his phone than driving. » reply Well Submitted by brad on Tue, 2016-09-13 15:34. I do have a big web site and blog with a few books worth of writing about those topics — they won’t show up in every article! » reply Calculations do factor cost of crashes as part of insurance... Submitted by Michael Haines (not verified) on Tue, 2016-09-13 19:40. But obviously not all the personal trauma and wasted time and loss of income in all cases. Also, if the fleet provider is the manufacturer, as their income then comes from journey's not the sale of products, robocars will be designed to last as long as possible, and made as simple to clean and maintain and refurbish; ideally with exchangeable pods that carry people by day and freight/parcels at night. This will make the cost even cheaper. Also, Brad didn't need to compare 'driver-time' as the comparison is with taxis or privately owned driverless cars. If you compare driverless with driven, of course the benefits are even greater! » reply The Prius Submitted by brad on Tue, 2016-09-13 21:05. Is a traditional personally driven car, I am just using Edmund’s total cost per mile number for comparison. Yes, I do believe that vendors might try to make the cars last more than 250,000 miles. But you can’t go too much longer, or your vehicle starts lasting too many years, and starts to go obsolete rather than wear out, like a computer. » reply Exactly. Submitted by cxed (not verified) on Wed, 2016-09-14 17:01. My only point was exactly that - if you compare driverless with driven, then the benefits are indeed difficult to doubt. It's just weird to me that the cost of our time is not taken more seriously (I'm not talking about Brad's analyses - he is a sensible guy always fighting the good fight!). For example, at a minimum wage of $10/hr and 65 mph (optimum), that's $.15/mile of my time and I pretentiously like to think my time is worth more than minimum wage. Sitting in traffic is something that will not result in 65mph (labor cost per mile approaches infinity as traffic comes to a complete stop) and is something that I dislike more than working in a minimum wage job. But hey, if Brad can show everyone, even those people who do not value their own time, that autonomous cars are economical on other merits, great! » reply Value of Time Submitted by brad on Wed, 2016-09-14 21:38. That is a 2nd order thing. First we want to know, how much is it likely to cost to ride in a robotaxi? Since driving your own car costs around 50 cents/mile, it’s a no-brainer if you can get the taxi cheaper than this, as it seems you can. If it costs more, then as you say, the rational thing would be to be willing to pay more than the 50 cents because of the time saved. People already do that with Uber. For example, driving to downtown San Francisco, where you will easily pay $30 or more for parking, quickly becomes a win with Uber because of the time you get back and the parking you save, even at $1.80/mile cost of UberX. There are many cities now where the math has people switching to Uber from driving their own car. » reply A few points... Submitted by Peter (not verified) on Fri, 2016-09-16 05:03. A few points I'm not sure You have given enought thought: A. Electric car vs. gas/hybrid: - the battery of an electric car is an expensive part which wears out and needs to be replaced, probably a couple of times during the car's life. Same is not true for the fuel tank of a gas powered car. Last time I checked, this cost almost outweighted the benefit from the electric power being a lot cheaper than gasoline (at least in my country). Renault's electric car cost model, with the car owned by the driver but batteries rented at a montly fee, allows for a somewhat realistic approach to this cost factor. - A gas powered car is capable of long range travel. You can hook up a camping trailer and go on vacation with one of them, or just on a weekend trip. You can't do the same with an electric car yet - the mileage of more than 200 miles on a single battery charge is already sufficient (you need to take a break from time to time anyway, why not use it to recharge the car battery?), but recharging times beyond 1 hour are not, and the network of recharging station is very far from the density of the gas fuel stations and very far from something that would make long-range travel with electric cars possible. With the ability of practical long range travel, a gas powered car provides more value than an otherwise comparable electric car. B. Robotic cars - robotic driving in the cities is still something for the future, not for tomorrow. Not a far future, mind You, but imho at least 5 years, more likely something like 10, maybe even 20 years. Robotic driving on the highways is probably something we will have very soon though. Computers are very good at handling situation where all variables are known and well defined. A closed environment like an automated high-rise storage facility applies to this description, a highway comes close enough so the advantages of robotic driving would with todays technology already outwight the disadvantages statistacally and increase the overall safety in this area. But the same is not true for cities - the range of unexpected situations the robot wouldn't know how to handle is just too big. Imagine a person walking on stilts long enough to step over a car (and doing so). Imagine a kid playing hide and seek in a quiet suburb area and hiding in a carton in the middle of the streat. And countless other unexpected situations a computer wouldn't know how to handle. - You compare robotic taxi cars with human steered driver owned cars. But chances are, when robotic driving becomes available at some point in the future for taxi cars, it will become a purchasable extra for new driver owned cars as well. This makes things like the parking costs advantage largely invalid - why paying for parking while at work when You can send Your car home instead and let it pick You up in the evening? Why paying for parking during a short shopping trip if You can let the robot driver circle the block for a couple times and let it pick You up afterwards? » reply Plenty of thought Submitted by brad on Fri, 2016-09-16 10:33. Electric cars and batteries are on a rapid curve of improvement, both in cost (going down) and efforts to improve lifetime. Tesla now claims with proper management they can get 1% degradation per year. But it goes further than that: Robotaxis will drive their battery “perfectly.” No sudden acceleration or hard braking to overheat it. Drive it from 70% of full to 20% of full and then recharge it every time. Humans don’t drive like this. Robotaxis will tolerate a degraded battery in ways a human driver won’t. A battery degraded to 70% is unacceptable to a human owner, but it is only a modest problem (dead weight) to a taxi which just doesn’t get sent on longer trips. Robotaxis aren’t used for camping etc. Electric cars aren’t used for long trips. If you want a long trip the taxi company sends you a gasoline taxi, or if need be, a rental car you drive. Of course, this article is about what will the robotaxi cost when it has become moderately mature. Of course they are not out yet. You may be coming into this without a lot of other context present on this web site. But if you thought to say, “Imagine…” in a few minutes, trust me, so have the teams after thinking about it for 10 years, and they have put that situation in their sims. Yes, some people will purchase cars. If they don’t live close to work, I do not believe it will be economical to send the car home, as parking somewhere roughly near the office will be much, much, much cheaper than sending it home or having it circle the block. » reply Thoughts Submitted by Peter (not verified) on Sat, 2016-09-17 03:06. - Electric cars and batteries improvment: I was not aware of this developmen. It was not the case when my last car reached it's end of life and I was considering an electric car as an option. - Robotaxis are not used for camping etc: Right, robotaxis aren't. But a driver owned commuter car that offers that option provides more value than a commuter car that can be used for commuting and shopping only. Means, an electric car is currently not only more expensive than an otherwise comparable gas powered car, it offers one important functionality less, and therefore much less value for money. - Parking: I think You are right about parking while at work. But when I see the prices for parking in my home city area, I'd estimate the cost for parking during shopping in the city about 16-19 times more expensive than letting my current car circle the block (if it already had a robotic auto-pilot and could perform this task). Circling the block would probably become even cheaper in case it would be possible to let the car deliberately join a traffic jam for the shopping time instead of avoiding traffic jams. » reply Value provided Submitted by brad on Sat, 2016-09-17 11:42. Key to the use of taxi fleets is usually fitting the right vehicle to the task. Single person car for one person riding a short distance (80% of trips.) Larger car, maybe with gasoline, for camping trip. Sports car with wheel for drive down a mountain road. Today’s parking might seem more expensive than circling. Circling costs $10 to $20 per hour, depending on the car today. No parking lot that charges by the hour is this expensive, though some flat-rate lots cost more. But that’s today. During the parking glut created by people switching to taxi mode, the bottom will drop out of the parking market. A parking space that is unused is wasted, best to fill it at almost any price. A robocar wanting to park will: Drive to the back/top of the lot where no humans park if requested Park valet style, using much less space; better than valet style — don’t need to be able to have a valet get in and out If a one person taxi, will put 4 to 5 in the space that one human parked car takes, due to small size and valet density. Leave, or pay more, if the price goes up. In particular, if a human driver willing to pay $8/hour shows up at the gate, the lot can let them in because the robots will leave and make room, so they never take your premium capacity If electric, make no emissions, leaving not soot on your surfaces (a real problem in lots) All payments and operations will be done via computers, no time taken by staff If you own a parking lot it literally costs you zero incremental cost to let the robocar wait there. No operating costs, no opportunity costs. And there will be hundreds of other lot operators also with zero incremental cost bidding to get what the robots will pay because it is all gravy, even if it’s just 20 cents/hour. It’s 20 cents/hour you don’t get if you say no. » reply Value for money? Submitted by Peter (not verified) on Sun, 2016-09-18 23:01. - multiple vehicles for multiple tasks: having a second car specialized on some of the tasks means additional costs - especially for purchasing it, but also taxes, insurance, possibly an annual toll, etc., most of which will not be offset by the costs saved by using the primary car less than if it would be the only car. Many of the secondary tasks the car is used for actually only make sense financially You attach to the mile driven not the total costs per mile, but only the costs for driving an _addistional_ mile with a car You allready pay the taxes etc. for because I need it for other tasks like the daily commute. If I already have a car for my daily commute, and want to go for a weekend trip, the per-mile-costs I have to pay _additionally_ to what I already pay for the car are slightly less than if I would go by train (this may be different in other countries). Buing an additional car for such trips only would be prohibitively expensive, using this secondary car for such trips would be, depending on the frequency and size of such trips, at least(!) 3 times more expensive than going by train. So what I came up when buying a car was a series of questions, starting with: Do I really need a car? (Answer: unfortunatelly yes) If yes, what is the minimum of car I really need? (Answer: a Smart fortwo, maybe even a Renault Twizy) What secondary tasks come up frequently enough so adding size and functionality to the car would pay off compared to renting or buying a dedicated vehicle for such tasks? (it resulted in a tiny 3,5 m long gas powered 4-seater with a trailer hook). - costs of parking vs. circling: as of now, a parking slot, even an expensive one, is usually still a block or more away from where I actually want to go. I not only have to take this walk, but also to pay premium parking fees for the time it takes me. This walking time would not be part of the equitation if an autopilot-equipped car could drop me off and pick me up at the front door of the place I want to visit. Means, circling time would be much less than parking time for the same task. But You are right, having the car going on auto-pilot to a cheap place a couple of blocks away after it dropped me off and park there for most of the time would likely be cheaper than letting it circle. I made the error of comparing parking now vs. circling in the future instead of future circling vs. future parking. » reply By the mile Submitted by brad on Mon, 2016-09-19 11:41. A car gets older in 3 ways. It ages by the mile driven (or more closely, by the hour driven, but most figures are done in miles.) It ages by the year (as things corrode or degrade) and it ages by the year in another way — it becomes obsolete. Some products, like phones do almost all their aging through obsolescence, and a little bit by use. Owned cars age through a mix of time and miles. They are designed for that, with a life of about 200,000 miles and 20 years. So leaving your car idle can be slightly wasteful. But taxis age much more by miles than by years. They are made from stock cars today (which are designed for 20 years) so they barely age by years at all right now. Since 5 years is not much time in the world of car innovation, they don’t age by obsolescence that much. In the future, the pace of change will speed up. It’s already happening to electric cars. Once your care does most of its aging by the mile, there is no more thinking that the cost of driving is just the cost of fuel and parking, the way people think about their cars today. That is going to be a big shift. Some services will price to try to match the old way of thinking, like selling you unlimited taxi rides for $500 per month or similar models. Or to match a car completely, $300 per month, plus $50 for a “tank” of 500 miles, plus an annual fee for insurance/maintenance. Just to make you feel good. As I said, hours are actually a better proxy than miles, but we’re not used to that at all. (In boats and planes it’s all measured in hours.) » reply Potential load factor benefits of robocars Submitted by Russell de Silva (not verified) on Sat, 2016-09-17 03:31. As robotaxis allow transport as a service to replace car ownership, the very large customer base of the bigger players should allow a degrre of ride sharing. This would obviously change the relative costs per person per mile of the 1-2 seat robocar vs the 4 seat version. I have not seen any modelling detailing the maximum possible load factors, but I presume Uber have a reasonable idea. Any thoughts? » reply Lots Submitted by brad on Sat, 2016-09-17 11:47. I have articles on the future of transit layout out official sharing with vans and cars. In the long run: Outside rush hour, the solo robotaxi is going to be so inexpensive that, except for long trips, all but the lowest income (or those seeking a social experience) will prefer to go solo for the privacy, comfort and no need to do any transfers at all, even minimal delay transfers. At rush hour, cities and highways will give rewards to people who pool rides — things like carpool lanes — which will encourage pooling in cars and vans and sometimes buses. For longer commutes, and longer road trips, cost will push people to pool. This will be a mix of solo car to the pool meeting point, and pool car/van along the long haul part. For example, for a 4 mile trip inside the city, at $1.50 in a private car and $1 shared, I’m going to go with the private car. For my 50 mile trip to San Francisco, at $16 solo and $8 shared with 2-3 minutes added trip time, I would be more attracted to the shared ride. » reply Comparing analysis Submitted by Tasha Keeney (not verified) on Wed, 2016-09-21 08:02. Brad, Great post. I have heard some researchers say cleaning is a cost that is under appreciated in these types of estimates, but agree that robots could be used and similar to the way Uber charges customers who soil the car, in car cameras would be a clever solution to handle that. My estimate is pretty close to your "cheap small" scenario. I have 31 cents per mile. I also included the cost of a teleoperator to remotely direct the car 10% of the time. I did some monte carlo analysis and took Google's published reports to estimate what we think the manual intervention rate at the time of commercialization will be. So, this third party labor component is actually my biggest cost bucket and my other costs are a little less than yours.

(Daniel Stockman/ CC BY 2.0) Share Written by Dave Gershgorn Obsession Machines with Brains September 17, 2016 Algorithms are unseen forces that dictate much of our life on the internet: Google search results,what we see on Facebook, and even spam filtering in email. And these algorithms are getting smarter thanks to improving artificial intelligence. To do so, they need to learn from more and more information. More often than not, the data these machines learn from comes from humans; Google’s algorithms, for example, learn to recognize speech by listening to tons of Google voice searches performed by humans. AI researchers need to be careful that these data accurately reflect the real word—because, like humans, algorithms can learn to be biased based on what information they get. Spare5, an AI training data service, recently learned this lesson in probably the most adorable way possible. Spare5 makes training data to teach AI about different things in the real world, like annotating thousands of pictures of food so your phone’s camera eventually can recognize pizza on its own. According to a blog post on TechCrunch, they decided to run an “adorable little brain break” for their workers: Rating pictures of puppies, on a scale of 1 to 5 stars. But when they got the data back, they were surprised by the results. Women gave higher cuteness ratings than men. On average, women rated each dog 0.16 stars more cute. Cuteness, charted. (Matt Bencke/ Spare5) “This was a simple example: binary gender differences explaining one subjective numeric measure of an image. Yet it was unexpected and significant,” the company’s CEO, Matt Bencke, wrote. So how would this affect an AI? Say a researcher was building an app where you could upload a photo of your dog, and the app would rate it and rank it among other pets out there. If the researcher’s training data only sampled men, the algorithm would be a harsher rater. Given enough data, other biases might emerge. If men preferred small dogs and women preferred large dogs, and the researchers used more data from men, then the algorithm would lean towards ranking smaller dogs cuter, because those dogs are better-known by the algorithm. When the stakes aren’t that high (it’s pretty tough to hurt a puppy’s feelings), this just seems like a fun example of the small preferential differences between different demographics. But it can also serve a reminder for those choosing data that their decisions carry the potential for greater consequences. In 2015, Google Photos categorized two black people as gorillas, as a result of a biased algorithm. The researchers behind the project later admitted that people with dark-skinned faces weren’t being categorized correctly. As a simple corrective rule, Bencke suggests that data scientists look for diversity in three places: themselves, their data, and those generating the data. We’re not in a place where every algorithm is perfect—and it doesn’t seem like we will be for a long time—but at least we get to learn something from puppies along the way.

While there are many good companies in the sector, it would be unwise to not have Google (GOOG)(GOOGL) in your portfolio if you are confident about the prospects of this sector. Google is the biggest company that is currently active in the VR space and I would recommend investors to buy the stock as it would likely dominate the sector in the future. Google’s upcoming Daydream VR platform The virtual reality market consists of massive opportunities to offer for many companies, and Google is well positioned to gain huge advantages from the VR market. The company is aggressively focusing on the virtual reality market and putting lot of efforts to grasp a robust position in the VR market. When the company decided to get staid regarding virtual reality two years ago, it took its first step by convincing its own employees. Initially, Google launched its Google Cardboard that was cheap and handy which turned a mobile phone grounded on its Android mobile OS into an improvised virtual reality headset. Image by 422737 / Pixabay As a matter of fact, the company received great response in return which forced the employees to believe that virtual reality was not just an experiment but a huge bet worth making. Furthermore, Google is on its way to launch its new Daydream VR platform as well as content hub, according to Bloomberg. The company detailed that Daydream will offer virtual reality based games, applications, and videos for VR supported smartphones. The company is heavily investing in the VR market, as it believes that virtual reality could turn into a leading way people engross with VR just like the Android became the prevailing way people engross with smartphones. Most significantly, the prospect for the company is that its new Daydream VR platform could turn into the place to access virtual reality content on smartphones. At present stage, there is no such type of virtual reality content hub. Google, instead of getting involved in a battle of having content creators or hardware manufacturers, is using a very smart approach to bring them all together at a single platform. As a matter of fact, TrendForce believes the virtual reality market will grow over $70 billion in sales by 2020, driven mostly by software. And, this is the primary reason why Google anticipates making the major impact. Given the huge potential, I am very confident about Google’s prospects in the space and would recommend to investors to add it to their portfolios.

It seems like nary a week goes by these days where I’m not meeting an aspiring UX designer for coffee and chats. What’s the best way to get experience? What should I put in my portfolio? How can I get my foot in the door somewhere with no experience? Why did I get that degree again? (Of course, as a dutiful and enthusiastic editor of UX Booth, I’d be remiss if I didn’t recommend that aspiring UX designers should peruse our Complete Beginner’s Guides. They’re pretty swell.) The fact is, the majority of traditional schools are simply not adequately preparing aspiring UX designers for the Real World™, and nowhere is this more obvious than with hiring managers. It’s a big discussion, which is why it’s the feature of this week’s True North podcast (which I personally just discovered). For those of you not familiar, True North is spearheaded by the usability-test-tool-suite company Loop11, and discusses—you guessed it—user experience design. And in the spirit of disclosure, they’re not sponsoring this post so let’s calmly put down the pitchforks… Check out the episode below (transcript and video, because we love our readers), and subscribe to True North…if for no other reason than to support the mysterious Breakmaster Cylinder, who apparently writes the jingles to EVERY SINGLE FREAKING PODCAST I LISTEN TO. Anyway. Yes. Good podcast, interesting topic. Let us know what you think. Design Horizons: Education The Transcript Question: So what was your degree and major studied at university? Answer: It was a Bachelor of Humanities, majoring in Politics, Economic History, History and Asian Studies. Answer: Just a Bachelor of Communications Design and Monash University. Answer: I did a Bachelor of Commerce majoring in Marketing and Entrepreneurship and then I went on to do some post graduate studies around Multimedia. Answer: I did a Master in Social Science, majoring in Human Geography. Ben Newton: UX Designers, you’re a diverse bunch. If we put 100 of you in one room I bet we’d have close to 100 different stories about how you got to where you are. And while many would view the meandering path that eventually leads to the job title of UX designer as an endearing trait. It does present a slight problem. How do you become a UX Designer? Here’s Andy Budd from ClearLeft in the UK. Andy Budd: I speak to so many people who have recently graduated from university who are frankly confused by the industry. Who are confused by arguments over job title and by senior designers going “well there’s no such thing as UX, it’s all just design really”. And yet, at the other end of the spectrum companies are advertising five jobs that all have different job titles that all look exactly the same. Junior designers are really, really struggling. What’s happening is people are coming out of universities with little or no experience, practical experience, and very, very minimal portfolios. You’ve then got design companies, in-house and external, who are needing to hire people, bring them on board, and have them able to start solving problems straight away. Those companies are typically looking for people who have a portfolio of four, five or six projects under their belt and who have had two or three years of experience. So as you can see, that creates a gap. How do you go from leaving university with almost nothing in your portfolio and no years of commercial experience and pick up a job which is requiring 6 projects and three years of experience? Ben: So the problem of not having a well-defined education-through-to-employment pathway could only happen in a niche or shrinking industry right? Wrong. Business is booming, according to folks like author Jeff Gothelf. Jeff Gothelf: Look I think it’s a great time to be a designer, it’s a great time to be in design. I am seeing the influence of design grow and grow and climb the corporate ladder. So this is an opportunity to really make meaningful impact both on companies, on your teams, on the products you are building, as well as, the world. So I would encourage folks to double down on their efforts because everything that I’m seeing is pointing to the increased impact of design and designers in the workplace and in the world. Ben: Ok, so we’ve got a set of skills that can be broadly lumped under the umbrella term of design and we know the technology world is increasingly going mental for designers. So, how do we create more, but not only that, how do we do it so that they are ready for the rigors of the industry and able to excell? Ben: Hi and welcome to True North. My name is Ben Newton and I’m from Loop11. This is the podcast where we share stories of discovery and innovation. Most of us have been taught that if you go and get a degree at university, any degree, then you’ll be far better off than if you didn’t. Speaking from my own experience, I’m not convinced. I went to university for 4 years and received a Bachelor of Contempory Arts, the most common response I get to that is questions revolving around was I a dance major. The answer, no, and if you’ve seen me dance, you’d realize there is not a dance school on earth that would graduate me. I, like many others, picked up my professional skillsets after graduating, while in the work force. Here’s Andy Budd again. Andy: We don’t have an effective education system which is producing, or rather it’s not producing job ready designers. I’m not sure that’s what the education system should be doing, there’s a whole debate around with the role of education is to open and enlighten people’s horizons or is it to produce willing cogs in the industrial machine. I think there is room for both and I think there are some universities who are producing people who are ready to start work, and some people should be opening the eyes of graduates to all the possibilities. Jared Spool: I think that design curriculums as they exist today are very much built on an old academic model. Ben: That’s Jared Spool, founder of UIE.com and co-founder of the new UX Design school Center Centre. Jared: The original universities were created to teach religious law. People realized that if you really wanted to get the masses to adopt the particular religious doctrine, you had to educate them. So they created this whole education process to do that and that’s what the modern universities are created on. So the whole academic models is about creating more teachers and when you try to apply that to trade work it falls apart right away. There’s not enough project work, there’s not enough experience. The people who do the teaching are often no experienced broadly enough in the trade that they understand variety of scenarios. So they teach these idealistic versions of what goes on and there’s just not enough time put into it. You know, take a design school, the average design school is a semester based program. Which means you get ten to thirteen weeks, classes are usually somewhere between 18 and 24 hours. These days projects are very popular in classes. That’s good, but for the projects themselves, each student is expected to spend upwards of 30 hours on project work. Basically, they are taking three to six classes at a time, which means they have three to six projects that they are working on at a time. Often due on the same day. Where else in the real world do we have three to six important projects due on the same day? We wouldn’t take that on. That’s the way it usually works and you’re expected to equally split your time that way. So 30 hours isn’t really a lot of time. In industry we have a name for the 30 hour point in a project, we call it Thursday. And so, that’s not really what projects are like. If you’re an ‘A’ student your experience is basically you put in your 30 hours on a project, you get you’re ‘A’ from your teacher. You do that three to six times per semester. Maybe the project comes back with a little bit of feedback as to what you could’ve done better, but most of the time the project comes back with virtually no feedback as to what you could improve. So you go through your entire design career at school thinking that your work is the most amazing work ever. Then you go and get your first job and the first thing you’re told is, “That” wasn’t good work because we put in more than 30 hours here and second you’re told that you need to learn a lot of stuff that you thought you already knew because you were getting “A’s”. And third, you’re told your design is not implementable or usable and you’re going to have to re-do it multiple times before it ships because that’s the way it works. The students are just not prepared. The hiring managers tell us this creates a lot of stress and a lot of problems with the folks that they get because they are just not ready for a production environment when they come out of these programs. Ben: I think we now understand the problem and many of you listening may have experienced this either as a hirer, a new employee or student. The good news is, there are people who are doing something to change things. We’re going to look at two of these cases. The first of which is Jarred Spool’s Center Centre. To give you some background, it’s not a traditional university, so what is it? Jared: Center Centre is a bricks and mortar school in Chattanooga, Tennessee, that me and my co-founder Leslie Jensen-Inman created with the intention of producing industry ready UX designers. Ben: Ok so the next logical question was why they created their own school? Why not partner with an existing institution? Jared: That’s a great question. I wish we could have partnered with an existing organization but as we started to look at what hiring managers needed we couldn’t find any organizations which actually met hiring manager needs. Leslie and I started four years ago with a research project where we just interviewed dozens of hiring managers at large, medium and small companies who were extremely frustrated with the quality of designers that were coming out of today’s schools. They knew a lot of book knowledge but they did not have up-to-date skills to actually be able to do the work and in many cases had to be re-trained. IBM has had this problem for a very long time. They’ve gone to the point where they’ve actually set-up a program where they actually take students right out of school and then re-train them for four to six months to actually get them to work successfully. Out of the four or six months of training only a few weeks are actually IBM specific stuff. Most of it is just general how to perform in a business environment and it’s because students in today’s programs are not really being well equipped to actually work. So we have these weird situations where there are all of these UX Jobs that are open but companies don’t feel that they can hire them because they don’t have the resources like IBM does. So it’s very hard for designers, right out of school, to get design work because they’re not equipped for the jobs which are currently open. Ben: So one company who could afford to do what IBM is doing is Google, but they wanted to approached the problem from a different angle. Here’s Mike Buzzard, he’s a Design Manager at Google. Mike Buzzard: One of the areas I’ve focused on since I’ve been at Google has been talent and from all different perspectives. From the bottom up, being from a UX team and their needs, to horizontally and knowing the different hiring managers, leaders and UX teams across the company. And then I’ve been a part of the hiring committee for about four years which led a little further upstream to what Google was doing on campuses. I started to see very different approaches to industry needs, or the skills that people might build on as they move towards careers. I would work with different schools, talk to different leads to try and figure out the history of why their programs were the way they are. When I got to SCAD we noticed such a diversity in design programs and some that had been very targeted and aligned with industry needs in the past. I just saw this opportunity to create this UX design or digital product design curriculum based on a lot of the ingredients they already had. Ben: Ok, so it’s no surprise that Google could see the trend of graduate designers being under prepared for the workforce, but before we go on, we need to explain who or what SCAD is. SCAD stands for Savannah College of Art and Design and to give us some further insight, here’s Jason Fox. He’s the Graphic Design Chair at SCAD, who along with Mike Buzzard, was a part of the User Experience Design course founding team and steering committee. Jason Fox: SCAD’s been around since 1978. SCAD’s mission is to prepare talented students for professional careers. That is the single reason we make all decisions. If it’s not career preparation, if it’s not career readiness, then it’s not important. Ben: So SCAD’s focus on producing industry ready graduates, seems to align with the goals of Center Centre. Let’s dive a little deeper into the detail and find out how both these schools aim to achieve these goals. Here’s Jason from SCAD again. Jason Fox: As the UX discipline is collaborative, so too is the leadership within the development of the program. So the Dean of the School of Design, the Dean of the School of Communication Arts, the Dean of the School of Digital Media, which are all schools within SCAD, work together with myself and a core group of folks from Google’s team, and develop the curriculum in three specific pillars. We wanted to make sure we touched on Human Behavior, lifting that up and providing a deep dive into that. We leveraged our Industrial Design programs, to include our Human Interaction classes, contextual resource classes. We adjusted our Foundation program to include Anthropology. The second pillar is our visual design which for the most part is owned by the Graphic Design department. So typography, idea visualization, some of our Adobe courses, all built in to start to lift up the idea of visual narrative, storytelling, within the visual design process. And then the third pillar is our technical proficiency or the closest thing we’d have to Lean UX engineering. So our programming courses. Finally, we cap that off with our senior year design courses which focuses on idea development and applying all of those outcomes from those three pillars, which we just covered, to UX problems. Ben: So SCAD was able to leverage off a lot of existing course content, piecing together what was relevant and then creating new classes where they were required. Center Centre on the other hand were a completely clean slate and thus needed to approach things differently, here’s Jarred Spool again. Jared: We need to rethink exactly how the school would in this situation and the only way to pull that off was to re-do it. So we got rid of semesters, we got rid of having multiple classes at the same time, we got rid of shorter projects. We ended up with a program where you take one class at a time, each class is three weeks long, and in a two-year program you’ll take 30 classes. They’re (the classes) for all aspects of UX design. So they include information architecture and visual design, user research and front end development, facilitated leadership and presenting. Communicating design work through deliverables and artifacts. Each class is comprised of three components. An industry expert, who is up to date on latest techniques, giving a two-day industry grade workshop to open the class and start the topic going. Then, three days of the students working on individualized projects for them to prove that they have mastered the materials themselves before they go into group work. And them two full weeks of group work where the students work 40 hours, each week, on a project that they are actually rejoining. So that project goes for three to five months. Instead of having little projects inside of a big class, we have big projects with little classes inside of it. Each project is with five to six students on a team plus one of our full time faculty members who acts the project lead or creative director, basically directing the project until a student capable of doing those tasks themselves emerges. The projects are real world, assigned projects, not greenfield projects. They go all the way through concept to delivery and deployment where the students actually get a chance to see the work that they do get deployed. Then they get to do research post deployment, like usability testing and other types of research to see if they actually implemented the design they expected to deliver. At the end of the two years the students will have five to eight of these projects they’ve worked on. Each one being able to show a full portfolio and talk in-depth about all the phases of the project and the work that they did. Plus, the experience of implementing everything from start to finish. Ben: What we can see in the different approaches of SCAD and Centre Center is a shared focus on the preparedness of their students. Another element that both institutions view as critical is the involvement from outside companies. Here’s Jason talking about SCAD’s partner program. Jason: When we work with partners, a couple of things are happening there. Not only are the students being exposed to partner ideas, strategies and processes, but the faculty are being exposed to that as well. What that allows the faculty to do is when they come back into the normal curriculum it’s impossible for them not to bring that experience back into their normal everyday classroom. So this loop is created especially when you add in the component of students who are also now finishing a collaborative project, let’s say with Hewlett Packard or Google or Coca Cola or whoever it might be. Then coming back into their regular curriculum and adding that value to their classroom experiences as well. What you get is this cycle which allows students to really begin to, if not jump to the edge of the technology curve, certainly get a whole lot closer to that. Ben: Both schools are at pains to point out that they ensure the expectations of participating companies are correctly set with student education and development being the focus and end results being important but secondary. Ben: With both courses being in their relative infancy there’s going to be a lot of observation and tweaking as they mature. I asked Jarred how they’re planning on measuring success at Center Centre. Jared: One of the things we’ve done is, the way we’ve created the curriculum is, we’ve identified all the competencies of what it means to be a designer today. And those competencies all came from our work with the hiring managers to figure out what they needed, so this is really preparing them for work. We have a basic schedule for how students should be acquiring those competencies and if students are not getting them on the schedule we expect, or the alternative which means they getting them way faster meaning we have to ramp up the skill level in the school, we can adjust for that in real time. Ben: So for now a lot of time will be spent by both faculties looking at what’s been put in place and how the students are progressing, but to a certain extent an amount of time will need to pass before results are clear. In the meanwhile other challenges will certainly keep both schools busy. Jason: The current challenge from a recruitment standpoint is informing eighteen year old students, and their parents, what user experience design is. Those in the industry, we know what it is, we know the components of it, even though it can be framed differently in many different capacities. And then finally, as with all challenges when working in collaborative environments, you’re having to work with folks from different backgrounds, in completely different majors. You know that was a challenge, and a good one.Â  One that I think is going to benefit future program development. Ben: And it’s not just the schools that are watching and learning, here’s Mike Buzzard again from Google talking about something they’ve learnt from the early partner projects being ran at SCAD. Mike: The one interesting finding was that we went into the first Collaborative Learning Center (CLC) project with the hope of equally splitting the syllabus from research to prototyping to refinement. We spent a good half on research, the students just really ate it up. Disconnecting their emotions and their identity from the creative work and then the insights they got from doing that was just so surprising to all of them. And very welcome. So I think that was something we thought was definitely needed but we didn’t realize it was going to be that impactful for all of the students who participated Ben: As SCAD and Centre Center’s courses progress the challenge will be thrown down to other universities to expand their horizons and catch up to the future. If they don’t they run the risk of their graduates being left behind playing catch up in a world that is already extremely difficult to keep pace with.

Reuters/Beck Diefenbach The Google Nexus 7 2016 launch event, which is also being called the Google Pixel launch event, could be taking place on Oct. 4. For quite some time, reports are suggesting that Google will be dropping its current “Nexus” branding and replacing it with “Pixel.” The search-giant will be launching the Google Nexus 2016 in two variants, Google Pixel and Google Pixel XL. The Google Pixel will have a 5-inch display whereas the Google Pixel XL will sport a 5.5-inch display, write The Asian Age. Both the devices are expected to run on the Android 7.0 Nougat operating system and could be the first to extensively adopt the Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 chipset. The Google Nexus 7 2016 will be announced on Oct. 4 and will be available for purchase thereafter. The Google Pixel (Sailfish) and Pixel XL (Marlin) specs and features have leaked on the Internet many times and both the devices have already been certified by the FCC, reports University Herald. The Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones may sport a 4GB RAM though rumours suggest the internal storage for Pixel would be 32GB and for the Pixel XL, 128GB. This is not yet confirmed. The Google Nexus Pixel and Pixel XL may sport 2560 x 1440 pixels and 2560 x 1600 pixels resolution and could be decked with a 13MP rear camera with some amazing features and high-advanced functions. There are still no reports as regards the price of Google Nexus 7 2016. A 5,100 mAh battery, Quick Charge 3.0 support, Android 7.0 Nougat OS and USB Type-C portare some features that the devices are expected to boast about. Google has been silent about its upcoming Google Nexus 7 2016 smartphones. Some rumours also suggest that the company will start taking pre-orders in the US the same day the Pixel and Pixel XL are revealed. This means the devices will be available for pre-orders from Oct. 4, right after the release.

But Google Maps recently showed it takes online privacy so seriously, it even protects the identities of cows. It’s Google Maps’s policy to blur the faces of people captured by Street View cars as they map the Earth. As NPR reports, the service recently took that face-blurring practice a little further than usual. On a road along the bank of England's River Cam, a Google camera captured a group of grazing cows. Normally, Google only obscures human faces, but apparently the website’s automatic blurring technology decided the identity of one black-and-white cow needed protecting—and blurred its face. David Shariatmadari, an editor for The Guardian, noticed the mysterious bovine on Google Maps this week and posted a screenshot on Twitter, where it quickly went viral. When NPR asked Google why that particular cow’s identity needed protecting, Google replied, "We thought you were pulling the udder one when we herd the moos, but it's clear that our automatic face-blurring technology has been a little overzealous. Of course, we don't begrudge this cow milking its five minutes of fame."

Skip to content Game Review Menu Home Adult Game Kid Game Mobile Game News PC Game Sport Game How to fix the most common Pokémon Go issues Posted on September 17, 2016September 17, 2016 by reviewaboutgame How to fix common Pokémon Go problems: a guide to overcoming some of the game’s biggest issues and bugs with minimal effort – even after the latest update. Although Pokémon Go has become a worldwide phenomenon, it isn’t without its issues. Aside from the server problems which have plagued the game since launch, there are numerous other bugs and glitches that can really ruin your Go experience. We asked you for your biggest problems with the game on Reddit, and have scoured the internet to see what the world’s Pokémon Go players are having trouble with. And it turns out there’s a range of issues which are making the game somewhat more of a challenge than it needs to be for many of you, not least the latest Pokémon Go update. Luckily, most of these problems are easy to get around. That’s why we’ve gone and put together this guide to give Pokétrainers a helping hand when dealing with some of the game’s more irritating bugs. We’ll start with how to sort the most recent complaint. WTF, THE POKÉMON GO UPDATE RESET MY PROGRESS?!! You’re not alone, not by a long shot. The latest Pokémon Go update has borked the progress of a great many Pokétrainer, particularly those who use iOS, as the bug is apparently down to the new version of the game linking its authentication process to the Google account you’re logged in to on Safari. The team behind Pokémon Go acknowledged the issue on Twitter:  Fortunately, as Niantic notes, your progress remains intact. All you need to do to restore it is log out of your account in the app (some users report it takes a couple of tries to successfully completely this basic operation) and then head to Safari. Once in Apple’s clunky, shouldn’t-really-ever-be-used browser, navigate to your Google account and log out of that, too. Now log-in to Google again with the same email you used to sign up for Pokémon Go. Now, log-in to Pokémon Go again and the issue should be fixed. The issue is primarily affecting iOS devices, but Android users are also reporting having had some joy with this workaround. Related: Pokévision alternatives – Best Pokémon Go maps and trackers SERVER WOES Let’s deal with this one straight away. Pokémon Go’s server issues are almost as well known as the game itself at this point, with numerous drop-outs occurring since the game went live. Things got worse once the game launched in 26 new countries, which sent the server into meltdown once again. Unfortunately, because the problem is with the server itself, only developer Niantic can fix it. Which leaves us players at the mercy of the devs’ ability to deal with it quickly. A familiar sight for any Pokémon Go player But, if you’re experiencing problems and aren’t sure whether the issue is on your side or theirs, there are ways of checking whether the sever is running or not. You can visit the server status page here or head over to downdetector for a more in-depth analysis of the state of things server-side. THE GAME DOESN’T WORK ON MY PHONE The next major issue to get out of the way is a pretty important one. If you don’t have the right handset, Pokémon Go won’t even open on your device. iPhone users need an iPhone 5 or later, and should be running at least iOS 8 or above. You’re going to need one of these bad boys at the very least if you wanna catch ’em all If you’re using Android, make sure you have Android 4.4 KitKat or later and your phone’s display has a resolution of at least 1,280 x 720. Once you’ve actually got the game working, you can get on with catching and training Pokémon. That is, if you don’t encounter too many of the following issues. GPS SIGNAL NOT FOUND Every now and then the game decides it can’t figure out where in the world you are, and displays the message ‘GPS signal not found’. If you’re experiencing trouble of this sort, there should be a quick fix. Android users can swipe down from the top of their phone to bring up the notification shade. Swipe again to bring up the quick settings. If the ‘Location’ icon is greyed out, you’ll need to tap it to turn it on and allow your phone to find a GPS signal. Alternatively, go to ‘Location’ in your settings menu. If the toggle is set to ‘Off’, tap it to turn it on. iOS adherents should open Settings, tap ‘Privacy’ then ‘Location Services’ and tap the toggle switch to turn it green. Another way to make sure your phone can be located easily is to ensure you have Wi-Fi turned on, even when using a data connection to connect to the game’s servers. And, if all else fails, try the classic method of turning it off and back on. In this case, quitting the app and reopening should do the trick, but if the problems persist, try rebooting your phone. THE SPINNING BALL DOESN’T DISAPPEAR You’ll often notice a spinning Pokéball icon in the top-left of the screen. This means the game is communicating, or trying to communicate, with the game’s server, and the icon usually disappears after a while. Sometimes, however, the little ball persists, which usually means the game is having trouble reaching the server. Of course, this likely points to yet another dreaded server issue, which again means there’s not much you can do. You can see what’s happening with the server by using the links listed in the ‘Server Woes’ section of this article. We’ve noticed the problem occurring after we catch a Pokémon. After throwing a Pokéball, rather than telling us whether the little beast has been successfully captures, the game will freeze while the Pokéball icon continues to spin in vain. In this case, you can try switching your data connection on and off, or, if you’re near a Wi-Fi network, try switching from data to Wi-Fi. If that doesn’t work, we’ve been restarting the app, only to find that the Pokémon is there in our Pokédex. So, if you’re worried about restarting the app when this happens, you can be fairly certain your hard-won prize will await you once you reboot. THE GAME IS REALLY LAGGY If you find the game becomes slow, laggy, and generally unplayable, it may be time to update the app. iOS and Android users can simply go to their respective app stores, search for the game, and tap ‘Update’ if that option appears alongside the game’s logo. If ‘Update’ doesn’t appear, your game is up to date, and the lag might once again be down to server issues. In which case, you guessed it – there’s not really a whole lot you can do until Niantic sorts it out. POKÉCOINS AND PREMIUM ITEM ISSUES If you decide you want to spend your way to the top, you’re going to need some of Pokémon Go’s in-game currency: PokéCoins. Once you racked up enough cash, you can exchange it for what are known as premium items. But sometimes you may find either PokéCoins or premium items you’ve purchased missing from your account. In which case, try signing out of your account by tapping the Pokéball icon in the bottom centre of your screen, and tapping on the cog icon to open settings. Then, just scroll down and tap on ‘Sign Out’. Once you sign back in you should see your cash or items reappear, but if not, try rebooting your device. Other times, you may find that you’ll receive a message saying ‘you already own this item’ when trying to purchase PokéCoins. In this case, Niantic recommends turning your phone off and on again. There seems to be a theme emerging here… MY TRAINER AVATAR IS STUCK Another common problem people seem to be encountering is their trainer avatar walking on the spot. The trainer should follow your movements around the environment, but if you find it gets stuck, try tapping the Pokéball icon in the bottom centre of your screen. If it doesn’t open, you’ll know the game has crashed and it’s time to restart. Otherwise, you might try switching between Wi-Fi and data, or turning GPS off and back on to prompt the game to reset its location tracking. We’ll be adding more fixes as we come across them, so stay tuned.

It also comes as Tesla, major carmakers and rival Google rev investments in autonomous vehicles.  Google parent Alphabet and San Francisco-based Uber have both been working on getting self-driving cars on roads.  Uber earlier this week deployed driverless cars for its ride-sharing services in Pittsburgh, pushing the envelope for the use of self-driving technology.  At the same time, Uber announced two other moves to further solidify itself as a trailblazer in driverless cars.  It established a US$300mil (RM1.23bil) venture with Chinese-owned, Sweden-based Volvo Cars to develop self-driving cars for sale by 2021.  And Uber is buying Otto, a San Francisco startup developing self-driving commercial trucks.  Uber and Volvo were two of the founding members of a coalition unveiled in April to push for a unified US legal code on self-driving cars – a group that also includes Google, carmaker Ford and Uber rival Lyft.  Autonomous cars are among big-vision ideas pursued by Google’s X Lab.  Google has driven its autonomous cars some 1.5 million miles (2.4 million kilometres) with only some minor dustups.  Early this year, the company announced plans for its self-driving car program to put down roots in the Detroit area with a technology centre.  The facility will house engineers and others testing vehicles provided by Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, Alphabet said at the time.  The tech giant began testing its autonomous driving technology in 2009 using a Toyota Prius equipped with Google equipment.  It now has some 70 vehicles, including Lexus cars, adapted by Google in addition to its in-house designed cars unveiled in 2014. — AFP You May Be Interested Billionaire Ananda Krishnan exploring taking Astro private India bans Zakir Naik's NGO Maybank sells entire stake in Visa Inc for RM413mil Beware of Rove beetles Private-public partnerships in a connected world Rejuvenate yourself with American ginseng Others Also Read Petronas’ net profit soars on lower impairment losses, other factors Malindo Air offering one million tickets to celebrate winning award Catch Doctor-X on the all-new dimsum.my! advertisement Latest News Rideshare service Lyft gets a flashy new look Photo Kit: Taking better photos of your pets (and kids) Make perfect copies of old photos with PhotoScan US trade panel eyes Qualcomm patent complaint against Chinese firms Google commits to post-Brexit UK with major London investment Most Viewed in Tech Make perfect copies of old photos with PhotoScan Photo Kit: Taking better photos of your pets (and kids) Warning!

  SOFTPEDIA® DESKTOP Windows Games Drivers Mac Linux MOBILE Android APK Phones Tablets WEB Webscripts Web Browsers NEWS Softpedia > News > Web / Internet Life > Google News FLASH SALE: VDownloader      50% OFF! Google Creates New Algorithm for Handling TCP Traffic Congestion Control GO Code to be included in the Linux TCP networking stack Sep 17, 2016 01:21 GMT  ·  By Catalin Cimpanu  ·  Share:  A team of six Google engineers has submitted a commit to the Linux networking development group that implements a new computer algorithm for handling TCP traffic congestion control. The team says the new algorithm has already been tested and used on Google's internal backbone networks, google.com and YouTube. The new algorithm is named BBR and stands for Bottleneck Bandwidth and RTT, where RTT is Round-Trip Time, the time it takes to send a message and receive acknowledgment that it arrived. According to the team's explanation, the new algorithm will improve the efficiency with which Linux-based servers will handle network bottlenecks. Previous TCP congestion control systems were developed in the '80s Google engineers said that existing TCP congestion control algorithms were developed in the '80s, such as Reno or CUBIC, and all rely on packet loss to determine congested connections. In their view, these implementations are flawed because, by the time a congestion is detected, it would be already late to re-route some users. On the other hand, BBR is designed to prevent bottlenecks before they happen, a crucial factor in today's Internet which handles large amounts of real-time data transfers. “  BBR creates an explicit model of the network pipe by sequentially probing the bottleneck bandwidth and RTT. On the arrival of each ACK, BBR derives the current delivery rate of the last round trip, and feeds it through a windowed max-filter to estimate the bottleneck bandwidth.  ” Server upgrades will be simple Google's staff says that implementing BBR only implies changes on the server side, not on the network or the receiving side. Equipment can be gradually upgraded without updating both sides of a connection. This means no patches for browsers, smartphones, or switches, just the servers. The Google team that worked on the project includes the pioneer of TCP/IP networking stack Van Jacobson and Linux kernel and networking guru Eric Dumazet. More details about BBR will be published in the ACM Queue, Vol. 14 No. 5, September-October 2016, under an article titled "BBR: Congestion-Based Congestion Control." #Google#BBR#congestion control#TCP#Linux subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news AngularJS 2.0 Released and Other JavaScript News Google Doesn't Give Up on Social Networks, Launches YouTube Community Node.js 7.x and Other JavaScript News Google+ Gets a Full Material Design Makeover, New Features Some U.S. Android Phones Have Secret Backdoor That Sends Data to China - Update OnePlus 3T vs OnePlus 3: Is It Worth the Upgrade?

Google’s self-driving car project has lagged with the departure of leaders and rivals’ advances. Photo: Ralph Barrera, Associated Press Google car project loses leaders, advantage as rivals gain 1 / 2 Back to Gallery Chris Urmson, the mild-mannered robotics expert who ran Google’s self-driving car project, used to say that when his son reached driving age in 2019, the technology would be available so the teenager wouldn’t have to take a driving test. In August, less than a year after auto industry veteran John Krafcik took the helm of the project, Urmson left with much work remaining: Google has yet to launch an autonomous vehicle service for the public. Other top technologists have also departed and progress has been slow. Once considered a leader in the field, Google has lost its first-mover advantage to other companies pursuing more practical, less-ambitious self-driving car services, said former members of the project and other people familiar with the situation. They asked not to be identified because details of the effort are private. “They need a partner, a sales force, a strategy,” said Roger Lanctot, associate director of Strategy Analytics’ Global Automotive Practice. Google’s project started in 2009, long before carmakers and most other companies seriously considered the technology. But when Singapore unveiled the first autonomous taxi service in August, Google wasn’t involved. Instead, a small startup called nuTonomy provided the technology. Uber Technologies Inc., founded in 2009, will soon let users of its popular ride-sharing app hail autonomous Volvo SUVs in Pittsburgh. Google has driven more than 1.8 million miles in tests on public roads in a bid to perfect its software to handle difficult situations, such as driving in snow. Tesla Motors Inc. already offers partially autonomous features in more than 70,000 of its electric cars, and Otto, a startup run by former Google car project members, is developing a self-driving system for trucks on highways, an easier technological challenge than the one Google faces. Uber acquired Otto in July. “Google still has an imperfect system and no clear path to go to market,” said Ajay Juneja, chief executive officer of Speak With Me Inc., which offers voice recognition and related technology for cars, watches and other connected devices. “How exactly would they have shipped something by now?” This is part of a broader challenge Google parent Alphabet Inc. faces turning research projects into profitable businesses. The company is more cautious about rolling out new technology early, after its Glass Internet-connected eyewear flopped, according to one of the people. There’s also a higher bar now for projects as Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat has said she requires clearer paths to profitability before approving more funding or expansion. Possibly the biggest drag on the program is the sheer scope of Google’s ambitions. Its aim is to revolutionize transportation through full autonomy. The software must be trained thoroughly to handle all eventualities. Meanwhile, there are already methods to make self-driving cars good, rather than perfect. That has helped companies including Uber, Daimler AG’s Mercedes-Benz, Tesla and Volvo Car Group catch up with Google, Juneja said. Uber’s service, which is tied to the smartphones of drivers and passengers, can generate a lot more driving data, an essential ingredient to quickly train the artificial intelligence software needed to guide self-driving vehicles, Morgan Stanley analysts said in a recent research note. “Uber logs as many miles in 24 minutes as Google’s autonomous cars have logged in their existence,” they wrote. “While none of these miles are fully autonomous today, we just point out the scale of experience that can accelerate the development of the AI, mapping and learning for autonomous cars.” Tesla, with thousands of Internet-connected cars on the road, has a similar data advantage, one former member of the Google car project said. The two main ways for Google to commercialize the technology are by including Chauffeur, the name for its self-driving software, in cars made in high volume by existing auto manufacturers, or through a popular ride-sharing service that could slowly replace a human-driven fleet with automated vehicles, industry experts said. Google has neither of these yet. It struck a deal in May with Fiat Chrysler, but only to put its software in 100 minivans. Talks with other car companies, such as Ford Motor Co., have yet to produce high-volume deals. And many car companies are pursuing their own self-driving strategies. General Motors Co. bought self-driving software startup Cruise Automation in March and invested $500 million in ride-sharing service Lyft Inc., gaining two important ingredients for an autonomous vehicle service. A Google unit invested in Uber in 2013, sparking speculation Google’s self-driving software would automate Uber rides. But Uber is building its own autonomous technology now. Google is planning to expand a ride-sharing service built around its Waze navigation app; however that will only be in San Francisco later this year, while Uber and Lyft cover most major U.S. cities. Slow progress caused frustration among some members of the Google car project, and that’s been exacerbated by early momentum of rivals that entered the race later, according to former members of the team and a person familiar with the situation. The team knew what it would take to deliver a fully-autonomous system, known in the industry as L4, but some Google executives didn’t understand the complexity, according to one former member of the project. The person left to help run an active business with paying customers, something that’s missing from the car project. A Google spokesman declined to comment for this story. Several years ago, some on the team wanted to push ahead with a service that didn’t require full automation, but Google co-founder Larry Page insisted on complete human driver replacement, another person said. Sebastian Thrun, the first head of the Google car project, left in 2014 to focus on his online education startup Udacity Inc. and develop flying cars with Page. In early 2016, Anthony Levandowski, one of the original engineers on the project, co-founded Otto. He started the company with Don Burnette, who wrote software for Google’s self-driving car, Google robotics expert Claire Delaunay and Lior Ron, who worked on Google Maps and Android smartphones. Levandowski declined to comment on why he left Google’s project. When Urmson left in August, other project veterans Jiajun Zhu and Dave Ferguson also departed. One former member said the project is suffering from a “seven-year itch” as staff look for new challenges. Googlers like to see technology they work on influence as many people as possible, so it’s been difficult to see the steady drumbeat of rival autonomous vehicle announcements while Google’s project slogs through testing, this person said. Google hasn’t decided on a business model yet, Krafcik said in the July 7 interview. “Serious snow testing” is still to come, while it could be 20 to 25 years before most trips in cities will be provided by autonomous vehicles, he added. That’s a stark contrast to Urmson’s oft-quoted prediction about his son’s driving test. During a recent text message exchange, he declined to say whether he’s sticking with that forecast.

Microsoft leverages Minecraft in battle for education market Backchannel This fall, Microsoft plans to weaponize Minecraft in the war for classroom mind-share by selling an education edition. It could prove an unexpected advantage in Microsoft’s increasingly fierce battle with rivals Google and, to a lesser degree, Apple over the education market. Microsoft’s Windows operating system still rules the global education market, but Google Chromebooks, which are cheaper laptops designed to run Chrome OS and primarily use online apps, have grown to dominate U.S. classrooms. In 2015, Chromebooks topped 50 percent of personal computer sales in the U.S. K-12 education market for the first time, with Windows PCs trailing at 22 percent, according to a Futuresource Consulting report. Microsoft has also been dueling with Google over education software, especially for managing and grading assignments. In April, it announced a Microsoft Classroom update to its Office 365 cloud service as a direct challenge to the Google Classroom and Google Apps for Education platforms. But a version of Minecraft tailored to K-12 classrooms could prove the truest arrow yet in Microsoft’s quiver as the tech giant aims to win over educators and students.

People play Pokemon Go at El Olivar park in San Isidro district of Lima, Peru, September 2, 2016. Credit: REUTERS/Mariana Bazo More like this New Android Trojan SpyNote leaks on underground forums This fake Pokemon Go game will secretly drive porn ad clicks Pokémon Go for iOS will stop requiring full Google account access Video Security Sessions: How to prepare for a data breach Security researchers have found a malicious application on Google Play that had over 500,000 downloads and was designed to gain complete control over Android devices. The application masqueraded as a guide for the popular Pokémon Go game and used multiple layers of obfuscation to bypass Google Play's malware detection mechanisms, researchers from Kaspersky Lab said in a blog post. The app contains a malicious module that doesn't execute immediately. Instead, the app waits for another application to be installed or uninstalled in order to determine if it's running on a real device or in an emulated environment, like the ones used to detect malware. How to respond to ransomware threats Once the app determines that it runs on a real device, it waits a further two hours before executing the malicious module, which then connects to a remote server and sends data about the device. The server can instruct the module to download exploits for local privilege escalation vulnerabilities that were discovered in Android between 2012 and 2015. These are known as root exploits because they grant access to the highest privileged account on Android -- the root account. In other words, successful exploitation will lead to a full compromise of the device. [ ALSO ON CSO: Pokemon Go: What security awareness programs should be doing now ] Google has released patches for all of these vulnerabilities, but because of the fragmentation of the Android ecosystem, there are likely many devices out there that haven't received all the updates. This doesn't mean that the 500,000 downloads represent the number of compromised devices. Android has local protection features like Verify Apps and SafetyNet that are specifically designed to detect and block known root exploits. Kaspersky identified over 6,000 successful infections, primarily in Russia, India and Indonesia. "However, since the app is oriented towards English-speaking users, people in such geographies, and more, are also likely to have been hit," the Kaspersky researchers said. The malicious “Guide for Pokémon Go” app was not the only app in the Google Play store that contained this Trojan module. Kaspersky found other such apps that were in the store at different times since December 2015. Most of the older apps had around 10,000 downloads, but one called "Digital Clock" had more than 100,000 downloads. Google has done a pretty good job at keeping malware out of its official app store over the past few years, but as this incident shows, malicious applications can still slip through from time to time.

By Stephanie Condon for Between the Lines | September 16, 2016 -- 21:08 GMT (14:08 PDT) | Topic: Google Google has acquired the two-year old startup Urban Engines to incorporate its location-based analytics into Google Maps. "Location analytics is an important focus for both Urban Engines and Google, and we're excited to combine forces to help organizations better understand how the world moves," said Urban Engines in a blog post. Google Maps has been improving and expanding its functionality, as Apple and other companies like Uber bolster their own mapping capabilities. Jen Fitzpatrick, who leads the Google Maps team, told Business Insider that they're trying to build "the richest, deepest, most detailed understanding of the real world that's ever existed". That includes incorporating the sort of rich traffic data that Urban Engines collects and analyzes. The company said it has customers across the Americas, Asia, Europe, Africa, and the Middle East. "With the rapid growth in sensors (GPS, beacons, etc.) on smartphones and cars and transit, we are now truly in the age of Internet of Moving Things," the company said in its blog post. "The potential to improve the lives of millions of commuters, by learning from commuting behavior patterns, reshaping congestion and creating new consumer services in each minute-mile is incredible."

I guess you might be able to call this case an amusing combination of both. In a screenshot grabbed by one Twitter user, it seems Google has (accidentally, probably) blurred out the face of a cow… Not long after this tweet started going viral, the puns started flowing in: “Some people think one cow looks much like any udder. Not so!” “Google teat view” “Anonymoos?” “Was she asked mooove out of the way or was the pic taken on the hoof?” As noted by another Twitter user, it’s not exactly uncommon for Google’s system to er on the side of caution and automatically blur faces that might not be faces. It’s also known to sometimes blur entire houses. So while I wouldn’t exactly put this in the category of being unlikely, it’s still amoosing.

I’ve done my best over the years to shed some light on how this sometimes mysterious score is derived by Google through several blog posts, conference presentations, and webinars. AdWords Quality Score Changes Sept. 12, 2016 With an impending change in Quality Score from Google due to roll out on September 12th, 2016, I wanted to share an updated version of my free AdWords Script that helps advertisers monitor changes in their account level QS. The change from Google is that keywords with insufficient data, either new keywords or keywords with sparse recent history will now get a null QS. I think this is a useful change because it gives us cleaner data to monitor what Google really thinks about our accounts’ QS. What Changes From the 2015 QS Update This change follows last year’s QS reporting update where Google started off all new keywords at a QS of 6. Prior to that, new keywords got an estimated QS based on historical data from others who’d advertised on the same keyword in the past, as well as the advertiser’s own QS history. In effect, the advertiser’s “account-level” QS was a factor in the starting QS of new keywords. After the 2015 Quality Score update, there were many more keywords at QS 6 than before, making it hard for advertisers to see exactly what their account-level QS was. The problem with the 2015 update was that it created two possible reasons why a keyword might have a QS of 6: The keyword earned a QS of 6 based on its history The keyword had too little data and was defaulted to QS 6 You can see why that can create some confusion: it’s very hard to determine if a keyword with a QS of 6 is worth optimizing or if it might improve on its own given a bit more time. In our research at Optmyzr we concluded that after approximately 100 impressions, an ad with a QS of 6 was probably really a QS 6 keyword and not merely waiting for more data. Optmyzr’s analysis showed that after ~100 impressions, the likelihood of changing QS from getting more impressions was much lower than during the first 100 impressions. This indicates that after 100 impressions, Google is confident in assigning a true QS to a keyword. For people who were monitoring account-level QS through scripts like the one I published or tools like the Quality Score Tracker from Optmyzr (my company), the 2015 change resulted in all accounts moving closer to an account-level QS of 6. In the example shown here, an account with great QS dropped a bit because a lot of keywords with sparse data got defaulted to QS 6. After the September 2015 QS change, most accounts moved closer to QS of 6. What is Not Changing Even though keywords with not enough data will now show a QS of ‘–’, these keywords remain eligible to participate in the ad auctions so this means that they actually do have a QS. The 1-10 QS number you see in the account is merely an indication from Google about the average QS. They continue to use a real-time QS (a.k.a. Fast QS according to Mitch, a Googler on the AdWords Community) that is calculated for every single ad auction. This is the score that determines a number of important things: If the ad is eligible to appear for the query In what position the ad will appear (rank and top-of-page promotion) The actual CPC needed to beat the next competitor What extensions and other features like dynamic keyword insertion (DKI) the ad is eligible to use Free AdWords Script to Calculate Account Quality Score If you’re interested to track how the Sept 2016 change impacts your account QS, be sure to start calculating it before the change with a script like this one. By calculating the score before and after the change using the same methodology, you can get a good understanding of how the change impacts you directionally. I first published a version of this script in 2013 and have now updated it in a few important ways: It only uses QS data when the QS is a number from 1 to 10. Keywords with no QS, i.e. ‘–’ are excluded from the calculation. Because Google now uses a blend of data from mobile and desktop, I modified the script to use impressions from all device types. A few years ago when mobile was not yet dominant, Google used a more limited data set to calculate QS so that all advertisers would be on an even playing field. The script still calculates the score using only data from Google Search. This is because different ad layouts on search partners could impact the score, so Google removes this variation by excluding data from search partners.

Of course there can always be unintended consequences so when people see fewer keywords with QS 6 they may think they are doing better or worse than before and change their accounts or bids. That’s why I like to monitor things closely, especially whenever there are changes being made by Google.

We've got your back. Read More . Quick Settings — the grid of “quick tiles” that you see when you swipe down the notification shade — is now fully dynamic and customizable. Many of the tiles are more functional than they were, you can reorder or remove them altogether, and you can even add new tiles from third-party developers. We’ll step you through everything you need to know about the new Quick Settings, and stayed tuned until the end to learn about some of the best new Quick Settings apps out there. Customize the Quick Settings Panel Swiping down once from the top of your phone’s screen shows your notifications as well as a quick access bar containing the first five tiles in your Quick Settings panel. Swiping down a second time opens the full panel. This is paginated, with nine tiles per page. You can also open this instantly by swiping down with two fingers. Ads by Google When you’re customizing the panel, the trick is to get your most-used tiles on the first page. Tap the Edit button in the bottom right to get started. Adding, removing, and reordering quick tiles is as simple as dragging and dropping them into place. Hold your finger down on the tile for a second, then drag it to wherever you want it. The first five tiles make up your quick access bar. You should put the tiles you use most — like Wi-Fi, battery, or flashlight — here. The first nine tiles in the list will appear in the first page. Tiles that are available but currently unused can be found in the bottom half of the screen, under the Drag to add tiles label. To add a tile, drag it up to the top half of the screen. To remove a tile, you drag it down into the bottom half of the screen. Quick Settings Shortcuts The functionality of the quick tiles has definitely been boosted in Nougat. Most of them now accept both a tap and a long-press. Tapping a tile enables you to manage the feature directly within the Quick Settings panel, like toggling the flashlight on and off, or connecting to a Wi-Fi network. Long pressing the same tile jumps into the corresponding page within Android’s Settings Access Hidden Android Settings with the Google Settings App Access Hidden Android Settings with the Google Settings App A lot of people don't even know they have the Google Settings app on their phone, but it gives you some great control over your device!

Most of them are shortcuts or single-function utilities — this isn’t the place to be storing fully fledged apps — but there are many that are very useful indeed. 1. Weather Quick Settings Tile Need to keep an eye on the weather forecast but don’t want a widget taking up space on your home screen? The Weather Quick Settings Tile is what you need. It’s a single, classy monochrome icon showing the weather conditions 7 Best Free Weather Apps for Android 7 Best Free Weather Apps for Android Read More and temperature in your current location. It updates every 30 minutes by default, or a single tap will get a new forecast manually. Double tapping the tile reveals a few handy configuration options. Download — Weather Quick Settings Tile (Free) on the Play Store 2. Tile Extension for Nougat Tile Extension puts a mini app launcher in your Quick Settings panel. The default options include a tile to launch the camera, one to launch the camera app in video mode, and one to turn data sync on and off. You can also set up three tiles for your own favorite apps.

If so, then you can use Searchly to replace the functionality in your Quick Settings panel. The app also promises more advanced searches, like getting directions home, although we couldn’t get these working in what is an early beta. The basic Google search is already worth having, though. Download — Searchly (Free) on the Play Store 4. Caffeinate Configuring your phone’s screen to turn off after 30 seconds is an important way of eking out a bit more battery. It’s really inconvenient, though, when you’re actually using your phone but just not touching the screen, like when you’re reading a long document, or following a recipe. Caffeinate solves the problem by keeping your screen awake for five minutes after you tap it. Download — Caffeinate (Free) on the Play Store 5. QuickTile QuickTile is like a Quick Settings version of the Tasker app. It enables you to group together several functions and activate them all with the single tap of a tile. For example, you could launch a video player, and increase the volume and screen brightness all at the same time. Or you could launch your Twitter client straight into the Compose Tweet screen. With some experimental root options in the works, this could become a very powerful app. Download — QuickTile (Free) on the Play Store 6. Ringer Modes If you only download one of these quick tile apps, Ringer Modes should be it. It could not be more simple or more effective. It switches your phone’s ringer between Normal, Silent, and Vibrate. Why this wasn’t a part of Nougat to begin with, we’ll never know. Download — Ringer Modes (Free) on the Play Store 7. Quidgets Quidgets allows you to put widgets into your Quick Settings panel.

It seems best suited to full screen widgets — for a quick check of the news headlines or your Twitter timeline it works like a charm. Download — Quidgets (Free) on the Play Store 8. Tiles The only fully paid app in this list is also the most polished and impressive. Tiles collects together many of the features of the individual apps we’ve looked at and more into a single tool. There are 16 feature categories in total, and you can activate or deactivate each one so they don’t clutter up your Quick Settings edit screen. With Tiles, you can launch individual apps or view an app launcher, make calls, compose emails, set a timer, or see the weather. You can also control many of your phone’s settings, like adjusting the brightness, controlling the volume, or locking the screen. There’s so much here to play with — this is already one of Nougat’s best apps. Download — Tiles ($1.49) on the Play Store Your Favorite Apps? As more devices start to get Nougat, we can expect to see a growing number of Quick Settings apps, and in some cases, we might even see support being integrated into existing apps. It’s a really powerful feature with a lot of potential. Have you found any good quick tile apps? And what features would you most like to see added to the Quick Settings panel?

Microsoft Fights Back Against Google Chrome Microsoft and Google are continuing their war of words (and videos) over which company produces the best web browser. Google Chrome is the market leader by a huge margin, but Microsoft claims Edge has the edge in terms of performance.

This time the company tested Edge, Chrome, Firefox, and Opera on Surface Books streaming Netflix videos. And, lo and behold, Microsoft claims Edge outperformed all of its rivals. Edge lasted 8 hours and 47 minutes, Opera lasted 7 hours and 8 minutes, Chrome lasted 6 hours and 3 minutes, and Firefox lasted 5 hours and 11 minutes.

The FBI Warns You to Cover Your Webcams You probably know someone who covers their webcam when they’re not using it. You may in the past have asked them why they do it. And when they told you it was to stop people spying on them you probably thought they were just being a little bit paranoid. But it turns out they may be the sensible ones after all. Why? Because even James Comey, the Director of the FBI (Federal Bureau of Intelligence), covers his webcams. And if the man in charge of the Feds is doing it, then you sure as hell should be doing it too. According to The Hill, Comey was recently asked, “Do you still have a piece of tape over your cameras at home?” To which he replied, “Heck yeah, heck yeah. You go into any government office and we all have the little camera things that sit on top of the screen,” he added. “They all have a little lid that closes down on them. You do that so that people who don’t have authority don’t look at you. I think that’s a good thing”. Comey isn’t the only person to have admitted covering their webcam either, with Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg outing himself Apple Ditches the Headphone Jack, Mark Zuckerberg Tapes Over Webcam...

Nonsense that really should get them unfriended, by you, immediately. Do your friends do these things? It might be time. Read More . But there is now a legitimate reason to stop doing this, beyond just the desire not to bore your friends and family with pictures of your odious offspring. An 18-year-old woman from Austria is currently suing her parents over the embarrassing photos of her they shared on Facebook. She claims it’s an invasion of her privacy, especially as they didn’t seek her permission before posting them. Which, to be fair, is rather tricky when you’re talking about a toddler. The woman, who has chosen to remain anonymous, told The Local, “They knew no shame and no limit. They didn’t care whether it was a picture of me sitting on the toilet or lying naked in my cot — every stage was photographed and then made public. I’m tired of not being taken seriously by my parents”. So, there’s something to think about the next time you’re poised to post endless pictures of your kids online without their prior knowledge. Lenovo Wants You to Skip the Sevens Faced with stiff competition in the smartphone department, Lenovo is coming out fighting. While Apple and Samsung make all the headlines, Lenovo reckons its handsets are actually better. But how to convince the general population that there’s life beyond the iPhone 7 and Galaxy S7? A campaign headlined “Skip the Sevens,” that’s how. There are full-page ads in newspapers, and a series of video ads showing just what the Moto Z has to offer over and above the “Sevens” currently on sale. Lenovo maintains the people in this focus group are real too. If you can believe it. The Moto Z does indeed have a lot to offer. The Moto Mods, which are basically snap-on covers which upgrade the handset in some way, are especially cool. And pretty unique in light of Google killing Project Ara Samsung Recalls the Galaxy Note 7, Google Kills Project Ara...

An HTC Vive Virtual Reality is Finally Here: HTC Vive Review (& Giveaway) Virtual Reality is Finally Here: HTC Vive Review (& Giveaway) The HTC Vive for Steam VR redefines gaming, and more besides.

The Smartphone Model Qualcomm is one of the biggest manufacturers of smartphone SoCs (System on Chips Jargon Buster: The Guide to Understanding Mobile Processors Jargon Buster: The Guide to Understanding Mobile Processors In this guide, we'll cut through the jargon to explain what you need to know about smartphone processors. Read More ) in the world. Ads by Google Based in San Diego, with offices in virtually every continent, the company employs over 33,000 people and pulls in over $25 billion in annual revenue. You might be familiar with its ubiquitous Snapdragon line of processors, which can be found on devices from manufacturers as diverse as HTC, Motorola, Samsung, Sharp, and Sony. One of the tactics Qualcomm has effectively used in its quest for mobile dominance is its Reference Design program. In short, these are fully-featured smartphones that contain Snapdragon silicon on the inside — the “gotcha” is that they’re not intended for consumers. Rather, third-party smartphone manufacturers (called OEMs, or Original Equipment Manufacturers) use them as the basis for their own devices. The fundamentals of the phone are there, but manufacturers can make small tweaks, such as change the display or upgrade the camera, in order to differentiate the handset from other smartphones based on the same reference. Reference Design devices are awesome because they allow manufacturers to save significant sums of money in research and development (R&D). This means that smartphone production is cheaper in the long run and thus results in lower prices for consumers. I should note that Qualcomm isn’t the only chip manufacturer with a reference design program. MediaTek, Intel, and BroadComm have all pursued something similar before. So, What’s This Got to Do With VR? It shouldn’t come as a surprise that Qualcomm is using the lessons it learned from the smartphone business and applying them to the promising world of virtual reality. The VR820 is its effort in this space. As the name suggests, it’s based on Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 820 chipset, which is found in a range of kick-ass smartphones, including but not limited to: the LG G5, the Samsung S7 and S7 Edge, the HP Elite X3, and the Xiaomi Mi5 Pro. Unlike the Vive and the Rift, the VR820 is a standalone device, meaning you don’t need to be tethered to a computer for it to work. All of the magic happens on the device itself. And as you’d expect, it ticks all the boxes you’d expect from a high-end VR device. It has integrated eye-tracking with two cameras, motion-to-photon latency under 18ms, dual front-facing cameras for six degrees of freedom and see-through applications, four microphones, and sensors for a gyroscope, an accelerometer, and a magnetometer. But this counts for nothing if the display is grainy and dull. Thankfully, it isn’t. In fact, it’s better than those found on the Vive and Rift, with a 1440 x 1440 resolution for each eye. (Indeed, the Vive and Rift both have 1080 x 1200 displays.) It’s worth pointing out that the refresh rate, which is vital when it comes to creating an immersive virtual reality experience, is nowhere near as good as that on the aforementioned devices: 70Hz compared with 90Hz. Like the aforementioned Reference Designs, this VR reference won’t be the final product seen by individual customers. Rather, it’ll be bought by other manufacturers and be used as the basis for their own upcoming VR devices — it will spawn an algal bloom of headsets, all different in their own ways yet still with the same origins. How Much Will It Cost? Let’s recap. Reference designs are essentially blueprints that allow third-party manufacturers to save costs on R&D. These savings get passed on to consumers further down the line. In 2013, Qualcomm said that over 40 OEMs had used its reference designs to build 170 different smartphones, mostly for the Chinese market, but also for consumers in India, Brazil, Taiwan, and Vietnam. So, what kind of impact with Qualcomm’s reference designs have on the price of VR headsets? This remains to be seen. The company has been tight-lipped about specifics, but speaking to The Verge, it said that it expects one of these headsets to cost the same as a “higher-performance tablet”. This is purposefully vague, but one can interpret this to mean between $300 and $500 given the current market. What This Means for Us The Qualcomm VR820 is exciting for two really huge reasons. Firstly, it’s going to cause a proliferation of all-in-one VR headsets that don’t suck. With the exception of the refresh rate, which I admit is a huge downside, it has the same specifications of other high-end headsets. In some cases, it utterly bests those from HTC and Oculus. Secondly, it’s going to make VR affordable. Small-time manufacturers are going to take Qualcomm’s reference design and will run with it. They will create models that are cheaper than those produced by the incumbents. But I don’t think that it’s going to be a downhill battle for Qualcomm. Not by a long shot. Smartphones are an easy sell. Almost everyone has one and many people replace them once a year, as they break or as more enticing models are released. But VR headsets are a niche device, and for many the value proposition isn’t immediately obvious. Qualcomm may struggle to stir the enthusiasm of its OEM partners. Are you thinking of getting a VR headset, or are you still very much a skeptic? If so, will you be waiting for one of the VR820 derivatives, or are you going to get an Oculus or Vive?

If all the processing is in the headset, it's just a more expensive Google cardboard. The Vive is for people who want to be immersed in real games, so until that headset can run Doom 2016 on it, it's old tech. Reply David September 18, 2016 at 2:41 am I am going to wait for the Oculus or Vive. The eyes are the windows to the world. Refresh rates above 60 fps is the way to go so that we do not get motion sickness. People that cannot afford $500 cell phones, don't purchase them. They will have sales and coupons for the Oculus or Vive or they will not be affordable. But they will sell. Reply Pedro Picado September 17, 2016 at 5:00 pm This makes perfect sense. And since I'm more in the "poor spectrum" of society, I'm all in for waiting till the prices drop. Reply Some Fool Online September 17, 2016 at 3:20 pm Going to get CMOAR when it comes out. Not even remotely interested in the Rift, Vive, or any other including this, given the price point and features offered by CMOAR's VR. Reply Jonathan vlietstra September 18, 2016 at 2:35 pm Then you just want to be able to look around at cool stuff in VR. While that's ok, it seems expensive for something that will get boring fast. Room scale is real VR, and you need a system that connects to a computer if you want to play games. So right now, the only real VR solution if you want to play a game in VR is the Vive. Reply Tp September 17, 2016 at 2:49 pm Good write-up .. however your are forgetting the one most important thing that will make or break VR. The very same thing that broke it back in the 90's. 3rd party software man .. this thing sounds great but without good software it's a paper weight. Will it support Google's new daydream? Apple products? I hope it does well I really do. I hope we get to a point where vr is accessible to everyone. Reply Stuza September 17, 2016 at 5:24 am Screen door effect is still significant on an S7 which is much higher PPI than PC based systems. Until the SDE is negated, im not buying a PC based one. These systems proposed by Qualcom won't have the GFX/CPU power to kick around PC equivalent games so won't be buying these either. Reply Mike September 17, 2016 at 3:49 am Very interesting, but your calculation of cost at the beginning is deeply flawed. The Rift and the Vive are aimed at gamers, and gamers already have gaming PC's. Adding the cost of the PC is wrong, like adding the cost of a car purchase to the calculation of going on a road trip. Reply Jaron September 17, 2016 at 2:25 pm Although, most of gamers aren't made out of money. I bought a gtx 760 right before specs were being released for the graphics card requirements. That broke the bank for me. Right now I would have to spend $1000 to use the vive and then I would have to find the room to use it. Everything is priced too high currently, that's why their sales numbers are so low. Reply bork September 21, 2016 at 2:09 pm They might be aimed at gamers now, but gamers have always been the group that are early adopters willing to dump big bucks into tech that the masses wouldn't even consider. Once the masses get a real taste of VR, look out. Reply Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

The music service behind the app really needs to have a healthy library of inspirational running music that suits your tastes. In this article, you’ll find recommendations for the best mobile music streaming apps, backed by an awesome collection of running music. What Is Running Music? Not everyone loves the same kind of music, and not everyone is inspired by the same songs. So what makes certain music better for running? It is, in essence, whatever makes your heart start pounding.

We’re here to find the kind of music that’ll inspire you to get off the couch and immerse yourself in the running experience. Not all mobile streaming music apps will give you that experience, but let’s take a look at all of your options. Ads by Google Pandora: Victim to Someone Else’s Whims The nice thing about Pandora is that it’s free. The Pandora app is available from either Google Play or the iTunes App Store. It takes no effort to start listening to music Improve Pandora With These Chrome & Firefox Browser Add-Ons Improve Pandora With These Chrome & Firefox Browser Add-Ons With over 35 million listeners, Pandora is easily one of the most popular Internet radio sites.

You just create a new station, type in a genre or artist, and it creates a streaming music station tuned exactly to the kind of music you’re looking for. The problem is, if you try searching for “running” music, you’ll find that those kind of stations are in short supply. Pandora search is primarily artist- and genre-based, rather than activity-based. Unless you know of specific artists or an overall genre that you love to run to, Pandora is going to struggle to fulfill your needs. Google Play Music: Dedicated Running Stations Google Play Music (also available from iTunes) is a music streaming app I discovered once by accident when searching around for some new music streaming apps to try out. I didn’t realize Google offered a dedicated free music streaming service until I stumbled upon it while checking to see how much it would cost to download individual songs. On Google Play Music The Best Music Player On Android: Google Play Music Reviewed The Best Music Player On Android: Google Play Music Reviewed One of the best things about Android is the diversity of apps, but sometimes the best apps are those produced by Google. Read More you’ll discover a “Working Out” genre all pre-programmed with energetic and motivational tunes to get you going at the gym or running on the trail. The “Working Out” section has a dedicated “Running” section. The “Running” section has a limited selection of stations filled with music. Based on the chosen song selections, the folks at Google seem to lean a bit more toward hip-hop, rap, and general pop music for running inspiration. Don’t get me wrong, the songs are great and the music will help you grind through your 5k run with little effort. You may just find that you’re running out of new music to listen to if you use Google Play Music often. Like Pandora, a drawback of Google Play Music, is that you’re streaming music over your cellular data plan. One bonus here is you can opt to go “premium” for $9.99 per month. Our advice is to download music Listen To Your Favorite Radio Stations Offline On Google Play Music Listen To Your Favorite Radio Stations Offline On Google Play Music In the latest update, the Google Play Music app for Android lets you listen to any streaming radio station offline. With offline caching you can download a radio station for listening anywhere. Read More , or entire stations, before you step out of the door. That will save a lot of bandwidth.

Read More that I truly experienced what an inspirational run can feel like. When you search Spotify for “running” you’ll discover all sorts of playlists covering a whole variety of music styles and interests. There are even running playlists organized into “type” of run like “Spring Run,” “Gym Beats,” “Winter Run,” and much more. The only thing better than having a nearly unlimited collection of running music at your disposal is the ability to listen to as much as you want offline. This is all thanks to Spotify Premium, which enables you t0 download as many tracks as you like for offline listening. This way you can go for a run deep into the woods without a cellular signal, and still listen to your rocking beats. It’s a beautiful thing. Slacker Radio: No Better Than Pandora The Slacker Radio app (from Google Play or iTunes) is another option if you’re looking for an quick app to stream music, especially if you’re at the gym where there’s an available Wi-Fi signal. You’ll discover quickly that the selection at Slacker Radio is just as limited as that at Pandora. It isn’t that Slacker is lacking in music that’s great for running, it’s just that the music isn’t organized into playlists or stations that make it easy to find and play. If you already have the Slacker app on your phone and you’re at the gym looking for quick musical inspiration, you can find it with Slacker. You will have to search for individual tracks to keep yourself motivated on the treadmill 10 Accessories Every Standing Desk Owner Should Have 10 Accessories Every Standing Desk Owner Should Have Whether you are planning to buy or build your own standing desk, or if you already have one, a standing desk isn't the only thing you need to improve your health in the office.

But if you run a lot and don’t really care about anything other than running, you might prefer the RockMyRun app. RockMyRun (available from Google Play and the iTunes App Store) is all about adding tunes to your run, and it does it better than probably any other app on the market. With a library of thousands of great songs, you’ll never run out of inspiration. You can choose which genre of music you’re interested in, or you can select the type of activity you’re doing, like burning time on an elliptical or running a marathon Train for a Half Marathon with These Running Websites & Tools Train for a Half Marathon with These Running Websites & Tools Read More . In the first case you can stick to the type of music you know you love. In the second case you can just let the app give you tunes that are perfect for that activity. It isn’t entirely just about music though. The app is intended to help you integrate music with your workout. It does that through a unique step-matching feature. This is where the app will let you choose music at a tempo that matches your running cadence. Or, you can adjust your cadence to match the beat of the music. In either case, it helps you maintain a steady pace. This is better for your breathing as well as your endurance. Run! Run Like the Wind! Now that you have a library of great streaming music apps to choose from for your run, why not get on some running gear and head out on the trail? There is nothing quite as energizing and motivating as a 20-minute jog listening to the music that you love. Why not give the apps listed above a try and let us know which one you liked using most while running.

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Andrea Peterson September 16 Follow @kansasalps An infographic explains how flagging works on YouTube. (YouTube) YouTube says more than 90 million people have helped it flag potentially problematic videos since 2006 — more people than the entire population of Egypt. That's just one statistic that the Google-owned video site revealed in a Thursday blog post about the importance of community moderation, as social media sites grapple with trying to balance free speech and potentially harmful content. Google's streaming video service has the same problem as many other social media sites: Users submit so much content that companies say it's impossible to screen it all for postings that are illegal or offensive, or violate a site’s rules in other ways. In YouTube's case, it says users upload 400 hours of video per minute — the equivalent of 100 copies of “Gone With the Wind.” [Puddles, bird feeders, rural intersections: How live streams of nothing became online obsessions] That fire hose of content is why YouTube, along with many other sites, ask users to help them by flagging videos that violate their rules. Many have answered that call. Users from 196 countries have flagged videos for YouTube, with one-third of those users reporting more than one video, YouTube head of public policy Juniper Downs wrote in the blog post. She also said “the number of flags per day is up over 25 percent year-on-year.” Reporting a video, however, doesn’t mean it gets taken down. First, it starts a more formal review process. Clicking on the flag button, which is accessible by selecting the “More” option below a YouTube video, will pull up a form that asks a viewer to tell YouTube why they are reporting the video. The form lets users choose reasons ranging from things like sexual content and child abuse to spam. A YouTube employee then reviews the video. [Why YouTubers are accusing the site of rampant ‘censorship’] “We have trained teams, fluent in multiple languages, who carefully evaluate your flags 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year in time-zones around the world,” Downs wrote. “They remove content that violates our terms, age-restrict content that may not be appropriate for all audiences, and are careful to leave content up if it hasn’t crossed the line.” YouTube declined to comment on how many people are part of those teams, exactly how many languages they speak or where the majority of the workers are based. Social media sites often walk a "delicate line" with moderation, said University of Washington law professor Ryan Calo. "The key thing to understand is that a platform like YouTube makes their decisions against the backdrop of our free speech principles and culture, but they are not bound by those principles," he said. A  site's own policies typically take precedence. Those policies, however, can be subject to interpretation. For instance, Facebook recently reinstated and apologized for removing posts of a Pulitzer Prize-winning photo from the Vietnam War that shows a naked girl screaming and running from a napalm attack. [Protecting your kids online takes a lot more than tracking their devices] The photo, called “Terror of War,” was initially removed when Facebook's review process deemed it child porn. The action prompted protests in Norway and elsewhere. “Sometimes, though, the global and historical importance of a photo like 'Terror of War' outweighs the importance of keeping nudity off Facebook,” Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg wrote in a letter to Norway’s prime minister. Online recruiting by groups like the Islamic State — including through YouTube videos — have also put security issues in the hands of social media moderators. In an interview with The Washington Post last year, Assistant Attorney General for National Security John Carlin said tech companies were being “exploited” by terror groups and that they needed to do more to fight back. Representatives from tech companies including Facebook, Google and Twitter attended a White House summit on how to block the spread of ISIS propaganda online. In the blog post Thursday, Downs said that YouTube is “vigilant and fast in removing terrorist content and hate speech,” but that those violations only represent 1 percent of the 92 million videos the site removed in 2015. She also encouraged users to “continue flagging.” business technology the-switch true Please provide a valid email address. Sign up You’re all set!

Register Now Advertise Gmail Finally Supports Responsive Design by Jess Nelson, September 16, 2016, 3:18 PM Recommend (7) Google’s Gmail email applications will begin supporting responsive email design by the end of the month, the technology giant announced on Wednesday.   Designed emails will now render correctly on any device that email subscribers access their Gmail on, meaning that mobile users will now have the same experience that desktop users do.   “Text, links, and even buttons will enlarge to make reading and tapping easier on a smaller screen,” writes Pierce Vollucci, product manager at Gmail, on the company’s blog. “If you’re on desktop, you’ll also see improvements, since emails designed for mobile can also adapt to fit larger screens.” Google’s announcement took stage front and center at The Email Design Conference (TEDC) in San Francisco, an email marketing and development conference hosted by email testing and analytics company Litmus. “This is the most ground-breaking development for email rendering ever in the industry,” says Kevin Mandeville, content designer at Litmus. Mandeville discussed the implications of the news on email design in a conversation with Email Marketing Daily. Mandeville emphasizes how much time developers have now saved, and how that time can be expended on more creative designs and projects. Before, he says that designers would have needed to send several hours per every single email that had multiple columns. When you stack testing and troubleshooting on top of that, it's self-evident that Gmail was becoming a big, time-consuming headache for email designers. “This allows us to focus more on the creative, creating a great experience for the end subscriber with out being bogged down in the design process,” says Mandeville. “It will make responsive design more accessible to more people building emails and give a better result for the end-user -- a nice, gorgeous, mobile-friendly design when they are in Gmail.  Justin Khoo, email developer at Email on Acid, also praised Google’s decision to incorporate responsive design in its family of email products, which includes the mobile application Inbox. He says it will be a “dramatic improvement” to email design. Google’s email update, expected by the end of the month, is a critical addition for email marketers looking to engage with mobile users. The ratio of mobile to desktop clicks over the past year has changed rapidly, with mobile growing by 15% since 2015 according to Yes Lifecycle Marketing’s latest email benchmark report. Revenue driven by mobile emails also jumped 32% year-over-year and 80% over the past two years, according to the study.       119 SHARES Tags: email, google Recommend (7) Print RSS All content published by MediaPost is determined by our editors 100% in the interest of our readers ... independent of advertising, sponsorships or other considerations.

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Steven Overly September 15 Follow @stevenoverly Lonnie Bunch, founding director for the National Museum of African American History and Culture, gives us an idea on what to expect when stepping inside the newest addition to the Smithsonian Institution. (Adriana Usero/The Washington Post) Lonnie G. Bunch III traveled to Google’s Mountain View, Calif., headquarters a little more than a year ago to meet with leaders of the Black Googler Network, an employee group. The director of the National Museum of African American History and Culture, which was then under construction, wanted to tap their technical expertise. “He made the simple request: ‘However you can, help me make this museum redefine what it means to be a museum in the modern age and be at the cusp of innovation,'” said Travis McPhail, a Google Maps software engineer. McPhail was inspired. Google employees have since been developing interactive-display technology that will allow visitors to examine artifacts from all angles using 3-D scans that they access through their smartphone’s Web browser. Their phone will also serve up relevant multimedia content, such as text or video, that better explains the artifacts and their significance to African American history. McPhail said that the technology aims to solve a persistent challenge for museums: only a fraction of their artifacts are on display at any one time. Historic objects must be specially handled and maintained, making it difficult for the museum to put out too many at once. There is also finite physical space. The technology eliminates those limitations. “I thought we should be able to add tech to this story and scale up the number of artifacts that would tell a historical story,” McPhail said. “We should be able to do that in a way where visitors really can get a sense of how these objects played a part in history.” The African America history museum is set to open Sept. 24, but the Google display is not expected until next spring. Representatives from the museum did not respond to a request for comment. This isn’t Google’s first museum project. The Google Cultural Institute works with museums and historic sites to integrate interactive technology into their exhibits and enhance the experience for visitors and reach those who may not be able to travel to a physical location. Earlier this week, the company unveiled an online exhibit called Natural History that uses virtual reality, online video and photos about dinosaurs and other prehistoric creatures to bring “an extinct world back to life.” Read more from The Washington Post’s Innovations section Read more Washington Post coverage of the National Museum of African American History and Culture African American museum is far from finished 10 days before opening The African American Museum tells powerful stories — but not as powerfully as it could The story behind the design of the African American history museum business on-innovations innovations Dallas shooting updates News and analysis on the deadliest day for police since 9/11. post_newsletter353 follow-dallas false after3th false Please provide a valid email address.

Guide Downloaders Get Malware by Josh Kirschner on September 16, 2016 in News, Phones and Mobile, Mobile Apps, Android Apps, Computer Safety & Support, Blog :: 1 comment Image courtesy Kaspersky Security firm Kaspersky reports that downloaders of a popular Pokémon Go! guide app from the Google Play app store may have been exposed to serious malware. The app, "Guide for Pokémon Go New" by Markersel (since removed from the Play store), was downloaded more than 500,000 times, according to statistics from Google. The app provided no useful advice to Pokémon fans. Instead, it was merely a ruse to install a malicious trojan that is capable of seizing root access to your Android device, disabling installed apps and displaying unwanted ads. And because the trojan was able to acquire root access, downloaders of the app face even greater threats. Roman Unuchek, Senior Malware Analyst, Kaspersky Lab says, “Victims of this Trojan may, at least at first, not even notice the increase in annoying and disruptive advertising, but the long term implications of infection could be far more sinister. If you’ve been hit, then someone else is inside your phone and has control over the OS and everything you do and store on it." Demonstrating the sophistication in the malware's development, the trojan also has unusual features to help it bypass detection. Kaspersky reports that malware doesn’t start as soon as the victim launches the app. Instead, it waits another two hours before starting its malicious activity, making it less suspicious to malware detection. More information about the specifics of the app infection process is available from Kaspersky's Secure List blog.  The Guide for Pokemon Go malware is a reminder that downloading apps from unknown publishers can be risky, even in the Google Play Store. Kaspersky says that at least nine other apps with this same trojan were available in the Google Play Store since December of 2015. It's best to stick with well-known apps and publishers, whenever possible. And make sure you have a solid antimalware app running on your device at all times. Many computer antimalware solutions provide mobile protection as part of the subscription (including our Top Pick, which happens to be Kaspersky), or go with a standalone mobile option, such as Lookout Security.

Installers for Google Fiber confer while working in 2013, in the Piper area of northwest Kansas City, Kansas. Keith Myers MCT i By Jonathan M. Alexander jalexander@newsobserver.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story GARNER Google Fiber has shown progress in implementing its super-fast internet service that can reach speeds fast enough to download an high-definition movie in 40 seconds. Just Tuesday it turned on its service for the residents and small businesses in Morrisville. But it raised the question of when other municipalities, including Garner, might reap the benefits of the high-speed internet and bundle television packages that Google Fiber offers. Garner was among six municipalities who will get Google Fiber in its town limits. Others included Raleigh, Durham, Cary, Chapel Hill and Morrisville. But Google officials have not been saying much, and efforts to reach them Tuesday and Wednesday were unsuccessful. Since its initial announcement 19 months ago that Google Fiber would make its way to the Triangle, Google officials have been tight lipped about details of the company’s plan. Town officials say they don’t know anything either. “No lines installed in Garner nor have they given any indication of start time,” Town Manager Rodney Dickerson said in an email. In order to turn on the service, a Fiber Hut must first be installed. Then Google service men will dig into the ground and install the fiber optic cables. Morrisville Mayor Mark Stohlman said those two steps took a little more than year to complete in Morrisville. Earlier this year, Garner town officials signed an agreement with Google to approve a site on Spring Road for its central command center, where the fiber hut will be located. However, it doesn’t appear that construction has started on the hut. One hut can provide service to as many as 20,000 homes. The Google fiber huts are 28 feet long and 9 feet tall, and are the backbone for the service. Still, there hasn’t been indication of a time frame or schedule of when the next service will begin. Google Fiber’s arrival in Morrisville could spur competition among other service providers. For years, Time Warner Cable has dominated the market. Google offers residential customers speeds of 1,000 megabits per second for $70 a month. AT&T offers the same speed at the same price. AT&T has already installed fiber throughout the town, but it has not yet been activated in households. It is, however, active at Greenfield Business Park, Dickerson said. Time Warner Cable offers speeds of up to 300 mbps for $64 a month. Morrisville residents and small businesses can now sign up online or by phone for a handful of Google Fiber services, including internet, television and phone. Jonathan M.

Call us conspiracy theorists. But admit it, the timing of Microsoft and Google's email upgrades sometimes feel a bit suspicious, as if both companies keep new email features at the ready in case their competitor makes an announcement. This week was no exception.  On Wednesday, Google announced an improved mobile experience for Gmail and Inbox. Microsoft followed up on Thursday with its announcement of Google Drive support for Outlook.com users.  Coincidence? We'll let you decide. Inbox and Gmail Get Responsive Google’s upgrades aim to make its Inbox experience better on mobile devices, particularly smartphones. In a blog post about the upgrades, Pierce Vollucci, product manager at Google discussed the issues that arise when reading email — most of which is still formatted for a computer — on mobile. Later this month, Gmail and Inbox by Gmail will support emails created with responsive design, marking an end to wonky rendering on different screens. Text, links and buttons will enlarge to make reading and tapping easier on a smaller screen. The improvements carry over to desktops, as emails designed for mobile will also adapt to fit larger screens. While an apparently minor release, the focus is to increase email accessibility and make it easier to work with. This small step forward adds to Google's cumulative effort over the last year to dramatically improve functionality in both inboxes. In August, for example, upgrades enabled the Inbox to interact with the Trello project management application and also with GitHub's software collaboration platform. Outlook.com Gets Google Drive Support The upgrades take both companies a step closer to the goal of making their respective inboxes the single place in which all work can be done.  Over the past couple of years, Microsoft has been working on the Outlook inbox to allow users to access, create, edit and store files in the cloud without needing to leave their email. Outlook already offered a tight integration with OneDrive — which comes with an Outlook account preconfigured — and mobile app support for Box, Dropbox and Google Drive. Up until this announcement, the Outlook web app didn't offer Google Drive support. On top of the Google Drive access for Outlook.com, Microsoft this week added stronger search capabilities for email attachments and the ability to share Facebook photos from Outlook.  This means users can open and edit Google Doc, Slide or Sheets from within Outlook.com. In theory, this will include the ability to save Google documents in OneDrive with an OneDrive integration, but until Microsoft releases the web app, it won’t be possible to test that.

The goal for participants is to come up with an exploit that allows remote code execution on multiple Android devices, knowing only the phone number and email address of the device. The motivation for the contest, according to the announcement post by Google Project Zero security researcher Natalie Silvanovich, is to learn more about how attacks against Android devices are discovered and carried out. "So why are we doing yet another hacking contest? Our main motivation is to gain information about how these bugs and exploits work," wrote Silvanovich on the Project Zero blog. "There are often rumors of remote Android exploits, but it's fairly rare to see one in action. We're hoping this contest will improve the public body of knowledge on these types of exploits. Hopefully this will teach us what components these issues can exist in, how security mitigations are bypassed and other information that could help protect against these types of bugs." In the contest announcement, Google Project Zero stated the contest would be different from other hacking contests, where participants would save up bugs and exploits to build an exploit chain, and then submit their finished work. Instead, competitors are expected to submit all their bugs in the Android issue tracker, after which they can be submitted by the participant at any time during the six-month contest. The catch, Silvanovich wrote, is that "[o]nly the first person to file a bug can use it as a part of their submission, so file early and file often. Of course, any bugs that don't end up being used in a submission will be considered for Android Security Rewards and any other rewards program at Google they might be eligible for after the contest has ended." In addition, Silvanovich said Project Zero will publicly share all of the vulnerabilities and exploits submitted for the competition. "Participants will submit a full description of how their exploit works with their submission, which will eventually be published on the Project Zero blog," she wrote. "Every vulnerability and exploit technique used in each winning submission will be made public." In addition to the top prize of $200,000 for the first winning entry, the second winning entry will garner $100,000 and at least $50,000 will be awarded by Android Security Rewards to additional winning entries. In other news The White House appointed Brigadier General (retired) Gregory Touhill as the first Federal CISO. Touhill is currently deputy assistant secretary of cybersecurity and communications in the Office of Cybersecurity and Communications at the Department of Homeland Security. "In his new role as Federal CISO, Greg will leverage his considerable experience in managing a range of complex and diverse technical solutions at scale with his strong knowledge of both civilian and military best practices, capabilities, and human capital training, development and retention strategies." The appointment was made as part of the Cybersecurity National Action Plan, introduced in February by President Obama, a plan "that takes a series of short-term and long-term actions to improve our cybersecurity posture within the federal government and across the country." The announcement of the appointment was posted by Tony Scott, the federal chief technology officer, and J. Michael Daniel, special assistant to the president and White House cybersecurity coordinator. Touhill's appointment comes on the heels of several high-profile government hacks, such as the OPM breach, and unflattering oversight reports on inadequate cybersecurity practices in agencies such as the FDIC. Two Israeli citizens, Itay Huri and Yarden Bidani, have been arrested by Israeli police and charged with running a massive DDoS operation, investigative reporter Brian Krebs reported. The two young men, both age 18, had been running the vDOS booter service, until this summer when the service was hacked, revealing that it netted at least $600,000 over the past two years -- and possibly much more, as vDOS began operations in September 2012. Krebs broke the story at approximately the same time the two were arrested in Israel in connection with an investigation by the FBI. Krebs reported that the two earned the money for helping their customers execute more than 150,000 DDoS attacks, and Krebs speculated that the vDOS operation may have been responsible for a majority of DDoS attacks over the past few years. As CIA director John Brennan warned that the U.S. should be wary of Russia's hacking capabilities and activities on CBS's Face the Nation Sunday. Politico reported Democratic Party state officials and parties were warned hackers were targeting them. The website obtained a copy of the email, titled "Security Alert: Please Do Not Search Wikileaks!" sent by the Association of State Democratic Chairs to its members. Recipients were warned against visiting the Wikileaks site because of concerns over the potential for being infected by malware transmitted through content on the website. Meanwhile, Brennan warned that "Russia has exceptionally capable and sophisticated cyber capabilities in terms of collection, as well as whatever else it might want to do in that cybersphere." Brennan continued: "Their intelligence services are quite active around the world, and this is something we have to make sure we're on guard for, not just for our national security purposes but also for making sure that our system of government here is going to be preserved."

A cow grazing on the banks of the River Cam in Cambridge, England, shows up in Google Street View with its face blurred for privacy. It's a harmless mistake, and one full of humor, especially given the amount of bovine puns that the Internet's technorati bestowed upon it this week. But the fact that Google's facial-recognition algorithms identified a cow—and probably many other non-human faces as well—is significant. It's at once a lingering effect of the privacy uproar that Street View faced in Europe a few years ago and a sign that Google's artificial intelligence has a lot of room for improvement. Great to see Google takes cow privacy seriously pic.twitter.com/ACTBpDwno6 — David Shariatmadari (@D_Shariatmadari) September 13, 2016 The search giant has gone to great lengths to promote its ability to detect faces. Consumers are perhaps most aware of the technology thanks to the recently revamped Google Photos, which automatically detects features in your photos grouped into People, Places, and Things. The People search can organize faces from across all your images, and can even detect the same person across several years. Using similar algorithms, the Things search can identify landmarks, even differentiating between famous landmarks and their identical copies. Did you visit the Statue of Liberty replica in Paris's River Seine? Google knows. Snap a picture of the mini Eiffel Tower at Las Vegas's Paris Hotel? Google will tell you. //Related Articles In Bid to Map Faroe Islands, Residents Strap Cameras to Sheep Like all machine-learning algorithms, though, Google's must be trained using as many examples as possible. The blurry cow on the River Cam is proof that even with an image database as massive as Street View's to learn from, the algorithms still aren't perfect. To help further their training, Google is making appeals to third-party developers, who can harness the detection technology in their own websites and apps via an API. As for the blurry cow itself, Google made light of the situation. "We thought you were pulling the udder one when we herd the moos, but it's clear that our automatic face-blurring technology has been a little overzealous," a spokesperson told the BBC. Of course, we don't begrudge this cow milking its five minutes of fame."

Let’s start with this. As we enter final weekend, athletes, Rio fans, armchair supporters, MBM readers, MBM writers, and real journalists the world over can start to assess what impression these Paralympics have left. For some, including the broadcaster Alex Brooker, above, it has meant an awful lot – and that is some speech: heartfelt, unscripted, and live on UK television last night. Others prefer to separate the narrative and context and simply prefer to revel in the spectacle of it all – the elation, disappointment, crowds, blood, sweat and tears that come with a world-class event. Whatever your inclinations, we can all agree it has been a ruddy good Games. Tonight, keep an eye out for Hannah Cockroft and GB team-mates Mel Nicholls and Kare Adenegan as they go for a gold-silver-bronze clean sweep in the T34 800m final in the Olympic Stadium. In the pool, we’ve got a host of swimming finals to get your juices flowing as well as wheelchair fencing, basketball and tennis, where GB’s Alfie Hewett and Gordon Reid face each other in the singles final. The pair won silver earlier this week together, in the men’s wheelchair doubles. But there’s plenty more, including football 7-a-side and goalball golds, to make sure you don’t spend your Friday glued to Chelsea v Liverpool.

Many companies in the automotive industry have their own models either currently on the road or being tested. The current state of self-driving varies among the different models and companies currently in development. There are companies such as Tesla who are currently on the road with their models, then there are companies such as Apple that only recently rented out space for research. In terms of self-driving car status, I usually think of it on three levels: the Apple level where they are still in the beginning stages of their vehicle, the Google level where they are still finalizing their models, and the Tesla step where we are already seeing them on the road. The current state of Apple’s self-driving car, known under the code name “Project Titan”, appears to be in relative danger. Despite being in the dust compared to Google’s and Tesla’s car, Apple is so early in the process that they are still recruiting engineers for their vehicle. All that can be assumed now is that Apple will follow their normal route and follow the modern look that Apple fans have been enjoying for years. Google’s self-driving car started developing in 2009. Though it is not as advanced in the process as Tesla, Google isn’t quite as disadvantaged as Apple is with their machine. Google’s car is currently still being tested on roads, all while boasting only one non-fatal accident. Not bad Google. Tesla motors. Tesla currently runs with a modern but not too noticeable aesthetic. Tesla Motors is widely known for their self-driving vehicles because of their progress in the industry. There are many Tesla vehicles on the road now being driven by customers. Unfortunately, the Tesla Model S found itself in hot water as of late. Last May, a fatal crash involving Tesla’s Model S vehicle was reported in Florida. From this, Tesla has been even more diligent in their software updates and manufacturing. The current state of self-driving cars is a pretty exciting one. Not quite fully mainstream, but also not just getting off the ground. There is definitely some evidence of the hard work and research done by engineers for years and it’s in the form of a purchasable, driveable car. Even though there is still much work to be done, I am more than excited for this step into the bright future of driver-less cars.   SHARE TWEET PIN SHARE Previous post Next post Other article this week The all-new College Democrats Club [The Stute]November 11, 2016 (Issue 10, Volume CXIV) SGA Constitution change proposal It’s all up to you Laugh at yourself a little Opinion Categories Campus News (453) Creative Space (8) Features (42) Full Issues (49) Online Issue (5) Opinion (681) Across the Hudson (21) Always Right (12) Campus Conservative (3) Cuisine Corner (66) Gaming Guru (4) Girl Talk (17) Letter to the Editor (41) Mind of a Freshman (62) Not With Those Shoes (28) Op-Ed (5) Ready Set Game (26) Scientific Curmudgeon (79) Senioritis (77) Stars of Stevens (17) Studying Abroad (10) Stute Editorial (81) Technically Speaking (73) The Jitsky Post (14) The Stute Reviews (8) The Stute Smackdown (14) WCPR ReWrite (12) Places To Be (4) Sports (2) Student Spotlight (5) Stupe (4) Uncategorized (31) Meta Log in Entries RSS Comments RSS WordPress.org Home Campus News Opinion Full Issues Subscribe About Contact Us Submit a LTE Submit a Tip ADVERTISE WITH US Archive Copyright 2016 | MH Newsdesk by MH Themes Share on Twitter Share on Facebook

But there is a clever way to dodge queues and Google is your secret weapon. Getty Images 3 I love queuing at Ikea. Said nobody, ever. The search engine has a really feature – known as Popular Times – which predicts when places will be rammed (or not). It’s based on anonymous data from people who opt to share their location when using their mobile. It lets you pinpoint when might be the best time to visit. For example, you can see that on Fridays at the London Eye the most popular time is between 2pm and 3pm, whereas arriving at 10am should slash your waiting time. Whereas visiting the Ikea in Manchester between 8 and 9pm on a Saturday is the best way to avoid the weekend crowds. The clever tip was picked up by MoneySavingExpert after their readers reported using it successfully. Google 3 Firstly, Google the name and location of where you want to go Google 3 Scroll down to reveal the Popular Times chart How to use the Popular Times feature on Google to avoid queues Firstly, do a Google search for the restaurant, attraction, etc. On the right hand side you will see a box with Google’s listing for the destination. If you scroll down you will see the Popular Times graph. You can then flick between the days to find the quietest times. Not all places have a times graph – it only appears once Google has enough data to establish opening times. Although, there are plenty of places where it does work across the UK.

Panoramics Photos Rec.humor.funny Joke Site Robocar Bog Twitter Best of Blog Brad's Home Robocars.com Home » Topic » Robocars Uber buys Otto, folks leave Google, Ford goes big, Tesla dumps MobilEye Submitted by brad on Thu, 2016-08-18 15:18. Robocars The past period has seen some very big robocar news. Real news, not the constant “X is partnering with Y” press releases that fill the airwaves some times. Uber has made a deal to purchase Otto, a self-driving truck company I wrote about earlier founded by several friends of mine from Google. The rumoured terms of the deal as astronomical — possibly 1% of Uber’s highly valued stock (which means almost $700M) and other performance rewards. I have no other information yet on the terms, but it’s safe to say Otto was just getting started with ambitious goals and would not have sold for less than an impressive amount. For a company only 6 months old, the rumoured terms surpass even the amazing valuation stories of Cruise and Zoox. While Otto has been working on self-driving technology for trucks, any such technology can also move into cars. Uber already has an active lab in Pittsburgh, but up to now has not been involved in long haul trucking. (It does do local deliveries in some places.) There are many startups out there calling themselves the “Uber for Trucks” and Otto has revealed it was also working on shipping management platform tools, so this will strike some fear into those startups. Because of my friendship with Otto’s team, I will do more commentary when more details become public. In other Uber news, Uber has announced it will sell randomly assigned Uber rides in their self-driving vehicles in Pittsburgh. If your ride request is picked at random (and because it’s in the right place) Uber will send one of their own cars to drive you on your ride, and will make the ride free, to boot. Of course, there will be an Uber safety driver in the vehicle monitoring it and ready to take over in any problem or complex situation. So the rides are a gimmick to some extent, but if they were not free, it would be a sign of another way to get customers to pay for the cost of testing and verifying self-driving cars. The free rides, however, will probably actually cause more people to take Uber rides hoping they will win the lottery and get not simply the free ride but the self-driving ride. GM announced a similar program for Lyft — but not until next year. Ford also goes all-in, but with a later date Ford has announced it wants to commit to making unmanned capable taxi vehicles, the same thing Uber, Google, Cruise/GM, Zoox and most non-car companies want to make. For many years I have outlined the difference between the usual car company approaches, which are evolutionary and involve taking cars and improving their computers and the approaches of the non-car companies which bypass all legacy thinking (mostly around ADAS) to go directly to the final target. I call that “taking a computer and putting wheels on it.” It’s a big and bold move for Ford to switch to the other camp, and a good sign for them. They have said they will have a fleet of such vehicles as soon as 2021. Other companies have announced plans to go for unmanned capable taxi vehicles, particularly Daimler and BMW, but they still maintain active “evolutionary” projects which hope to build on their prior ADAS work. Velodyne The other big news is that Ford, together with Baidu have made a $150M investment in Velodyne. Velodyne has been for a decade the primary supplier of LIDARs for robocar research projects, but their LIDARs are research instruments, high performance at high cost. In the meantime, other companies (such as Quanergy, for whom I am an advisor) have been pushing to make better priced LIDARs for real production. The Velodynes have been the right choice, because it is smart to research with what’s expensive today, knowing it will get cheap in the future. Baidu’s test cars have had Velodynes on them, but there were recent rumours of Baidu experimenting with alternatives to LIDAR, but this investment may counter those rumours. This investment will move Velodyne more to a lower cost production unit, though at present at a higher cost than the solid-state plans of Quanergy and some others. Google Departures Otto included a few people from Google’s car team. It was also recently revealed that Chris Urmson, who had run the team for most of its existence and was moved to “CTO” after the arrival of John Krafcik, has departed. I worked for Chris but he has not told me his reason for departure. In general, Google’s car team has gotten huge, and the recently departed people are mostly folks who were among the first 20 on the team. This may simply be a sign of massive expansion, I have not heard much to credit the idea that there is some sort of internal chaos. In addition, deals like the Otto deal will certainly cause people to consider if they want to work for a big corporation or break out on their own. MobilEye A few weeks ago, MobilEye issued a press release that they would not be supplying the next generation of their EyeQ chips to Tesla. The EyeQ4 is a great deal more sophisticated than the EyeQ3 that Telsa uses, and Tesla even uses an older version with a more limited set of features — including, most famously, the inability to detect things like cross traffic. Since MobilEye announced it, it seems like it was their decision (You don’t usually issue a press release to say you have been dumped by a smaller customer.) It caused their stock to take a quick big hit (Disclaimer, I own a small amount) on the day of the announcement, but it recovered reasonably well. Tesla’s stock was not affected. Tesla folks have always claimed that they only made minimal use of ME’s functionality, and that the real special sauce was theirs. ME folks have claimed the opposite. This break-up will settle that question, and presumably Tesla has been working on alternatives for a while as they don’t seem to be in much panic about it. Tesla has made announcements of plans for their new hardware and those plans look very similar to the EyeQ4, so they must have had their own parallel research underway. » brad's blog Question Submitted by Bill D (not verified) on Thu, 2016-08-18 16:41. Brad, Any thoughts about the MIT / DARPA announcement they might be able to design lidars on a chip to be priced at around $10 each Does that seem feasible to you? Significant? http://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-talk/semiconductors/optoelectronics/mit-li... » reply Solid state Submitted by brad on Fri, 2016-08-19 00:24. This project is attempting to do a solid state LIDAR, which is also the goal of Quanergy. Quanergy is much further along, and others hope to do the same thing. The $10 price point is when you are making many millions of the chip, and yes, anything that can go on one chip in those quantities can get a cost that low, though usually you add a few other things beyond the chip. Whether it is this, or Quanergy, or other companies working on it, low cost LIDAR is definitely coming, and will be used on all robocars, I predict, even Tesla (though Elon has sworn otherwise.) Or at least it will until there is some remarkable breakthrough in computer vision. Which is not impossible, but not here yet. I expect the cheap lidars are sooner. But if you have cheap lidar and cheap camera you use both, of course, at least for the first decade. » reply Current cost of lidar Submitted by Bo Nordlin (not verified) on Fri, 2016-08-19 03:13. Brad, I highly appreciate your writing. What are the current cost of lidars in an autonomous vehicle, and what has been the typical yearly price reduction so far? » reply Current cost Submitted by brad on Sun, 2016-08-21 18:09. There is no standard LIDAR. Velodyne makes several products ranging from $8,000 to $75,000. Valeo sells a simple 4 plane designed by Ibeo for $250 but it’s not really suitable for self-driving. Quanergy has a $1,000 8 laser unit being tested by some automakers. There are a few other research ones out there. Many companies have this in development, they only just figured it out a while ago. It is reasonable to expect that suitable LIDARs will be under $250, perhaps far under, but you may need more than one. » reply Quanergy et al chip based LiDAR RANGE Submitted by Rutt Bridges (not verified) on Sun, 2016-08-21 18:59. Brad, While I have seen multiple stories about chip-based LiDAR (mostly re: Quanergy), the one thing I haven't see is a spec on range. While the cost-effectiveness of these units could be a real breakthrough for driverless vehicles, if the range is under 100 feet their application will be quite limited. Have you seen or heard any quotes on range? » reply Range Submitted by brad on Mon, 2016-08-22 03:25. Range for LIDARs is more a function of their light frequency and eye safety rules. You can’t emit so much power that it would be dangerous to the eye. At that maximum power, you can go about 100m on a dark object and still be seen coming back (against the sun.) You can go further on brighter objects, and most objects are brighter, but you have to focus on that minimum range. » reply More sensitive lidar Submitted by Anonymous (not verified) on Fri, 2016-10-28 16:33. Brad, there's an Israeli company working on more sensitive lidar sensors with a better range. » reply That is true Submitted by brad on Fri, 2016-10-28 16:40. They are in my queue to write about » reply Don't forget the poaching of Apple's talent Submitted by Mario Herger (not verified) on Thu, 2016-08-18 19:41. Faraday Future also poached this week a high-profile Apple-engineer on self-driving and computervision: https://electrek.co/2016/08/15/apple-project-titan-loses-self-driving-an... Then the billboards all over highway 101 about the nano-degree in self-driving by Sebastian Thrun's Udacity It's astonishing the tempo that this has taken and accelerating... » reply ... but Apple also picked up an entire company's worth of PhDs Submitted by David Rostcheck (not verified) on Mon, 2016-08-22 08:52. Apple just bought Turi (nee Dato, nee GraphLab). In doing so they acquired the GraphLab Create and Turi Distributed platforms, nice toolkits that accelerate common Machine Learning tasks. However, those don't seem to fit with Apple's product portfolio at all. However they also acquired 50+ data scientists, most with PhDs. To me it looks like perhaps it's an acqui-hire, so they can use those resources on their internal ML projects (cough-self-driving-car-cough). Disclaimer: I'm an evangelist for Turi (i.e. a run a users' group for them, for which I get no cash compensation but do get the occasional perk like a conference ticket). However, I have no special knowledge about their business internals and this is speculation on my part. » reply Tesla & maps Submitted by Anonymous (not verified) on Sat, 2016-08-20 11:22. Hi, have you heard any news on tesla negotiating with a global mapmaker? I heard it here (webinar on high definition maps) http://ww2.frost.com/research/industry/automotive-transportation/automot... » reply Taxi model Submitted by Bejoy (not verified) on Mon, 2016-09-12 02:45. Hi Brad Given the pace at which taxi firms are trying to develop autonomous cars and autonomous car developers are increasingly foreseeing a car-on-demand model for the SDC operations, it remains to be seen how car owners/operators will prevent people from misusing the cars - Misusing meaning everything from pure vandalism and dirtying the car to outright car jacking/ using as a self-guided ballistic missile? Would you know if these firms have something in mind to prevent such incidents? » reply Rental cars Submitted by brad on Mon, 2016-09-12 11:12. Are these issues different from the issues with rental cars (Hertz) or carshare (Zipcar)? If they don’t have a wheel, you can’t use them as a missile (unless you physically alter the car, which again you can do with any rental car.) » reply You are right! Autonomous Submitted by Bejoy John (not verified) on Fri, 2016-09-16 02:45. You are right! Autonomous cars as missiles seem to be less of a threat. But when it comes to rental cars or car share, at the end of the day, the guy who takes it out has to face the owner of the car when handing it back. That leaves them kind of "obliged" to take care of the car in their custody, which is what prevents people from vandalizing the vehicle. Even a contract to take care of the car is useless if the car owner isn't around to track vandalism and take defaulters to task. Compare that to public toilets where no one is watching you use it and you don't have to face the owner(the govt., public utility cos). So people do not care so much and just use and leave it as they feel. Even facing another user doesn't seem to have the same effect as facing the owner. I see an analog in current business models of autonomous cars - nobody is watching you use it and the car just goes to the next guy who wants to use it. That made me wonder if such consumer behavior is already factored in (but maybe not announced) by autonomous car companies or is it that measures to counter such behavior need to be developed. » reply I have a number of articles on this topic Submitted by brad on Fri, 2016-09-16 10:36. Mostly related to the privacy problems because taxi owners will indeed want cameras to stop damage (mostly accidental) to cars as well as people leaving their stuff in them. My current model is as you leave (to stop the meter running) you flip the lever on the camera’s cover, it takes a photo after you are out, and compares it to the photo before you got in, and if there’s a difference, it is examined. In most cases it’s, “You left your bag in the car” but sometimes it’s “You spilled your drink or puked” and the car goes to the car wash and you get the bill. » reply Comment viewing options Flat list - collapsedFlat list - expandedThreaded list - collapsedThreaded list - expanded Date - newest firstDate - oldest first 10 comments per page30 comments per page50 comments per page70 comments per page90 comments per page150 comments per page200 comments per page250 comments per page300 comments per page Select your preferred way to display the comments and click "Save settings" to activate your changes.

As we have the last couple of months now, today we’ll be showing you another 5 Android apps that you should definitely give a shot… Navbar Apps One of the best things about on-screen navigation is the fact that you can customize it. It’s great to get updates to on-screen buttons through software updates, and some OEM skins let you adjust navigation as well. That said, it would be nice to have further customization available for the navigation bar. It does seem like Google is working on this for a future release, but for now, you can make your navigation bar your own with Navbar Apps. This free app allows you to easily adjust the look of your on-screen navigation buttons with colors, images, and more. The first big feature of Navbar Apps is the ability to change the color of the bar based on that app you’re within. It doesn’t work perfectly, but it’s a nice touch to your Android experience, although you can also set a constant static color if you’d like to. Along with that you can also add an image to the navigation bar, or show your battery percentage. Pretty soon, the developer will also be adding the ability to show music bars while music is playing. I’ll assume he means a visualizer. Tired of your boring Navigation Bar? Make it awesome! Turn it blue, make it red – anything you want. Select cool image as background or match color automatically to fit it to running app. Whatever you choose, it will be awesome! And then add some data, like battery level. All of that with Navbar Apps! Download Navbar Apps on Google Play for free Sleep Timer Just recently Google added a sleep timer to the official Google Play Music app for Android, and it reminded me just how much I love using the same feature through another app. Aptly-named Sleep Timer, this app allows users to quickly set a sleep timer for any music (or podcast) app they’re using. For me that’s Spotify, but it will also work with Pandora, Pocket Casts, and more. The app is pretty straightforward. Open it, set a timer, and hit start. From there any music you have playing will be paused automatically when the timer finishes. The app also features a customizable widget which can set and timer and open your favorite music app with just one tap. I’ve been using this app for a long time as a part of my daily routine, so I can wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone looking for a sleep timer. Sleep Timer lets you fall asleep to your favorite music. You simply start your music, and then set the countdown timer. At the end of the countdown, Sleep Timer softly fades your music out and stops it. Allowing you to get your precious sleep and stops your battery from draining. Download Sleep Timer on Google Play for free Conscient Our phones are getting really good at predicting what we want before we ask, and a lot of that is thanks to Google. One method Google uses to find out what users might want is the Awareness API. This takes data from various sensors on the phone and figures out what you might be doing. A great example of how this can be useful to developers and users alike is Conscient. This app allows users to create custom “fences” which take certain conditions such as walking, running, or driving and lets you assign a specific action to those conditions. For example, often when I’m driving I’ll need to pull up Google Maps, and because I’m driving I want to get that done as quickly as possible. With a custom fence I created in Conscient, I can get a notification when I’m driving that allows me to quickly launch Google Maps. I can also set it to open the app automatically if I would like. This app doesn’t work perfectly, but for basic tasks it’s great. Unlike other apps that do similar things, Conscient puts very minimal stress on your battery as well. Best of all, it’s free. Conscient uses Google’s Awareness API, which is an advanced set of tools to detect user activity with very minimal battery drain. Conscient leverages this powerful API and provides you a simple interface to let you automate basic functions in your phone. Download Conscient on Google Play for free Digit One thing that seems hard for everyone is saving money. Whether you have a lot or a little, it can be difficult to remember to put a few dollars aside. With Digit, you can do that automatically. So how does it work? The basic explanation is that Digit attaches to your bank account, monitors your spending habits, and finds little opportunities to save anything from a couple of cents to a dollar or two. That money goes into a secure savings account which you can pull from at any time. Now, whenever something free attaches to your bank account you might get worried, but with Digit there’s no need. To make money Digit takes any interest that is made off of what you save, but never takes away from what you have saved. I’ve been using the service for several months now without any issues and have saved well over $200 in that time, money that can be really useful in a pinch. The service, which has been around for a while, has just introduced a new Android app which lets you manage your savings and actions within the apps. Previously everything was handled over SMS, so this new app makes interacting with the service just a bit easier. You can even make up to $25 by referring friends to the service, if you catch my drift… Automate your savings. Digit is the free, effortless way to save money without thinking about it. Every few days, Digit checks your spending habits and saves a few dollars from your checking account if you can afford it. Download Digit on Google Play for free Muviz Music is one of the biggest uses for a smartphone, and with Muviz, you can bring your audio experience to life with a visualizer that rests on your navigation bar. For devices with on-screen navigation this means you’ll be able to see the visualizer behind your back, home, and recent buttons. If you don’t have on-screen navigation, Muviz will still work by docking the visualizer to the bottom of your display. In my brief testing of Muviz so far, I’m loving the experience. It works great, doesn’t seem to affect my battery too much, and it adds a bit of fun to your music listening experience. The app is free to download and includes several themes for free, but some of the extra options will require an in-app purchase. Bring your Music Experience to life with Floating Visualization beneath your on-screen Navigation Bar. MUVIZ is a first of its kind app that displays a Music Visualizer beneath your Navbar while you are listening to your favourite music from your favourite apps. NO root required. Download Muviz on Google Play for free Have suggestions for what apps we should feature next month? Drop a comment down below! We’d love to hear your recommendations.

Inspiration Project Muze: Cry for Joy? September 15th, 2016 by Dieter Petereit 0 FacebookTwitterGoogle PlusPinterestStumbleUponWhatsAppLinkedInXingE-Mail Project Muze, the new fashion experiment created in a cooperation between the companies Zalando and Google is well worth seeing. It might not do justice to the Zalando slogan “cry for joy”. But I cried nonetheless. Project Muze: Even the Muse is Astonished. (Foto: Pixabay.com) Can the Machine Inspire Your Clothing Style? Project Muze may be great when looking at it from an academic level. Here, Google tries to display an example of applied machine learning. The project is supposed to be some type of muse for your clothing inspirations. Sounds interesting, eh? This sure is a rather unconventional way to get to one’s own clothing design. All the algorithm asks of you is to answer a couple of questions that only deal with clothing in a peripheral way. The gender question seems feasible, although the answer won’t necessarily be evident when looking at the result. At this point in the process, I didn’t know that. In the further progress of the “design process”, I need to classify my mood, name my taste in music, as well as enter my favorite type of art. In the end, Google believes that it has gathered enough information to be able to give me a personalized clothing suggestion. This is the result: This is Supposed to be My New Look? Interesting. (Screenshot: Dr. Web) Cry of Surprise: I Can’t Accept This! Well, tell me what you think. Dieter wearing feminine pyjama pants, basically topless, and cluttered with black crystals? Seriously? Not even the most progressive stage director of any opera house in the world would make up something like that. And they do come up with some esoteric stuff often enough. I thought I might just be difficult to classify, so I looked through the gallery of already existing drafts of other muse interviewers. And, what should I say? It’s not looking any better over there. Judge for yourself: The Most Recent Trend Shows That Targes Are Back in Fashion. (Screenshot: Dr. Web) Two green targes are floating freely before and behind my upper body, while a swirling pattern is making my shirt and pants look like a colony of laevorotary bacteria, basically the Activia of overgarments. The attached targes remind me of the prime of the guillotine. Robespierre sends his greetings. Or take a look at this design: What Are You Supposed to Call This? A Generous Design? (Screenshot: Dr. Web) This looks like it could be taken from a gender-mainstreaming version of the Avengers. But nobody would put on something like this voluntarily. The bloomer-like bodysuit might prove to be quite comfortable on the couch after work. However, it doesn’t matter how long I think about this, I simply can’t wrap my head around what the strange cape, which is also able to float, is supposed to do. Do You Really Have to do Everything That’s Possible? Either I just don’t spend enough time in the world of modern fashion, which is certainly possible. Or this Google Experiment is just straight up garbage. Of course, Project Muze is based on Google’s TensorFlow, which is a library for machine learning, and is most likely very challenging technologically. Zalando‘s 600 fashion experts also contributed significantly towards the predictive decisions based on current trends. From a technological standpoint, we most likely can’t address reproaches to the agency Stinkdigital either, which also worked on the realization of the website. The result of all this effort is, simply put, unnecessary, and a good example that proves that you shouldn’t do everything just because you are able to do it. I’m sure you’ll understand that I won’t get any more “inspiration” regarding my clothing style from Project Muze. That should be in the interest of all of us.

Google has released this extension to the Mozilla Foundation under MPL 1.1/GPL 2.0/LGPL 2.1 in order that it might be used as part of Firefox if desired. We've landed this change on the trunk as a global extension as of 7 March 2006. You can read the discussion that lead up to to its integration in https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=329292 Google started migrating their Safe Browsing to version 4 of the protocol in 2015. We are currently working on integrating V4 in our code base with a incremental approach. That is, we will be landing V4 patches progressively and leave the V2 stack up and running until the V4 is extensively tested and the Shavar server has been upgraded to V4. In other words, V2 and V4 will co-exist for a while to ensure we don't break Safe Browsing. See the V4 implementation plan for the milestones and bugs involved.

自由電子報 | 影音娛樂 | 好康報報 | 自由部落 ‧Business Home Front Page Taiwan News Business Editorials Sports World News Features Bilingual Pages Home / Business Sat, Sep 17, 2016 - Page 11　News List Print Mail Facebook Twitter plurk funp Indonesia to probe Google AFP, JAKARTA Indonesia on Thursday said it would launch investigations into Google after the technology giant allegedly refused to cooperate with the country’s tax department, an official said. Google has denied the allegations, declaring it had paid all taxes in Indonesia since opening its Jakarta offices in 2011. The Indonesian government has repeatedly asserted the California-based company had outstanding tax issues to resolve. Muhammad Haniv, a senior official with Jakarta’s tax office, said Google had refused a request to allow tax officials to examine its financial statements. “We are now elevating this to an investigation, because they refused to be examined. This could be classified as a criminal offense,” Haniv told reporters, adding that Google generates tens of millions in advertising revenue, but contributed little in tax. ‘COMPLIANT’ Jason Tedjasukmana, the head of corporate communications for Google Indonesia, said in a statement that the company had always worked closely with the government and had “complied by paying all taxes which apply in Indonesia.” Jakarta has also applied pressure to other foreign tech behemoths, such as Facebook Inc and Yahoo Inc, over their tax arrangements in Indonesia. TECH BOOM Global tech businesses have flooded Indonesia in recent years to capitalize on the exploding number of Internet users in the Southeast Asian nation, which has an enormous population of young people with smartphones. One-third of Indonesia’s 255 million people have access to the Internet, but analysts say that number is likely to increase as connectivity improves across the archipelago.

Coming soon to the Triangle and starting to connect homes and businesses in Morrisville: https://t.co/M2rdOATtuJ pic.twitter.com/18bbt4nqgB — Google Fiber (@googlefiber) September 13, 2016 The Triangle is Google Fiber's eighth incursion. It's already available in Atlanta; Austin, Texas; Charlotte, North Carolina; Kansas City, Kansas and Missouri; Nashville, Tennessee; Provo, Utah; and Salt Lake City. The North Carolina activity may alleviate some of the doubts over Google Fiber's direction, which mushroomed several months ago, when the company acquired Webpass. Experimenting With Wireless Google executives last month filed an Experimental Radio Service License that would allow the company to offer wireless high-speed service in up to 24 U.S. cities, including a number of California cities and towns: Atwater, Mountain View, Palo Alto, San Bruno, San Francisco and San Jose. In addition, they are seeking permission to test wireless in Boulder, Colorado; Kansas City, Kansas and Missouri; Omaha, Nebraska; Raleigh, North Carolina; Provo, Utah; and Reston, Virginia. The few portions of the application that have not been redacted include detailed explanations of Google's plans to conduct radio experiments in support of Citizens Broadband Radio Service technologies, using experimental transmitters. The authorization would last up to 24 months, according to the filing. "The overarching concern regarding the granting of an experimental license is whether it will interfere with the operation of authorized devices and services," explained FCC spokesperson Mark Wigfield. "Therefore, an experimental license will be coordinated with those responsible for all potentially affected stakeholders," he told the E-Commerce Times, such as other bureaus within the FCC. "In this coordination process, an experimental license can be accepted as is, be modified to prevent interference, or be rejected," Wigfield noted. "If approved, an experimental licensee must accept any interference from other parties, and must immediately stop operations if a complaint of interference is made." Shifting Focus Google Fiber acquired Webpass in a bid to accelerate its buildout of ultra-high speed broadband access, after struggling for years to gain access to local markets dominated by rival broadband providers like AT&T, Comcast and others. Webpass provides high-speed service to thousands of customers in the San Francisco Bay area, Chicago, Boston, San Diego, Miami and some surrounding areas, with speeds up to 1000 Mbps. The announcement of the acquisition came after months of controversy surrounding Goodle's attempts to access telephone poles in the Bay area, beyond its existing service at Stanford University. The shift toward wireless broadband makes sense, given the inherent difficulty of breaking through incumbent dominance to gain access to the infrastructure required for competitive broadband service in metropolitan areas, observed broadband analyst Craig Settles. "Google's decision to put chips in the wireless game seems to have taken some folks in the industry by surprise -- but why? Those of us involved in municipal broadband since the Philadelphia wireless days know that wireless is cheaper and faster to deploy, especially in urban areas," he told the E-Commerce Times. Google has long said that ease of deployment -- essentially the ability to access telephone poles -- was a key driver in the deployment of Google Fiber, Settles noted. What the industry has been waiting for is the innovation necessary to allow gigabyte-level speeds for fixed wireless service. Despite the promise of wireless broadband, it's unlikely to make a major dent in solving the rural access problem, according to Christopher Mitchell, director of community broadband networks at the Institute for Local Self Reliance. "Google acquired Webpass, which uses both wireless and fiber, to connect buildings," he told the E-Commerce Times. "I don't know that this is a good solution for single-family homes."

 The exec Google hired to oversee Glass is now in charge of design for all hardware products Avery Hartmans Sep. 16, 2016, 12:09 PM 2,178 facebook linkedin twitter email print Ivy Ross, the head of Project Aura. Google+/Ivy Ross The head of Google Glass is now leading the company's efforts to design an expanding collection of hardware products whose appeal extends beyond the techie crowd. Ivy Ross, who previously served as head of Google's computer glasses  effort, is now overseeing the design and user experience for all hardware products, according  to her LinkedIn page . The new title reflects Google and parent company Alphabet's efforts to build new businesses that complement its internet services stronghold.  Google is ramping up its efforts to build its own hardware devices, with a new home-speaker device that will compete with Amazon's popular Echo, slated for release in the next few months.  In April, Google hired former Motorola executive Rick Osterloh to helm the hardware group, which includes the Nexus line of phones and tablets, the Chromecast TV dongle and other products. Ross, a fashion industry veteran, will focus on making sure the various gadgets are easy to use and have a look and feel that appeals to consumers. That's something that Google has struggled with in the past, particularly with the Glass device that Google launched a few years ago and for which Ross was hired to oversee. The futuristic-looking Glass product initially wowed the techie crowd, but was quickly criticized for being difficult to use and for its geeky appearance. Google stopped selling Glass to consumers in 2015 and renamed the Glass division Project Aura, as Business Insider reported at the time.  Google declined to comment on Ross's new role.   SEE ALSO: The head of Google Doodle says he sees 'Google' in everything NOW WATCH: How to see everything Google knows about you Loading video...

He hopes to run for a second term when the time comes. (Photo: Ayrika Whitney / The Leaf-Chronicle)Buy Photo 1 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE CLARKSVILLE — This month, Jim Durrett is wrapping up two eventful years as Montgomery County's mayor. With two more years to go in his first term, and a bid for a second term coming into sharper focus, Durrett feels the groundwork has been laid for long-term achievements in Fort Campbell's growth and stability, downtown Clarksville redevelopment, and futuristic industrial development accompanied by dramatic job creation. Buy Photo  (Photo: Tony Centonze/The Leaf-Chronicle) But with the growth comes growing pains, and Durrett acknowledges that the county he leads has plenty of them, from transportation gridlock to providing adequate services and amenities for both urban and rural areas of the county. All of this, while hoping to keep local tax rates at least status quo, if not lower — a priority for a large segment of his constituency. Durrett says he is enjoying being the county's mayor, a job that currently pays $151,740 a year. He emphasized that salary is set by state statute, not the County Commission, and has grown a little over 2 percent in two years. Durrett is already saying that he'll run for a second term, and indications are he's building the campaign war chest he might need to tell his administration's story. Recently, a private fundraiser event was held in Clarksville to "reflect" on his first two years. "I think it's pretty obvious now that I am looking at running for a second term. At this point I am pretty sure I will be throwing my name back in the hat for another run at the job in two years. The campaigning for it is now probably about a year, or year-and-a-half away from starting up," he said. 'Challenges into opportunities' Asked to rate his own success thus far, Durrett said the jury is still out to some extent, because there is so much more that he wants to do. "Over these past two years we've kind of been able to turn challenges into opportunities for Montgomery County," he said. Durrett is no stranger to the public realm. He's seen it from the inside for much of his life especially from the time he spent as chief of staff to former Clarksville Mayor Johnny Piper, but he admits a few surprises he's encountered over the past couple of years. Buy Photo  (Photo: THE LEAF-CHRONICLE/Ray Howze) "The biggest thing is the number of committees that I'm chairman of. It takes so much of your time, chairing and sitting on all of the many different committees," Durrett said, who noted that some of the 56 committees that existed when he started have been eliminated. Lots of committees mean lots of meetings, and that can be frustrating, he said, because it often leaves little time to hone in on some of the things he wants to do for the county. "All of that is important, don't get me wrong, but there is so much to do that I want to get done." He said he also prefers to deflect credit for any achievements to the broader administration and county commissioners. "When we talk about accomplishments in these first two years, first of all let me say that I don't think I, alone, have done anything. But together with our staff and the County Commission, we have done some things."

When the Department of Defense announced federal budget cuts creating what was potentially feared to be a 50 percent reduction in force at Fort Campbell, a series of public listening sessions was hosted by the DoD at different military installations including the local post. "We had to put together the presentation on Fort Campbell, and what it means to our community ... and quite frankly, I felt that Montgomery County took the lead in putting that listening session together, working with our partners in the city (of Clarksville), Hopkinsville and Christian County, and of course Fort Campbell and the surrounding area." In the end, Fort Campbell was spared dramatic cuts.

In December 2014 Clarksville-Montgomery County and Middle Tennessee got word that Hemlock Semiconductor was closing, before it even was to begin any production of polysilicon. Durrett said deep disappointment was replaced by a new era of excitement and possibilities for the community. "I'll never forget the day they called us into a meeting and told us they were going to mothball the plant," Durrett said "We landed Google in Hemlock's place, which meant fewer jobs — about 70, versus the 500 that Hemlock had promised in the first phase, but when you talk about a company with a global brand like Google, even the announcement itself puts us on the worldwide map. We believe this will also be a project that will attract more business interests, many of them related to Google being here," Durrett said.

Durrett's administration also sought, and gained, County Commission approval for a dual-faceted attempt to help stimulate downtown revitalization. The downtown area has suffered through a series of economic failings since, and even shortly before, the January 1999 tornado, and a priority of Durrett's has been to try some ways to help restore the downtown tax base. "What we've accomplished for downtown Clarksville also ranks pretty high in our first two years of accomplishments as a community, I think. I've always said that if something good happens in downtown, it's good for all of Montgomery County. The development of civic plaza, and the approval of tax increment financing for downtown redevelopment — between these two things I think we're going to be able to someday look back on that and say that it was a defining moment in bringing our downtown area and its tax base back," he said. The city council later voted to join the tax-increment financing plan. The civic plaza does is not recorded on city or county tax rolls. Disappointed with relationship with city Buy Photo  (Photo: THE LEAF-CHRONICLE/Ray Howze) Durrett says his greatest obstacle has been achieving a good working relationship with the city of Clarksville, chiefly Clarksville Mayor Kim McMillan and her administration. His goal in the next two years is building a stronger rapport. "My biggest disappointment in these first two years is not being able to work with the city like I would like to. Am I part of the problem? I'm sure that's probably the case. Is some of it the city's problem? I'm sure it is," Durrett said. "It's a problem that's out there, and everybody knows about it, so there is no use in denying it or pretending that it's a problem that doesn't exist. It's something that I think about and pray about every day. So I hope in the months ahead we can cross this bridge and have a greater spirit of unity and cooperation between the county and the city. We'll be able to get a lot more done for the betterment of our community if we can achieve this," he said. Lost time with family The hardest part of being county mayor, or perhaps any elected official, is the time commitment invested in it. Recently, District 4 Commissioner Mark Riggins resigned for that very reason, saying he needs more time with his family. Durrett said he keenly understands this.

You get phone calls almost around the clock," Durrett said. But the enjoyment and the challenge of making Montgomery County a better place, both in big and small ways, energizes him. Eyes on downtown With two years left in his first term, Durrett says there is much work left to finish, and new challenges and opportunities that he is eager to turn his attention to.

The site of the building will be the future site for the Civic Plaza park.  (Photo: Ayrika Whitney / The Leaf-Chronicle) "I think we've got to finish all of the great things we've started. We need to grow our tax base in Montgomery County, and the best place for us to do that, is downtown. The civic plaza project has been accompanied by some controversy, but when people start seeing that project come up out of the ground, I firmly believe they are going to be extremely proud and optimistic about the future. "We're also going to be looking at a possible expansion of our industrial park. If we need more acreage out there, that's a good thing, because it means we are filling that property up with companies that create jobs and build upon our quality of life. "At the same time, we also need to be mindful of the needs of the people in our rural areas. ," Durrett said. Troubles with county offices In the meantime he is enjoying a positive working relationship with the County Commission and county department heads. There are a few exceptions to note, including a rocky go of it with County Trustee Brenda Radford whom his office wants to locally audit after previous troubling findings by the state, much to her dismay.

Some of those issues are still ongoing as Durrett's chief of staff, Jeff Truitt, is now serving in a secondary role as interim director of Bi-County to, as officials often say, "right the ship." "When I first came into office, we had a brand-new mayor and eight brand-new commissioners. We're not always going to see eye to eye, but the great thing about this county government is that even when we disagree, we respect each other and just move on to the next project. We do business the right way," Durrett said. 10-year goal The short-term goals of his administration are hoped to yield long-range dividends. "Looking 10 years down the road, I see a major public venue in downtown Clarksville, I see a community that is even more deeply-rooted with Fort Campbell, a community that continues to be attractive for new industry and new businesses, and one that continues to grow at the rapid pace we have seen over the last decade. Buy Photo County Mayor Jim Durrett gives the opening remarks during the Clarksville-Montgomery County Memorial Day ceremony held on May 30, 2016 at the William O. Beach Civic Hall.  (Photo: Ayrika Whitney / The Leaf-Chronicle) "Our biggest growing pain continues to be infrastructure, specifically managing the traffic flows around the community. TDOT, right now, is just living from year to year. I believe the last figure I saw is that we are behind to the tune of about $6 billion in new roadwork statewide. The county commission recently passed its legislative agenda, which was focused on pressuring state legislators to fund projects to alleviate traffic congestion. "I know our county is going to continue to grow, so we're going to try to grow smart, and hopefully keep our property tax rate at a level that is suitable to all Montgomery Countians. Everything we do takes money, so we need to be good stewards of those tax dollars while providing the things for the community that will make it safer, more competitive, and more attractive," he said.

Barry Schwartz on September 16, 2016 at 9:33 am More Earlier this month, we reported about significant chatter around a Google algorithm update. Well, it looks like we have another update to report to you this week. On Tuesday of this week, there were some early signals of a Google update. Those signals intensified Thursday and seem to just be getting stronger day by day. In short, the webmaster and SEO community is confident that there was an algorithm change with the Google organic search results this week. Not only are the SEO forums and communities discussing it, the tracking tools from Mozcast, Accuranker, RankRanger and others have also shown significant fluctuations in the organic rankings in Google. Google’s PR team wouldn’t directly comment. Instead, they pointed to a tweet by John Mueller from Google: “nothing specific, sorry — we’re always working to improve things!” This is in response to questions about an algorithm update. John also said this morning on Twitter that these are normal fluctuations: @akrampathan21 @rustybrick @methode fluctuations in search are normal and a sign that our #algorithms & #engineers are working hard. — John Mueller (@JohnMu) September 16, 2016 In any event, it seems this is not directly related to the Google Penguin update we are all anxiously awaiting.

SUBSCRIBE There’s no Google Search widget for the iOS 10 Search screen: why that matters Google search could be on the iOS Search screen with a widget, if it wanted. Why isn't it offering that option to its users? Danny Sullivan on September 16, 2016 at 9:00 am More iOS 10 has made widgets much more noticeable than in past releases. That’s an opportunity for Google to regain some search attention in Apple’s mobile operating system. However, Google’s still not taking advantage of this. No Google Search for the iOS Search screen? Widgets — think of them as mini-applications that you don’t have to open to interact with — aren’t new to iOS. They’ve been around since iOS 8 was released in 2014. But with iOS 10 out this week, they’ve gained a new prominence as now being offered for the iOS “Search” screen. That’s right. iOS has a Search screen. That’s the official name of what you get when you swipe right from the Home screen, a name that’s been used since iOS 9. Widgets can now be added to the iOS Search screen. Given it’s a place expressly designed for searching, you’d think Google would want a search widget there. But so far, there isn’t one. What Google could be doing To give you an idea of what a widget could mean for Google, look at how it works for Microsoft. That’s Google’s chief search competitor in the United States. Microsoft provides a widget for its search companion, Cortana: With the Cortana widget, Microsoft lets someone to do a search directly via the iOS Search page. OK, tapping “Ask Cortana” actually just launches the Cortana app. And while I put it at the top of my screen, it wouldn’t be there for most people unless they manually moved it higher. But at least Microsoft has a search offering for that page, for iOS users who want it. Google does not. Microsoft also offers a Bing widget, though it oddly lacks a search box: That seems an oversight by Microsoft, or perhaps there’s some technical issue or outright restriction against iOS 10 widgets offering keyword searching. What Google is doing Back to Google, it’s more remarkable that it doesn’t offer a Google Search app widget when you consider that it does offer other widgets, including one for Chrome that launches voice search: Google News has a widget. Google Maps also offers at least two widgets, one for nearby transit times and another for personalized travel times: What Google has lost in search on iOS Over the years, Apple has slowly but diligently cut Google out of the iOS search ecosystem. Google was replaced by Bing as the default search provider for Siri in 2013. In 2014, Google was replaced by Bing for Spotlight Search. Google does remain the default search for Safari, despite expectations that Apple would drop it there. Still, a Google Search widget would seem a way for Google to claw back some of the exposure it has lost. That’s even more so given how the new widgets are making the iOS search screen more like Google Now with proactive suggestions. Google Now is part of the Google Search app. Some of its suggestions could flow into a Google Search widget, along with an actual search box. Then again, if most people are like those I asked about widgets on Twitter, it might not make a difference. My unscientific survey found most people aren’t using iOS widgets (Cast your own vote to see the latest results): Want to answer a question about iOS & widgets for me? Take my fast poll. Have you…. — Danny Sullivan (@dannysullivan) September 15, 2016 Bottom line: Don’t expect a Google Search widget any time soon. We did ask Google about all this, and the company said it had no comment. If you want to get started with widgets that are offered, swipe right in iOS 10, then scroll down to the very bottom of the Search screen and look for the “Edit” button. That’s where you can enable any widgets offered by apps you have installed. About The Author Danny Sullivan Danny Sullivan is a Founding Editor of Search Engine Land.

SUBSCRIBE How to manage local listings for enterprise brands Getting a handle on the data for multiple-location businesses can be a significant challenge. Columnist Brian Smith provides step-by-step guidelines to making it happen. Brian Smith on September 16, 2016 at 9:45 am More When it comes to local listings management, there’s a direct correlation between the number of listings you manage and the amount of grumbling, cursing and general hand-wringing you do. It isn’t easy for enterprise brands to get their location data in order. Juggling the info for hundreds or thousands of locations can quickly become overwhelming. And it’s not uncommon for enterprise brands to feel like they’re playing SEO whack-a-mole, constantly beating down duplicate listings, inaccurate data and any local search changes that inevitably pop up from Google. Fortunately, there are steps enterprise brands can take to tame their unruly location data and prevent it from getting out of hand in the future. The unique challenges facing enterprise local listings management For enterprise brands just starting to get their location data in order, local listings problems can typically be boiled down into two categories: an overwhelming, baffling, disparate, inaccurate and outright maddening heap of location data; and human nature’s basic resistance to change. I’ll address each of these in turn. Overwhelming location data Perhaps the biggest challenge for enterprise brands trying to manage their location data is the overwhelming number of sources that their location data comes from. A large organization will typically have multiple databases that contain various elements of location data from departments such as accounting, shipping, legal and so forth. Furthermore, while all of this data likely meets the individual needs of the department that it comes from, it’s highly unlikely that the data meets the stringent quality standards Google and the other search engines require. In other words, their location data isn’t actionable beyond their originally intended purpose. The location data problem for enterprise brands is also compounded by the fact that many of the addresses for their various locations aren’t standardized. Often, before an enterprise brand decides to bring all of their location data management under one roof, those responsible for entering location data into Google My Business and the like are the individual store managers and franchise owners. How many of those individual store managers and franchisees know how to properly format an address that Google will like? The answer: not as many as you would hope. Most people don’t put much thought into addresses beyond whether or not the mail arrives. If your mail gets to its intended location, the address must be correct, right? Not necessarily. It’s a human who delivers your mail, and, while Google is getting better at predicting user intent, they still have a way long way to go before they are on par with humans. Resistance to change The second major obstacle that enterprise brands must overcome when beginning to clean up their location data is humanity’s general resistance to change. When a corporation decides to start managing their local listings and their respective social media accounts, individual store managers and franchise owners are often reluctant to relinquish control over those accounts, especially if they’ve been managing them since day one. Franchisees, in particular, are especially resistant to relinquishing control. They will often come around when they start seeing improved rankings and more local search traffic. But that doesn’t make it any easier getting over the hump of that initial change. Large enterprise brands can also face resistance from within the corporate office itself. This is especially true if a department makes a unilateral decision to start making changes to the location data management process without consulting the rest of the company. So how do you overcome the problems of overwhelming location data and our general resistance to change? First and foremost, there must be buy-in from the top of the organization. The exec team must make it a priority to clean up the location data, and they must provide those who will actually carry out the change with a mandate that has teeth to it. Second, there should be an education period in which the coming transition is explained to the rest of the company, or at least to those the change will affect. The long-term benefit must be made apparent to the owners and managers of individual locations. But be aware, even the most eloquent explanation will still be met with resistance. However, laying some of the groundwork beforehand by doing education can help ease the transition. Consolidating your data Once you’ve got corporate buy-in and have explained the coming changes, the next step is to consolidate your location data before beginning the process of cleaning and standardizing it. The goal is to gather your location data into a single database and establish it as the single source of truth for syndicating out to aggregators and round-tripping that data back into the various departments so that they are working with accurate and up-to-date information. Standardize and cleanse your data If you have all of your location data in a single place, and you’ve established that database as your source of truth, the next step is to standardize your addresses and begin cleaning up inconsistencies. I recommend standardizing your addresses using a validator tool such as USPS ZIP + 4 or any other address tool that scales easily. However, simply because you’ve standardized your addresses doesn’t mean your addresses are necessarily correct. You’ll need to visually verify the pin placement for each and every location across Google, Foursquare, Bing, Yelp and the other third-party sites. Every. Single. Pin. Unfortunately, there’s no quick and easy way to do this. As I mentioned in a previous post, there’s no good way to automatically adjust geocode pin placement. If you find an error, you’ll have to go in and manually fix it. Visually verifying pin placement typically requires going into Google Street View and making sure the pins match with the actual location. But be careful. Sometimes Google Street View hasn’t been updated recently, and rural areas, highways and country roads can prove especially tricky when it comes to determining correct addresses and pin placement. Additionally, it’s not always easy plotting individual locations contained within larger and multi-level locations. Until indoor mapping takes off, shopping malls and skyscrapers might require you to look at the map on the location’s web page to find out where individual stores are located within the larger structure. From there, good geospatial reasoning should help you put the pin in the general vicinity. Claim duplicate and closed listings Once you’ve standardized and verified your location data, it’s time to claim rogue pages that are out there on the web representing your brand but aren’t owned by you. Keep an eye out for pages that your customers created for individual locations, as well as those that store managers or franchisees might have created. Likewise, be sure to claim any pages for closed locations, thus ensuring that they appear closed in local search results and will remain so. You don’t want these orphan pages competing against valid nearby locations for search results or leading potential customers to an empty storefront. Syndicating and the virtuous cycle Once you’ve consolidated your location data, cleaned it up and established it as your single source of truth, it’s time to focus on syndicating the data and making sure the changes you made are actually reflected in the local search ecosystem. In short, you’re looking to make sure the data you’re syndicating out has been accepted, processed and pushed out correctly. Fortunately, if you’ve made it this far into the location management process, most of the initial grunt work should be behind you and you’ve built a solid foundation for managing your local listings going forward. But the process never truly ends. As your data constantly changes and evolves, it needs to be constantly updated, syndicated and round-tripped back internally to the company. As new locations open up, treat those locations like you did during your initial cleaning: standardize them and verify their location information. Unfortunately, no matter how aggressively you keep on top of your location data, inaccurate data will inevitably crop up, and duplicate pages will emerge. As always, compare what gets created out there in the local search ecosystem to your source of truth and make adjustments accordingly. Automation My final word is on the importance of automating the local listings process (Disclaimer: I work for a local marketing automation company). While brands with only a few locations can get away with manually running the location data process, this isn’t feasible for enterprise brands. The moment you throw a few hundred or a few thousand locations into the mix, your location data gets so complex and overwhelming that it becomes a nightmare. Fortunately, if you’re an enterprise brand, the necessities of the digital age make it likely that you’re already automating at least some parts of this process. Continue down that path. As location data becomes more critical to things like location-based advertising, augmented reality and tracking the ROI of store visits, the need for automation will only increase.

Resend activation e-mail Law & Disorder / Civilization & Discontents How the feds used Internet searches to find 5 child pornography victims Let me Google that for you: EXIF data and public Internet used to crack open case. by Nate Anderson - Sep 16, 2016 3:30 pm UTC Login to bookmark 74 Postal inspectors routinely investigate child pornography cases in the US. Joshua Lot/Getty Images In 2013, US federal agents investigating the child pornography collection of one David S. Engle—who was later sentenced in Washington state to 25 years in prison—came across a new set of eight images. The pictures showed five boys, ranging in age from around seven to 15, urinating outdoors, shaving their pubic hair, and posing naked in bathtubs. According to an affidavit from Postal Inspector Maureen O'Sullivan, who helped investigate the images, the photo set was "emerging and being widely distributed and traded by child pornography collectors on a national and international scale." Being new and uncatalogued, the images were forwarded to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC), which maintains a vast database on prohibited images for use in investigations and image blacklists. While law enforcement generally focuses on finding those who create and/or trade child pornography, a simultaneous effort is made to identify—and if necessary to secure—the victims. At the federal level, this task is centralized within NCMEC at the Child Victim Identification Program (CVIP)—and this new image set wound up at CVIP accordingly. The investigation of the pictures, which took three years to complete, opens a rare window into the world of digital detectives who specialize in tracing some of the world's most horrific imagery. It turns out that federal agents largely run an investigation the way most of us would: on the public Internet. An Embassy Suites hotel room—but which one? CVIP took the obvious first step and pulled all the Exchangeable Image File (EXIF) metadata from the photos. Amazingly, this data had never been scrubbed (even Facebook scrubs EXIF metadata from uploaded photos for security and privacy reasons). Though the images were not tagged with GPS locations, they did have dates attached. This would become a crucial clue. Without names and dates, finding the photos' creator would be difficult. Even if one could identify a particular hotel used in a photo, the huge number of possible dates would make guest check-in registries nearly worthless. But with a date, identifying a particular hotel might solve the case immediately. To that end, CVIP agents looked through a subset of the pictures that had been taken in a hotel room on August 20, 2010. Background items suggested a location in Colorado, while the décor of the room hinted at an Embassy Suites hotel. To find out which hotel, CVIP "compared rooms in the images to online photos of hotel rooms in all of the Embassy Suites in the area." (This sounds like either a Google image search or a careful look at the Embassy Suites website.) The team decided that the location was the Embassy Suites in Denver. The information was sent back to the postal inspectors, who fired off a subpoena to Embassy Suites for everyone registered at a "small subset of the hotel's rooms" on the date in question. However, the registry turned up no clear leads. The trail went cold. Let me Google that for you In February 2015, CVIP came back to the postal inspectors with new data. Unrelated investigations around the country had turned up additional images from the set, showing the same boys in Western locations, many outdoors. James Parkhurst UMCEXIF data revealed that these photos were taken two days earlier than the others, and one additional boy was now pictured. More importantly, "a particular landmark" in the new photos offered a specific location: a cabin within the Antero Hot Springs cabins in Salida, Colorado. In March 2015, the owner of the cabins sent postal inspectors information on guest rentals from the time. On the day the photos there had been taken, the cabin in question had been rented to "James Parkhurst" and three guests. Rather than delving into some super-secret law enforcement database, agents turned to Google and Facebook to ID Parkhurst. Quick searches revealed a 55-year-old man with the same name who lived in Portland and was working as the Executive Director of Camp and Retreat Ministries for the United Methodist Church's Oregon-Idaho Conference. A search of Facebook pages belonging to Parkhurst showed conversations about trips to national parks with boys he knew—along with names and (non-sexual) photos of the five boys pictured in the prohibited image series. The full Facebook This discovery led to an August 2015 search warrant for the Facebook accounts of Parkhurst and of the boys. Cross-referencing the conversations and pictures returned by the social network with the prohibited images and their EXIF data, investigators sketched out specific dates and times during which Parkhurst appeared to be on trips alone with the boys in locations matching those in the prohibited photos. For instance, the earliest photos dated to August 2008, when Parkhurst allegedly took all five boys on a trip to Las Vegas, the Hoover Dam, and Yosemite National Park. As part of that trip, the group stopped at Travertine Hot Springs and Buckeye Hot Springs. Inspectors found references to both places on a public website devoted to naturism ("nudity is commonplace"). Another stop, at El Dorado Hot Springs, was listed on a separate site as one of the "best places for nude camping in Arizona." With another prohibited image, investigators used "public search engines" to identify a particular hotel in Mariposa, California. As confirmation of the location, traveler pictures on a "hotel review website" matched the bathroom amenities and décor in the prohibited photo. Still more images were identified based on "landmarks that are searchable on Google" or by matching one pond to "an online image of the Olympic Hot Springs in Olympic Park, Washington." Travertine Hot Springs in California. gastondog Revenge of the thumbnail Several of the photos from the set were circulating among child pornography collectors in cropped versions, with the pictures usually altered to remove an adult or to focus attention on the genitals. But the crops didn't hide the original image completely. Investigators found that several of the image files still held thumbnail versions of the original image. One of these smaller but un-cropped images showed, in O'Sullivan's words, "Parkhurst nude next to [one of the boys]." Secret databases Assembling the case against Parkhurst eventually moved beyond open source information. Law enforcement periodically busts allegedly "legitimate" businesses selling things like "naturist films from around the world" that are actually child pornography. When that happens, investigators seize and archive all sales records for future investigations. For instance, in 2006, postal inspectors and the Los Angeles police raided Insider Video Club, which dealt in "DVDs, VHS tapes, and still images of nude men and boys"; the company's database was then seized. And in October 2010, Toronto police shut down Azov Films, which specialized in this material, and they sent a copy of the sales database to the US. As part of the Parkhurst investigation, postal inspectors ran his name against these kinds of sales databases—and found hits at both Azov and Insider Video Club. Parkhurst had allegedly ordered Swim Party for $24.95 back in 1997 and Boys in the Mud in 2005 for $45.95. Each video showed nude young boys and contained "no meaningful dialogue or storyline." Each video had been sent directly to Parkhurst's address. Federal Judge Youlee Yim You.But it was a third "ping" against a sensitive database that appears to have kicked the investigation into urgent mode. Postal inspectors plugged away on the Parkhurst case all the way through to July 2016, when they realized that Parkhurst had ongoing contact with the boys in the images—and that he had another trip coming up. A law enforcement sensitive database revealed that Parkhurst had booked tickets to Europe for himself and one of the boys. The trip would begin on August 3. On August 1, Postal Inspector O'Sullivan took a search warrant to Federal Judge Youlee Yim You in Portland, had it signed, and assembled her team. They raided Parkhurst's home the next morning. According to O'Sullivan, the search team found some of the prohibited images on "one or more" of Parkhurst's digital devices. Parkhurst then agreed to speak to investigators. He allegedly admitted that he had taken the photos, acknowledged masturbating to at least some of them, but denied that he engaged in sexual activity with the boys. Parkhurst also suggested that his collection of nude images would not "qualify as child pornography." (US child pornography law actually includes a clause banning "lascivious exhibition of the genitals or pubic area" as a way to short-circuit any "but I didn't actually touch them!" defense.) Parkhurst was arrested. According to the Oregonian, he resigned from his job and surrendered his ministerial credentials a few days later. He was eventually transferred to Denver, where he will stand trial. He had his first court appearance there this week. Creative searching While the Internet has enabled an explosion in child pornography—an issue that was largely under control in the analog era, thanks to the difficulty and expense of finding, creating, printing, and distributing it—it at least makes investigations simpler, too. Even though law enforcement has access to expensive or secret databases, many of the Parkhurst investigation leads were based on EXIF data and publicly available Internet pages. Google, Facebook, hotel review and naturist websites, online maps, and image searches—it's all grist for the mill. Once a hotel or cabin has been located, once a person has been ID'd on Facebook, once a trip is suspected, then it's time for the subpoena, the warrant, or the secret database. Still, with all of the tech, search, and monitoring tools available to authorities today, one of the most useful investigative skills remains the ability to use the public Internet creatively.

By Sarah Baker Friday, September 16, 2016 Sign in to favorite this Discuss Comment, Blog about Share this Email, Facebook, Twitter Beginning this fall, Baker University has renewed its subscription to Turnitin, a controversial plagiarism detection software, to aid faculty and students in the discovery and prevention of plagiarism on campus. About Turnitin The Turnitin website markets the product as “technology to improve student writing” that was created in the late 1990s. Turnitin’s Feedback Studio says it has amassed a collection of more than 600 million student papers. Word Around Baker What do you think should be the punishment for a student's first plagiarism offense? More Approximately five years ago, Baker University used a licensed plagiarism-detection software, but because of budget concerns, discontinued the service. Since then, faculty members have voiced their desire to have an equitable and consistent tool for finding and assessing incidents of student plagiarism. Despite Turnitin’s success in college spheres over the years, the software has received mixed reviews. There have been some law cases, like Vanderhye v. iParadigms LLC, featuring students who have refused to submit their papers to the program – all submitted papers are saved to an external database to which another party could have access – on the grounds Turnitin is violating their copyright and privacy rights. Both a district and an appeals courts affirmed Turnitin was in the right under fair use - using the papers in a new and innovative way. Fearing the potential for future lawsuits, though, some colleges have either banned the entire service or have incorporated a policy exempting students from being required to submit work if they choose not to. Students have also posted on various forums – such as YouTube comment sections and Reddit feeds – saying that they have failed an assignment, or been asked to rewrite work, due to a large percentage of their paper being flagged as plagiarism, when they say they did not plagiarize and that it was due to professor and/or software error. Some students’ posts suggest that the professor-errors are a result of a lack of knowledge of how the software works, and the system-errors stem from a computer not understanding the circumstances or context in which the flagged portions are set. When a paper is submitted, the Turnitin software flags any instance of possible plagiarism, including quotes, the bibliography source, required/standard subject heading, article names and amount of similarity to other papers. It then calculates a percentage of the submitted work that is plagiarized or similar to other works. A blog post published by Turnitin on its website stated its response to such student claims: “ There is a very distinct difference between what Turnitin flags as matching text (aka: similarity index) and plagiarism. Turnitin will highlight any matching material in a paper - even if it is properly quoted and cited. Just because it appears as unoriginal does not mean it is plagiarized; it just means that the material matches something in the Turnitin databases. We leave it to the instructors to look at a paper and the originality report to make the determination of whether or not something is plagiarism, and to what extent - intentional plagiarism, unintentional plagiarism, improper/lack of citation or mere coincidence. Best practices from instructors suggest that Turnitin OriginalityCheck be used as a teaching tool to address citation and academic honesty, not only as a punitive tool .” Spurred by this controversy, Susan Schorn, a writing flag coordinator at the University of Texas in Austin, was inspired to conduct a study about the effectiveness of both Turnitin and UT’s plagiarism detection software of choice, SafeAssign, in discovering plagiarism. She started her study in 2007 and conducted a follow-up in 2015. Schorn’s experiment began with a sample of test essays with 23 commonly-cited sources among humanities courses, including various levels of plagiarism. During her study, Schorn concluded that Google searches surpassed both systems in the amount of copied material detected and simplicity of use. Although, both systems could outperform Google in collusion, or similarity, of papers, for the 23 plagiarized sources in the papers – which were strategically placed there by Schorn and her colleagues based on common methods they saw in students’ papers – Google, again, surpassed both systems in the amount of correctly-found plagiarism with 91.3 percent. Turnitin and SafeAssign found 60.76 and 43.4 percent, respectively. Schorn’s data suggests that while Turnitin is more effective than competing software, it is not as effective as manual Google searches. The overall effectiveness and usefulness of Turnitin as a plagiarism detection software may be up to colleges, faculty and students to determine themselves. Turnitin at Baker How this software will affect Baker University has yet to be seen, considering it is the start of the year and Faculty Senate is currently in the process of amending Baker’s academic misconduct and plagiarism policies to include more strict measures of dealing with dishonesty. Mass Media and Visual Arts Department Chair Joe Watson said that Baker is not requiring faculty and students to use Turnitin, but faculty members do have it available as a tool to detect and prevent plagiarism. “There is no policy that says Baker faculty have to use this software,” Watson said. “I am sure there are going to be some of my colleagues that don’t want to use it, and if they don’t want to, they don’t have to.” Watson says that he is passionate about plagiarism, and he will spend a lot of time trying to find it if he suspects it in a student paper. He knows that Turnitin is not perfect, but he sees it as a valuable teaching tool for students to learn how to avoid plagiarizing. “Frankly, I plan to use [Turnitin] as a tool,” he said. “One of the things I want to do is have students turn in drafts, so that if there is something that raises a flag, they have the opportunity to change it. I find no pleasure in finding plagiarism. Telling a student that I found plagiarism in one of their papers is one of the most painful things I do as a professor … If there is a tool that I can use in one of my classes that students could use to submit a draft and catch something like, ‘Oh, my gosh! I forgot to cite that! Or ‘I forgot a quotation mark!’ – things like that do happen – and students can avoid it and clean it up before they turn in a final version, I am all for that.” Acknowledging the issues of professors not understanding the program fully, Watson said that the Baker faculty has set up training sessions where faculty learn how to use the software correctly. Watson knows that a computer-generated software like Turnitin still needs a human element to be most effectively used. “I think with any software system, nothing is ever going to be perfect. It is important how you use it,” he said. “If the computer software messes up, I am not going to hold [students] accountable for that. I think that, like with anything, you have to learn how to use it and not abuse it … You have to include a human element, not just take the report and use it verbatim. It will produce a report but you have to use your own common sense to read the report and apply it as you see fit.” Watson said he is looking forward to implementing the Turnitin software in his classes in the coming weeks as both a teaching tool and a way to lift the burden of his plagiarism hunting. “Something I am excited about is that this takes the burden off me as a professor. I can submit it, wait for the report to come back, read the paper, look at the report and make a judgment. I am sure there are things that might be better, but it’s all in how you use it.” Agreeing with Watson, senior English literature major Kristen Robbs thinks that Turnitin could be a good source for helping students understand plagiarism. “I also know that sometimes plagiarism can be hard to understand. Especially working as a writing tutor, I can see how hard it can be to understand how to take someone else’s ideas and use them to support your own without taking credit for their work,” Robbs said. “I think this software is a good start to physically demonstrating what plagiarism is and opening students’ eyes to ways they may be plagiarizing and not realize it. For underclassmen in particular, it could really up the learning curve on knowing how to write a research paper with your personal opinion as well as the opinions of others.” Robbs is familiar with software like this and thinks it is a helpful tool for both students and faculty. Her father was a teacher and used this software to check his students’ work. “My dad has used this program before as a teacher, and it was helpful for him to be able to double-check on papers that seemed off,” Robbs said. “Sometimes it would frustrate him to see how students would try to get away with blatant plagiarism. "I think it’s a nice tool to have at the school’s disposal, both for professors and students, and will help identify and improve on plagiarism problems, but it must be used wisely and, especially initially, with a dose of grace; otherwise, it could turn into a case of guilty until proven innocent.” More like this story Honesty always the best policy Wikipedia (The Wiki-Whack Way to Research) Plagiarism crucial issue in classroom, workplace Baker University gaming program ranked by Princeton Review Sports Illustrated gets a plus-sized remodeling Comments Use the comment form below to begin a discussion about this content.

Plenty of people are giving "Google Teat View" a hard time after Guardian editor David Shariatmadari noticed the software that automatically blurs people's faces in close-ups on Google Street View had also blurred the face of a cow in Cambridge, UK. Following the lead of many on Twitter, Google decided to laugh it off. "We thought you were pulling the udder one when we herd the moos, but it's clear that our automatic face-blurring technology has been a little overzealous," the company says, per the BBC. "Of course, we don't begrudge this cow milking its five minutes of fame." One guy suggests the cow needed to keep its identity hidden because it "had a restraining order against the Burger King." (Two guys staged a Street View "murder.")

A Mobify technology approach that builds on the success of Responsive Web Design, Progressive Mobile provides two to four times faster page load speeds, improving overall user experience and ensuring that customers can complete transactions faster. Faster website load times and page speeds have become essential to eCommerce: according to Facebook, 40% of customers leave if a page takes three seconds to load, yet the average U.S. retail mobile site loaded in 6.9 seconds, as Google reported in July 2016. According to Mobify's analysis of large volumes of data amassed from ecommerce sites in Q2 2016, slow page speeds interfere with mobile customer engagement, contributing to an unsatisfying web performance through poor user experience and interrupted mobile moments. With Progressive Mobile, the world of the mobile web and native apps is converging, with apps and mobile-optimized web managed as one unified customer experience. "Progressive enhancement is compelling to retailers because it leverages the investments they've made and makes them better," said Mobify CEO Igor Faletski. "Progressive Mobile brings a fast, app-quality experience to web visitors, leading to conversion rates comparable to desktop." With Mobify Progressive Mobile Web, retailers can provide seamless shopper experiences across mobile screens, including: High-speed performance with faster page load times for higher conversions Shopping pages optimized for conversions with product category, listing, and display pages, cart and checkout all designed to provide a smooth pat to conversions App-like experiences for web such as push notifications and offline mode, which allows shoppers to continue browsing in areas with poor -- or no -- wifi. Growth in customer lifetime value from lower friction re-engagement To learn more about implementing Mobify Progressive Web, visit https://www.mobify.com/platform/progressive-mobile/ About Mobify  Mobify has invented The Mobify™ Platform, the leading mobile customer engagement solution for retailers and brands that want to boost revenues, keep up with customer expectations, and protect their competitive edge. The core of Mobify's platform is Progressive Mobile,™ which replaces isolated point-solutions by uniting in a single platform web, apps, and engagement marketing such as push notifications and store foot traffic drivers. Leading global brands including Lancome, Burlington, Dollar Tree, Matalan, BT, Crocs, Carnival Cruises, Bosch, Superdry, Eddie Bauer and Tommy Bahama generate extensive revenue through The Mobify Platform and rely on Mobify to grow their customer lifetime value. www.mobify.com Contact Information Contact: Betsy Kosheff 413-232-7057 Email Contact   View Desktop Version Pour voir la version complète

Here's the answer: If the Facebook Inc. (Nasdaq: FB) stock split is anything like the Alphabet Inc. (Nasdaq: GOOG, GOOGL) stock split, it won't happen until 2018. The Facebook stock split faces similar issues as Google did before it could split its stock. This is why it could take so long… Why the Facebook Stock Split Could Take Two Years In 2012, Google co-founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page controlled nearly 70% of the voting power for Google, now known as Alphabet. But because the tech giant had been criticized for its long-term projects that lose money – like its "Other Bets" sector – the founders wanted to make sure they could always run the company without putting all of their focus into short-term growth. In a 2012 shareholder letter, Page said that he and Brin wanted to protect Google from outside pressures that wanted the company to sacrifice future opportunities because of short-term demands. What Are Google's Other Bets? Google's advertising business is extremely successful. In Q2 2016, ad revenue netted Google $7 billion in profit on $21 billion in revenue. But Google's "Other Bets" sector is currently losing massive amounts of money. Other Bets generated $185 million in revenue. But it lost $859 million. This part of Google’s business includes smart-thermostat maker Nest, life science research organization Verily, the high-speed Internet unit Google Fiber, and projects in self-driving cars and Internet balloons. Even though Brin and Page controlled the majority of the company, activist investors could acquire enough stake in Google to try and pressure Brin and Page to change Google's long-term plans. Don't Miss: This is your ticket to bigger and better returns… and it won't cost you a penny. What are you waiting for? Read more… For example, activist investment firm Starboard Value LP only owned a 1.7% stake in Yahoo! Inc. (Nasdaq: YHOO) as of March, according to Reuters. But because of constant pressure from Starboard to unlock more shareholder value, Yahoo gave up four board seats to the activist investment firm at the end of April. So in order to keep voting power and do what Brin and Page thought was best for the company, the duo announced a plan for a 2-for-1 stock split on April 12, 2012. Every shareholder would get two shares of GOOG for each share they already owned. But before the split could happen, a pension fund sued Google. It claimed that the 2-for-1 stock split Google proposed was unethical. The lawsuit alleged Brin and Page were insulating themselves from the voices of common shareholders. In June 2013, Google settled with the plaintiffs before going to court. The lawsuit, though, caused the split to be delayed until April 3, 2014. And just like Google, Facebook is being sued over its stock split. Trending: How to Buy Bitcoins A shareholder filed a class-action lawsuit against Facebook on April 30. The lawsuit claims the Facebook stock split is unfair to shareholders because shareholders don't receive any value from the split. Zuckerberg gets to retain control of the company even while he sells off his shares to support his Chan Zuckerberg Initiative. Zuckerberg will have to fight or settle this lawsuit before the official Facebook stock split date can be set. If it takes Facebook as long as Google to settle the lawsuit, the stock split could be delayed until 2018. And we don't want Money Morning readers waiting until then to purchase more shares of FB.

The back-and-forth between the two web giants began in June when Microsoft showed that Edge outlasted not only Chrome, but Opera and Firefox as well when all were running on the same type of PC. Google retaliated last week, using the latest version of Chrome to prove that it came out on top in battery life. But now Microsoft is back, again claiming to be the best. As Microsoft looks to prove the efficiency of its Edge browser and Windows 10 as a whole (especially with the recent Anniversary Update), it points out that Google’s test last week was merely a comparison between an older version of Chrome and the latest release. It did not compare the browser against any other competitors, including Edge. So, Microsoft has gone a re-created Google’s test, using the exact same Vimeo clip and setting it to loop on the same hardware (a Surface Book), but also including Opera and Firefox as well. Here were the results: Edge: 13:25:49 Chrome: 12:08:28 Opera: 9:37:23 Firefox: 8:16:49 But Microsoft went a step further and even re-created its battery test from June, which relied on looping a video streamed from Netflix as opposed to Vimeo. To little surprise, the test showed that Edge again came out on top: Edge: 8:47:06 Opera 7:08:58 Chrome 6:03:54 Firefox 5:11:34 While these tests may or may not be very reflective of everyday use in real world situations, it’s clear that Microsoft is desperate to prove that Edge is a major player, if not the best, in Windows 10 browser market. The company is even opening up the testing process for anyone to try, putting the exact test used on GitHub, and detailing the methodology that was followed.

Shopify made a change where users can now easily check their past orders by viewing their Shopify confirmation page. The Shopify confirmation page has the conversion pixels, which can lead to the pixel firing off and "double counting of your conversion within AdWords," Google added. So these Shopify users should make an update. They need to update your conversion tags to include the Order ID.

Photograph: Evan Vucci/AP Donald Trump attempted to finally resolve an issue that is thought to have caused him significant damage with minority voters by admitting that Barack Obama was born in the US after years of promoting false claims that the US president was born in Kenya. But the Republican presidential candidate continued to falsely claim that his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton was behind the conspiracy theory. Clinton spoke only a few blocks away at the Black Women’s Agenda symposium, held at a downtown hotel. Clinton said that “there is no erasing” Trump’s role in spreading the “birther” gospel. “For five years he has led the birther movement to delegitimize our first black president,” she said. “His campaign was founded on this outrageous lie. “He is feeding into the worst impulses, the bigotry and bias, that lurks in our country. Barack Obama was born in America, plain and simple, and Donald Trump owes him and the American people an apology.” Speaking in Virginia, first lady Michelle Obama told an audience of college students that criticism of her husband’s birthplace have been a constant companion since 2008, without mentioning Trump’s name. “There were those who questioned and continued to question for the past eight years and to this day whether my husband was even born in this country,” she said, alluding to the Republican nominee without mentioning him by name. Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson and Jill Stein of the Green party will not be allowed to take part in the first televised debate of the race for the White House,the Commission on Presidential Debates (CPD) announced today. Johnson, once a Republican governor of New Mexico, has pinned his hopes on taking part in the debates. He and Stein, however, fell well short of the 15% national polling average required to participate. Donald Trump today named one of the nation’s top anti-abortion activists to his campaign coalition, in the clearest signal yet that the presidential candidate has fully embraced Republicans’ typically harsh stance against abortion. Marjorie Dannenfelser, the president of Susan B Anthony List, a group that works to elect Republican, anti-abortion women, will chair the loose coalition of conservative, anti-abortion rights leaders who are working to elect the Republican nominee. Trump’s campaign also announced that he would commit to a law banning public funding of abortion.

Photograph: UPI / Barcroft Images Speaking at a campaign rally in Miami, Florida, Trump criticized Clinton’s stance on gun-control issues, characterizing her stance as wanting to “abolish” the Second Amendment of the US Constitution, which protects the right to keep and bear arms. (This claim has been debunked.) If Clinton were truly as anti-gun as she claims to be, Trump told the audience, her Secret Service detail should disarm itself. “I think that her bodyguards should drop all weapons - they should disarm. I think they should disarm immediately, what do you think?” Trump asked the raucous crowd. “Let’s see what happens to her.” Trump was deeply criticized in August after suggesting at a rally in Wilmington, North Carolina, that gunowners could take the Second Amendment into their own hands if Clinton were elected and began nominating Supreme Court justices. “Hillary wants to abolish, essentially abolish, the Second Amendment,” Trump said at the time. “If she gets to pick her judges, nothing you can do, folks. Although the second amendment people, maybe there is, I don’t know. But I’ll tell you what, that will be a horrible day.” The remarks were seen by many - including the Democratic nominee herself - as hinting at calling for Clinton’s assassination, or that of her judicial nominees.

Inevitable chants of USA! USA! follow. He returns to address the crowd in Spanish, and the audience is notably quieter. Even a mention of Marco Rubio, the Florida senator and former Trump opponent in the primary race who is hugely popular around these parts, raised barely a ripple. But other speakers, conservative commentator AJ Delgado, a senior Trump campaign adviser born to Cuban-immigrant parents, and Carlos Curbelo, a Republican congressman from South Miami who has until now been lukewarm on his support for Trump, got the crowd fired up again, with the now-familiar “Hillary lied” narrative. Cue shouts of “lock her up, lock her up!”Trump is in the house and on stage imminently, and the auditorium is now full.

I want my president to be respected,” he said. “Obama? He went to Cuba and nobody waited on him. We need a stronger president. We need Donald Trump.” The arena at the James L Knight centre, however, was filling up slowly, with plenty of room still in the bleachers with Trump scheduled on stage in less than half an hour. Perhaps the rival attraction of a Friday night Kanye West concert a stone’s thrown away was more of a draw. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 4.36pm EDT 16:36 Lauren Gambino The choice for president is “excruciatingly clear”, First Lady Michelle Obama said during her campaign trail debut, urging the college audience to support Hillary Clinton this November. Obama cast the election as a choice between “one of the most qualified people who has ever endeavored to become president” and someone who doesn’t “take the job seriously”. Ticking off a list of accomplishments of her husband’s administration, Obama argued that with the past eight years as a guide, Trump is neither prepared nor qualified to be president. Michelle Obama. Photograph: Manuel Balce Ceneta/AP “A candidate is not going to suddenly change when they get into office – it’s the opposite,” Obama told the crowd of mostly students and young people at George Mason University in Virginia. “In fact, because the minute that individual takes that oath, they are under the hottest, harshest light there is.” She referenced her moving speech at the Democratic National Convention, “when they go low, we go high,” going after the Republican nominee without mentioning his name. “Being president isn’t anything like reality TV,” she said, drawing loud cheers and applause. Obama recalled the 2008 campaign, reminding the audience that raising questions about a president’s experience, qualifications and judgments is all part of a very public vetting process to be president. “And then there were those who questioned and continued to question for the past eight years and to this day whether my husband was even born in this country,” she said, alluding to the Republican nominee without mentioning him by name. Trump helped fan the flames of birtherism, a conspiracy theory that President Obama was not born in the US but in Kenya, and used the issue to help propel his political ambitions. Facing dismal approval ratings among minority voters, Trump admitted on Friday morning for the first time that Barack Obama was born in the US. Obama is a powerful and popular ally for Clinton, especially among young voters. New polling shows that millennials, disappointed by their options for president have turned toward third-party candidates. The First Lady’s appearance on a college campus in the battleground state of Virginia, the First Lady’s event is part of a broader push by the Clinton campaign to win back some of the millennial voters who have strayed in recent weeks. Next week, Senator Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, the Democratic challenger whose campaign was powered by young people and students, will campaign for Clinton in the coming days. “Elections aren’t just about who votes but who doesn’t vote,” she said, imploring the young people in the crowd to support Clinton. She encouraged them to fight the urge to want to “hide under the bed” and avoid the election altogether. She also addressed a complaint many young people who felt inspired by Sander’s underdog campaign have leveled at Clinton. “I hear folks saying they don’t feel inspired in this election,” Obama said. “Well let me tell you, I disagree.

The crowd broke into a raucous round of chanting: “Four more years” chant. “No,” Obama protested, waving her hand at the crowd as the chant continued. “No!” “I promise you,” she said, “Barack and I will continue to work for you for the rest of our lives.” Updated at 4.51pm EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 4.16pm EDT 16:16 Donald Trump’s campaign is attempting to prove the false allegation that Hillary Clinton’s 2008 presidential campaign ignited the birther rumors about then-opponent Barack Obama’s citizenship with an interview transcript from a CNN phoner with Clinton’s former campaign manager.

At the time of its creation, the leaders of those two parties made no effort to hide the fact that they didn’t want any third party intrusions into their shows.” “The CPD may scoff at a ticket that enjoys ‘only’ 9 or 10% in their hand-selected polls, but even 9% represents 13 million voters, more than the total population of Ohio and most other states. Yet, the Republicans and Democrats are choosing to silence the candidate preferred by those millions of Americans.” “It is unfortunate that the CPD doesn’t believe such a voice should be heard.

The Commission on Presidential Debates released a statement officially declaring that Clinton, Trump and their running mates will be the only people to appear in the first two debates: The Board determined that the polling averages called for... are as follows: Hillary Clinton (43%), Donald Trump (40.4%), Gary Johnson (8.4%) and Jill Stein (3.2%). Accordingly, Hillary Clinton and her running mate, Tim Kaine, and Donald Trump and his running mate, Mike Pence, qualify to participate in the September 26 presidential debate and the October 4 vice-presidential debate, respectively. No other candidates satisfied the criteria for inclusion. The composition of the final two presidential debates will be decided upon polling in the future.

Box 964, Chiloquin, OR 97624 ← Man wielding meat cleaver slices New York City patrolman’s head Wade’s Wetback Target → YouTube Has Quietly Begun “Censoring” Journalists Who Criticize Government Posted on September 16, 2016 by Joe from MassPrivateI Anti-Media – by Alice Salles Earlier this month, YouTube, the behemoth video-sharing website was accused of censoring users. Claiming some of their videos had been barred from making money through the company’s ad services, YouTube hosts like Philip DeFranco spoke out against the policy, claiming over “a dozen of his videos had been flagged as inappropriate for advertising, including one dinged for ‘graphic content or excessive strong language.’“   In a video entitled “YouTube Is Shutting Down My Channel and I’m Not Sure What To Do,” DeFranco called YouTube’s policy “censorship with a different name,” since users touching on what the company considers to be controversial subjects end up losing money. “If you do this on the regular, and you have no advertising,” DeFranco added, “it’s not sustainable.” While YouTube has already confirmed its policy regarding what it considers unfit for monetization hasn’t changed, the issue might lie elsewhere now that the company seems more efficient in enforcing its own rules. As a matter of fact, the content policy changed in 2012, when YouTube first introduced its “ad-friendly” guidelines. But while an algorithm is allegedly used to spot and “de-monetize” videos that break the company’s rules, many continue to accuse the company, currently owned by Google, of having “vague” descriptions of what its leadership considers ad-friendly. YouTube rolled out its monetization tool in 2006, when ads consisted of videos that would pop up at the bottom of the user’s screen. If the user did not click on it, it would roll for about ten seconds before going away. But as ad executivespressured YouTube to “to do a better job at promoting its creators,” the relationship with its advertisers changed. As better and even more intrusive ads were added to YouTube videos, the company allegedly became more concerned with the content. Those who are affected often complain about copyright claims, but some complain about another type of targeting — one that involves power players. YouTube Content Creators Speak Out Derrick J. Freeman, the host of FR33MANTV, told Anti-Media that he monetizes all of his videos, “and every day some video — even much older ones — gets slapped with some kind of warning or another because of music playing in the background somewhere. Usually a public place.” While Freeman’s work is often political in nature, he hasn’t seen any of his videos being flagged for breaking YouTube’s rules concerning subjects related to war or political conflicts. Mat Bars, another YouTube user, also complained about copyright claims. Asked about the alleged censorship problem, Bars told Anti-Media that “what it really most likely comes down to is advertisers not wanting their ads to be associated with certain things.” To the YouTube host, the company is “mostly blameless in this. The site isn’t even profitable, so letting advertisers push them around like this suits their best interests.” Instead of complaining about censorship, Bars added that what affects him personally is “the copyright system.” But to more radical political figures who gather a considerable number of followers on YouTube, things are slightly differently. To Luke Rudkowski, the man behind the popular channel We Are Change, YouTube’s policy of nixing monetization on some of his most popular videos has been a problem for a long time. “For years,” he told The Anti-Media, “I have monetized and still get f*cked from it.” Especially, he continued, “[when I launch a video about] Hillary, or war and foreign policy.” When his videos touch on drugs or guns, however, he says ads remain in place. “When the videos only have ‘Hillary Clinton’ they do fine,” he added, “however, when we add ‘FBI’, that’s when YouTube” springs into action. Anti-Media journalist and senior editor Carey Wedler got her start on Youtube and has had a similar experience with herchannel. She explained the first time she realized the site had singled out her videos was “a couple of weeks” after she “posted a video about how America’s culture of militarism is an underlying contributor to domestic mass shootings.” She continued: “The video was released shortly after the Orlando shooting, which occurred in June. By July 6, I had received an email saying the video was not ‘advertiser friendly.’ Two days later, I received another email about a video I released at the beginning of June — before I released the mass shooting video. This video, which pointed out inconsistencies in Bernie Sanders’s record and questioned his ‘revolutionary’ status, was also stripped of monetization.” While the mass shooting video’s monetization has been restored without her appealing the company’s decision, her Sanders video remains ineligible. The Sanders video focused largely on his record of supporting war and the military-industrial complex. Her other videos affected by YouTube’s policy include “What Every American Needs to Know About Radical Islam,” a video “that challenged rampant Islamophobia and jingoism right after the Paris terror attacks last November,” and “Why I’m “Ready for Hillary!,” which the creator claims to be an “extremely sarcastic indictment of Hillary Clinton published before she announced her candidacy early last year.” Other videos by Wedler that suffered the same fate include “How America ‘wins’ the wars in Syria & Iraq” and “How I became a “self-hating Jew.” All of the de-monetized videos contain anti-war sentiments. According to the prolific writer and vlogger, YouTube only bothered to email her notifications regarding the changes in monetization for the Sanders and the mass shooting videos: “I noticed the [other] videos had all been stripped of monetization when I logged into Youtube to check out the two that had been officially flagged. However, when I checked my settings following receipt of the two emails regarding mass shootings and Bernie, my overall monetization setting had been switched off — meaning none of my videos were monetized.” She claims to have “never selected that option” prior to learning about the issues with the videos mentioned previously, yet when she turned the monetization option back on, “the monetization reactivated — but only for videos that hadn’t been specifically flagged.” “I also noticed that my videos before the self-hating Jew video hadn’t been rejected for monetization at all,”  she said. In cases involving YouTube’s decision to flag her videos that included notifications, Wedler added, YouTube failed to give her “a specific reason as to why the videos were stripped of monetization. I’ve seen some screenshots of those emails from other Youtubers … and some contain reasons. Mine didn’t, though it’s pretty clear to me that in my case, it’s because they are considered ‘controversial.’ Some discuss war and some contain images of war, and they are always questioning military violence.” While Wedler agrees that this type of policy is “not direct censorship … it does amount to an implicit attempt to discourage me and others from saying controversial things.” She added that while YouTube is a “privately owned company that can decide which content is appropriate for its advertisers, … if they are deciding [which of] my videos shouldn’t be allowed to generate revenue, they are effectively removing much of my incentive to continue producing content on the platform.” Despite the company’s policy, Wedler vows to continue making these videos simply because the message is what matters. Google and Its Addiction to Buying Influence As Wedler stated, YouTube is a private company and it has the right to set its own policies. But it’s undeniable that the site’s owner, Google, has, on a number of occasions, shown its favoritism through lobbying, prompting many to highlight the company’s appearance of favorable bias toward Democratic Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. Google went from spending $80,000 on lobbying in 2003 to over $16 million in 2014. After 2014, Google, Inc. becameAlphabet, and in 2015, Alphabet invested over $16 million in lobbying. To date, the company has spent over $8 million on Washington politicians. Alphabet’s top recipient this election cycle is, unsurprisingly, Hillary Clinton. But despite its knack for influence buying, Google has, over the years, created relationships with think tanks that would have criticized the tech giant’s crony capitalist ways under different circumstances. According to the Washington Post, Google has embarked on a quest to woo free market organizations by populating “elite think-tanks such as the Cato Institute, the Competitive Enterprise Institute and the New America Foundation” with its fellows, including “young lawyers, writers and thinkers paid by the company.” From the Post: “To critics, Google’s investments have effectively shifted the national discussion away from Internet policy questions that could affect the company’s business practices. Groups that might ordinarily challenge the policies and practices of a major corporation are holding their fire, those critics say.” Claiming to be defenders of privacy, Google successfully waged an aggressive lobbying campaign within Washington to defeat a congressional effort that could have put Google in the middle of a very nasty antitrust fight. After supporting the European Union’s antitrust prosecution of Microsoft, Google found itself the target of the same type of scrutiny, being accused of unfairly discriminating against users. With the excuse of going after companies like Google for antitrust law violations, Congress came up with the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA), a bill disguised as an anti-online piracy fix that would have allowed the federal government to target“illegal copies of films and other forms of media hosted on foreign servers.” The bill would have hurt Google the most because the search engine would have several results deleted from its database, requiring “ISPs to remove URLs from the Web, which is also known as censorship last time I checked,” Google chairman Eric Schmidt said. Just one month before SOPA was unveiled by Rep. Lamar Smith (R-TX), Schmidt appeared before Congress during a Federal Trade Commission (FTC) hearing where a Republican senator “accused the company of skewing search results to benefit its own products and hurt competitors.” As this hearing took place and Google was grilled by lawmakers, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the Motion Picture Association of America lobbies pushed Congress to pass harsh anti-privacy legislation, accusing companies like Google of giving users access to pirated music and movies. Afraid of the backlash caused by the hearing, Google feared the Hollywood lobby would end up hurting many of its partners, as well as smaller organizations directly tied to Google. But the search engine giant had a way out — its aggressive lobbying and partnership building skills. As SOPA appeared poised for passage, Google and several other tech firms stood in opposition and the bill finally failed. While SOPA was, indeed, a farce — and privacy advocates in Washington were happy the bill didn’t see the light of day — it’s important to note how hard Google worked to keep it from becoming a reality, putting the Silicon Valley giant closer to powerful institutions that, in theory, are against crony capitalism. But after SOPA, the FTC went back to the drawing board, threatening to investigate Google’s alleged antitrust violations further. At the time, the “company’s rivals, including Microsoft and Yelp, were aggressively pressing arguments that Google was exploiting its dominance in the search business.” Reaching out to another partner, George Mason University’s Law & Economics Center, Google and the university put together “the first of three academic conferences at the GMU law school’s Arlington County campus,” which, according to theWashington Post, helped to shape the FTC’s approach to the Google probe from then on. At the third academic conference held at GMU, Google remained present as a silent partner. As “[a] strong contingent of FTC economists and lawyers were on hand for the May 16, 2012, session,” the Washington Post reported, research financially backed by Google was presented by GMU lawyers and economists. And “[i]n January 2013, after an investigation that spanned more than a year and a half, the FTC settled the case with Google, which agreed to give its rivals more access to patents and make it easier for advertisers to use other ad platforms.” From the publication: “But when it came to the charges that Google biased its search results to promote its own products, the five FTC commissioners all voted to close the investigation, saying there was no evidence the company’s practices were harming consumers.” As Google became more involved with politics, other lobbying opportunities would arise. More recently, Google got involved in yet another powerful lobbying effort, which started when the company hired the former administrator of the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to serve as the company’s Director of Safety for Self-Driving Cars, proving the revolving door that presidential candidate Barack Obama promised to nix is still alive and well. The effort paid off, and personal injury attorneys are now concerned that Google may try to push still more regulations, forcing regulators to stick the human driver with the blame for crashes and getting Google’s autonomous driving system off the hook. Whether YouTube’s ad policy has anything to do with its parent company’s politics is impossible to determine. But as we analyze Google’s influence in Washington, it’s important to note that, whether you agree with the tech giant on none, some, or all issues, governments create the incentives for companies like Google to continue rent-seeking. As the economist David R. Henderson puts it, individuals “are said to seek rents when they try to obtain benefits for themselves through the political arena. … licensed electricians and doctors [for instance] often lobby to keep regulations in place that restrict competition from unlicensed electricians or doctors.” Companies like Google are champions of this practice, which has helped to protect the brand’s popularity by keeping competitors at bay. So it’s not a surprise to see many claiming their content is being censored by Google’s YouTube. After all, with the amount of power the company holds in Washington, it’s as if Google — or Alphabet — is an actual wing of the government.

The cow was snapped by Google's cameras at Coe Fen, Cambridge, and seemingly given the same treatment humans receive for privacy reasons. A tweet by The Guardian's David Shariatmadari highlighting the sight was retweeted more than 9,000 times, the BBC reported. Google admitted its face-blurring technology had been "a little overzealous". The cow's face can clearly be seen grazing near the river River Cam on an image taken slightly further away, but Google seems to have blurred it for a close-up view. Google's Street View launched in 2007 and received widespread media coverage as cars mounted with cameras mapped streets around the world. To help combat privacy concerns, software is used to automatically blur human faces. Shariatmadari spotted the bovine anomaly and posted it on Twitter, saying it was "great to see Google takes cow privacy seriously". "Udderly ridiculous," said one user in reply. "Google teat view," said another. It has also been reported by the Cambridge News and national media in Britian. So far the tweet has been liked more than 12,000 times. A spokesman for Google said: "We thought you were pulling the udder one when we herd the moos, but it's clear that our automatic face-blurring technology has been a little overzealous."

We have now finished our apprenticeship, where we have completed three rotations in different service areas offered by Fresh Egg. Read on to discover how we have found our final four months. Monet Final rotation: Biddable media Biddable media was my third and final rotation completing my year’s apprenticeship at Fresh Egg. There is no denying that I have learnt masses from my time in Biddable and it has been the complete opposite to my previous SEO rotation. After submerging myself within revision and taking the Google exams to earn individual certification, I was able to proactively assist the team in the everyday running of PPC campaigns. Using tools such as SEMRush and Google Keyword Planner has allowed me to conduct research before implementing builds in AdWords Editor. Monitoring the accounts to ensure they are not over/under spending is critical, thus I have learnt how to use AdWords data to monitor budget and continually optimise the account, through the use of Search Query Reports. With the support of the team, I quickly grasped all things PPC and I am leaving the department confident in my abilities and with eight more industry qualifications under my belt. I would like to say a huge thank you to all my mentors over the last year! I am unable to put into words how much knowledge and skills I have acquired. My journey with Fresh Egg doesn’t end here however, in October I will be starting an exciting new role within the Marketing and Communications team, as a Marketing Assistant. Charlie Final rotation: Biddable media I started my rotation in Biddable Media on the 15th of May; eager to learn more about arguably the most effective and influential advertising engine the world has ever seen. After immersing ourselves in the AdWords interface and revising Google supplied revision material, the fundamental exams proved no match. In no time we were experiencing the brands that Fresh Egg work with on a regular basis, looking at optimising accounts where we could. Over the period of three and a bit months, and with lots of help from the brilliant Biddable Team, I can happily find my way around otherwise daunting tools, build campaigns and optimise them with a view to increase the visibility of all searches the client desires. I really cannot express in words how thankful I am to all of my mentors over the year (you know who you are!). Not only have you supported my development as a marketer, you've helped me become a better person as well. I look forward to returning to the Tech SEO department this October; the rotation which kicked off this amazing journey. Meg Final rotation: Analytics & insight In May 2016, I began my final rotation in Analytics and Insight. The work I have performed in this department has been completely different to any of the work I have previously completed at Fresh Egg. This has been very useful and has given me a broader knowledge of understanding data and working in Google Analytics. When I first started in this team my main priority was to pass my GAIQ, after a few weeks of solid revision I finally passed and was able to get busy working on client accounts. I have completed a number of tasks within the department; these include insight reports, monthly dashboards, health checks and spot checks. I’ve really enjoyed working within this team as I’ve learnt so much in such a short amount of time. The tasks I found most exciting would be producing health checks, as you can discover a lot about a website and come up with different ways to make improvements. Georgie Final rotation: technical SEO SEO is my final rotation here at Fresh Egg (this year has flown by), and during my time in the team I have had the opportunity to get involved in many hands-on projects, and learn a lot about the department. Starting with the useful, but sometimes tedious, Distilled U modules, I feel I now have the foundations to build on in terms of a working SEO knowledge – I’ve learnt what really goes on behind the scenes of a website that I previously had no idea about. I’ve gained experience in working with SEO specific tools such as Screaming Frog, Ahrefs and Majestic SEO, and now have a clear understanding of what Google looks for in the structural and technical elements of a website. Although each day has been different, there’s always been a tonne to learn. Thank you to everyone who has made my time here at Fresh Egg such a great and rewarding experience. Abbie Final rotation: client services I can’t believe it’s almost over… Client Services has been an amazing experience. Honestly, there has not been a quiet moment, almost to the point that I don’t have time to do my GAIQ but rest assured, I’ll get there. So, what have I been up to? Writing PESTLE analysis Running reports and adding RAGs into Synergist Creating endless Wiki pages Working in collaboration with Lisa on the documenting processes project Creating and formatting endless Trello boards Lots of self-study and exams Competitor research Account time management reporting Changing the passwords (good luck to the poor soul that has to do it when we leave) Creating presentations Listening and taking notes in client calls/meetings I have honestly never met a more supportive bunch than the Client Services team. Despite how nervous I was in doing my first presentation at Fresh Egg, I have never felt more comfortable. They really do get you thinking on your feet, so improvising, handling pressure and keeping calm have never been so important! On that note I want to take this opportunity to thank everyone at Fresh Egg – for all the time and effort you have put into making me a more knowledgeable and confident person (ignoring the fact it took me three months to pluck up the courage to make a cup of tea). You’ve all been invaluable to the rest of my career… thank you very much.

 The head of Google Doodle says he sees 'Google' in everything Avery Hartmans Sep. 16, 2016, 8:45 AM 1,510 facebook linkedin twitter email print Google Doodle team lead Ryan Germick. Google Ryan Germick describes his job as "a blessing and a curse." The head of the Google Doodle team — and arguably the person with the most fun job at Google — said that while he loves his job, the curse is that everything starts to look like a Doodle.  "Like at the supermarket, the cucumbers and tomatoes are arranged a certain way and I’m like, ‘You know what, if I had a watermelon, that could work as a G,'" Germick told Business Insider. " You start to recognize the pattern and you realize that as arbitrary as the constraint is to have to use the world 'Google' in a piece of illustration or design you’re doing, it actually is a constraint that can inspire a lot of creativity. We’re almost 4,000 Doodles in and there’s no end in sight." Germick says he loves all the Doodles like his own children, but he does have some favorites, like a Doodle with musical instruments where you could create a track and share it with your friends, or the Doodle from Halloween 2015 that was its own candy collection game.  'Unbridled creativity and imagination' Germick is passionate about how important creative expression is for children — and for adults.  "My opinion is that everybody can draw, everybody can dance, everybody can sing," he said. "It’s a crime to deny yourself that; it’s a human thing to express yourself. It’s not really about fancy drawing skill or even being a capital A artist." Germick described growing up as " a process of forgetting to be expressive" and Google's goal is to counteract that and encourage people to be creative throughout their lives.  "The kind of unbridled creativity and imagination that young artists…that just pours out of them, is something that we try very hard to replicate in our professional jobs as creative people," he said. " I never think I’ll run out of inspiration from seeing the individual creative expressions that come out of these young artists." How the Doodle team blows off steam So what does the guy with who might have the most fun at Google do to relax? Nerf basketball.  The Doodle team has a Nerf hoop in its office, which has led to some competitive games — and some heightened rivalries.  "I’m a big Golden State Warriors fan and I just got back from vacation and below the Nerf hoop that we have taped to our office wall very cruelly is now a pretty large wall sticker of LeBron James holding the trophy, taunting me," Germick said. "Right now, it’s gotten personal."

Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co (HPE) Stock Is a Long-Term Survivor Is Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) The King of AI After Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) Deal? View All Posts Google of Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) has long dominated online search, indexed million of books, mapped out much of the world and even developed driverless cars. But for all that success, the company just cannot seem to crack social. Source: Open Grid Scheduler Via Flickr Google has a rather long list of social media also-rans, including Orkut, Reader, Wave, and more recently, Buzz, the ill-fated Gmail-based social network that imploded following a catastrophic user policy violation and a class action lawsuit. It’s an open secret that Google’s sole surviving social media platform, Google Plus, has failed to gain any meaningful traction despite the company’s best efforts. Now Google Plus is on life support. GOOGL has continued to diminish attention to the social media platform while simultaneously enhancing services such as YouTube. Last year, Google took the bold step of separating Google Plus profiles from its more popular services, including YouTube. Now Google has announced that Google Plus will stop supporting Hangouts On Air as of Sept. 12 with the broadcast service continuing to exist under YouTube Live. 4 Stocks That Will Accelerate Thanks to Driverless Cars In effect, Google is completely giving up on pitching Google+ as a social media platform. Google Plus Was Doomed to Fail It appears that Google Plus, one of Alphabet’s most epic and expensive failures, was doomed to fail from the get-go. First off, although Google developed the platform in 2010 as a matter of necessity, it did so from a wrong mindset. Google developed Google Plus primarily to serve its need for user data and as a Facebook Inc (NASDAQ:FB) competitor. GOOGL was actually scared that FB was going to eat its lunch and desperately needed to stem the threat. In 2011, Facebook was still a private company valued around $50 billion, much smaller than Google’s own market capitalization of about $200 billion. But Facebook had something Google coveted: a rich cache of data from more than 500 million users. All the while Facebook was busy poaching key Google executives. Alphabet Inc did little to differentiate Google Plus from existing social media sites, and the result was that the platform ended up looking little more than a Facebook clone. The company did outthink Facebook on some aspects, notably Circles, a feature that allows users to better customize the privacy of what they share. But FB was no slouch in the “me-too” game either, and soon introduced a similar feature. In the end, there was little reason for people to switch from FB to Google Plus.

Google Street View is known to blur out faces or number plates to protect privacy but the tech giant took privacy to a whole new level when it obscured the face of a cow in Cambridge in the United Kingdom. The picture of the cow with its face blurred minding its own business on the banks of the River Cam was snapped by Google’s cameras last August. It was highlighted this week by the Guardian’s U.S. Opinion Editor David Shariatmadari. His tweet carrying the picture has been retweeted over 10,000 times and the tweet has received over 13,000 likes so far. The image also drew in a lot of cow jokes. Google Street View’s privacy isn’t absolute when it comes to this cow though. The cow can be viewed in all its glory further down the road but its face was blurred when it came closer to the camera.

Outlook.com now integrates with Google Drive and Facebook photos. Microsoft has long integrated its own OneDrive cloud storage option into Outlook.com and for users who prefer Google Drive this new integration is a big deal. Microsoft notes that its Outlook mobile apps support Box, Dropbox, and Google Drive. Google Drive is now part of the cloud storage capability at Outlook.com and you can now easily share photos to Facebook from Outlook. To add your Google Drive account to Outlook, the user needs to start a new message and then click the attachment icon. Then select Google Drive and enter account credentials. Once you do that Google Drive will appear as a source for attaching files. Users can browse and select files from a list view or as thumbnails. In the past when users opened Google file types, it happened in a new tab. With the update, you will now see Google Doc, Slide, or Sheet within Outlook just as you see photos. The Google files will open next to your message window so you can keep reading the email. Sharing Facebook photos is the same as setting up Google Drive. You click attachment, choose Facebook, and enter credentials. It’s also easier to find attachments in long conversations. At the top of the thread is an attachment icon, clicking it opens a drop-down list of the attachments in the conversation. These new features are available on migrated Outlook.com accounts on the web. The attachment feature is on Office 365 commercial subscriptions and Outlook on the web. The new features are rolling out over the next few weeks so you may not see then on your account just yet.

X Google’s Dublin data centre goes ‘net zero on waste’ Dublin data centre one of six of tech giant’s facilities with no waste going to landfill Fri, Sep 16, 2016, 12:35 Charlie Taylor Google opened its first data centre in Dublin in 2012. A second data centre opened earlier this year.         Google has said its Dublin-based data centre is one of six facilities worldwide that has successfully managed to ensure that none of its waste goes to landfill. The tech giant, which operates 14 data centres globally, said the Dublin facility, along with sites in Finland, Belgium, Taiwan, Singapore and Oklahoma in the United States, has achieved a 100 per cent diversion rate, with no more than 10 per cent of it going to a waste-to-energy site. Globally, the company is currently diverting at least 86 per cent of waste away from landfills, it said. Zero waste to landfill Google said it was working towards “zero waste to landfill” at all its facilities, and was also seeking to reduce the amount of waste it produces. “Zero waste to landfill is just the first step in a long process to sustainably manage our resources throughout the entire life cycle of our data centres,” it said. Google opened its first data centre in Dublin in 2012. A second data centre opened earlier this year as part of a €150 million investment.       Topics: Dublin(IE) Subscribe.   More from The Irish Times Technology Facebook finds three errors in calculating advert effectiveness Personal Finance The bond rout and Irish pension savers: what you need to be aware of Gaelic Games Ciarán Murphy: Castleknock GAA club prove that sometimes less is more Business Qualtrics in Ireland: ‘Our granny made us come here’ Sponsored HR managers need a simplified approach to pensions World-first tech restores mains electricity to Aran Islands Newbridge Silverware builds ambitious plan for US market My Jaguar F-Pace: ‘I was completely blown away’ ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT Latest Business Most European indices decline led by falls for banking stocks 19:55 Car finance firm raises €25m for lending 18:43 MetLife to create more than 200 jobs at Galway campus 18:37 Facebook finds three errors in calculating advert effectiveness 18:25 Dunbia sells pork processing business to Cranswick 17:59 ADVERTISEMENT Tech Tools Could sleep problems be a thing of the past with Sense?

Cow captured on Street View refuses to moo-ve out of the picture Google Street View seems to have taken its privacy policy to the next level after an image of a cow with its features blurred emerged. The image was taken last summer in Cambridge, England, and was discovered by The Guardian’s David Shariatmadari, who highlighted it in a tweet that has been retweeted over 9,000 times. Google Street View launched in 2007 to provide photographic views of streets and countryside all over the world. Google automatically blurs faces and car licence plates to protect privacy but doesn’t normally protect the anonymity of animals. This case has attracted plenty of attention and jokes and terrible puns on social media. A spokesperson for Google told the BBC: “We thought you were pulling the udder one when we herd the moos, but it’s clear that our automatic face-blurring technology has been a little overzealous. Of course, we don’t begrudge this cow milking its five minutes of fame.” @D_Shariatmadari @jonworth Some people think one cow looks much like any udder.

Photo credit: @D_Shariatmadari The Guardian’s David Shariatmadari tweeted an image highlighting the cow with blurred face. London, Sep 16:   A cow that had its face blurred by Google Street View has gone viral on social media, prompting the Internet giant to say its face-blurring technology had been “a little overzealous”. The cow was snapped by Google’s cameras at Coe Fen, Cambridge, and seemingly given the same treatment humans receive for privacy reasons. A tweet by The Guardian’s David Shariatmadari highlighting the sight was retweeted more than 9,000 times, the BBC reported. Great to see Google takes cow privacy seriously pic.twitter.com/ACTBpDwno6— David Shariatmadari (@D_Shariatmadari) September 13, 2016 Google admitted its face-blurring technology had been “a little overzealous”. The cow’s face can clearly be seen grazing near the river River Cam on an image taken slightly further away, but Google seems to have blurred it for a close-up view. Google’s Street View launched in 2007 and received widespread media coverage as cars mounted with cameras mapped streets around the world. To help combat privacy concerns, software is used to automatically blur human faces. Shariatmadari spotted the bovine anomaly and posted it on Twitter, saying it was “great to see Google takes cow privacy seriously”. “Udderly ridiculous,” said one user in reply. “Google teat view,” said another. It has also been reported by the Cambridge News and national media in Britian. So far the tweet has been liked more than 12,000 times. A spokesman for Google said, “We thought you were pulling the udder one when we herd the moos, but it’s clear that our automatic face-blurring technology has been a little overzealous.” “Of course, we don’t begrudge this cow milking its five minutes of fame,” the spokesman added.

Home FEATURED Cellphones Notebooks Gaming Tablets Software Chrome for Android Soon to Have Support for Background Media Playback September 16, 2016, By Sanjeev Ramachandran Share This Related Posts WhatsApp is Finally Offering Added Security via Two-Factor Authentication Bezel-less Screen to Remote Wireless Charging; Apple’s Ground Breaking Technologies for iPhone 8 Thanks to Google’s focus on Windows platform, we finally have the materialistic design standards capsuled in the Windows web version. This came as a part of Google’s extra input on tweaking the Chrome OS and Chrome Windows with version 53 update. But that’s past, as Google is now putting their attention back to rejig Chrome for Android with version 54. As a result, a number of new media-related overhauls are being lined up by the company for its mobile browser, all of which has now been made available in the Chrome for Beta for Android devices. The major revamp is the support for media playback in the background. Users will now be able to listen to audio of media streams in background, which includes instances like switching tabs or when jumping to home screen. Videos will get paused once the aforesaid actions are done, but it will still keep the playback controls alive on the notification bar and users can have the playback resumed from there. Almost all the streaming sites will be compatible with the new background playback, including YouTube. Apart from this, Chrome for Android is also adding support for video orientation, which will now enable direct entry to full screen mode for videos when the device gets rotated. Google is also bringing playback alterations to the desktop version, with embedded YouTube Flash players in the websites being now reworked to adopt the embed style used by HTML5. Besides the new media reshuffles, Chrome for Android will also introduce a new ‘New Tab’ page that will now present suggested articles from Google Now. Other changes made available in the beta version are support for creation of custom elements, support for V1 spec, a new BroadcastChannel API etc. The update will be coming for the stable version by the end of October.

Comments Greenbot | Sep 16, 2016 4:00 AM PT RELATED TOPICS Android Apps Games Comments When you think of Queen’s iconic “Bohemian Rhapsody,” what pops to mind? Wayne’s World? Maybe next time your brain will go to vivid virtual reality, as Google just released the mesmerizing Bohemian Rhapsody Experience app for Cardboard VR. It leads our latest batch of new Android app and game recommendations, all of which are focused on fun and entertainment. Also new this week is Fox’s Animation Throwdown, which blends several popular cartoon universes for a card-battling game, along with teen-focused live-streaming app, Live.ly. Six! and MyNBA2K17 round out this week’s pack, so if you want to shake up your phone’s app selection with some new options, here’s a good place to start. The Bohemian Rhapsody Experience The Experience gradually transforms and shifts between various scenes and styles. Much like the song itself! “Bohemian Rhapsody” is one of the most instantly recognizable rock songs in history, and now it’s one of the most memorable VR apps for Cardboard. Queen’s classic is the focus of Google’s new app, which concocts a dazzling dream world around the six-minute track. You’ll see odd cartoon creatures, bits of archival video footage, animated versions of the band members, and even dancers and other elements that react based on how you look around. As a 360-degree experience with spatial sound, The Bohemian Rhapsody Experience is best experienced in a Cardboard viewer—but even if you don’t have one of the low-end VR shells, you can still watch the whole thing in full-screen on your device. It’s short and sweet, but as a free showcase for Cardboard and a tribute to an amazing song, it’s well worth checking out.  Animation Throwdown Why are Bob and Bender fighting? No clue, but it’s pretty amusing. Card-based games seem to be all the rage right now in mobile, with Final Fantasy and The Wizard of Oz doing it in recent weeks (among others), but this is a curious one: Animation Throwdown mashes up the universes of Fox’s various adult-focused cartoons for a card-battler. You’ll find cards, characters, and backdrops inspired by Family Guy, Bob’s Burgers, Futurama, King of the Hill, and American Dad within, but sadly nothing from The Simpsons. It doesn’t seem like the most obvious fit for a card combat experience, but from what I’ve played, Animation Throwdown seems solidly fun. The cards dig deep into each show’s catalog for amusing jokes, plus you can stack certain cards for special abilities and permanently fuse cards together to improve your deck between battles. With hundreds of cards, a 25-chapter campaign, and online multiplayer battles, this could be a surprisingly deep time sink. Six! No, this isn’t a Tetris clone, but it is pretty darn fun. Great arcade-style games can be learned within seconds but played (and enjoyed) endlessly, and that seems to be the case with Six! Hailing from Gram Games, which made the popular 1010! and Merged!, it’s a game about gradually clearing away Tetris-like blocks from the screen… all while ensuring that the hexagon sitting atop the heap doesn’t fall to either side. As you create openings below, the hexagon shifts and rolls up top, and any attempt to take things slowly and methodically will be thrown out the window as you frantically try to change its trajectory. Six! is simple yet clever, and quite a bit of fun, plus the free download doesn’t have any limits. However, it does have ad banners and occasional video ads, too. Paying $4 within clears them for good, in case you get sucked in deep. Live.ly I sure hope the teens like watching my cat being annoyed. Have you heard of Musical.ly? It’s a make-your-own-music-video lipsyncing app like the recent Funimate, and it’s hugely popular with teens, racking up more than 100 million downloads across platforms. And that same crowd will surely snap up the company’s latest addition, Live.ly, which already topped the charts over on iOS. Anyone already familiar with live-streaming apps like Periscope or Meerkat will feel right at home. That’s because it’s more or less a teen-centric clone, offering the same kind of interface (with chat and streams of emotes) albeit with a more focused target audience. When I checked it out, the top streams included a girl broadcasting from her desk at school, and some kid’s dog chewing a water bottle—about as riveting as the average fare from other live-streaming apps, really. But the ties into the Musical.ly community may give this an edge with the younger crowd. MyNBA2K17 Yes, those are basketball cards playing basketball. NBA 2K17 tips off on consoles today, and 2K Sports’ annual basketball sim just seems to get better every year. We’ll probably get an Android version of the full game at some point, as we did with NBA 2K16 ($8)—but for now, hoops fans can check out MyNBA2K17. Like last year’s game, it’s an odd little amalgamation of basketball and a collectible card game (like Animation Throwdown above), as 2K has also done with WWE SuperCard and NHL SuperCard. You’ll bring a small deck onto the court in the brief battles, picking your best card for each matchup and trying to beat the opposing team. All the while, the cards dribble and shoot the ball, which is as surreal as it is totally hilarious. MyNBA2K17 also serves as a companion app for the main game, letting you earn in-game currency and scan your face to create custom athletes in the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions.

The technology, which is being provided free online so members of the public can monitor the oceans for activity, is aimed at combating overfishing around the world. Fish stocks in many parts of the world are perilously low after being over exploited and despite international agreements on what can be caught, many are still overfished illegally. Scroll down for video  Google has teamed up with two conservation groups and actor Leonardo DiCaprio to create technology that allows the public to monitor the activity of commercial fishing vessels around the world (pictured). It uses satellite, radar and transponder data HOW THE TRACKER WORKS  Currently, Global Fishing Watch does not include every vessel on the ocean, only those that broadcast data from the Automatic Identification System, collected by satellite and terrestrial receivers. It was initially designed mainly as a safety mechanism to avoid collisions. Many of the world's largest fishing vessels are required by the International Maritime Organization to use AIS. But AIS can be turned off if the boat operator is doing something illegal. However, such on-off actions would likely be apparent by tracing the boat's appearing and disappearing tracks. This can help to highlight illegal activity. Future versions of the technology may even include tagging data for marine animals, so that the paths of whales and sharks and other fish might be visible alongside the vessel activity. This could help to reveal if vessels are targetting vulnerable stocks. The technology, called Global Fishing Watch, is designed to provide an eye in the sky that constantly searches for this activity. By providing the information free online, marine conservation campaigners hope citizens will be able to play their part in looking for illegal activity. 'This unprecedented technology is available to everyone in the world,' DiCaprio said at the launch of the software at the US State Department in Washington. 'This platform will empower citizens across the globe to become powerful advocates for our oceans.' Around two thirds of global fish stocks are overexploited or depleted according to the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation. Illegal fishing is estimated to account for 35 per cent of the global wild marine catch and causes yearly losses of £17.7 billion ($23.5 billion). Some of the planet's largest fish, including tuna and swordfish, now have populations that are below 10 per cent of their historical level. Using satellite technology combined with radar aboard boats, the new platform allows people to trace the paths of 35,000 commercial fishing vessels in almost real time.

Share this article Share 242 shares Actor Leonardo DiCaprio (right), who is a strong campaigner for the environment, unveiled the new project at the US State Department along with US Secretary of State John Kerry (left) Dedicated: The actor at the announcement By focusing on areas of interest they should also be able to spot vessels operating there illegally. The $10 million project has been set up by three partner groups – Google, environmental imaging non-profit SkyTruth and marine conservation group Oceana. Actor DiCaprio has long been a campaigner for the environment and last week premiered a new documentary about climate change. His Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation is one of the main financial backers of the Global Fishing Watch project, after it put in £4.54 million ($6 million). The system allows information like protected marine areas, territorial waters and the country that vessels are from to be visualised (pictured). In the example above the Spanish fleet is in blue, the Japanese in green and the Korean in red The technology uses the Automatic Identification System carried by large fishing vessels to track their location (illustrated). This means suspicious activity can be carefully monitored. In the past it was rarely noticed if these were turned off but the new project will highlight this Since 1999 his foundation has channelled £45 million ($59.6 million) into projects to protect vulnerable wildlife and ecosystems. Global Fishing Watch is being an attempt to crowdsource the fight against illegal fishing. Jacqueline Savitz, vice president for US oceans at Oceana, said the platform will 'revolutionise the way the world views commercial fishing.' She said it could provide vital data for governments to monitor and enforce fishing restrictions, for journalists investigating suspicious activity and for the public to help track illegal activity. However, the data will be provided by satellite company Orbcomm with a three day delay, meaning it will not be possible to use it to instantly catch any criminals. The technology can reveal that vessels from all around the world can cluster in fishing areas, such as around South Georgia Island in the example pictured  The online software also highlights protected marine areas (shown in green above) and highlights when vessels are operating within their borders 'We think it is going to have a lot of impact, first of all just the deterrent effect of vessels knowing that we could see them if they are doing something they are not supposed to be doing,' Ms Savitz said. For instance, users could zero in on a marine protected area and see if any boat tracks have crossed into waters where they should not have been. One could scan the map for any evidence that large vessels are fishing in areas that are reserved for small-scale fishermen. Overfishing is a growing problem around the world, with about two-thirds of fish stocks in the high seas either over exploited or depleted (stock image) Vessels can be tracked by name or by country, or by traffic inside exclusive economic zones. The paths of ships are visible, including zigzag paths that could indicate vessels are avoiding shore to offload their catch on to other ships undetected, or that other illegal operations or human rights abuses may be under way. Already, the government of Kiribati has used Global Fishing Watch data to unmask illegal fishing in the Phoenix Islands Protected Area, declared off-limits to commercial fishing on January 1, 2015.

However, it has absolutely huge potential to finally bring VR to the masses. Welcome Home: Google's $130 smart speaker Google's smart Home speaker still has a lot of learning to do, and loses out to Amazon's Echo in some areas - but has incredible potential 'Not quite an iPhone replacement': Google's Pixel phone Google's Pixel handset is good, and boasts an amazing camera and smart assistant. It's the king of the Android handsets - but still not great. Xbox One S review: Console that will make your 4K TV shine Microsoft's Xbox One S has shrunk the giant console by 40%, and is stunningly designed console with 4K HDR capabilities - but comes with some caveats. The $1,000 wireless speaker that really IS worth the price: Naim Mu-so Qb review Naim's incredible Mu-So Qb takes you back to the good old days - where the music captivates and enthralls, rather that simply being something in the background. The hi-tech $2,000 spin bike that really could change your life Peloton's hi-tech bike lets you stream live and on demand rides to your home - and it's one of the best examples of fitness technology out there - at a price. Apple's new 9.7inch iPad Pro is a powerhouse you can take anywhere Apple has added a few improvements to the smaller version, creating a tablet that is astonishingly powerful, but, unlike its big brother, is something you'll be able to carry everywhere. A familiar old friend that could be the perfect starter phone: Dailymail.com's verdict on the iPhone SE The new iPhone SE has a 4inch screen and familiar design - but has had a huge upgrade on the inside, making this a perfect first time iPhone. Speaker that looks as good as its sounds: B&W Zeppelin Wireless review It's not cheap, but the $699 (£500) Zeppelin Wireless is perfect for the design conscious music fan. The iPad grows up: Apple's iPad Pro The iPad Pro is, for many, a real laptop replacement - and a way to combine work and play in a gadget that will last all day and won't break your back to carry. 'A glimpse into the future of the living room': The new Apple TV Apple says apps are the future of TV, and while its new $149 box does have some issues, its combination of streaming services, games and other apps make it the best way to make your TV smart. The end of wonky wifi: Google's OnHub It's incredibly simple to set up, and we found it tripled the speed of our home wifi connection - but at $199 is expensive.. The best all in one wireless speaker you'll ever hear: Naim Mu-so review It might not be a name familiar to the US market, but Naim is a legendary British brand hoping to make a splash with the American launch of its $1499 Mu:So speaker.

Panoramics Photos Rec.humor.funny Joke Site Robocar Bog Twitter Best of Blog Brad's Home Robocars.com Home » Topic » Robocars Uber buys Otto, folks leave Google, Ford goes big, Tesla dumps MobilEye Submitted by brad on Thu, 2016-08-18 15:18. Robocars The past period has seen some very big robocar news. Real news, not the constant “X is partnering with Y” press releases that fill the airwaves some times. Uber has made a deal to purchase Otto, a self-driving truck company I wrote about earlier founded by several friends of mine from Google. The rumoured terms of the deal as astronomical — possibly 1% of Uber’s highly valued stock (which means almost $700M) and other performance rewards. I have no other information yet on the terms, but it’s safe to say Otto was just getting started with ambitious goals and would not have sold for less than an impressive amount. For a company only 6 months old, the rumoured terms surpass even the amazing valuation stories of Cruise and Zoox. While Otto has been working on self-driving technology for trucks, any such technology can also move into cars. Uber already has an active lab in Pittsburgh, but up to now has not been involved in long haul trucking. (It does do local deliveries in some places.) There are many startups out there calling themselves the “Uber for Trucks” and Otto has revealed it was also working on shipping management platform tools, so this will strike some fear into those startups. Because of my friendship with Otto’s team, I will do more commentary when more details become public. In other Uber news, Uber has announced it will sell randomly assigned Uber rides in their self-driving vehicles in Pittsburgh. If your ride request is picked at random (and because it’s in the right place) Uber will send one of their own cars to drive you on your ride, and will make the ride free, to boot. Of course, there will be an Uber safety driver in the vehicle monitoring it and ready to take over in any problem or complex situation. So the rides are a gimmick to some extent, but if they were not free, it would be a sign of another way to get customers to pay for the cost of testing and verifying self-driving cars. The free rides, however, will probably actually cause more people to take Uber rides hoping they will win the lottery and get not simply the free ride but the self-driving ride. GM announced a similar program for Lyft — but not until next year. Ford also goes all-in, but with a later date Ford has announced it wants to commit to making unmanned capable taxi vehicles, the same thing Uber, Google, Cruise/GM, Zoox and most non-car companies want to make. For many years I have outlined the difference between the usual car company approaches, which are evolutionary and involve taking cars and improving their computers and the approaches of the non-car companies which bypass all legacy thinking (mostly around ADAS) to go directly to the final target. I call that “taking a computer and putting wheels on it.” It’s a big and bold move for Ford to switch to the other camp, and a good sign for them. They have said they will have a fleet of such vehicles as soon as 2021. Other companies have announced plans to go for unmanned capable taxi vehicles, particularly Daimler and BMW, but they still maintain active “evolutionary” projects which hope to build on their prior ADAS work. Velodyne The other big news is that Ford, together with Baidu have made a $150M investment in Velodyne. Velodyne has been for a decade the primary supplier of LIDARs for robocar research projects, but their LIDARs are research instruments, high performance at high cost. In the meantime, other companies (such as Quanergy, for whom I am an advisor) have been pushing to make better priced LIDARs for real production. The Velodynes have been the right choice, because it is smart to research with what’s expensive today, knowing it will get cheap in the future. Baidu’s test cars have had Velodynes on them, but there were recent rumours of Baidu experimenting with alternatives to LIDAR, but this investment may counter those rumours. This investment will move Velodyne more to a lower cost production unit, though at present at a higher cost than the solid-state plans of Quanergy and some others. Google Departures Otto included a few people from Google’s car team. It was also recently revealed that Chris Urmson, who had run the team for most of its existence and was moved to “CTO” after the arrival of John Krafcik, has departed. I worked for Chris but he has not told me his reason for departure. In general, Google’s car team has gotten huge, and the recently departed people are mostly folks who were among the first 20 on the team. This may simply be a sign of massive expansion, I have not heard much to credit the idea that there is some sort of internal chaos. In addition, deals like the Otto deal will certainly cause people to consider if they want to work for a big corporation or break out on their own. MobilEye A few weeks ago, MobilEye issued a press release that they would not be supplying the next generation of their EyeQ chips to Tesla. The EyeQ4 is a great deal more sophisticated than the EyeQ3 that Telsa uses, and Tesla even uses an older version with a more limited set of features — including, most famously, the inability to detect things like cross traffic. Since MobilEye announced it, it seems like it was their decision (You don’t usually issue a press release to say you have been dumped by a smaller customer.) It caused their stock to take a quick big hit (Disclaimer, I own a small amount) on the day of the announcement, but it recovered reasonably well. Tesla’s stock was not affected. Tesla folks have always claimed that they only made minimal use of ME’s functionality, and that the real special sauce was theirs. ME folks have claimed the opposite. This break-up will settle that question, and presumably Tesla has been working on alternatives for a while as they don’t seem to be in much panic about it. Tesla has made announcements of plans for their new hardware and those plans look very similar to the EyeQ4, so they must have had their own parallel research underway. » brad's blog Question Submitted by Bill D (not verified) on Thu, 2016-08-18 16:41. Brad, Any thoughts about the MIT / DARPA announcement they might be able to design lidars on a chip to be priced at around $10 each Does that seem feasible to you? Significant? http://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-talk/semiconductors/optoelectronics/mit-li... » reply Solid state Submitted by brad on Fri, 2016-08-19 00:24. This project is attempting to do a solid state LIDAR, which is also the goal of Quanergy. Quanergy is much further along, and others hope to do the same thing. The $10 price point is when you are making many millions of the chip, and yes, anything that can go on one chip in those quantities can get a cost that low, though usually you add a few other things beyond the chip. Whether it is this, or Quanergy, or other companies working on it, low cost LIDAR is definitely coming, and will be used on all robocars, I predict, even Tesla (though Elon has sworn otherwise.) Or at least it will until there is some remarkable breakthrough in computer vision. Which is not impossible, but not here yet. I expect the cheap lidars are sooner. But if you have cheap lidar and cheap camera you use both, of course, at least for the first decade. » reply Current cost of lidar Submitted by Bo Nordlin (not verified) on Fri, 2016-08-19 03:13. Brad, I highly appreciate your writing. What are the current cost of lidars in an autonomous vehicle, and what has been the typical yearly price reduction so far? » reply Current cost Submitted by brad on Sun, 2016-08-21 18:09. There is no standard LIDAR. Velodyne makes several products ranging from $8,000 to $75,000. Valeo sells a simple 4 plane designed by Ibeo for $250 but it’s not really suitable for self-driving. Quanergy has a $1,000 8 laser unit being tested by some automakers. There are a few other research ones out there. Many companies have this in development, they only just figured it out a while ago. It is reasonable to expect that suitable LIDARs will be under $250, perhaps far under, but you may need more than one. » reply Quanergy et al chip based LiDAR RANGE Submitted by Rutt Bridges (not verified) on Sun, 2016-08-21 18:59. Brad, While I have seen multiple stories about chip-based LiDAR (mostly re: Quanergy), the one thing I haven't see is a spec on range. While the cost-effectiveness of these units could be a real breakthrough for driverless vehicles, if the range is under 100 feet their application will be quite limited. Have you seen or heard any quotes on range? » reply Range Submitted by brad on Mon, 2016-08-22 03:25. Range for LIDARs is more a function of their light frequency and eye safety rules. You can’t emit so much power that it would be dangerous to the eye. At that maximum power, you can go about 100m on a dark object and still be seen coming back (against the sun.) You can go further on brighter objects, and most objects are brighter, but you have to focus on that minimum range. » reply More sensitive lidar Submitted by Anonymous (not verified) on Fri, 2016-10-28 16:33.

Apple just bought Turi (nee Dato, nee GraphLab). In doing so they acquired the GraphLab Create and Turi Distributed platforms, nice toolkits that accelerate common Machine Learning tasks. However, those don't seem to fit with Apple's product portfolio at all. However they also acquired 50+ data scientists, most with PhDs. To me it looks like perhaps it's an acqui-hire, so they can use those resources on their internal ML projects (cough-self-driving-car-cough). Disclaimer: I'm an evangelist for Turi (i.e. a run a users' group for them, for which I get no cash compensation but do get the occasional perk like a conference ticket). However, I have no special knowledge about their business internals and this is speculation on my part. » reply Tesla & maps Submitted by Anonymous (not verified) on Sat, 2016-08-20 11:22.

Hi Brad Given the pace at which taxi firms are trying to develop autonomous cars and autonomous car developers are increasingly foreseeing a car-on-demand model for the SDC operations, it remains to be seen how car owners/operators will prevent people from misusing the cars - Misusing meaning everything from pure vandalism and dirtying the car to outright car jacking/ using as a self-guided ballistic missile? Would you know if these firms have something in mind to prevent such incidents? » reply Rental cars Submitted by brad on Mon, 2016-09-12 11:12. Are these issues different from the issues with rental cars (Hertz) or carshare (Zipcar)? If they don’t have a wheel, you can’t use them as a missile (unless you physically alter the car, which again you can do with any rental car.) » reply You are right! Autonomous Submitted by Bejoy John (not verified) on Fri, 2016-09-16 02:45. You are right! Autonomous cars as missiles seem to be less of a threat. But when it comes to rental cars or car share, at the end of the day, the guy who takes it out has to face the owner of the car when handing it back. That leaves them kind of "obliged" to take care of the car in their custody, which is what prevents people from vandalizing the vehicle. Even a contract to take care of the car is useless if the car owner isn't around to track vandalism and take defaulters to task. Compare that to public toilets where no one is watching you use it and you don't have to face the owner(the govt., public utility cos). So people do not care so much and just use and leave it as they feel. Even facing another user doesn't seem to have the same effect as facing the owner. I see an analog in current business models of autonomous cars - nobody is watching you use it and the car just goes to the next guy who wants to use it. That made me wonder if such consumer behavior is already factored in (but maybe not announced) by autonomous car companies or is it that measures to counter such behavior need to be developed. » reply I have a number of articles on this topic Submitted by brad on Fri, 2016-09-16 10:36. Mostly related to the privacy problems because taxi owners will indeed want cameras to stop damage (mostly accidental) to cars as well as people leaving their stuff in them. My current model is as you leave (to stop the meter running) you flip the lever on the camera’s cover, it takes a photo after you are out, and compares it to the photo before you got in, and if there’s a difference, it is examined. In most cases it’s, “You left your bag in the car” but sometimes it’s “You spilled your drink or puked” and the car goes to the car wash and you get the bill. » reply Comment viewing options Flat list - collapsedFlat list - expandedThreaded list - collapsedThreaded list - expanded Date - newest firstDate - oldest first 10 comments per page30 comments per page50 comments per page70 comments per page90 comments per page150 comments per page200 comments per page250 comments per page300 comments per page Select your preferred way to display the comments and click "Save settings" to activate your changes.

By Nick Heath | September 16, 2016, 2:15 AM PST RSS Comments Facebook Linkedin Twitter More Email Print Reddit Delicious Digg Pinterest Stumbleupon Google Plus A close up of one of D-Wave's quantum processors. Image: Google / YouTube We may be decades from unlocking the true power of quantum computing, but D-Wave is promising to offer a taste of the future with its significantly upgraded quantum processor. When it is released early next year, the Canadian firm's new quantum chip will be able to handle some 2,000 quantum bits (qubits), roughly double the usable number found in the processor in the existing D-Wave 2X system, and be capable of solving certain problems 1,000x faster than its predecessor. D-Wave machines are multi-million dollar computers that crunch data using "quantum transistors", tiny loops of niobium cooled to close to absolute zero by liquid helium. Only a handful of such systems are in use, run by Google and the Universities Space Research Association, Lockheed Martin and Los Alamos National Laboratory. However, D-Wave also offers access to its quantum computers via a cloud service. SEE: Quantum computing: The smart person's guide Quantum computing is still a largely theoretical field, which studies how to exploit the bizarre and counter-intuitive way that matter behaves at an atomic level to develop hugely powerful machines. For certain tasks, quantum computers have the potential to be exponentially faster than existing systems, as well as being vastly more energy efficient. While a universal quantum computer doesn't yet exist, the D-Wave system utilises various atomic behaviors, such as entanglement and state superposition, to help solve a range of difficult computational problems.

"We've been on a trajectory, which has been doubling the number of qubits pretty much every year," said Colin Williams, director of business development and strategic partnerships at D-Wave. Bumping up the qubits on the D-Wave processor moves the systems closer to being able to challenge conventional computers, and the new processor will also support additional features that allow for more efficient calculations. "From an internal tests, that looks like that's a really good thing to do. We've got some problems we've already sped up by a factor of 1,000 by exploiting that capability," said Williams at the CW TEC conference in Cambridge. D-Wave systems are not universal computers, as is the case with PCs today. Rather than being capable of performing any computational task asked of them, D-Wave machines are designed to tackle a specific task known as unconstrained binary optimization, as well as related sampling problems. A very simple example of this type of optimization problem might be the challenge of drawing up a plan for a house that comes as close to your dream spec as possible, while staying within your budget. The specialized work that the D-Wave processor can carry out could be useful in a number of areas, according to D-Wave, particularly training machine learning models. However, there are still significant obstacles to the larger challenge of building a universal quantum computer, with several unresolved engineering challenges. By extrapolating from past trends in chip development, John Morton, professor of nanoelectronics and nanophotonics at UCL, predicts the first universal quantum processor won't be built until the 2030s. Morton said that just as a calculator isn't a computer, so the D-Wave system isn't a universal quantum computer. "A calculator solves a very specific set of problems. Lots of people use it, and you can use calculators across many different industries," he said. "So when D-Wave shows you many different industries that might use a D-Wave machine, there may be many areas that it can be used in, but it remains a specialized device." While Google isn't using the D-Wave machine to bolster its machine-learning efforts as of yet, the credibility of D-Wave's processors — which has been repeatedly challenged by some academics — was given a boost by a test run by the technology giant late last year. The experiment found that the D-Wave 2X processor was 100 million times faster than a classical processor running a similar operation, but more importantly it demonstrated the future viability of D-Wave's chips, according to Williams. "The main takeaway from that wasn't really a speed up result, because there are other classical algorithms that can do better," he said. "That experiment showed the quantum tunnelling really was occurring in the D-Wave chip. It showed that even if the range of that tunnelling is finite, it is a useful computational tool. "Google understood, as do we, that as we evolve the design of our chip to make it more densely connected, then the classical algorithms that currently work well for this problem will completely fall apart." D-Wave has raised millions of dollars in funding from various investors, including investment bank Goldman Sachs, In-Q-Tel (the investment arm of the US Central Intelligence Agency), Bezos Expeditions (the investment arm of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos), and BDC Capital, Harris & Harris Group, and DFJ. A machine that can speak like a human Another criticism of the D-Wave's chip is that its specialized nature limits its usefulness, something that Williams rejects. "I wanted to put to rest the idea that the D-Wave chip only does one thing, it's actually been shown that the one thing it does, can be used in lots of different fields," he said. While not naming the organizations that had used D-Wave chips in this way, he said the processors had been used in the financial sector for trading trajectory optimization, to work out how proteins fold in bioscience, to create filters for lists that never miss a potential match — useful for security services checking terrorist watchlists, for development of binary classifiers in AI and for computer vision. But it is unsupervised machine learning, where training data is fed into a neural network and the machine learns by identifying patterns, where Williams believes the D-Wave processor will make the greatest impact, perhaps explaining Google's interest in the technology. "We think that machine learning and AI are fundamentally the best use cases for this kind of machine. It has the potential to be completely revolutionary, especially for unsupervised generative learning," he said. "With the quantum chip, we have the potential to go back and address the original, grand challenging problem of machine learning - 'How do you get unsupervised, generative machine learning to work as efficiently as you can?'. "If you can do that, you can do amazing things with machine learning. You can make a machine that, having trained it, you can make it generate new data that is statistically indistinguishable from the kind of data on which it was trained." Williams predicted future generations of D-Wave chips that could train machines to produce new and convincing works of art in the style of the master painter whose work it was trained on or to be capable of human-like speech, he said. D-Wave has already experimented with machine learning on the chip, setting up a Boltzmann machine, a type of stochastic recurrent neural network, as well as a "Quantum Boltzmann machine", which Williams said is 'fundamentally different from previous machine learning models'. Williams doesn't see the D-Wave chip, or other quantum processors, that might follow as replacing classical computer chips, but as working alongside them. "We recognise that it's not going to be the case that quantum computing replaces classical machines. The way quantum computing is going to change the world is it's going to augment classical systems," he said. "For example, you could take the output of a quantum computer and use that as an input to a heuristic search algorithm. The idea is that the quantum algorithm could get you in the vicinity of a good solution and a classical algorithm could finish it off. "We can also look at pre-processing techniques, to take a problem that is too big, put it on the quantum chip and break it down into a sequence of problems." Beyond the 2000 qubit processor, Williams says that D-Wave has a design for a "next-generation chip" with a "fundamentally new topology, based on all the lessons we've learnt". More details on the new D-Wave chip (for those with a grasp of quantum physics) For those interested in the nitty gritty, Williams spoke in more depth about the new capabilities in its 2,000 qubit chip. Each D-Wave processor is designed for quantum annealing, using quantum physics to find a minimum energy state, which is useful in solving the optimization and related sampling problems mentioned above. Williams explained how the new chip will offer greater control of the annealing process. "It's not just more qubits, we've changed a lot of other features too. On the previous D-Wave chips we only had the ability to look at one annealing trajectory. We've only been able to essentially turn off the initial Hamiltonian and turn on the final Hamiltonian one way," he said, referencing a Hamiltonian formula that is able to output the energy within a system when given the state of that system. "That's no longer true, with the 2,000 qubit chip, we're going to have a lot more control over parameters, we're going to have a lot more control over the trajectory. "From internal tests, that looks like that's a really good thing to do. We've got some problems we've already sped up by a factor of 1,000 by exploiting that capability. "We also have features for pausing the anneal and then ramping it quickly to the end, you don't have to anneal at a constant speed anymore. "That's very interesting, because it allows you to probe the quantum state in the middle of the anneal, which is a critical feature from the point of Quantum Boltzmann Machines. "We also have a faster annealing, previous generations of systems could only anneal down to 20 microseconds. With the new system we can anneal down to five microseconds."

The Google Street View's face-blurring typically blurs license plates and human faces, but it was an editor for the Guardian that recently discovered it also respects the privacy of cows. A black cow near the River Cam at Coe Fen in Cambridge was afforded a moment of privacy that it didn't have seconds earlier in a photos taken from farther away. "We thought you were pulling the udder one when we herd the moos, but it's clear that our automatic face-blurring technology has been a little overzealous," a Google spokesperson said in a statement.
