Tue, 08/16/2016 - 09:45 Google Launches 'Duo', A New Facetime Video Chat Rival Google promised Android 7.0 Nougat would be released during the summer, and a recent leak indicates the new operating system will be available starting Aug. 22. On Friday, tech blog Mobilesyrup shared a leaked document indicating the Canadian carrier Telus will begin rolling out Android Nougat to various smartphones on Monday. Devices include the Nexus 6P, Nexus 5X and Blackberry Priv. Typically, Google’s most recent Nexus smartphones are the first to receive new Android updates, so the leak seems valid in that sense. Google revealed the name of its coming OS, previously referred to as Android N, in late June. The tech giant unveiled a Nougat themed lawn statue following a contest where fans voted for the Android N name. Since then, release details for the software have been scarce, outside of developer preview software releases. The final developer’s preview for Android N hit Nexus devices July 18, so enthusiasts are certain the official release is coming soon. However, Google has yet to comment on rollout plans. The 2016 Nexus smartphones accompanying Android Nougat are also expected to debut soon. Rumors indicate HTC will manufacture both a high-end phablet and mid-range slate smartphone for Google. Leaks suggest at least one of the devices may resemble the HTC 10. There is no word on when the smartphones, codenamed Marlin and Sailfish , will be available. However, we can be certain that it won’t be until after Sept. 6, when LG plans to launch the LG V20 . T h e c o m p a n y is already marketing the device as the first smartphone to run Android 7.0 Nougat. This means the LG V20 will be announced, and possibly also released for purchase, before Google’s Nexus devices.

In fact, Google’s move beyond organic growth suggests that the race may be ramping up a notch, particularly when the other competitors in the market include Comcast, AT&T, and a larger Charter Communications. A larger question remains. Will consumers continue to demand, and be willing to pay for, ever faster broadband speeds? Consumer Perception of Current Broadband Speeds One of the challenges in selling faster broadband services is consumers don’t necessarily know what “faster” really means. Historically, most consumers have little idea what broadband speed they have in their home, much less how much speed that they actually need. In recent Parks Associates survey results, 43% of U.S. broadband households are unwilling to guess at their broadband speed, even when provided broad ranges as options. An additional 7% claim to subscribe to gigabit-speed services, a figure that seems high when considering the limited availability of such service offerings. Often, consumers only encounter their broadband speed infrequently, including the time that they choose a broadband package or in instances when they encounter slowdowns or lag in their broadband performance. However, some never note their subscribed broadband speed, particularly those that purchase broadband as part of a larger bundle, did not participate in their household’s selection of a service, or are not tech-savvy enough to perform an online speed test. Among consumer groups, younger consumers, multiscreen video users, and connected device owners are more likely to claim knowledge of their broadband speed than average consumers. In each case, these groups are more likely to experience their broadband service on a regular basis and to have encountered performance problems that would cause them to seek out that information. Balancing Speed and Price Across the US market, operators are aggressively pushing high-speed services, both to cover network investments and to counter competitive offerings. Migrating consumers to these higher speeds involves a three-way dance among the operator, consumers, and competitors. As competitive speeds within a market area increase, operators are faced with a difficult choice—wait for consumers to upgrade to a faster tier (at a higher price) or lift all subscribers in the area to a faster speed at their current price. Waiting for consumers to act allows the operator to enjoy higher revenues but risks churn. Generally, few households downgrade their broadband service. Only 7% of broadband households that claim their current broadband speed is faster than needed plan to downgrade to a less expensive service. This finding implies that most consumers do not perceive the unused speed and throughput as wasteful despite a belief that their speeds are higher than needed. As operators define their messaging and broadband product strategies, they must carefully strike a balance between the speed and prices offered in order to attract new subscribers. Over 50% of consumers indicate that their choice of a new provider was impacted by speed/price considerations. Operators need to continuously re-balance their offerings based on competitive offerings available. At present, faster speeds are resonating with a larger share of consumers than are lower prices in moving consumers to switch providers. While pricing matters, today’s consumers are driven by an increasing reliance on broadband for a variety of communication, functional, and entertainment needs—many of which are throughput intensive. This speed-based churn motivation suggests that current speeds are still not fully addressing consumers’ appetite for more and that demand for increasingly higher speeds will continue. Managing Consumer Expectations Among current broadband households, 50 Mbps appears to be an important inflection point for perception of broadband speed. The percentage of consumers that perceive their broadband speed as slower than needed drops sharply for those that claim to receive a service of 50 Mbps or more. At the same time, the percentage of consumers that perceive their broadband speed as faster than needed more than doubles for households with speeds of over 50 Mbps. Interestingly, surveys show that consumers with very high-speed connections still want faster broadband connections, even when their current speed is well above the average for other broadband households. As homes become accustomed to regular, robust broadband service and in-home Wi-Fi connections, they become increasingly reliant upon easy access and high-speed performance. The availability and quality of broadband quickly achieves the same level of expectations among consumers as the availability and quality of water or electricity—consumers never want to run out or run low. Excess is perceived as a safety net, just in case the consumer might need to use it. These consumers assess the quality of their broadband service by its performance and the operator by the number of connection problems encountered. Rather than being motivated by the benefits of broadband (which they already appreciate), they are motivated by avoidance of problems. By Parks Associates’ estimates, half of US broadband households will be smart homes by 2020. 44% of households who do not already own a smart home device plan to purchase one this year. The groundwork is laid for continued growth in 2016 and beyond by increased access to fixed and mobile broadband, the main catalyst for the connected home and consumer-based IoT. Operators hoping to capitalize on this expanding market will face difficult decisions regarding re-pricing and re-positioning of service tiers, keeping a close eye on consumer expectations, and increasing competition.

 Google secretly bought a small mobile app development startup last year Ken Yeung, VentureBeat Aug. 18, 2016, 6:40 PM 2,666 facebook linkedin twitter email print Apportable cofounders Collin Jackson (left) and Ian Fischer (right). Apportable Google secretly acquired the team at mobile app development startup Apportable more than a year ago, VentureBeat has learned. Terms of the deal have not been disclosed, but multiple sources said that it was an acqui-hire. Founded in 2011 by former Coolisis consultant Collin Jackson and former Webroot software engineer Ian Fischer to enable developers to allow iOS apps to run on Android devices without extensive changes to their code, Apportable is believed to have been purchased in March 2015. Sources indicate that not everyone was kept on after the deal closed, but Jackson and Fisher were retained and are now software engineers at Google, having officially joined in May 2015. Interestingly, it’s a bit of a homecoming for Jackson as he previous was a software engineering intern at the Mountain View, Calif.-based company. Jackson and Fisher are joined at Google by 11 members of Apportable’s engineering team, while the rest of the 65 employees have been let go. Even though it’s considered to be an acqui-hire, Apportable still remains operational, albeit with a skeleton crew. Following Jackson and Fisher’s relocation, Google installed Apportable software engineer Jim Terry as chief executive. Sources say that the proverbial lights are being kept on as there are some clients that still using Apportable’s technology. Google declined to comment. Although it’s now owned by Google, this isn’t the first time the two companies have worked together. As a mobile app development platform, Apportable needed to have a relationship with Google, and even received funding from that company’s early-stage venture firm GV. But this doesn’t seem to have been a great ending for Apportable, as sources shared that there were some financial difficulties at the company. Apportable has offered three products: an eponymous flagship service targeting enterprises, the open-source SpriteBuilder aimed at games, and Tengu which was formerly known as Apportable Indie and allowed developers to reuse Swift and Objective-C code without compromising on the native user interface. Many of these products have become casualties of the deal with Tengu seemingly taken offline — the site displays an error message. SpriteBuilder’s site remains online, but the app no longer is available at least in the Mac App Store in the U.S. Its SpriteBuilder store has an expired security certificate — it’s been outdated since January 2016 — and the blog has also not been updated since then. As for Apportable’s enterprise offering, if you try to access more details, it displays a programmatic error saying that it can’t find the right “template” to display. Further proof of Apportable’s change in ownership include the fact its contact page has also been taken offline and its office no longer exists — the current tenant is smart lock maker August. Jackson once described playing “Angry Birds” as his inspiration for Apportable, saying he was “frustrated that I couldn’t play it on my Android device, despite it having been released on iOS for 10 months. I started emailing top game developers and asking why they were all iOS exclusive, and found out that in most cases they wanted to support Android, but porting was slow and expensive.” It’s unclear about what Google is building with the Apportable team, but it’s likely that the company will produce more tools to encourage developers to not have to be forced to choose which operating system they should first build their app on. This could accelerate growth in the Android ecosystem, driving more development so more productivity, entertainment, gaming, and social apps are supported by your smartphone. Google may also be using the technology and team to build out its Fuchsia operating system. This wouldn’t be the first time Google has done deals to bring in tools that Android developers need. Last month, it acquired LaunchKit to add the mobile app development suite of products to its Developer Product Group, which contains resources around leveraging Google account log in, analytics, messaging, storage and sync, app testing, monetization, payments, gaming, maps, and monitoring performance. Let’s also not forget about the acquisition of Firebase to build better real-time apps and Agawi which powers streaming native mobile apps. The move could also be viewed as an effort by Google to stay one step ahead of its competitors, especially around making it easier for iOS apps to be supported on other platforms. Microsoft, earlier this year, acquired mobile app development company Xamarin to improve its developer tools and services. However, the Redmond, Wash.-based company killed off its Project Astoria initiative earlier this year, an effort to port Android apps to Windows 10 — basically creating universal apps. Instead, Microsoft shared that it would be focusing efforts on enabling conversion of iOS apps to Windows 10 devices, including Xbox and PCs. Apportable had previously raised $7.4 million in venture funding from investors ACE & Company, Betaworks, Eastlink Capital, Danhua Capital, GV, Salesforce Ventures, Y Combinator, and Alexis Ohanian.

Follow TechnoBuffalo Google announced on Friday that it will stop supporting Chrome apps in 2018. The company said that the apps were originally developed for a younger Web, back when developers didn’t have such advanced tools, like support for offline products or notifications. Things have changed, though, and so have Chrome’s users, so Google is adapting. You probably won’t even miss much. In fact, Google explained that just 1 percent of its users across Windows, Mac and Linux are actually “actively [using] Chrome packaged apps, and most hosted apps are already implemented as regular Web apps.” To start the transition, Google said it’ll clear out all of its Chrome apps from the Web store beginning during the second half of next year. Support will end in 2018. Google says developers should just migrate their current Chrome apps to the web. “As the capabilities of the web continue to grow, we’re excited to see what developers build next,” Google VP of product development Rahul Roy-Chowdhury said. “Alongside other browser vendors, we remain committed to investment in the web and enabling users and developers to benefit from its openness and reach.” Good point. By 2018, we’ll all be nose-deep in Oculus Rift units living in virtual reality anyway.

It was among the top communications app from tech giant Google. Perhaps, the upcoming Google Allo and Duo can be the best replacement for Hangout on Air. Since things has been changing, and that trend should also be on a mainstream communication tool. Google Hangouts has played a great role in enterprise app for consumers. Basically, Google knows that it’s the time for discontinuing the Hangouts on Air, and get users to YouTube Live, a more immersive and visualizing channel. This journey opens up a new direction for the next Duo and Allo to be in as well. The official confirm on the moving of Google+ to YouTube Live has been publicly announced to be on September 12. It is said that the Hangouts on Air feature is being redirected to YouTube Live, but other features of Showcase, Applause, and Q&A are staying. Notice that users might have to use Google Slides when they need the Q&A section. The company also promised that all of the user contents on Google Hangouts on Air won’t be removed. Users can still find the same content in Activity Log on YouTube Live under the read-only file. Setting up new YouTube Live account process also made easy by following pre-defined steps from Google. So, there is nothing to worry about it then. Google Hangouts on Air not only as simple as messaging app with voice and video calling, it serves consumers as the business tool in those years of operation. For now the next coming Google messaging and communication apps of Allo and Duo will take the roles of messaging and video calling. This could be so far the best expectations from those apps. Google Duo is already launched and users can have it downloaded from Google PlayStore for Android or Apple Store for an iOS version. Thus, this app will have new feature of voice calling to be added. Another time we should add this new app into the list of popular free messaging apps with IMs such as Facebook Messenger or WhatsApp. Share this: Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window) Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window) Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window) Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window) Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) Tags: GoogleGoogle hangoutsHangouts On AirYouTube Live Anna Fan Anytime I am not here on AmazinessNet, then you can find me writing in Vietnamese language about tips and tricks to learn real English at HocTiengAnh24H Next story Upcoming Moto Z Play Leaks its White Variant Previous story 4 Android-based Nokia Smartphones Coming In Q4, 2016 You may also like... 2 Google Safe Browsing Alerts Resolves Detected Malware URLs On Networks 7 Apr, 2016 1 Google Live Cases Available For Nexus 5X, Nexus 6, and 6P 16 Apr, 2016 1 Google Allo Could Be The Next Messaging Apps’ Dominant? 26 Aug, 2016 Follow: Find us on Facebook Find us on Facebook Subscribe to Blog via Email Get Instant News from Amaziness Subscribe Us!

Google’s new app might give them a run for their money By Komando Staff, Komando.com Digit.in So many companies are working on virtual reality headsets that will project our presence into far away places. Being there, without really being there, will be the wave of the future. But until that day comes, video calling is the next best thing. Video calling services keep bonds strong; not only can you hear their voice, but you can virtually be face to face. You can read your kids a bedtime story while you're away on a business trip, stare into your long-distance lover's eyes, or wish faraway relatives a Merry Christmas. You can already use Skype, Facebook Messenger, and FaceTime to make video calls but now, Google wants to throw their hat in the ring. Their service is called Google Duo and it has some cool features that may detract attention from the other services. The "Knock Knock" feature makes Google Duo stand out, it works like a peephole. With other services, you see the caller's contact picture but with Google Duo you can view a live video of the caller. Before you place a call, a selfie cam comes up so you can see what you look like. That way you can save yourself the embarrassment of video calling with food stuck in your teeth. Google says the video and sound quality will be better than the competition. If your Wi-Fi signal becomes weak during the call, Duo will automatically switch to data. And if you're receiving a call you'll have more time to answer it because your phone will ring for over a minute. The name Duo alludes to the fact that this service is for one on one calls. Unlike Google Hangout, Google Duo does not allow group calls or chats. The point is to communicate on a personal level. It also works on Apple and Android devices so everyone can use it. Please share this information with everyone.

Google has announced that after three years, they’re shutting down Chrome apps for Windows, Mac, and Linux.  In a blog post, vice president of product management Rahul Roy-Chowdhury writes that after its inception three years ago, Google is shutting down the app web store because many of its offerings are available on web applications that work on different types of browsers. Over the next year, Google says new Chrome apps will only be functional on Chrome OS devices, and in late 2017, the Chrome Web Store won’t show Chrome apps for Windows, Mac, or Linux.  Roy-Chowdhury writes that only 1 percent of Chrome users across these three operating systems were using Google apps at all. It’s a quiet end for what was once a niche platform that offered a home for a certain subset of game developers such as Goodgame Studios and Plarium, and its closure will mean that a host of browser games likely will only be playable on devices operating Chrome OS.  Previously, Google had shut down its Native Client technology, which briefly hosted games like Bastion in Google Chrome, and allowed developers to publish their games in the browser as well as on Steam.  Google is encouraging developers to migrate their Chrome apps to the web, if they haven’t done so already.  Related Jobs Disruptor Beam — FRAMINGHAM, Massachusetts, United States [11.22.16] Senior Producer Wargaming America, Inc. — Emeryville, California, United States [11.16.16] Senior Monetization Specialist The Walt Disney Company — Palo Alto, California, United States [11.11.16] Sr. Product Manager, Midcore Mobile Games Turner Broadcasting — Atlanta, Georgia, United States [10.25.16] Manager, Developer Relations - Cartoon Network Games [View All Jobs] Top Stories The challenges and rewards of designing local multiplayer games Appealing to kids as well as longtime fans in World of Final Fantasy Xbox One game streaming heading to Oculus Rift Blog: The financial reality of being indie and doing just okay [Next News Story]    [View All] 279595 newswire /view/news/279595/Google_Chrome_apps_are_riding_off_into_the_sunset.php Loading Comments TECHNOLOGY GROUP Black Hat Content Marketing Institute Content Marketing World Dark Reading Enterprise Connect Fusion GDC GTEC Gamasutra HDI ICMI InformationWeek Interop ITX Network Computing No Jitter VRDC COMMUNITIES SERVED Content Marketing Enterprise IT Enterprise Communications Game Development Information Security IT Services & Support WORKING WITH US Advertising Contacts Event Calendar Tech Marketing Solutions Contact Us Licensing Terms of Service Privacy Statement Copyright © 2016 UBM, All rights reserved

To make sure you never miss an issue, subscribe to my weely email briefing. News Google Plus takes another hit—Google has been marginalizing Google Plus for some time and the trend continues with the announcement that G+ Hangouts on Air will be discontinued as of September 12. Instead, Google is moving Hangouts on Air to YouTube Live. Several of Hangouts on Air’s best features aren’t making the transition, notably the Q&A tool. Google suggests you use the Q&A feature in Google Slides instead. The takeaway: Google Plus is dead. It just hasn’t fallen down yet. I am planning to move the For Immediate Release podcast community from Google+ to Facebook. If you have invested in Google Plus, you should start thinking about your transition strategy. Read more Twitter adds content filters—In an effort to combat harassment, Twitter has unveiled a “quality filter” that lets you “improve the quality of Tweets you see by using a variety of signals, such as account origin and behavior.” You can also now limit notifications to only people you follow. The takeaway: Twitter harassment has reached epidemic levels. Any tools to improve the experience are welcome. Read more NPR drops comments—It’s a bona fide trend: Publishers are dropping comments from their online content. NPR is the latest, announcing this week it will favor other channels for communication with listeners. A post from NPR’s managing editor for digital news noted that “the comment sections on NPR.org stories are not providing a useful experience for the vast majority of our users.” The post referenced Facebook and Twitter as the best channels, each of which already are major sources of engagement. The takeaway: When most publishers (and organizations) opened comments, it was the only way users could engage. Most commenting has shifted to other channels anyway. Comment moderation is a massive time suck. Encouraging conversation on social platforms where you already have a presence—and experimenting with new ones—makes good sense. Frankly, most of the comments on my content happens away from my blog on LinkedIn, Twitter, and Facebook, and that’s without me closing off the comments on my blog, which continues to serve as the primary home for my stuff. Read more Facebook traffic to news site drops by double digits—Facebook’s algorithm changes that favor personal posts over news content has exacted a price. Traffic from Facebook to many key news publishers dropped by double digits in the second quarter—as much as 50%. The biggest losers include Newsweek, The New York Times, Time Inc., Vox, CNN, The Washington Post, Politico, and Business Insider. While the algorithm change is certainly a key factor, another is the increasing volume of content published by news organizations resulting in lower reach for any given piece of content. The takeaway: A Facebook strategy is important, but only as part of a multi-channel approach. As I’ve been saying, it’s why a channel expert is very likely going to be a new position in most agencies and in-house communication departments. Read more Twitter usage will grow just 2%—eMarketer projects Twitter usage will grow only 2% this year, a hefty drop from eMarketer’s February forecast of an 8% increase. “By the end of this year, 52.2 million people in the US will access their Twitter accounts at least once a month,” according to eMarketer, reflecting Twitter’s continuing struggle to grow its user base. Twitter’s share of social network users—281%—represents a drop from last year. The takeaway: Twitter is, without question, an important channel, but it’s also a publicly owned company and growth is vital to its survival. Few of its innovations have kicked off a new surge of growth. I wouldn’t be surprised to see Twitter acquired in the next year or two. Read more Pepsi is first to use a promoted Twitter sticker—Twitter introduced virtual stickers in June, not unlike Snapchat emojis, filters, and lenses. Now, Pepsi is the first to pay for a “#Promoted Stickers” campaign. Pepsi developed 50 stickers that will be included among all the various Twitter stickers. The takeaway: I can’t wait to see if users add Pepsi stickers to their photos. With apologies to Twitter, I just don’t see the platform being used for personal photo sharing—certainly not like Instagram and Snapchat. But never dismiss Pepsi marketing ideas. They’re known for successful innovation in the social space. Read more Instagram adds event channel to Explore lineup—Instagram has introduced a new channel to its Explore tab that spotlights video from concerts, sports, and other live events, personalized for each user based on their location and interests. Instagram is sourcing the content from users who share video from these events. The takeaway: Instagram is taking on Snapchat’s discover channels, which are hand-curated, limiting the ability to personalize them. While some may complain that the various apps are getting homogenous, Instagram is making smart moves to compete with Snapchat’s growing popularity and keep its half-billion monthly active users from defecting. For communicators, it creates an incentive to share a lot of video from marketing and other company-related events. Read more U.S. to relinquish control of Internet governance—It has long been the plan, but the actual handover of authority for governance of the Internet is now imminent. Effective October 1, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) will assume control of the domain-name system. ICANN—a nonprofit multi-stakeholder organization—has operated under American control since it was created and incorporated in 1998. The transition has been supported by the Obama, Bush, and Clinton administrations, yet it’s expected to produce partisan backlash. The takeaway: For those interested in how the Internet works, this is a big deal. Don’t expect to see anything change in your day-to-day online activities, though. Read more Instagram begins business profile rollout—Instagram has started its previously planned rollout of business profiles in Europe, the Middle East, and Asia. Inspired by Facebook’s Business Pages, the Instagram profiles feature a large contact button that lets users get in touch with a business via text, phone, or email. The profiles also feature a set of analytics and a feature for boosting strongly performing images as an ad. The profiles will come to the U.S., Australia and New Zealand within a few months and globally by the end of the year. The takeaway: If your company has an Instagram account, there will be no reason not to set up a business profile. Read more Emojis get a conference—Emojicon will be held in san Francisco in November, featuring speakers like the president of Unicode and co-chair of the Unicode Emoji Subcommittee, and the founder of Emojipedia. Sponsors include Panda Express, which wants to see a dumpling added to the emoji set. The takeaway: My apologies to those who were waiting for emojis to vanish. A conference of its own bodes well for the future of the visual messaging tool. Read more Trends Cars are set to become an advertising and marketing platform—In case you missed the news, Ford’s CEO shared a post on LinkedIn this week announcing the company will have a fully-autonomous fleet of cars on the road by 2021. The fact that you won’t have to pay attention to the road in a few years means the 30-to-60 minutes everyone spends driving every day (according to the American Driving Survey) will become free time. Don’t think for a moment advertisers and marketers aren’t salivating over the prospect of having your attention while you’re trapped in your vehicle. While billboards are likely to suffer (with passengers likely looking down as long as they don’t need to watch the road), Augmented Reality, audio, and geo-local deals delivered via smartphone are among the technologies marketers will use to capture your attention. The takeaway: Anything’s better than those God-awful video monitors playing a loop of news and entertainment in taxis. There’s a real opportunity here to innovate and create genuine experiences for passengers. Read more Are you ready for Generation Z?—I can’t scroll through a feed without seeing half a dozen items addressing Millennials. Conversely, I rarely see anything dealing with Generation Z, the oldest of whom turn 21 this year. They’re similar to Millennials in a lot of ways, but they don’t align everywhere. They are, according to EY’s head of recruiting, “not a shy bunch. They’re more confident and assertive about their goals, and a lot more knowledgeable about employers than Millennials were at the same age.” They want to do work that makes a difference and has a positive impact on the world. They’re more concerned about job security than Millennials, having watched their parents’ careers tank as part of the Great Recession. They’re also more inclined to develop their skills and build their careers with a single employer than jump from job to job. The takeaway: Knowing the generation that’s just starting to infiltrate the workforce can help with employer branding efforts in order to recruit the best workers and in communicating with them once they’re on board. Read more The speed bump in the native advertising expressway—Love it or hate it, native advertising (aka sponsored content) isn’t going anywhere. It’s making too much money for publishers who have struggled to find a revenue stream in the digital world. But there’s a problem: Only 21% of sponsors are renewing their content, a rate described as weak. Some 40% of publishers say their renewal rates are below 50%. One reason for the hesitancy in renewing: advertisers aren’t sure if they’re getting an adequate return. Eight-five percent of native advertising dollars are going to the top five publishers, with the rest divided among the hundreds of smaller publishers offering native advertising. The takeaway: I don’t expect this to spell the end of native advertising. Instead, innovation needs to occur around metrics, the kinds of native services publishers offer, and value for smaller companies who advertise with niche publishers. Read more Employee advocacy programs come to highly regulated industries—Employee advocacy programs are ridiculously (and appropriately) popular, but they have been slow to find their way into financial services and healthcare organizations, where one ill-advised post by an employee can trigger huge regulatory headaches. Shifting demographics (two-thirds of the global workforce is under 35 years old) is leading even those industries to dip their toes into employee advocacy. The easiest and safest way to start: Tools that deliver approved ready-to-share content to employees. Humana and Capital One are using Dynamic Signal. The takeaway: Operating in the shadow of regulation is no reason to avoid employee advocacy. It’s only a reason to develop the policies and training that ensures compliance. Read more Pokémon Go should inspire a code of ethics for AR games—Pokémon Go is something new which (sadly but not surprisingly) is resulting in all manner of misbehavior, which should lead to an industry-wide set of ethical standards for similar games and tools. The takeaway: I couldn’t agree more, but industries are slow to develop such standards and, once (if ever) adopted, even slower to abide by them. Consider the codes of ethics for communications! Ultimately, this failure frequently results in government regulation. As companies find themselves under increasing pressure to take stands on social issues, coming together to adopt such standards should be a no-brainer. Read more Research Employees have ideas but companies aren’t listening—Nearly 60% of employees surveyed by the Medallia Institute say their leaders aren’t listening to their ideas for improving the customer experience. That’s a huge wasted opportunity, given that 78% of frontline employees say their leaders have made customer experience a top priority. Sixty-one percent of employees say they’re likely to come up with new ways to delight customers, 56% can think of ways to improve processes and practices, 47% have ideas for improving training and development, and 43% know how to reduce costs. The takeaway: Imagine that—employees doing the work have ideas for how to improve it. Communication doesn’t work if all you’re doing is talking. Listening needs to become a strategic priority that can best be led by the internal communications department. More to come on this; watch my blog for details. Read more Branded content campaigns grow, but so do views—Branded content campaigns grew 75% in the second quarter, suggesting that Mark Schaefer’s fear of “content crash” is well-founded. However, views of branded content grew by 2.2 times, exceeding the growth of campaigns with the click-through rate and overall viewing time remaining constant. The takeaway: The appetite for branded content, especially in the U.S., is unabated. I’d worry about content crash as a theoretical issue in order to ensure you’re always innovating ways to reach customers with content, but it just doesn’t seem to be happening as quickly as Mark anticipated. Read more A single channel is key to the customer experience—It takes two or more channels for 55% of customers to resolve an issue with a company, according to a study from The Northridge Group, and 44% believe companies don’t make it easy for customers to contact them. Consumers value first-contact resolution and 77% have turned to social media to try to get an answer or solution, even though 21% say they never get a response from companies they contact via social media. The takeaway: Creating a great customer experience is largely about doing the things that satisfy a customer. It’s great to create new experiences but they won’t help much if the customer is frustrated trying to get a simple answer to a question. I am increasingly amazed that so many companies invest so much in customer experience yet let queries languish on Facebook and Twitter. Read more Microinfluencers dominate influencer marketing—Brands are increasingly eschewing celebrities for microinfluencers. They may not be famous celebrities but they do have dedicated, highly engaged followers. A survey of microinfluencers found 60% believe Instagram is the best platform for engaging; only 18% said the same of Facebook. Snapchat is the new favorite channel among half of the microinfluencers surveyed, but only 1% favor it as a means of connecting with followers. The takeaway: Given that 84% of respondents charge less than $250 per Instagram post, microinfluencers could be a smart investment. The trick is finding them, but that’s why you’d want to connect with an influencer discovery tool like Little Bird. Read more Retailers are missing the boat by ignoring SMS—SMS text messaging is one of the least frequently used modes of communication for retailers. Only 29% are employing it, versus 97% for 3mail, 66% for phone, 82% for social media, and 32% for mobile apps. A study by Internet Retailer notes that retailers that are using text messaging “are seeing success in terms of efficiency, reach, and business impact.” The takeaway: Messaging apps have become the smartphone homescreen for a lot of people who also have embraced old-fashioned text messages. It may seem old-school, but it’s consistent with an undeniable trend. Read more Chatbots Chatbots are disruptive—The sheer number of chatbots functioning on Facebook Messenger, Kik, SMS, and other platforms is disruptive all by itself. Now, we’re seeing the rise of bots that “use a compilation of various chatbot languages,” hybrid applications being employed by Domino’s Pizza and CNN, among others. These bots improve user engagement and brand satisfaction. More advanced bots “will cause a revolution,” using proprietary Artificial Intelligence algorithms to project a unique personality. “They can create and deliver completely measurable advertising campaigns that bring together all the elements of integrated marketing,” according to VentureBeat. The takeaway: Most of the communicators I talk to are still only mildly curious about chatbots. There are 18,000 now running just on Facebook Messenger. Bots will play a significant role in all kinds of communication. Ignoring them now is like ignoring desktop publishing in 1986. Read more New York Times issues cease-and-desist to a chatbot—Chris McBride created a non-commercial chatbot called JULIA that answers food and cooking questions and recommends recipes from various websites. Some of those recipes come from The New York Times. Sharing a link on the web to a Times recipe is no big deal, but with a chatbot on a mobile device, the Times claims JULIA “is disintermediating us from the end user of the content.” The difference, according to a Medium post by McBride: “On the web, links are openly visible. Because a chatbot is a black box, however, it’s difficult, if not impossible for a third party to know how extensive a chatbot’s database of links is or how frequently those links are presented or accessed.” The takeaway: As McBride notes, chatbots are new territory. Publishers and developers should start working together to figure out how they can benefit one another rather than resort to legal action as the first knee-jerk reaction. Read more Kik rethinks chatbots—Kik CEO Ted Livingston notes there hasn’t yet been a “killer bot” despite the thousands that have been built (including more than 20,000 for Kik). One reason, Livingston suggests, is the laser-like focus on human-like conversation. Even without conversation, there is huge utility for using bots, including ease of use (compared to apps), ease of discovery, the ability to use one app to access thousands of chatbots that previously would have required separate apps, and the integration of bots with messaging (that is, a common interface for interaction).  The takeaway: I earlier reported that Silicon valley is hiring writers from Hollywood to write the conversational scripts for chatbots. Don’t feel like you need to take that kind of approach to get started. Providing a more intuitive approach to interactions that currently are available only via your app will be enough to attract consumers who are increasingly agreeable to bots. (As Livingston says, on Kik alone, users have exhanged nearly 2 billion messages with bots in less than four months.) Read more Virtual and Augmented Reality Intel will produce a “merged reality” headset—Intel has thrown its hat in the VR/AR ring with Project Alloy, a wireless headset that will allow users to see their own hands and use them to interact with objects in a Virtual Reality space. Equipped with RealSense cameras, “the headset could detect a user’s finger movement and allow users to manipulate objects within a simulation, thus negating the need for controllers.” The takeaway: Do we really need to factor “merged reality” into the VR/AR mix? Oh, well. The concept is an important one that should create even greater utility for VR uses by businesses and brands that not only want to provide an immersive experience, but encourage real engagement and interaction. Being inside a new-model car is great. Being able to drive it, though, is awesome. Read more Here come celebrity AR holograms—Companies are already working on 3D captures of celebrities for AR and, eventually, VR performances. No word yet on which celebrities are involved, but the idea for now is to “go to a venue and see a convincing virtual concert or lecture no matter where you sit, and with more freedom of movement for the star of the show.” The takeaway: Or feel like you’re at the venue when you’re sitting in your living room in your bathrobe. Read more Video Bye-bye, Blab—For a while there, Blab was all the rage. The livestreaming app attracted nearly 4 million users in its first year, but now it’s gone, the victim of too much churn. Like Meerkat before it, Blab had little trouble attracting broadcasters, but audiences were slow to return to the app. The company plans to reintroduce the tool as a video chat tool for small groups to engage with one another. The takeaway: Some were too quick to proclaim Blab the future of livestreaming. The fact is, the marketplace is crowded and Facebook and Twitter have a lot of clout along with huge existing user bases. I’m not optimistic about Blab’s pivot, either, given that Google Hangouts and Skype already accommodate multi-participant video chat. Read more Mobile/social video on the rise—Smartphones now account for 8.6 of the 50-plus hours we spend looking at screens each week, and social networking accounts for four hours weekly. “The overlap between smartphone and social network use is quite significant, which has led a number of companies to test the viability of social-mobile (SoMo) networks for video delivery,” according to Rapid TV News. SoMo video represents less than 15 minutes of screen time (10% of the time spent on smartphones and 14% of all the time spent watching video on smartphones), but with the shift of screen time to mobile and social networks app embracing video, “all the trends are lining up in favor of massive growth in SoMo video over the next decade,” according to a research analyst. The Diffusion Group forecasts SoMo video will surge from 685 million daily viewing minutes this year to 7.4 billion by 2025. The takeaway: Channel management is a growing occupation. I spoke with the global head of internal communications for a financial services company who just hired a head of channels just for employee communication. Knowing how to produce or repurpose videos for mobile social consumption will be a routine activity in short order. Read more Social platform popularity comes at YouTube’s expense—Sixty-five percent of marketers prefer social channels Facebook, Snapchat and Twitter for digital video campaigns, beating YouTube by 10 percentage points. The study by Trusted Media Brands found 65% of agency respondents and 42% of marketers plan to increase their digital video investment in the next 12 months, and 71% of all respondents could use live-streaming video advertising in the next year. The takeaway: Don’t give up on YouTube, but be strategic on how you use each platform. YouTube is terrible for discovery but great if you can build followers to a channel. Also, social media videos get lost after they move out of the news feed, whereas they remain evergreen on YouTube. Read more Twitter video ads perform best—Take this study with a grain of salt since it was co-produced by Twitter itself, but the same video ad is nearly twice as memorable in a Twitter video feed compared to other premium sites (i.e., Facebook). The study—jointly produced by twitter and IPG Media Lab, showed strong performance of video ads both in the feed and as pre-rolls in other videos. The takeaway: Did I mention you should take this with a grain of salt? Read more Video’s role in purchase decisions gets bigger—Video has become an important consideration in online purchase decisions, according to research from visual commerce company Invodo, whose marketing VP insists that product video is no longer optional. Among the report’s findings: One-third of respondents said they’re more likely to shop on a website other than Amazon when it includes a lot of product videos, shoppers are more likely to watch a video on a product page than anywhere else, and nearly 70% of shoppers say mobile videos allow for impulse shopping. Seventy percent of shoppers also say they rely on online videos to improve their in-store experience.  The takeaway: Must I say it? Especially if your company sells pricier items, offering product videos is a requirement. Read more This week’s wrap image is from Yellowstone National Park’s Flickr account.

SUBSCRIBE Google Local Business Cards or Posts about to roll out to ‘thousands’ of SMBs Search feature will soon be broadly accessible to local businesses. Greg Sterling on August 19, 2016 at 5:50 pm More In March, Google started showing “Local Business Cards” as part of the Google Posts system. This allows content providers or businesses or candidates to control the content that appears in the carousel near the top of search results. Below is an example from the March experimental launch, for Healthy Choice Massage. Now, according to information obtained by Mike Blumenthal, Google will dramatically expand availability of Google Local Posts from a “few dozen” to “thousands” of small businesses. Google Posts was created with mobile users in mind, but they display on PCs as well. Google’s intent is to allow the business owner or marketer (or candidate) to communicate directly with users in search results, including content or information that the Knowledge Panel doesn’t allow. Content is also shareable from within the carousel. When I initially wrote about Local Posts in March, I speculated that it could be quite significant for local SEO — or local visibility, at least. Andrew Shotland did a further analysis with some predictions about who would benefit: Google, savvy local businesses, agencies and spammers. At the time of the initial experiment, Google was uncertain about a broader rollout. That question appears to have been answered by Mike Blumenthal’s Google sources, suggesting the company has seen good results and feedback.

That's a market cap of about $543 billion, just shy of Apple (AAPL)'s roughly $588 billion market capitalization.  The deal size for Google's IPO was $1.7 billion.

Google Will Discontinue Chrome Apps for Windows, Mac, and Linux in Early 2018 GO Chrome apps will continue to work on Chrome OS Aug 19, 2016 22:55 GMT  ·  By Catalin Cimpanu  ·  Share:  Google has announced today plans to discontinue Chrome apps in early 2018 for Windows, Mac, and Linux users. Chrome apps are self-contained web applications that run inside the Chrome browser, separately from web pages, inside special containers. Google introduced Chrome apps in the Chrome browser in 2010, and they were a moderate success. Chrome apps weren't as successful as everyone thought Developers could create two types of apps, namely hosted and packaged apps. Google says that only 1 percent of all Windows, Mac, and Linux users used packaged apps, which are like self-standing desktop apps that could be launched via Chrome or the Chrome App Launcher (retired last month). As for hosted Chrome apps, Google says that most of them had web-based versions, accessible via any URL and any other browser, so there was no reason to keep a Chrome-specific app just for that. The Google team also justifies its decision to retire Chrome apps by saying that Web-based apps have evolved over the years, and the web provides the necessary tools for developers to create web-based apps as powerful as the Chrome apps. Since Chrome apps were created in 2010, the W3C has released HTML5, CSS3, and approved a ton of APIs that support service workers, web push notifications, better multimedia playback, and tons more. Additionally, the once frozen-over JavaScript standard has also received two major updates. The deprecation timeline Starting late 2016, Google says that newly published Chrome apps will only be available to Chrome OS users, but not Windows, Mac, and Linux. Users will be able to access, use and update existing Chrome apps. From the second half of 2017, users won't be able to access Chrome apps on the Chrome Web Store if they're using Windows, Mac, or Linux. Beginning with early 2018, users will not be able to load any type of Chrome apps, except on Chrome OS. Chrome apps still play a central role in Chrome OS, Google's browser-based OS that comes installed on all Chromebook devices. Google's Rahul Roy-Chowdhury, VP Product Management, says that Chrome apps will continue to work on Chrome OS "for the foreseeable future." #Chrome apps#Google#Chrome#Google Chrome#Chrome OS subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Google Working on New OS That's Not Android, Chrome OS, or Linux-Related Google Will Kill Flash in Chrome by the End of the Year Firefox 48 Released with Multi-Process Support, Mandatory Add-On Signing Opera 39 Comes with Video and Search Pop Out Feature, Personalized Newsreader iPhone 8 to Feature Traditional Wireless Charging like the Samsung Galaxy S7 Lenovo Builds a New Microsoft Surface Clone and It Looks Fabulous Anonymous Hackers Want McAfee to Be Trump’s Security Adviser, Call for March Hackers Could Infect Headphones to Spy on You HTC Desire 650 Announced, a Low Mid-End Smartphone for the Masses Glossy Black Galaxy S7 edge Leaks in Live Pictures Download Windows 10 64-bit Drivers for Acer’s Aspire TC-710 Desktop Model Intel Rolls Out Several New BIOS Versions for Its NUC Kits and Compute Sticks    Chrome apps in the Google Chrome browser Related Apps SkyHistory: Record and save your Skype chat history and call logs with this application that offers contact management and bookmarking of important messages Outlook4Gmail: Synchronize your Outlook and Gmail accounts by transferring all the important data like contacts and calendar events between them Emby Server: A media server that you can use to organize your entire video, audio and photo collection and access it remotely from multiple devices WebSite Auditor: Enable on-page optimization for your website and assure its place in the top rankings of Google thanks to this comprehensive SEO program Betternet: Navigate the Internet anonymously or with a different IP address and get the opportunity to visit any website, using this VPN server application SEO SpyGlass: Monitor and manage the backlinks for your website in order to increase its online popularity and overall visibility, with the help of this handy tool Rank Tracker: Monitor your website's search engine rankings with the help of this comprehensive and reliable application, dedicated to webmasters Reader comments Load old comments   President-Elect Donald Trump Says He’ll No Longer Go Bananas Online more on: Donald Trump i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2016 Softpedia.

Search for: Welcome Philosophy Services What Sets Us Apart Client Letters Blog Contact Us Leading Tech Companies All Chasing The Same “Next Big Things” August 16, 2016 10:23 AM | Leave a Comment | Chad Brand I miss the old days of tech investing. Times were simpler. Companies were more focused. There were one or two companies that tended to be dominant within a certain fragment of the industry. Google was search and online advertising. Amazon was e-commerce. Intel was chips. eBay was marketplace. Microsoft was operating systems and productivity software. Cisco was networking. Apple was high-end devices. Facebook was social networking. Netflix was movies. You get the picture. Oh how times have changed. The tech landscape now has led us down a different path. Each of these companies has been extremely successful in conquering their home turf. They are all wildly profitable and have more money than they know what to do with. So they repurchase shares and pay dividends and buy startups to add talent and new technology. And after they do all of that they still have billions of dollars extra sitting around. What to do? It appears the answer now is to become a tech conglomerate. Heck, if we took over one area of the marketplace, why not shoot for the stars? Why not be everything to everybody? So now when we talk about the leading tech companies (Apple, Facebook, Google, Amazon, Microsoft) the future looks far less predictable. In the old world Tesla would be the de facto electric self-driving car play. But Google is building cars. So is Apple. In the old world Oculus would have been the virtual/augmented reality play. But in the new world Facebook acquires them and then Microsoft and Apple and Google all start working on the same thing. In the old world Netflix would be the benchmark for streaming video. Nobody would argue that households looking to get rid of their $100/month cable bills would substitute them with a half dozen individual services that cost $10-$20 per month. The expensive cable bundle is no worse than a bundle of Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Hulu, HBO Now, YouTube Red, and CBS All Access. And as if there are not enough competitors vying for your TV dollars, it was recently reported that Apple has decided it has identified the next big thing; producing original TV content. Are you kidding me? I understand that self-driving cars and streaming over-the-top video and virtual reality could all very well be huge markets over the long term. But everyone can’t be a winner. Do you really think GM and Ford lack the ability to produce self-driving, electric cars? Are the Big Three auto makers going to be replaced by Apple, Google, and Tesla a decade from now? Are we really going to cancel our Comcast service and pay the same amount of money for less content by buying subscriptions to 6 or 8 streaming services? The leading tech companies got to where they are today by being laser-focused on creating or improving upon one big tech trend. Becoming indispensable in that arena has made them billions of dollars and created a ton of shareholder wealth. They did not win out after a long, brutal battle with the other tech titans at the time. The biggest risk to Apple, for example, is that the innovation they are focused on revolves solely around virtual reality, electric cars, and streaming TV and movies. That is not how Apple became Apple. And it is not the secret for them to stay at the top. The same goes for Google and Microsoft and Facebook. As long as these companies are battling against each other, as opposed to paving their own way to the future, I am afraid that those of us hoping for the next big thing to come out of the mega tech stalwarts may be disappointed. To truly develop a market-leading position you have to try something new and do so long before everyone else. Nobody is likely to catch Amazon in the public cloud computing space (although Google and Microsoft are trying, of course). They are years ahead because they saw the trend before anyone else and went all-in to the number one. Enjoy this post?

Here's how much you would have made if you'd invested in Google at its IPO Jillian D'Onfro Aug. 19, 2016, 6:33 PM 176,597 facebook linkedin twitter email print Here's the crew at the IPO. Cofounder Sergey Brin stayed in Mountain View that day because he didn't want to take a red-eye flight to New York.Getty Images Google went public exactly 12 years ago today, August 19. In the immediate aftermath, employees who made big money were warned not to buy BMWs (or else they'd get their windshields smashed) or check the stock ticker at work (or else they'd have to buy the person who caught them a share). People who bought shares on August 19, 2004, and kept it have made off well, as the stock price of Google and parent company Alphabet has skyrocketed. If you bought one share of Google in 2004 at its initial public offering price of $85, then it would be two shares worth $1,575 today, taking into account Google's stock split. That's a stunning 1,752.94% change, or about 18.5x. So, let's assume that you bought more than one share: If you bought about $1,000 of stock — about 11.76 shares — at the IPO price in 2004, then you'd have about $18,522 today. If you'd invested $10,000, then you'd have $185,384.53, a gain of $175,384. If you'd been high-rolling with a $100,000 investment, then you'd have a stunning $1,853,022.60. Not too shabby. Although the company has changed tremendously in the past 12 years — there are now separate divisions for self-driving cars, curing death, and improving cities — the core search experience looks pretty much the same. Thanks to The Internet Archive, we can revisit those early days and see exactly what Google used to look like: View As: One Page Slides If you went to Google.com in 1997, here's what you'd see: The Way Back Machine / Google The first of the two links would take you here: The Way Back Machine / Google The link called "might-work-some-of-the-time-prototype that is much more up to date" would take you to this page: The Way Back Machine / Google By December, that was the official home page, and if you navigated your way to "Help!" then you'd get this explanation: The Way Back Machine / Google That early site also had some fun, user-submitted logos, too: The Way Back Machine / Google And pics of what were, apparently, old logos that the company used: The Way Back Machine / Google Larry Page and Sergey Brin made the first Google Doodle in August 1998. They were heading to Burning Man in the Nevada desert and wanted people to know where the Google crew would be for a few days, so they added the festival's logo. Google By mid-1999, Google had simplified its home page: The Way Back Machine / Google We got our first look at non-beta Google in October 1999: The Way Back Machine Only minor updates in mid-2000, as Google adds a few links: The Way Back Machine / Google By the end of the year, though, Google finally centered its logo and started promoting its ad program: The Way Back Machine / Google By the end of the year, Google already offered 25 different language options — it now offers 80: The Way Back Machine / Google In 2001, the home page looks largely the same, but other parts of the site are more fleshed out. Here's the culture page: The Way Back Machine / Google It added different tabs in 2001: The Way Back Machine / Google Google ditched the blue boxes in 2004: The Way Back Machine / Google Everything stayed pretty much the same, until Google moved its different search options up top: The Way Back Machine / Google Google ditched the ugly shadowing on its font in 2010: The Way Back Machine / Google In 2011, it added a black box around its top toolbar: The Way Back Machine / Google Google updated to a simpler, more elegant logo in 2013: The Way Back Machine / Google Shortly after the company blew up its corporate structure in August 2015, forming Alphabet, the company modernized its look.

Advertising versus the tech industry Cremona explained the differences he has found between his 25 years of advertising experience to that of working with Google, which he deemed “an engineer’s company, not an advertising agency.” “I thought I knew everything about mobile, but then I realised that in advertising, we are very good at becoming experts in any field within 24 hours – but we do that very superficially. Whereas Google goes much deeper into their work.” © Gallo Images Cremona also spoke highly of Google's flat structure, a strategy known as ‘management on the edge of chaos’, that challenged the hierarchical structure he had experienced in advertising. He explained that pyramids in companies can lend to people refusing to do work based on it not being part of their contract, whereas Google’s approach increased productivity. “Another thing I like about the flat structure approach is that because of the consensus that needs to be reached in order to approve an idea, you really need to be passionate and motivated about your idea in order to see it through.” Cremano then shared Google’s creative mantras with the audience, which also differed greatly from his experience of advertising: • The product is the idea • Users above all • Demos and documentaries, not ads. To this point, Cremano mentioned, “This destroyed me, because one of the most beautiful things in my ad years was using fantasy to create worlds that didn’t exist.” • Make people smile, cry or think The challenges of mobile The first challenge regarding mobile that Cremona highlighted was that people’s attention span has decreased since the year 2000 from 12 seconds to eight seconds. Cremona offered the following solution: “You need to find a way to communicate to people relevantly in the micro moments (those three seconds they take to go online on their phone).” According to Cremona, ad blocking poses the second challenge to mobile advertisers. “What ad blocking says to me is that people are not happy with the kind of advertising that is on mobile today. The average click-through rate of display ads is 0.06%. It means that most probably, the 0.06% of people that ended up watching the ads could not find the X button to close them, because it was too small.” One further challenge was around what platform one should use in one’s campaign. “Every day is not only a creative struggle, it’s a media struggle. You have to know what channels are relevant to people and know how to use these in a relevant way,” explains Cremona. Make brands relevant Cremona made the point that in order to engage an audience in a relevant way, brands need to adapt international brands to gain local insights. Cremona likened speaking a global language in places where you should actually ‘speak local’ to trying to pick up sushi with billiard sticks. “It’s very difficult and not always successful,” he says. He provided the example of an international campaign showing Sesame Street's Cookie Monster, well-known to American audiences. The campaign reached fourteen countries, but Cremona felt it could’ve been improved. “As much as the campaign was amusing, had they used a character that was recognised by the local market, such as Cheburashka who is an equivalent in Russia, they would’ve been more relevant,” says Cremona. Cremona ended the seminar with a captivating campaign that raised awareness around disabled parking bays in Russia by displaying a hologram before non-disabled drivers requesting that they respect drivers with disabilities and find another parking bay. “Work really has to have an effect on people’s lives, such as the work created for Dislife.ru which turned a flat sign into a real person.” View the campaign below: ‹    Like Save Email Print PDF Advertisement Follow Connect (Pasqua Heard knows me) Colleague Weve done business together Weve worked together Met in person Interacted with online Classmate Friend Family Follow only Create new group Pasqua Heard's articles About Pasqua HeardEditorial Assistant at Bizcommunity Comment on thisComment Comment guidelines and disclaimer LEGAL DISCLAIMER: This Message Board accepts no liability of legal consequences that arise from the Message Boards (e.g. defamation, slander, or other such crimes).

Infosec duo exploits OCR flaw to nab a website's HTTPS cert AT&T wants Time Warner Google has asked a US court to stop a former MySpace investor from repeatedly filing suit against it. The web advertising giant this week told (PDF) the US District Court for Northern California that Brad Greenspan has been burdening its lawyers and racking up its legal bills by constantly filing motions in a lawsuit that was dismissed more than a year ago. Greenspan, who held a key role during the genesis of MySpace, was a 10 per cent shareholder in the social network when it was acquired by Rupert Murdoch's NewsCorp in 2005. He has long claimed that the $580m sale price was too low. In 2014, he sued Google, claiming the Chocolate Factory helped to delay sale to NewsCorp and drive down the selling price. Specifically, Greenspan accused Google of using a no-poaching deal with Yahoo! and Ask.com to get both competitors to back off bids to provide search services for MySpace, in the process driving down the site's potential value. "News Corp was able to purchase MySpace at a severe discount by purchasing MySpace during a time when Google was withholding a bid for exclusive search engine contract, and when [MySpace board member Geoff] Yang and [board member Geoff] Carlick directed MySpace not to renew an exclusive search engine contract with Yahoo or any other search engine in exchange for Google’s agreement not to poach Ask.com’s employees," Greenspan's original complaint reads. The case was dismissed by the court on May 15, 2015. Google argued that, since that ruling, Greenspan has filed motions to appeal with the court 16 times. After the judge struck down the motion to appeal in May of this year, Google says it has received seven more motions from Greenspan. Those motions include claims that errors such as incorrect dates (PDF) and improperly filled out forms (PDF) by Google and IAC's lawyers should allow the case to continue. "None of these post-judgment filings do anything but try to advance his dismissed claims," Google argues in the filing. "Indeed, Greenspan is simply (and blatantly) ignoring the court’s orders and needlessly burdening the Court and the parties with wholly unnecessary and unwarranted motion practice." In total, the Chocolate Factory estimates that dealing with Greenspan's constant filings have cost it $21,793.50 in legal fees, money it wants repaid along with an order barring Greenspan from filing further motions without first obtaining court permission. Google also notes Greenspan's previous attempts to either file or intervene in four other suits related to the MySpace acquisition. He also attempted to intervene in the 2014 Silicon Valley wage-fixing suit. "Google does not file this motion lightly, but enough is enough," the complaint reads. "The time has come for the Court to deem Greenspan a vexatious litigant and constrain his ability to file any further pleadings in this closed case." El Reg was unable to reach Greenspan for comment, but we'll update this story if we hear from him. ® Sponsored: Magic quadrant for enterprise mobility management suites Tips and corrections 18 Comments More from The Register David Bowie: Musician, actor... tech admirer Obituary The muso was the medium 50 Comments The Bong Diaries, Pt.94: Bowie, Martha... and where's my knighthood? ¡Bong!

The Moto X, unlike other Android flagships at the time, was not a specs hero but instead offered lean, effective software and the ability to personalize the device through Motomaker. The Moto X defined the company’s time as an extension of Mountain View; fun and vibrant, but it wasn’t enough. In 2014, Google pulled the plug on the Motorola experiment and sold the company to Chinese tech giant Lenovo. We had to wait several years to see what affect the new ownership would have, and in 2016 we finally have our answer with the Moto Z. Like the Moto X it replaces, the Z defines the company’s time under its new owners, and Lenovo has certainly made its mark. The first “Lenovorola” product does away with everything the company forged under Google. And that’s not a bad thing. A New Era The Moto X, and its various successors, were great phones but the Moto Z forges its own path, starting with the hardware. Gone is the colorful, customizable design of the X in favor of a more vanilla modern smartphone look. It’s made of metal and glass, looks sharp and collects fingerprints like a monster. To spice up the aesthetics, Motorola opted to make this the thinnest smartphone on the market. At just 5.19mm, it’s ridiculously, ludicrously, slim. So svelte, in fact, it’s not hyperbolic to call it “impossibly thin.”A phone this tiny shouldn’t exist, has no reason to, but the Z makes a better effort at contextualizing its size than most phones. The real compelling aspect of the device are the swappable, snapable accessories, dubbed Moto Mods, that give the phone a modular lean. These add-ons offer various improvements, like more battery, a better speaker, even a projector, but they also add a significant amount of depth. Reducing the initial size helps offset the added bulk of the Mods. It’s a decent argument, until you consider that Motorola is simultaneously releasing a thicker version of the phone, the Moto Z Force, that comes in at around 7mm. That fact dwindles the Z’s impressive profile to nothing more than novelty. If it doesn’t offer any real benefit, the 5.19mm frame is at least striking, but I also found it to reduce the phone’s comfort level. It’s simply too thin to feel good in the hand, like a lover that’s all elbows and knees. It doesn’t feel fragile, Motorola did an impeccable job with construction and the Z is solid enough to take a tumble or two. It just doesn’t feel like it wants to be in your hand like phones (i.e. the Moto X) that have invitingly curved backs. During my test period, I preferred to have a Style Shell snapped to the back of the Moto Z. Style Shells keep the spirit of Motomaker alive by offering a handful of affordable backs that give users different looks to apply to the Z. The best part, though, is that they fill out the phone, removing the camera bump and making the device more comfortable to hold. It’s like a sandwich, but for your phone. High-end smartphones have gotten so close to one another in recent years from a hardware perspective, that comparing them is like splitting hairs that have already been split. Most feature gorgeous QHD displays that are a joy to look at, and the Z is no different. It’s 5.5-inch 1440P screen comes with a ppi of 535 and looks fantastic no matter the situation. The vibrant colors of Rayman Adventures pop, YouTube videos look as crispy as they ought to and photos are rendered beautifully. If you were to nitpick, Motorola’s latest wouldn’t stand up to the best display on the market, which many give to the latest Galaxy phones, but if you’re none the wiser the display will satisfy wholly. The 5.5-inch size feels more demure than it is, thanks to the phone’s waistline obsession, but not every aspect of the device handles its size well. The biggest culprit are the array of buttons, which sit far too high on the phone’s right hand side. For someone with smaller hands, it was an annoyance to stretch my thumb to reach them and, furthering the frustration, Motorola opted to separate the volume up and down buttons rather than utilize a rocker. Because all three buttons are the same size and sit incredibly high on the frame, it was easy to confuse them. Luckily, I didn’t have to use the buttons much thanks to the Moto Z’s fingerprint scanner. While I dislike the square shape, which doesn’t fit the rest of the phone’s sleek aesthetic, the scanner performs incredibly well. Easily outpacing the reader on my Nexus 6P, it’s accurate and blazingly fast. It is just a fingerprint scanner, though, not a home button of any sort. This has driven several other reviewers mad, but I was able to quickly compartmentalize that the on-screen home button was the only home button because the fingerprint scanner became my de facto locking method. A small, but handy, feature lets users lock the phone with the fingerprint reader, something I now wish all companies would implement. Given the hand acrobatics necessary for me to use the actual lock button, I usually defaulted to using the scanner. Hit the Road, Jack The biggest losers to the Moto Z’s starring role on The Biggest Loser are audioheads. The Z is one of the first phones to ditch the headphone jack, a move that is grossly premature and reminds me of Samsung’s original Galaxy Gear, which the company dumped upon the world months before the Apple Watch was released merely to be first out of the gates. In Samsung’s case, the subpar wearable led to far more clever, and genuinely impressive hardware. That’s a best case scenario with this phone, but if Cupertino does kill the headphone jack, you can be assured the Z’s successor won’t backslide. I fully expected to be enraged by the lack of a headphone jack, only to find that I am the perfect user for a phone without one. I often work from home and thus listen to music through my computer or connect my phone to a Bluetooth speaker. When I do commute, it’s on foot to a destination only 15 minutes away, not nearly enough time to dig into music or a podcast. If I do listen to music on a walk or during a workout, I have Bluetooth headphones I can use. I didn’t miss the headphone jack. Not for a single second. But just because the Moto Z’s lack of a 3.5mm input was fine for me doesn’t mean Motorola and Lenovo are just in removing it. In the 21st century, smartphones have become extensions of our bodies; limbs made of Gorilla Glass. The idea of one without the ability to easily play music through headphones you already own is unthinkable, and more than enough reason to pass it by. Motorola attempts to ease those with concerns by putting a USB-C to headphone jack dongle in the box. It works, but also makes you feel like the silliest goober in the world. The truth is that, without a new standard in place, it was too early to remove the headphone jack. This isn’t Apple killing the floppy disk, this is Motorola trying to cut the lunch line. As stated above, the most interesting aspect of the Moto Z is not the thinness of its body, but what you can attach to its back. Like the LG G5, the “modularity” here is surface-level, at best. Sadly, I wasn’t able to try any of the Moto Mods first hand, beyond the Style Shell, but the system is not hard to grasp and that’s the beauty of it. Mods snap onto the back of the phone with the help of strong magnets and the gold 16-pin connector. There’s no need to reboot the phone, and there’s clever software at work that makes the device recognize Mods as an extension of itself rather than an accessory. It’s the best swing at a modular phone yet, but the whole concept still has issues. Mods are not cheap, adding $60-300 on top of a device that is already $624, or $720 for the Z Force. There’s also no guarantee third-party manufacturers will buy into the ecosystem, though there is more support for Motorola’s implementation at the outset than what LG had. At this point, modular smartphones still feel like the fad of 2016, but Motorola’s idea has some legs. If the company pushes it, and can get well-respected manufacturers to build Mods, it could define the company’s flagship devices for years. That’s the meat of the story for the Moto Z. It’s really thin, and has funky accessories that snap onto the back. It’s completely different than the Moto X, but also approaches the smartphone market with a similar sense of individuality. The Z is more in tune with the gimmick of the era, but does it in a way that feels legitimate and clever, like Motorola has done for decades.

Based on screenshots obtained by Android Police, Allo will give users the option to select a message and permanently delete it from the chat’s history. This functionality has been seen in other chat apps in the past such as Slack, and it really proves useful when you spell something wrong or say something that you probably shouldn’t have. Unfortunately, that’s not how deleting a message works on Allo. Deleting a message will make it disappear on your device, but the recipient will still see it. The only way to delete a message completely is to delete it before it has been delivered on the recipient’s device. The screenshots also reveal that you’ll be able to share a message, forward it to another chat, and copy the message’s contents. You’ll also be able to perform these same actions, including deletion, on messages you’ve received. This slideshow requires JavaScript. Along with this, Android Police has also received screenshots showing off various stickers from Allo, and they’re pretty hilarious. A few packs are pre-loaded and more are available to add on later. All of these packs include about 24 different stickers which are each custom designed. You’ll be able to see the first 24 packs, which are apparently pre-loaded with Allo, in the gallery below, but be warned that some are NSFW. Oh, and don’t forget that many of these are animated, only adding to the fun. This slideshow requires JavaScript. Things could, of course, change before Allo’s official release. I’d assume that some of these sticker packs might not be pre-loaded in the final release, for obvious reasons. It’s still unclear when Allo will release, but seeing that Duo is already out, it’s probably not too far off. Guides Android Breaking news for Android.

Chrome apps, like Hangouts and Google Keep, were launched three years ago due to the web lacking offline capabilities, notifications, and connecting to hardware. With the open web now having enough of those features, Google is beginning the “evolution away from the Chrome apps platforms.” These changes only apply to the Chrome browser on Mac, Windows, and Linux. According to Google, packaged and hosted Chrome apps will continue functioning on Chromebooks for the foreseeable future. New features to the Chrome apps platform will apply only to Chrome OS devices, with developers still being able to build for that platform. Google notes that only 1% of those on Windows, Mac, and Linux actually use Chrome packaged apps. In late 2016, newly-published Chrome apps will only be available to Chrome OS users. Existing Chrome apps will continue to work on all platforms. However, by the second half of 2017, the Chrome Web Store will only show extensions and themes for Mac, Windows, and Linux users. In early 2018, those platforms will no longer be able to load Chrome apps. Developers are encouraged to migrate their Chrome apps to the web, while Google encourages devs to help them prioritize which APIs are still needed. Overall, this transition period should be long enough for most users to find suitable replacements for their favorite apps.

Google Chrome supports web browser extensions and so-called Chrome apps. Google launched Chrome apps three years ago to deliver experiences the Web could not provide. Chrome Apps for the most part started out as simple bookmarks that would bring users to web services. The apps evolved later on and some made use of functionality such as offline access or other features eventually. Web standards evolved since the introduction of Chrome apps support in Chrome and Chrome OS, with web technologies becoming more powerful in the process. Google to retire Chrome Apps Google looked at Chrome apps, and how many users of Chrome on Windows, Mac and Linux were used packaged apps actively. According to Google, about 1% of desktop Chrome users make use of Chrome packaged apps. Taking this and the improvements in web standards into account, the company made the decision to retire packaged and hosted apps from all desktop Chrome versions over the next two years. Today, approximately 1% of users on Windows, Mac and Linux actively use Chrome packaged apps, and most hosted apps are already implemented as regular web apps. We will be removing support for packaged and hosted apps from Chrome on Windows, Mac, and Linux over the next two years Chrome apps will remain supported on Chrome OS however for the "foreseeable future". Google did not go into details, and it is unclear for how long Chrome OS will keep on supporting these apps. All types of Chrome apps will remain supported and maintained on Chrome OS for the foreseeable future. Additional enhancements to the Chrome apps platform will apply only to Chrome OS devices, including kiosks. Developers can continue to build Chrome apps (or Android apps) for Chrome OS. The following schedule is used to retire Chrome apps for all desktop platforms: Late 2016: New Chrome apps will only be available to users on Chrome OS. Existing Chrome apps remain accessible, and developers may continue to update them. Second half of 2017: Chrome apps are not longer displayed when users open the Chrome Web Store on Windows, Mac or Linux versions of Chrome. Extensions and themes remain visible in the web store. Early 2018: Users on Windows, Mac or Linux devices may no longer load Chrome apps. Google encourages developers to migrate Chrome apps to the Web. The company suggests that developers who cannot migrate their apps to the web fully help Google prioritize new APIs to "fill the gaps left by Chrome apps". Now You: Do you use Chrome apps actively?

Reply Savior Jenkins August 20, 2016 at 1:02 am # This is more of a sign that Google is getting serious about killing Microsoft DOS with FusionOS, then an isolated spring cleaning. Windows needs to die. Specially as they are getting more aggressive with their shovelware. A lot of people don't seem to have a choice between Windows and... nothing else. Alphabet, please save us, we are on your side. Reply Mark Stahler August 20, 2016 at 1:19 am # I cant believe there are people that used this and even more so that people developed programs for this in the first place. Reply Nebulus August 20, 2016 at 1:50 am # I didn't use Chrome Apps, but I know how it feels when something you use is retired and you have nothing to say or do about it... Reply UnBloatBrowser August 20, 2016 at 2:07 am # Good..... It will lessen the bloat on the browser since its most likely only a small insignificant amount use it anyway. Reply ithehappy August 20, 2016 at 5:37 am # Well, that have to be happened eventually. Google is well known for dropping support of google reader. That's why I don't rely too much in google ecosystem. I bet their new apps Allo and Duo will face the same fate! Reply Koko August 20, 2016 at 7:56 am # No more ad block???? I'll go to Mozilla.... Bye-bye chrome.... Reply Martin Brinkmann August 20, 2016 at 8:15 am # Apps are not extensions. Google won't touch extensions. Reply sartic August 20, 2016 at 8:12 am # so next step is kill google chrome for windows. Love it! ;) Reply Rott Weiller August 20, 2016 at 11:00 am # chrome apps = google os apps as far as i know, so think twice before buying a new chromebook as you may find yourself using chrome and chrome only because of retiring all apps :( ps. not using that idiotic laptops, and always removing the apps from chrome - so no problem on my side Reply RPWheeler August 20, 2016 at 12:38 pm # I do not use actively neither Chrome, nor Chrome apps. I use Chrome for some web apps where Javascript performance matters a lot, but for apps I prefer something browser-independent, also I prefer to have browser one-click restart capability, which Chrome does not have. Reply Heimen Stoffels August 21, 2016 at 1:09 pm # There's Chrome extensions for one-click restart. Reply Dave August 20, 2016 at 1:55 pm # Is there any reason a Chromium fork can't support Chrome apps and even update the feature via the Chrome OS updates? Reply Heimen Stoffels August 21, 2016 at 1:12 pm # You can't install a different browser or core OS feature on ChromeOS so it can't be distributed via the updates. A fork for other platforms could support Chrome apps but the apps are going to be removed from the Chrome Web Store next year so there's no way to install them. Unless said fork creates an extensions website (or section, in case they already have an extensions website) with a Chrome apps section. But then devs need to migrate their apps from the Chrome Web Store to said new website.

Fossil Q Wander Smartwatch Has Appealing Features, Traditional Flair The Fossil Q Wander may look like a traditional watch, but it's an Android Wear-based smartwatch that works with both iOS and Android mobile devices. It Fits Into the Fossil Watch Design Tradition Fossil hasn't strayed from its roots with the Q Wander's design. The device has a round face and looks nearly identical to some of its traditional watches. Users also will find Fossil's own wristbands and a dial on the side. Absent a closer look, one might be fooled into believing the Q Wander is a traditional watch. It's Powered by Android Wear Google's Android Wear powers the Q Wander, giving users full access to the operating system's slate of features, including support for countless watch faces, alerts to texts and much more. Android Wear generally has been well-received in the marketplace, which makes Fossil's decision to go with the operating system a smart one. Q Wander Works Across Platforms The Q Wander won't only work with Android-based devices. In fact, Fossil said the smartwatch will notify users of calls, texts and other notifications on iPhone 5 or newer iPhones running iOS 8 or up. On the Android side, the device requires Android 4.3 or higher. The Battery Will Last All Day Fossil has promised somewhat solid battery life in the Q Wander, saying it will last for 24 hours on a single charge before it needs to be powered up. That's only an estimate, though, and Fossil was quick to note that heavier usage could drain the battery more quickly. Either way, expect to charge the Q Wander at night. There Are Plenty of Activity Tracking Features In addition to telling time, the Q Wander is a fitness tracker that comes bundled with several sensors that can track a person's steps, distance traveled and calories burned. Despite that, surprisingly the smartwatch doesn't come with a heart rate sensor for tracking a person's pulse. Find Built-In Wireless Connectivity The Fossil Q Wander comes with WiFi built-in. With WiFi connectivity, users can control apps such as Apple Music or Spotify directly from the watch face. In addition, users don't always need to have their smartphones in their pockets to get notifications. WiFi integration in smartwatches has nearly become a requirement in today's mobile marketplace, and it's nice to see it in the Q Wander. Getting a Sense of the Fossil Q Wander's Size With so many shapes and variations available, a smartwatch's size should be considered before making a purchase. The Q Wander has a case size of 45mm and features support for all types of 22mm straps. To put that into perspective, the popular LG Watch Urbane has a 46mm face with a 22mm band, making them nearly identical in size. It Supports Wireless Data Synchronization and Charging Fossil's Q Wander is all about going wireless. In addition to WiFi networking, the device comes with wireless synchronization, allowing users to transfer data over Bluetooth between smartphone and smartwatch. The smartwatch ships with a conductive magnetic charger, which means that it supports wireless charging. Pick From Several Watchband Options Thanks to an "interchangeable design," the Q Wander is compatible with any 22mm strap, Fossil says. The company is currently selling four Q Wander variants, starting with a sports-friendly black silicone strap, along with a light brown leather strap. Customers also can choose a stainless steel wristband or a rose gold-tone stainless bracelet. Preorder Now and Get It Later As of this writing, the Fossil Q Wander is available for preorder through the Fossil website. The device is slated to ship on Aug. 29. When it does, customers will find the leather, silicone and stainless-steel versions all cost $295. The rose gold-tone stainless version will be priced at $315.

The Apple Watch is the most popular smartwatch in the world, while Google is the creator of Android Wear, a mobile operating system that runs on an increasing number of wearable computers. Traditional watchmakers, meanwhile, view the smartwatch market as new, desirable territory for them. These watchmakers often rely on Android Wear to bring new smartwatch designs to the market, and the Fossil Q Wander is one of the latest smartwatches to fit that mold. The device, which comes with a round face, runs on Android Wear and delivers several appealing features, including Bluetooth support, wireless charging, and the ability to work with both iOS and Android mobile devices. It's also an attractive smartwatch that won't break the bank with its $295 starting price. This slide show discusses the Fossil Q Wander's key features and why the device, which is scheduled to go on sale at the end of August, could be a nice option for people looking for a smartwatch that reflects a more traditional watch design heritage.                       Submit a Comment Loading Comments...   Manage your Newsletters: Login   Register My Newsletters eWeek Editor's Pick News & Views Cloud Computing Mobile and Wireless Update Best of eWeek eWeek Sunday Brunch eCareers Smart Moves Enterprise Applications Topic Center Update Enterprise IT Advantage eWeek Whitepaper Spotlight eWeek Labs eWeek Enterprise Update eWeek Storage Report Industry Center Update : Finance Industry Center Update : Government Industry Center Update : Health Care Infrastructure Topic Center Update Linux & Open Source Topic Center Update Mid-Market Solutions Securing the Enterprise VoIP Topic Center Update What's Hot Now eWeekend                             Topics by Type Android Apple Cloud Database Developer Enterprise Apps Innovation IT Management   Mobile Networking PC Hardware Security Servers Small Business Storage Virtualization Articles by Type News & Analysis Slideshows Blogs Reviews Video   Contact Us About eWeek Sitemap Blogs Security Watch Upfront First Read Storage Station Careers Google Watch Special Features eWeekChat eWeek 30th Anniversary Cloud Backup Project Center Next Generation Firewall Project Center Big Data Analytics Project Center Research Center       Property of QuinStreet Enterprise.

  Home U.K. News Sports U.S. Showbiz Australia Femail Health Science Money Video Travel Columnists Wires Home My Profile Logout Login Feedback DailyMail NEW ARTICLESHomeTop Share show ad AT&T, Apple, Google to work on 'robocall' crackdown By Reuters Published: 16:06 EST, 19 August 2016 | Updated: 16:06 EST, 19 August 2016 e-mail By David Shepardson WASHINGTON, Aug 19 (Reuters) - More than 30 major technology and communication companies said on Friday they are joining the U.S. government to crack down on "robocalls," automated, prerecorded phone calls that regulators have labeled a "scourge." AT&T Inc, Google parent Alphabet Inc, Apple Inc, Verizon Communications Inc and Comcast Corp are among members of the "Robocall Strike Force" that held its first meeting with the U.S. Federal Communications Commission. The strike force will report to the FCC by Oct. 19 on "concrete plans to accelerate the development and adoption of new tools and solutions," said AT&T Chief Executive Officer Randall Stephenson, chairman of the group. The strike force hopes to implement Caller ID verification standards to help block calls from spoofed phone numbers and consider a "Do Not Originate" list that would block spoofers from impersonating legitimate phone numbers from governments, banks or others. FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler in July urged major companies to take new action to block robocalls, which often come from telemarketers or scam artists. "This scourge must stop," Wheeler said on Friday, calling robocalls the No. 1 complaint from consumers. "The bad guys are beating the good guys with technology," Wheeler said. In the past, he has said robocalls continue "due in large part to industry inaction." Stephenson emphasized "the breadth and complexity" of the problem. "This is going to require more than individual company initiatives and one-off blocking apps," Stephenson said. "Robocallers are a formidable adversary, notoriously hard to stop." The FCC does not require robocall blocking and filtering but has strongly encouraged phone service providers to offer those services at no charge. The strike force brings together carriers, device makers, operating system developers, network designers and the government. "We have to come out of this with a comprehensive play book for all of us to go execute," Stephenson said. "We have calls that are perfectly legal, but unwanted, like telemarketers and public opinion surveyors. At the other end of the spectrum, we have millions of calls that are blatantly illegal." Stephenson said technical experts representing the companies have had "preliminary conversations about short- and longer-term initiatives." Joan Marsh, AT&T vice president of federal regulatory issues, called the problem complicated. "We have been wrangling with this problem long enough to know there is no silver bullet," she said. "Nothing by itself is going to do it." Other companies taking part include Blackberry Ltd, British Telecommunications Plc, Charter Communications Inc, Frontier Communications, LG Electronics Inc, Microsoft Corp, Nokia Corp , Qualcomm Inc, Samsung Electronics Co Ltd , Sirius XM Holdings Inc, T-Mobile US Inc and U.S. Cellular Corp. Consumers Union, a public advocacy group, said the task force is a sign "phone companies are taking more serious steps to protect their customers from unwanted calls."

Roston - Aug 19, 2016 1 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit If you’re a Windows, Mac or Linux user, the odds are really, really low that you’re also a Chrome apps user. According Google, only about one percent of the users on those platforms are ‘actively’ utilizing packaged Chrome apps, and so as you probably guessed, there’s not much sense in continuing support for them. For this reason, Google has decided that all new Chrome apps published starting later this year will only be available on Chrome OS; support for existing apps for Mac, Windows and Linux will be phased out over the next couple of years. Chrome apps launched three years ago, and while they’re okay for Chromebooks, there’s not much of a point to them on Windows and Mac devices. Google says it is time to evolve away from the Chrome apps platform, though, and that means shedding its dead weight: all the Linux, Windows, and Mac users who aren’t using the apps. Over the next two years, support for both hosted apps and packaged apps from Chrome will be nixed. More immediately, though, will be the inaccessibility of new Chrome apps for these users — sometime later this year (on an unspecified date), all Chrome apps published on and after that date won’t be available to Windows, Mac and Linux users. You will be able to get and use them if you have a Chromebook, though. Some time in the second half of 2017, Windows, Mac and Linux users will no longer see Chrome apps in the Chrome Web Stores, instead only having access to the themes and extensions. Finally, in the early part of 2018, the trio of platforms will not be able to load any Chrome apps, marking the final end to a long process.

Resend activation e-mail Gear & Gadgets / Product News & Reviews Google is killing Chrome apps on Windows, Mac, and Linux Chrome OS will remain supported "for the foreseeable future." by Andrew Cunningham - Aug 19, 2016 7:55 pm UTC Login to bookmark 147 Enlarge / Chrome apps running on an older version of Chrome OS. Andrew Cunningham Chrome OS has become a low-key success story for Google in the last few years. Because they're relatively cheap and easy to track and manage, Chromebooks has made inroads in businesses and educational institutions. But Chrome OS still has a big shortcoming compared to Windows and macOS: an app gap. To help close that gap and augment Web apps, Google introduced the Chrome apps platform to let developers make Web apps that looked and functioned more like traditional standalone apps. Part of Google's sales pitch was that Chrome apps were universal—without any additional effort from developers, these apps would run not just on Chrome OS, but also any Windows, Mac, or Linux PC with Chrome installed. The Chrome apps platform was an interesting experiment, but it has apparently failed. In a blog post today, Google said that "approximately 1 percent" of all Chrome users on Windows, Mac, and Linux were using Chrome apps. Arguing that Web standards have continued to evolve and become more capable and that the company is simplifying Chrome, Google says that support for Chrome apps on non-Chrome OS platforms will be phased out over the next two years. Extensions and themes will remain available on all platforms. Later this year, any new Chrome apps that are published will only be available to Chrome OS users, though existing apps can continue to be updated. "In the second half of 2017," Windows, Mac, and Linux users won't be able to see Chrome apps in the Chrome Web Store. And "in early 2018," non-Chrome OS platforms will lose the ability to load Chrome apps altogether. The company says that Chrome apps will remain supported and maintained on Chrome OS "for the foreseeable future." Google will even continue to work on and improve the Chrome apps platform for Chrome OS devices. But given that Android apps are coming to Chrome OS and that Chrome apps are being killed on every other platform, their future doesn't look bright.

Advertisement NEXT:Grey New York, Volvo and Walt Whitman Take to the Open Road PREVIOUS:Barkley, Russell Athletic Want to Inspire You to 'Settle Your Score' Campaigns | What The?? Did Google Rip Off This Viral Japanese Ad from 2015? By Patrick Coffee on Aug. 19, 2016 - 3:29 PMComment It’s time for another round of “Is It Plagiariasm, Or…?” Earlier this week, an anonymous tipster sent us this 2015 ad for Japanese internet service provider Plala. It’s a nicely done piece, and it’s unlike many American ads in that you have to wait a minute for the payoff. OK, that was pretty cool. The ad went viral in Japan, and it was also briefly referenced in a more than slightly insane ramen spot that went up last week. Fast forward to earlier this month, when Google debuted a new spot promoting its “Free Up Space” service, which was created to avoid the very sort of problems encountered by the school girls in the ad above. It depicts a bunch of situations that are conceptually identical to the one in the Plala ad but executed in a far more rapid way. The style is different but the hook is the same — and it’s not one we’d seen before. (It’s not clear whether this one was by an outside shop or Google’s in-house team, but a lack of attribution points to the latter.) Our tipster wrote earlier this week: “Don’t let Google get away with plagiarizing someone else’s creative work. For what its worth, I’m a firm believer that there’s a certain level of ethics that should be followed when producing creative. This includes not stealing others’ work. And in this situation, with complete disregard for these ethics Google directly lifted another brand’s creative work to pass as their own. Can they not afford to produce original creative? Or are they just LAZY?” We feel like he has a point, even if we’ve seen more blatant ripoffs during our tenure at this here web site. Maybe a good thing that the bodybuilding guy in the Google spot didn’t finish his video, though. He seemed destined to experience a very painful fall.

AdSense network, but Google's protections should be keeping users safe. New research from Kaspersky Lab identified a variant of the Svpeng mobile banking Trojan being delivered to Android devices without any user interaction necessary. Mikhail Kuzin and Nikita Buchka, malware analysts for Kaspersky Lab, based in Moscow, described the finding in a blog post. "There you are, minding your own business, reading the news and BOOM! -- no additional clicks or following links required. It turns out the malicious program is downloaded via the Google AdSense advertising network ... anyone can register their ad on this network -- they just need to pay a fee. And it seems that didn't deter the authors of the Svpeng Trojan from pushing their creation via AdSense. The Trojan is downloaded as soon as a page with the advert is visited." The Svpeng banking Trojan was first discovered in mid-2014. Kuzin and Buchka wrote it "can steal information about the user's bank cards via phishing windows, [as well as] intercept, delete and send text messages," and it "collects an impressive amount of information from the user's phone -- the call history, text and multimedia messages, browser bookmarks and contacts." Although the Trojan app is silently delivered to Android devices, it cannot perform any of these functions without being installed. This means a user would have to find the downloaded app, install it, turn off Android's standard protections against installing apps from unknown sources, and finally bypass Google's Verify Apps protections, which warn users when they are potentially installing malware. Buchka described the deception techniques, but said Google's Android security measures have started blocking the AdSense malware. "The malicious .apk was downloading without [a] user's actions. But the user had to give the permission on the installation. Fraudsters were using file names such as 'last-browser-update' [and] 'important-browser-update' to deceive the unsuspecting user and force him to install malicious .apk. The duped user allowed installation, thinking that it was a critical update," Buchka told SearchSecurity. "At the time of research, Google's Verify Apps protections [were] not detecting this application as potentially dangerous, but now Google's protection stops it."                                                                                        Next Steps Learn more about the results of Google's second Android Security Report.

Google’s Allo Lets Users Delete Messages from Chat History Allo is expected to be released pretty soon Aug 19, 2016 19:23 GMT  ·  By Alexandra Vaidos  ·  Share:  Just a few days ago, Google released its video calling app Duo, which has already become the number 1 free app in the Play Store. However, during this year’s Google I/O, the company also announced a new messaging application, Allo. Allo is expected to be released soon, as information on the app continues to surface online, with the latest showing that the application will be coming with a feature that allows users to delete messages from their chat history. Users will be able to select the message and simply delete it from the chat. Android Police reports that the multiple select feature isn’t available just yet, but it could be provided later, considering that it has appeared in the beta testing phase of the app. It seems that the top bar of the app can switch to display share, forward, copy and delete options for a selected message. Sent and received messages can be deleted with ease. The messages are removed from the device and account, but they’re still left on the recipient’s phone. Another neat feature is that the application will offer to delete media contained in messages from the phone’s storage, not just the application. Messages sent through Allo can contain photos, videos, and even audio files. The new feature resembles the tools that WhatsApp offers, but the delete option isn’t found in Google’s Hangouts app. Google has also recently stated that Hangouts will start focusing on enterprise users.   CHECK OUT THE GALLERY  (4 Images) #Google#Allo#Duo#Google I/O#Hangouts reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Allo comes with delete options (4 Images) 01 02 03 04 Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Google Duo Becomes the Most Popular Free App in the Play Store Google to Add Audio Calls Support in Duo Google App V6.2 Beta Reveals Details About Google Assistant Google’s Allo and Duo Apps Get New Icons in the Play Store iPhone 8 to Feature Traditional Wireless Charging like the Samsung Galaxy S7 Lenovo Builds a New Microsoft Surface Clone and It Looks Fabulous Anonymous Hackers Want McAfee to Be Trump’s Security Adviser, Call for March Hackers Could Infect Headphones to Spy on You The LG V20 Has Been Successfully Rooted Galaxy S6 and S7 Owners Complain About Samsung’s Stock Email App Facebook Is Testing a New Snapchat-like Camera Feature Google Adds Stranger Things Stickers to Allo, New Themes to Arrive Soon 4 photos    Allo comes with the option to delete messages New Android APKs VivaVideo APK: Updated November 23rd, 14:19 GMT PowerDirector APK: Updated November 23rd, 14:08 GMT WeVideo APK: Updated November 23rd, 14:04 GMT Amazon Rapids APK: Updated November 23rd, 14:02 GMT ActionDirector APK: Updated November 23rd, 13:58 GMT DataEye APK: Updated November 23rd, 13:46 GMT JOOX APK: Updated November 23rd, 13:46 GMT Reader comments Load old comments   Here Is How Nokia Will Release Android Smartphones in 2017 more on: Nokia smartphones i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2016 Softpedia.

Resend activation e-mail Law & Disorder / Civilization & Discontents Anti-Google research group in Washington is funded by Oracle At least 17 news articles have cited research by the "nonprofit watchdog group." by Joe Mullin - Aug 19, 2016 7:28 pm UTC Login to bookmark The Google Transparency Project is a Washington, DC group that's laser-focused on letting Americans know about Google's lobbying efforts. To get its message out, GTP has worked with journalists at Re/Code and The Intercept, which have run stories about Google's many visits to the White House, the prevalence of ex-Googlers in the US Digital Service, and other links. What wasn't known, until today, is who was paying the bills for research by the "nonprofit watchdog" group. "The folks running the Google Transparency Project won’t say who is paying for it, which is odd for a group devoted to transparency," noted Fortune's Jeff John Roberts, one of many journalists who the group reached out to in April. Today, Roberts has published a followup, confirming that based on a tip, he found at least one funder—Oracle. That's the same company that lost a major copyright trial to Google and continues to spar with the search giant in court. “Oracle is absolutely a contributor (one of many) to the Transparency Project. This is important information for the public to know. It is 100 percent public records and accurate,” Oracle Senior VP Ken Glueck told Roberts. Other funders remain unknown. One big suspect, however, can be ruled out. Microsoft, whose lobbyists and lawyers have clashed with Google on many occasions, told Roberts that it is not part of the group. Is it a big deal? We're better off with the information being out there. Like Roberts, I agree that "throwing light on lobbying conducted by Google (or any other big company) is a good thing." However, it also seems like the source of the information should be made clear, especially for a group that's so focused on investigations against a particular company. GTP's research has led to a lot of news stories—many of them around the time of this year's Oracle v. Google trial—none of which reported that the Oracle is paying, at least in part, for the Google investigations. The Google Transparency Project is part of a larger organization called the Campaign for Accountability, an organization that says its goal is to use "research, litigation, and aggressive communications to expose how decisions made behind the doors of corporate boardrooms and government offices impact Americans' lives." It also works on issues like anti-LGBT discrimination and environmental protection. Expand full story Reader comments You must login or create an account to comment.

M&F Editors  Advertisement The creatives at Google are always finding innovative ways to educate, inspire, and entertain via their Google Doodles. And today's "strong" showing is just another example, except they clearly didn't have anyone watching this dude's form. "That is a unique move: a hybrid stiff-leg deadlift-barbell row-reverse curl-push press," says M&F Deputy Editor Zack Zeigler. "Also, he has clearly skipped a few hundred leg days, but he gets a pass. Namely because he has bigger issues to contend with, like the fact that he is missing both feet. Maybe he should hold off on the upper-body moves until he A) puts on shorts (we can see your stem, sir), and B) adds muscle to those stilts he calls legs." Google ran the weightlifting Raspberry in an effort to promote the 11th day of the 2016 Doodle Fruit Games, where (hopefully organic!) produce from all over the market compete for the title freshest fruit, and players are flocking to get in on all the action. In today's main event we see the mighty, headband-wearing Raspberry warming up for the weightlifting competition. "That headband clearly needs an upgrade, but that unibrow is top-notch," adds Zack. "Also, this is for any guy, girl, or piece of produce who enters a gym: Flexing your face muscle pre- or post-lift is never advised in the fruit-lifting world." Yes, we know we're being tough on Raspberry, but we're not wrong: owning gigantic balloon-sized biceps and toothpick legs is a rotten look. However, by the time you finish reading this paragraph, the Raspberry will have knocked out 12 reps with no sign of slowing.

Students at Timrod Elementary School in Florence open a package containing the most recent piece of classroom furniture funded through DonorsChoose.org. Thirteen classroom stools have been added to the school’s computer lab. Melissa Rollins Morning News i By Melissa Rollins Florence Morning News LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story FLORENCE In modern classrooms, books and pencils are not the only things that teachers use to reach their students. However, with small budgets and limited resources anything outside of the essentials often comes out of a teacher’s pockets or doesn’t materialize at all. Websites like DonorChoose.org let teachers crowdfund their educational needs; strangers, other teachers and local community members can contribute as little or as much as they want. In Florence School District One, several teachers have had success getting their projects funded. With the start of a new school year, hundreds of active campaigns are just waiting to be supported. Timrod Elementary School Computer Lab teacher Toni Allen has had several campaigns funded through the website. She currently has two campaigns, one for Google Cardboard and one for headphones for the computer lab. “I found out about the website the year that I was teacher of the year -- that was 2013-2014,” Allen said. “I helped put together the district’s slideshow and found out that all of these teachers were getting grants through DonorsChoose and I had no idea what that was. After the district banquet, I went online to check it out. I did two and was funded within a week.” Most of the campaigns Allen has had completed were for Hokki Stools for her lab. “I have a lot of students that lean really far forward in their chairs or lean their chairs back and I was always telling them to put them down,” Allen said. “This way, they can move around and wiggle and I don’t have to tell them to stop.” Throughout the course of several campaigns, Allen has gotten 13 Hokki Stools. She currently has live campaigns for new headphones and one for Google Cardboard; the one for headphones has yet to get any funding. “It ends at the end of the month and I’m not sure it’s going to be funded,” Allen said. “Sometimes our headphones work and sometimes they don’t.” Google Cardboard use virtual reality to take people to places around the world. “I have seen Google Cardboard at several conferences and it is just awesome,” Allen said. “At one conference we did Antarctica and the rainforest. You can look and see what the ground looks like, what the sky looks like. We got to stand at the Grand Canyon and just see what was around. It seems like it would fit our kids really good because they can’t always go to those places.” Patty Ward, kindergarten teacher at Carver Elementary School, said she would encourage all teachers to use DonorsChoose. “The only way teachers can afford to get extra things for their classrooms is through DonorsChoose,” Ward said. “I’ve gotten stamps for a literacy center. I’ve gotten dominoes. I’ve gotten pattern blocks. I just got an easel from a project that was funded. I can’t afford all of this stuff myself; I wish there was a way that the district could provide a workshop on it. We are really blessed in Florence One because some districts don’t allow teachers to use it.” Ward said that getting started is easy. “You go in, put your name, your email address, what school you’re at, how many children you have and stuff like that,” Ward said. “It takes like five minutes to set up an account. You tell about what you are asking for and it would benefit your students. A lot of the donations are just a dollar; other times it is way more than a dollar. Every little bit helps.” Though it can be disappointing when a campaign doesn’t get funded, Ward said the key is to keep trying. “You don’t know until you try,” Ward said. “Teachers need to learn how to ask for help; people really do want to help. I highly recommend that teachers use DonorsChoose. Unfortunately, if their first one isn’t funded, a lot don’t ever do it again.” Some donations come completely from individuals, while other campaigns are chosen to have matching grants from foundations like the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. In one case, Ward said, her request was filled in an unorthodox way. “One time I was asking for math manipulatives,” Ward said. “A teacher in New Jersey who had just retired saw my request and sent me a box full of them.” After contributing to a campaign, donors receive a thank-you note from the teacher and often the students that will be affected.

But hey, this is my blog, my game board, and I get to do what I want. My older sister and I have always been a bit competitive in playing games. Harriet and I go head to head with each other in Words with Friends, she often trouncing me, and sometimes, I her. I have this memory which she may dispute. That’s the thing with memory, we have out versions imprinted as truth, fact in our brains, but often it the story varies with whomever tells it. She was often more victorious than I in Monopoly, but one time I was getting all the breaks- the quick monopolies, hotels on Boardwalk/Park Place, getting the piles of cash from Free Parking, heck I bet I won the second prize in a beauty contest Chance card. I have a visual memory of her saying she was bored, yawning, hands stretching under the edge of the board, and just flipping the game board up in the air. I bet I cried and went to “tell” someone. Today Google owns a big game board on the internet where we put our effort, building, hoping for good draws of cards. But it’s totally their board. And who knows if it’s boredom, but they seem to get bored too, and just flip our little plastic buildings and fake deeds in the air. Need I mention Google Reader? Buzz. Answers. Orkut. Wave (well that was a good choice). Lot’s more. But it’s their board, they can do what they like. A year ago they decided to stop allowing web content to be hosted in Google Drive. Usual reasons. Other options are out there. They want to focus their energies elsewhere. This has an effect on those of us using Martin Hawksey’s genius script for an auto updated twitter archive. But in that case they gave a full year’s notice (Martin has a short term fix and is working on a long term one, someone knight that fella). Earlier this week (well that’ when I heard about it), the owner of the Googopoly game announced something that has a big impact for many of my projects (soon for the UDG Agora project), and others like Virtually Connecting, and many other educators who use Google Hangout. In one month (September 12) they were changing the way hangouts were run, moving them from Google+ (soon to be on that Wikipedia List of discontinued services, I bet) to YouTube. The reason was not clear. But the news was quickly pushed out from The Verge Google is killing off Hangouts on Air in September (totally misleading baited headline IMHO), ZDnet, 9to5 Google and probably another 100 “news stories” I could Google. The thing is– all of this rush to public stories are the same, they just re-wrote stuff that appears in the Google “announcement”. I must admit a bit of sky is falling reaction first, I usually try to avoid that. via GIPHY And I was in at least two Slack channels where people were WTF-ing, scrambling to find info. I am sure it was repeated elsewhere. They new interface for running Hangouts is within YouTube. That kind of makes sense. But they have co-mingled the “advanced” features that video pros like Andy Rush would use. If you are trying to figure things out and are in the area of downloading encoders (like I did), you are in the wrong place. There are stuff for video producers to do more with multiple sources, scenes, etc. People like Ken Bauer jumped in and did some tests and gave me some re-assurance that things were not as sky crashing as I might have thought. Mandy Honeyman shared this video, which explained a lot to me that I needed to know: So pretty much you can still schedule Hangouts, or just run them on one click, from the new YouTube Creators Studio under Live Streaming– or https://www.youtube.com/live_dashboard. The thing to ignore is the links and the blue banner nudges to try the new improved “Stream Now” — those all lead to encoder land. If you end up having to choose encoders, go back. Use Events to do Hangouts as they were. I’ve got things set up (for now) in a way I understand. The one nut, as described in the video above, are the new hoops one has to jump through to have a live video stream embedding in another site. Until now, when you scheduled a Hangout, it provides you the Watch URL, the YouTube URL you send viewers, and that URL also becomes the link for the archive. This works well for our Virtually Connecting events, as we can announce them with a time converted, and in WordPress include the live stream / archive URL by just putting the URL on a blank line (see the most recent event). But now, sigh, to embed a live stream in your blog, you first have to click through screens to accept, and create settings for advertisements. The embed option is still not active. Then you have to go create an account and link your google account to Adsense. Even if you have no plans to run ads, apparently Google does. To activate adsense, you have to provide a mailing address, phone number etc. All of this to be able to embed a live stream. I started down the road to set this up for our UDG Agora project. I followed the idea we do in Virtually Connecting- I created a new Google account, and use the Chrome feature to log in as another user. Because our hangouts will have different hosts, by sharing access to this account, all of our Hangouts will land in the same YouTube Channel. In about 10 minutes of trying to set everything up to get the new embed settings cleared, I had 10 Google tabs open. I stopped. How necessary was the live stream option? So I did a test, I scheduled a hangout (one we are doing for reals) A scheduled hangout in the new YouTube interface There’s a clear button to run the hangout, and later today I will schedule in all 8-10 of our planned events. If you click “Edit”, the Watch Page button in the top right leads to the public URL (the one again where people where watch and where the archive will land). The one for this event is https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRrRZrmoJvM. What I wondered was, while I expected the WordPress autoembed to fail (because I opted out of ads / adsenseless) I was curious if an archive would embed, because at that point, it is just a YouTube video. So I did a 40 second Hangout on Air of my dog sleeping on the deck (it is that exciting around here). So I have one YouTube URL of a scheduled Hangout and one of a past one, and I tested them on a WordPress page As expected, the scheduled link does not embed but a past one does. This says to me I can skip the adsense nonsense, and on event pages, just have a link to the URL before the event, and replace with the URL so it embeds after (I am betting I could write a WordPress plugin with a shortcode that would handle it automatically). Once in a hangout, everything is the same as it was. All the changes are in how you set them up. I learned two useful tricks in the process. If you go to the Live Streaming Dashboard, there is a “Change Thumbnail” buttons- this lets you choose a background image that will show up for live events before the go. I used a photo from a recent event: Don’t have a boring black background for your scheduled events, choose a thumbnail for your account But also, way way down in the bottom right corner, you see a URL box labeled “Share” with social media icons: Now this is super handy. This is one URL you can use to announce how to watch a live stream, no needing to dig out the URL. For Virtually Connecting, if we are running a live stream, it can always be watched at http://www.youtube.com/c/VirtuallyConnecting/live (when done, it is archived at its own URL). This makes announcing events easier, you can even tweet out from that dashboard. I don’t have all the answers, but I do not find them by reading those off the cuff posts on tech sites. Frankly, the way Google intertwines the new complicated stream features with the traditional hangouts is confusing. And that nonsense with needing to sign up for adsense looks like something designed by a committee of engineers. Google has, does, and will continue to flip the board on you. Why? Because they can. No, it’s because you should always keep in mind that despite messages of not doing evil or being committed to education, Google’s prime directive is to make money by selling advertisements. Everything is about serving ads based upon all the information they garner from you. And your image of “The Cloud” might be fluffy stuff of negligible weight, software services in that cloud need large physical infrastucture, rows of boxed servers, electricity, cooling, etc). The cloud has to be paid for. And it is paid for with advertisements, fine tuned by your personal dada. In many cases, I you, everyone else, sacrifices their information in the bargain of getting a service that looks free. But Google never sees you as an individual. They do not see that announcing a change of service in August might affect teachers who have made plans for courses starting now or in a few weeks. They do not see that as a small non profit organization you are too busy trying to do your work on thin budget then to spend time figuring out some new arcane interface. Google only sees you in an aggregate of massive data. You are an averaged sum to them. So it’s useless to speculate why they change/delete things. The answer is easy. If it does not make ad money for them, it will be tossed into the air. Your class, your project, your fan club, you– as an individual — do not matter to them. That’s how we play but really are played, by Googopoly. Top / Featured Image: A mashup of many random Monopoly game parts found on The Google (images search). Most were not openly licensed, and I freely admit taking them to remix into something new and commercially unviable. I am so guilty of theft. But at some point we have to ask about the idea of digital ownership of parts of popular culture used in a manner of open expression.

Lots of tweetable words of wisdom, which i tweeted :) but also lots of useful summing up of tips and puts it all in one place that is easier to find later than searching through the (non) archives of Slack! Was gonna pin them all but this does the trick Stephen Downes August 22, 2016 at 4:56 pm Reply So that’s 41 seconds of my life I’ll never get back. :p Good post, especially the bit telling me I can do a live video under ‘Events’ (who would think to look there?). Though that said after using the video encoder I find it’s a much better video. But Google is really sneaky the way it introduces it. Tom Smith August 25, 2016 at 2:17 am Reply @Stephen Downes – FYI, you don’t get any of it back. Not one minute. Not ever. Get used to it. :-) Hangouts used to be a quirky tool worth teaching people how to use, now I’m struggling myself, and know my colleagues just won’t get them. Yet again, Google have cocked it up royally. Sigh. Organisations are losing patience with Google because tools either wither on the vine of lack of progression and development or just get shafted.

Lots has changed, even its name (it's now called Alphabet). But one thing's for sure: Investors made tons of money on the stock. Shares of Alphabet (then called Google) has seen its shares rise 1,780% since first selling shares to the public in August 2004 at a split-adjusted $42 a share, says Bespoke Investment Group. That trounces the 99% gain by the Standard & Poor's 500 index during the same time period. During its time since its initial public offering, Alphabet has flooded the market with mobile devices running its Android operating system and maintained its near monopoly on Internet search. The company is now valued at $550 billion, making it the second most valuable company in the S&P 500 after Apple (AAPL) at $589 billion. But as remarkable as Google's rise has been, it isn't even the best place that investors could have put their money 12 years ago. It might be surprising, but energy drinks were even more lucrative for investors, as shares of Monster Beverage (MNST) have gained 11,630% since Google went public, Bespoke says. Google hasn't even been the best Internet stock, that distinction instead has gone to name-your-own price travel agent Priceline Group (PCLN), which has jumped 6,986% since Google went public. In fact, Google's stock gains were topped by five tech companies including Priceline such as Netflix (NFLX), Salesforce.com (CRM), Amazon.com (AMZN) and its archrival Apple (AAPL). That's not to belittle Alphabet's remarkable financial success resulting from collecting enormous amounts of data on its users and selling it to advertisers. Since 2004, Alphabet's revenue has soared 2,463.7% to $81.8 billion (as of the past 12 months) and net income has jumped even faster, 4,407%, to $18 billion. Analysts remain enthusiastic about the stock's future. Analysts on average are calling for the stock to be worth $935 a share in 18 months, which would be 17% higher than the Friday's closing price of $799.65.

We rank all 16 Angry Birds games 8 things you need to know about Duo, Google's new video chat app Video Google Daydream View unboxing: A first look at Google's VR headset Been waiting on Google to make a simple, easy-to-use FaceTime competitor? Luckily, Duo is finally here, and the super-streamlined app enables hassle-free video chat between both Android and iOS devices. Duo is this week’s most notable new app release, but it’s not the only one that should be on your radar. Deus Ex Go is the latest console and PC franchise to get the Go treatment after Hitman and Lara Croft, and it’s a slick and smart tactical adaptation. Meanwhile, Mr. Robot arrives on Android with a compelling text adventure, FordVR lets you experience the 24 Hours of Le Mans race via Cardboard, and the entertaining Not Golf is like golf… but not. Snag a few fresh apps for your phone and enjoy the weekend! Google Duo The Knock Knock preview gives you an early glimpse at what’s on the other end of a call. Announced back at I/O alongside messaging app Allo, Google Duo is finally here to bring a FaceTime-like level of simplicity to video chat across both Android and iOS alike. Duo has a dead-simple interface and is tied to your phone number, and you can easily ping a contact for a video call with a tap or two. Also, new feature Knock Knock lets you preview the video feed on the other end, so you can prepare yourself for good or bad news (or dodge the call, as needed). Duo calls are end-to-end encrypted, in case you’re worried about privacy, and Google says its calls work well even on meager data connections. Hangouts hasn’t been a reliably great option for video calls, while Snapchat and Skype can seem comparably complex or overstuffed compared to something like this. Duo’s simplicity and straightforward design could make a standout option in this crowded market, especially thanks to its cross-platform approach.  Deus Ex Go Deus Ex Go scales down the stealth-action experience without losing the glossy sheen. Following in the footsteps of Hitman Go and Lara Croft Go comes Deus Ex Go ($5), another smart adaptation of a beloved console and PC game series. Based on the cyberpunk stealth shooter games, Deus Ex Go translates the premise into a turn-based puzzler, wherein you’ll move robotically-enhanced hero Adam Jensen around game boards to reach the exit. Naturally, the paths are lined with enemies and obstacles, and you’ll need to figure out the best timing and tactics to get through safely.  Keeping with the source material, Deus Ex Go adds a new hacking component to levels that lets you manipulate turrets and walkways, plus it’s the first Go game to actually have a storyline included. Luckily, you don’t need to be a die-hard Deus Ex fan to enjoy this brainy game, and beyond the 50 core levels, it’ll offer a new stage every weekday for some time to come. Mr. Robot:1.51exfiltrati0n.apk You can be a total troll with response options like these. Are you engrossed in USA Network’s hit hacker drama Mr. Robot? Well, now there’s a game that lets you live out some of the shenanigans on the show. Mr. Robot:1.51exfiltrati0n.apk ($3)—and yes, that’s really its Play Store title—is a narrative adventure that takes the form of a chat app from the show’s antagonistic E Corp company. It acts a bit like text-based game Lifeline, in that the story unfolds in little moments throughout your day. The game takes place during the first season of the show, and you play the unlucky soul who happened to find the dropped phone of series character Darlene. She needs the device and its contents to carry out fsociety’s massive hack, so you’ll navigate conversations and choose responses to help shape the storyline ahead. From what I’ve played so far, it seems like a really neat way to go further down the rabbit hole of the show’s ever-twisting narrative. FordVR You won’t be in the driver’s seat, but at least you can be next to it. If you have a Cardboard viewer, you ought to give a look to FordVR, the official virtual reality app from the automaker’s racing division. It launched this week with “The Return to Le Mans,” a 360-degree mini-documentary that chronicles the company’s epic battle against Ferrari to win the grueling 24 Hours of Le Mans race (LM GTE category) in France. You’ll experience the day from various perspectives: alongside the track, in the passenger seat of the Ford GT, and even on a Ferris wheel that overlooks the course as nighttime sets in. And of course, you can look freely around each view with the headset against your face, plus the app has a non-Cardboard option to watch in full-screen on the phone. A “World Rallycross with Ken Block” experience will be added next month. Not Golf It’s not exactly golf, but it is pretty fun. Following in the footsteps of side-scrolling games like Super Stickman Golf and Desert Golfing, Not Golf is an amusing little indie game that challenges you to fling a ball around the course—only you’re not aiming for a hole, but rather a direct hit against the gold placard. While the first course is relatively straightforward, before long you’ll find levels with the destination below the starting point, or where the ball is already moving when the stage begins.  Swiping and releasing your finger whips the ball in that direction, and you can course-correct in mid-air by swiping again, but each counts as a stroke: and just like in real golf, the goal here is to have a low-scoring game. Not Golf is super minimal in design, but if you dug Super Stickman Golf or especially its delightful spinoff Flappy Golf, then you’ll probably get a kick out of it.

If a few things had gone differently, Spain very well could have pulled off the upset. Whichever team faces them in the gold medal game (spoiler alert: it almost certainly will be Australia) won’t just be happy to be there, they will know that they really do have a chance to beat this team. Which is a good thing for the sport overall, I think. This year’s US men’s team has been more intriguing than previous editions because they’re clearly more vulnerable. It should be a great gold medal game.

Okay THAT might be the end of this Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 4.09pm EDT 16:09 Spain 69-78 USA, 2:16, 4th quarter And we get one final timeout before this game’s last run. Officials are getting their last chances at using their whistles. They call an offensive foul on Sergio Rodriguez who was heading to the basket, wiping away a crucial late score for Spain and getting the ball back to the US. Huge call that, and many in the crowd are very unhappy.

Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 4.03pm EDT 16:03 Spain 65-75 USA, 4:47, 4th quarter Except Thompson is sill Thompson and he makes a three pointer that feels like it could snuff out a less motivated team’s hopes. Instead, Nikola Mirotic, extremely quiet all game long, hits a much needed three. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 4.01pm EDT 16:01 Spain 62-72 USA, 6:09, 4th quarter Navarro gets a layup to put Spain on the board for this quarter. More importantly, Spain manages to get a few stops. Navarro hits a three-pointer and they’re starting to crawl back into this... Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 3.59pm EDT 15:59 Spain 57-72 USA, 7:33, 4th quarter Navarro’s jumper falls short out of the timeout. On the other side, Lowry makes his. That’s been the story of the last 10 minutes or so of basketball. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 3.57pm EDT 15:57 Spain 57-70 USA, 7:53, 4th quarter The US defense ramps up here, preventing Spain from getting anything off. It doesn’t help that they’ve been a bit too reliant on Gasol for their offense. Paul George hits a layup and Spain call another timeout. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 3.55pm EDT 15:55 Spain 57-68 USA, 9:23, 4th quarter Spain wins the jump ball but Rudy Fernandez misses a three.

Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 3.53pm EDT 15:53 Spain 57-66 USA, end of the 3rd quarter Durant hits a three-pointer here, giving the US some breathing room. DeAndre Jordan with a MAMMOTH DU- Oh, never mind, they call traveling on that. I forget this isn’t the NBA sometimes. Gasol tips in a Navarro miss and… Okay THAT DeAndre Jordan definitely counts and will mark the end of the third quarter. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 3.48pm EDT 15:48 Spain 56-61 USA, 2:27, 3rd quarter The timeout seems to do good for Spain. Gasol and Rodriguez hit back-to-back threes. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 3.47pm EDT 15:47 Spain 50-61 USA, 3:51, 3rd quarter And DeAndre Jordan with a thunderous dunk that causes Spain to take an immediate timeout. Jorge P (rightfully) calls me out on my parochialism: “But it has been a close affair at the half, which is usually the only hope you can have heading into an Olympic basketball game featuring the US squad.” Come on... The last three USA Vs. Spain have been close affairs nearly the whole way through. I’d even argue that 2008 would have been closer if FIBA rules had applied to USA as they did to the rest of the teams... and don’t even get me talking about the officiating in the 2004 game. Anyway, this is an older and not wiser Spain (except Rudy, who couldn’t get dumber I guess). So yeh, USA are about to run away with it. Mind you, Spain were awful in the 1996 Worlds and it came to a knifes edge Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 3.44pm EDT 15:44 Spain 50-59 USA, 4:14, 3rd quarter Kyrie Irving hits a jumper. The US could use one of his breakthrough games right now. DeAndre Jordan rebounds a Gasol miss, gets the ball to Durant who hits a layup. Reyes manages a second chance layup. And Irving with another layup. Maybe he is heating up here. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 3.42pm EDT 15:42 Spain 48-53 USA, 5:46, 3rd quarter Gasol tips in his own missed layup. Then he assists Sergio Llull on a three-pointer that cuts the US lead in half in a blink of an eye. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 3.40pm EDT 15:40 Spain 43-53 USA, 6:20, 3rd quarter Anthony with a layup and he gets fouled, that’s on Felipe Reyes. Anthony makes the free throw. And that’s a 10 point US lead. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 3.39pm EDT 15:39 Spain 43-50 USA, 7:08, 3rd quarter Llull finds Gasol for a jumper. Irving hits one for the US. Gasol misses on a three, after several great defensive stands, Gasol manages to tip in a missed Rubio jumper. Spain still very much alive here. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 3.37pm EDT 15:37 Spain 39-48 USA, 8:47, 3rd quarter Apparently the officials and the coaches had a little conference during halftime, hopefully there’ll be less officiating madness this half. And as soon as I type that, they call a foul on Gasol to put DeAndre Joran to the line. Jordan makes one of two. Email from Daniel Cavanillas It is hard to explain how much this Spanish team means to those of us who were born in Spain during the 80s or 90s. A whole generation has grown up watching Gasol, Navarro et al dominating the international scene and beating everyone but the USA. To see this bunch of players beat the Americans on their last tournament together would be a dream come true. Having said that, how do you rate Spain’s chances after the first half? I’m following the match from a bus heading to Stansted, so I don’t know what you make it it so far. I personally think that the US is going to pull ahead here in the second half, relatively soon but Spain have to be happy about the spot they’re in. They could very well pull this off. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 3.33pm EDT 15:33 Second half begins! Spain 39-47 USA, 9:39, 3rd quarter US wins the jump all. Klay Thompson, who’s been the man so far this game, knocks down a jumper to start off the second half. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 3.26pm EDT 15:26 Okay, it’s not just me here. MarkJonesESPN (@MarkJonesESPN) FIBA officials make me want to send weekly gifts to every NBA referee. All these technical fouls.

Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 3.22pm EDT 15:22 First half thoughts There were FIVE technical fouls called in the first 20 minutes of this game. This has been just a massively ugly game and a lot of it is on how the game is being called. But it has been a close affair at the half, which is usually the only hope you can have heading into an Olympic basketball game featuring the US squad.

Thompson hits the free throw. And there’s the third foul on Cousins. It puts Fernandez to the line, he makes both. Good luck to either team trying to get into any sort of rhythm today. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 3.15pm EDT 15:15 Spain 37-41 USA, 1:07, 2nd quarter Fernandez with a three.

This one’s on Cousins, who only has two somehow (okay mostly because he’s played very little, but still, this is an improvement compared to his normal rate.) Felipe Reyes to the line, he makes both free throws. And then Gasol gets called on a foul. This one puts Kyrie on the line, he makes both. This quarter is never going to end. DeMarcus Cousins goes up against Pau Gasol.

Okay these officials are kinda being dinks here this game and it’s starting to mess with the game itself. Thompson hits the technical free throw and he adds a jumper. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 3.08pm EDT 15:08 Spain 30-33 USA, 3:42, 2nd quarter Kevin Durant now picks up a technical foul. The US are going to have to keep their composure here. Navarro hits the free throw and it’s a one possession game! And Gasol’s back in the game. What did I tell you about this first half? Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 3.07pm EDT 15:07 Spain 29-33 USA, 4:08, 2nd quarter Willy Hernangomez is cleaning up the boards here.

Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 3.07pm EDT 15:07 Spain 25-33 USA, 5:17, 2nd quarter Okay that Thompson three was DEFINITELY a three.

Skip to content Naked Security Computer Security News, Advice and Research sophos.com Free Tools Go Award-winning computer security news Twitter Facebook Google+ LinkedIn Feed Worried about Google’s Your Timeline? Here’s how to disable tracking 24 Jul 2015 6 Android, Google, iOS, Mobile, Privacy Post navigation Previous: Artificial Intelligence expert likens AI dangers to nuclear weapons Next: SSCC 208 – (Cyber)crime and Punishment [PODCAST] by Lisa Vaas 0Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Google+ Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit There’s a shark tracker put out by the conservationists at OCEARCH that ties together the data emitted by tagged sharks, displaying the wanderings of the apex predators to fans. Now, thanks to Google, you too can consider yourself tagged. Google on Tuesday announced something called Your Timeline: a Google Maps tool that promises to enable users to “rediscover” the places we’ve been on any given day, the routes we’ve taken to get there, and the photos we took and which Google tucked away into Google Photos. This is all data that Google keeps track of on our behalf, all adding up to a rather terrifying portrait of how much the apex data predator snarfs down about us. “Only you can see your timeline,” Google says. From its post: Your Timeline is private and visible only to you; and you control the locations you choose to keep.  Thank God for that, given what Your Timeline reveals about: Your movements; What’s easily discernible as your home, down to the street address; The places you frequently go, which points to where your family, friends, illicit dalliances or political collaborators are located; The routes you take to get there; The businesses that you visited on any given day (as well as Google’s guess as to where you went, if you haven’t already confirmed its guesses); and Photos that document who you were with on a particular day at a specific place. Can we trust Google to keep such information safe and private? It would be nice to think so, but why even take that chance? Just ask the Ashley Madison cheaters whose private information has been breached how trusting we should be of sites that amass our data. My guess is that the short, expletive-free version would be “Not very.” How to erase your footprints Google says it’s easy to delete a day or your full history at any time. Users can also edit places that appear, including removing a specific location or giving a frequented spot a private name. Your Timeline is easy to disable: just go to your timeline page, and in the Settings menu (it’s the one with a cog icon) select “Pause Location History.” That will stop Google Maps from collecting places you go with your devices and adding them to your Location History map. You can also delete all the already-stored places from the Settings menu too – just select “Delete all Location History”. Google warns that doing either of these will limit functionality of some Google products over time, such as Google Maps and Google Now, so it’s up to you to decide if it’s appropriate for you. Note that pausing Location History doesn’t turn off Location Reporting or location services for a given device. If you want to completely turn off GPS or Wi-Fi location services, you can turn off your device’s main location feature with these steps, from a contributor to Google’s support forums. She notes that some of the information applies only to devices running Android 5.0 and higher. Note that disabling all location-finding features will throw a monkey wrench into the functioning of some popular apps, so it’s wise to carefully consider which you want to strip of location services. Here’s a cheat sheet on how to do it: On Android Open App drawer. Select Settings, then Location. Find Google Location Settings and individually switch off both Location Reporting and Location History. Underneath Location History, select “Delete Location History” to wipe clean the cache of locations. Repeat the steps for every Google account you have registered. On iOS Open Settings. Select Privacy, then Location Services. Either disable all Location Services using the slider at the top, or scroll through the list to decide, case-by-case, which apps you want to allow. At the bottom, select “System Services” and decide what features you want to allow. Also note that using Google Search and Maps will still cause some location data to be saved as part of your private Web & App Activity.

Here’s how to disable tracking” Anonymous says: July 24, 2015 at 7:30 pm Some day I will get arrested for doing 130 mph on the highway (when there are no other cars), it will be my phone that is used to clock me and used as evidence against me, since it will try and take a picture to prove I was driving while the GPS tracked the speed. My buddy uses google on his phone to track how fast he rides his bike and where he’s been… So it’s a matter of time. Guess I should put my phone in a shielded bag while driving ;) Reply 4caster says: July 25, 2015 at 5:15 am Anonymous can relax. For a speed measurement to be used to convict you, it has to be corroborated by an independent measurement or witness, even if only the word of a police officer who observed you going like a bat out of hell. But I don’t recommend driving at 130 mph on the public highway, even when you can see no other cars. Reply David Bear Holland says: July 27, 2015 at 2:17 pm Take you phone with you whilst ‘Sky-Diving’! Such fun, the phone would register your speed (at approx. 180mph and hardly change position!!! (NOT!)…. Reply confused says: July 26, 2015 at 4:19 am I just purchased my first android phone and I looked in the apps for anything with the word location in it. There are 4 which are Android specific settings and then there are Google Maps, Street View, and google play Store which I had already disabled but the Android apps e.g. Location Services I have no idea what to do with? Reply ejhonda says: July 27, 2015 at 3:51 pm Google is hardly accurate at tracking your location. When checking a trip I took from from NY to Atlanta, GA one time, it showed I took a quick side trip to Michigan from Atlanta, but returned to Atlanta after an hour. A more recent trip I took from NY to CT showed I took a quick side jaunt to Rhode Island. Neither of those side trips took place, and from the time lines associated with the side trips, it was quite obvious they were physically impossible unless I’m somehow unintentionally stepping into a time machine. Reply Rosa says: August 19, 2016 at 3:50 pm Same here… Google adds side trips for me that never occurred. It’s a pain in the butt when I try to look back, or search for a specific place for a reason, and I find it was replaced with some other information. Because then I’m at a loss for the details I went back to look for, PLUS I’m then stuck with the time-consuming problem of having to “fix things” (which btw often becomes tedious) to top it off. And if I’m on a time frame for those missing details we are now taking “frustration’ 😑 Bottom line, if I have to do detective work to figure out where I’ve been, how I got there, and exact arrival/departure information to fit the pieces of the puzzle correctly, well then… that pretty much defeats the purpose!!!

(Photo by Clive Brunskill/Getty Images) Viewers tuning into the Olympics and watching BMX cycling probably have a few thoughts. A) Wait, BMX is an Olympic sport? (Yes, it became an Olympic medal sport at the 2008 Beijing Olympics.) B) Why are the bikes so small? The latter question, in fact, is the top searched question about the sport, according to Google Trends. BMX bikes are small wonders. "Why are #BMX bikes so small?" is the top searched question about the sport. #Olympics pic.twitter.com/vf5SAASAoB — Google (@google) August 19, 2016 As Google explains, the smaller the bike, the bigger the jump. The bikes usually have 20-inch rim wheels and only have one gear. They’re designed to have a resistant frame to support the riders’ jumps throughout the course. Olympic BMX cycling is a sport that mixes racing and jumps and so riders need a lightweight bike to go fast and that can withstand the impact of landing repeatedly after jumps. At the Olympics, riders race around in a circuit of 300-meters to 400-meters with several jumps, rises and descents. The first four to cross the finish line advances to the following round. The national governing body of the sport in the United States, the American Bicycle Association, states on its website that the bikes are built small, “so you can go BIG.” Bikes promoted by the association have “20-inch wheels designed to accelerate in a hurry and handle the biggest landings,” according to the association’s website. There are a variety of BMX bikes for different purposes, but in general, “BMX is a sport built on the premise of racing fast, off-road tracks on a bicycle smaller and lighter than a road bike or mountain bike,” the adventure sports website Mpora stated in an articled published earlier this year. The BMX finals took place Friday afternoon, with American Connor Fields winning Team USA’s first gold in the event. Alise Post won silver in the women’s event, the best BMX finish for an American woman at the Olympics.

SEO is dead This is perhaps the most popular SEO-related myth and it ended up an urban legend, widely spread among sites and communities. If you believe that SEO is indeed dead, or if you’re just a pessimist, I assume the rest of the myths won’t be much useful to you. SEO changes and evolves, but as long as there are ways to help your site rank higher in the SERPs, SEO will still be here.  2. SEO is all about adding the right keywords There used to be a time when keyword density was (mistakenly) synonymous with a good SEO practice, but as search engines keep changing, so does our SEO strategy. Keywords are still important for optimisation, but the focus is more on the content and its relevance, rather than the exact keyword. The arrival of RankBrain made even clearer the focus on relevance, with the page being crawled for its content and emphasising the user experience, rather than the use of the exact keyword. No more awkward headlines to favour a specific keyword, let’s concentrate on the content’s meaning. 3. SEO is about a number one ranking Many “SEO ninjas” promise to land your business at the top spot for just $100, but even if they manage to deliver their promises, it isn’t just about the ranking.  Your SEO strategy should aim to increase traffic, engagement and eventually conversions and this cannot be achieved by merely focusing on the site’s position in SERPs.  It’s true that being on the first page of SERPs can lead to an increase of traffic to your page, but the goal is not to simply gain the top spot. For example, featured snippets, the summary of an answer to a user’s query that is displayed on top of Google search results, can lead to an increase of traffic of up to 20-30%, but 70% of them do not come from the first organic result. Thus, it’s the optimisation of the content, the usefulness and the relevance that may lead to additional traffic and make your SERP position more effective. 4. The more webpages you have, the better the ranking Quantity should not be preferred over quality. You can create as many webpages as you want if you feel that they add value to your site, but there’s no need to create additional pages hoping to increase your crawling from search engines. Not every page is indexed and quality is a crucial factor for your attempt to increase your site’s visibility, so keep that in mind next time you feel inclined to create new (pointless) pages. 5. Image optimisation is not necessary Image optimisation is important and although it’s a relatively easy process, we sometimes need to remind ourselves to do it when creating new content. As search engines cannot actually see your images, you need to provide the right description to make them ‘visible’. Google suggests you use descriptive titles and captions, while the use of a keyword can also be useful. Make sure you fill in the fields of title, alt text and description, as they all contribute to the increased chances of having your image visible in search engines. Also, keep in mind that a unique image has more chances to be seen, compared to a boring stock photo. 6. Mobile optimisation is overrated Do you still underestimate mobile optimisation in 2016?  Google’s push for mobile optimisation, most notably with the ‘mobile-friendly’ updates should tell you otherwise.  In Google’s own words: On average, people check their phones more than 150 times a day,  and more searches occur on mobile phones than computers. But if a potential customer is on a phone, and a site isn’t easy to use, they’re five times more likely to leave. To avoid losing out in these crucial moments, you need a site that loads quickly and is easy to use on mobile screens. The first step is seeing how your site is performing. We can help by scoring your site for mobile-friendliness, mobile speed, and desktop speed. Mobile optimisation is all about the user experience, whether it’s the design of the page, the responsiveness, the number of clicks, the page speed, or even the screen size. What’s more, we cannot underestimate Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP), Google’s latest attempt to improve the performance of mobile web articles in a light, fast version of a page. As it now arrives in organic search results, it’s becoming quite imperative to give it a try and enhance the user experience and hence, the traffic to your post. We have extensively covered mobile optimisation, but here are three posts I’m encouraging you to read if you want to learn more about the topic: Why and how to comprehensively test the mobile usability of your site When will responsive websites respond to user context? Google’s next mobile-friendly update will include page speed 7. SEO is not working for me If you feel that SEO is not working for perhaps you need to know more about SEO, or maybe you haven’t hired the right person for this task. SEO isn’t a quick fix to bring your site to the top of the SERPs, it’s a continuous process which needs to be re-evaluated and monitored to ensure its efficacy. As websites and search engines change, so do their optimisation for improved visibility, so if you feel that SEO hasn’t worked for you in the past, then maybe it’s time to start all over again with one step at a time, until you understand enough the process to examine your progress on your site and its “crawlability”. 8. Link building is dead Link building has been proclaimed dead many times, but it’s still around, keeping up with the changes of our times. Link building is about creating links with the ultimate goal to increase a site’s presence (and traffic). It may not be efficient anymore to be part of a private blog network or use spammy anchor text, but the fundamental goal of link building is still present, provided that we know how to use it. A link building strategy may be time consuming, but it may also be rewarding and let’s not forget the fact that links are still important ranking factors. According to “The State of Link Building Survey”, the most effective method of link building in 2016 is based in content, whether it’s promotion, or guest posting. What’s promising is the fact that the state of link building is still strong in 2016, as good links will always matter. 9. Social media does not affect SEO It’s easy to assume that social media has nothing to do with SEO, as your social traffic is not a ranking factor for SERPs, but this doesn’t mean that it still cannot influence your online presence. As social media usage keeps increasing, your authority is gradually building among many different platforms and this may help search engines with discovery and indexation. Moreover, content distribution has moved towards social media quite aggressively, which means that social sharing may contribute to effective link building and of course, increased traffic to your site. Social media marketing can help you increase your site’s visibility which is also appreciated by search engines. Think of how Google+ can be “spotted” by Google, or how the indexed tweets can increase the brand awareness, and eventually your credibility. Although there is no guarantee that a successful social presence can boost your SEO, but there is an indication that it can help it. And here are more examples on how social media can actually benefit your SEO efforts. 10. Local SEO is not for everyone Local SEO is becoming more important year-by-year, but not everyone understands yet how it can be useful even in the least expected case. You don’t have to own a local business (or even have a physical presence) to benefit from local SEO and here are some of our suggestions on how to take advantage of content gaps and structured data. What’s more, if you feel that your business is still struggling to benefit from local SEO, then maybe it’s time to start with a few basic steps, in order to help its local visibility. First of all, is your business listed on Google Business? Do you pay enough attention on your reviews? (Yes, reviews affect your local search ranking) How is your customer service? Do you provide the right information on your online presence? Are you focusing on mobile customers? (94% of mobile searches are have a local intent) According to our own editor, Christopher Ratcliff: “Accurate and complete Google My Business information + accurate location data + positive customer reviews + traditional SEO tactics = good local ranking (possibly).” 11. Don’t worry about SEO just create good content I came across a tweet mentioning that quality content can beat any SEO optimisation, and that’s how this myth came up. It’s true that the quality of your content is important, but if you don’t optimise it (or promote it), how will you reach a wider audience? People have tried to dismiss technical SEO, but it’s what underpins an effective search strategy. As we’re crafting our SEO efforts for 2017 (yes, it’s closer than you think), it’s time to leave all these SEO myths behind. Haven’t we already heard enough of “SEO is dead”?

SUBSCRIBE The future of the map The leap from physical to digital maps was game-changing for marketers and consumers alike, but what's next on the horizon? Columnist Brian Smith explores some possibilities for the future of mapping. Brian Smith on August 19, 2016 at 10:06 am More We’ve come a long way since the days of unfolding a paper map across a dashboard just to plot the next move on our road trips. Though it’s unlikely maps will soon make another leap so dramatic as going from inhabiting our glove compartments to inhabiting our cell phones, digital maps continue to evolve at an astonishing pace. Here’s a look at the direction future maps are heading — and its implications for local marketing. Going beyond and below the pin Today, the digital map is dominated by the pin. That’s not likely to change. Pins simply make it easy to find locations on a map — too easy to ever fall out of use. However, that doesn’t mean the area around the pin will remain static. In fact, we’re seeing the buildings the pins represent undergoing a radical transformation in their clickability. If you open Google Maps and zoom in on your current location, you’ll notice that the walls of the buildings around you have become much more distinct and “3-D” — so much so that they cast tiny digital shadows. The buildings themselves have become so visually enticing recently it’s almost as if Google wants you to click on them… which of course is precisely what Google wants you to do. As of right now, only the largest, the most iconic and the most frequently visited buildings are getting this clickable treatment. For example, take a look at Rio’s Olympic soccer stadium, the Maracanã. By zooming in and clicking on it, Google literally blows the roof right off the building by allowing you to toggle through its various floors, making it easy to find things like bathrooms and stairs. Places like shopping malls and sporting venues are the current primary beneficiaries of indoor mapping. While the mapping feature is underutilized at the moment, don’t expect it to stay that way for long. As businesses and consumers become more familiar with the feature, buildings you’re less likely to get lost in will begin implementing indoor mapping as well. The likely early adopters will be big-box retailers, especially if their businesses inhabit multiple floors with multiple departments (or even multiple businesses) under the same roof. But other industries are ripe for mapping the great indoors as well. Hospitals, with their labyrinth of various medical offices, are likely early adopters. So, too, are sprawling universities and hotels. Your business location can be an early adopter, too, if you feel so inclined. All you have to do is submit your indoor location information to Google here. But let’s say you’re a small business that isn’t located in a shopping mall; why should you care about implementing indoor mapping? Because inventory mapping is the future of local marketing.  Inventory mapping These days, customers do so much pre-shopping online that they’ve often picked out their product long before they set foot in a store. This is especially true for millennials, who would prefer to skip chitchatting with the sales associate and simply pick up the item they came for at the discounted price of the coupon they dug up online. There’s an obvious need for inventory mapping — just ask anyone who has ever tried to find a tool at Home Depot on their own. It’s no coincidence that Home Depot employs some of the best sales associates in the business; we’d literally be lost without them! Granted, Home Depot does have a map with inventory placement on their app, but that only does you good if you happen to have downloaded the app. Therefore, the logical next step in the evolution of mapping technology is inventory finding and tracking. Eventually, we’ll reach the point where inventory is integrated with the map, and a click on a product ad will not only lead you to the store with that product in stock, but also to the very shelf it sits on. Many companies, Target in particular, are making excellent strides in terms of product mapping for customers. But making the connection between local searches and the product on the shelf has yet to be realized. Most likely the breakthrough will come in the form of RFID or some other real-time location system. While beacons are frequently touted for their ability to push (or hassle) customers with notifications, they are proximity-based, and so they don’t track individual items. RFID technology, on the other hand, has the advantage of being incorporated directly into the product. Not only does RFID allow the tracking of individual items on the shelf, but it also allows the tracking of individual customers as they push their carts down the aisles — assuming they have products in their carts. Self-driving cars, drones and the need for real-time mapping Another aspect of mapping that’s going to continue to develop at breakneck speed is real-time mapping. The big push behind this need is self-driving cars and automated drones, both on the ground and in the air. Interestingly enough, self-driving cars, with their abundance of cameras and sensors feeding road conditions back to the fleet in real time, are likely to provide a major part of the solution. As the speed at which maps are updated continues to improve, this opens up exciting opportunities for temporary locations. Granted, temporary locations do sometimes appear on Google Maps — for example, a search for the beach volleyball venue at the Rio Olympics will appear on the map even though the stadium won’t last much longer than the summer games. However, for the vast majority of us, it isn’t likely we’ll be hosting the Olympic games in our neighborhood anytime soon. But that’s precisely where the greatest potential for temporary events lies. Think local farmer’s markets, music festivals, bike races and the like. Facebook does an excellent job at letting you know what temporary events are happening near you, but temporary events and locations have yet to be implemented on the major mapping providers. I’d expect that to soon begin to change. Mapping the virtual and physical world Another thing to keep an eye on with the future of maps and local marketing is the overlapping of the physical world with the virtual. As I mentioned in my Pokémon Go article, augmented reality opens up the potential for virtual billboards that will significantly rely on mapping technology for their placement. From a legal standpoint, very little has been done to define the digital property rights that overlap the physical world. But my guess is that that the physical ownership of property will eventually equate to the virtual ownership of the same space. If this happens, you can be certain that digital mapping precision will take on an even greater importance. Google Maps becomes an increasingly walled garden Ads have officially arrived on Google Maps. As such, Google would prefer that you not leave the map — unless of course, you click on an ad. In an effort to keep you in Google Maps longer, and therefore increase the likelihood of your clicking on an ad, expect Google Maps to become an increasingly walled garden. The only way Google accomplishes this is by improving the utility of Maps through things like indoor mapping and by returning increasingly personalized local search results directly to the map. Furthermore, you can be certain that as the utility of digital maps improves, so will the importance of local search. Mapping the great indoors is the next frontier. But it’s only the beginning. It’s time brands take a long look at the map and start plotting a course for the future ahead.

SUBSCRIBE Google says bots are the main target of Keyword Planner changes; a lot of questions remain Advertisers and agencies continue to have questions about how potential data restrictions will affect their research efforts. Ginny Marvin on August 19, 2016 at 9:40 am More When Google announced last week it was limiting access to Keyword Planner data, it raised more questions than it answered. Will new advertisers be able to get detailed Keyword Planner data before setting up and launching campaigns? As a refresher, the notice from last week (bolding added): Advertisers with lower monthly spend may see a limited data view in the Keyword Planner. For example, you may see values such as 0, 1-100, 100-1K, 1K-10K, 10K-100K, 100K-1M, 1M+ in the average monthly searches column. In addition, other advertisers may trigger the limited data view by reaching a limit on the number of searches for search volume data (specifically, requests to our API). What does “lower monthly spend” even mean — $100 per month, $1,000 per month? That’s just a start. The explanation given, “These changes will ensure that AdWords advertisers are able to get the data they need to optimize their accounts,” seemed to belie the action taken by penalizing smaller advertisers. The move was clearly aimed at non-advertisers using the tool for research (SEOs and others) and third parties querying on a heavy basis via the API. But following the vague criteria given, the explanation didn’t square with many advertisers, either. On Thursday, CassieH, the Google representative who has been communicating these changes on the AdWords Community forum, added more detail (bolding added): This change was made so that we can consistently give advertisers the data they need to optimize their accounts, while preventing ‘bots’ and other services from abusing the intended use of Keyword Planner. The search volume estimates, though displayed differently in some cases, still provide an accurate and helpful view of how many clicks and impressions keywords may receive. This latest explanation puts the emphasis on the high-frequency abuse, not the individual researchers using the Planner. If frequent pings by bots are the main problem, is this really the only way to handle them? Why cut off access to all non-paying accounts — many of which are held by high-paying agencies — if high-frequency abuse is the real reason for the change? And there’s an argument to be made that the broad ranges of search volumes given when detail is not available do not “provide an accurate and helpful view” of potential volume. It’s understandable why Google won’t provide explicit thresholds on query frequency — those executing the bots could potentially adjust to come under the maximum limit. But it still doesn’t explain the pay-to-use policy coupled with frequency limits unless it is also aimed at SEOs and other researchers using the tool for free. To add to the confusion, Google’s execution of this change came amid technical glitches and a switch to reporting the same search volumes for close variants. When users started seeing warnings that they’d need an active account to use Keyword Planner earlier this summer, Google assured Search Engine Land in June that this was not the case. Turns out it is. Among the concerns advertisers have expressed on the AdWords Community Forum following the news last week: Paul R: “[M]any people inside an agency may use the KW planner tool for research but do not use the account in which they manage clients’ account[s].” Bill H: “The basis of my worry is how a move like this could create an even more tilted playing field, favoring large companies over SMBs or startups.” Steph W: “How are we able to figure out new budgets if the account hasn’t even started yet?” CassieH has reiterated that “most advertisers running paid campaigns will not be affected by this change.” I have still been able to access full Keyword Planner data in accounts that have never had or don’t currently have active campaigns. I assume that access to detailed data will end after a certain number of queries in the Planner, but it makes me wonder if new advertisers, at least, will have running room to do initial research before launching. Google has not responded to a request for comment on this. The restriction, of course, is another blow to SEOs, who started losing access to organic query data starting in 2011, culminating in 2013 with 100 percent “not provided.” The reality is that Google’s keyword research tools were designed to help advertisers develop their search campaigns. The availability of the External Keyword Tool for years, however, set expectations that it should be open and available to all. A few milestones in the evolution of Google’s keyword tools: In 2005, Google launched the AdWords Keyword Suggestion Tool, which required account login. The older, less sophisticated Google AdWords Keyword Sandbox eventually became the External Keyword Tool that anyone could access. In 2010, Google rolled out a big update to the Keyword Tool. At SMX East that year, a Google representative clarified that the keyword tool was only providing data on “commercial” keywords, i.e., queries that would trigger ads. In 2013, Google sunsetted the Keyword Tool and launched Keyword Planner, which combined Traffic Estimator and Keyword Tool. With that change, Keyword Planner became accessible only through AdWords, eliminating the External Keyword Tool. As a workaround, non-advertisers simply signed up for an AdWords account and didn’t activate any campaigns. With this latest change, bots and services using the API appear to be the primary targets. The question remains how the change will affect advertisers and agencies who use the Planner in no- and low-spend accounts and those with MCCs that do heavy research.

According to a Bloomberg estimate, the deal could be valued at about $680 million. Uber, whose "anyone-can-be-a-cabbie" business model has already shaken up the taxi industry, is also looking to provide autonomous car services in cities. Later this month, the company plans to begin testing self-driving cars on the streets of Pittsburgh, although a human -- an Uber engineer rather than a regular self-employed driver -- will remain at the wheel to take over if there's trouble. These recent moves signal Uber's desire to take human drivers out of its business equation entirely. The timing is noteworthy as just yesterday, a U.S. District Court judge in California rejected the company's proposal to settle a class-action lawsuit by current and former Uber drivers who claimed they should be classified as employees rather than independent contractors. Otto Plus Uber = 'Dream Team' Co-founded by several veterans of Google, including Anthony Levandowski, who was formerly an engineer with Google's Self-Driving Car Project, Otto just launched in May. The company, which has been testing sensor-equipped autonomous trucks (pictured above), said its mission is to improve highway safety and trucking efficiency. "Together with Uber, we will create the future of commercial transportation: first, self-driving trucks that provide drivers unprecedented levels of safety; and second, a platform that matches truck drivers with the right load wherever they are," the company noted yesterday in a blog post. When it comes to this advanced technology stack, Otto plus Uber is a "dream team," Uber co-founder and CEO Travis Kalanick wrote in a post on his company's blog yesterday. "Anthony is one of the world's leading autonomous engineers: his first invention, a self-driving motorcycle called Ghostrider, is now in the Smithsonian," Kalanick said. "Just as important, Anthony is a prolific entrepreneur with a real sense of urgency." Like Otto, Uber promotes its technology as a way to improve efficiency and safety on the road. Kalanick cited statistics showing that some 90 percent of the 1 million people killed in collisions every year are caused by human error. "This is a tragedy that self-driving technology can help solve," he said. 'Outrageous PR Stunt' In a separate development, Bloomberg Businessweek reported yesterday that through a partnership with Volvo, Uber will begin deploying specially equipped Volvo XC90 sports utility vehicles to test self-driving technology with real-life Uber customers in Pittsburgh. Passengers requesting rides will randomly get self-driving cars instead of regular Uber vehicles, although two Uber employees will be in front to monitor the cars' performances and take over if issues arise. John Simpson, Privacy Project director at the advocacy organization Consumer Watchdog, which has urged caution and strict regulation for self-driving vehicle technology, called Uber's Pittsburgh tests an "outrageous PR stunt." "There has been no adequate demonstration that Uber's robot cars are safe," Simpson told us today. "It is unconscionable for them to offer rides to passengers at this stage." Uber's move into autonomous trucks with its purchase of Otto shows it is "doubling down on its bet on robot technology, but we're simply not there yet," he added. One trucking concept, called "platooning," would involve using a lead truck to control a series of other big rigs behind it, but a human driver would still be needed to monitor those vehicles, Simpson said. "Self-driving trucks, because of their size and weight, raise serious safety issues if there is an attempt to operate them intermingled with car traffic," he said.

The world's fifth largest automaker hopes to enter into a symbiotic relationship, where it will bring its manufacturing prowess to Google and the Silicon Valley giant will help the automaker's autonomous technology development. "Hyundai is lagging behind the competition to develop autonomous vehicles," Ko Tae Bong, senior auto analyst at Hi Investment & Securities Co, told Bloomberg News. "It's not a choice but a critical prerequisite for Hyundai to cooperate with IT companies, such as Google, to survive in the near future." Google Google's self-driving Lexus pilot project. At a news conference with Korea's Minister of Trade on Wednesday, Haeng said that "because Google is not too familiar with vehicles" his company can help with the execution of Google's self-driving vehicle, which is one of the most advanced in the market. The two companies are already connected in that Google's self-driving vehicle project is being led by John Krafcik, the former CEO of Hyundai Motor America; Krafcik left Hyundai in 2013. Hyundai also has been among the most aggressive automakers adopting Alphabet's Android Auto and Apple's CarPlay, which allow the iPhone and Android smartphones to connect wirelessly to car infotainment systems. Hyundai Hyundai has been the most aggressive carmaker in deploying Google's Android Auto smartphone interface. This is not the first time Google has sought expertise from an automaker. In May, Google announced it was buying 100 plug-in hybrid minivans from Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) to expand its autonomous technology. "This collaboration with [FCA] is the first time we've worked directly with an automaker to create our vehicles," Google said in a blog at the time. "FCA will design the minivans so it's easy for us to install our self-driving systems, including the computers that hold our self-driving software, and the sensors that enable our software to see what's on the road around the vehicle." Google's self-driving vehicle division has also joined forces with major carmakers and ride-sharing services to form a coalition to lobby lawmakers and regulators for faster adoption of self-driving car technology. In all, five companies -- Alphabet, Ford, Lyft, Volvo and Uber -- formed the Self-Driving Coalition for Safer Streets coalition. Its mission: to spur the federal government to usurp a "patchwork" of state driving laws that could hinder autonomous vehicle acceptance.

Apple, Amazon and Google are all in the race but who will take the history-making title. By James Billington August 19, 2016 18:21 BST Who will be the world's first trillion dollar company? Apple could be one launch away but is Amazon is a rising threat Reuters The race to become the first trillion dollar company is on and the big three in contention is Apple, Google and Amazon. But which one will cross the line first? It's been widely assumed for many years that Apple would be the favourite to break this barrier with an indomitable rise to the top of the tech tree, but after a recent shift in smartphone sales this has been thrown into doubt. As Apple hits a slight speed bump it's Amazon that's moving up through the pack - even projected to slingshot past thanks to its ventures outside e-retail. Despite ranking some way behind Apple's $582 billion valuation at $365 billion, Amazon's wide-ranging ventures offer a future that gives it a bright future to reach that target. Through its Amazon Web Services, which offers hosting to some of the world's biggest companies, as well as its move into the space race, drone delivery and a logistics service, its moves on the line graph have been heading steadily northwards in 2016. This sharply contrasts Apple, who have endured a shaky downward dive since 2015. Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos is now the third richest man in the worldReuters In an article by The Motley Fool, however, it believes that despite the slide in iPhone sales all it will take is one big product push from Apple to get it well on-track to hit the $1 trillion mark. But don't hold your breath for that to happen this year. With the 2016 iPhone 7 expected to rock a less than different look and a controversial removal of the headphone socket, which will undoubtedly perturb those millions of consumers who are worried about the fate of their 3.5mm audio cabled headphones. But we're reminded that Apple is still the world's biggest company for a reason. Its Q1 2016 profit result of $18.4 billion is still the highest by any company on record. Ever. Experts recognise the smartphone market is becoming an increasingly more difficult place for Apple but also know its history, expertise and resources are a delicious recipe for success. Its 2018 iPhone, the ten-year anniversary since it first left consumers slack-jawed, is expected to overhaul the handset fans have been waiting for (or expect at every new launch). Rumours of a totally new design and OLED display might just be enough to have consumers gushing once more and if the Apple Car rumblings are to anything to go by it may well be enough to put the wind back into its sails. But, that's still an 'if'. Samsung has taken the game to Apple. Budget, high-quality handsets from the likes of OnePlus have rocked the market. As for the expected electric/autonomous car effort, well there's still the little issue of Audi, Jaguar, Ford, Nissan and Uber to name a few to compete with. Life is a little more secure for Amazon, however. It's already taking home a huge slice of markets where it reigns supreme and doesn't have to look over its shoulder. Estimates that global retail sales will surpass $28 trillion by 2018, and Infrastructure-as-a-service (Iaas) spending will reach $141 billion by 2019. The long-term growth here is something that will power an upward trend for years to come. What about Google? How could we discount Google, its parent company now rebranded as Alphabet. It's currently valued at $538 billion so is by no means a small fish. It's search engine is the internet epitomised, it's behind Android – the most widely used mobile OS in the world – and has been investing in everything from VR to medical tech. Research claims Alphabet will post a rise in profits of 16 percent in the next two years, with revenues of $96 billion in 2018. Its stock is strong and if it continues it could soon become favourite to hit a trillion dollar valuation first. All three companies are dominant players but if money were to be put on the line, experts are backing Amazon based on its diverse portfolio of investments and ventures putting it in a prime position. "To be sure, Apple and Alphabet both offer investors plenty to like, but I see Amazon as the tech company with the most favourable outlook to reach and grossly surpass a $1 trillion valuation in the decades to come," the article read.

Google Trekker is taking on Indiana parks and trails WRTV Show Caption Hide Caption Previous Next ZIONSVILLE, Ind. -- Google Trekker is crisscrossing Indiana this summer, mapping out the state's parks and trails. There are 15 cameras inside the Trekker that simultaneously take a photo every 2.5 seconds creating a 360 degree panoramic view. Once they're done in Indiana, it will take 6 to 12 months for Google to process all the images. Faces will be blurred for privacy reasons as well as other identifying images like license plates.  The final product will allow people to actually see Indiana's parks and trails, just like street view on Google maps. Lisa Nye, Executive Director of the Indiana Park & Recreation Association says their goal in bringing the Google Trekker to Indiana has to do with health and sedentary lifestyles, "The Google Trekker program allows us to show Hoosiers all the amazing trails, greenways, waterways and parks available to them in an effort to get citizens to unplug, and go out and get active," said Nye. You can track the Google Trekker's progress, or view pictures and videos at #indianagoogletrekker on Twitter @INParkandRec , or on the Indiana Park and Recreation Association's Facebook page .      Copyright 2016 Scripps Media, Inc.

But while the Big Four TV conglomerates celebrate single-digit ad-revenue growth, they may want to look outside their sector for a reality check. This story first appeared in the August 16, 2016 issue of Variety. Subscribe today.See more. Over the past few months, Facebook has managed to surpass the domestic ad revenue of Comcast, CBS Corp., Disney, and 21st Century Fox. The $13.1 billion that the social-media company and Google brought in together in the second quarter dwarfs the Big Four’s combined take. (Facebook’s domestic data includes Canada, while Google considers the U.S. alone.) Google has always had many times the ad revenue of Facebook, but Facebook is closing the gap at a rapid rate. In fact, it’s the growth rates here that are the most striking. At a 64% trajectory, Facebook grew eight times more than CBS Corp., the fastest-growing entertainment company. At that rate, it won’t be long before Facebook gets to Google’s current scale in the U.S., far surpassing the major TV companies combined. And Facebook’s global ad revenue is twice its domestic take-up. sources: Company Reporting, jackdaw research Analysis One of the big reasons for Facebook’s spike is advertisers’ response to the personalized nature of its advertising. Whereas Facebook can individually target its monthly and daily active user base (226 million in the U.S. and 175 million in Canada at the end of June) based on a granular understanding of their personal characteristics, the major TV companies know far less about their audiences, relying on broad demographics.  The Big Four’s online offerings do a little better in this department. But with an audience fragmented across pay TV, branded sites, apps, and third-party online services like Hulu and Sling TV, it’s impossible for buyers to get a real sense of who TV viewers are, or what their interests might be. Facebook now generates an average of $50 of revenue per year from its users in the U.S. and Canada, up from $34 a year ago and $21 the year before that. But there’s no comparable metric for the TV companies. Another big advantage Facebook enjoys is that some of its ad units generate revenue only if they lead to specific consumer actions. Known in the industry as “attribution,” it’s a feature TV still can’t offer. So while the TV industry toasts itself on a slightly better quarter, Facebook and Google will continue to walk away with a growing slice of the overall ad revenue pie. Put in that context, it’s harder to celebrate the TV industry’s modest achievements. Jan Dawson is the founder and chief analyst at Jackdaw Research, an advisory firm for the consumer technology market.

Searching "how to vote" now brings up an enhanced search feature Millions of Americans are turning to the internet to figure out how to cast their ballots this fall—and online searches related to the election are already much higher than they were in 2012, according to data released by Google. Google searches related to voter registration are up 323% compared to four years ago, led by swing states like Ohio and Pennsylvania. Vermont, home base of former Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders, saw the biggest spike in searches related to the election, a rise of 358% compared to 2012. Voter registration data isn’t yet available for this year, but Google’s data offers some early insight into trends. To serve the many people searching for election information, Google has rolled out new features including an enhanced “how to vote” search result launched this week and a “how to register” search result launched earlier in the summer “This is a special election, where we’re seeing a huge increase in the information needs people are coming to us in terms of the election,” said Emily Moxley, Google’s project manager for the “how to vote” search feature. Google often sees a spike in voting-related searches after big news events, like Hillary Clinton’s speech at the Democratic National Convention in July, which coincided with Donald Trump’s condemnation of the father of a fallen Muslim U.S. soldier: There was a 190% increase in voter registration searches compared to the weeks leading up to the convention.

Google Duo managed to outrank established apps such as "Pokémon GO" and Facebook Messenger in download numbers.  ( Google Play Store ) Advertisement Google recently launched its Google Duo app and the software already outranked all other free apps in the Play Store. Android users seem to really enjoy the video chatting app, which got an icon revamping just prior to its launch. It is a little surprising that the software ranks high in users' preferences, as it was optimized to work in any country (well, any country that Google operates in). Looking at the Play Store's Top Free Android Apps chart, Google Duo rules supreme in the first place, outpacing established names such as Facebook Messenger, Pokémon GO, Snapchat, Facebook, YouTube Music and Instagram. Justin Uberti, Duo's technical lead, showed his enthusiasm in a tweet underlining the success of the app. Google Duo now launched in all countries. #1 app in the Play Store, 4.5 star rating! pic.twitter.com/hbN09ku20k — Justin Uberti (@juberti) August 18, 2016 How sustainable the leading position of Duo remains to be seen, but the surging interest shows that Google did a fine job. Previous reports indicated that some people in North America could not verify their phone numbers via SMS, but luckily that issue got resolved. Over the two days since Duo hit the Play Store, support for additional markets was added. However, it looks like the global rollout has reached its terminus. Users whose handsets are sporting Android 4.1 or newer can tap into Google's new video chatting app, no matter where they are located. Keep in mind that Duo simply asks for your phone number to get started, and allows users to connect with existent contacts from their handset. Google optimized the software to work flawlessly in poor conditions, and the app can simply switch to audio calling if Wi-Fi connectivity is weak. While the market is flooded with a plethora of video calling apps, Google Duo was crafted with speed in mind. The software works on Web Real-Time Communication (WebRTC) and Google coded it to make video calling as simple as possible. Duo is mobile-exclusive and its developer touts fewer dropped calls, regardless if the user is using cellular connection or Wi-Fi. The good news is that the app can juggle between cellular and Wi-Fi while making calls. What is more, it was built with cross-platform support in mind, making it easy for iOS users to receive calls from their Android counterparts and vice versa.

"Under the plain meaning of the Wiretap Act, the 'ordinary course of business' exception protects an electronic communication service provider's interception of email where there is 'some nexus between the need to engage in the alleged interception and the [provider's] ultimate business, that is, the ability to provide the underlying service or good,'" U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh wrote. In 2013, users filed a putative class action against Google, claiming its email service practices violated wiretap laws. Lead plaintiff Daniel Matera claims Google is intercepting and scanning emails for commercial purposes.  Google doesn't totally disagree. Back in 2013, conceded that the snooping is an intrinsic part of its email service, contending that scanning messages is the only way it can keep Gmail free and pay for the cost of maintaining it is through targeted advertising. It has also said that none of this information is read by human eyes, but that it is all machine-scanned. Google also points out that users have agreed to this by signing up to the terms and conditions that must be ticked before you can open a Gmail account.  But in a 38-page order, Koh challenged Google's email interception and scanning policy, noting that it was not necessary or intrinsic to the process of email delivery. Rather, she noted, it is done so solely so Google can sell the data it collects or use it for targeted advertising. While that practice may have merit, Koh said it was simply too soon to rule on it.  "At the motion to dismiss stage, the court cannot say that Google's alleged interception of email is within the 'ordinary course of business' as a matter of law," she noted. In a separate case filed this year, several universities sued Google over its email practices. They argue Google provides email services simply so it can mine the data of students.  Dropsuite Releases Office 365 Back-Up Service Dropsuite just released a new Office 365 email backup and archiving service that it claims has an enhanced end user experience that makes it easier to use. Microsoft Office 365 has more than 60 million monthly active commercial users, with 50,000 small businesses added every month, according to Microsoft reported in July. Office 365 resellers who partner with Dropsuite can offer Dropmyemail to their customers to backup their emails, contacts, calendars and tasks within Office 365. Dropmyemail can also be  integrated into the IT Service Providers’ infrastructure, so small and medium-size businesses (SMB) can buy email backup and archiving with just a few clicks. Dropsuite is a software platform that enables SMBs to backup, recover and protect their digital assets. It offers this service through a network of reseller partners. Nintex Puts Drawloop Doc Generator on Salesforce AppExchange Workflow automation and document generation vendor Nintex just pushed its Drawloop Document Generation application onto the Salesforce AppExchange. It allows users to generate richly-formatted, branded documents inside Salesforce in formats such as Word, Excel and PowerPoint as well as PDFs. It is also optimized  for the Salesforce1 Mobile App, and comes with a component for customers using the Salesforce Lightning Experience. “We’re all about simplifying the document creation process for sales, service, and marketing professionals,” said Jim Roberson, Nintex Drawloop Vice President and General Manager in a statement. He thinks the app will accelerate sales and service processes by automating the creation of sales quotes, order forms, proposals, invoices, contracts, account summaries, service documents and other sales related documents. It also automates data-driven processes that can update record stages, trigger approval routing and additional documents, as well as write data back to Salesforce, schedule tasks, or even create a new record automatically. Based in Bellevue, Wash., 10-year-old Nintex enables IT professionals to create and manage sophisticated business processes.  Microsoft Adds Office Muscle To Edge Browser Microsoft has added a new extension to the Edge toolbar that gives users direct access to all their Office documents and files. Microsoft Edge is a web browser developed by Microsoft and included in the company's Windows 10 operating systems, replacing Internet Explorer. The extension puts an Office icon on the Microsoft Edge toolbar to give users direct access the files whether they are stored online or on the desktop, thanks to integration with OneDrive and OneDrive for Business. The extension allows users to create and open Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote and Sway documents using Office Online directly from the browser. It also keeps track and surfaces any recent documents that you have opened with Office Online to help you find the documents you need faster.  0 Comments Top Articles Related Articles Recent Comments Gartner Rates 4 ECM Vendors Leaders, Drops 3 Others to Challengers Dropbox Is Reinventing Itself to Win More Love From IT 7 Big Problems with the Internet of Things Simplicity is the Future of Customer Engagement Standardized Processes: Great in Theory, Not in Practice Turn Off Your Printer: It's Almost World Paper Free Day Google Adds Slack Integration to G Suite, More News Dropbox Paper Enhances Collaboration, More Document News Adobe Updates Acrobat DC to Improve Document Editing, Signing Google Drive Search Gets a Natural Language Boost, More News Useful Article?

Featured Story: Amazon's Best Black Friday Tech Deals 2016—TVs, Phones & Tablets Smartphones: help for cell phones, pdas, iphones, android, and more — WonderHowTo How To: Add Your iTunes Library to Google Play Music & Stream Songs from Any Device Dallas Thomas 3 weeks ago How to Add Your iTunes Library to Google Play Music & Stream Songs from Any Device It's always a pain to make sure you have enough storage on your smartphone. Pictures and videos occupy a lot of space, so your music library has to take a back seat—otherwise, you might see that pesky "Storage Full" notification at any time. If you have a large music library, you stand to save quite a few gigabytes of storage by removing the MP3, M4A, and other song file types from your phone and just streaming them from a cloud-based music service instead. This can also serve as a great way to transfer your favorite songs from your iPhone over to a new Android device (or vice versa), as the files are stored on a remote server, and can be accessed from any smartphone. When it comes to cloud-based music streaming, there's no better service than Google Play Music. Without ever paying a penny, you can upload up to 50,000 tracks to Google's rock-solid servers, then stream this music directly to your iPad, iPhone, iPod touch, or Android device. You can even upload your iTunes library to free yourself from Apple Music, and all you need is a Mac or a Windows PC to set things up. Step 1: Find Your Music Folder For most users, this first step should be easy—just locate any MP3s, M4As, or other supported song files that you have saved to your computer's hard drive. If you're going to upload your iTunes library, this folder is pretty easy to find on both Mac OS X and Windows. Finding Your iTunes Library in Mac OS X With a Mac, you can find your iTunes library by opening Finder, then heading to the Users folder and selecting your user name. From here, open the Music folder, then you'll find a subfolder called "iTunes." Keep this finder window open for later, as you'll be dragging and dropping this folder into Google Play Music's web interface. Finding Your iTunes Library in Windows To find your iTunes music folder on a Windows PC, head to the C:\ drive in Windows Explorer, then open the Users folder. From here, open the folder with your name on it, then do the same with the Music folder inside of that. At this point, you should see the iTunes folder clear as day. Step 2: Upload Songs to Google Play Music Google Play Music's web interface only lets you upload songs if you're using the Google Chrome browser. If you don't want to install Chrome, you can download the official Music Manager application and upload songs to Google Play that way instead. Note: All Files Will Be Converted to MP3s Google Play Music lets you upload several different file types (MP3, M4A, OGG, M4P, FLAC, and WMA), but it will convert all of your uploads into the MP3 format along the way. For some of these formats, the conversion process will take some extra time, so be patient. You should also be aware that, while most of your music's metadata will be saved (things like album artwork and artist info), other information, like iTunes ratings and comments, may be lost, as these are not compatible with Google Play Music. Uploading from Chrome Head to the Google Play Music website using Chrome on your computer, then sign into your Google account. From here, click the menu button in the top-left corner of the screen. Next, scroll down to the very bottom of the menu on the lefthand side of your screen, then select the "Upload music" option. At this point, you'll see the "Upload music" menu. If you'd like, you can click the "Select From Your Computer" button to open a file browser menu, which would then allow you to find and select song file folders to upload. However, the easiest way to do this is to simply drag your music folder from Finder or Windows Explorer, then drop it directly on this screen. To do that, just open the two windows side-by-side, then drag the folder over with your mouse or trackpad. The same goes if you're uploading your iTunes music library—just drag the iTunes folder over instead. The upload process can take several hours, depending on how much music you're uploading, so leave your browser open until it's finished. While it's working, you'll see an up-arrow in the bottom-left corner of the screen, complete with a circular progress bar that lets you know how much longer it will take. Uploading from Music Manager If you're using the Music Manager app instead of Chrome, it's even easier. Just open the app up, choose "Upload songs to Google Play" and hit "Continue," then choose where you want to grab the files from. The app can automatically locate your iTunes folder, as well as other music folders and files if you select those options. Just keep following the prompts until it starts uploading your files. Step 3: Stream from the Google Play Music App on Android or iOS Once your music has finished uploading to Google's servers, you can play it at any time from any web browser, or from your iOS or Android device. To start, just install the Google Play Music app for your particular mobile operating system, then sign in with the same Google account you used to upload the music. Install Google Play Music for Android (Google Play Store) Install Google Play Music for iPad, iPhone, or iPod touch (iOS App Store) Once you've done that, you'll see all of your songs mixed in with the free streaming music offered by Google Play. If you'd rather only see the songs you uploaded yourself, head to the side navigation menu in the app, then select "Music library." At this point, you can remove any song files that are stored on your smartphone, as your music has a home in the cloud now—though you can still download tracks to your smartphone for offline playback by "pinning" them in the Google Play Music app. And unlike iTunes Match or Apple Music, an exact copy of the original file is kept on Google's servers, so you don't have to worry about rare recordings being lost or converted into a mainstream version. Streaming your own music library is completely free, so you never have to pay a dime to get this awesome functionality. However, you can sign up for Google Play Music's "All Access" service for $9.99/month to get access to millions of streaming songs and podcasts, seamlessly integrated with your own uploads, which also comes with the ad-free YouTube Red service. In the future, you can add new songs to your library by using the same "Upload music" button on Play Music's website, or using the Music Manger. And if you want to edit any information in a song file, you'll have to do that from the Play Music website; you can't edit file metadata from the mobile apps.

Resend activation e-mail Technology Lab / Information Technology Comcast will offer $70 gigabit Internet in Chicago after all [Updated] Initially, Comcast said it wouldn't match $70 price in non-Google Fiber city. by Jon Brodkin - Aug 19, 2016 3:37 pm UTC Login to bookmark 154 Comcast UPDATE: About three hours after this story published, Comcast told us that the $70 gigabit Internet offer is available in Chicago, contrary to what the company told us this morning. While Comcast didn't promote the $70 price, a spokesperson now tells us customers can get the lower rate on Comcast's website. The deal is $70 for gigabit download speeds and unlimited data, and requires a three-year contract. We've changed the headline, which originally read, "Comcast's $70 gigabit offer is only good in cities with Google Fiber." Obviously, this changes things dramatically, but this is the story as we wrote it before receiving the new information: When Comcast launched its gigabit cable service in Atlanta and Nashville earlier this year, the company offered a $70 monthly price for customers who sign three-year contracts, half off the no-contract "every-day" price. But when Comcast announced gigabit Internet for parts of Chicago this week, the no-contract price of $139.95 was the only one mentioned. The difference, as DSLReports wrote today, is that there's no Google Fiber providing competition in Chicago yet. While Google Fiber has tentative plans to expand to Chicago, its $70 gigabit Internet service is already available in parts of Atlanta and Nashville. Comcast's Chicago announcement said the company "will test promotional pricing during the trial period," but didn't name any specific offers that are better than the $140 no-contract price. When contacted by Ars, a Comcast spokesperson said there is "nothing to announce at this time." The Chicago service may also come with a 1TB monthly data cap, as Comcast has previously only provided unlimited data to gigabit customers who sign a three-year contract. Otherwise, unlimited data costs $50 a month extra. AT&T has taken a similar approach to its gigabit Internet pricing, matching Google's $70 price in cities where both companies operate and charging an additional $40 elsewhere. (UPDATE: It turns out AT&T has changed the price to $90, or $20 more than Google Fiber.) AT&T's lowest price requires opting into a system that tracks your Internet browsing history in order to deliver personalized ads. Unlike Google Fiber and AT&T's GigaPower fiber service, Comcast's gigabit cable doesn't offer symmetrical speeds. New DOCSIS 3.1 (Data over Cable Service Interface Specification) technology dramatically increases download speeds, but the Comcast offering is just 35Mbps upstream. Comcast does have a symmetrical 2Gbps residential Internet service that uses fiber, but it costs $300 a month, with installation and activation fees of up to $1,000. Google Fiber, meanwhile, has been re-evaluating its expansion plans as it considers whether to use high-speed wireless technology instead of fiber.

AT&T Inc, Google parent Alphabet Inc, Apple Inc, Verizon Communications Inc and Comcast Corp are among the members of the 'Robocall Strike Force,' which will work with the U.S. Federal Communications Commission.  The group was holding its first meeting with the FCC on Friday. More than 30 major technology companies are joining the U.S. government to crack down on automated, prerecorded telephone calls.  THE ROBOCALL SCOURGE  Hundreds of thousands of people are thought to have suffered from the calls, particularly from personal protection insurance and accident claims companies.  The strike force will report to the commission by Oct. 19 on 'concrete plans to accelerate the development and adoption of new tools and solutions,' said AT&T Chief Executive Officer Randall Stephenson, who is chairing the group. The group hopes to put in place Caller ID verification standards that would help block calls from spoofed phone numbers and to consider a 'Do Not Originate' list that would block spoofers from impersonating specific phone numbers from governments, banks or others. FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler in July urged major companies to take new action to block robocalls, which often come from telemarketers or scam artists.

Share this article Share 55 shares 'This scourge must stop,' Wheeler said on Friday, calling robocalls the No. 1 complaint from consumers. Wheeler has said robocalls continue 'due in large part to industry inaction.' 'The bad guys are beating the good guys with technology,' Wheeler said. Stephenson emphasized 'the breadth and complexity' of the robocall problem. 'This is going to require more than individual company initiatives and one-off blocking apps,' Stephenson said.  'Robocallers are a formidable adversary, notoriously hard to stop.' The FCC does not require phone providers to offer robocall blocking and filtering but has strongly encouraged providers to offer those services at no charge to consumers. The strike force brings together carriers, device makers, operating system developers, network designers and the government. 'We have to come out of this with a comprehensive play book for all of us to go execute,' Stephenson said.  'We have calls that are perfectly legal, but unwanted, like telemarketers and public opinion surveyors. At the other end of the spectrum, we have millions of calls that are blatantly illegal.' Stephenson said technical experts representing the companies have had 'preliminary conversations about short- and longer-term initiatives.' Other companies taking part include Blackberry Ltd, British Telecommunications Plc, Charter Communications Inc, Frontier Communications, LG Electronics Inc, Microsoft Corp, Nokia Corp , Qualcomm Inc, Samsung Electronics Co Ltd , Sirius XM Holdings Inc, T-Mobile US Inc and U.S. Cellular Corp.

Google Maps data for China is slightly off due to the country's numerous border disputes with other nations. By Mary-Ann Russon August 19, 2016 16:18 BST Google Maps, together with many other mapping services, are displaying inaccurate information about China in order to help the country preserve its national securityGoogle If a whim takes you to look at China's geography online, you'd be better off avoiding Google Maps, because the information is likely to be slightly off. A river that appears out of nowhere, a border between India and China that is completely different on Indian and world maps, or simply roads that just don't seem to where they should be. You would think that getting a map right would be a piece of cake today with satellite GPS systems and the advent of Google Earth, but for once, the problem has nothing to do with the internet giant. The reason why maps of China are so odd is because the Chinese government considers geographic information about the People's Republic of China to be a matter of national security, so private surveying and mapping activities are illegal in mainland China and have been since 2002. If anyone wants to publish any geographic data concerning the country's air, land and waters, or data relating to any territories that the Chinese government feels is under its jurisdiction, then they must first obtain permission or they will be punished with a fine. In fact, over the last eight years China has fought at least 40 cases of illegal mapping and surveying and issued fines against everyone from Japanese and Korean academic researchers to UK geology students from Imperial College London and all the way up to massive conglomerates like Coca Cola. To that end, if you take your snazzy new digital camera to China and take a picture, when you look at the photo's metadata, you will find almost no location information available, and the only way that any online map provider can have a complete map of China is if they agree to host the data on servers inside China, and if they agree to use a very specific coordinate system. Deliberately inaccurate state-approved coordinate systems For some bizarre reason, a road and most of a river is missing from near the China-India border at Arunachal Pradesh in the Google China map (top), compared to the Google US map (bottom)screenshot by IBTimes UK Digital map services in China use a very specific coordinate system called a geodetic datum that has been specially formulated by the Chinese State Bureau of Surveying and Mapping called GCJ-02. What this means is that an encryption algorithm has been added to the maps to add random offsets to both the correct altitude and longitude of any geographic coordinates. So if you were to look at a Google street map for a specific place in mainland China, the coordinates of the map are offset by between 50-500m away from reality. This doesn't mean that maps are inaccurate within China and that people are constantly walking around scratching their heads however – it's just inaccurate if you look at it from outside the country, the local street map would be accurate, and this is the same with Yahoo Maps as well. And it isn't just restricted to urban and rural areas in the country. If you zoom out and look at the territory of China as a whole, the borders between China and other nations also differ from the same borders details on other maps, such as the crowdsourced OpenStreetMap, which publishes correct coordinates in direct opposition to the government's mandate. That's my territory, not yours Who owns the South China Sea? According to the Chinese government, it does [click to expand]World Defence Review China is currently involved in disputes with eight countries about 14 territories over its correct territorial boundaries, the most of any country in the world, and so the Chinese government is also touchy about any maps that don't reflect the boundaries that it believes in. In fact, as pointed out by statistical blog Metrocosm, if you were to look at the Chinese version of a map of south-east Asia, it looks like China owns pretty much all of the South China Sea, including almost all of the waters around Malaysia, Vietnam and the Philippines, which affects a number of disputed islands, such as the Scarborough Shoal, which the Philippines maintains belongs to them. Google already has enough trouble with dealing with China over its search engine, so mapping is clearly not an area that it wants to go to battle with the Chinese government over, but following numerous complaints by Filipinos, Google did cave in 2015. China calls the landmass Huangyan Island, while the Philippines knows it as the Panatag Shoal. To avoid legitimising either country's claims, Google changed the maps to remove the Chinese name and instead renamed the island Scarborough Shoal, which is its international name.

In the inaugural “Robocall Strike Force” meeting, the companies will announce their initial plans on how to stop US phone owners from receiving advertorial spam run by automated machines … The AT&T CEO said the 33 companies, which includes tech smartphone giants Google and Apple, will work on solutions to present a concrete plan by October 19 in a couple of months time. Right now, there are no details on what methods the companies have in mind to combat the spam phone calls, or what role Google will play. There is a possibility Google could add technology into Android that can detect robotic spam callers before the user picks up the phone. Although a plan is to be expected by October 19, a prospective date for implementation of the scheme is even more fuzzy. AT&T chairman and CEO Randall Stephenson will make the announcement at the first “Robocall Strike Force” meeting at the FCC later on Friday, the company said. FCC chairman Tom Wheeler in July wrote major companies about robocalls. The strike force will report to the commission by Oct. 19 on “concrete plans to accelerate the development and adoption of new tools and solutions,” Stephenson said. “Accelerate the development and adoption” gives no promises about when such changes could come into effect, likely taking many months or years for 33 companies to coordinate with each other. At this stage, it’s not even clear how the stakeholders would achieve such a feat: just like email spam, combatting phone spam is a cat and mouse game. blog comments powered by Disqus Submit a Tip cancel Submitting a tip constitutes permission to publish and syndicate.

Seth Weintraub - 3 months ago @llsethj Feature Samsung review Galaxy Note 7 View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit Admittedly, I haven’t had enough time with the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 to be able to get used to it as a daily driver. As with all of the other reviews including Dom’s, we’re under a week in over here. But that doesn’t mean this thing hasn’t blown me away in a lot of respects. Nor does it mean that it is flawless. Today is the first day you can pick it up at Verizon, T-Mobile, Sprint and AT&T in the US and through your favorite retailers, and I know a lot of you have itchy trigger fingers. The question: Should you get this smartphone? The short answer is yes…if… If you are considering the Note 7, you’ve already come to terms with the price which is just about the most expensive thing you can buy in Android-land at almost $900. You probably view the stylus as an advantage. You probably like your phones big – although comparatively, this is the smallest big phone you can find. That slippery curved display is worth it for the extra features, and let’s just be honest here, the wow factor when you show other people. And probably most importantly, you are OK with Samsung’s app ecosystem, the Touchwiz overlay and the carrier add-ons that inevitably come with it. I’m not yet with you there on the last point. I’m still in the Nexus camp when it comes to software. I like the latest OS, clean and simple with only Google apps on the phone by default. Of course Google has been making it easier and easier to get that look and feel with Now and new Nexus launchers and other refinements available through the Play Store. Those are about all of the big caveats I can think of after a few days with the new Note 7. The perhaps one other is that there is a new HTC Nexus phone coming soon that might have some surprise Google features that we haven’t heard about. But I wouldn’t count on it being more whiz bang than the Note 7. The Note 7 is a gorgeous, ‘friends stop what they are doing and take notice’ type of phone. As with the S7, the Note 7s combination of curved glass and microscopic bezels is unlike almost anything out there. Even iPhone owners take notice, just like a Samsung Line-waiters commercial. My biggest beef with Samsung’s S7 is that it still uses a Micro-USB port. While I still have tons of those legacy cables, I’ve moved my desk, car, bedside, batteries, etc. to USB-C so having the S7 is a throwback. We’re now a USB-C society (even Chromebooks and MacBooks use it) and with the Note 7, Samsung is finally now on board. Samsung also included a Fast Charge wireless charger in my review package and it works really well in either portrait or landscape mode. Both charging by USB-C and wireless is super fast, and between fast/easy charging and the 3500mAh battery (x 5V=17.5Wh) battery, this thing is always charged. On battery alone, I had little problem lasting a full day even with heavy usage. Another standout feature on the Note 7 is the Iris scanner which works well but with the fingerprint scanner feels a little redundant. It works better and better –or should I say faster and faster – the more you use it and even works in dark rooms or with glasses on. But if you are pushing the home button anyway, the almost instant fingerprint scanner seems tough to beat in terms of convenient security methods. When it comes to the stylus, I tend to agree with the late great Steve Jobs. I just don’t use it. I can always type faster, especially on the S7’s great keyboard (and the Google Keyboard I replaced it with). Adding words to images and signing my name can be done with my finger just as easy and frankly the process of removing the pen removes any convenience factors the S-Pens adds. However, in limited usage, the now more accurate, smaller tip pen that comes with the Note 7 is fantastic and for those who rely on a stylus, this will be one of the best they’ve used. One thing I wasn’t quite prepared for is how small this big display phone is. Since the screen for intents and purposes spans the whole width, and the chrome on the top and bottom is minimal, this phone is significantly smaller than the Nexus 6 and 6P for instance. It even makes the iPhone 6/s Plus with its much more chrome on all sides seem like a generation or two older. I’m not a fan of the choice of rear material – Gorilla Glass. Besides adding weight to the already dense Note 7, it is breakable and it feels like it gets smudges within seconds of using. Most people will put a case on here but I have to question that decision. The software experience is exactly what you’d expect. Samsung takes Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow and puts a bunch of its apps, its overlay and its way of doing things on top. If you are used to this, it is probably not a big deal. For those of us who switch phones often, moving through the OS and finding the right setting can be a hassle. Taking advantage and getting used to Samsung’s add-ons also becomes tedious and something that will come with time. I’ve resolved to try to get used to these this time around. I’ll try Samsung Pay in the coming weeks and maybe even get that S-Pen going. But for now, they don’t enter into my daily needs. Samsung has loaded up plenty of speed with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 and the 4GB of RAM means plenty of apps and browser windows can coexist well. You know the Note 7 is going to be snappy just like you know it is going to have the best camera and best display. Maybe one of the biggest sleeper advantages of the Note 7 is the storage. Mine came standard with 64GB but for $200, you can buy a 256GB MicroSD card to bring the total available storage to a whopping 320GB. If you take 4K video, this becomes a necessity. Wrap up: The smartphone market has matured and every new release no longer has to have a whiz-bang, killer new features. Samsung however has become the Android flagship standard-bearer of the high-end “new”with its Galaxy line, and the Note 7 is the latest and greatest in that family. It is the best you can buy in so many ways. These things aren’t really up for debate: Best Camera. Best screen. Most storage. One of the fastest OS experiences. Sleek, head-turning design. S-Pen Stylus is probably the best pen computing experience you’ll find on a smartphone. It is easily the best Android device you can buy and many believe the best smartphone of any kind. But damn, it is expensive. At close to $1000 retail, that’s up to three times as expensive as the new budget Android flagships that cut one corner or another. Even a Nexus 6P can be found under $400.  The carriers will take some of the edge off by subsidizing the cost and making the upfront fee a more palatable $350. But that Samsung/Carrier experience means you won’t get Android updates as fast as Nexus, you’ll be paying out the wazoo every month and you may not like the extras that get added. Which means there are still compromises to consider. Choose wisely.

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Google Duo now available worldwide, No. 1 in Play Store’s Top Charts By R Padla - August 19, 2016 1 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter We’ve been waiting for the Google Duo and Allo ever since they were announced a few months ago at the Google I/O 2016. We knew then it would be more of a video calling app, separate from Hangouts. It’s for the mobile users who want to video chat instead of just type a message. Before the release, we learned it might be set as default on Android 7.0 Nougat. The Duo video calling app rolled out earlier this week for both Android and iOS not only in the United States but in all countries. In fact, after only a few days of release, it’s now the No. 1 app in the Play Store as reported by Justine Uberti, Google Principal Engineer who was technical lead for Duo and co-leader for Allo. Duo is now available worldwide for both iOS and Android in the Top Free Charts section–ranking ahead of Facebook Messenger, Pokemon GO, Facebook, Snapchat, YouTube Music, and Instagram. More people are expected to download the app over the weekend and especially since after we learned that the Duo app will soon support audio-only calls. The last bit of news is exciting because we have another option for making free calls. There’s no need for those videos when you only want to make quick calls for free. No need to use up your current cellular limit because Duo allows free audio calls between two persons.

Here are a few simple tips for avoiding the wrong apps when you go looking for new ones. By Brandon Vigliarolo | August 19, 2016, 6:08 AM PST RSS Comments Facebook Linkedin Twitter More Email Print Reddit Delicious Digg Pinterest Stumbleupon Google Plus Google has a notoriously lax app approval process. There are some positives to allowing easy access to the Play store, but Google's attitude has also left their app store full of dangerous, device-hijacking software. More about Mobility CIO Jury: 10 out of 12 tech leaders trust Samsung despite Galaxy Note7 failure IBM Watson is coming to the iPhone, and that's big news for business users Tech Pro Research: Social media policy Subscribe to TechRepublic's Mobile Enterprise newsletter Malicious Android apps usually try to pass themselves off as other legitimate apps, which can leave the average user unable to tell the difference between the two. Here are some tips to help you distinguish the good from the bad. 1. Who's the developer? Every app's page features the developer in plain view directly beneath the name of the app. You might not know offhand who the legitimate developer of an app is, but if the name sounds fishy, is spelled wrong, or isn't capitalized properly you need to investigate further. To check into a developer scroll all the way to the bottom of an app's page on the Play store. Down at the bottom is a link to the developer's website—give it a click to make sure it goes to a legitimate site. SEE: Android Security Bulletin August 2016: What you need to know (TechRepublic) A little above the website link you'll see more apps the developer has published. Those other apps are a good indicator of who you're dealing with—be sure it's not just a bunch of copies of other apps or other junk. Popular apps are some of the most frequently scammed and copied. If you're planning to install one of those keep an eye out for the Google Top Developer icon next to the app developer's name. It appears like a small blue diamond, and it lets you know you're dealing with the right people. 2. Check permissions You can see what permissions an app will need right at the bottom of the screen near the link to the developer's website. All apps need at least some permissions in order to run, and while some need more than others, the permissions an app is asking for should match its function. If you're installing a game it might need to access the internet to pull down data, but there's no good reason for it to attach to your social media, or access your dialer or contacts. It also shouldn't be asking for control over network connections, or to be given access to install other apps. When in doubt trust an app that asks for the least amount of permissions possible. The more it wants the more it's going to worm its way into your phone. 3. What are other users saying? Check the ratings on an app: if it only has a couple stars it probably isn't worth your time, so just pass it up. SEE: Why haven't we seen the smartphone security apocalypse in iPhone and Android yet? (TechRepublic) Make sure you read the comments too—users will report on bad apps, so scan through what people are saying about it. That's not to say that malware developers don't spam the Play store with fake reviews—keep an eye out for five star review after five star review that describe nothing and read in similar ways. Other things you can do Inspecting an app on the Play store can generally distinguish the good from the bad, but there are other things you can do to keep your device safe. Be sure that you disable app installations from unknown sources. Casual Android users probably won't ever have a reason to sideload an APK, so turning it off can protect you from apps outside the Play store. Open Settings, tap on Lock Screen And Security, and look for Unknown Sources. Toggle that off and you'll be all set. Also be sure to install an Android antivirus app. They can detect bad apps and help you get rid of them, as well as protect you from malicious websites and other things that can harm you and your device. The 3 big takeaways for TechRepublic readers Investigate every app you want to install. Be sure the developer is legitimate, the comments are positive, and the app isn't asking for atypical permissions. Disable unknown app sources to prevent a website from secretly installing apps. Make sure you have an Android security app installed on your phone. They do work and can save you a lot of trouble over one simple mistake.

Vetr Crowd Thinks AMD Is Running Hot Cisco, HPE View: Overseas Cash Trumps Cautious Outlooks (Investor's Business Daily) Uber may be the current leader in the autonomous driving race, as its customers can hail a fully automated, self-driving Volvo AB (ADR) (OTC: VOLVY) SUV in a pilot project that will start this month. On the other hand, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) and its Google unit are still working on their own autonomous driving vehicle. Google had actually begun working on autonomous cars before the concept of Uber even existed. So how is it that Uber, a much smaller upstart, is beating the behemoth Google in the category? According to Recode, this is a question that Google and its employees are asking themselves. Related Link: Uber's Goal: Replace 1 Million Human Drivers With Robot Drivers ASAP Recode took a shot at answering why Google has been a "laggard to new rivals" in the space. First, Google devoted itself toward making a fully driverless car, which is a "far more difficult feat" given a lack of a steering wheel and other characteristics of a traditional car. Second, Google is in no hurry to rush a product to the market as it doesn't need a new revenue stream to support its business. By comparison, Uber's CEO Travis Kalanick was quoted by Bloomberg as saying autonomous driving vehicles were "basically existential for us." Third, Google may have trouble finding auto partners as manufacturers are skeptical of the type of data and control Google demands as part of an agreement. In the meantime, Google still holds an advantage over Uber and others in areas including machine intelligence, maps and not to mention its Android platform, which serves as a "capacity to distribute software for self-driving cars."

AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson is leading the group, and is expected to speak during a half-hour session that’s open to the public. Wheeler, Republican Commissioner Ajit Pai and Democratic Commissioner Mignon Clyburn also plan to speak. Clyburn will call for changes that make a real difference for consumers, according to remarks shared with MT. “The commission has a long history of prohibiting abusive or anticompetitive use of call-blocking technology, but consumers want real relief, and I am optimistic that beginning with today’s conversation, we will be able to deliver to consumers the change they are clamoring for.” Story Continued Below UBER SUIT SETTLEMENT REBUFFED — A California judge Thursday rejected the company’s settlement in the class-action lawsuit over drivers’ employee status. U.S. Judge Edward Chen held the settlement, valued at up to $100 million, was not equitable to drivers, who had initiated the suit to argue for employee status and reimbursement of expenses like fuel and car repairs. The settlement continues to classify drivers as independent contractors, but the final amount fell far short of the $850 million in potential damages that plaintiffs argued could have been recouped. Uber has said it sees the final number as reasonable. Attorney Shannon Liss-Riordan, representing the drivers, said the sides can reach terms that would satisfy Chen, per Reuters: “But if not, as I’ve said before, I will take the case to trial and fight my hardest for the Uber drivers,” she said. — Uber plans to start testing self-driving vehicles with passengers in the back — a move that has government bodies that regulate autonomous vehicles looking ahead to next steps. Uber’s pilot program, announced Thursday, is slated to begin in Pittsburgh in a few weeks. Implementing this trial didn't require much regulatory maneuvering since drivers will still be present, says Kurt Myers, deputy secretary for driver and vehicle services at the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation. “Current law under the vehicle code allows the operation of the motor vehicle as long as there is a licensed driver in the driver’s seat,” Myers tells MT. “So what Uber is doing is perfectly permissible.” The major regulatory question that’s on the horizon centers on experimental testing when there are no drivers in the vehicle. In that case, “there would have to be a law change,” says Myers. — In anticipation of that step, PennDOT’s autonomous vehicle taskforce is establishing a framework that prioritizes safety and forces companies to clarify key attributes about how their vehicles work, says Roger Cohen, the agency’s policy director. This framework is designed to work in concert with guidance DOT is expected to issue this month or next that will leave room for states to craft their own legislation on the subject. Companies will likely approach potential legislation in two ways, says Bryant Walker Smith, a law professor and autonomous vehicle expert at the University of South Carolina. “Some companies ... would deploy these vehicles without seeking immediate legal changes,” he says; “others might be more conservative ... and push for modifications to the federal motor vehicle safety standards that are arguably incompatible with some self-driving vehicles.” Missy Cummings, an engineering professor at Duke, says Uber’s move isn’t a huge departure from past testing: “This is exactly what Google was doing five years ago; the only real difference is that they are letting your everyday user ride around in the back.” GOOD FRIDAY MORNING!

The 21st Century Industrial Park: The newest installment of POLITICO Magazine's "What Works" series explores how Milwaukee — once described as an economically decaying "ugly, rust-colored lesion on the state’s midsection” — turned its moribund industrial district into a center for 21st century manufacturing by restoring the area’s ecological health.

CCIA'S ALTERNATIVE TO THE ALTERNATIVE ON SET-TOP BOXES — CCIA, the Google and TiVo-backed tech advocacy group, has submitted a new pitch to the FCC on how to move forward with boosting competition among cable-box makers. The group says its proposal takes a page out of the FCC's concept and the apps plan backed by the cable industry, suggesting the two approaches could be merged by allowing third-party devices to display content through their own viewing experiences and using "digital certificates" to ensure third-party cable boxes protect programmers’ content and follow FCC rules. "Concerns raised by [opponents of the FCC proposal] can be addressed utilizing existing technologies and practices with respect to certification. Privacy, advertising, copyright and security issues can be remedied through a forward-looking solution that preserves and promotes a competitive marketplace for consumers to access the content they have paid for,” the paper states: http://bit.ly/2bFrNEi. The FCC, remember, has been weighing the cable industry apps plan for several weeks to determine if it wants to incorporate all or part of it into its set-top box proposal. DESPITE ENCRYPTION QUIBBLES, TECHIES WANT CLINTON — An interesting thing about Wired: the tech-focused magazine had never previously backed a presidential candidate in its quarter century of publication. “Today we will,” Wired Editor-in-Chief Scott Dadich wrote in his endorsement of Hillary Clinton, who has been picking up support from corners of the tech community that traditionally stay out of politics. “WIRED sees only one person running for president who can do the job: Hillary Clinton.” But, Dadich cautioned: “We don’t always agree with Clinton. ... Her specific position on encryption is tough to pin down, but she seems to favor encryption weak enough for law enforcement to penetrate. That violates basic privacy. But having met Clinton and talked about all these issues with her, I can tell you that her mastery of issues and detail is unlike that of any politician I’ve met.” The vote of confidence comes on the heels of a first-of-its-kind political fundraiser at the hacker conference Black Hat, which featured Jeff Moss, founder of the historically apolitical event, stumping for Clinton. FCC AUCTION TRACKER — Bids reached nearly $10.6 billion after the third day of bidding in the forward auction closed Thursday, according to the FCC’s auction tracking site. The agency denied requests from rural telecom companies to suspend bidding after they argued that September wireless conferences and meetings conflicted with the auction, reports Margaret. “In light of all the circumstances here, we find that allowing for attendance at the associations’ September conferences and meetings does not justify suspending or reducing the ... bidding schedule,” Margaret Wiener, the auctions and spectrum access division chief for the bureau, wrote in a letter conveying the FCC’s position.

ICYMI: TWITTER SUSPENDS 235,000 TERRORISM-RELATED ACCOUNTS — The company announced Tuesday it had shut down 235,000 terrorism-related accounts between February and August. These suspensions bring the total number that have been closed to 360,000 since the middle of last year. "Our response time for suspending reported accounts, the amount of time these accounts are on Twitter, and the number of followers they accumulate have all decreased dramatically," Twitter said in a blog post announcing its efforts. "We have also made progress in disrupting the ability of those suspended to immediately return to the platform." It also noted that one-third of these suspensions were “automatically” identified by the company’s internal tools. Tony has more for Pros here: http://politico.pro/2bx0glc. — Twitter’s also stepped up its content filters, an update viewed widely as an effort to help users curb online abuse. Now, all Twitter users are able to cull their notifications and mentions, so they only see the ones coming from people they follow. Additionally, the company is endeavoring to improve post “quality” by limiting messages from those that have questionable “accountable origin and behavior.” Previously, both of these options were only available to verified users. T-MOBILE, SPRINT UNVEIL UNLIMITED DATA — The two telecom bigs both announced Thursday they would be providing all customers unlimited data as part of their plans, an upgrade that comes with the tradeoff of lower video quality. In exchange for affordable price points, the plans require users to stream video in standard definition versus high definition. "Video is a huge driver of data," Roger Entner, an analyst with Recon Analytics, told CNET. “Offering video at a lower quality is the only way carriers can continue to offer unlimited data.” T-Mobile’s option is priced at $70 for the first customer, and Sprint’s is $60 — large reductions from the $95 opening cost both companies previously charged. THE MORE YOU TWEET — While you might be able to tell a lot about someone by the way they tweet, turns out the frequency of their posts could be quite revealing as well. A study from the Online Information Review Journal examined senators’ tweets from January to December 2014 and discovered that those with more extreme ideological views were likely to tweet more often, reports Vocativ. “Members on the ideological extremes do not have to rely upon their own party’s apparatus or caucus structure to communicate their ideas, which may fall outside the mainstream beliefs of congressional leadership,” the report theorizes. This hypothesis certainly holds in the presidential election as well, in which Donald Trump has leveraged Twitter to convey his views and personality. QUICK DOWNLOADS Apple Watch makers considered adding cellular data capabilities to the device’s next iteration, but it continues to consume too much battery life. It’s about time: the Federal Reserve is now on Facebook. The government agency officially established its account on Thursday, as a means of “increasing its accessibility” to the general public. Gawker.com, the media group’s flagship site, will be shut down next week, once Univision has the reins. Square signals a step forward in its European expansion, posting three new job openings across the pond on Thursday. Facebook has a desktop gaming platform in the works; it's collaborating with Unity to build an offering that’s friendly to both Apple and Android options. The New York Times is retiring its NYT Now mobile app, after it failed to gain the traction the publication hoped for. Quote of the Day: “All my (stuff) was hacked.

In the inaugural “Robocall Strike Force” meeting, the companies will announce their initial plans on how to stop US phone owners from receiving advertorial spam run by automated machines … The AT&T CEO said the 33 companies, which includes tech smartphone giants Apple and Google, will work on solutions to present a concrete plan by October 19 in a couple of months time. Right now, there are no details on what methods the companies have in mind to combat the spam phone calls, or what role Apple will play. There is a possibility Apple could add technology into iOS that can detect robotic spam callers before the user picks up the phone. Although a plan is to be expected by October 19, a prospective date for implementation of the scheme is even more fuzzy. AT&T chairman and CEO Randall Stephenson will make the announcement at the first “Robocall Strike Force” meeting at the FCC later on Friday, the company said. FCC chairman Tom Wheeler in July wrote major companies about robocalls. The strike force will report to the commission by Oct. 19 on “concrete plans to accelerate the development and adoption of new tools and solutions,” Stephenson said. “Accelerate the development and adoption” gives no promises about when such changes could come into effect, likely taking many months or years for 33 companies to coordinate with each other. At this stage, it’s not even clear how the stakeholders would achieve such a feat: just like email spam, combatting phone spam is a cat and mouse game. In iOS 10, Apple has already started along this path with a new extension point for third-party app developers that lets the phone flag up known marketers. At WWDC, Apple advertised this feature in the context of the Chinese region (where phone spam is also very high) but it works worldwide. This is what Craig Federighi is demoing at the keynote in the image above. Phone adds integration for third-party VoIP calls, voicemail transcription and a new caller ID extension for spam alerts. However, Apple has not announced any plans to provide this data itself as of yet. If customers want to take advantage of the new iOS 10 feature, they will have to download third-party apps that offer the underlying database and provide integration with the system. iOS 10 is expected to launch next month in September. We’ll bring more details to follow on Apple’s telephone spam efforts as they are announced. blog comments powered by Disqus Submit a Tip cancel Submitting a tip constitutes permission to publish and syndicate.

(Meet the man behind Sindhu's success) Olympics special site; Photo gallery "Following her sensational move against world number 6 Nozomi Okuhara in the semi-finals of the women's badminton singles, PV Sindhu was the top searched Indian athlete, followed by debut medallist Sakshi Malik," Google said.

While overall badminton and wrestling remained the top searched sports by Indians, interest in athletics and gymnastics was boosted by some thrilling performances by the players in the Olympics. "India is currently ranked 11th in the global trends in terms of searches for the 'Olympics' over the last seven days," the statement said. Indians also showed a great deal of excitement for Jamaican Sprinter and World's fastest man Usain Bolt, who remained the most searched foreign athlete on Google India. Apart from Bolt, other top searched foreign players being searched by Indians in the last three days include Chinese badminton player Lin Dan who defeated Srikanth Kidambi, Nozomi Okuhara of Japan who lost to PV Sindhu, swimming great from the US Michael Phelps and Chinese badminton player Wang Yihan. Meanwhile, people of the North Eastern states appear to be more interested in the Rio Olympics compared to other states of the country, according to an analysis by Google. Six North Eastern states - Arunachal Pradesh, Tripura, Meghalaya, Manipur, Sikkim and Nagaland - have emerged as the top six Indian states from where netizens have extensively searched Google for information on Rio Games, the Google statement said. The remaining four positions in the Top 10 list have been occupied by Goa, Puducherry, Haryana and Uttarakhand, it said.

Digital marketing platform leader Jivox today released findings from its 2016 Jivox Benchmark Report, the first study to quantifiably measure the impact of personalization on digital advertising performance. The study’s findings proved, without a doubt, that consumer engagement skyrockets when ads are personalized, yielding on average 3X the performance of standard display ads. “Personalization has fundamentally changed how marketers engage with customers, and is shifting the very foundation of the digital advertising market,” said Diaz Nesamoney, CEO of Jivox (pictured top left). “By replacing the industry’s traditional cost-per-thousand insertion model with an ‘always on’ paradigm, personalized ads offer brands significantly higher – and more predictable – revenue streams. This is a game-changing innovation for the industry with immense power to drive a business at scale.” The 2016 Jivox Benchmark Report examined more than one billion personalized ad impressions from 24 real-world ad campaigns, conducted by brands across six industries and delivered within 10 major global markets. Specifically, the study sought to quantitatively measure the impact on performance of ad campaigns delivered using real-time data signals, or triggers, in combination with first-party, audience and contextual data. Campaign performance was measured against three Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) – Click Through Rate (CTR), Interaction Rate (IR) and Average Dwell Time (ADT) – and compared to Google’s display ad benchmark for rich media, the industry standard for measuring online ad performance. Key Findings The study revealed enormous growth in consumer engagement when ads were personalized, yielding on average 3X performance gains over standard display ads: Click Through Rate. A commonly used measurement of ad performance, Click Through Rate (CTR) determines how often individuals who see an ad end up actually clicking on it. On average, the personalized digital ads from Jivox’s study delivered a CTR that was 230% higher than (or 3.3X) the Google display ad benchmark for rich media creative. Interaction Rate. Also known as Engagement Rate, the Interaction Rate (IR) measures the level of interaction while users are viewing an ad impression. The personalized ads from Jivox’s study achieved an IR that is 84% higher than (or 1.8X) the Google display ad benchmark for rich media creative. Average Dwell Time. By calculating the length of time individuals engage with an ad, Average Dwell Time (ADT) measures how successfully that ad captured user attention. A significant measurement, ADT directly correlates with an ad’s conversion rate, or its ability to achieve a desired user action. On average, the personalized digital ads from Jivox’s study achieved an ADT that is 28% higher than (or 1.3X) the Google display ad benchmark for rich media creative. “The numbers are staggering, and offer hard evidence of what up to now has been conventional wisdom among marketers: personalization drives massive performance gains in digital advertising,” said Nesamoney. “Personalized marketing certainly isn’t a new idea. But we believe brands are just on the cusp of realizing its promise with the recent emergence of modern data-driven ad technology platforms and the unprecedented availability of data to power campaigns. This is truly a new paradigm in marketing.” The Jivox report also examined six popular data “triggers” used for personalizing digital ads – Weather, Demographics, Retargeting, Geography, Language and Time – and analyzed their impact on overall ad performance. Additionally, the study revealed how data triggers impacted ad performance differently within specific vertical industries.

Wccftech News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile  ⋮  Software Google Duo 1-to-1 Video Calling App For iOS, Android Released – Direct Download Links By Uzair Ghani Posted Aug 16, 2016 42Shares Share Tweet Submit Google Duo, the 1-to-1 video calling app which the search engine giant showed off at Google I/O 2016 has been released for both iOS and Android. Google Duo Arrives For iOS & Android – Will Roll Out Worldwide In The Days To Come When it comes to video calling, Google has tried a number of times to make its formula work. But so far, the company has managed to ruffle a few feathers if not more. But at Google I/O 2016 it was fairly evident that the company has figured out how to make things work, and hence Duo’s foundation was laid down, with the company promising to release the app to the public during Summer time. Fast forward to today and Google Duo app for iOS, Android is finally available for download. And as you’d expect, it’s absolutely free. Video calling is the next best thing to being with someone in person, but too often it can be a frustrating or complicated experience. You shouldn’t have to worry about whether your call will connect, or if your friend is using the same type of device as you are. It’s no wonder that nearly half of us never make video calls on mobile*. Today, we’re releasing Google Duo — a simple 1-to-1 video calling app available for Android and iOS. Duo takes the complexity out of video calling, so that you can be together in the moment wherever you are. Advertisement Google Duo is packed with a lot of fun features that make video calling a worthwhile experience. For instance, Knock Knock gives you a glimpse of the caller even before you pick up the call so you know exactly what sort of situation you’ll be dealing with. Furthermore, things go straight through the roof when you realize Duo offers brilliant video quality that adjusts itself even on slower networks (WiFi and cellular both). Microsoft Pix Is A New Artificially Intelligent Camera App For Your iPhone Those who are into privacy a lot will be pleased to learn that calls are end-to-end encrypted. This means no one will be able to trace down your bad joke. So we’ll give Google a double thumbs up on that. Where To Download Google Duo As we mentioned above, Google Duo is available for free on both iOS and Android. But do keep in mind it might not be available in your region as the rollout is gradual. Give it a few days and everything will be there for you to try out.

For now, the functionality is still limited to only a specific collection of devices, but ahead of a wider release, Google has been slowly streamlining the experience. In the latest Canary release, M54 (via ChromeStory), Google has made some minor tweaks to the design of Chrome OS, starting with the “all apps” icon and the app tray. One of the first things you’ll notice is that the “all apps” icon has switched from the well-known grid icon to a new, very simple, circular icon. Along with that, you’ll also notice that the app tray now hosts two rows of apps rather than just one. This is undoubtedly related to Android apps as it gives users easier access to their more frequently used applications. Along with these two tweaks, Google has also changed how notifications look in Chrome OS with new notification icons on the notification tray. The cards also have a tweaked design. In bigger news, Google has also added support for background sync for apps such as Gmail. This is definitely a huge benefit for those using the app on a Chromebook as it will no longer need to be open in the background for notifications to sync. For now these changes are limited to the latest Canary update, although they should make their way to the stable channel over time, especially as more Chromebooks gain access to Android apps.

Google is beta testing a new feature there named "account health score for search." This was first spotted by Chris Whyatt at the Receptional blog. The account health score for search measures how well your search network campaigns are configured. It then comes up with a set of recommendations that can/will raise your score and help your campaigns perform better, says Google. The score is 0 out of 100%. Here is a screen shot from SEL: When you click into it, it then dives into each campaign and the recommends it offers for each campaign. So it scores each individual campaign you are running. This is pretty cool, Search Engine Land has more screen shots and a comment from Google that reads "We're pleased with how we've been able to help advertisers through the Opportunity Tab and are always testing out new features." Forum discussion at Twitter. Prev Story Next story Tweet This Previous story: Google AdWords Device Bid Adjustments Hitting AdWords Advertisers Now   Comments: Lee Wilson 08/22/2016 07:51 am Site health is an interesting topic for SEO. The industry tends to go through phases where the focus goes from high level to very minimal, depending of what else is happening in the industry at the time. The benchmark and measurement/refining/improving of site health has always been really important (certainly for the user and more evident in search success too), it just seems more people are getting on board, and this update from Google with speed that up massively. From our own research into the impact of site health on rankings (see full post at https://www.vertical-leap.uk/blog/search-lessons-one-billion-technical-website-checks/) we know that healthy website attract more links (up to 750% more!), and many other wins come form a healthy website - another example being tied to traffic gains (we discovered that the healthiest sites receive ~33% more traffic organically). blog comments powered by Disqus The pulse of the search community Subscribe Subscribe options ADVERTISERS Search buzz Video 11/18/2016 09:35 am Subscribe More videos Video Details Browse by: Browse by Date Find by Category Discover by Author Scan Most Recent See Comments View Tag Cloud SEM FORUM THREADS WebmasterWorld Forums E.U.

I was waiting for Google to say why and their answer is what I expected. Google responded in the ongoing Google AdWords Help thread that they added these restrictions with the intent of "preventing "bots" and other services from abusing the intended use of Keyword Planner." Here is the whole paragraph: This change was made so that we can consistently give advertisers the data they need to optimize their accounts, while preventing "bots" and other services from abusing the intended use of Keyword Planner. The search volume estimates, though displayed differently in some cases, still provide an accurate and helpful view of how many clicks and impressions keywords may receive. Of course, many of the folks who read this will say, well, there are plenty of ways to prevent this abuse without the restrictions they set forth on the amount an advertiser spends. But the truth is, I do believe this is why they did it. It is an easy metric to use to reduce bot usage and other types of abuse. What do you think? Forum discussion at Google AdWords Help.

LJ 08/19/2016 01:07 pm What a hunk of BS Samer El Sabeh 08/19/2016 01:44 pm Captchas can always be bypassed. I still believe that Google made the right choice here. Besides, if you're not a big spender on AdWords then I don't think it would be an issue for you. My clients spend $500k/year on AdWords. Matt 08/19/2016 02:08 pm Must not be completely rolled out. I'm not a paying customer and I can still access it. Leif Berg 08/19/2016 03:59 pm Kind of like saying the bathroom is for paying customers only. Relax everyone. The Truth 08/19/2016 04:12 pm But you can only use the bathroom if you buy the steak. Soups, salads, & sandwiches do not qualify as a bathroom purchase. Carsten Legaard 08/22/2016 02:25 pm This makes a perfect opportunity for a quick Adwords dealer to sell validation of Keywords beyond Google's reach. Shotinthefoot, it is also called Larry G. Maguire 08/22/2016 05:16 pm There's always gonna be friction when something that's been available for so long openly for free, is taken away. Personally I think it sucks and I think their explanation is BS. This is Google we're talking about here and I don't believe for a second that there was no other way to prevent bots from accessing their data. However, they are a commercial enterprise and they are entitled to do what they will with their apps. Their customers are the ones paying for services and they are who should be served first. If you've been getting access to the tool for free and now it's effectively gone, then tough titties. Time to move on. 😀 Greg Moore 09/07/2016 01:08 am "This change was made so that we can consistently give ADVERTISERS the data they need to optimize their accounts, while preventing "bots" and other services from abusing THE INTENDED USE of Keyword Planner." In other words, people who do SEO use this data. That's the "problem" they are addressing. The effect is to limit the ability of SEOs to do keyword research. This is like Not Provided. Google is implementing a decision that is too broad. It hampers the ability of people like me to make the web a better place. The Wardrobe Stylist 09/12/2016 12:58 am Totally agree! The Wardrobe Stylist 09/12/2016 01:00 am I think they slowly tear away access. At the time this article was published, I was accessing it, until last week. The change happened this weekend. The Wardrobe Stylist 09/12/2016 01:01 am Just found this article after reading your more recent one. I still believe it's to restrict it to paying customers...they're just being politically correct about it. I mean fine, you want to do that, ok, but don't give me a range for a keyword from 100K-1m! Narrow it down a little to something a little more realistic. Matthew Lake 09/15/2016 12:50 pm So if you're not already rich or have a bit of spare cash to spend, you can't do SEO? Won't this affect other programs that pull the data from google? Samer El Sabeh 09/15/2016 01:17 pm Yeah you got a point here. But there are other programs you can use for SEO like Moz's keyword explorer and many others. Simon 09/28/2016 07:44 pm Really bad news for SEO folks. I don't run AdWords campaigns but do of course need keyword data for SEO purposes. Luckily I found a great cheap Keyword Research tool.

Some in the community have issues with how Googlers respond to SEO related questions. Some have issues with how those statements are interpreted. And some have issues with how one interprets them in a 70 character title as well. All fair. Rand Fishkin, in his weekly whiteboard Friday, actually dissected some of those statements from Google in a 7-8 minute video. I wanted to share it with you: It is a touchy topic for both because you have one school of SEOs who go with what Google says, you have another school of SEOs that doubt everything Google says. Then you have those that lean each way and those who are somewhere in-between. Personally, I don't think Googlers lie. I don't think Rand feels that way either. I think how Rand laid it out, for the most part, is somewhat right. Of course, the issue is, Googlers in this position are put in tough spots where they are asked questions and sometimes they do not understand the question or the answer is misunderstood or their response is fuzzy because there is no clear way to answer it. I literally go through this every day when I cover their statements. I do try to explain what I think they mean, which sometimes gets me in trouble. But I don't think there is anyone out there who has more experience reading Google's statements as I do. Am I right? Probably not all the time, but I do try. Either way, watch Rand's video. It directly addresses much of our coverage here, since we report on Google's statements. Forum discussion at Twitter.

Am I right?" Can't Agree More With You...!!! Michael Martinez 08/19/2016 02:38 pm And he continues to misrepresent what Google says. Just as he doctored Matt's original comments about PageRank Sculpting and never acknowledged Matt's correction, Rand is ignoring the followup Matt gave about the 301 redirects passing PageRank. So this latest Moz post will be cited as an authoritative source for more misinformation. When SE Roundtable covered the change in Matt Cutts' message on 301 redirects: https://www.seroundtable.com/redirects-links-pagerank-16419.html Barry Schwartz 08/19/2016 02:41 pm :( RedN334 08/19/2016 03:48 pm Thanks for the video. I don't think the public facing Googlers lie. However, that's because they are only the spokespeople. The internal hidden programmers and executives can do whatever they like keeping secrets to themselves. Even the spokespeople have no idea about valuable secrets. Not saying this is what happens but it is a possibility. The phrase "plausible deniability" fits here somewhat. Rick 08/19/2016 04:14 pm I like the way he put it. That is pretty close to how I look at the comments from Google. Anon User 08/19/2016 04:23 pm Michael knows best Barry. You of all people should know that. Anyone who dresses up as Gandalf the Grey at weekends must be right. Right? nnn 08/19/2016 05:53 pm I think rand missed the memo on creating moz content. Larry Kim 08/19/2016 07:22 pm i just ignore them and run tests myself. data is better than anything a PR spokesperson says. (a) it's not google's job to tell you exactly how their search algos work (b) the PR spokespersons don't know all the details of how this thing works - it's not like they built any of this stuff and the current SEO PR team are all very low ranking people in the organization (c) things change (d) stuff is often omitted. (e) they often get stuff wrong (f) they're on a tight leash in terms of what they're permitted to disclose, etc. i'm blown away how otherwise smart people hang on to every word of a PR spokesperson rather than doing their own homework. ps - nice image selection, barry. Grant Simmons 08/19/2016 07:48 pm Wait a sec! You're telling me Googler's may not tell the whole truth all the time????????? Larry Kim 08/19/2016 07:51 pm lol Grant Simmons 08/19/2016 07:53 pm It's Friday Larry... quick distractions are necessary. All good? Cheers Nick Ker 08/19/2016 07:58 pm So true. It's not just SEO people and frustrated webmasters in this and other forums. I sometimes get clients who are all worked up over a 4 or 5 word tweet from Google and the hype that surrounds it. It seems like common sense to test, go with what you know, follow the damned Webmaster Guidelines, and experiment cautiously. But some will still base major business decisions on something they heard somewhere and they can't even remember who it was or where it was said. Or worse, they KNOW where they read it but are ashamed to say so because they know how unreliable it is - but they want to do that voodoo anyway! Larry Kim 08/19/2016 08:08 pm i'm also annoyed that some SEOs shamelessly kiss up to Google PR people in order to curry favor with them. like participation at a webinar or dibs on a story to get a few pageviews or leads or conference attendees. the relationship between SEO and Google PR spokesperson shouldn't be that cozy. at that point, you've lost objectivity and have sold out imho. Barry Schwartz 08/19/2016 08:11 pm I don’t think it is an us vs them. Larry Kim 08/19/2016 08:52 pm hmm.. put another way, i think the relationship between PR spokesperson and SEO should be more like how the press (in theory at least) ought to cover say, the white house, in an professional and objective manner. this isn't an us vs. them. it's more about maintaining objectivity. if you are seeking favors from the spokesperson by pandering to them, i think it compromises objectivity, as opposed to interpreting statements along the lines of what the article suggests. Michael Martinez 08/19/2016 10:27 pm It's FRODO you androgynous screen name using flamebait to participate in the ongoing discussion. RedN334 08/19/2016 10:28 pm I agree with you Larry. I do think Barry is different or he would not be covering the zombie issue. Search watch,search land, warrior, pchero, etc. I have NEVER seen a zombie story. Damon 08/20/2016 01:28 am You don't see zombie stories on those sites because they generally report on real things rather than rumors. Barry in the other hand, reports both news and whatever forums are buzzing about, no matter how unfounded it may be. That's not always a bad thing. It can be bad when people take the reporting on forum buzz as validation of that buzz though. Not Barry's fault and SER is a great source of info as well as theory. You just need to be able to tell which is which, and obviously some struggle with that. Actually haven't looked at se watch in awhile because much of their content turned to old style SEOBS when everyone and their cousin started guest blogging. SE Land and marketing land are likely the only legit search news sites anymore, with SER being a news & rumors combo. Anon User 08/20/2016 06:55 am I scored a direct hit on that raw nerve you got there Bilbo. Rands wife will be along to follow that up later with a bitch slap. Mrs Fishkin 08/20/2016 12:28 pm How very dare you. I suppose you think you are the one ring piece to bind them all. Michael Martinez 08/20/2016 01:02 pm Exactly, I don't know why Barry continues to cover SEO news when Michael already knows everything about SEO and how were all wrong. Btw Michael, even smartphones have pretty decent cameras these days, perhaps you should take a new mugshot to put on your e-turd blogs RedN334 08/20/2016 03:16 pm Zombies are not rumor but fact. There have been a ton of reports by different webmasters that are unrelated to one another. Go back to the days before Sept 2015 and pretend everything is about panda and penguin if it makes you feel good to relive the past. Michael Martinez 08/21/2016 05:33 am That's more like a self slap. I was expecting better. Anon User 08/21/2016 08:02 am It wiped that smaug look right off your face. Michael Martinez 08/21/2016 09:08 am Still smauging over here. David Leonhardt 08/21/2016 10:30 pm Grant, I don't think your comment is WCAG compliant. Let me help. NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!! I might have added a couple extra Os, but you can never have too much of a good thing, right? Grant Simmons 08/21/2016 10:54 pm Nooooooooooo you're riiiiiiiggghhhttt. Better now. Damon 08/22/2016 11:50 am A bunch of confused webmasters who don't even understand their own analytics is not proof of anything. I didn't say a thing about Panda or Penguin, but go ahead and try to change the subject if you don't feel like making a fool of yourself trying to prove a conspiracy theory again. blog comments powered by Disqus The pulse of the search community Subscribe Subscribe options ADVERTISERS Search buzz Video 11/18/2016 09:35 am Subscribe More videos Video Details Browse by: Browse by Date Find by Category Discover by Author Scan Most Recent See Comments View Tag Cloud SEM FORUM THREADS WebmasterWorld Forums E.U.

Ford is testing autonomous features using Fusions. It wants to put fully autonomous vehicles on the market by 2021. For the first time in America's industrial history, the center for automotive technology is drifting away from Detroit. Ford Motor Co., aiming to put fully autonomous vehicles into the economy by 2021, announced that it's doubling the size of its office in Silicon Valley to 260 people and investing in four companies that are key to building self-driving cars. The carmaker's move follows more than $1 billion in investments made by Detroit-based General Motors Co. in a pair of California technology companies earlier this year to keep up with Google's autonomous-car project and Uber Technologies Inc.'s ride-hailing business. While the old-school mechanical engineering remains in the Midwest as does low-skilled factory work that hasn't moved to Southern states, these investments show Detroit carmakers have realized that they must go to the nation's technology center to find the software expertise needed to make the autos of tomorrow. Traditional automakers now directly employ hundreds in Silicon Valley, which is also home to Palo Alto-based Tesla Motors Inc. "The shift to California is undeniable," said Eric Noble, president of the CarLab consulting firm in Orange, Calif. "The technological development for autonomous vehicles and intelligent cars will continue to be done in northern California because that's where the knowledge is." Ford and GM, racing to stay among the technology leaders, face a few tough realities. Companies like Google and Uber threaten to upend the industry by turning car owners and drivers into passengers who simply pay for a ride. And even though the carmakers and state of Michigan are developing tech talent, Silicon Valley is still ground zero for the people who write code, create driverless algorithms and come up with new business models for mobility. California's lure Ford has invested in Velodyne Lidar Inc., which develops the laser-based sensors that are the eyes of self-driving cars, and 3-D mapping company Civil Maps, both in California. The Dearborn-based carmaker also acquired SAIPS, an Israeli-based computer vision and artificial intelligence designer, and it reached a licensing agreement with Nirenberg Neuroscience LLC. Its founder, Sheila Nirenberg, has developed a machine-vision platform that Ford said can bring humanlike intelligence to self-driving cars. "We came to Silicon Valley — there are a lot of great places around the world — but the ecosystem here is just unbelievable," Ford CEO Mark Fields, standing outside on a bright, sunny day, said to reporters. "It's like a bazaar of ideas, and everybody's open." GM CEO Mary Barra last year took her top leaders to visit tech companies and venture capital firms to get their thoughts on fostering innovation. GM went on to buy a 9 percent stake in Lyft Inc., a competitor to Uber, for $500 million. GM also spent more than that to buy San Francisco-based Cruise Automation, which writes the software for autonomous driving. Owning Cruise, which has grown from 40 employees to 100, has helped GM hire people who may not have been interested in working for an automaker, Mike Ableson, GM's vice president of global product planning, said in a June interview. Some people want to remain the California environment but also have the stability of a large company, he said. Similarly, Ford's announcement may have been intended to present the maker of F-150 pickups look like an "exciting destination for human talent," Adam Jonas, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, said in a research note. "There is at least a perception in the market that all the cool kids are going to places like Uber," Google, Tesla or China, he wrote. Ford and other automakers "want to change this." Michigan's story Michigan isn't giving up on talent, Gov. Rick Snyder said in a June interview. Snyder, a former chairman of Gateway computers and founder of investment funds, pointed out that Alphabet Inc.'s Google announced in May that it will open a self-driving car research center in Novi and that Harman International Industries Inc., the audio and automotive technology company, opened its North American headquarters nearby. Amazon.com Inc. has opened a tech center in downtown Detroit. Snyder said one of Michigan's biggest challenges is getting the word out that it has great resources for technology companies, especially in the automotive industry. With the University of Michigan focusing on software and technology development, the talent and education system is available for any company that wants to take advantage of it, he said. The university's Mcity provides carmakers and tech companies with an ersatz town to test driverless cars. Plus the state has much lower costs of living and doing business than California, especially with real estate prices rising ever faster in Silicon Valley. "Our challenge is that we don't do particularly well with telling people," Snyder said. "That's something we should do more of, especially when it comes to talking about Detroit's comeback." While the Detroit region has bounced back, its unemployment rate is 5.8 percent compared with 4.1 percent in the San Jose, Calif. area, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Snyder in June unveiled Planet M, an advertising and marketing campaign to tell technology companies that the state has the education and industrial base to be home to new automotive technology research and startups. The tagline is, "Michigan. Where big ideas in mobility are born." To compete with the Golden State, Michigan plans to make an autonomous-drive test track out of a 330-acre industrial site near Ypsilanti, where Rosie the Riveter built B-24 bombers during World War II. One selling point: Tough winters and many potholes make the site a better proxy for the imperfect world of driving than California's decommissioned Navy base in Concord. "If you look at any place in the world, we have highly developed building blocks," Snyder said.

The app's technical lead Justin Uberti has tweeted that Duo is now the top free app. Alongside the huge accomplishment, Uberti also announced that rollout of the app is now complete, and Google Duo should now be available in all countries for free download. Google Duo sits on the top spot for free apps in Google Play US, above other popular apps like Facebook, Facebook Messenger, Instagram and YouTube Music. In India, the app sits on the sixth position with WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, ShareIt, Facebook, and UC Browser apps still in the lead. However, the app is topping the chart in the 'Top New Free', and 'Trending' sections. In the India App Store, Google Duo is topping the charts under the free section, with WhatsApp, ShareIt, Facebook and the other usual suspects falling behind it.Google Duo was first announced at I/O developers conference in May, where the tech giant promised a global rollout in a few months. In the initial stages of rollout, few users in US and Canada did complain about failed verification via SMS, but that soon got fixed, and the global rollout has now successfully been completed. (Also see:Google Duo Is Fast, Simple, and Out Now Google's new video calling app will compete with FaceTime, Skype, Viber, and others. It's a fairly simple app that lets you video call all your contacts that have the app installed on their phones. Google claims that the app works even on low strength networks. The company elaborates that the app adjusts quality of the video automatically in spotty networks to avoid hiccups in the conversation. Google Duo comes with end-to-end encryption, and also has a feature called Knock Knock which essentially shows you a preview video of the caller, before picking up the call. So instead of just the name, the video of the caller is also played at the back. Once the user picks up the call, the audio gets turned on, and the two parties can then converse easily. (Also see:Google's Allo and Duo Apps: Everything You Need to Know) Alongside Duo, Google had also announced the Allo instant messaging app for Android and iOS. The big highlights on this app are Google Assistant integration, and Smart Reply.

As a co-chair of W3C's Web Payments Working Group, Ripple comes in regular contact with big tech companies and there is "a lot of interest" from them about Ripple's Interledger Protocol (ILP). Ripple chief technical officer Stefan Thomas gave his take on this, and in the process provided some interesting strategic insights from behind the closed doors of the working group. Thomas said the likes of Google, Apple, Mozilla and others have been coming together to try to find a better user experience for payments on the web, and one of the big hindrances for that is the reliance on the card networks. Thomas told IBTimes UK: "At these forums is where we run in to them [Google, Apple etc] and we obviously notice the issues that they are having with the card networks and we think that Interledger is a really good solution. We see their interest, and the fact they keep asking us to give presentations about it. "From a sort of business strategic perspective, the big tech companies absolutely hate the card issuers, because they are another powerful player and something the big tech companies don't like is sharing market power." Thomas said the majority of the big tech players' ire is directed at Visa, which is now competing directly with PayPal, Worldpay and some other user-facing solutions with Visa Checkout. Suggesting there is not that much love in the room between these large companies is putting it mildly, he said. "The tech companies would much rather be able to move themselves. I think what they are lacking, what they need is some way to interoperate with each other. That's the thing the Visa has that they don't have, the interoperability. That's why we think having a protocol that gives them that interoperability is going to unleash complete hell on Visa." Thomas said a goal of Interledger is to create a money network that can connect cryptocurrencies, which he hopes will be done by the end of 2016 or early next year. Connecting crypto is a proving ground for ILP, he said. "By the end of the year we will hopefully have a solid integration with all the major cryptocurrencies and some traffic going through it, some real money going through it between different cryptocurrencies. We think that is the signal companies like Google are waiting for to take the next step. Then maybe we will see some adoption from tech companies as well." Some time ago Ethereum inventor Vitalik Buterin commented that he had fielded interest in blockchain from almost every sector save the big technology companies. Thomas said he has been thinking of how to articulate some of the reasons for this in his blog. "I think that blockchains are actually kind of difficult to work with and they are certainly difficult to scale; everyone who has worked with blockchain knows this. And that's the reason tech companies have largely ignored blockchain, I think. They are immediately looking for 'how efficient is this, how scalable is this' – and it just isn't there. "Perhaps the reason finance has been so open to it is that they are used to fairly arcane and complex systems, so they have a higher tolerance to that. "Now I think Interledger is a lot closer to the web protocol. It's much more like HTTP than it is like Bitcoin and so it has that sort of lightweight efficiency." Thomas explained that ILP is modelled like the internet; a routing algorithm runs on top that can essentially reach from any ledger to any other ledger just by finding the series of hops that connect the two in the network. As well as connecting blockchains, it can provide interoperability for any type of ledger, so for centralised systems as well. He said one of the most important design goals in the Interledger Protocol is that you are only exposed to risk from the ledger you are on. "You are not exposed to any risk from either the connectors, which are the systems that connect ledgers, or any of the other ledgers. The way that we do that is by using escrow at each hop of the payment. "So for instance, if you are on Bitcoin you would be putting money in escrow and then you get proof that the ultimate recipient has received your money. That is basically proof that the recipient has to provide, then the money is released to whichever connector that you chose." "If we look at the connectors in between, they are basically sitting between two ledgers, which they have to trust anyway because they need money on both. They see the same condition on both sides of them; they see the same condition for the money coming in, as for the money going out. "All they need to do is take the fulfilment of that condition – whatever signature it is or hash – they take that and pass it on to the other ledger. That's how our Interledger Protocol works."

It’s very long, but I've broken it down for you into digestible bites. There is also a quick rundown of symptoms and diagnoses for you on the last page, so feel free to skip to that page if you're in a hurry. So let's start at the beginning. I have spent numerous hours on Google trying to find answers to my questions about mold symptoms. If you came across this post from a Google search, you are probably experiencing some of the suffering that I have gone through. As a nurse, I never felt more uneducated and flat out stupid than I have during this time. Nothing could prepare you for the deadly living conditions in which toxic mold can provide to humans. There is mold all around us, I realize that. It’s in our homes and everywhere outside. However, there are certain forms of fungus that can be lethal to our body systems. The scariest part is that many people are unaware that they are living in a mold infested home. I was one of them. I was not aware of our mold problem for at least 1 year. I became a first time mother in May of 2011. Up until I delivered my son, I was a healthy, energetic 25-year-old woman. I had no medical issues other than seasonal allergies. Once my son was born, we bought a washing machine to "make my life easier." We had trouble frequently with our used washer and dryer so we thought that purchasing a brand new set would be ideal, especially with a new baby. Right. This washing machine broke several times and flooded our entire kitchen floor, causing extensive damage. However, we weren’t aware of how serious the damage actually was until about a year later when the washer broke for about the fifth time. After the repairman left (it was under warranty and all repairs were free), I noticed a pool of water in the basement. Our washer sat beside the dryer in the kitchen, which is on the first floor of the home. Then, I saw the mold. Black mold and mushrooms covered a vast majority of our basement ceiling. The heaviest of spots was where the washer and dryer sat. There was also damage done around the bathtub and kitchen sink, which I was told the water pooled there because of how heavy they are. We had a mold test done and they found stachybotrys in our home, along with tons of other molds. Stachybotrys is the famous, "toxic black mold," that no home owner wants in their house. This is a picture of the day that I noticed the black mold at the washer and dryer: When you get a test done from a reputable company, you will be given a diagnostic report of each mold, the percentage that was identified in your home, and maybe even the risk factors that go along with it. From my personal experience, I can say with 100% confidence that living in a moldy environment caused and exacerbated a load of different symptoms. I was a normal, healthy individual prior to being exposed to black mold. The only medication I took was birth control pills and a prenatal vitamin. I did suffer from depression periodically but thought I had that under control, which is a post all in itself. So what were my symptoms? Allergies It all started with a sinus infection, which wasn’t out of the ordinary for me. I was used to getting a sinus infection once a year, like clockwork. However, this sinus infection would not go away. My early symptoms were the textbook mold/allergy symptoms: runny nose, cough, sneezing, fullness in the head, headache, etc. I was given antibiotics twice until I gave up and started popping Zyrtec like they were a multivitamin. Fatigue I have never experienced anything like the fatigue I had when living in a moldy home. The fatigue that I experienced wasn’t me just being tired and lazy, because I am not that kind of person. I was always active, loved the outdoors, exercising, and borderline ADD. I always had to be on the go. Then, I was overcome with pure physical and mental debilitating exhaustion. So, I went to the doctor to get put back on Phentermine, a weight loss drug. Phentermine is an appetite suppressant and is also an amphetamine, which will give you that hyper, jittery, energetic rush. After a year of breastfeeding, I was ready to go back on this miracle energy drug. I was probably borderline overweight. I gained about 5-10 lbs after I stopped breastfeeding and it wouldn’t have hurt to lose any weight so my doctor agreed to prescribe it for me again. My doctor also scheduled routine blood work and found that I was slightly hypothyroid. I began taking Synthroid and continued on it for a year. At each regular well-check, I would complain of fatigue. It’s common to have fatigue with hypothyroidism. However, when your levels are stable, you’re supposed to feel better. I never did. So, since I was now at a healthy weight, my doctor suggested that I stay on Phentermine for the fatigue. I agreed, even though the Phentermine only helped with the energy shortly after taking it. I was desperate and didn’t want to lose my only saving grace of 10 minutes of energy. I also wasn’t mentally capable of thinking of a different option. My entire brain felt clouded and confused and all that I wanted to do was sleep. Female Problems A month or so after discovering my hypothyroidism, I had a pap done and it came back slightly abnormal. My GYN told me that it was probably a bacterial infection and gave me some medication to treat it. Well, it went away. One month later, however, I started getting symptoms of a bacterial infection and called her for more medication. I got a bacterial infection monthly for over a year and a half. My doctors kept telling me that "some people just get these frequently." I never believed that and still don’t. I never had one before, so I began thinking there was something wrong with me. Another odd thing was that I did not have a period since before I got pregnant. I breastfed my son for one year after having him. Then, I began spotting each month and that was it. Along with each "period," I would have a bacterial infection, which was not your typical yeast infection. I was also told to try RePhresh, to help prevent the infection for occurring. I tried that several times and had no luck. Honestly, I think it made it worse. There was clearly something wrong and I knew it in my gut. Doctors refused to listen, and I began thinking maybe it was just me. I mean, who am I to second guess their medical expertise? What this taught me was to always trust your gut. Because there were more symptoms to come. Flu-like During this time, I came down with a physical debilitating illness of some sort. I felt numb inside and out, dizzy, short of breath, and extremely drowsy. I remember it vividly because it was around Christmas time last year. I wasn’t even in the mood to shop for presents, which is SO unlike me. I didn’t even buy my husband anything and that is still eating at me, as it should. I also became very nauseated, especially at night. I took numerous pregnancy tests month after month and they always came back negative thankfully. I say "thankfully" because there was no way that my body could have carried a child and delivered a healthy baby throughout living in this. Plus, I wasn’t mentally prepared to handle another child and we financially couldn’t afford another one, especially since I was working from home part-time. Cough In January, I was a mess. I was working from home and doing a below-average job as a freelance writer because I couldn’t mentally concentrate. My brain felt like it had a thick fog blended in it. My body ached, my head hurt, I had dark circles under my eyes, was always freezing, and had a cough like a chain smoker (and I’ve been a non-smoker my entire life). It was the worst at night and felt like something was lodged in my throat. And then came the dental issues. Oral/Dental I have had SO many odd dental problems since living in a home with toxic black mold. It’s common to have allergic responses in your oral cavity but this was a first time for me. One day I felt some pain in my lower jaw, right below my ear. I rubbed it and felt a soft, swollen lump. As I rubbed it, a funky taste squirted into my mouth. It tasted like metal or infection. So, I called my family doctor and she prescribed me an antibiotic. A few hours after taking the first antibiotic, I felt like I needed to go to the hospital. I have no known allergies and have never had issues with antibiotics in my life. But as soon as I took this medicine, my brain felt like it was expanding through my skull. My heart began pounding and I started shaking. I called my doctor, who instructed that I stop the medicine and try another one. I refused. I had been on way too many antibiotics and nothing was helping. Things were getting far worse. My bottom teeth crowded together one morning after I felt my teeth aching. The pain wasn’t anything new; I had been experiencing it frequently along with clenching my jaw at night and dreaming of having my teeth knocked out. However, I had braces for 5+ years and flipped out when my teeth moved. They felt loose, as if they were about to fall out. Luckily, that hasn’t happened yet. Cold Sores I got cold sores that last for weeks at a time. They were the most painful, intense cold sores I have ever had. Sometimes they were all white, other ones appeared to be your traditions cold sores. They also bled. Swollen Salivary Glands My salivary glands made the inside of my cheeks pucker. You can see a tiny black dot on top frequently, which is the clogged gland. Thyroid Nodule I scheduled an appointment with an Ear, Nose, and Throat doctor because we do not have dental insurance. First, they wanted to do an ultrasound of my thyroid. My ultrasound showed that I had a 3 cm calcified nodule. Next, they recommended a biopsy and informed me that there was a good chance it was cancer because of the calcification. Thankfully, it came back negative for cancer. However, I have to get an ultrasound done yearly now to keep an eye on it. During all of this, I have went back and forth between: is it mold? is it my thyroid? is it lymphoma? am I just crazy? Let me tell you, most doctors will just let you know that you’re crazy and it’s in your head. It’s not. Not at all. Hashimoto’s After my thyroid scan came back negative, they checked my thyroid antibodies to see if that’s why I was in so much pain and fatigued. My antibodies were through the roof, so they switched me to Armour Thyroid, which was supposed to relieve my fatigue. Next, I developed a large lump under my tongue. It was soft and painless, however, I believe it was what caused my teeth to shift. It made it more difficult to chew and swallow. It was more annoying that anything and definitely not normal. One physician in the ENT practice said the lump was an infected salivary gland and didn’t know what to tell me since I was refusing antibiotics. The other doctor said we all have them, which I, along with several other people beg to differ with his medical expertise. There were one on each side. The one pictured is the largest of the two. So here is the mysterious "lump" or gland: I referred to it as a "lump," which infuriated the doctor for some reason. I also told him that a dentist told me it was a lingual tonsil. He said, “THAT is not a lump and it is not a lingual tonsil. We all have those. You’re just sticking your tongue out to the side, which makes it look like something it's not." I can’t argue with someone who won’t listen to me and especially not someone who is an idiot, so I left. I still don’t know what it is, but I can tell you that it is still there and bleeds from time to time. It doesn’t hurt but something is pressing on one of my left facial nerves, and I look like I have Bell’s Palsy. He also told me that I needed to get my "fear of antibiotics" out of my head. After my ENT doctor told me that there is nothing wrong with me, I gave up. I got super depressed, lost my jobs that I did from home, became a hermit, etc. I was a walking corpse. I lost 15 pounds, had terrible IBS, stomach cramps, bloating, and all of my previous symptoms on top of these. I wasn’t able to even keep track of our bills, which is something I have always taken pride in doing. I paid some bills three times in one month, while forgetting to pay the others. I couldn’t comprehend anything. Then, I found a doctor who treats people suffering from mold toxicity. He did a physical, viewed my pictures of the mold and my mold report, and listened. He suggested that I have a blood test to check for systemic candida, which is a yeast infection (fungus) throughout your entire body. I agreed, even after realizing my insurance wouldn’t cover the $200+ for this test. Our insurance doesn’t even cover my visits to see him, which cost $400 initially. But there was more... Nail Fungus He also noticed an obvious symptom of mold toxicity and candida almost immediately: my nails. I bite my nails but they had become warped. They started warping about 2 years prior to my visit with this doctor and had gotten horrible. He said it could take up to 2 years for them to get rid of the nail fungus. I am extremely embarrassed of my nails in general because I bite them. Although it is considered OCD, I’m still very ashamed and disgusted that I do it. My nails began looking like this slowly. I began growing holes at the tops, where the lunula is (the moon shaped part of your nail). Then, they began growing rigid or bumpy. Eventually, they started peeling and sometimes had tiny white specks under the nail. Prepare to be disgusted: My nutritional doctor was the only doctor who knew what was wrong immediately. Every doctor I had asked before him told me that they had never seen this before but to take a multivitamin. Great advice. Too bad I had an extreme case of mold poisoning. Oddly enough, it wasn’t on my toenails. So, long story short: I had systemic candida. I was given a 30+ day supply of Diflucan, which cleared it up. I was to follow a strict no-sugar diet and instructed to get the mold fixed. Otherwise, it will keep coming back. The doctor was right, it came back. I could tell it came back because my intestines felt like they had something living inside of them. Body Rash I developed ring worm, which is a fungus. It’s not actual worms inside your body. It was under my armpit and itched. The Diflucan cleared that up rather quickly: I also developed bacterial infections on my skin. It started in my scalp and the nutritional doctor confirmed that it was a bacterial infection, most likely caused from the toxic mold. I now have them on below my jaw line, directly on my glands. I have had them for probably over a year now. You can see them in the next picture. Swollen Glands I consistently have had swollen glands for going on 2 years now. They take turns in who wants to swell each week, I swear. Swollen lymph nodes, which feel like little pebbles of fat, also swell up very often. You can see one below, and it is located beneath my ear. (Also noticed the red zit-looking dots. Those are bacterial infections.). They don’t cause any pain but can be very annoying. Neurological/Depression Aside from my left jaw being numb, the left side of my body kept going numb as well. I actually fell down one morning while I was going to get my son out of bed. A picture of the bruise is below. I developed nodules on my temples and my brain felt like it was pounding frequently. I was referred to a neurologist who said I was depressed. I was in shock that he even mentioned that, and I left very unhappy. I’ve struggled with depression my entire life and have been on almost every antidepressant there is. I always stop the medication, usually because of weight gain or some other side effect. This time was different. I didn’t feel depressed. I wasn’t sad. I know what depression is and this was not depression, or so I thought. I was just exhausted, numb, in pain, and had no interest in doing anything other than sleeping. I denied my depression to everyone, including myself. But I gave the medication a try because it is also clinically proven to help with bone pain. Come to find out, he was right. I had clinical depression. I am still taking Cymbalta for the depression and pain. It seems to be working quite well, although I do still have a little back and leg pain off and on. I also still have periodic numbness and tingling, but it’s in both arms and legs. The left side of my face is still numb as well. I have now realized that it is true: I will not get better until I get away from this mold. Mold on Skin Gross, I know. My feet turned black, my fingerprints began turning black, and I had a spot of mold that would not go away in between two of my toes. After the Diflucan, it all cleared up and has not yet returned. But yes, mold can begin to grow on your body and no, it was not dirt. For starters, I live in North Carolina and our dirt is red. This was fungus. I always shower daily and have OCD with having a clean home. I couldn’t wash this stuff off. The only thing I could remove was the mold between my toes by peeling the top layer of skin off. Bloody Noses While I never experienced a bloody nose, my husband did occasionally. He also developed allergies for the first time in his life. He works outdoors as a certified arborist, meaning he works with TREES. He’s used to being outside and exposed to every kind of mold possible. The area we live at in North Carolina has horrific tree pollen during allergy season, and it has never bothered him in his entire life of growing up here. He began getting bloody noses on the weekends, when he was home. He’s your typical man and has refused to see a doctor to get a diagnosis. He also experience red, itchy, watery eyes and coughs quite often. (He’s also a non-smoker.) This is My Theory: We had Stachybotrys spores in our air. We breathed them in, they were on our skin, on our clothes, on everything. It immediately caused typical allergy symptoms and sinus infections that would not go away. After several rounds of antibiotics, I not only killed the good bacteria but I also killed the bad bacteria in my gut. This resulted in the systemic yeast infection. I bite my nails. When I put my fingernails in my mouth, I obtained mold spores directly into my salivary glands and also throughout my entire body. This is also why I ended up having so many bad side effects from the mold. Plus, I have hypothyroidism, which is an autoimmune disorder. People with autoimmune disorders are more prone to illnesses in general. However, I wasn’t diagnosed with hypothyroidism until the mold began. So, can mold cause hypothyroidism? As a result, I ended up looking like a rotting carcass with fungus growing inside and out. It’s another reason that I need to stop biting and picking my nails. It’s going to be impossible to fully recover until this mold is completely out of our home and body systems. Had I not gotten treatment, I could have easily died. So, yes, toxic mold can kill you. As promised, the next page has a quick rundown of my diagnoses and symptoms that I experienced living in a home with toxic black mold. Diagnoses: Hypothyroidism Hashimoto’s Disease Calcified benign thyroid nodule, 3 cm Sinus infections Sialadenitis (bacterial salivary gland infection) Systemic candida Clinical depression Symptoms: (Yes, I experienced ALL of these while living in black mold) Fatigue Memory loss Trouble concentrating Brain fog Weakness of arms and legs Numbness and tingling of arms and legs Anxiety Depression Swollen glands and lymph nodes Jaw clenching at night Shifting of teeth from swollen glands Fungal nail infections Black feet Bacterial skin infections Orthostatic hypotension (low blood pressure on standing) Loss of interest in activities that I used to enjoy (hiking, shopping, couponing, etc.) Dizziness Weight loss Shortness of breath Body aches, muscle joints Felt like my brain was swelling at times Nausea, especially in the middle of the night IBS Bacterial infections (vaginal) Amenorrhea (no periods) Food allergies (developed allergy to pineapple) Cold intolerance Cold sores Watery, itchy, red eyes Runny nose Sinus infections Headaches Chest pains Lung pain, especially in the upper part Rapid heart beat Room spinning (this happened on two separate occasions) Left sided facial numbness My husband experienced: Bloody noses New, onset allergies Body aches Fatigue Nerve pain 10 comments COMMENTS In order to comment on BlogHer.com, you'll need to be logged in.

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Chrome will soon have a Google Now new tab page By Ida Torres - August 19, 2016 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter When Google wants to experiment with things, they have several ways of playing around with it. They can roll out features to selected users or they can just go ahead and release said feature in beta or Dev versions. When it comes to their Chrome browser, they do it in the Chrome Dev version. It looks like they’re playing around now with a new kind of New Tab page and it is powered by Google Now. When you go to the Chrome Dev version and open up a new tab, what you’ll see is your recent bookmarks and if you scroll down a bit or if you don’t have any content from bookmarks, you’ll see suggested news stories similar to what you see in your Google Now page. This means that if you’re searching for the most relevant news to you, based on what you like or are interested in, then all you have to do is open a new tab in Chrome Dev, and hopefully Chrome itself too someday, and you’ll be updated through the Google Now cards. If you tried Chrome Dev and you don’t see this new option, you might have to toggle a flag to see it. It’s the “Show content snippets on the New Tab page” button. There are actually other options, like showing only content on most visited sites or using non-personalized data, which kinda defeats the purpose if you ask us. Since this is still a dev feature, there will probably be a few bugs here and there. To experience this new New Tab in Chrome feature, just go on and use the Chrome Dev version. You can also see it in the Chrome Beta version, but the bookmarks aren’t included and the source of the links aren’t that clear. So might as well use Chrome Dev to see it.

Black and white wallpapers for macOS and iOS   skip to main content skip to main menu     With few weeks until iOS 10’s fall release, iOS 9 adoption hits 87 percent of devices By Christian Zibreg, Aug 18, 2016 Tweet 11 Comments Various editions of iOS 9 are currently installed on 87 percent of iPhone, iPad and iPod touch devices, a one-point gain versus a month ago. During the same period, iOS 8 has dropped from eleven to ten percent of devices, suggesting much of iOS 9’s growth could be owed to upgrades. Earlier editions of iOS continue to comprise about three percent of devices. The stats were derived from Apple’s logs capturing devices that accessed the App Store on August 15, 2016, and are publicized on the App Store dashboard. By comparison, Google’s official stats have Android 6.0 Marshmallow powering 15.2 percent of smartphones and tablets, with the two-year-old Lollipop (5.0-5.1) OS found on more than one-third of Android hardware (35.3 percent). Google’s numbers don’t take into account the following: Devices without Google Play services, like those sold in China Forked Android builds, like Amazon Fire OS Devices running Android versions older than 2.2 Any other devices that did not visit the Play Store during a seven-day period ending on August 1, 2016 Google’s fragmentation problem and slow rollouts of software upgrades by carriers and device vendors should be blamed for the fact that a vast majority of Android device owners run software more than two years old. Of course, Android continues to dominate in terms of worldwide market share. As per Gartner, Android smartphones accounted for 86.2 percent of worldwide sales in the June quarter. During the same period, iOS lost two percentage points, falling from 14.6 percent worldwide in the second quarter of 2015 to 12.9 percent. “In the second quarter of 2016, Samsung had nearly 10 percent more market share than Apple,” said Gartner. “Samsung saw sales of its Galaxy A and Galaxy J series smartphones compete strongly with Chinese manufacturers. Its new smartphone portfolio also helped Samsung win back share it recently lost in emerging markets.” iPhone sales dipped sharply in Greater China and Asia/Pacific and slightly in Apple’s two strongest markets: U.S. and Western Europe. On a more positive note, its sales in Eastern Europe, Eurasia and Sub-Saharan Africa grew 95 percent year over year. All told, the Cupertino firm has had three consecutive quarters of slowing demand as sales declined 7.7 percent. In Apple’s defense, market share doesn’t tell the whole story. For starters, the company does not compete in the mid and low-end of the global smartphone market at all—its most affordable iPhone is the $399 iPhone SE. With strong global sales of sub-$400 devices (most of the handsets sold in India are sub-$100 phones, for example), of course market share numbers are going to be skewed significantly in Android’s favor. Bottom line: Android is the world’s most-used mobile OS, but iOS remains the king of the hill when it comes to device and app profitability and third-party software support.

I wonder if the late rise has anything to do with a recent jailbreak release… Dany Quirion 99% of ios users dont give a crap about jailbreak Scott Curry Nice made up statistic you have there… John Smith It’s not made up. 1 billion iOS devices, probably saying 100 million jailbreak is a huge exaggeration. 99.99% would be more accurate. Scott Curry Not made up? Cool. Show me where you got your information from. Links andor citations? John Smith I know I’m wasting my time because you’re going to continue being a childish prick, but for others who actually will do their research this is what I have. When Apple reached the 500 million mark for iOS devices, roughly 23 million were reported to be jailbroken and active. This was at the time iOS 6 was released I believe, so jailbreaking really was in high demand, as on top of tweaks, full fledged themes could have been made, which since iOS 7 have been limited to simply changing icons. As the theme customization went down, and iOS went more colorful and feature-rich, less and less people felt the need to jailbreak their devices apart from the dedicated fanbase, and piraters (which you probably are as well). And as quality tweaks disappeared, less and less people have been inclined to rejailbreak because their tweak purchases would go to waste an update or two later. By iOS 9, only about 7 million people jailbroke their iOS devices, which really is saying something about the jailbreak scene. Even when you take outdated devices that can no longer be hacked, over half a million devices still support the latest iOS version. By adding numbers, it is still less than 1%. If you’re seriously going to continue saying “where’s your proof”, you can go do the research yourself under “percentage of people jailbreaking iphones”. Tommy correct, shut up the child 😀 Scott Curry I did 🙂 Scott Curry It’s not on me to do any research as I’m not providing any statistics. I didn’t know asking for validation of stats was childish. I thought it’s childish to spout stats with nothing to back it up. Dig on this: 83.6% of reported statistics are made up on the spot. 😉 John Smith You do realize if I post a link Disqus will “queue” my comment to be approved by iDB right? Sometimes it takes them a few days to approve it. Stop dragging this further than it needs to go and look it up. Or continue being obnoxious, whichever seems easier for you. I got Stranger Things to catch up to. Scott Curry I stated a possible correlation, nothing more. You want to try to be a ‘childish prick’ and throw out justification of stats just trying to continue an argument that you didn’t even start in the first place. No one was even talking to you until you felt the need to step in with your anonymous login. So…John Smith (lol)….go watch your Netflix and just chillllllllllll. I’m done with you.

Home Church & Ministries U.S. World Politics Entertainment living Opinion Microsoft Classroom vs Google Classroom: Tech Companies Dish Out Virtual Learning Platforms; Race is on for Supremacy By CP Contributor Aug 19, 2016 | 3:08 AM As methods of education continue to evolve through time, tech companies such as Microsoft and Google offer their own Classroom services to cater to the growing needs of students and educators. Microsoft Classroom Microsoft launched the Classroom platform last 2015, as part of the Office 365 Education package. This plan includes the essential Office programs and applications such as Microsoft Word (word-processing), Excel (spreadsheet), PowerPoint (slideshow presentations), and OneNote (note-taking), among others. Teachers can fully take advantage of the Microsoft Classroom features, which includes managing all classes and organizing multiple class sections. They can also interact with their students, as well as give assignments through the built-in program integration with OneNote. Yes, I want Breaking Christian News Submit One of the most interesting features of Microsoft Classroom is the Professional Learning Center (PLC)—where teachers can interact with other professionals to help centralize resources and pool their lessons. Students can also utilize the Sway service which encourages students to create notes with visually enticing layout, to further simplify their learning. Google Classroom Meanwhile, Google introduced its Classroom service earlier at 2014. Google Classroom is a web-based platform that is part of Google's ever-growing array of productivity apps aimed to help everyone access basic software services for a lower (or even zero) cost. Similar to Microsoft's program, Google Classroom integrates to Google's basic applications—Docs, Sheets, Slides, Gmail, and Calendar. Teachers may also create classes and add sections. They can also easily enroll students from their contact list through emails, or the students may enroll themselves to the class group directly. Similarly, educators may hand out homeworks and quizzes to be answered by students. Teachers may also instantaneously grade the requirements and upload their feedback. With Google Classroom, however, teachers can utilize Google services such as Drive, YouTube, and other webpages in creating their notes. Which is better? Both of these programs offer services that aid students and teachers with their education system. Microsoft Classroom is free for students and teachers availing the corresponding Office package. Google Classroom is likewise free for pretty much everyone who has a Google account. They both have mobile applications for Android and iOS devices. However, Microsoft Classroom offers a more feature-packed experience, with PLC for teachers and Sway for students. On the other hand, Google Classroom offers a more streamlined and direct approach, with better interface to navigate. It also offers an option for parents to monitor their child's performance. Final thoughts One could never go wrong in choosing either one of these platforms. With education being at the forefront of development, technology helps teachers and students alike to adapt, make use of the virtual learning as well as enhancing education by making it more interactive and efficient.

According to report, Google could release Android 7.0 Nougat update for existing Nexus range on August 22. The date leak comes via Canadian telecom operator Telus in its latest software update schedule. According to Android Central, Telus was accurate with its launch date for Marshmallow update on Nexus devices last year. If Google debuts Android 7.0 Nougat this month, it would be a paradigm shift in the way Android updates have been delivered so far. For now, Google has been launching new versions of Android with release of new Nexus devices and it might change this time around. Earlier this year, Google released Android N Developer Preview, which offered early access to Android N on Nexus devices, Google Pixel C and Sony Xperia Z3. Further adding substance to this announcement from Telus, LG has announced an Android Nougat limited preview program for Korean G5s, which apparently debuts on August 22. Google shares the final code of its mobile OS with all major phone manufacturers in advance. This allows them to add their own custom skin on top before pushing the update to their devices.

Google Duo Becomes the Most Popular Free App in the Play Store The application was released just days ago Aug 19, 2016 12:03 GMT  ·  By Alexandra Vaidos  ·  Share:  Google first announced Duo during Google I/O, together with Allo, a new messaging app that comes with AI features. Even though the highly anticipated video calling app Duo was released just a few days ago, it seems that it has started to gain popularity really fast among users of Android smartphones. Google’s Duo has become the number 1 free app in Google Play Store, surpassing other popular applications at the moment, including Messenger and Facebook, according to a Twitter post by Justin Uberti, who part of the Duo team at Google. Considering the craze around Pokemon Go lately, one would think that it is the ruler of all apps in the Play Store, but surprisingly, it ranks only third among all applications in the Play Store in the USA, surpassed by Google Duo and Facebook’s Messenger. Google’s Duo has also gained a high rating on the Play Store, 4.5 stars higher than all top 5 free apps. Snapchat occupies the fifth position in the index, followed by YouTube Music. Google’s Duo is already available worldwide, and the application can be used by any Android smartphone owner, as long as they run Android 4.1 or later. In case you didn't know, Duo is a simple app for placing video calls and comes with a neat feature that allows users to see a video of the caller before they pick up the call. This way, they won’t miss any important details and will see who’s calling. In addition, Google intends to add audio calling to Duo as well. Google’s Duo is known to provide strong video calls and allow switching between mobile data and WiFi instantaneously, without dropping the call. Google Duo now launched in all countries. #1 app in the Play Store, 4.5 star rating! 🎦📈🙌 pic.twitter.com/hbN09ku20k — Justin Uberti (@juberti) August 18, 2016 #Google#Duo#Allo#Google Play Store#Android reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Google to Add Audio Calls Support in Duo Google Begins Rollout of Video Calling App Duo on Android and iOS Home Button in Nougat 7.0 Shown in Animation, Could Be Tied to Google Assistant Google’s Allo and Duo Apps Get New Icons in the Play Store iPhone 8 to Feature Traditional Wireless Charging like the Samsung Galaxy S7 Lenovo Builds a New Microsoft Surface Clone and It Looks Fabulous Anonymous Hackers Want McAfee to Be Trump’s Security Adviser, Call for March Hackers Could Infect Headphones to Spy on You The LG V20 Has Been Successfully Rooted Galaxy S6 and S7 Owners Complain About Samsung’s Stock Email App Facebook Is Testing a New Snapchat-like Camera Feature Google Adds Stranger Things Stickers to Allo, New Themes to Arrive Soon    Google Duo is top free app in Play Store New Android APKs VivaVideo APK: Updated November 23rd, 14:19 GMT PowerDirector APK: Updated November 23rd, 14:08 GMT WeVideo APK: Updated November 23rd, 14:04 GMT Amazon Rapids APK: Updated November 23rd, 14:02 GMT ActionDirector APK: Updated November 23rd, 13:58 GMT DataEye APK: Updated November 23rd, 13:46 GMT JOOX APK: Updated November 23rd, 13:46 GMT Reader comments Load old comments   Don't Install Note 7 ROMs on Previous Models, Samsung Could Limit Battery Charge more on: Galaxy Note 7 i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2016 Softpedia.

Getty Images Facial recognition makes sense as a method for your computer to recognize you. After all, humans already use a powerful version of it to tell each other apart. But people can be fooled (disguises! twins!), so it’s no surprise that even as computer vision evolves, new attacks will trick facial recognition systems, too. Now researchers have demonstrated a particularly disturbing new method of stealing a face: one that’s based on 3-D rendering and some light Internet stalking. Earlier this month at the Usenix security conference, security and computer vision specialists from the University of North Carolina presented a system that uses digital 3-D facial models based on publicly available photos and displayed with mobile virtual reality technology to defeat facial recognition systems. A VR-style face, rendered in three dimensions, gives the motion and depth cues that a security system is generally checking for. The researchers used a VR system shown on a smartphone’s screen for its accessibility and portability. Their attack, which successfully spoofed four of the five systems they tried, is a reminder of the downside to authenticating your identity with biometrics. By and large your bodily features remain constant, so if your biometric data is compromised or publicly available, it’s at risk of being recorded and exploited. Faces plastered across the web on social media are especially vulnerable—look no further than the wealth of facial biometric data literally called Facebook. Spotting poor, mediocre, and high-quality images of one study participant’s face using publicly available Facebook photos. Department of Computer Science/UNC Chapel Hill Other groups have done similar research into defeating facial recognition systems, but unlike in previous studies, the UNC test models weren’t developed from photos the researchers took or ones that the study participants provided. The researchers instead went about collecting images of the 20 volunteers the way any Google stalker might—through image search engines, professional photos, and publicly available assets on social networks like Facebook, LinkedIn, and Google+. They found anywhere from three to 27 photos of each volunteer. “We could leverage online pictures of the [participants], which I think is kind of terrifying,” says True Price, a study author who works on computer vision at UNC. “You can’t always control your online presence or your online image.” Price points out that many of the study participants are computer science researchers themselves, and some make an active effort to protect their privacy online. Still, the group was able to find at least three photos of each of them. The researchers tested their virtual reality face renders on five authentication systems—KeyLemon, Mobius, TrueKey, BioID, and 1D. All are available from consumer software vendors like the Google Play Store and the iTunes Store and can be used for things like protecting data and locking smartphones. To test the security systems, the researchers had the subjects program each one to detect their real faces. Then they showed 3-D renders of each subject to the systems to see if they would accept them. In addition to making face models from online photos, the researchers also took indoor head shots of each participant, rendered them for virtual reality, and tested these against the five systems. Using the control photos, the researchers were able to trick all five systems in every case they tested. Using the public web photos, the researchers were able to trick four of the systems with success rates from 55 percent up to 85 percent. The process of preparing facial models for the attack. Department of Computer Science/UNC Chapel Hill Face authentication systems have been proliferating in consumer products like laptops and smartphones—Google even announced this year that it’s planning to put a dedicated image processing chip into its smartphones to do image recognition. This could help improve Android’s facial authentication, which was easily spoofed when it launched in 2011 under the name “Face Unlock” and was later improved and renamed “Trusted Face.” Nonetheless, Google warns, “This is less secure than a PIN, pattern, or password. Someone who looks similar to you could unlock your phone.” Facial authentication spoofing attacks can use 2-D photos, videos, or in this case, 3-D face replicas (virtual reality renders, 3-D printed masks) to trick a system. For the UNC researchers, the most challenging part of executing their 3-D replica attack was working with the limited image resources they could find for each person online. Available photos were often low resolution and didn’t always depict people’s full faces. To create digital replicas, the group used the photos to identify “landmarks” of each person’s face, fit these to a 3-D render, and then used the best quality photo (factoring in things like resolution, lighting, and pose) to combine data about the texture of the face with the 3-D shape. The system also needed to extrapolate realistic texture for parts of the face that weren’t visible in the original photo. “Obtaining an accurately shaped face we found was not terribly difficult, but then retexturing the faces to look like the victims’ was a little trickier and we were trying solve problems with different illuminations,” Price says. If a face model didn’t succeed at fooling a system, the researchers would try using texture data from a different photo. The last step for each face render was correcting the eyes so they appeared to look directly into the camera for authentication. At this point, the faces were ready to be animated as needed for “liveness clues” like blinking, smiling, and raising eyebrows—basically authentication system checks intended to confirm that a face is alive. Working on facial rendering to produce realistic texture. Department of Computer Science/UNC Chapel Hill In the “cat-and-mouse game” of face authenticators and attacks against them, there are definitely ways systems can improve to defend against these attacks. One example is scanning faces for human infrared signals, which wouldn’t be reproduced in a VR system. “It is now well known that face biometrics are easy to spoof compared to other major biometric modalities, namely fingerprints and irises,” says Anil Jain, a biometrics researcher at Michigan State University. He adds, though, that, “While 3-D face models may visually look similar to the person’s face that is being spoofed, they may not be of sufficiently high quality to get authenticated by a state of the art face matcher.” The UNC researchers agree that it would be possible to defend against their attack. The question is how quickly consumer face authentication systems will evolve to keep up with new methods of spoofing. Ultimately, these systems will probably need to incorporate hardware and sensors beyond just mobile cameras or web cams, and that might be challenging to implement on mobile devices where hardware space is very limited. “Some vendors—most notably Microsoft with its Windows Hello software—already have commercial solutions that leverage alternative hardware,” UNC’s Price says. “However, there is always a cost-benefit to adding hardware, and hardware vendors will need to decide whether there is enough demand from and benefit for consumers to add specialized components like IR cameras or structured light projectors.” Biometric authenticators have the potential to be extremely powerful security mechanisms, but they’re threatened when would-be attackers gain easy access to personal data. In the Office of Personnel Management breach last year, for instance, hackers stole data for 5.6 million people’s fingerprints. Those markers will be in the wild for the rest of the victims’ lives. That data breach debacle, and the UNC researchers’ study, captures the troubling nature of biometric authentication: When your fingerprint–or faceprint–leaks into the ether, there’s no password reset button that can change it.

CONTENT Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide POPULAR TOPICS Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Popular Topics  Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Twitter Google+ Facebook Youtube RSS Search SlashGear Search Android tablets endangered: searching for a new purpose JC Torres - Aug 19, 2016 11 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit A few years back, analysts and market watchers loved picking on the PCs, by which they traditional meant desktops and laptops, as the underdogs of the consumer tech industry. These days, however, that status has befallen the tablet, whose sales have seen continuously plummeting numbers. But with the iPad Pro and the proliferation of Windows 2-in-1 hybrids, that is even more so the case with Android tablets, despite the strength of their numbers. Why has this once popular device class become so laid low? Is there a way to save them, or should we even bother trying? I’d say yes, but it’s going to take some guts, which OEMs have unfortunately lost in the past years. A kingdom under siege on all sides Android tablets were a phenomenon. Although it took a while before it caught traction, partly due to Google’s slow adoption of the form factor for Android, the variety and number of options, especially when it comes to prices, sang to consumer’s hearts. They didn’t have to shell out hundreds and hundreds of dollars for a shiny iPad. They could, in a way, dictate their own terms, matching features for price or vice versa. Tablets also filled in a very real need. Users needed a mobile device that allowed them to more comfortably browse the Web, watch videos, send emails, flaunt photos, and maybe even, though very painfully, type out a document. Things that a laptop could do but more portable and more affordable. These gave rise to tablets of all sizes and prices, with some, like the Samsung Galaxy Note and the ASUS Transformer Pad, addressing niche markets with a focus on productivity or creativity. But this was during a time when phablets were considered ridiculous and smartphones didn’t go beyond 5 inches without looking obscene. These days, however, smartphones like the iPhone SE are the exception rather than the norm. In short, they have cannibalized the tablet market from the bottom. Why would you want to get a tablet, especially a 7 or 8 inch one when a 5.5-inch smartphone can do all of the above and more? Some even have fallen in love to extremely large phablets, 6 inches or higher, precisely because they function as both gigantic smartphone and mini tablet. On the other end of the spectrum, higher end and larger tablets were being threatened by the Windows uprising. Off to a terrible start with Windows 8, Microsoft’s finger-friendly OS has finally caught up in Windows 10, and OEMs have taken notice. There are a lot more 2-in-1 hybrids, convertible laptops than ever before, and, in exchange for some heft, they offer more functionality and flexibility than tablets, especially the bigger and more expensive ones. For a time, almost all tablets were feeling the heat. But Apple managed to keep the wolf away when it unveiled the iPad Pro. At least for now. Android tablets, on the other hand, were seemingly stuck in a hopeless situation, and manufacturers have responded as expected, by pulling out. Catch-22 Dell’s recent mini-announcement that it was ceasing development of Android tablets in favor of Windows is perhaps the best example of this almost self-fulfilling prophecy that manufacturers have found themselves in. And although you can’t blame them for just simply trying to follow the sway of the market, you can definitely chide them for helping create this situation in the first place. In the earlier days of the tablet fever, Android tablet makers rushed to innovate and be “first” in the market. You had tablets with styluses, tablets that transformed into laptops, or phones that transformed into tablets. Some of these ideas eventually found their way into Windows tablets and iPads. Ironically, Android tablet makers have stopped there. Perhaps they saw the decreasing ROI and decided that the costs of R&D and manufacturing were just too much to bear. So instead they cast their gazes low and sought to cater to the lower end. That has always been the case for many less known models, but soon even big brands like Samsung and LG would produce more low to mid range tablets and very little innovation on the higher end. For a very short while, that may have worked. But then smartphones got started becoming bigger and more powerful. A very large mid-range smartphone these days could run circles around most tablets except in battery life. And those allowed you to make phone calls and take it with you everywhere. And just like how feature phones and low end smartphones, despite their high sales numbers, are only a small dot in financial reports, so to are cheap, low end tablets. OEMs have created a tablet market that increasingly catered to the low end, and now that end is being devoured by smartphones. New Direction Tablets are transforming, and admittedly, what worked before isn’t going to work anymore, as the market numbers so painfully show. If tablets, especially Android ones, are to survive, they need to find a new reason to exist, a new place in the personal computing spectrum. While it would seem that smartphones have indeed almost made tablets redundant, tablets still have venues to grow and go, especially along the paths shown by devices like the Microsoft Surface and the iPad Pro. Majority of the Android tablets for the past 2 years or so have mostly been consumption devices. Any content creation capabilities were mostly a by-product of the devices’ processing power and size, not an advertised feature. In contrast, the Surface and the iPad Pro have endeared themselves to creators, whether they be document writers, artists, or multimedia workers. Not only do they have the power, they also have an ecosystem of features and accessories that help make it happen. While that does dangerously venture into laptop territory, tablets will, at least for the forseeable future, offer some things that tablets will not be able to, like portability, flexibility, and battery life, among other things. With some compromises and changes in workflow, even tablets like the iPad Pro can become useful as every drivers for work. Android tablets are, of course, just as capable. If only Android itself actually helped. Android Nougat: a start, not a panacea It is almost ironic that Android, a more open mobile platform, seems to lag behind in this regard. In truth, the OS has already been capable of a lot of the things that iOS 9 has been boasting about, especially on the iPad Pro. The features are there and the hooks for developers have always been there. And, as Samsung itself has demonstrated, there are ways to go around the limitations if necessary. But while that is true under the hood, Android in general hasn’t made that widely and easily available to all developers, no matter the brand of tablet. The favorite example of this is split screen and multi-window capabilities. That has always been technically possible but it will only be in Android 7.0 Nougat, due this fall, that it will become more widely accessible. And even then, do expect some growing pains. But that’s not the only area where Android needs work to become a more productive, multi-form platform. The OS has built-in in support for input devices, especially mice, but the platform and apps don’t fully adjust to that, sometimes still requiring a “click and hold” gesture that is alien to mouse users. In a nutshell, Android, as a platform, is technically capable of becoming more than what it is today, but the devil is always in the details. Android Nougat strives to address some of those, but it’s really just the beginning. And neither is it the only thing that needs fixing. Android needs a tablet hero While that is all and well on the software side, that will all be moot if there is no device to show it off. The precarious situation Android tablets are in right now wasn’t exactly caused by deficiencies in the software, though that definitely played a part. It was primarily because of increasingly lackluster hardware. Android tablets have started to look so similar, at least on the inside, that choosing one has become mostly a matter of aesthetic taste or brand loyalty than on actual competitive features. Contrast that to smartphones, which, though starting to look similar as well, are still racing towards innovation, be it for screens, fast charging, biometrics, or whatnot. What the Android tablet market needs, then, is a device that screams “this is what an Android Tablet should be!” That has traditionally been the role of Google’s Nexus devices, showcasing the best of the best Android hardware. But if the Nexus is the representation of Google’s vision for Android, then, sad to say, we might not really be able to pin our hopes on it. Compared to Nexus smartphones, Nexus tablets are just as plain as the myriad of Android tablets in the market, differentiated only by its higher end specs. Google has not exactly been enthusiastic about tablets, seen to have dragged its feet at first in making Android compatible with larger screens. There are new Nexus smartphones in the cards, but no new Nexus tablet, which is perhaps indicative of that continuing attitude. The exception to this is, of course, the Google Pixel C, and admittedly admirable piece of tablet hardware. But the Pixel C also demonstrated how hardware and software must be in sync. The tablet was perhaps put out too early, in Google’s rush to say “I have a 2-in-1 tablet too!” And that has damaged the tablet’s credibility. Nougat will, of course, address some of those points, but, again, it’s not going to be a magic wand either. Final Thoughts But do we even need Android tablets at this point? That’s a resounding yes, both from a marketing perspective and a growth consideration. Both Microsoft and Apple are already singing about how they have tablets that are also PCs, but, with a few exceptions like the Jide Remix Ultratablet or Samsung’s now defunct Galaxy Note Pro, Google’s camp has largely been quiet. It sends the wrong message that Android isn’t fit for that market, when, in theory and technically, it should have been there first. And tablets aren’t really going away, despite the slumping numbers. They are transforming, much of them becoming 2-in-1 hybrids that are, themselves, becoming distinct from conventional laptops, which, in turn, are also becoming even beefier workhorses fit for hardcore gaming in lighter forms. Android needs to corner this market if it is truly to be a platform for almost every device. Android needs more places to grow. Android Wear is somewhat stagnating. Android Auto is still rolling out. And Android TV almost feels dead on arrival. Ironically, one of the newest growth opportunities for Android might be one of its oldest as well: tablets.

Follow TechnoBuffalo Google has announced plans to open a physical YouTube store in London. Named the “Creator Store,” it will be situated on the ground floor of Google’s office in King’s Cross, and it will sell things like books, mugs, clothes, photo frames, and more. Much of the merchandise sold in the Creator Store, which will become part of the new YouTube Space that launched this week, according to Business Insider, will have been created by designers working with some of the most popular YouTube stars. The store will also be used for book signings and product releases, and will contain three studios with professional equipment that popular YouTubers can take advantage of. Google hopes this can help creators improve the quality of their videos. The store will also house a barista bar and community area that can be used by the public, and all profits made will be passed onto merchandise creators, according to Darlington Howard, a YouTube senior program strategist at Google. It’s not yet clear which YouTubers will be selling their merchandise, or exactly when the Creator Store will open its doors. However, Google has confirmed it will be ready for the public within the next four weeks.

Otto, a 90-person start-up includes former Google and Carnegie Mellon engineers, The New York Times reported. According to Uber chief executive officer and co-founder Travis Kalanick, Otto was co-founded earlier this year by Anthony Levandowski, an engineer who once worked at Google on self-driving technology and two other former colleagues to equip trucks with software, sensors, lasers and cameras so they will be able to navigate the highway on their own, EFE news reported. Levandowski will lead “combined self-driving efforts reporting directly to me — across personal transportation, delivery and trucking,” Kalanick said, noting that “when it comes to this advanced technology stack, Otto plus Uber is a dream team” and that “we now have one of the strongest autonomous engineering groups in the world.” The acquisition of Otto follows Uber’s recent opening of an advanced technology centre in Pittsburgh, in conjunction with Carnegie Mellon University, The New York Times reported. Uber plans to open a 180,000-sq.ft facility in Palo Alto, California, to house Otto, which will operate as a stand-alone company focused specifically on upending the long-distance trucking industry. Otto engineers will also work out of offices in San Francisco and Pittsburgh. Uber will also be able to use Otto’s huge user base to tap into ride data and improve its mapping solution. On Thursday, Uber also announced that it would begin testing self-driving cars in Pittsburgh in few weeks, allowing people in the city to hail modified versions of Volvo sport utility vehicles (SUV) to get around the city. However, the self-driving revolution has already hit a few speed bumps. The electric-car maker Tesla is under investigation by federal regulators looking into a fatal crash in May of a Tesla Model S sedan whose driver had the vehicle’s Autopilot assisted-driving system engaged.

Lifestyle Tech News iPhone 7: Everything we think we know so far about Apple's latest handset All the leaks and rumours, including price, release date, spec – and the missing headphone jack Andrew Griffin @_andrew_griffin Monday 22 August 2016 09:47 BST Click to follow The Independent Tech 5 features to expect from the new iPhone Popular videos Far-right mob attacks refugee camp on Greek island Trump 'was worried over ex-wife's rape accusation' before debate Alzheimer's Research imagines Christmas without Santa in powerful ad Donald Trump doesn't understand what Citizen Kane is about The new Apple phone is on the way. And, as ever, so are the rumours. The iPhone 7 will be an important release for Apple: it’s the first phone it has launched since sales of the handsets stopped growing. The company has promised to keep innovating to ensure that those sales stay up and people stay interested – so it will be interesting to see how Apple actually manages to do that. Here’s our comprehensive and up-to-date list of everything that’s expected for the new phone. It’ll be continually updated as the launch date approaches. Follow our latest iPhone 7 coverage here Release date This is perhaps the easiest of the secrets to predict: Apple tends to launch the phone at some point the same few days each year, and the release date is as predictable too. This year, the phone had been expected on 7 September – a Wednesday, after the Labor Day long weekend in the US. It’s almost certain that it will fall within this week, although Apple might shift the exact date around slightly. The release itself is expected to come on 16 September, though it might fall a week after. Apple will announce the release date at its launch event. Apple usually starts selling the phone in a limited range of countries first, including the US, UK and some of Europe. It’ll then roll out elsewhere in the following months. All will become clear when Apple sends out its invites to the press, which usually happens towards the end of August. The name The new handset is likely to be called the iPhone 7 after all. That might not seem so surprising, but it is – the phone is expected to be more like another “s” year than a whole new phone, and Apple was thought to be perhaps moving away from its traditional naming system. This year, at least, it’s strongly rumoured that it won’t. The new phone will be the 7 after all.

GAME Digital 38/38 PlayStation VR Customers wait in line to buy the Sony PlayStation virtual reality (PSVR) headset at the entrance of an electronics retail shop before its opening hours in Tokyo Getty No headphone jack Perhaps the biggest rumour about the new phone is what’s not going to be there, rather than what is. There’ll be no traditional headphone jack on the bottom of the next phone, according to a huge number of reports. Instead, people will be encouraged to use either wireless headphones over Bluetooth, or to plug them in to the Lightning charging port on the bottom of the phone. By now, it’s almost certain this is going to happen. But what remains entirely unknown is how Apple will spin it, what headphones they’ll offer in the box and exactly how mad everyone will be. Actually, that last one probably is known. People will be very mad, and then they’ll forget about it. No antenna lines Perhaps the only obvious difference from the iPhone 6 and 6s will be on the back, where there’ll be none of the light, plastic antenna lines that grace the back of those phones. Until now, they’d been presumed to be necessary to allow the phone’s data connection to escape out of the handset – but it seems that Apple might have fixed that. That will mean that the whole back will be the same colour. Colour And that colour might be new. There’s been some suggestion that Apple is working on ether bringing back truly black phones – the 6 and 6s have only come in Space Grey, which is a kind of dark silver – or that it is working on a colour that’s more like a deep blue. A mock-up of the blue iPhone, next to a real space grey one, made by designer Martin Hajek (Martin Hajek) This would make sense, since Apple has been keen on rolling out new colours to its phones, bringing gold to the iPhone 6 and then rose gold to the iPhone  6s. Those colours have been gradually making their way across the rest of the line, too. Waterproofing The phone might be able to go underwater, like some of its competitors - but Apple might not say so. Recent rumours have suggested that Apple is making the new iPhone more hardy, and that alongside a less crackable screen and stronger materials the phone will also be able to go for a swim. Some of the other changes rumoured for the phone appear to back this up. The removal of both the physical home button and the headphone jack might help Apple seal up parts of the phone where water would usually get in, for instance. If this does happen, Apple might choose not to mention it. The company has been gradually making its devices more water resistant – both the Apple Watch and the iPhone have been found to stand more water than advertised - but it appears that Apple is happy allowing that just to ensure that the phones don’t get broken rather than using it as an advertised features. Dual-lens camera Perhaps the biggest improvements this year, if reports are to be believed, will be to the camera. At least some of the versions of the phone are expected to feature a dual-lens camera, which will allow the handset to take far better pictures – images that might rival SLRs in their depth and low light performance. A supposedly leaked picture of how the dual-lens camera might look It isn’t clear yet whether this will only come to the Plus-sized models of the phone – which have in the past received better upgrades to their camera, because there’s more space to put them in – or will come to them all. No actual home button There’ve long been rumours that Apple would drop the home button entirely, so that the whole front of the phone could be a screen. We’re not there yet – but we’re on our way. This year’s phone will include a flush, unpressable home button that will sit in the normal place, according to rumours. It’ll feel like a real button – using the same haptic feedback that lets the actually flat trackpad on the new laptops feel like there’s a button – but you won’t actually press it. iOS 10 What we do know about the new phone is that it’ll run iOS 10. There seem to have been some changes in the new operating system that are built for a new phone – but very little has been given away, despite Apple making the software available for everyone. It does make it possible to open up the phone without ever pressing the Home button, however. And it gives the handset a full spruce-up ready for its new look. Price iPhones usually stay roughly the same price year-on-year, with the new phones moving into the slot inhabited by their predecessor and all the others falling into the different price points accordingly. That will mean that the phone will be priced from about £539 or $649 at the bottom of the range, for the smallest storage and the smaller handset. Prices will then go all the way up to £789 or $849 for the Plus-sized phone at the top storage level. Storage But at least this year you might be getting more space for your cash – Apple is upping the storage at the bottom of its phone line-up, and probably doing the same at the top. That will mean that the likely line-up will go: 32GB, 64GB (or 128GB) or 128GB.

This was what the Nexus range was all about. But this lead to at least a few compromises.  With the arrival of Daydream VR, and with so many hardware makers falling on financial hard times, Google couldn't afford any compromises. The Pixel is the company's first home-made smartphone. It offers the latest version of Android, with a few Pixel-specific features, and support for the as-yet-unreleased VR system. Google Pixel Review: Design The Pixel may not have been technically built by Google, but neither is the iPhone technically built by Apple. It's commonplace to have another company building the actual hardware. For the Pixel, Google chose HTC, a company which has seen its own-brand devices slump in popularity over recent years. But here's the good part: HTC knows how to build really good phones. Google Pixel and Pixel XL: When and where can I get them? Think back to the Nexus One, undoubtedly one of the best-made Nexus phones released. It was built by HTC. More recently, the HTC One Series, ranging from the M7 to M9, all drew plaudits for their industrial design. In short: Google couldn't have picked a better hardware manufacturer. And it shows in the device. Everything about the exterior design and manufacturing feels deliberate, purposeful and precise. Whether you're looking at the textured power button, the Type-C port and flanking cutouts for the mic and speaker, the 3.5mm jack or the weird glass panel on the back, it's all exact. Pocket-lint Then there's the soft bead-blasted metal finish on the back which rounds really nicely towards the perfectly flat edges and the large angle chamfers. All of it is so well finished and designed, it's impossible to ignore. We're not particularly fond of the unusual-looking glass panel on the back, which hosts the camera, sensors, dual-tone LED flash and circular fingerprint sensor. But we get it. In an era where so many smartphones look the same, it's nice to have something different, something that says "this is the Pixel phone". With that, and the single "G" stamped on the back, it's recognisable as a device all of its own. Google Pixel tips: First things to do with your new Google superphone One element that's difficult to get used to is the position of the volume and power buttons. Most phones tend to have the power button lowest, whereas Google opted to put the power button above the volume switch. That means it's easy to accidentally turn volume down, rather than send the phone to sleep. Pocket-lint All these perks and quirks are packed in to a phone which fits really nicely in the hand, feels durable, and has a heft of class without being too heavy. Google Pixel Review: Display With the Pixel being the smaller of the two new Google phones, the 5-inch screen features fewer pixels than its big brother, the Pixel XL. While the larger model has a Quad HD screen, the Pixel has a Full HD panel. Still, 1080 x 1920 pixels shoved into a display that's only 5-inches diagonally makes for a very sharp screen. At 441 pixels per inch, everything is crisp. It is AMOLED too, and comes with all the benefits and drawbacks of choosing that over LCD. Specifically, colours are vibrant, contrast is high and blacks are deep. That means it's fantastic for watching movies, gaming, or viewing anything with lots of colour. Pocket-lint It does mean that whites aren't quite as pure as they would be on a good LCD panel - they come across as ever so slightly warm, but you're unlikely to notice unless you have it side-by-side with an iPhone or other device. On the whole, the Pixel's display is one of the nicest we've seen on a phone at this scale. The panel itself is so close to the glass surface that viewing angles are superb, and content almost appears as if it's on the surface. Google Pixel Review: Software The Google Pixel comes with the brand new version of Android Nougat. But you can take what you know about 7.0 Nougat and throw it away, because the Pixel Launcher and software are considerably different to the software we've been using since the first Nexus developer preview went live a few months ago. Pocket-lint First up is Google Assistant, the voice controlled assistant. It is, essentially, Google Now packaged in to a more human, chat-like user interface. It has many of the same functions you're used to - like telling you the weather, knowing your calendar events, setting reminders, sports scores and much more - but packaged in to an interface that's more intuitive. Part of the setup process - when first powering up the phone - is training it to recognise your voice, the same way Google Now does when you want the "Ok Google" command to wake it up when it's dormant. You can also launch it by tapping and holding the virtual home button. Now, instead of launching a Google Search interface, the command launches a chat thread, similar to Google Allo, the company's messaging app, in the bottom half of the screen which then expands once a question has been posed.  Pocket-lint The beauty of Google Assistant is that it keeps learning. As time goes by, and you use it more, its predictive reply suggestions are more tailored to the kinds of things you would ask or say. Like Google Allo, these appear as individual bubbles underneath the most recent response from Google.  Unlike every version of Android so far, there's no app drawer button. The familiar dotted circle icon has been replaced by an app drawer that simply drags up from the bottom of the home screen. While the gesture feels more intuitive, the biggest benefit of this is that it allows you to have a fifth app icon pinned to the dock. Google Pixel tips and tricks: Getting to grips with Google's phone The app icons themselves have been given a new feature too. Similar to the iPhone, you can bring up app shortcuts for some of the default Android apps like Messenger, Calendar, Camera and Dialler. Because there's no pressure sensitive screen, you bring these up by long-pressing the app.  Another new addition in the Pixel launcher is the wallpaper picker, which now has a vast collection of default wallpapers, including some breathtaking landscapes and cityscapes from professional photographers, as well as Google's own live wallpapers. Some of these react and change colour to match the time and the weather, others are just Google Earth images that move slowly and react as you swipe through home screen spaces.  Pocket-lint All the default app icons are now round, as are the folder windows, and you can quick-reply to notifications without leaving the app you're in, or from the lock screen. But, apart from those design changes and features, there are some real benefits to having a Pixel phone over another Android smartphone.  Firstly, the Google Photos app allows you backup all of your photos in full size, original resolution, for free. Normally, on other Android phones or iPhone, you only get free unlimited backup space if you choose to reduce the quality. What's more, there's no time limit on the offer. As long as you have the Pixel phone, you get full resolution backups.  Secondly, the Settings app has a second tab giving you quick, easy access to a support team. You can call them or start a text-based chat with them as they help you through any issues you're having.  Pocket-lint Apart from those features, the software is otherwise Android 7.1 Nougat as we know it. That includes the split-screen multitasking mode, which seems a little wasted on a 5-inch screen. Although it is still useful for those odd moments when you need to reference a video, map position, or quote while typing an email or message.  Easy access to your battery performance from the drop-down menu - which, by the way, you can access now by swiping down on the Pixel Imprint sensor on the back - is a much welcome addition, as is the ability to add, remove and rearrange quick settings tiles.  Google Pixel Review: Performance One of the benefits of creating its own phone, is that the Google software can be fine-tuned to run like a charm on the hardware. With its clean, stock Android experience, there's no bloat or additional software to get in the way. That means everything is very snappy and smooth in operation. In fact, we'd go as far as saying it's the most responsive Android phone we've ever used. Pocket-lint While a big part of that is the new lightweight software experience, it's also down to the efficient and powerful Snapdragon 821 quad-core processor and 4GB RAM that's on board. Game animations are stutter-free and smooth, while load times are as quick as you'd hope for from a flagship phone. It may not get the highest benchmark scores we've seen during tests, but it still runs like a dream - and that, ultimately, is what matters most. There's the option for 32 or 128GB of storage and as anyone who owned a Nexus will tell you, there's no provision for microSD card expansion here. That's a downside compared to many flagship Android phones. Sure, Apple has never offered expandable storage and that works for iPhone; Android does and in this new competitive "phone by Google" world, customers will expect such features. Google Pixel Review: Battery Life On paper, the 2,770mAh battery may not seem like it would be capacious enough to offer great battery life, but that's where numbers on paper can deceive. There are a couple of things worth taking in to consideration that ensure the Pixel's battery lasts well beyond a full day of regular use. First is thanks again to that software. Like Android Marshmallow before it, Android 7 Nougat has Google Doze. This essentially means that when the phone is put down on a surface and in standby, any excessive background processes are killed. This ensures there's little battery usage when the phone isn't in use, like when you're asleep. Unlike Marshmallow, Nougat's Doze mode is also active when the phone is in your pocket, or in your hand. It doesn't have to be lying still on a flat surface. In short: if your phone isn't being used, your battery isn't either. Pocket-lint With light use, our Pixel got from 07:30 to 18:00 with 60 per cent of its capacity left. For light users, this Pixel phone could even be a two day phone. Most days, we got to bed time with between 30-40 per cent charge remaining. That was after spending most of the evening testing the phone's performance (AKA playing hours of Temple Run 2). For heavy users, we suspect the Pixel would still get you to the end of a work day comfortably. Regardless of how long it lasts any specific user, the phone still charges really quickly, thanks to its Qualcomm Quick Charge 3.0 support. Google claims you can get seven hours worth of battery juice from plugging it in for just 15 minutes. Our experience says you should be able to fully charge it in little over an hour. Google Pixel Review: Camera Google claims its camera is among the best out there, pointing to the often-cited DxOMark mobile scores to prove to us all that it's the best camera on a smartphone to date. In our experience, it is good, but it's far from perfect. Pocket-lint One of its early flaws - which could presumably fixed with a software update - is its tendency to get the white balance wrong. In some photos, it applies a white balance as if lightning is incredibly cool, and overcompensates by making the scene more yellow. Almost as if an orange filter has been placed on the outside of the lens. We found this happened on both the front and rear facing camera. With that said, it is capable of producing some really great shots. Even without manual controls - which we've come to expect from top Android phones - it can create photographs with great colour and detail. Perhaps more impressive is that it captures them very quickly. There's almost zero waiting time between hitting the shutter button and the shot being captured. One element which surprised us was how well it coped in low-light situations. Even without manual exposure settings, and with the flash switched off, it can shoot sharp, blur-free images with great colour quality. Pocket-lint It sometimes has trouble focusing on objects close-up, so macro shots are hit and miss. With instances like this, and with the white balance issues, we can't help but feel a manual or "pro" mode with customisable ISO, shutter speed, white balance and focus would be hugely beneficial. But that's not the Pixel's focus: it's all about simplicity. Verdict The Google Pixel is the best Android experience available right now. For the first time we get to see exactly what Google has in mind for hardware design and features. Google is completely in control, and you can tell. Everything is tight, refined and polished to a degree we've never seen in a Nexus phone. Of course, this year, the Pixel arrives without the usual Nexus cheaper-than-flagship price. Indeed, the Pixel costs as much as an iPhone - and that could potentially come back to bite Google. On the other hand, with Samsung's reputation needing some serious work given Note 7 issues, the more-expensive-than-usual Android phone couldn't have come at a better time for Google. If you're after a 5-inch Android smartphone then there's simply nothing else on the market that compares to the Pixel. And because it's a Pixel, made by Google, you'll get prompt software updates, regularly, promptly and for at least a few years. You're not at the whim of a hardware manufacturer or a network operator.

 Google is opening a physical YouTube store in London Sam Shead Aug. 19, 2016, 4:03 AM 3,582 facebook linkedin twitter email print Business Insider UK/Sam Shead Google is set to open a physical YouTube store in London where popular YouTubers will be able to sell their merchandise to members of the public. The "Creator Store", due to open within the next four weeks, will be part of the new YouTube Space, which launched this week on the ground floor of Google's 11 storey office in King's Cross. The store will sell t-shirts, books, mugs, photo frames, and other items that have been dreamt up by designers and branding teams working with some of the most popular creators on YouTube. It will also be used for book signings and product releases. Darlington Howard, a YouTube senior programme strategist at Google, told Business Insider that all profits from the store will go to the creators. The YouTube Space also contains three studios for popular YouTubers to use, as well as a barista bar and a community area that can be accessed by the public. The space is designed to help YouTubers improve the quality of their videos, be it by offering them access to workshops or giving them access to equipment they wouldn't otherwise be able to get their hands on.

Google's new video chat app Duo is easy to use and might make you rethink using Hangouts for one-on-one video calls. By Jack Wallen | August 18, 2016, 11:46 PM PST RSS Comments Facebook Linkedin Twitter More Email Print Reddit Delicious Digg Pinterest Stumbleupon Google Plus Image: Jack Wallen Google's new communication apps might be surprising to some people, though it makes perfect sense...in a grand scheme kinda way. To cut to a very succinct chase, Google will have three communication apps: Allo for text-based communications Duo for one-on-one video chats Hangouts for business/enterprise video conferencing/chats Hangouts has been around for a long while; Allo has yet to be released; and Duo has come to light in both the Google Play Store and iTunes and is ready to become your go-to, one-on-one chat app. More about Mobility CIO Jury: 10 out of 12 tech leaders trust Samsung despite Galaxy Note7 failure IBM Watson is coming to the iPhone, and that's big news for business users Tech Pro Research: Social media policy Subscribe to TechRepublic's Mobile Enterprise newsletter But why do we need Duo? Weren't we all good using Hangouts as our all-in-one app? In Google's infinite wisdom, they didn't think so...and I believe Google was spot on. Why? FaceTime. No matter how big a fan I am of Google, one aspect of mobile I readily admit that Apple nailed was video chat. FaceTime makes the process of chatting with others in real-time video as simple as it gets. Google Hangouts, on the other hand, has a layer of complexity the average user often struggles with. Hence, the need for Google Duo. Duo simplifies what Hangouts started. Duo strips away the complexity of using Hangouts and follows in the footsteps of FaceTime. Now, Android users can enjoy video chat as quickly and easily as their Apple brethren. SEE: Why Google Duo will actually make you want to use video calling (CNET) Google finds simplicity in Duo Hangouts is one of the best video conferencing tools, especially when used in conjunction with the Hangout Toolbox. But for one-on-one video calls, Hangouts is a bit much. Even before the user begins chatting with another user, confusion could cause them to abort the call. Why? Knowing whether or not a user has Hangouts installed (or even a Google account to associate with Hangouts) can kick off the frustration. Now, anyone can install Duo without associating it with their Google Account; instead, Duo pairs with the device's phone number. Plus, Google Hangouts isn't adept at navigating poor connection quality. Duo, on the other hand, will automatically adjust the video resolution based on your network speed and reliability. If your connection drops all the way down to 2G, Duo will pause video and continue with audio only. Duo's interface is clutter-free. While connected, you only see the person you're chatting with and a small circle with what your device camera is seeing. If you tap the screen during a call, three circles will appear (Figure A): Camera rotate (rotate the camera from the front-facing to the rear-facing) Mute (mute the audio for the call) End (end the call) Figure A Having a conversation with myself. Image: Jack Wallen Knock Knock: A truly unique feature One of the more unique features of Duo is called Knock Knock. (Knock Knock only works on the Android iteration of Duo.) In an attempt to humanize the video chat experience, Google has created something really special. When a Duo video call comes in from someone in your contacts, you'll see a preview from their video feed instead of just a contact image. This way the person placing the call can better entice you (or guilt you) into taking the call (Figure B). Figure B Knock Knock in action. Image: Google Humanize yourself Clearly, Google is aiming to not only simplify but humanize the experience of video chat, and they should. No other feature of the smartphone is as "human" as the video chat. Because of this, Google aimed to strip away as much of the technology as possible and create a video chat app that does one thing and does it well: connect two humans (or more) via video. To that end, Google has succeeded brilliantly. Duo is exactly what Android has lacked for a very long time. If you've ever felt that Hangouts was either too complicated or overkill for a simple one-on-one video chat, Google has gone to great lengths to ease those frustrations. With Duo, you'll have seamless, simple, and personal video calls. When you need to turn up the complexity or hang out with more than one contact, you know where to turn.

CEO of Auckland-based search engine optimisation company and Google Adwords Premier Partner Ark Advance, Chris Price, said that the change would most likely result in an increase in the costs of Google advertising, and potentially reduce the value of organic search results. "Google has already moved its text Adwords off the side of the search results page, whilst also including an additional advertising slot for some search results, sparking more competition for listings at the top and bottom of the page. As a result, organic listings are further down the page, so that people often have to scroll down to the organic listings below the so-called fold. "It's hard to say what exactly the implications will be from Expanded Text Ads, but I think less space and less prominence for organic results. More companies will have to consider Adwords if they want to be found online, and they will have to pay more to compete. "I expect that companies will need to get their Adwords best practise spot on to be competitive," he said of the move, which is billed as the search engine giant's biggest change in 15 years. Mr Price said Expanded Text Ads are optimised for mobile, which is increasingly driving search volume across the network. "So instead of 25 characters for a heading and two 35 characters of description, you now have two 30-character headlines and one sizable 80-character description – organic listings may start to look dinky and less appealing by comparison. "This is a significant change to the Internet. New Zealand companies that rely on Google traffic for sales need to make sure they understand what is happening and how they will respond to the introduction of Expanded Text Ads." Mr Price said that bigger was not always better when it comes to the upsized ad format because the quality of the copywriting message is most important. He offers the following tips for companies that want to improve their conversion from Google Adwords: 1. Update your Google Adwords account to use this new ad format – text ads in the old form may look skinny and less appealing when compared to your competitors’ expanded alternatives. 2. Use the extra space to differentiate your business with a compelling message that will get people to click. 3. Remember that people go to Google looking to solve a problem. Credibility is high on the list, so use this extra space to mention your years of experience or the scope of the problems you have solved before. 4. Closely monitor the results of your Google advertising whilst this change rolls out. Now is not the time to “set and forget”. Jump on those campaigns that are failing fast and likewise capitalise on the winners that have caught your competitors napping. "New Zealand SMEs that rely on organic listings to generate sales leads may see a drop in traffic as organic becomes less prominent within the search results. Those that rely on Google Adwords may need to ensure that they have a strong sales message because competition will increase and clicks may come at a higher cost and become harder to find," Mr Price said.

By Agamoni Ghosh August 19, 2016 07:22 BST The Android N is expected to be seeding to select Nexus phones by next weekGoogle Google may start seeding the Android 7.0 Nougat OTA update to Nexus 6P and 5X owners as early as 22 August reveals a report by Canadian carrier Telus. It is not known if the update will only be available for select users for test runs. In any case, this is a first as Google has traditionally released the OS at a public event before seeding it to devices. According to a spreadsheet by Telus Forums accessed by 9to5Google, the Nexus 5X and Nexus 6P are scheduled to get the Android Nougat on 22 August. Coincidentally, LG is also planning to release Android N to select LG G5 owners in South Korea, on the same day. The important point to note, however, is that the update will only roll out to Telus-based phones — locked versions of Nexus 5X and 6P. Thus the actual OTA update for the rest of the regions is expected to be only after Google releases the final version of the OS publicly. As per reports, that may happen sometime in September or even October when Google is also expected to unveil the 2016 Nexus phone models code named Marlin and Sailfish. Google has always seeded its brand new OS updates first to Nexus phones and then to other phones. Some of the other phones in contention to receive the update right after Google Nexus phones include the freshly released Samsung Galaxy Note 7 and the LG G5.

The company released the first developer preview a full two months ahead of I/O conference giving developers a chance to play with it. Google also confirmed the official name of next Android version, Nougat, in June. Now, if a mobile carrier and a major Android OEM are to be believed, the all-new Android Nougat will be available to Nexus users starting Monday. According to Canadian mobile operator Telus, the final Android 7.0 Nougat build will start rolling out to the Huawei Nexus 6P and LG Nexus 5X beginning Monday. LG, on the other hand, in an official document has confirmed that Android 7.0 Nougat will be rolled out to Korean G5 units from Monday. With both companies mentioning the same day for availability of the final Android N release, it does appear as if Google may officially start seeding the final build in the time-frame.If this comes out to be true, we may also see the launch of the platform lead devices for Android Nougat to be announced on Monday itself. However, it is worth noting that Google is yet to announce a date for release. We can expect the final build of Android 7.0 Nougat to be available for the Nexus 6, Nexus 5X, Nexus 6P, Nexus 9, Pixel C devices, as well as General Mobile 4G Android One devices. The final Android Nougat public release will bring improvements like multi-window support, enhanced notifications, revamped doze, number blocking, and more.

Skip to content Search for: Search TechTastic Uncategorized Musings Of The Random Kind #4 Date: August 19, 2016Author: Aniket Sharma 0 Comments This post has taken a while to come. I haven’t written anything on TechTastic for the last few days. I was traveling with my family and was suffering from my post-travel-cold after that. The trip itself, with a hike in treacherous territory, fighting nature’s wrath while on said hike, auto races on uninhabited mountainsides and climbing across ledges to escape from rooms was more like a Mission Impossible movie than a vacation. But, that is a story for another time. Today, I take a look back at everything tech that has occupied my mind-space in the last 10 days. Our kind has become too dependent on technology, a statement not fitting of a technology blogger, but true. Don’t believe me? Spend 4 days without an internet connection and we’ll talk. With no WiFi or 3G, I had to go to a Cyber Cafe to get some work done, like it was the stone age! Ok, another reason this post is coming after a while, I was catching up with the happenings of the days when I wasn’t around. This is my 3rd week of freelancing and things are starting to fall into place. I, now, have a clear approach towards TechTastic and other projects and have a learnt a lot in the last 15 days (post with learnings coming up soon). Of course, a few of those aforementioned 15 days have been filled with self-doubt but with every passing day, the frequency of recurrence of such thoughts goes down as my confidence levels go up. I got mighty pissed with Apple’s default email client on iOS while I was on the trip. The search is completely broken and not once has it actually found the emails I was looking for, even after entering the right keywords. So, I have trashed the default Mail app for the time being and switched to Email by Easily.Do. It is fast, more efficient, works well with all my email accounts (another area where the default Mail app lags behind. It syncs emails from Gmail accounts intermittently only, not as they arrive. Easily.Do’s Email pushes them to the device as they come.), has a virtual assistant which groups relevant emails into categories like Travel, Entertainment, etc. while keeping the interface and interactions simple, unlike Inbox by Google. I’ll consolidate my thoughts about the app and share them after I use it a bit more. Speaking of efficient software, I really need slide-over multitasking on my iPhone 6s Plus. I have to jump through too many hoops to add notes to my article ideas when I get them while reading in another app. Slide-over multitasking works seamlessly on my iPad, I need it on my iPhone too. Come on Apple, add this to iOS 10. Google is beating you here with their split-screen multitasking in Android Nougat! And speaking of moving away from iOS’s default apps, after a will-they-won’t-they relationship for months, Google Photos and I have decided to give it another shot. Apple’s default iCould storage of 5 GB gets filled too fast, making trying to back up my photos to iCloud pointless (come on, Apple! It is 2016. 5 GB of free storage for someone who uses 4 Apple devices is unforgivable. Please do something about this!). Also, even though Apple has family sharing options (it is a stream of photos that family members decide to share with each other), my wife and I can’t access the photos on each other’s phones when we want to browse through our albums. Google Photos, from the looks of it, takes care of both those complaints. It supports unlimited backing up of photos after optimising photos to 16MP or limited backing up (against your Google Drive storage) for the originals. And, if we log into the same Google account, both, my wife and I, can back our photos up to the same place. The sync doesn’t seem to be very robust on iOS, though. I have to open the app repeatedly to ensure that all photos get synced. I’ll be testing the app out more and will share my views over the next few days. I have also decided to give sleep tracking another go. After mulling over my options to track sleep (Mi Band, Moov Now, Apple Watch), I have begun wearing my Apple Watch, with Sleep++ installed, to bed. I was worried that moving around while sleeping will lead to the Apple Watch banging against the bed or I’ll put my body weight on it and damage it, but it seems that I’m not as irresponsible when I sleep as I thought I was. The watch is a bit of extra weight and I feel it on my wrist when I’m sleeping. For all the talk about the Apple Watch’s battery lasting only a day, I still have 50% battery life after having it on my wrist for almost 24 hours, which have included tracking multiple workouts and sleep. The sleep data with Sleep++ has been quite accurate too. I’m going to continue testing this arrangement for another 4 days before I take a call about wanting to continue with it in the longer term. The first round of reviews for the Galaxy Note 7 are out and for the first time, it seems that we have a Samsung  phone phablet which is getting reviews and ratings better than iPhones. For the first time in a long time, a phone which isn’t iPhone sits at the top of The Verge’s smartphone ratings. Samsung seems to have gotten a lot of things right with the Galaxy Note 7 and though I’m more excited about the work Samsung is doing with their wearables and think that the OnePlus 3 is the best smartphone to buy this year, I’m going to nod my head with respect for Samsung’s latest phablet. Pushing the boundaries of smartphone design and features like Samsung has with the Note 7 only benefits us, the users, in the long run. Apple can’t take its position at the top for granted and with the new iPhones set to be announced in a few weeks, the battle for the top spot is just heating up. Speaking of Samsung, the Korean behemoth is set to announce the update to last year’s excellent smartwatch (with a rotating bezel as good, if not better than the Apple Watch’s digital crown), the Gear S3, by the end of this month. We might also see the new Apple Watch in the first couple of weeks of September. Needless to say, good time to be a wearables’ fan. My current wearable of choice, the Apple Watch, is surely helping me become fitter. I completed a 50-day streak of achieving my Move goal last week and I’m truly hooked. I have been ensuring that I fill my Activity Rings every day (even though I was sick for the last couple of days) and I’ve got to say, it feels great. 100-day streak, here I come! Google launched Duo, its video calling solution to take on FaceTime, on iOS and Android. Like a lot of people around, I fail to understand the need for it. Hangouts is a good service and has a very robust video calling solution. If anything, Google should focus on improving Hangouts. They are also going to launch Allo, their instant messaging service, soon. Again, I don’t see how it’ll make its mark against the iMessages, WhatsApps and Facebook Messengers of the world. Let’s hope that the people at Google wasting their time working on these apps know something about the video calling and instant messaging markets that we don’t. I finally found a game worth playing last week, Super Stickman Golf 3. It’s been a long time since I’ve played a game for more than 3 days at a stretch and SSG3 had me hooked for the better part of last week. Phew.. I thought I had lost the ability to enjoy games. All of these things aside, the biggest news making the rounds over the last 10 days is the Olympics and India’s low tally of medals in it, so far. Every athlete from our country out there in Rio is an expert in their sport and has put countless hours in training to be the best in their sport. Our pride and appreciation for their effort will inspire more kids and their parents to take sports other than cricket seriously and we’ll have even more world-class athletes who’ll win medals for our country. PV Sindhu, Sakshi Malik, Aditi Ashok and others, with their performances in the last few days, are inspirational figures for the next generation of athletes and it is heartening to see them treated that way by our media and us. Here’s hoping that the rest of the week brings more accolades for our athletes and our country. If you liked what you read, do like this post and leave your comments.

The big move for those in the former camp is the addition of Microsoft's SQL Server to Google Compute Engine, a decision the company says was made because “Our top enterprise customers emphasize the importance of continuity for their mission-critical applications.” It's not hard to unpack that sentence as Google having been told it has a fine cloud, but not so fine that users would re-tool applications to get into it. Adding SQL Server brings Google to parity with its main rivals, not a bad thing. The company is also trying to leapfrog those rivals with its own databases. It's now got three and they're all generally available. Cloud SQL is a cloudified cut of MySQL 5.7. Google reckons it's seriously fast and has slim latency. But then they would say that, wouldn't they? Cloud Datastore is a NoSQL document database and Cloud Bigtable is an Apache HBase client-compatible NoSQL wide-column database service. To give DBAs and developers more confidence, Google has also boosted maximum read/write IOPS from 15,000 to 25,000 in persistent solid state disk volumes and added the option to bring your own encryption keys to your cloud database. Another change to Google's cloud means the guessing game about just what kind of hardware lurks behind Google's Nearline service needs revisiting. The service used to offer between three and five seconds' latency when asked to retrieve an object. Google says it's reduced that to “times and throughput similar to Standard class objects.” That's handy for those wielding the databases mentioned above, and Google's BigQuery service because it means faster access to data deemed worthy of cheaper storage. ® Sponsored: The state of mobile security maturity Tips and corrections 1 Comment Whitepapers OpenStack brings agility to cloud platforms FICO needed an agile platform to provide its analytic cloud services to mid-sized businesses.

Now that future could extend to the trucking industry. Related News/Archive Uber's self-driving truck makes its first commercial delivery: beer 4 Weeks Ago Experts tell US agency to slow down on self-driving cars 7 Months Ago Tesla and Google take different roads to self-driving car 4 Months Ago On Thursday, Uber announced it had acquired Otto, a 90-person startup focused on developing self-driving truck technology that aims to upend the trucking and shipping industry. "More and more, the world of atoms is interacting with bits," Travis Kalanick, chief executive of Uber, said in a company blog post announcing the deal. "In order to provide digital services in the physical world, we must build sophisticated logistics, artificial intelligence and robotics systems that serve and elevate humanity." Uber wouldn't comment on the terms of the acquisition. But according to a person briefed on the deal, Uber will pay roughly 1 percent of its most current valuation — a sum worth about $680 million after the inclusion of its most recent fundraising — if the Otto team meets certain internal benchmarks. Otto's current shareholders will also be entitled to 20 percent of the profits of any self-driving trucking business the company is able to build over time. The move is the most recent indication of Uber's ambitions for autonomous vehicles that can provide services to both consumers and businesses. Self-driving vehicles would also help the company reduce its dependence on human drivers, which have proved to be the most expensive and legally vexing part of its growing business. And the acquisition of Otto adds to Uber's growing bench of experts in autonomous vehicle research, an area in which the company is drastically behind some of its largest competitors, including Google. Anthony Levandowski and Lior Ron, Otto's co-founders, were veterans of Google's car and mapping efforts before they started their company in January, and a number of former Google engineers work there. Levandowski has long been a key figure in autonomous vehicle research. In fact, he sold a startup called 510 Systems to Google when it began its self-driving car project. Over the past year, Uber has poached hundreds of former Google employees and has created a research facility in Pittsburgh dedicated to autonomous driving technology. A number of the researchers working there were hired from Carnegie Mellon University, where much of the early research on the technology was done. Uber also announced the first fruits of its autonomous vehicle effort Thursday: a partnership with Volvo, which will provide the first jointly developed vehicles to offer self-driving Uber rides on the streets of Pittsburgh. In a test starting later this month, Uber users in Pittsburgh will be able to hail self-driving Volvo XC90 sport utility vehicles to get around the city. The two companies are also working together to develop a fully autonomous car ready for road deployment within five years and have committed $300 million to the effort. Uber is not alone in its ambitions. Earlier this week, Ford Motor Co. promised to develop its own fleet of autonomous vehicles for road use by 2021, to be deployed in a ride-hailing network as well. Lyft, another ride-hailing startup, has similar ambitions, and is working closely with General Motors, a major investor in the company, to create a self-driving automobile. The partnership between Volvo and Uber is not exclusive, and Uber has made it clear that it wants to work with automakers rather than build its own vehicles.

Xooglers A gathering spot for ex-Googlers to reminisce and comment on the latest developments in search. Wednesday, March 16, 2011 Brilliant! Love it! Now, could you change it all around? Final installment of the Dilbert logo saga, revised and reposted from the Xooglers archive. ******************* The script Scott sent us for the Dilbert Google doodle seemed to pick up nicely on Sergey’s suggestion. In the first panel, the pointy-haired boss (PHB) sits next to the regular Google logo and says to his staff, "We need a new logo by Friday. Any ideas?" The next day, the “G" and "O” at the front of the logo are screened back so that they appear much paler than the last four letters. Dilbert says, "We could drop the first two letters." The PHB answers, "That's a no go idea." On day three, the last three letters are faded back and Dilbert says, "We could shorten the logo to three letters." The Boss says, "No, Goo isn't sticky." Those three panels were easily approved and became part of the final doodle published on the site. What didn’t make the cut were the fourth panel, in which Wally says, "The logo needs more sex appeal. I'll show you..." and the fifth panel, featuring Wally standing in front of the "OO" part of the logo as if the O’s are, as Scott put it, “his gigantic man-breasts,” while Dilbert says, "I find this disturbing." There is something inherently amusing in the notion of man-breasts. As someone whose own sense of humor runs to Mel Brooks and Dave Barry, I wasn’t terribly offended by the concept, but I suspected others would be. I was right. After sending it around to other Googlers, questions were raised about how it would play internationally, the use of the word “sex,” and the appearance of breasts (male or female) on our signature page. Interestingly, but not surprisingly, none of those objections came from Sergey, who found the concept pretty funny and opined that we shouldn’t be afraid to take a few risks. The irony of acting like one of the clueless companies Dilbert lampoons was not lost on him. I’d like to say that I fought for the concept and damned the shortsighted, small-minded philistines who couldn’t see the greatness inherent in Scott’s original idea. I’d like to say that, but then I would be lying. Frankly, I was relieved that I wasn’t the only one nervous about where Scott was taking us. I would find it amusing to see this in his strip, but not on our branded homepage, which we were showing to millions of people around the globe. They hadn’t come to Google expecting to see slightly risqué humor. They’d come to find information. My sensitivity to the subjectiveness of humor wasn't always as finely attuned. On more than one occasion in my career, what I had thought was funny had turned out to be less than amusing to others. I made fun of bagpiping neighbors in a radio spot for the Mercury News that brought the wrath of a lunatic Celtic rights advocate raining down upon me. I wrote a newspaper ad headline for KQED FM that said “Ed Meese is history” during the station’s broadcast of live coverage of the Senate Iran Contra hearings. The station president didn’t buy my argument that it referred to the fact that Meese’s testimony had ended the day before and we were now covering the next witness. He seemed pretty peeved when I kept trying to persuade him to run it anyway. And while at an ad agency, I pissed off the descendants of California’s most famous gold miner with an ad for a business school claiming that “When John Sutter found gold, he lost a fortune. He could have used an MBA from USF.” The editor of the San Francisco Chronicle sent a personal complaint to my boss at the Mercury News during a newspaper war for subscribers after the close of a smaller local paper. He felt my flyer pointing out that there were only two Peninsula-related stories in their paper compared to the Merc’s two dozen was hitting below the belt. He seemed particularly ticked over the line, “Yesterday the Chronicle gave you two bits for your 35 cents.” And then there was the time I wanted to promote the depth of news stories in the Mercury News online archive. I browsed hundreds of stories and came up with a piece reviewing the food at local company cafeterias, including Silicon Graphics. Turns out they had served rabbit once, so I stuck a drawing of a bunny in an ad that made reference to the menu. The next morning, PETA started picketing SGI’s headquarters. After a series of snafus in the newspaper’s composing room led to the ad running twice more after I had promised the publisher it wouldn’t, I got to write a personal letter of apology to SGI’s CEO and barely held onto my job. (Ironically, I was to eat many meals in that very cafeteria when Google took over SGI's headquarters). So, let’s say I wasn’t all that anxious to step out on the bleeding edge of comedy again. The upshot was that I had to go back to Scott and ask him to remove the man-breasts. He wasn’t all that happy about it, but consummate professional that he is, he was back within the hour with a modified version. In this one, Dogbert says, "The logo needs more sex appeal. I'll show you..." The next day, Dogbert peers through the "OO" part of the logo as if they’re his glasses. Dilbert says, "I find this disturbing." The “sex” set off alarm bells again for one senior manager, which led Sergey to start making noises about going back to the original idea. I volunteered to go back to Scott yet again and ask for a third version. I really didn’t want to do it, because it’s never fun to tell a creative person working for free that their idea just isn’t good enough. (I’d done that at a previous job when a world-renowned ad agency wrote some pro-bono ads for me that were way out of my comfort zone). I walked a very fine line with Scott. I told him how funny the first idea was and that we were sorry that it wasn’t appropriate for our audience. I told him the second idea was fine, but not as funny as the first, which was our fault for bringing a corporate mentality to the project. I gently asked if he’d be willing to go to phase three. He said he’d sleep on it. In the morning, he sent us the version that actually ran. He also asked that he be allowed to run the rejected ideas on his website, which was fine with me, though I’m not sure he actually posted more than a description of the man-breast idea. Of course, everyone loved the new idea and I was once again the hero, not the goat. Well, to everyone except my boss, who didn’t think it was all that funny, even in it’s third version. And then we posted the first day’s strip. The Googlers-misc mailing list began humming like Zappa’s dynamo. Our internal only mailing list called Googlers-misc was the place for anyone at Google to share their thoughts on any activity in which the company was engaged. There had already been an active thread proposing a homepage tribute to a soon-to-be-released science fiction movie popular with geeks of all ages when Dilbert put in his first appearance. That thread quickly became focused on the dark side of our Dilbert logo and the great disturbance it was creating among our users. Or at least, the users who happened to have friends working at Google. The concerns varied from the fear that we were seriously planning to change our logo forever to the sense that we had sold out the homepage to promote a blatantly commercial enterprise. And the avatar of that latter evil, the cool hard ceramic proof point of that, was, yes, you guessed it: the mug. I won’t bore you with the details of the disdain Googlers heaped upon the Google-Dilbert mug and their concerns about the message it was sending to our loyal users, but suffice it to say that it was heartfelt, voluminous and incapable of being ignored. Google was still a relatively small company at this point and any time more than three Googlers were unhappy about something, it required a response. CNET made things worse by running a story that included the line, “Part of the fun in business is making money, of course: Google plans to sell T-shirts with the Dilbert logo, as well as coffee mugs." The t-shirt reference was untrue and was eventually corrected, but the damage was done. It cast the whole initiative as a profit-driven grab for cash. So I went to Sergey with the suggestion supported by many staffers that we give the proceeds for the mug sale to charity, which we would make clear on the site. He agreed and suggested something related to cancer research. And that’s why I placed a call to the American Cancer Society to let them know we’d be sending them a check for more than $11,000. As for the mugs, they’re no longer available since it was to be a limited time offer. I have one, as do 400 other Googlers to whom we gave them during TGIF. I took that to mean that at least some Googlers didn’t object to seeing Dilbert adorning our logo. In the aftermath, we were approached by many artists, cartoonists and brand managers, who felt the door was now opened to promoting their products on what was becoming one of the web’s most popular homepages. We turned them all down, because we now had empirical evidence that any commercialization or even perceived commercialization of the homepage logo would be detrimental to the brand we were building. What did I take away from this whole experience? Four things: Brand managers are not always the people closest to the true nature of the brand, nor the best able to see what might be construed as damaging to its integrity. Having free-flowing, unregulated communication within a company can be distracting, annoying and damaging to one’s ego, but it lets you know pretty quickly when you’ve stepped across a line you shouldn’t have crossed. Expect that there will be unexpected ramifications from even the most innocuous seeming initiatives. That shouldn’t stop you from moving ahead, but you should be ready to respond to the weirdness and be flexible about the ways in which you do it. Cartoons should never be written by a committee. A postscript (2006): I watched Google launch its recent Da Vinci Code puzzle promotion with interest. I think it was handled well and avoided the dreaded Dilbert effect by making the promotion opt-in and tying it to a specific Google service (homepage personalization). The challenge also fit Google’s branding strategy of promoting puzzle solving and smart thinking, which is tied to both the brand value and Google’s recruitment efforts (more on that another time). They didn’t change the homepage logo and they didn’t sell mugs. I’d be surprised if they didn’t get some mail about tying to a controversial story that’s banned in some parts of the world, but that’s one of those eggs you have to break if you’re going to make an omelet. With millions of users, someone’s always going to be pissed off about something. I hope there was a Googlers-misc thread about whether the promotion marked a sellout to corporate interests and the death knell of the old Google, but that kind of debate is probably a relic of Google’s past. Still, an unmoderated discussion about core-values among 6,000 plus bright, opinionated, articulate individuals would likely be highly entertaining, as long as you’re not Google’s new brand and entertainment manager Dylan Casey. Dylan, I feel your pain. Posted by Doug at 8:54 PM Email ThisBlogThis!Share to TwitterShare to FacebookShare to Pinterest 2 comments: Mike Pascale said...

Ladera Ranch, CA, United States - August 18, 2016 /MarketersMedia/ -- Reviews are essential to online business prosperity. Reviews show new and potential customers what the experience of previous customers has been like. Great reviews will encourage people to buy from a site, where no reviews would require a huge leap of faith. Review Wave is a new start-up that understands the power of reviews, and wants to help more businesses leverage them. As such, it has launched a brand new Google Reviews WordPress plugin that enables businesses to crop reviews directly from Google + and Yelp, then publish them on their own site. The new plugin is quick to install, easy to use and completely free of charge. The tool is the ultimate answer for anyone who has wondered How To Get Google Reviews on their site. It allows individuals to import their reviews from Yelp and Google Plus, then curate them accordingly for maximum promotional use. Individuals can promote their best reviews, allow positive reviews to be seen, and even hide less positive reviews, to create the overall first impression they are looking for. What's more, Review Wave has plans to be able to help businesses get even more Google + and Yelp reviews. The plugin encourages new customers to use these sites to drop their feedback, creating a momentum effect that can help businesses get the number of positive reviews they need to achieve full customer trust. A spokesperson for Review Wave explained, "The new tools we have created are just the beginning, but they are already a great leap forward in terms of what's possible for businesses. There has never been an easier way to collect, collate and present online reviews. We plan to increase the number of sources our tool can pull from, while simultaneously adding more new features that will serve to further optimize customer experience, interaction, and importantly, recruitment. This will help more businesses get more reviews than ever before." About Review Wave: Review Wave is a start up software company founded with a mission to empower businesses to get real customer feedback from real customers, and a passion to help those businesses improve their service in real time, to improve their online reputation as a result. Their suite of tools now enables companies to syndicate their Google and Yelp reviews to their website for free.

Panoramics Photos Rec.humor.funny Joke Site Robocar Bog Twitter Best of Blog Brad's Home Robocars.com Home » Topic » Robocars Uber buys Otto, folks leave Google, Ford goes big, Tesla dumps MobilEye Submitted by brad on Thu, 2016-08-18 15:18. Robocars The past period has seen some very big robocar news. Real news, not the constant “X is partnering with Y” press releases that fill the airwaves some times. Uber has made a deal to purchase Otto, a self-driving truck company I wrote about earlier founded by several friends of mine from Google. The rumoured terms of the deal as astronomical — possibly 1% of Uber’s highly valued stock (which means almost $700M) and other performance rewards. I have no other information yet on the terms, but it’s safe to say Otto was just getting started with ambitious goals and would not have sold for less than an impressive amount. For a company only 6 months old, the rumoured terms surpass even the amazing valuation stories of Cruise and Zoox. While Otto has been working on self-driving technology for trucks, any such technology can also move into cars. Uber already has an active lab in Pittsburgh, but up to now has not been involved in long haul trucking. (It does do local deliveries in some places.) There are many startups out there calling themselves the “Uber for Trucks” and Otto has revealed it was also working on shipping management platform tools, so this will strike some fear into those startups. Because of my friendship with Otto’s team, I will do more commentary when more details become public. In other Uber news, Uber has announced it will sell randomly assigned Uber rides in their self-driving vehicles in Pittsburgh. If your ride request is picked at random (and because it’s in the right place) Uber will send one of their own cars to drive you on your ride, and will make the ride free, to boot. Of course, there will be an Uber safety driver in the vehicle monitoring it and ready to take over in any problem or complex situation. So the rides are a gimmick to some extent, but if they were not free, it would be a sign of another way to get customers to pay for the cost of testing and verifying self-driving cars. The free rides, however, will probably actually cause more people to take Uber rides hoping they will win the lottery and get not simply the free ride but the self-driving ride. GM announced a similar program for Lyft — but not until next year. Ford also goes all-in, but with a later date Ford has announced it wants to commit to making unmanned capable taxi vehicles, the same thing Uber, Google, Cruise/GM, Zoox and most non-car companies want to make. For many years I have outlined the difference between the usual car company approaches, which are evolutionary and involve taking cars and improving their computers and the approaches of the non-car companies which bypass all legacy thinking (mostly around ADAS) to go directly to the final target. I call that “taking a computer and putting wheels on it.” It’s a big and bold move for Ford to switch to the other camp, and a good sign for them. They have said they will have a fleet of such vehicles as soon as 2021. Other companies have announced plans to go for unmanned capable taxi vehicles, particularly Daimler and BMW, but they still maintain active “evolutionary” projects which hope to build on their prior ADAS work. Velodyne The other big news is that Ford, together with Baidu have made a $150M investment in Velodyne. Velodyne has been for a decade the primary supplier of LIDARs for robocar research projects, but their LIDARs are research instruments, high performance at high cost. In the meantime, other companies (such as Quanergy, for whom I am an advisor) have been pushing to make better priced LIDARs for real production. The Velodynes have been the right choice, because it is smart to research with what’s expensive today, knowing it will get cheap in the future. Baidu’s test cars have had Velodynes on them, but there were recent rumours of Baidu experimenting with alternatives to LIDAR, but this investment may counter those rumours. This investment will move Velodyne more to a lower cost production unit, though at present at a higher cost than the solid-state plans of Quanergy and some others. Google Departures Otto included a few people from Google’s car team. It was also recently revealed that Chris Urmson, who had run the team for most of its existence and was moved to “CTO” after the arrival of John Krafcik, has departed. I worked for Chris but he has not told me his reason for departure. In general, Google’s car team has gotten huge, and the recently departed people are mostly folks who were among the first 20 on the team. This may simply be a sign of massive expansion, I have not heard much to credit the idea that there is some sort of internal chaos. In addition, deals like the Otto deal will certainly cause people to consider if they want to work for a big corporation or break out on their own. MobilEye A few weeks ago, MobilEye issued a press release that they would not be supplying the next generation of their EyeQ chips to Tesla. The EyeQ4 is a great deal more sophisticated than the EyeQ3 that Telsa uses, and Tesla even uses an older version with a more limited set of features — including, most famously, the inability to detect things like cross traffic. Since MobilEye announced it, it seems like it was their decision (You don’t usually issue a press release to say you have been dumped by a smaller customer.) It caused their stock to take a quick big hit (Disclaimer, I own a small amount) on the day of the announcement, but it recovered reasonably well. Tesla’s stock was not affected. Tesla folks have always claimed that they only made minimal use of ME’s functionality, and that the real special sauce was theirs. ME folks have claimed the opposite. This break-up will settle that question, and presumably Tesla has been working on alternatives for a while as they don’t seem to be in much panic about it. Tesla has made announcements of plans for their new hardware and those plans look very similar to the EyeQ4, so they must have had their own parallel research underway. » brad's blog Question Submitted by Bill D (not verified) on Thu, 2016-08-18 16:41. Brad, Any thoughts about the MIT / DARPA announcement they might be able to design lidars on a chip to be priced at around $10 each Does that seem feasible to you? Significant? http://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-talk/semiconductors/optoelectronics/mit-li... » reply Solid state Submitted by brad on Fri, 2016-08-19 00:24. This project is attempting to do a solid state LIDAR, which is also the goal of Quanergy. Quanergy is much further along, and others hope to do the same thing. The $10 price point is when you are making many millions of the chip, and yes, anything that can go on one chip in those quantities can get a cost that low, though usually you add a few other things beyond the chip. Whether it is this, or Quanergy, or other companies working on it, low cost LIDAR is definitely coming, and will be used on all robocars, I predict, even Tesla (though Elon has sworn otherwise.) Or at least it will until there is some remarkable breakthrough in computer vision. Which is not impossible, but not here yet. I expect the cheap lidars are sooner. But if you have cheap lidar and cheap camera you use both, of course, at least for the first decade. » reply Current cost of lidar Submitted by Bo Nordlin (not verified) on Fri, 2016-08-19 03:13. Brad, I highly appreciate your writing. What are the current cost of lidars in an autonomous vehicle, and what has been the typical yearly price reduction so far? » reply Current cost Submitted by brad on Sun, 2016-08-21 18:09. There is no standard LIDAR. Velodyne makes several products ranging from $8,000 to $75,000. Valeo sells a simple 4 plane designed by Ibeo for $250 but it’s not really suitable for self-driving. Quanergy has a $1,000 8 laser unit being tested by some automakers. There are a few other research ones out there. Many companies have this in development, they only just figured it out a while ago. It is reasonable to expect that suitable LIDARs will be under $250, perhaps far under, but you may need more than one. » reply Quanergy et al chip based LiDAR RANGE Submitted by Rutt Bridges (not verified) on Sun, 2016-08-21 18:59. Brad, While I have seen multiple stories about chip-based LiDAR (mostly re: Quanergy), the one thing I haven't see is a spec on range. While the cost-effectiveness of these units could be a real breakthrough for driverless vehicles, if the range is under 100 feet their application will be quite limited. Have you seen or heard any quotes on range? » reply Range Submitted by brad on Mon, 2016-08-22 03:25. Range for LIDARs is more a function of their light frequency and eye safety rules. You can’t emit so much power that it would be dangerous to the eye. At that maximum power, you can go about 100m on a dark object and still be seen coming back (against the sun.) You can go further on brighter objects, and most objects are brighter, but you have to focus on that minimum range. » reply More sensitive lidar Submitted by Anonymous (not verified) on Fri, 2016-10-28 16:33. Brad, there's an Israeli company working on more sensitive lidar sensors with a better range. » reply That is true Submitted by brad on Fri, 2016-10-28 16:40.

Apple just bought Turi (nee Dato, nee GraphLab). In doing so they acquired the GraphLab Create and Turi Distributed platforms, nice toolkits that accelerate common Machine Learning tasks. However, those don't seem to fit with Apple's product portfolio at all. However they also acquired 50+ data scientists, most with PhDs. To me it looks like perhaps it's an acqui-hire, so they can use those resources on their internal ML projects (cough-self-driving-car-cough). Disclaimer: I'm an evangelist for Turi (i.e. a run a users' group for them, for which I get no cash compensation but do get the occasional perk like a conference ticket). However, I have no special knowledge about their business internals and this is speculation on my part. » reply Tesla & maps Submitted by Anonymous (not verified) on Sat, 2016-08-20 11:22. Hi, have you heard any news on tesla negotiating with a global mapmaker?

Hi Brad Given the pace at which taxi firms are trying to develop autonomous cars and autonomous car developers are increasingly foreseeing a car-on-demand model for the SDC operations, it remains to be seen how car owners/operators will prevent people from misusing the cars - Misusing meaning everything from pure vandalism and dirtying the car to outright car jacking/ using as a self-guided ballistic missile? Would you know if these firms have something in mind to prevent such incidents? » reply Rental cars Submitted by brad on Mon, 2016-09-12 11:12. Are these issues different from the issues with rental cars (Hertz) or carshare (Zipcar)? If they don’t have a wheel, you can’t use them as a missile (unless you physically alter the car, which again you can do with any rental car.) » reply You are right! Autonomous Submitted by Bejoy John (not verified) on Fri, 2016-09-16 02:45. You are right! Autonomous cars as missiles seem to be less of a threat. But when it comes to rental cars or car share, at the end of the day, the guy who takes it out has to face the owner of the car when handing it back. That leaves them kind of "obliged" to take care of the car in their custody, which is what prevents people from vandalizing the vehicle. Even a contract to take care of the car is useless if the car owner isn't around to track vandalism and take defaulters to task. Compare that to public toilets where no one is watching you use it and you don't have to face the owner(the govt., public utility cos). So people do not care so much and just use and leave it as they feel. Even facing another user doesn't seem to have the same effect as facing the owner. I see an analog in current business models of autonomous cars - nobody is watching you use it and the car just goes to the next guy who wants to use it. That made me wonder if such consumer behavior is already factored in (but maybe not announced) by autonomous car companies or is it that measures to counter such behavior need to be developed. » reply I have a number of articles on this topic Submitted by brad on Fri, 2016-09-16 10:36. Mostly related to the privacy problems because taxi owners will indeed want cameras to stop damage (mostly accidental) to cars as well as people leaving their stuff in them. My current model is as you leave (to stop the meter running) you flip the lever on the camera’s cover, it takes a photo after you are out, and compares it to the photo before you got in, and if there’s a difference, it is examined. In most cases it’s, “You left your bag in the car” but sometimes it’s “You spilled your drink or puked” and the car goes to the car wash and you get the bill. » reply Comment viewing options Flat list - collapsedFlat list - expandedThreaded list - collapsedThreaded list - expanded Date - newest firstDate - oldest first 10 comments per page30 comments per page50 comments per page70 comments per page90 comments per page150 comments per page200 comments per page250 comments per page300 comments per page Select your preferred way to display the comments and click "Save settings" to activate your changes.

Asks Universal Media Online By Published: Aug 18, 2016 9:05 p.m. ET Share Small and medium sized businesses, and entrepreneurs alike celebrated with one voice as Google Hangouts allowed communication en masse. Even the use of Webinar services tapped into Hangouts. As the announcement hits that Google is discontinuing its free Hangouts on Air service (now to be bundled in with YouTube Live, where does that leave small businesses that depended on Hangouts to run webinars for sales, marketing and training? BRISBANE, Australia, Aug. 18, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Universal Media Online reports: As Google themselves reported in their post on the google support page, Hangouts On Air, the popular service used by many small business owners and entrepreneurs to run Webinars and group meetings will no longer be available to schedule events.

Now, a new leak may have uncovered when Android 7.0 Nougat will be available to Nexus users. A short schedule of upcoming software updates coming to Android were published by a community manager at Telus, the Canadian mobile network carrier. The schedule shows that the Huawei Nexus 6P and the LG nexus 5X under the Telus network will be receiving the Android Nougat update on Aug. 22, which is this coming Monday. Telus will be bringing Android Nougat to the Nexus 6P and Nexus 5X on August 22. Photo: Telus Community Forum Page Related Stories Nokia To Announce 3 Or 4 Android Devices Is Google Duo The Death Of FaceTime, Skype And What Have You? This type of leak usually doesn’t get picked up, but Telus has a history of providing very accurate schedules for Android software updates, as pointed out by Android Police. Another factor to consider is that Google is already preparing to announce its new Nexus devices, which are usually unveiled some time after the latest version of Android is released. Google’s Nexus devices for this year, built by HTC, are expected to be announced sometime in September and will be available in stores by the first week of October. Google has been consistently releasing the newest version of Android between August and October. Past reports have indicated that Google will be releasing Android Nougat a lot earlier, so an Aug. 22 release date isn’t too farfetched, especially for the Google-owned Nexus 6P and the Nexus 5X. As for users with non-Nexus devices, they should expect the Android Nougat update to arrive a lot later. The Galaxy Note 7 is suspected to be one of the first handsets to get the upgrade, but it might reach the phablet sometime in November, according to BGR. If this latest leak is accurate, Google should be making an official announcement soon. However, it’s important to note that the schedule published by Telus is listed as “approximate and subject to change.” Join the Discussion Most Read Stay connected to the biggest stories unfolding in technology.

Duo is all about ease of use. There’s no separate account to create, no need to build a new contact list: the app can use your phone’s contact list already, and start a video call with a click. A “Knock Knock” feature shows users live video of any caller before they pick up, giving a quick idea of where they are and what they’re doing. The app does its best to keep you connected, seamlessly switching between mobile data and wifi as necessary, and automatically adjusting resolution to match available bandwidth. Google hasn’t forgotten about security, either– end-to-end encryption keeps snoopers out, even on insecure wifi hotspots. So, Google competes with FaceTime. And, umm, Hangouts, sort-of. Which means their strategy for the future is, uh… (We’ll get back to you when we’ve figured that one out.) Google Duo is available now for Android and iOS.

CEO of Auckland-based search engine optimisation company and Google Adwords Premier Partner Ark Advance, Chris Price, said that the change would most likely result in an increase in the costs of Google advertising, and potentially reduce the value of organic search results. “Google has already moved its text Adwords off the side of the search results page, whilst also including an additional advertising slot for some search results, sparking more competition for listings at the top and bottom of the page. As a result, organic listings are further down the page, so that people often have to scroll down to the organic listings below the so-called fold. “It’s hard to say what exactly the implications will be from Expanded Text Ads, but I think less space and less prominence for organic results. More companies will have to consider Adwords if they want to be found online, and they will have to pay more to compete. “I expect that companies will need to get their Adwords best practise spot on to be competitive,” he said of the move, which is billed as the search engine giant’s biggest change in 15 years. Mr Price said Expanded Text Ads are optimised for mobile, which is increasingly driving search volume across the network. “So instead of 25 characters for a heading and two 35 characters of description, you now have two 30-character headlines and one sizable 80-character description – organic listings may start to look dinky and less appealing by comparison. “This is a significant change to the Internet. New Zealand companies that rely on Google traffic for sales need to make sure they understand what is happening and how they will respond to the introduction of Expanded Text Ads.” Mr Price said that bigger was not always better when it comes to the upsized ad format because the quality of the copywriting message is most important. He offers the following tips for companies that want to improve their conversion from Google Adwords: 1. Update your Google Adwords account to use this new ad format – text ads in the old form may look skinny and less appealing when compared to your competitors’ expanded alternatives. 2. Use the extra space to differentiate your business with a compelling message that will get people to click. 3. Remember that people go to Google looking to solve a problem. Credibility is high on the list, so use this extra space to mention your years of experience or the scope of the problems you have solved before. 4. Closely monitor the results of your Google advertising whilst this change rolls out. Now is not the time to “set and forget”. Jump on those campaigns that are failing fast and likewise capitalise on the winners that have caught your competitors napping. “New Zealand SMEs that rely on organic listings to generate sales leads may see a drop in traffic as organic becomes less prominent within the search results. Those that rely on Google Adwords may need to ensure that they have a strong sales message because competition will increase and clicks may come at a higher cost and become harder to find,” Mr Price said.

Time is of the essence, and you couldn’t book a hotel room before you left. Like most hotel bookings made from a mobile device, you need a room to check into today. NB: This is a guest viewpoint by Herndon Hasty and first appeared on the Koddi blog. You conduct a search for hotels near you, and instead of a big block of local search results, Google serves up a couple of the nearest options to where you are as a large, card-style result. Each card tells you not just where the hotel is, its review ratings, and the nightly rate, but the size of the bed, and square footage of the room. The card lets you book with two or three quick taps right from the search result. Now imagine that that outcome cost the hotel chain nothing but the time needed to add some code to its webpages. We got a little closer to that potential future this month, with an intriguing release from a Google-backed project. Hospitality brands gained some new ways to share information with search engines in the latest Schema.org release, allowing hoteliers to specify everything from what kinds of rooms are on offer to whether they’re pet friendly. These enhancements to the markup standards, which Google uses to enhance a site’s search results, set the stage for travel shoppers to more fully assess what chains, single-location B&B’s, OTAs and even peer-to-peer networks like Airbnb have to offer directly on search results pages – and maybe even someday book from there as well. Schema.org is the main driver of enhanced search results in engines like Google, which pull in anything from prices and reviews to event dates and recipe instructions directly into your page’s results. More than 10 million sites use Schema.org to markup their web pages. It’s a standard way of organizing and calling out information on a webpage – kind of like a data feed built right onto a webpage – either through special markup around key on-page content or meta data. Search engines can then more easily identify those key points, and use those insights to better rank the page in its natural search results and pull some of those key points into your search results. There are at present more than 25 ways to appear in Google, many of which are driven by this markup. It’s been a key addition for hospitality and travel sites to make their results stand out in natural search results, even as the real estate that used to be dedicated to them has gradually been taken up by local results and booking modules. From time to time, the group who manages it allows changes, expansions and updates to its structure – which can be found at – you guessed it – Schema.org. And this week’s changes were heavily concentrated on accommodations. There’s now a structure to describe nearly every aspect of your hotel, *room,* and offer that a customer would need to make a purchase decision. Already able to differentiate yourself between a hotel, motel, or hostel, options for Resort, Bed and Breakfast or Camping Grounds were introduced. There is now a structure not just for the hotel but for the types of accommodations that are available, from rooms and suites to houses and camp pitches. These each can include parameters for the square footage of the space, and both the size and number of beds. Special features like whether a meeting room is attached or if pets are allowed can also be shared. …all on top of the existing capabilities of sharing price, reviews, location, photos, and other important sales features. As Brad Brewer, CEO of Brewer Digital Marketing has put it, “Hotel Rich Cards have the potential to completely change the face of booking in natural search.” While it still takes development time, the JSON-LD implementation of Schema.org that Google has been embracing as of late actually make it a much faster job than it used to be. Structured data will only become more important to ranking and how you appear in search results – often as important as where you appear in rankings – and those who embrace it and keep up with the latest options will reap the rewards of a bigger presence while everyone else is catching up. Of course, the exact impact of these additions will depend entirely on what Google, other search engines, and even apps that can crawl this data choose to do with them. On a basic level, sharing information through Schema.org code use is correlated with better rankings, though not yet a fully proven connection, so building these new structures in could be beneficial for traffic, even if they’re never used in another way. As Google engineers have a chance to plot how to use these points, the information could be used for anything from a spin on the traditional enhanced search result, to a larger sidebar Knowledge Graph-style result – or something completely new. Did I mention that Schema.org can also be used to initiate an action? For example, using a certain variety of it on your homepage can add a search bar to your natural search sitelink results, and send visitors that use that search bar to search results directly on your website. If Google can trigger a search based on the code, why not a booking? We’re probably quite a way off from that, and we can hardly count on Google giving away anything as lucrative as kicking off a booking for free. But given the capabilities that Schema.org just brought to the hospitality industry, it’s a time to dream big – and to act now to stay ahead of the pack. NB: This is a guest viewpoint by Herndon Hasty and first appeared on the blog of Koddi, a company that helps hotels manage their Hotel Price Ads and meta search advertising on metasearch.

Features Reviews Phones Android iPhone Windows Phone Apps Computers Laptops Lenovo Tablets Windows Tutorials Events More Audio Crowfunding Design/Concepts Gadgets Gaming General Photo/Video Web Ubergizmo in French Ubergizmo in German Ubergizmo in Italian Ubergizmo in Spanish Why Do OEMs Create Custom Android Skins? By Hubert Nguyen on 08/18/2016 17:47 PST Huawei has a proprietary interface called EMUI for Emotion UI While most users don’t mind so much about the kind of Android skin* used by handset makers, many people wonder why phone makers don’t keep Google’s default Android skin (user interface). Although commonly called “skins,” some proprietary Android versions used by OEMs vary greatly depending on how “deep” into Android the modifications are made. Some changes are cosmetic in nature while others go much deeper into the operating system. Regardless, here are the reasons: *Android “skins” are also called “themes.” They are distributed in app called “launchers,” because other apps are launched from them. 1/ Differentiation The LG G3 introduced a very simplified UI in HiDPI Being “different” is the most important reason for phone makers to have a proprietary user interface. This is particularly critical when companies don’t want to compete only based on hardware technicalities. To be fair, hardware quality does have a profound impact in key areas such as camera, quality, display and industrial design. However, user interface and user experience aren’t proportionally better depending on the quality of the hardware. Since most phones are priced reasonably, if not outright cheaply, hardware alone simply cannot be the main preoccupation for OEMs. Manufacturers try to identify and isolate weaknesses in the stock OS or optimize for specific use cases. From there a specific interface is tailored to gain an edge – or so is the plan. Maintaining a custom skin is an expensive proposition for the phone builder, and it puts a major strain on the OEM’s engineering resources, so this decision should never be taken lightly. 2/ User retention Once an OEM has convinced a customer to buy a phone, the aim is to repeat a sale down the road. Humans are creatures of habits, and many people would rather not learn a new interface. This offers phone makers a good chance of “retaining” customers that were acquired previously, possibly at great cost (of marketing). If one’s Android skin is sufficiently “sticky” and gets people to ask for it, it’s the holy grail for a device maker. There are several ways to go at it, but large OEMs use their distribution power (Samsung, LG, Huawei, etc.) and pretty much provide quality hardware that makes it worth for the user to either like or tolerate the skin. Smaller players like OnePlus and Meizu can try adding value by asking users what UI they want, and by preloading fewer applications by default (aka bloatware). The goal is to have people desire one’s custom skin to factor it in the purchase decision. 3/ Include additional services The Samsung Touchwiz interface powers most of Samsung’s Android phones A custom Android skin often comes along with exclusive apps. This is a good opportunity for OEMs to include services that they hope will make their platform “sticky.” For example, you may like their specific version of mobile payments, or maybe you used their app store and now have bought a bunch of apps and games that you want to access in the future. Maybe you are using their cloud services to store some data — all of this could be lost or harder to access if you were to buy a phone from another brand. Connecting a skin or handset with proprietary (online) services is another holy grail for any device maker. Apple is probably the most successful at that game, followed by Google, although Google has a small share in hardware, it does control the operating system. And that’s the key: who controls the OS is better able to control “what” is promoted along with it. The next best thing after the OS is the Android skin and preloaded apps… Large OEMs have their set of services as well. Samsung, for instance, has backups, payments, music and apps stores. 4/ Push the envelope Multi-tasking was introduced to Android via a custom Skin (here, Samsung Touchwiz in 2012) Finally, having a customized OS does allow device makers to add features originally not supported by the OS “out of the box.” Fingerprints, eye scanners and multi-window are simple examples of features that came from an OEM first, then were adopted by the Operating System later. Integrated or supplemental security layers could also be lumped in this proprietary aspect of the OS customization. Typically, large manufacturers are the ones to build, integrate and promote these first. Others who don’t have the capacity to do it are better off waiting for the OS to integrate these things. The key aspect here is innovation and time to market. 5/ Skins should not be a dramatic topic When reading reviews and forums, there are sometimes very heated debate on this topic. In reality, most skins are quite usable now, and it’s rare to see something extremely bad. It’s true that back in the early Android days, there were some Android skins that would be considered to be “fails”, but stock Android now sets the bar very high, and that motivates OEMs to go higher, or suffer the consequences. There are also sensible reasons to have some proprietary code and services if they are innovating. I personally dispute the idea of systematically changing the app icons because it brings no value at all — although technically apps are different (A Calendar app on a phone isn’t the same as another), and there are licensing issues to deal with. As a user, it’s weird. Finally, it’s possible to get rid of (some of) the cosmetic changes by installing another skin, whether it is the Google Now skin that gives a Nexus look to your interface or other good Android skins/themes available.

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Google Duo to soon support audio-only calls  By Ida Torres - August 18, 2016 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter Google just recently launched their new app called Duo, a one-to-one video calling app that you can use regardless of what platform you’re on. It seems like a pretty good app, with a fast and efficient interface which makes it fairly easy to use. But some people are of course not satisfied and are looking to have an option wherein you make audio-only calls. Well, Google has all but confirmed that his feature will be coming soon to the app. While there is no official announcement yet that Duo will actually support voice-only calls, Google’s product lead for communication, Amit Fulay, mentioned something on his Google+ page. When asked if there is any way to make an audio only call through the app, he said that is “coming soon”. That is the only question/comment he responded to (well, aside from assuring one user that Duo is now available globally, so that includes Portugal) so we assume that means something. The arrival of the Duo app for its video calls, and another Google product, Allo, for its instant messages, is just in time as Hangouts will be retooled to the needs of business users. This will leave a hole in Google’s product line, so both Duo and Allo can fill that space. That is why the addition of the audio-only calls will be a much needed feature. Of course there are no details yet as to when that would be available. But for now, if you haven’t yet, you can download Duo from the Google Play Store for free and enjoy one-to-one video conversations.

Panoramics Photos Rec.humor.funny Joke Site Robocar Bog Twitter Best of Blog Brad's Home Robocars.com Home » Topic » Robocars Uber buys Otto, folks leave Google, Ford goes big, Tesla dumps MobilEye Submitted by brad on Thu, 2016-08-18 15:18. Robocars The past period has seen some very big robocar news. Real news, not the constant “X is partnering with Y” press releases that fill the airwaves some times. Uber has made a deal to purchase Otto, a self-driving truck company I wrote about earlier founded by several friends of mine from Google. The rumoured terms of the deal as astronomical — possibly 1% of Uber’s highly valued stock (which means almost $700M) and other performance rewards. I have no other information yet on the terms, but it’s safe to say Otto was just getting started with ambitious goals and would not have sold for less than an impressive amount. For a company only 6 months old, the rumoured terms surpass even the amazing valuation stories of Cruise and Zoox. While Otto has been working on self-driving technology for trucks, any such technology can also move into cars. Uber already has an active lab in Pittsburgh, but up to now has not been involved in long haul trucking. (It does do local deliveries in some places.) There are many startups out there calling themselves the “Uber for Trucks” and Otto has revealed it was also working on shipping management platform tools, so this will strike some fear into those startups. Because of my friendship with Otto’s team, I will do more commentary when more details become public. In other Uber news, Uber has announced it will sell randomly assigned Uber rides in their self-driving vehicles in Pittsburgh. If your ride request is picked at random (and because it’s in the right place) Uber will send one of their own cars to drive you on your ride, and will make the ride free, to boot. Of course, there will be an Uber safety driver in the vehicle monitoring it and ready to take over in any problem or complex situation. So the rides are a gimmick to some extent, but if they were not free, it would be a sign of another way to get customers to pay for the cost of testing and verifying self-driving cars. The free rides, however, will probably actually cause more people to take Uber rides hoping they will win the lottery and get not simply the free ride but the self-driving ride. GM announced a similar program for Lyft — but not until next year. Ford also goes all-in, but with a later date Ford has announced it wants to commit to making unmanned capable taxi vehicles, the same thing Uber, Google, Cruise/GM, Zoox and most non-car companies want to make. For many years I have outlined the difference between the usual car company approaches, which are evolutionary and involve taking cars and improving their computers and the approaches of the non-car companies which bypass all legacy thinking (mostly around ADAS) to go directly to the final target. I call that “taking a computer and putting wheels on it.” It’s a big and bold move for Ford to switch to the other camp, and a good sign for them. They have said they will have a fleet of such vehicles as soon as 2021. Other companies have announced plans to go for unmanned capable taxi vehicles, particularly Daimler and BMW, but they still maintain active “evolutionary” projects which hope to build on their prior ADAS work. Velodyne The other big news is that Ford, together with Baidu have made a $150M investment in Velodyne. Velodyne has been for a decade the primary supplier of LIDARs for robocar research projects, but their LIDARs are research instruments, high performance at high cost. In the meantime, other companies (such as Quanergy, for whom I am an advisor) have been pushing to make better priced LIDARs for real production. The Velodynes have been the right choice, because it is smart to research with what’s expensive today, knowing it will get cheap in the future. Baidu’s test cars have had Velodynes on them, but there were recent rumours of Baidu experimenting with alternatives to LIDAR, but this investment may counter those rumours. This investment will move Velodyne more to a lower cost production unit, though at present at a higher cost than the solid-state plans of Quanergy and some others. Google Departures Otto included a few people from Google’s car team. It was also recently revealed that Chris Urmson, who had run the team for most of its existence and was moved to “CTO” after the arrival of John Krafcik, has departed. I worked for Chris but he has not told me his reason for departure. In general, Google’s car team has gotten huge, and the recently departed people are mostly folks who were among the first 20 on the team. This may simply be a sign of massive expansion, I have not heard much to credit the idea that there is some sort of internal chaos. In addition, deals like the Otto deal will certainly cause people to consider if they want to work for a big corporation or break out on their own. MobilEye A few weeks ago, MobilEye issued a press release that they would not be supplying the next generation of their EyeQ chips to Tesla. The EyeQ4 is a great deal more sophisticated than the EyeQ3 that Telsa uses, and Tesla even uses an older version with a more limited set of features — including, most famously, the inability to detect things like cross traffic. Since MobilEye announced it, it seems like it was their decision (You don’t usually issue a press release to say you have been dumped by a smaller customer.) It caused their stock to take a quick big hit (Disclaimer, I own a small amount) on the day of the announcement, but it recovered reasonably well. Tesla’s stock was not affected. Tesla folks have always claimed that they only made minimal use of ME’s functionality, and that the real special sauce was theirs. ME folks have claimed the opposite. This break-up will settle that question, and presumably Tesla has been working on alternatives for a while as they don’t seem to be in much panic about it. Tesla has made announcements of plans for their new hardware and those plans look very similar to the EyeQ4, so they must have had their own parallel research underway. » brad's blog Question Submitted by Bill D (not verified) on Thu, 2016-08-18 16:41. Brad, Any thoughts about the MIT / DARPA announcement they might be able to design lidars on a chip to be priced at around $10 each Does that seem feasible to you? Significant? http://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-talk/semiconductors/optoelectronics/mit-li... » reply Solid state Submitted by brad on Fri, 2016-08-19 00:24. This project is attempting to do a solid state LIDAR, which is also the goal of Quanergy. Quanergy is much further along, and others hope to do the same thing. The $10 price point is when you are making many millions of the chip, and yes, anything that can go on one chip in those quantities can get a cost that low, though usually you add a few other things beyond the chip. Whether it is this, or Quanergy, or other companies working on it, low cost LIDAR is definitely coming, and will be used on all robocars, I predict, even Tesla (though Elon has sworn otherwise.) Or at least it will until there is some remarkable breakthrough in computer vision. Which is not impossible, but not here yet. I expect the cheap lidars are sooner. But if you have cheap lidar and cheap camera you use both, of course, at least for the first decade. » reply Current cost of lidar Submitted by Bo Nordlin (not verified) on Fri, 2016-08-19 03:13. Brad, I highly appreciate your writing. What are the current cost of lidars in an autonomous vehicle, and what has been the typical yearly price reduction so far? » reply Current cost Submitted by brad on Sun, 2016-08-21 18:09. There is no standard LIDAR. Velodyne makes several products ranging from $8,000 to $75,000. Valeo sells a simple 4 plane designed by Ibeo for $250 but it’s not really suitable for self-driving. Quanergy has a $1,000 8 laser unit being tested by some automakers. There are a few other research ones out there. Many companies have this in development, they only just figured it out a while ago. It is reasonable to expect that suitable LIDARs will be under $250, perhaps far under, but you may need more than one. » reply Quanergy et al chip based LiDAR RANGE Submitted by Rutt Bridges (not verified) on Sun, 2016-08-21 18:59. Brad, While I have seen multiple stories about chip-based LiDAR (mostly re: Quanergy), the one thing I haven't see is a spec on range. While the cost-effectiveness of these units could be a real breakthrough for driverless vehicles, if the range is under 100 feet their application will be quite limited. Have you seen or heard any quotes on range? » reply Range Submitted by brad on Mon, 2016-08-22 03:25. Range for LIDARs is more a function of their light frequency and eye safety rules. You can’t emit so much power that it would be dangerous to the eye. At that maximum power, you can go about 100m on a dark object and still be seen coming back (against the sun.) You can go further on brighter objects, and most objects are brighter, but you have to focus on that minimum range. » reply More sensitive lidar Submitted by Anonymous (not verified) on Fri, 2016-10-28 16:33. Brad, there's an Israeli company working on more sensitive lidar sensors with a better range. » reply That is true Submitted by brad on Fri, 2016-10-28 16:40. They are in my queue to write about » reply Don't forget the poaching of Apple's talent Submitted by Mario Herger (not verified) on Thu, 2016-08-18 19:41.

Apple just bought Turi (nee Dato, nee GraphLab). In doing so they acquired the GraphLab Create and Turi Distributed platforms, nice toolkits that accelerate common Machine Learning tasks. However, those don't seem to fit with Apple's product portfolio at all. However they also acquired 50+ data scientists, most with PhDs. To me it looks like perhaps it's an acqui-hire, so they can use those resources on their internal ML projects (cough-self-driving-car-cough). Disclaimer: I'm an evangelist for Turi (i.e. a run a users' group for them, for which I get no cash compensation but do get the occasional perk like a conference ticket). However, I have no special knowledge about their business internals and this is speculation on my part. » reply Tesla & maps Submitted by Anonymous (not verified) on Sat, 2016-08-20 11:22. Hi, have you heard any news on tesla negotiating with a global mapmaker? I heard it here (webinar on high definition maps) http://ww2.frost.com/research/industry/automotive-transportation/automot... » reply Taxi model Submitted by Bejoy (not verified) on Mon, 2016-09-12 02:45. Hi Brad Given the pace at which taxi firms are trying to develop autonomous cars and autonomous car developers are increasingly foreseeing a car-on-demand model for the SDC operations, it remains to be seen how car owners/operators will prevent people from misusing the cars - Misusing meaning everything from pure vandalism and dirtying the car to outright car jacking/ using as a self-guided ballistic missile? Would you know if these firms have something in mind to prevent such incidents? » reply Rental cars Submitted by brad on Mon, 2016-09-12 11:12. Are these issues different from the issues with rental cars (Hertz) or carshare (Zipcar)? If they don’t have a wheel, you can’t use them as a missile (unless you physically alter the car, which again you can do with any rental car.) » reply You are right! Autonomous Submitted by Bejoy John (not verified) on Fri, 2016-09-16 02:45. You are right! Autonomous cars as missiles seem to be less of a threat. But when it comes to rental cars or car share, at the end of the day, the guy who takes it out has to face the owner of the car when handing it back. That leaves them kind of "obliged" to take care of the car in their custody, which is what prevents people from vandalizing the vehicle. Even a contract to take care of the car is useless if the car owner isn't around to track vandalism and take defaulters to task. Compare that to public toilets where no one is watching you use it and you don't have to face the owner(the govt., public utility cos). So people do not care so much and just use and leave it as they feel. Even facing another user doesn't seem to have the same effect as facing the owner. I see an analog in current business models of autonomous cars - nobody is watching you use it and the car just goes to the next guy who wants to use it. That made me wonder if such consumer behavior is already factored in (but maybe not announced) by autonomous car companies or is it that measures to counter such behavior need to be developed. » reply I have a number of articles on this topic Submitted by brad on Fri, 2016-09-16 10:36. Mostly related to the privacy problems because taxi owners will indeed want cameras to stop damage (mostly accidental) to cars as well as people leaving their stuff in them. My current model is as you leave (to stop the meter running) you flip the lever on the camera’s cover, it takes a photo after you are out, and compares it to the photo before you got in, and if there’s a difference, it is examined. In most cases it’s, “You left your bag in the car” but sometimes it’s “You spilled your drink or puked” and the car goes to the car wash and you get the bill. » reply Comment viewing options Flat list - collapsedFlat list - expandedThreaded list - collapsedThreaded list - expanded Date - newest firstDate - oldest first 10 comments per page30 comments per page50 comments per page70 comments per page90 comments per page150 comments per page200 comments per page250 comments per page300 comments per page Select your preferred way to display the comments and click "Save settings" to activate your changes.

By John Gruber Archive The Talk Show Projects Contact Colophon RSS Feed Twitter Sponsorship Uber to Begin Testing Self-Driving Cars in Pittsburgh Thursday, 18 August 2016 Max Chafkin, reporting for Bloomberg: Near the end of 2014, Uber co-founder and Chief Executive Officer Travis Kalanick flew to Pittsburgh on a mission: to hire dozens of the world’s experts in autonomous vehicles. The city is home to Carnegie Mellon University’s robotics department, which has produced many of the biggest names in the newly hot field. That’s a bit of a whitewashing. What happened is that Uber approached Carnegie Mellon to create a “strategic partnership”. Uber’s strategy, it turned out, was to identify CMU’s best engineers and hire them away. As I wrote at the time, their “partnership” was like that between a fox and a henhouse. The goal: to replace Uber’s more than 1 million human drivers with robot drivers — as quickly as possible. The plan seemed audacious, even reckless. And according to most analysts, true self-driving cars are years or decades away. Kalanick begs to differ. “We are going commercial,” he says in an interview with Bloomberg Businessweek. “This can’t just be about science.” Jobs that can be performed by machines eventually will be performed by machines. That’s been the steady march of progress since the dawn of the industrial revolution. But it really is extraordinary for a CEO to flatly declare that he considers the company’s workforce not to be an asset, but rather a stopgap measure he’s committed to eliminate. Say what you want about the politics of his bluntness, but he certainly deserves points for honesty. Starting later this month, Uber will allow customers in downtown Pittsburgh to summon self-driving cars from their phones, crossing an important milestone that no automotive or technology company has yet achieved. Google, widely regarded as the leader in the field, has been testing its fleet for several years, and Tesla Motors offers Autopilot, essentially a souped-up cruise control that drives the car on the highway. Earlier this week, Ford announced plans for an autonomous ride-sharing service. But none of these companies has yet brought a self-driving car-sharing service to market. Google has certainly generated a lot of publicity regarding its self-driving vehicle efforts, but I am not convinced they’re the “leader in the field”. For one thing, Google’s cars only go 25 MPH. I’ve ridden in a self-driving Mercedes S-class sedan. Not only did it travel at highway speeds, but it didn’t have any obtrusive cameras or sensors. It looked like a regular Mercedes sedan — except for the fact that it had “S 500 Intelligent Drive” painted in large letters on the side of the car. The engineers I spoke with at Mercedes were adamant that even now, while the technology is still in development and years away from production, the cars need to look beautiful. Any sensors that make the car look silly are out of the question. Perhaps Mercedes is too rooted in tradition in this regard. The first automobiles really did look like “horseless carriages”. Perhaps we’ll soon adapt to self-driving cars equipped with telltale obtrusive sensors. But right now, Mercedes has prototypes on the road that are remarkably close to full autonomy, yet don’t look any different. If Mercedes is correct that customers (or at least Mercedes customers) won’t want to buy self-driving cars that look ungainly, they have a significant leg up on competitors whose sensor arrays protrude. The technology isn’t everything — design matters. Update: If you disagree — if you think the outward appearance of a self-driving car doesn’t matter, only the comfort and amenities of the interior — I think you’re being shortsighted. If all self-driving cars are ungainly-looking, they’ll still sell. Uber is already buying ungainly-looking self-driving cars. But what happens when a company starts selling good-looking self-driving cars? Cars are status symbols — even cars you don’t own. What else explains the existence of black town cars? A lot of people used to argue that the exterior design of personal computers didn’t matter, either — only the functionality. No one argues that anymore. For now, Uber’s test cars travel with safety drivers, as common sense and the law dictate. These professionally trained engineers sit with their fingertips on the wheel, ready to take control if the car encounters an unexpected obstacle. A co-pilot, in the front passenger seat, takes notes on a laptop, and everything that happens is recorded by cameras inside and outside the car so that any glitches can be ironed out. Each car is also equipped with a tablet computer in the back seat, designed to tell riders that they’re in an autonomous car and to explain what’s happening. “The goal is to wean us off of having drivers in the car, so we don’t want the public talking to our safety drivers,” Krikorian says. On a recent weekday test drive, the safety drivers were still an essential part of the experience, as Uber’s autonomous car briefly turned un-autonomous, while crossing the Allegheny River. A chime sounded, a signal to the driver to take the wheel. A second ding a few seconds later indicated that the car was back under computer control. “Bridges are really hard,” Krikorian says. “And there are like 500 bridges in Pittsburgh.” It’s easy to roll your eyes at the use of the term “self-driving” to describe a car with two employees in the front, ready to take control at a moment’s notice. But the fact that regular people will soon be taking real-world rides where no human takes any control throughout the trip is a genuine milestone. We’re on the cusp of the biggest change to the car industry, ever. Previous: Apple and the Pistol Emoji Next: Is Donald Trump Actually Trying to Win?

Ford is testing autonomous features using Fusions. It wants to put fully autonomous vehicles on the market by 2021. For the first time in America's industrial history, the center for automotive technology is drifting away from Detroit. Ford Motor Co., aiming to put fully autonomous vehicles into the economy by 2021, announced that it's doubling the size of its office in Silicon Valley to 260 people and investing in four companies that are key to building self-driving cars. The carmaker's move follows more than $1 billion in investments made by Detroit-based General Motors Co. in a pair of California technology companies earlier this year to keep up with Google's autonomous-car project and Uber Technologies Inc.'s ride-hailing business. While the old-school mechanical engineering remains in the Midwest as does low-skilled factory work that hasn't moved to Southern states, these investments show Detroit carmakers have realized that they must go to the nation's technology center to find the software expertise needed to make the autos of tomorrow. Traditional automakers now directly employ hundreds in Silicon Valley, which is also home to Palo Alto-based Tesla Motors Inc. "The shift to California is undeniable," said Eric Noble, president of the CarLab consulting firm in Orange, Calif. "The technological development for autonomous vehicles and intelligent cars will continue to be done in northern California because that's where the knowledge is." Ford and GM, racing to stay among the technology leaders, face a few tough realities. Companies like Google and Uber threaten to upend the industry by turning car owners and drivers into passengers who simply pay for a ride. And even though the carmakers and state of Michigan are developing tech talent, Silicon Valley is still ground zero for the people who write code, create driverless algorithms and come up with new business models for mobility. California's lure Ford has invested in Velodyne Lidar Inc., which develops the laser-based sensors that are the eyes of self-driving cars, and 3-D mapping company Civil Maps, both in California. The Dearborn-based carmaker also acquired SAIPS, an Israeli-based computer vision and artificial intelligence designer, and it reached a licensing agreement with Nirenberg Neuroscience LLC. Its founder, Sheila Nirenberg, has developed a machine-vision platform that Ford said can bring humanlike intelligence to self-driving cars. "We came to Silicon Valley — there are a lot of great places around the world — but the ecosystem here is just unbelievable," Ford CEO Mark Fields, standing outside on a bright, sunny day, said to reporters. "It's like a bazaar of ideas, and everybody's open." GM CEO Mary Barra last year took her top leaders to visit tech companies and venture capital firms to get their thoughts on fostering innovation. GM went on to buy a 9 percent stake in Lyft Inc., a competitor to Uber, for $500 million. GM also spent more than that to buy San Francisco-based Cruise Automation, which writes the software for autonomous driving. Owning Cruise, which has grown from 40 employees to 100, has helped GM hire people who may not have been interested in working for an automaker, Mike Ableson, GM's vice president of global product planning, said in a June interview. Some people want to remain the California environment but also have the stability of a large company, he said. Similarly, Ford's announcement may have been intended to present the maker of F-150 pickups look like an "exciting destination for human talent," Adam Jonas, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, said in a research note. "There is at least a perception in the market that all the cool kids are going to places like Uber," Google, Tesla or China, he wrote. Ford and other automakers "want to change this." Michigan's story Michigan isn't giving up on talent, Gov. Rick Snyder said in a June interview. Snyder, a former chairman of Gateway computers and founder of investment funds, pointed out that Alphabet Inc.'s Google announced in May that it will open a self-driving car research center in Novi and that Harman International Industries Inc., the audio and automotive technology company, opened its North American headquarters nearby. Amazon.com Inc. has opened a tech center in downtown Detroit. Snyder said one of Michigan's biggest challenges is getting the word out that it has great resources for technology companies, especially in the automotive industry. With the University of Michigan focusing on software and technology development, the talent and education system is available for any company that wants to take advantage of it, he said. The university's Mcity provides carmakers and tech companies with an ersatz town to test driverless cars. Plus the state has much lower costs of living and doing business than California, especially with real estate prices rising ever faster in Silicon Valley. "Our challenge is that we don't do particularly well with telling people," Snyder said. "That's something we should do more of, especially when it comes to talking about Detroit's comeback." While the Detroit region has bounced back, its unemployment rate is 5.8 percent compared with 4.1 percent in the San Jose, Calif. area, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Snyder in June unveiled Planet M, an advertising and marketing campaign to tell technology companies that the state has the education and industrial base to be home to new automotive technology research and startups. The tagline is, "Michigan. Where big ideas in mobility are born." To compete with the Golden State, Michigan plans to make an autonomous-drive test track out of a 330-acre industrial site near Ypsilanti, where Rosie the Riveter built B-24 bombers during World War II. One selling point: Tough winters and many potholes make the site a better proxy for the imperfect world of driving than California's decommissioned Navy base in Concord. "If you look at any place in the world, we have highly developed building blocks," Snyder said.

Within weeks, the company announced Thursday, customers will be able to opt into a test program and summon an autonomous Ford Fusion. But since the technology has not been perfected, the cars will come with human backup drivers to handle any unexpected situations. Although other companies including Google are testing self-driving cars on public roads, none offers rides to regular people. As an enticement, the autonomous rides will be free, the company said. Uber employees stand by self-driving Ford Fusion hybrid cars during testing of the vehicles, Thursday, Aug. 18, 2016, in Pittsburgh. Uber said that passengers in Pittsburgh will be able to summon rides in self-driving cars with the touch of a smartphone button in the next several weeks. The high-tech ride-hailing company said that an unspecified number of autonomous Ford Fusions with human backup drivers will pick up passengers just like normal Uber vehicles. Riders will be able to opt in if they want a self-driving car, and rides will be free to those willing to do it, spokesman Matt Kallman said. (AP Photo/Jared Wickerham) Uber, which has a self-driving research lab in Pittsburgh, has no immediate plans to deploy autonomous cars in other cities. But in an interview with The Associated Press, CEO Travis Kalanick said development of the vehicles is paramount for the San Francisco company, which has grown exponentially after starting seven years ago. "We've got to be laser-focused on getting this to market, because it's not a side project for us," he said. "This is everything. This is all the marbles for Uber." Without drivers, the cost of hailing a ride will be cheaper than owning a car, changing the way we all get around, Kalanick has said. By using human backup drivers, Uber is basically testing the technology and taking people along for the ride, said Bryant Walker Smith, a University of South Carolina professor who studies self-driving technology. "Part of this is marketing in the sense that they're going to be doing continued research and development of these systems," he said. Uber also announced that it was acquiring a startup called Otto that has focused on developing self-driving big rigs and is stocked with big talent in the still-small world of self-driving technology, including Anthony Levandowski, one of the field's pioneers. Kalanick said the acquisition signals Uber's intent to get into the movement of goods and freight. In another deal, the company announced a $300 million alliance with Volvo to supply vehicles and technology. The announcements may push it ahead of its prime competitor, Lyft, which earlier this year took a $500 million investment from General Motors. Those arrangements are part of a flurry of deals between Silicon Valley tech companies, traditional automakers and ride-hailing companies as they vie for autonomous car leadership. Google has been testing self-driving cars on public roads since 2009 but has never offered large-scale rides to the public. Uber's move to haul passengers with autonomous vehicles is not surprising, given the company's history of pushing into gray areas with little or no regulation, Walker Smith said. Local laws in Pittsburgh may require a driver behind the wheel, but Pennsylvania has no laws governing autonomous cars and their role in ride-hailing, he said. He predicted that drivers will often have to intervene in Pittsburgh, with its winding, hilly roads and vast number of bridges. Each winter the city gets about 30 inches of snow, which can cover lane lines and trick autonomous car sensors that use them to help guide the ride. Use of the backup drivers is also an acknowledgement that current autonomous driving systems cannot handle the wide range of unpredictable circumstances on public roads. Timothy Carone, a Notre Dame professor who has written about the future of automation, noted that Uber is mitigating the risk with its own drivers — unlike Tesla Motors, which put semi-autonomous technology in the hands of individual customers. "This is a way to get autonomous cars out there and accepted and increase the adoption rate," Carone said. "It will take a decade of testing before an 18-year-old can get in the car and tell it where to go." Uber-branded test cars have been on Pittsburgh roads for several months. Standing at a bus stop, Anthony Fielder of the suburb of Carnegie was open to the idea. "I'd be willing to try it as long as there's a real human there to hit the brakes, you know, if the thing goes belly-up," he said. "We can only rely on technology so much or it's going to bite us." Kalanick would not speculate on when Uber might be ready to dispense with the human driver, saying that full automation can only be used now in limited places with little traffic. That's different from the relative chaos of even a small downtown, much less a big city where drivers do not always follow the rules. Carone expects Uber competitors will now accelerate self-driving tests or merger plans. He thinks they will adopt the same risk-management approach as Uber. Ford Motor Co., for example, said earlier this week that it will have a fully autonomous car with no steering wheel or pedals on the road by 2021, but it will only be used by car-sharing services and will not be sold to individuals. Though the Google car project just lost its director, Chris Urmson, it has a big head start on Uber and others. Its leaders have suggested they could launch public pilot tests of cars with no steering wheels or pedals in the next year or two. Volvo will provide Uber with SUVs for autonomous vehicle research. Eventually the SUVs will be part of the self-driving fleet in Pittsburgh. Both companies will design autonomous vehicles on their own. The real breakthrough for autonomous cars, Walker Smith said, will be when a company puts one on public roads without a backup human. For now, like a motorcycle canyon jumper with a safety net, Uber isn't ready to take the big leap. "It's probably for the best," he said. ___ Krisher reported from Detroit.
