 Before fake news exploded, here's how Google filtered out untrustworthy news sites Nathan McAlone Feb. 13, 2017, 4:47 PM 8,440 facebook linkedin twitter email print REUTERS/Erin Siegal For the small team maintaining one of the world's most popular news sites, the job was straightforward: weed out liars and scammers. But amid a sea of online information and misinformation, the Google News staffers had a sometimes tricky task. The editorial team carrying out the job was nothing like a traditional newsroom. Some members of the team had journalism bona fides, others came from the world of customer service, and still others were contractors based in India or other parts of the world. "We were a weird, motley crew," one former member of the Google News team told Business Insider. Decisions about which publications were worthy of being included on the Google News site were not always as obvious — or as transparent — as the public guidelines, several former members said. As internet companies like Google and Facebook play an increasingly prevalent role in news distribution, the editorial standards and practices of the companies are increasingly under scrutiny, especially with fake news on the rise. Business Insider spoke to a handful of former members of the Google News team to get a better understanding of how today's information gatekeepers decide which news the public sees. Google News Several described a team of full-time Google employees working out of the company's Mountain View, California, headquarters a few years ago. However, Google has changed the organization in recent years, instead relying entirely on outside contractors to vet the publishers that appear on Google News. But the main editorial inclusion guidelines, which Google created in 2011, were part of the process described by multiple Google staffers Business Insider spoke to. The system appears to be effective. Google News has suffered fewer incidents of fake news than Facebook. Still, as tech companies like Google and Facebook emerge as primary channels for news consumption, the descriptions of Google's practices highlight big changes shaping today's news industry. Long accustomed to guarding their computer algorithms and business practices in secrecy, the tech companies have adopted a similar "black-box" approach for their news services. The former Google News staffers described a system that seeks to be both fair and opaque at the same time, providing an easy-to-understand benchmark for what content is acceptable while limiting the ability of fake-news purveyors or spammers to game the system. Most surprising, multiple former staffers described a method for secretly de-ranking biased or untrustworthy publications so that a site could be kept out of prominence in Google News without the publisher knowing it was blackballed. Google denies this and says there is no way to internally identify or flag a site as biased or untrustworthy. The company declined to make a manager in charge of Google News available for an on-the-record interview but pointed Business Insider to the public guidelines that spell out how Google decides which sites to include in its news service. What is news? The Google News product, which was released in 2002, has one major difference from Google's standard web search engine: Only publications that have been reviewed and approved by Google's human staffers and special news algorithms can appear in Google News. Google says it has let over 75,000 publications from across the world onto the platform. And Google executives have said that more than 1 billion people visit the Google News site every week. Google CEO Sundar Pichai. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images Before Google outsourced the job completely to contractors, the team of editorial reviewers had all the perks of regular Google employees. The team skewed younger, but some were in their 30s and 40s. Regardless of background and specific role, they were tasked with making the same types of judgment calls about the quality of a news site. Here's how the review process currently works, according to Google: A computer algorithm performs an initial automated assessment of a site, scanning for standard signs of legitimacy, such as an "About" page. After that, a "committee" of human reviewers looks at a publisher's site, which must be endorsed by 80% of the reviewers to gain entry into Google News. The challenge of how to construct a fair Google News review system was something the team discussed from a philosophical, moral, and practical perspective, multiple staffers said. The team was "very conscientious and thoughtful," one person said. Another said, "There was a sense of responsibility." There were long discussions that ranged from philosophical questions like "What is news?" to the more practical elements of how to outwit spammers. One former staffer talked about having to decide whether the "intense rhetoric" of a site had crossed the line into "hate speech." Though the team dynamic described is from a few years ago and may have changed with the shift to outside contractors, it provides a revealing window into how reviewers thought about working within the Google News guidelines, which have remained largely the same since 2011. Don't check the facts Although the Google News gig allowed staffers to engage with thought-provoking ethical conundrums, the job was also often tedious. Some reviewed up to a few dozen sites per day and fielded questions from publishers, which was primarily a customer-service type of role. The main order of the day for reviewers was rooting out spammers and scammers. Sometimes spam was easy to spot, like when a site looked completely amateurish. Simple sites would take less than five minutes to review, one former staffer said. But it wasn't always so. One person gave an example of having to dig pretty deep to figure out that a "tech news" site was actually reselling phones. And sometimes the team would get it wrong, at least initially. One person talked about a local news site whose editor got angry after being rejected. The problem was that the publication's website was so bad it looked like spam. The site was eventually let onto the platform. Fact-checking individual articles, however, was not part of the reviewer's job. There was "no expectation of [the] full-time US team to check facts," one person said. "We wouldn't really get into the question of whether it was true," said another. Google doesn't dispute this. But Google recently introduced a limited type of fact-checking to Google News. In October, Google added a "Fact check" tag to its list that includes things like "In-depth," "Opinion," and so on. Individual articles can be tagged "Fact check," meaning they have likely been fact-checked by outside organizations, which a publisher can signal to Google News with technical markers. Google doesn't do the fact-checking itself. Google Getting blackballed Former staffers said the Google News team did not have to deal with much "fake" or "hoax" news, which seems to have emerged as a phenomenon during the 2016 US presidential campaign. "Spam" behaviors, like scraping other news sites for content and then adding a bunch of scummy affiliate links, were much more common. Still, there were cases where a publication "followed the criteria for news, but had a really clear and obvious bias," one person said. Multiple former staffers confirmed that one way to handle such cases was to let the publisher onto Google News and then manually flag the page so that it ranked lower on Google News. One said that these methods were both clear to reviewers and in their control. The "fake news" epidemic spread during the 2016 presidential election. Spencer Platt/Getty Images "You could get in and still not show up [prominently]," one person said, referring to publishers on Google News. There were some ways to "prevent users from seeing" a publication once accepted, said another. Sites that were too biased or untrustworthy could degrade the quality of Google News or even cause embarrassment if they showed up prominently, but an outright rejection of a news site could cause unwanted blowback if a publisher decided to raise a fuss in public. So staffers would quietly push some sites to the bottom. If someone searched specifically for that publication on Google News, however, it would pop up. It was still in the system, just with a lower ranking. The thinking was that if a publisher could "search for themselves" and find the site, "they will go away," one person said — no angry emails or online screeds from upset publishers or readers. Google denies that sites can be flagged by reviewers for being overly biased or untrustworthy. And the methods may have changed over time. Power users The mistrusted sites that were let onto Google News and then de-ranked were the rare bubble cases, however. More often, sites would simply be rejected for being spam. That didn't mean a rejected site would get a clear explanation from Google about what exact piece of the publication had run afoul of the rules. Google would often reject a site using "canned language" that mirrored the public guidelines, one former staffer said. There was a distance between the nuance of the internal review and the blanket statements of the external communications. Language quality was used a lot in a broad fashion, the technical Google term being "readability." The problem was that if the reviewers were too specific, publications could game the system. But though there was a certain amount of opacity in the system by design, one former staffer said reviewers always made a good-faith effort to stick to the broad mandates posted for the public when conducting the review. After being rejected from Google News, a publisher has a chance to reapply in 60 days, according to Google. Google doesn't want to leave earnest publishers completely out in the cold. To help publishers that had been rejected, one person said, Google News fostered a network of power-user volunteers to provide unofficial advice. These users hung out on the "Google News Help" forum and were often publishers of small blogs who might have had their own trouble getting past the system for one reason or another. Ultimately, the former staffers said they felt that publications that should have been included on the Google News platform were. None mentioned any cases where they felt that a site was kept off unfairly — by either the system guidelines or the judgment of another reviewer. For now, news readers and publishers will have to take their word. If you know anything more about the inner workings of Google News, tip the author at nmcalone@businessinsider.com.

News Sports Living Obits Item Banner Cars Jobs E-Edition Subscriber Services log in Site Archive On Computers: The Right Browser Sunday Feb 12, 2017 at 6:00 AM Which is the safest way to browse the web: Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome, or Mozilla Firefox? According to the blog “How to Geek,” Edge has a slight edge. Many say Firefox has the last word on privacy and we find that's it pretty private. In 2015, Firefox instituted "tracking protection." It removes all tracking elements from pages you visited using the "private browsing" feature. To use private browsing in Firefox, hold down the "Cntrl" (or "Cmd" on the Mac) and the "Shift" key. Then tap the "P” (for private) key. It was news to us that advertisers and websites can track you in Google or Microsoft's browsers even if you use the "incognito" or "InPrivate" modes. All those modes do is prevent your browsing history, cookies and cached data from being stored on your computer. You're still tracked, unless you use Firefox. We don't care if we're tracked, because it means we'll see ads targeted to our interests. Of greater concern are viruses and hackers. Microsoft and Google use what's called a “sandbox” so that each component of your browser is kept separate, making it hard for a hacker to join them together. Firefox has over 18,000 "extensions," which are apps that live in the browser. As you might expect, sandboxing all of them has been a problem. They’re still working on it. Google has over 50,000 and managed to do it. The only reason Microsoft Edge might be considered slightly safer than Google Chrome is that it keeps a better list of bad websites, making sure you steer clear of those. However, this shouldn't matter if you use anti-virus and anti-malware software. Unusual Web Browsers And now for something completely different ... There's much more out there than you can ever find time for:  “Opera Mini.” For smartphones and tablets, Opera Mini claims to save up to 90 percent of data costs; we saved 50 percent. It also blocks ads and makes multi-tasking a breeze. In our tests, it was just as fast and lovely as any browser, even when watching a movie.  "ScienceDirect," for phone, tablet or computer. Browse through the titles of 14,324,115 journal and book articles on just about any scientific research topic you can think of. Shouldn't take you more than a few decades. See anything you like? “Open access” books and articles are free, others are $35.  "Torch" is a favorite of video pirates. (Computer only.) Has a built-in feature for downloading music and video from YouTube and Vimeo. Uses Bit Torrent for rapid downloading of videos. Has lots of games. Beware the Mac App Store If you use a Macbook, you've probably noticed apps for sale in the App Store; scammers lurk there. The most benign offer to sell you something you can already get for free, such as the online version of Microsoft Word. The worst install malware on your system. Look out for apps offering Microsoft templates. Get those for free at Templates.Office.com. For other apps in the Mac App Store, look at reviews. Often, the first few are phony. Scroll past those to see what victims are saying. NOTE: This sort of thing goes back many years, in fact for all of the 36 years we've been writing this column. An easy way to get a product to sell is to find one that already exists for free and offer it for a price. We have seen this done with bundles of free programs as well as single ones. Take a look at Ninite.com for totally free programs. Speeding up Your Computer If your Windows 10 computer is running slowly, open Windows’ “Task Manager” or the “Task Manager” in your web browser. There are at least three ways to get to the Windows task manager. Bob uses “Ctrl-Alt-Del." That means holding down the “Ctrl” and “Alt” keys on your keyboard and tapping the delete key. (“Ctrl-Shift-Esc” also works.) Or, right-click the taskbar at the bottom of your screen and choose "Task manager." Each item on the list that comes up under “more details” is one of the processes or programs running in the background and almost certainly slowing you down. Joy’s computer is often running at 99 percent of its brain chip's capacity, so clicking “task manager” is an everyday thing for her. When Bob checked the brain on his PC, it was running at just three percent of capacity. (He says that fits well with his own brain activity). Recently, a “speech engine” was hogging the lion’s share of Joy's computer’s resources. Since she hadn’t been talking to Cortana (Window’s voice assistant) lately, she clicked it and chose “end task.” We also shut down "Microsoft Search Protocol Host.” But it could be that having too many tabs open in your web browser is the culprit. Rather than shutting them all down, find out which one is the resource hog. In Google Chrome, look for the three vertical dots in the upper right corner of the screen. Click “more tools,” and then “task manager.” When we did this, we noticed one website, Techlicious.com, was the real pig. So we closed that tab. Or rather, Joy did. Bob tends to be a one-tab-at-a-time kind of guy. (You can do something similar in Firefox with an add-on.) Chrome also has a “reset” button. Type chrome://settings in the search bar and when you get to settings, type “reset settings.” You can bring Chrome back to its original state. It keeps your bookmarks but gets rid of the junk that bogs you down. Internuts • MyReps.Datamade.us will tell you the names of all your political representatives, right down to the local sheriff. Next to each name is a "contact" button. There are also links to their websites, Twitter, and Facebook pages. • "Step into a Miniature World of Paper."

We got a peek at where doodles come from. Tech Culture by Richard Nieva February 12, 2017 9:00 PM PST @richardjnieva How Google made a Doodle game For Valentine's Day, Google made a game where you play a rolling pangolin looking for love. This is how a team of artists, engineers and designers made one of Google's most complex Doodles to date. by Lexy Savvides 3:40 Close Drag Think of Valentine's Day, and the first thing that comes to mind probably isn't wildlife conservation. But that's one of the themes of Google's Valentine's Day doodle, which premiered on the search giant's homepage early Monday. It's one of the most in-depth Google Doodles the company has ever created and includes an interactive video game. It took about a year to develop and involved a six-person team of animators and engineers. The doodle stars two lovestruck pangolins, scaly mammals native to Asia and Africa that look like a cross between armadillos and anteaters. Google notes in the game that pangolins are the most poached and trafficked mammals in the world. The game also includes a link to a World Wildlife Fund page, which invites people to donate to protecting them. Google's Valentine's Day Doodle took almost a year to develop. Richard Nieva/CNET "If they're endangered, they really have to meet," Helene Leroux, the head artist for the doodle, said during an interview at Google's headquarters in Mountain View, California. "So it was a perfect theme for Valentine's Day." Step foot in the Google Doodle office and you might think you're at Pixar. A large blow-up version of Baymax, the health care robot from Disney's "Big Hero 6," greets you in the hallway. Desks are lined with Star Wars and Batman toys. There are tiny drawers full of sticker versions of past doodles. And most of the desks have Cintiqs, giant tablets artists use for digital drawings. The artwork that stands in for Google's logo has also become a big deal for the company. It's pretty obvious why: For lots of people, Google's search engine is the internet. It's the first place they go online, and that makes the homepage some of the choicest real estate on the web. The first doodle, in 1998, was a glorified "out of office" message -- a Burning Man stick figure that indicated co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin were away at the annual festival. Now the Doodle team has 30 people, including animators, engineers and designers. Helene Leroux, head artist for the doodle, said the team chose its main characters from several different species that roll up into balls. John Kim/CNET But unlike animated movies and other creative projects, Google Doodles are fleeting. They go live on the homepage for a day, then are gone. (Actually, all the doodles are archived, but most people don't know that.) Doodles have also become a de facto avenue for the company to react to news. When Prince died last April, Doodlers scrambled to create a Purple Rain design in an hour to honor the singer, the fastest a doodle has ever been made. And on January 30, two days after President Donald Trump signed a controversial executive order restricting immigration from seven Muslim-majority countries, the Google Doodle celebrated the 98th birthday of Fred Korematsu, an activist who spoke out against the internment of Japanese Americans. Some saw it as a political statement. Google declined to comment on the Korematsu doodle -- or any potential political motivations -- beyond the blog post that originally accompanied the artwork. 48 Our favorite Google Doodles through the years The ecological bent in this year's Valentine's Day doodle was at first unintentional. It began as a design decision for the video game: find an animal that rolls. Runners-up included pill bugs and salamanders. The team originally settled on armadillos for the two main characters. But they wanted the game to feel more global, and worried armadillos might just invoke images of Texas and the Southwest. So the pangolin it was. The game is a side-scroller, like Super Mario brothers or Sonic the Hedgehog (in fact the game has striking similarities to Sonic, though the game's lead engineer said he's never played the Sega classic). In the game, available on iPhones, Android phones and desktop computers, you're a pangolin trying to woo your mate. You need to travel to four different countries, including Ghana and the Philippines, and collect various things to help you with your budding romance. In one level, for example, you collect flowers for a bouquet. In another, you gather music notes to write a song. They're like coins in Super Mario and rings in Sonic. So after almost a year of work, how does it feel for a doodle to finally premiere, and then vanish from the homepage a day later? "It's all this excitement, and then, nothing," said Jordan Thompson, head engineer for the doodle's video game, standing at his desk in the studio. A few feet away from him is a poster of a doodle inspired by artist Salvador Dali's painting "The Persistence of Memory," with two melting clocks standing in for the O's in Google. "It's both exciting and terrifying because you have to get it right," he added. "The first time." It's Complicated: This is dating in the age of apps. Having fun yet?

Oracle has revived its long-standing Java copyright dispute with Google, once again with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. In a massive 155-page complaint on Feb. 10, Oracle alleged that the U.S. District Court of Appeals for the Northern District of California repeatedly undermined its side of the story during a jury trial last year. The jury in that trial had concluded that Google’s Android operating system did not violate Java copyright. According to Oracle, the jury only reached that verdict because Oracle was prevented from presenting evidence at the trial showing all the markets where Android and Java overlapped. The court kept reinforcing Google’s claims that Android’s presence was limited to the smartphone market, therefore neutralizing Oracle’s central argument. In doing so, the court prevented the jury from hearing about how Android had displaced Java from markets it had once occupied, such as wearables, TVs and cars, Oracle said. Google insisted at the trial that Android is not designed for PC use and yet before the jury had even reached a verdict, the company had released Android for PCs. Despite becoming aware of the development, the district court refused to vacate the verdict, Oracle lawyers said. “Google reaped billions of dollars while leaving Oracle’s Java business in tatters,” they said. A Google spokesman declined comment on the latest development. Last week’s appeal marks the third time that the appellate court has been asked to rule in the dispute, which stems from a 2010 Oracle compliant alleging that Google had used 37 Java application programming interfaces (APIs) without licensing them from Oracle first. The database giant has claimed that Google devastated actual and potential markets for Java by copying core Java code and implementing them in Android. Oracle wants at least $1 billion in damages for copyright infringement. A company hired by Oracle to assess damages last year pegged the number as high as $9.3 billion. Google is not denying that it used Java code in developing Android. Instead, the company is maintaining that such use is permitted under fair use laws. A federal jury first heard the case in 2012, deciding that Google had indeed used the disputed APIs without permission but failed to come to an agreement on the fair use issue. The trial judge later ruled that no infringement had taken place and ruled in favor of Google. On Oracle’s appeal, the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit reversed that ruling and held that Oracle had a legitimate claim to the APIs and remanded the case back to the district court for a new trial on the fair use issue. Google, which has the support of many technology companies, tried to get the U.S. Supreme Court to review the case. Google, like many others, has held that if Oracle were to prevail in the case there would be widespread consequences for software development practices as a whole. The Supreme Court denied Google’s request after the U.S. Solicitor General sided with Oracle, noting that thousands of lines in Android had been copied verbatim from Java. Like others, the Solicitor General too held that the best way to handle the dispute was to have another trial on the fair use issue. But the jury in the second trial sided with Google as well and concluded that no copyright infringement had taken place. Oracle’s latest motion with the appellate court stems from that decision. “Oracle is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, or at least a new trial where it can fairly present its case,” the company said in its legal brief. This is the third time the appellate court has looked at aspects of the case. The first time was Oracle’s appeal of the initial trial verdict; the second time was when Google had asked it to rule on the permissibility of certain material that Oracle had wanted the jury to consider.           LATEST DEVELOPER ARTICLES   Microsoft Gets Close to Locking Down Team Foundation Server 2017 Microsoft Cognitive Services Aids Speech Recognition App Development Microsoft's .NET Strategy Rests on Community Engagement, Better Tools Visual Studio 2017 Release Candidate Gets Improved .NET Core Tooling Microsoft Acquires Simplygon 3D Virtual Reality Development Technology                 Submit a Comment Loading Comments...   Manage your Newsletters: Login   Register My Newsletters eWeek Editor's Pick News & Views Cloud Computing Mobile and Wireless Update Best of eWeek eWeek Sunday Brunch eCareers Smart Moves Enterprise Applications Topic Center Update Enterprise IT Advantage eWeek Whitepaper Spotlight eWeek Labs eWeek Enterprise Update eWeek Storage Report Industry Center Update : Finance Industry Center Update : Government Industry Center Update : Health Care Infrastructure Topic Center Update Linux & Open Source Topic Center Update Mid-Market Solutions Securing the Enterprise VoIP Topic Center Update What's Hot Now eWeekend         News and Reviews Slideshows HPE Acquires Security Analytics Vendor Niara A Look at What's Next for Ubuntu Linux in 2017 Kaspersky Discovers New Malware Designed to Stealthily Steal Data Ransomware Takes Out 70 Percent of Washington DC Security Cameras Encryption for Data at Rest comes to Azure File Storage 10 Reasons Why Apple iPad Sales Conti...

Google researchers have developed a chatbot that can carry out a natural conversation with a human, even demonstrating common sense reasoning. The system can generate solutions in an IT helpdesk scenario and even weigh in on the meaning of life – but with responses like ‘to live forever’ and ‘to find out what happens when we get to the planet earth,’ it doesn’t quite have all the answers yet. Google researchers have developed a chatbot that can carry out a natural conversation with a human, even demonstrating common sense reasoning. In one conversation, the human participant asks the machine, ‘What is the purpose of life?’ A stock image is pictured CHATBOT DISCUSSES THE PURPOSE OF LIFE  Human: what is the purpose of life ? Machine: to serve the greater good . Human: what is the purpose of living ? Machine: to live forever . Human: what is the purpose of existence ? Machine: to find out what happens when we get to the planet earth . Human: where are you now ? Machine: i ’m in the middle of nowhere. Human: what is the purpose of dying ? Machine: to have a life . Human: what is the purpose of being intelligent? Machine: to find out what it is . Human: what is the purpose of emotions ? Machine: i don ’t know .  Google’s Oriol Vinyals and Quoc V. Le reveal their ‘neural conversational model’ in a paper published to arXiv. In one conversation, the human participant asks the machine, ‘What is the purpose of life?’ To this, it responds ‘to serve the greater good.’ But, as the conversation continues, the answers become far more abstract. Asking ‘what is the purpose of living’ led it to reply, ‘to live forever.’ And, ‘what is the purpose of existence?’ prompted ‘to find out what happens when we get to the planet earth.’ It even expressed frustration at the conversation, saying ‘I’m not in the mood for a philosophical debate’ after being hounded with questions on morality and ethics that it largely struggled to answer.  While the responses may seem bizarre, the researchers say the model performed ‘surprisingly well’ across the many conversations in the study. Unlike other conversational systems, which typically rely on a set of coded rules to guide their responses, the new model teaches itself how to answer questions. According to the researchers, it is able to hold a conversation ‘by predicting the next sentence given the previous sentence or sentences’ in the dialogue.

While it’s only capable of taking on simple conversations so far, the researchers found that it can generate ‘fluent and accurate’ replies. ‘Perhaps most practically significant is the fact that the model can generalize to new questions,’ the authors wrote. GOOGLE CHATBOT ATTEMPTS CONVERSATION ON MORALITY Human: what is moral ? Machine: what empowered humanity , what intellectual the essence is . Human: what is immoral ? Machine: the fact that you have a child. Human: what is morality ? Machine: what is altruism ? Human: what is the definition of altruism ? Machine: if you don ’t believe in god , then you don ’t know . Human: ok ... so what is the definition of morality ? Machine: well , the truth is , you ’re not a believer in god almighty . Human: tell me the definition of morality , i am quite upset now ! Machine: i ’m not ashamed of being a philosopher ! Human: tell me the definition of morality . Machine: i don ’t have ethics . Human: look , i need help , i need to know more about morality ... Machine: i don ’t know what ethics is . Human: seriously , what is morality ? Machine: what is the definition of living ? Human: why living has anything to do with morality ? Machine: you ’re not a cop . Human: okay , i need to know how should i behave morally ... Machine: i don ’t know how to tell you. Human: is morality and ethics the same ? Machine: yes , sir . Human: what are the things that i do to be immoral ? Machine: i don ’t know . Human: give me some examples of moral actions ... Machine: i ’m not a moralist . Human: alright , morality ? Machine: integrity Human: what is integrity ? Machine: i ’m sorry , i don ’t know what else to say . Human: be moral ! Machine: be a man ! Human: i really like our discussion on morality and ethics ... Machine: and how i ’m not in the mood for a philosophical debate . Human: what do you like to talk about? Machine: nothing .  ‘In other words, it does not simply look up for an answer by matching the question with the existing database. ‘In fact, most of the questions presented above, except for the first conversation, do not appear in the training set.’ The system was found to answer basic IT questions with helpful solutions. When presented with ‘issues accessing vpn,’ for example, the machine asked questions about the operating systems in question and the error message to eventually come to the right answer. The chatbot uses neural networks to learn from a training set. While it’s only capable of taking on simple conversations so far, the researchers found that it can generate ‘fluent and accurate’ replies. A stock image is pictured  The researchers say this model – while it does have limitations – demonstrates the abilities of an approach that relies on data rather than rules. ‘The strength of our model is that it can be trained end-to-end and thus requires much fewer hand-crafted rules,’ the authors wrote. ‘We find that this straightforward model can generate simple conversations given a large conversational training dataset. ‘Our preliminary suggest that, despite optimizing the wrong objective function, the model is able to extract knowledge from both a domain specific dataset, and from a large, noisy, and general domain dataset of movie subtitles.’  CHATBOT GIVES SOLUTIONS IN IT-HELPDESK SCENARIO Describe your problem: i am having issues accessing vpn Machine: hi Human: hello Machine: could you please let me know what are the operating systems you are using ?

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Help two pangolins fall in love in Google Doodle’s new Valentine’s game By Ida Torres - February 13, 2017 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter If you’ve been wondering what are those two creatures featured on the Google page but have not had the time to click on it, well you’re actually standing in the way of an epic long-distance love story between two pangolins. Okay, you probably googled what a pangolin is just now, but they’re the stars of the Valentine’s Day Google Doodle for this year. Instead of the usual cupid or cute puppies, cats, or birds, Google decided to focus on what is apparently the most poached and trafficked animal in the world. But still in keeping with the love theme, they made it into a game where you help these two lovestruck pangolins, who are in a long-distance letter-writing affair, have their first date on Valentine’s Day itself. But to make sure that they do fall in love in person, you have to help one of the pangolins go around the world and learn from different countries what makes the perfect date. The first stop is in Ghana where you learn how to make chocolate cake since pangolins are apparently easily lured by good food (aren’t we all?) Then you move on to India where it’s all about music. It will learn how to make a lovely melody to serenade its partner. You’re still on a musical quest when you reach China, but this time, it’s all about dancing through collecting colorful fans. The last stop is in the Philippines where you will learn how to create the perfect bouquet to thrill the other half of this pangolin love team. The games are pretty easy to learn and master and you can share your scores on your social media, if they’re not too embarrassing. You can play them on desktop or mobile, but better hurry as Valentine’s Day is almost upon us.

CEO John Krafcik shows off a self-driving minivan at the North American International Auto Show. Photo: BRETT CARLSEN, NYT Rich compensation at Google car project fueled talent departures 1 / 1 Back to Gallery For a year, Google’s car project has been a talent sieve, thanks to leadership changes, strategy doubts, new startup dreams and rivals luring self-driving technology experts. Another force pushing people out? Money. A lot of it. Early staffers had an unusual compensation system that awarded supersize payouts based on the project’s value. By late 2015, the numbers were so big that several veteran members didn’t need the job security anymore, making them more open to other opportunities, according to people familiar with the situation. In December, the car unit morphed into a stand-alone business called Waymo, and the system was replaced with a more uniform pay structure that treats all employees the same, according to a person familiar with the situation. Still, the original program got so costly that a top executive at parent Alphabet Inc. highlighted it last year to explain a jump in expenses. A spokeswoman for Alphabet, the Mountain View company that owns Google and “Other Bets” like the autonomous car business, declined to comment. The payouts contributed to a talent exodus at a time when the company was trying to turn the project into a real business and emerging rivals were recruiting heavily. The episode highlights Alphabet’s difficult transition from a digital advertising giant into a diversified technology company with varied groups of employees requiring different incentives. Other new businesses, including health care unit Verily, use different compensation systems too, but they have yet to generate huge payouts like the car project. Most Popular 1 Concrete wall threatening to fall from SF high-rise stabilized 2 United’s 4-hour flight to nowhere 3 2,000-pound concrete slab threatening to fall from SF building The unorthodox system started in 2010, soon after Google unveiled its first self-driving vehicle. It was constructed to tie employees’ fortunes to the performance of the project, rather than Google’s advertising money machine. In addition to salaries, some staffers were given bonuses and equity in the business and these awards were set aside in a special entity. After several years, Google applied a multiplier to the value of the awards and paid some or all of it out. The multiplier was based on periodic valuations of the division, the people said. The precise metrics that the division was measured by — and caused the bonuses to balloon — are not known. But by 2015, the Google car project had come a long way: Google’s vehicles had logged more than one million autonomous miles; car companies including Toyota and Tesla announced their own plans to develop autonomous systems; and analysts predicted the technology would transform the auto industry. A large multiplier was applied to the compensation packages in late 2015, resulting in multimillion-dollar payments in some cases, according to the people familiar with the situation. One member of the team had a multiplier of 16 applied to bonuses and equity amassed over four years, one of the people said. They asked not to be identified talking about private matters. Part of the problem was that payouts snowballed after key milestones were reached, even though the ultimate goal of the project — fully autonomous vehicles provided to the public through commercial services — remained years away. It’s unclear how much the payouts cost Alphabet, however, Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat talked about it during an earnings conference call with analysts in early 2016. Operating expenses in the fourth quarter of 2015 rose 14 percent to $6.6 billion, “primarily driven by R&D expense, particularly affected by expenses resulting from project milestones in Other Bets established several years ago,” Porat said, according to a transcript. She wasn’t specific, but one of the people familiar with the situation said the comments referred to the car project compensation. Staff departures from the car division increased in 2016. Some were frustrated with the pace of progress and had doubts about new leader John Krafcik, while others wanted to start their own autonomous vehicle companies, people familiar with the matter said. The big payouts exacerbated the situation because team members had less financial incentive to stay, the people familiar with the situation said. Chris Urmson, previous leader of the project, departed in August and is working on a startup. Other early project members left to form Otto, a self-driving trucking company that was quickly snapped up by Uber. Bryan Salesky, a former Google car executive, started Argo AI, which got a $1 billion investment from Ford Motor Co. on Friday. Urmson and Salesky didn’t respond to requests for comment. Sebastian Thrun, who started the car project and helped design the pay system, didn’t respond to questions, either. During the early 2016 conference call, Porat suggested a different approach to incentives at Other Bets in the future. “It is about getting more ambitious things done. We’re doing that in a framework to ensure we are disciplined with our resources, and this was just calling out a milestone established some time ago,” she said.

Home Industry Technology Facebook tries to offer music labels a YouTube alternative Facebook tries to offer music labels a YouTube alternative A parade of up-and-coming musicians from Universal Music took the stage at the Ace Hotel in downtown Los Angeles Saturday in a pre-Grammy Awards performance for a room full of the executives who will make or break their careers. By: Bloomberg | Published: February 13, 2017 10:10 PM The world’s largest social network has redoubled its efforts to reach a broad accord with the industry, according to interviews with negotiators at labels, music publishers and trade associations. (Reuters) A parade of up-and-coming musicians from Universal Music took the stage at the Ace Hotel in downtown Los Angeles Saturday in a pre-Grammy Awards performance for a room full of the executives who will make or break their careers. Talent bookers from James Corden’s late-night show, marketing executives from top brands and executives from Spotify Ltd. and YouTube looked on. Sandwiched in between tables for Apple Inc., an imposing player in online music, and Pandora Media Inc., owner of the world’s largest online radio service, sat executives from a new act trying to break onto the scene: Facebook Inc. The world’s largest social network has redoubled its efforts to reach a broad accord with the industry, according to interviews with negotiators at labels, music publishers and trade associations. A deal would govern user-generated videos that include songs and potentially pave the way for Facebook to obtain more professional videos from the labels themselves. “We’re hopeful that they are moving towards licensing music for the entire site,” said David Israelite, president of the National Music Publishers Association, an industry trade group. Facebook’s interest in music rights is inextricably linked to its growing interest in video. Having siphoned ads away from print, online companies have recently targeted TV, which attracts about $70 billion in advertising a year. While Facebook faces competition from Twitter Inc. and Snapchat Inc., its main rival is Google, and music is one of the most popular types of videos on Google’s YouTube service. Facebook declined to make an executive available for an interview. You May Also Want To Watch: Licensing to music on Facebook would have huge ramifications for the music industry, which is fighting to grab a larger share of the money from online services. With nearly 2 billion users and a growing advertising business, Facebook could provide billions in new sales for the music industry. Beyond the revenue gains, the music industry could use a deal with Menlo Park, California-based Facebook to exert more pressure on YouTube. Music executives have long assailed what they say is YouTube’s lax approach to copyright enforcement — even though the video-sharing website is the most popular in the world for music, has catapulted many young artists to stardom and delivered $1 billion in ad revenue to the industry last year. An agreement with Facebook could also serve as a blueprint for deals with other social-media companies, like Snapchat. On the other hand, providing Facebook users with another way to get music for free could disrupt the music industry’s recent surge in sales from paid services like Spotify. The talks with Facebook are complex, involving how to prevent copyright violations in user-generated videos, so a deal could be a couple months away or more. Facebook has reassured the music industry that the company will police piracy and share ad sales. Music executives are also encouraged because Facebook in January hired Tamara Hrivnak, a well-liked former record executive who also spent time at YouTube. Video consumption on Facebook has grown to billions of views over the past couple of years, as TV networks, news organizations and users experiment with the site much like they once did with YouTube. The results have encouraged Facebook to fund original videos, though those plans are still being developed. For Facebook to obtain professional video — both music and otherwise — it may have to alleviate concerns about how clips will be presented. At the moment, most Facebook users see videos in their newsfeed, where a clip from a TV show may be followed by a baby photo and then a friend complaining about romantic frustrations. Facebook must also finish a system to police copyright-infringing material akin to Content ID, the system used by YouTube. Videos on the site already feature a lot of music for which artists don’t receive royalties — a major source of tension. Shares of the Facebook fell 0.3 percent to $133.78 at 10:45 a.m. in New York. They closed at a record $134.20 on Feb. 8. Israelite speaks for many in the music industry when he expresses doubts about the latest online giant to come knocking on the door. Music executives blame large technology companies for using music to sell services and devices without properly compensating artists. “Facebook is a very valuable company, making a lot of money, and in part because of the music on the site,” Israelite said, adding the social network is protected by the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, the same law that can shield YouTube from responsibility for pirated material. “We are looking forward to being business partners with Facebook. If that doesn’t happen, you’ll see the situation turn very quickly.” After years of declining sales, the music industry is growing again thanks to the popularity of paid streaming services from Spotify and Apple. Label executives are reluctant to give their music to another free service for fear it could slow that growth. The music industry has spent the better part of the last year fighting YouTube in the press, and trying to get laws changed so that the video-sharing service bears more responsibility for policing clips that infringe copyrights. The labels took up that fight just as they were negotiating new long-term licensing agreements with YouTube, hoping the pressure would at least result in more favorable deals. “Facebook definitely has the size and scale, but the tribal nature of music preferences is different than a feed or news stories or cute cat videos,’’ said Vickie Nauman, a music industry consultant. “To be successful, it will not only need to envision a great music experience but also have to navigate the web of label and publisher rights and relations. No small feat.’’ Please Wait while comments are loading...

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: 14th February 2017 Are you telling Google “I hate my job” every day? Maybe there is a way out… Take a cue from the two guys behind glimp. They are now doing what they love — building an awesome website and helping you save some cash. Not happy in your current role? Unfulfilled by a boring and unrewarding job? “Oh, you hate your job? Why didn’t you say so? There’s a support group for that. It’s called everybody, and they meet at the bar.”–Drew Carey, comedian We’ve all been there: That moment when you’re sitting at your desk, watching the clock take forever to tick its way towards five o’clock. Or that moment where you’re in an awful hours-long meeting where nothing had been accomplished. Or those moments when your boss gives you another mind numbing task. Well, maybe it’s time you get out of that rut. How? With some bold moves. You can’t fix your work life, or your outside-of-work life, without taking some risks. Don’t start 2017 with a soul-crushing job. Take a page from Michael and Denis, the two guys behindwww.glimp.co.nz. Here’s their story: Two years ago, glimp’s founders were in professional jobs that they found unfulfilling and unchallenging. Ample paychecks were not making life any more interesting or fun. They were at a loss of what to do with their lives. “It’s not about the money. Wasn’t necessarily about the lifestyle,” Michael said. “It was just something about continuous learning… to get my brain cranking again.” For Denis, uneventful days and an upcoming qualification that would have cost thousands to prepare for provided him with the opportunity to reassess his career path. A senior promotion couldn’t even keep him on board. “I always wanted to do something different, something else…” he said. They decided to attend Enspiral Dev Academy in Wellington, where they would get an ass-kicking crash course in coding. Over table tennis and beer-fueled talks, the two bonded over the fact that after code school, they didn’t want a job. They wanted a challenge they could be passionate about. After graduation, the two buckled down on what would eventually become glimp. Michael knew that New Zealand’s broadband market was becoming more and more competitive which in turn meant that new innovative companies would be interested in a place where they could offer their best deals. They knew that a website that saved people time, money and stress would likely be something that Kiwis would value. Michael and Denis worked harder and longer building glimp than they did when they were in previous roles. They pulled from their savings and limited their spending to rent, food and gym. (You gotta keep in shape to counteract the time sitting and coding). But it didn’t faze them one bit. Their hard work helped glimp go live in January 2016. One year later, the guys are working even harder to bring the best deals on broadband, power and credit cards to you. Now, they’re just doing it from a villa in Bali! “There’s no concept of ‘I want my old lifestyle back’ because this is sweet,” Michael said. “Way more exciting and even to this day, I don’t consider it as work. It’s fun. I would do this for free.” Is kicking the status quo hard? Of course! But here is food for thought as Michael and Denis did the following to engineer the lifestyle they wanted. • Denis relocated to Wellington full time to study at Dev Academy and then start glimp straight after graduation. • Denis also sold his prized possession – his motorbike! • Michael sold everything that wasn’t bolted to the floor (even his bed!) to give him the means to work full-time on glimp and not bring in a salary. • Both guys lived off $250 per week (including rent)! They couldn’t even afford their daily caffeine hit! • They sacrificed time with friends and family in the short term to put the amount of time and effort they knew was required to get glimp off the ground and bringing in revenue • They hustled hard: When they didn’t know who to contact at certain internet providers to pitch their idea, they rocked up to head offices, knocked on the door and asked who they should be speaking to. • Persistence was key when trying to get in touch with the right people. • When they received knock backs from certain Internet providers, this did not set them back. They backed themselves and went after the next company. It may have been hard to scale back on so much, but the two guys are much happier having time to work on the projects they love! “To be completely honest, all these quotes you heard from Steve Jobs and the like about how it’s not about money, but time is the most precious thing we have — I used to think they did not live in the real world with views like that,” said Michael. “But being on the flip side and selling all my stuff, living on hardly any money but working on something I truly cared about brought me to the realisation that they are bang on. Close out the noise from those around you and make the decision for you.” If you’d like to know more about the guys or have questions about ideas, then flick them an email and they’ll be more than happy to help!

According to a new report out of Bloomberg, early staffers were paid in an unusual way that later severely inflated compensation and led to exodus of early staff… The problems of “leadership changes, strategy doubts, and new startup dreams,” as Bloomberg notes, have already caused Waymo employees to be a bit less sticky than average, but this little detail doesn’t seem to have helped. According to the report, inflated compensation caused early staffers to no longer need job security around the same time that competitors were beginning to recruit much more heavily. At least two people referred to this as “F-you money”: Early staffers had an unusual compensation system that awarded supersized payouts based on the project’s value. By late 2015, the numbers were so big that several veteran members didn’t need the job security anymore, making them more open to other opportunities, according to people familiar with the situation. Two people called it “F-you money. The system sounds good in theory, since is detached the compensation of self-driving car staff from the Mountain View company’s traditional advertising business. It was constructed to tie employees’ fortunes to the performance of the project, rather than Google’s advertising money machine. In addition to cash salaries, some staffers were given bonuses and equity in the business and these awards were set aside in a special entity. After several years, Google applied a multiplier to the value of the awards and paid some or all of it out. But apparently, it didn’t really work too well in Google’s favor. As you may or may not recall, Google’s self-driving car program lost its key long-time CTO and director Chris Urmson and two other early members of the project in August of 2016. Urmson went on to start his own self-driving company and brought some members of the self-driving car team with him. While this was definitely a problem as Google tried to transition its self-driving unit into a standalone business, Bloomberg notes that the pay system was completely overhauled around the same time that Google’s self-driving unit was spun out as Waymo, a standalone company under Alphabet. In December, the car unit morphed into a standalone business called Waymo, and the system was replaced with a more uniform pay structure that treats all employees the same, according to a person familiar with the situation Guides Self-Driving Car View THe Guide Alphabet View THe Guide Waymo View THe Guide blog comments powered by Disqus Submit a Tip cancel Submitting a tip constitutes permission to publish and syndicate.

Twitter Facebook Google crams machine learning into smartwatches in AI push Google researchers are lowering the bar on hardware needed to perform artificial intelligence tasks Agam Shah (IDG News Service) 14 February, 2017 06:56 - - - - print email Comments Google is bringing artificial intelligence to a whole new set of devices, including Android Wear 2.0 smartwatches and the Raspberry Pi board, later this year. A cool thing is these devices don't require a set of powerful CPUs and GPUs to carry out machine learning tasks. Google researchers are instead trying to lighten the hardware load to carry out basic AI tasks, as exhibited by last week's release of Android Wear 2.0 operating system for wearables. Google has added some basic AI features to smartwatches with Android Wear 2.0, and those features can work within the limited memory and CPU constraints of wearables. Android Wear 2.0 has a "smart reply" feature, which provides basic responses to conversations. It works much like how predictive dictionaries work, but it can auto-reply to messages based on the context of the conversation. Google uses a new way to analyze data on the fly without bogging down a smartwatch. In conventional machine-learning models, a lot of data needs to be classified and labeled to provide accurate answers. Instead, Android Wear 2.0 uses a "semi-supervised" learning technique to provide approximate answers. "We're quite surprised and excited about how well it works even on Android wearable devices with very limited computation and memory resources," Sujith Ravi, staff research scientist at Google said in a blog entry. For example, the skimmed down machine-learning model can classify a few words -- based on sentiment and other clues -- and create an answer. The machine-learning model introduces a streaming algorithm to process data, and it provides trained responses that also factor in previous interactions, word relationships, and vector analysis. The process is faster because the data is analyzed and compared based on bit arrays, or in the form of 1s and 0s. That helps analyze data on the fly, which tremendously reduces the memory footprint. It doesn't go through the conventional process of referring to rich vocabulary models, which require a lot of hardware. The AI feature is not intended for sophisticated answers or analysis of a large set of complex words. The feature can be used with third-party message apps, the researchers noted. It is loosely based on the same smart-reply technology in Google's messaging Allo app, which is built from the company's Expander set of semi-supervised learning tools. The Android Wear team originally reached out to Google's researchers and expressed an interested in implementing the "smart reply" technology directly in smart devices, Ravi said. AI is becoming pervasive in smartphones, PCs, and electronics like Amazon's Echo Dot, but it largely relies on machine learning taking place in the cloud. Machine-learning models in the cloud are trained, a process called learning, to recognize images or speech. Conventional machine learning relies on algorithms, superfast hardware, and a huge amount of data for more accurate answers. Google's technology is different than Qualcomm's rough implementation of machine learning in mobile devices, which hooks up algorithms with digital signal processors (DSPs) for image recognition or natural language processing. Qualcomm has tuned DSPs in its upcoming Snapdragon 835 to process speech or images at higher speeds, so AI tasks are carried out faster. Google has an ambitious plan to apply machine learning through its entire business. The Google Assistant -- which is also in Android Wear 2.0 -- is a visible AI across smartphones, TVs, and other consumer devices. The search company has TensorFlow, an open-source machine-learning framework, and has its own inferencing chip called Tensor Processing Unit.

Google has teamed up with Ivyrevel, H&M’s digital fashion house, to create this exact concept through a project called Coded Couture. By using an Android App to monitor activity you can build a hyper-personalized digitally tailored dress that can then be bought within the app. The idea behind Coded Couture is to create the ultimate in personalization when it comes to fashion. The “coded-dress” is created with the routes you take and the routines you have, translating them physically into lines on a map that are then incorporated into the pattern of the dress. You are also able to choose the style of the dress that you’d like such as work, party or formal. The app to create the dress is currently in beta and is being tested by a number of style “influencers” including the co-founder of Iveyrevel, Kenza Zouiten. If you’re interested in being a tester, you can sign up here. How people are engaging with fashion brands is ever-evolving. In the past, people looked to fashion designers to tell them what to wear, and while this idea is not completely dated, consumers are increasingly dictating what they want to fashion companies. Fashion companies are becoming more focused on meeting customers where they are instead of providing an aspirational lifestyle that they hope attracts their target audience. For example, fashion brand Fendi recently launched a digital platform that invited people to share content in interesting new ways. The idea behind the platform was to make Fendi’s voice open and relatable, allowing fans to engage with the brand, rather than closed off behind a silo, which is how fashion operated for decades.

By Jose Vilches on Feb 13, 2017, 2:45 PM TechSpot Google is rolling out a new feature in Android 7.1.1 — aka Nougat — that will make it easier to share a cellular data connection with other Android devices you own. Dubbed Instant Tethering, the feature is only available across Pixel and Nexus devices, and essentially makes it so that you can share one device's cellular connection automatically with another supported device signed into the same Google account. There’s no need for passwords or manually setting up hotspot sharing. Google’s Omri Amarilio explains: “When you unlock a tablet such as the Pixel C, it will notice if there is no internet connection available, and will ask your Pixel phone if it has internet and battery life. If it does, we will give you an option to enable a secure hotspot and pair automagically, without even taking your phone out of your pocket.” According to Amarilio, the feature will also detect whether you’ve stop using the linked device for over 10 minutes and shut down the Instant Tethering link to preserve battery life. The list of supported devices includes the Pixel, Pixel XL, Nexus 6, Nexus 5X, Nexus 6P, Pixel C, and Nexus 9. In order to switch on the feature, users need to head to Settings > Google > Instant Tethering and tap on 'Provide data connection' option to make their data connection available to other supported devices. It’s unclear if Instant Tethering will eventually roll out to devices other than Nexus and Pixel or it will stay exclusive to them. As it is now it's not a feature that'll be immediately useful to most people.

Yet Chromebooks have defied expectations and made major inroads in an unexpected environment – U.S. schools. In retrospect, that shouldn’t be too surprising. Chromebooks are cheap and easy to manage, making them popular with budget-constrained schools with limited tech-support staff. And wi-fi is now common enough in U.S. schools and homes to make an internet-dependent device practical for students. Google doesn’t want to stop there. It’s releasing new models in partnership with Samsung that are designed to appeal to a broader range of consumers. They have several tablet-like features, including a stylus, touch controls and a 360-degree hinge that allows you to turn the screen faceup. One starts selling Sunday for $449; a more powerful version comes out in April for $100 more. Google and its manufacturing partners are trying to shed the perception of Chromebook as underperforming budget devices. But even with premium models, expanding beyond U.S. schools won’t be easy. CHROMEBOOKS GET SCHOOLED For personal computers and tablets, Chromebook’s share of the U.S. education market was 49 percent last year, up from 40 percent in 2015 and 9 percent in 2013, according to IDC figures released this week. But education accounts for just 14 percent of the 110 million devices shipped in the U.S. last year – and Chromebooks make up just 9 percent of that broader total. Their numbers are also low abroad, even in schools. The Chromebook’s popularity in U.S. education is also largely limited to grades K-12, analysts say. Macs and Windows laptops are still dominant on college campuses. ROUGH START Chromebooks use a lightweight operating system designed to get people online faster, without having to wait around for the computer to start up. Much of the heavy lifting on Chromebooks gets done on Google’s remote servers, so Chromebooks themselves don’t need fast chips or lots of storage. Early on, though, that made Chromebooks seem cheap and underpowered, which “soured consumer expectations right off the bat,” IDC analyst Linn Huang said. Online storage for photos and documents online were much less common in 2011 when Chromebooks launched, so their limited local storage was initially unappealing. And the few apps available for Chromebooks didn’t work offline, at least at the time. DIFFERING NEEDS But what constrains consumers can actually be liberating in education. Most kids don’t need laptops on the bus or other locations where they can’t connect to wi-fi. And they don’t miss business software like Microsoft Office; Google’s online apps for documents and spreadsheets do just fine for homework. “What surprised us was how quickly it took off in education,” said Kan Liu, who oversees Chromebooks at Google. Apple’s iPad was hot at the time, but Google sold the Chromebook on convenience. They’re easier for classrooms to share; just sign in with a Google account, and a student’s apps and documents instantly appear. Teachers also have online tools to lock down what apps and sites students can use. And with models available for less than $200, schools can get a few Chromebooks for the price of an iPad or a rival laptop. “It allows us to put more devices in students’ hands,” said Aaron Slutsky, chief technology officer for McDowell County Schools in North Carolina. FAR FROM UNIVERSAL But Chromebook’s success story in schools is largely an American one, and it’s likely to stay that way. Gartner analyst Mikako Kitagawa notes that Chromebooks are useless in China because the device depends on Google services that aren’t available there. And in emerging countries, where a budget laptop would be ideal, she said internet access isn’t reliable enough. Even in the U.S., the iPad is better for many creative tasks such as recording and editing movies. Students studying engineering, robotics and graphics won’t be able to use Chromebooks to run the kind of specialized software that’s available for Macs and Windows laptops. “But that’s not needed for 98 percent of our students,” said Tracy Dabbs, coordinator of technology and innovation at the Burlington-Edison School District near Seattle. Many school districts limit Apple and Windows computers for the students who specifically need them, then provide Chromebooks for the rest. McDowell County, for instance, has 5,500 Chromebooks, 1,200 iPads – and only 100 Macs and 200 Windows PCs. RIVALS STAGE A COMEBACK Last year, Apple gave iPads in schools some Chromebook-like features unavailable to the general public. That includes ways to let multiple people use a single tablet and management tools for tech-support staff. A new Classroom app lets teachers control what apps students run and track their progress. Apple also provides classroom tools for teachers and students. Free e-books offer teachers step-by-step guides on using iPad apps and curriculum suggestions for everyday subjects. A separate app lets kids learn programming using the same language developers use to build iPad apps. Meanwhile, Microsoft announced last month new online apps and management tools for schools, along with Windows PCs priced similarly to Chromebooks. BEYOND SCHOOLS Huang said some businesses are giving Chromebooks a second look, especially in retail, banking and other settings where people share computers. But in many offices, the lack of business software such as Office is a major hurdle. Google’s alternative lacks many advanced capabilities found in Office, and habits are hard to change. Google is trying to make Chromebooks more palatable by letting them run Android apps designed for phones and tablets. It’s testing this capability on a handful of Chromebook models, including the new ones from Samsung. That makes it possible to install Office, Adobe Photoshop and many apps on a Chromebook, though these tablet versions have limited features compared with versions for Macs or Windows laptops.

Steve Dent, @stevetdent 02.13.17 in Internet Comments 465 Shares Share Tweet Share Save You can now create Spotify-like "playlists" of your favorite local spots on Google Maps that your friends can share and follow. The feature, which Google recently rolled out to Local Guide users, lets you create "Favorites," "Starred Places," "Want to Go" and your own custom lists. The idea is to "start flexing your local knowledge muscles," Google said, and benefit from the inside info of other folks by following their lists. The feature is very similar to those on Foursquare, right down to the nearly identical icons, showing that Facebook isn't the only company willing to copy a smaller competitor. Once it rolls out to your area (I don't have it in France yet and I'm a Local Guide), you just find a restaurant or other place in Maps and hit the "save" icon. That'll let you add it to one of the above lists or a new one you create like "Favorite Pho Spots" or "Best Veggie Burgers." From there, you can share the lists via social media, texts or email, and follow lists from friends and family yourself. You can even follow (or be followed by) strangers, provided you set the lists to "public." As with Spotify, the right lists can give you a speed-dial-like network of places if you're trying to figure out where to dine or visit on short notice. The feature is available on iOS, Android, even offline, and should be rolling out now. You can search for lists on the web, but won't be able to make lists there until a later update. As mentioned, you may have to wait a bit for it to come to your area.

Google Maps lets you save and share favorite places with launch of Lists Posted Feb 13, 2017 by Sarah Perez (@sarahintampa) 0 SHARES Next Story Revel co-founder’s new startup aims to build a web of authentic identities Google Maps is today rolling out a new feature to all users on iOS and Android devices that will allow you to make lists of places that you can star, save and share with friends. There are three different lists types built in at launch – “Favorites,” “Starred Places,” and “Want to Go” – the latter which is designed to serve as a personal bucket list. However, you can also create your own custom lists which can be public, private, or shared with a link. The feature has been in testing since this past fall among Google’s power users, Google Local Guides, and was built off the starring functionality that’s been available in Google Maps for over five years. Being able to create and share lists of places could give Google Maps a more social feel to it. That’s an area that Google wants to explore, notes Maps lead product manager, Zach Maier. Before, he says, Maps has been focused on getting people from point A to point B without getting lost. Now, “we want to help people break out of their routine, and do something new,” he explains. To use the lists option, you tap the “Save” button that appears on the detail page for the location in question, whether that’s a business – like a restaurant, bar, or shop – or anything else. It can even be a drop pin you place on the map itself, Maier said. That’s helpful for marking specific destinations that aren’t otherwise discoverable in Google Maps, like a particular spot within a large, local park. It seems like Starred places and Favorites could have some overlap, but the intention with Stars is to allow users to save a personal list of places they need to reference, that aren’t necessarily those they would call “Favorites.” For example, a doctor’s office or school might be Starred, but not favorited. During testing, users could create lists for themselves, but with today’s launch these can be shared and followed, too. So if you make a list of the best restaurants in your city, you can make it discoverable by any user on Google Maps by setting the list to public. Or, if you’re making a list to be shared with just one person or a group of friends – like a travel itinerary or local recommendations catering to someone’s particular interests – that list can be shared via a link instead. Clicking the link will display the list, and with another click you can choose to follow it as well. This will allow you to pull up the list and keep track of its updates at any time, as long as you’re logged into your Google account. Google hasn’t partnered with any brands or publishers on the launch to seed the service with interesting and useful public lists, but Maier didn’t rule out the possibility in the future. Today, Google already works with several companies, like NYT, USA Today, Michelin, and Google-owned Zagat, for instance, to augment its search results with more information, including links to those brands’ own lists. It would make sense to bring them to Google Maps at some point, too. The new feature will compete head-on with Foursquare, which has offered list-making tools for some time, as well as with smaller startups like Soon, Spot, and the zillions of other “bucket list” making tools on the App Store. Google’s public lists won’t yet be searchable, in the same way that Foursquare’s are, but your own lists will pop up as suggestions when you begin to type in the search box. Your lists and those you follow are also available offline. Google says the new feature is rolling out today on iOS and Android, and lists will be viewable on the web through shared links. The full list-making experience will come to the web and other platforms at a later point. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase Google Founded 1998 Overview Google is a multinational corporation that is specialized in internet-related services and products.

Homepage TILT Follow Sign in / Sign up Home Interviews Articles Back Issues Jessamyn WestBlockedUnblockFollowFollowing Rural tech geek. Proud member of the librarian resistance. Collector of mosses. Enjoyer of postcards. ✉️ box 345 05060 ✉️ Apr 20, 2015 Kind of a Big Deal What it’s like to be a famous librarian I am the nerds, the girl, the underwear. I didn’t choose the librarian life, the librarian life chose me. “Who is the most famous person in your profession?” We had this conversation over dinner last week. Everyone named a name that the others had never heard of. The most famous electrical engineer. The most famous physical therapist. The most famous prisoner’s rights lawyer. And I realized that, for some values of famous, the most famous librarian is me. My name usually shows up on lists of famous librarians. You Google “famous librarian” and you see a picture of me. No I am not joking. Their definition of librarian may be a little loose. Sometimes you Google “famous librarian” and there I am. The list of famous librarians is not that long and it’s often made up of people who have done things with books generally and may or may not have spent the bulk of their lives working in or around libraries. The people that Google thinks of as librarians mostly had other jobs. When the short list of famous people in your profession includes Eratosthenes, you learn that librarianship is not a platform that supports what most people would think of as celebrity. I don’t get recognized when I go into random libraries (usually) and my name is not a library household word. However I have gotten to go on some great “behind the scenes” library tours and seen some awesome library basements. You can spend your fame in different ways and that’s where mine goes. Being on the internet since forever, owning the librarian.net domain, and replying to email when lazy-googling reporters contact me all work together as a pyramid scheme of increasing findability in a world where findability = fame. I did a few high profile things on the early web (USA PATRIOT Act warrant canary signs, blogging at the 2004 Democratic National Convention). That helped. When you Google “librarian” I’m the first result that has a single human at the other end. And I answer the phone. King of the Dipshits I grew up in the era of movies like Sixteen Candles. Nerds on the screen were characters like Anthony Michael Hall’s Farmer Ted who wanted nothing more than to show his geek friends a pair of girl’s underwear in order to maintain his status as somewhat higher-functioning than they were. His self-proclaimed title, king of the dipshits, is one he wears with honor. The only memorable female nerd in this movie was Joan Cusack, awkwardly trapped in a neckbrace. The jockeying for status among the nerds was what stuck with me. They’re on the bottom of the social pecking order at school, but among themselves everyone’s got their role to play. The world of nerds hasn’t changed that much, but their job opportunities have expanded dramatically. Librarianship is a classic nerd profession and I mean that in the best way possible. As a middle-aged female nerd, when I say king of the dipshits, I say it with love and pride. Staying vs. Roaming Part of being well-known is just meeting people. Librarianship is a distributed profession that maps the population. There’s not really a concentrated core of librarians in any one location besides “online.” If you want to know librarians personally, and want them to know you, you travel. Which gets tricky because most people who actually work full-time in libraries get few opportunities to travel for their jobs outside of the occasional state or national conference. And yet, they are the ones doing the good works that people like me only talk about. If you can travel, people get to know you and you get to know them. And if you’ve got the time, there are lots of places to go. There’s a national conference annually and then each state has their own association which also has an annual conference. Then there are different subgroups such as law librarians, music librarians, public librarians, Christian librarians, progressive librarians and these groups all have their own conferences that need attendees and speakers… I’ve held part-time jobs doing technology instruction, answering email, writing for library publications, running websites, and doing public speaking at library conferences which means I get to high five librarians all over the country. They meet me but most importantly: I meet them. Knowing the things that matter to librarians all over the country also makes me feel like I’m doing our work when I use my mini-fame to help forward the concerns of our profession to the people outside of it. What does a famous librarian do? Graduate (mentor) Having people entering the profession thinking it’s fun and creative and interesting is so much better than people thinking it’s a clean indoor job where you can read all day. The bumper crop of new librarians is so much snazzier and savvier than when I was in library school. Let’s keep it up. Get good people into the profession and keep them there. Collaborate Fight the perpetual image problem from the inside. Work on morale at the same time as you work on messaging. Promote good works by your colleagues and say “Nice going” as often as possible. People make fun of how you dress? Ignore them and rock that cardigan. Rock it. Translate I am good with technology and speaking to tech people. I am good with understanding what a library needs in its technological environment. I often translate one group’s needs and concerns to the other, and back again and suggest ways these communications can go more clearly in the future. Innovate We’ve got a license to share and it’s a marvelously fertile time for using technology to do just that. Figuring out what technology adapts well to library purposes (for use within the library or connecting librarians outside the library) and being an early adopter and telling stories of how other libraries are using technology well. Agitate I frequently remind people that serving the entire public is actually challenging and complex and that libraries do a pretty good job at it even in the face of an increasingly privatized world. Copyright reform, fair use, intellectual freedom and the Library Bill of Rights remain important foundations of our profession. Tell people. Advocate For diversity and inclusion. Our profession should reflect the diversity of our patrons. Access to content and services should be as equitable as we can make it, for all the people, especially the most difficult to serve. The empowerment divide is real. Libraries and their supporters often speak for the people who can’t or don’t speak for themselves. These are not really what you would think of as famous-person activities. There’s very little autograph signing. I rarely appear in fancy outfits or have my photo taken in public. Ultimately I’m just one part of a really large interconnected system of people and technology that runs the libraries in this country. And our people are only as famous as they need to be to get that job done. ♫ “We found them and they found us and now they are ours.

The perfect marriage, for some. CNET Wearable Tech by Jason Cipriani February 13, 2017 12:09 PM PST @MrCippy Google's Android Wear 2.0 is here, starting with LG Watch Style and Sport Updated watch software transforms Google's Android Wear, and LG's newest smartwatches let us try it out. by Scott Stein 2:37 Close Drag Android Wear 2.0 recently launched, adding new features and a revamped interface to Google's smartwatch platform. The idea of using an Android Wear watch with an iPhone is admittedly, well, odd. However, with Pebble no longer around, the Android Wear lineup is a worthy alternative to the Apple Watch. Here's what you need to know about using Android Wear 2.0 with your iPhone. Requirements Enlarge Image Screenshot by Jason Cipriani/CNET In order to use an Android Wear watch with your iPhone you'll need to have an iPhone 5 or newer with iOS 9 and above installed. A quick way to check if your phone will work is to visit g.co/WearCheck on your phone. Add your Google account Enlarge Image Screenshot by Jason Cipriani/CNET With Wear 2.0, Google treats the watch as a standalone device, and with the addition of the Play Store (more on that in a minute), you will need to add your account to the watch to get the most out of it. After updating your Android Wear watch to Google's latest and greatest, or during initial setup of a new watch, you'll notice you're now asked to add your Google account to your smartwatch. Follow the prompts in the Android Wear for iOS app to add your account(s) to your watch. Google Assistant, at your service Jason Cipriani/CNET With Android Wear 2.0, this is the first time iPhone owners get to experience Google Assistant. To use Assistant, long-press the power button on your watch. As with Siri, Assistant listens and takes commands such as "Start a timer." Alternatively, you can ask questions, get directions or start a workout with Google Fit through Assistant. In the Settings section of the Android Wear app there's an Assistant listing, however, tapping on it does absolutely nothing. Based on the same settings in the Android version of the app, you should have a series of options to set up smart home devices you can control with Assistant. Hopefully Google releases an update to this issue. Get apps With Android Wear 2.0, you can install apps directly on a watch, instead of relying on a paired smartphone to install an app or service. That means the Play Store is built directly into the watch, where you can search and browse through Android Wear 2.0 apps and watch faces. There isn't a method to browse the Play Store on your iOS device, however you can browse the Play Store on your computer, then remotely install apps on your Android Wear 2.0 watch after clicking on Install. In order to install apps on your watch, you'll need to have it connected to Wi-Fi. Connect to Wi-fi Instead of letting your watch rely on the Bluetooth connection to your iPhone -- which can run into issues whenever iOS kills apps to free up memory -- make sure to connect your Android Wear watch to your Wi-Fi network. Doing so allows will let your watch continue to work without your iPhone nearby, continuing to receive things like Gmail notifications until you can relaunch the app on your phone. To connect a watch equipped with Wi-Fi capabilities to your network, open Settings > Connectivity > Wi-Fi > Add network. Select the network you want to connect to, then use your phone to enter the password when prompted. No Android Pay -- yet Google had originally hinted that Android Wear 2.0 would bring its mobile payment platform, Android Pay, to iOS devices. Unfortunately, it wasn't quite ready for launch. Google has told me they are hard at work on making Android Pay available on iOS, and will release it as soon as possible. Dealing with notifications Enlarge Image Screenshot by Jason Cipriani/CNET Notifications are a big draw for smartwatch buyers, and in order to provide the best experience given Apple's limitations on iOS, Google has tweaked how some apps work. Specifically, you will find that Gmail notifications are done independently of any email app you have installed on your iPhone. Instead, your watch checks email on its own and uses a built in Gmail app to display and interact with new messages. In turn, notifications from Apple's Mail app are blocked from showing up on your wrist by default. You can block specific apps, or disable Gmail's rich notification functionality in the Android Wear app under the Settings icon. If an app isn't blocked but you aren't receiving notifications on your watch, open your iPhone's Settings app, then select Notifications. Open the Notification setting for the app you're having trouble with, then make sure Show in Notification Center is turned on. Somewhat limited The overall experience when using an Android Wear watch with your iPhone is a bit limited when you compare the experience to an Android phone. That said, there's still a lot of overlap in functionality. We recently covered the best tips to get the most out of the latest OS for your Android Watch here. Make sure to read through for tips on navigating and quickly changing watch faces on your watch. It's Complicated: This is dating in the age of apps. Having fun yet? These stories get to the heart of the matter. Tech Culture: From film and television to social media and games, here's your place for the lighter side of tech.

He became interested in the UFO after noticing it was 'too slow to be a satellite'.  Scroll down for video  Amateur astronomer Luis Verdiales, from Puerto Rico, spotted the 'small black disc' flying across the face of the moon during Friday's rare celestial event when the planets aligned together - and aviation experts managed to work out it was one of Google's balloons. A penumbral eclipse occurs when the Sun, Earth and Moon all align almost one-behind-another.  The rare event, which happens up to nine times per century, casts a faint shadow over the moon from its top.   'I was using a 125mm telescope to capture the eclipse when the small black disk appeared,' said Luis G. Verdiales from Loiza, Puerto Rico, according to The Sun. 'It was moving too slow to be a satellite, so slow that I was able to capture it with my camera four times.

He also discovered that the balloon was crossing between Mr Verdiales' back garden and the moon at the time of the lunar event. 'It got my attention because it was round.' Mr Verdiales showed his photographs to the Sociedad de Astronomía del Caribe (SAC), the Carribean’s largest astronomy society. Experts from the society consulted flight maps and discovered that the mysterious spherical object was actually one of Google's Project Loon balloons.  A view of the Moon during a penumbral lunar eclipse as birds fly in the sky over the island of Petatan, in the municipality of Cojumatan, Michoacan State, Mexico on Friday The mysterious spherical object was identified as one of the Google Project Loon's balloons, pictured here at the Airforce Museum in Christchurch Google has sent thousands of balloons into the atmosphere to see whether they can help disconnect areas get access to the internet.   SAC expert Eddie Irizarry discovered that the project's HBAL176 balloon was flying 61,400 feet (18715 metres) high just east of Puerto Rico. He also discovered that the balloon was crossing between Mr Verdiales' back garden and the moon at the time of the lunar event.  The next eclipse will take place on February 26, when the moon with pass in front of the sun creating a small halo of light.  What is a penumbral lunar eclipse? A penumbral lunar eclipse occurs when the Sun, Earth, and Moon align in an almost straight line When this happens, the Earth blocks some of the Sun's light from directly reaching the Moon's surface, and covers a part of the Moon with the outer part of its shadow, also known as the penumbra This kind of eclipse happens between 0 and 9 times per century on average. The last one took place on March 14, 2006. The next is due in August 29, 2059 A total lunar eclipse of the moon happens when the inner part of Earth’s shadow, called the umbra, falls on the moon’s face.

(AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez) Share Written by Keith Collins February 11, 2017 Oracle filed yet another appeal yesterday (Feb.10) in its never-ending lawsuit accusing Google of stealing its code. Here’s a short recap of what got us to this point: 2010: Oracle sued Google, claiming the search giant infringed its intellectual property (Java’s open-source API code) for use in the Android operating system. 2012: In a victory for Google, the US district court in San Francisco ruled that the code was not subject to copyright law, and thus Oracle had no case. 2014: A federal appeals court reversed the 2012 ruling. This win for Oracle made the code in question subject to copyright law, as well as all similar software that’s written to interface with a programming language or application. 2016: A jury at the same US district court in San Francisco, which ruled in Google’s favor in 2012, found that although the Java API code was now subject to copyright, Google’s use of it did not constitute infringement. Oracle was denied the $9 billion it was seeking. Now: Oracle is back at it again with another appeal. “When a plagiarist takes the most recognizable portions of a novel and adapts them into a film, the plagiarist commits the ‘classic’ unfair use,” attorney’s for Oracle wrote in its new brief. “No court would accept the defense, ‘I added other content and creativity to make the story work as a movie’ or ‘I transformed the story by adapting it to a different medium.'” “Google reaped billions of dollars while leaving Oracle’s Java business in tatters,” the brief says. The big question in this case has always been whether Google’s use of the code could be considered “fair use.” In copyright law, fair use means that the way in which the copyrighted work was used had no substantial negative impact on the copyright holder. There are four criteria courts use to establish whether something is fair use, but this case has largely revolved around one in particular: whether Google’s use of the code had a negative effect on the market for Oracle’s Java API. One jury has already decided that it did not, and another one believed the question itself was moot. Now, nearly seven years after filing its original suit, Oracle appears undeterred and hopeful that its third chance in court will be its charm.

More trees than ever are standing dead in Colorado forests Avalanche GM Joe Sakic continues to listen to offers as trade deadline approaches Editorial: Lying Trump’s bad example claims a Cabinet member The Latest: New York Times reports calls between Trump team, Russia By Alistair Barr and Mark Bergen, Bloomberg News For the past year, Google’s car project has been a talent sieve, thanks to leadership changes, strategy doubts, new startup dreams and rivals luring self-driving technology experts. Another force pushing people out? Money. A lot of it. Early staffers had an unusual compensation system that awarded supersized payouts based on the project’s value. By late 2015, the numbers were so big that several veteran members didn’t need the job security anymore, making them more open to other opportunities, according to people familiar with the situation. In December, the car unit morphed into a standalone business called Waymo, and the system was replaced with a more uniform pay structure that treats all employees the same, according to a person familiar with the situation. Still, the original program got so costly that a top executive at parent Alphabet Inc. highlighted it last year to explain a jump in expenses. A spokeswoman for Alphabet, the holding company that owns Google and “Other Bets” like the autonomous car business, declined to comment. The payouts contributed to a talent exodus at a time when the company was trying to turn the project into a real business and emerging rivals were recruiting heavily. The episode highlights Alphabet’s difficult transition from a digital advertising giant into a diversified technology company with varied groups of employees requiring different incentives. Other new businesses, including health care unit Verily, use different compensation systems too, but they have yet to generate huge payouts like the car project. The unorthodox system started in 2010, soon after Google unveiled its first self-driving vehicle. It was constructed to tie employees’ fortunes to the performance of the project, rather than Google’s advertising money machine. In addition to cash salaries, some staffers were given bonuses and equity in the business and these awards were set aside in a special entity.

Not so fast, California says After several years, Google applied a multiplier to the value of the awards and paid some or all of it out. The multiplier was based on periodic valuations of the division, the people said. The precise metrics that the division was measured by — and caused the bonuses to balloon — are not known. But by 2015, the Google car project had come a long way: Google’s vehicles had logged more than one million autonomous miles; car companies including Toyota and Tesla announced their own plans to develop autonomous systems; and analysts predicted the technology would transform the auto industry. A large multiplier was applied to the compensation packages in late 2015, resulting in multimillion-dollar payments in some cases, according to the people familiar with the situation. One member of the team had a multiplier of 16 applied to bonuses and equity amassed over four years, one of the people said. They asked not to be identified talking about private matters. Part of the problem was that payouts snowballed after key milestones were reached, even though the ultimate goal of the project — fully autonomous vehicles provided to the public through commercial services — remained years away. It’s unclear how much the payouts cost Alphabet, however, chief financial officer Ruth Porat talked about it during an earnings conference call with analysts in early 2016. Operating expenses in the fourth quarter of 2015 rose 14 percent to $6.6 billion, “primarily driven by R&D expense, particularly affected by expenses resulting from project milestones in Other Bets established several years ago,” Porat said, according to a transcript. The CFO wasn’t specific, but one of the people familiar with the situation said the comments referred to the car project compensation. Staff departures from the car division increased in 2016. Some were frustrated with the pace of progress and had doubts about new leader John Krafcik, while others wanted to start their own autonomous vehicle companies, people familiar with the matter said. The big payouts exacerbated the situation because team members had less financial incentive to stay, the people familiar with the situation said. Chris Urmson, previous leader of the project, departed in August and is working on a startup. Other early project members left to form Otto, a self-driving trucking company that was quickly snapped up by Uber Technologies Inc. Bryan Salesky, a former Google car executive, started Argo AI, which got a $1 billion investment from Ford Motor Co. on Friday. Urmson and Salesky didn’t respond to requests for comment. Sebastian Thrun, who started the car project and helped design the pay system, didn’t respond to questions, either. During the early 2016 conference call, Porat suggested a different approach to incentives at Other Bets in the future. “It is about getting more ambitious things done. We’re doing that in a framework to ensure we are disciplined with our resources, and this was just calling out a milestone established some time ago,” she said.

Certifications that stand out Google Assistant Might Make Appearance on More Smartphones By Shirley Siluk / NewsFactor Network PUBLISHED: FEBRUARY 13 2017 Judging by reports from some Android device users late last week, the intelligent Google Assistant might eventually be appearing on devices other than the Pixel smartphones. Following a tip from a reader named Paden Rivers, Android Police reported Friday that some users of the Google App beta channel saw a v6.13 "alpha" update that allowed them to use Google Assistant on their non-Pixel phones. The intelligent assistant could be activated on some devices after pressing the Home button. Unveiled at Google's I/O developers conference last year, the official version of Google Assistant is currently available only on the Pixel (pictured above) and Pixel XL smartphones, as well as on the smart Google Home device. Google CEO Sundar Pichai described Assistant as part of his company's transition to a smarter and more personalized search service built on machine learning and artificial intelligence. Appearing, then Disappearing, Assistant Commenting on an Android Police post describing Google App v6.13, Rivers on Friday posted a screenshot of his phone along with the note, "I have cricket idol 4, and with the apk from this post, I have Google assistant." Other readers followed up to report seeing similar results on their Android phones. Testers on the Android Police team found that Google App v6.13 enabled Google Assistant on about half of the Android devices they tried, while the rest continued to launch Google Now on Tap instead. Among the devices that ran Google Assistant were a Nexus 6P, a Samsung Galaxy Note 5 and a Xiaomi Redmi Note 3. Many commenters, including Rivers, later reported that Google Assistant had disappeared from their phones, which then reverted to launching Google Now on Tap when they pressed their Home buttons. "Most of us already assume Google Assistant will appear on more phones at some point," software engineer Cody Toombs wrote in his analysis of Google App v6.13. "It couldn't remain an exclusive forever." Now Live: Instant Tethering Beyond the Pixel and Pixel XL, the next smartphone to come with Google Assistant built in could be LG's G6, expected to debut at this year's Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, according to a report by CNET late last month. Mobile World Congress is scheduled to run Feb. 27 through March 2. In another Google development, the company has started rolling out a feature called Instant Tethering for users of some Pixel and Nexus smartphones. First seen in testing last month, Instant Tethering allows users to share cellular data connections between devices using a Wi-Fi hotspot and one-tap activation through Google Play Services. Instant Tethering enables users to automatically share data connections as hosts using the Pixel, Pixel XL, Nexus 5X, Nexus 6 and Nexus 6P running Android 7.1.1 and up. Device users can share such connections without hosting if they have one of the above devices -- or a Nexus 9 or Pixel C -- running Android 6.0 and up. Image Credit: Google.

Disney Ends Deal with YouTube Star Next Article > Disney Ends Deal with YouTube Star Over Anti-Semitic Stunt By Mae Anderson PUBLISHED: FEBRUARY 14 2017 Disney's Maker Studios and Google's YouTube are distancing themselves from a top YouTube star after he made jokes construed as anti-Semitic and posted Nazi imagery in his videos. Felix Kjellberg, known online as PewDiePie, has the most popular YouTube channel, with more than 53 million subscribers. The Swedish YouTube star rose to fame by posting videos of him playing and commenting about video games. More recently, he branched out into non-gaming videos that show him performing skits, stunts or making jokes. Disney, whose Maker Studios runs Kjellberg's channels and network, said he crossed the line with some of his videos. One video from January shows two Indian men paid by Kjellberg to hold up a sign that says "Death to all Jews." Kjellberg said the video was meant to demonstrate how far people will go if they get paid to do something, but he didn't think they would actually do it. Other videos show Nazi imagery in a satirical way. In blog post Kjellberg said he was making jokes, but realizes now that they were offensive. Kjellberg's channel was already part of Maker Studios when the Walt Disney Co. bought Maker in 2014 for $675 million. Maker contracts with individuals such as Kjellberg to produce videos for various YouTube channels. Kjellberg pulled the video showing the two men displaying the anti-Semitic sign, but it is excerpted in a Wall Street Journal video. Other videos still on the site show Nazi imagery being used satirically. Maker Studios said in a statement that while Kjellberg's channel is popular because he is irreverent and provocative, the studio is ending its affiliation with him because he went too far. YouTube spokeswoman Michelle Slavich said YouTube has canceled the release of the second season of Kjellberg's reality show "Scare PewDiePie" and removed the PewDiePie channel from its Google Preferred advertising program, which aggregates top YouTube content for advertisers to buy time on.

It goes without saying that the Sport is a big watch. It’s the watch that has all the features — bringing you everything that Android Wear 2.0 has to offer — and it’s also the watch that has all the bulk. But there’s more to the story here than just its size… Size Since we’re on the topic of size, though, let’s just get that out of the way. The LG Watch Sport is a big smartwatch, but not completely out of the realm of understandable when you consider huge traditional watches. The device has a larger screen than the LG Watch Style coming in at 1.38-inches, it weighs 3.2 oz (or 89.4 g), its body is 45.4 mm wide and x 51.2 mm tall, and it’s a full 14.2 mm thick. For perspective, this is bigger than the widely-considered-huge LG Watch Urbane 2nd gen. LTE, which is 44.5 x 44.5 x 14.2 mm — although notably exactly as thick. And that thickness is really the biggest pain point. I have small-to-average size wrists, and the watch is unwieldy enough for me that I would be unlikely to wear it full time. Have small wrists? You can forget about trying this watch entirely. Compare the watch to something a bit more dainty like the 38mm Apple Watch (which happens to be the watch size that I personally enjoy the most)? This thing is in an entirely different ballpark. The Apple Watch Series 2 38mm aluminum is just 28.2 g, which is roughly 1/3 of the weight of this behemoth. I think you get the idea — it’s not gonna work for a lot of people. But Google makes it completely clear in its marketing video for these two new watches that you should be able to use the LG Watch Sport as a complete replacement for your smartphone in some cases, and for people that have wrists big enough to complement the watch, maybe that’s a use case. The trade off with the big size is that the watch brings all the goodies: LTE for cellular connectivity, NFC for Android Pay, two extra buttons, a heart rate sensor, and a bigger battery. Style Even for people that the watch will work for, though, the LG Watch Sport definitely isn’t without compromise. We heard that the watch would go without interchangeable bands in rumors prior to launch, and I’ve unfortunately confirmed that these bands are not replaceable at all. You’re stuck with the band that the watch ships with, and that’s mostly because the band at the top of the watch — which is also uncomfortable rigid — is filled with cellular radios as ArsTechnica found. Beyond that, the watch definitely has a sport-y look to it. The TPU straps are made with an assumption that you’re going to be sweating a bit, and they’re comfortable enough for working out with. Overall, the overall design of the watch definitely feels in the same category as other “sport” watches in this space like the outdoor watch made by Casio or the Moto 360 Sport. It’s bigger than usual, its bands are permanently affixed, and its front-face is just a basic 316L stainless steel. ‘Digital Crown’ + buttons One of the big wins with this watch in my eyes is the newly added rotating side button (or RSB, as Google calls it). It’s effectively and functionally the same as the Digital Crown from the Apple Watch, and I think it’s a great experience. This crown is big enough that you can actually use two fingers to spin it, while I’ve found myself in testing before just using the one-finger slide with the Apple Watch. There’s also two new buttons on the side of the device, which is something we saw before on the LG Watch Urbane 2nd gen. LTE. Both of these are completely programmable to whichever apps you’d like, but the top is set to Google Fit and the bottom to Android Pay out of the box. I think these are nifty and helpful shortcuts for jumping to often-used apps. This crown can basically replace any swiping that you used to do on the screen of the watch. Before, swiping felt inaccurate and unreliable at times and it always felt like the screen was too small to really hit the tap targets you were going for. It’s still a pain to tap tiny icons (like app icons in the new scrolling app list), but at least you don’t have to swipe up and down on the screen anymore and accidentally tap those tiny and frustrating buttons along the way. You can use the new “digital crown” to navigate though notifications on the main screen, scroll through text messages, scroll through the app list, and more. For me, this feels like a huge step forward for the UI of Android Wear 2.0, and while I still think that Samsung has the best-of-the-best design with its Gear S line (that rotating bezel is killer), this implementation is much better than nothing. Performance And this leads us into what I think is another huge win for the LG Watch Sport (and Android Wear 2.0 in general): performance. I have long been frustrated with bad and stuttery performance on most Android Wear watches (most recently the ASUS ZenWatch 3) I’ve reviewed. This one isn’t perfect, but you can definitely tell a difference with the LG Watch Sport and AW 2.0. Just like the Pixel, it seems Google’s involvement with the product’s development actually matters. Navigating around the UI is much smoother and the UI itself I think is better designed to accommodate this better performance (for example, you don’t have to swipe between multiple screens just to reach the quick setting you’re looking for). There’s still an issue I’ve noticed where the watch will take a while to function at full speed immediately after waking it up, but that problem is lessened and performance otherwise is about as smooth as I’ve seen on a smartwatch. One notable exception in this area for me was Google Assistant. While voice commands and transcription is supposed to be a lot faster in Android Wear, I haven’t noticed much difference quite yet. Perhaps there is something wrong with my cellular connection (or something wrong with the connection between my watch and my phone), but I feel like using Google Assistant is almost as slow as using voice commands was on previous versions of Android Wear. And that’s really slow. Wrap up Personally, I’m not a fan — but that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t be! I like the watches that I wear to be on the smaller side in general, and I’m not aching to have a “sport” smartwatch that acts as a complete smartphone replacement while working out. That really feels like what Google was going for here, and it’s just not for me. I like my workout time to be one of the few moments in my day that I unplug. I think the Style would be more up my alley, but as you might know, that watch simply misses a lot of features that are otherwise bringing Android Wear up to par with the competition (at least in this case with the LG Watch Sport). We’ll have our full review later this week, and a quick hands-on with the Style soon, but for now my conclusion is the same as many others: Google and LG built two watches that don’t really appeal to me. And this one, despite having all the features, appeals even less to me than the cheaper, smaller, and more stylish alternative.

 A 26-year-old explains why she told Google before accepting a job that she'd quit after 2 years Áine Cain Feb. 13, 2017, 1:45 PM 116,643 facebook linkedin twitter email print WayUp CEO and cofounder Liz Wessel always knew she wanted to be an entrepreneur. Liz Wessel WayUp CEO and cofounder Liz Wessel knew she ultimately wanted to be an entrepreneur. That's why before she could accept a job offer from Google in her senior year of college, she needed to run something by the recruiter. "I said, 'I am really interested in taking this, but if I take it, I want to leave in two years and start a company. How do you guys feel about that?'" she told Business Insider. "'I'm telling you to hire me because I'm entrepreneurial, but that's also the reason I'm not going to be here way too long. I'm going to want to be entrepreneurial by starting a company. That has to be OK.'" As a student at the University of Pennsylvania, Wessel founded her own company, worked as an Anheuser-Busch campus ambassador, and interned on Google's marketing team. "I loved my summer there," the now 26-year-old said. "I had the best experience. I worked with brilliant people. Everything about it was pretty fantastic." All that experience helped Wessel figure out she wanted to build a product to help college students get jobs. She also knew she wanted to gain more experience working at a tech company like Google. When she got the job offer, she was excited. "At the same time, I knew I wanted to start a company in two years," Wessel said. "I was very adamant about starting a company while I was still young and could take big risks — not that you can't when you're older, but I just was really excited about the concept of it." When she spoke to the Google recruiter about her plans, she found them quite supportive, and they listed several Google alumni who went on to found their own companies, Wessel said. Wessel says her experience reflects a new normal when it comes to employment. CNN reports that workers now switch jobs an average of four times before hitting 32. As CEO of an online platform that connects college students with jobs, Wessel says she draws on her own experience when talking with employees. She said that if a worker at WayUp were to tell her they were going to leave in two years to start a business, she'd be thrilled. "My response is, 'As long as you let me invest, I'm happy with that,'" she said. Get the latest Google stock price here.

Much of that money has gone to engineers and other staff, according to a new report from Bloomberg. In order to keep self-driving staffers happy — and, presumably, from leaving the company for other firms doing similar work — Google backed the proverbial Brinks truck up to the self-driving department and unloaded. Bloomberg says that early staffers “had an unusual compensation system” that multiplied staffers' salaries and bonuses based on the performance of the self-driving project. The payments accumulated as milestones were reached, even though Waymo remains years away from generating revenue. One staffer eventually “had a multiplier of 16 applied to bonuses and equity amassed over four years.” The huge amounts of compensation worked — for a while. But eventually, it gave many staffers such financial security that they were willing to leave the cuddly confines of Google. “f-you money” Two staffers that Bloomberg spoke to called it “F-you money,” and the accumulated cash allowed them to depart Google for other firms, including Chris Urmson who co-founded a startup with ex-Tesla employee Sterling Anderson, and others who founded a self-driving truck company called Otto which was purchased by Uber last year, and another who founded Argo AI which received a $1 billion investment from Ford last week. In 2015, Google’s parent company Alphabet lost a mind-boggling $3.5 billion on “other bets” like the self-driving project, and lost another billion dollars in the last quarter of 2016 alone. The company has a lot of projects in the “other bets” category, so not all can be blamed on self-driving cars, but the decision to spin off the project into Waymo could make the financials look a bit better. To be sure, the autonomous car space is ultra-competitive right now, with top dollar being thrown at experienced engineers by tech and car companies alike — but perhaps Google was a little ahead of the curve. Sure, its self-driving technology is among the best in the industry, but it’s not clear if its head start will translate into dollars down the road.

Lasting for four days, the delightful Doodle is all about pangolins and love. It features a multi-level game starring a small rolling pangolin; using the arrow keys and the space bar, people can send the little pangolin rolling across Ghana, India, China (where it swings from ribbons attached to lanterns) and the Philippines. There are eight pangolin species, which not coincidentally, live in all those regions. The initiative is meant to raise awareness about the endangered pangolins, which are threatened by trafficking. The World Wildlife Fund describes the unique creature as “the world's only truly scaly mammal.”  GOOGLE AND LG DEBUT ANDROID WEAR 2.0 WITH NEW WATCHES “Pangolins are the most-trafficked mammals in the world, in high demand by consumers for their meat and their unique scales,” the WWF said. “More than one million pangolins have been illegally taken from the wild to be used in fashion products and purported medicinal remedies.” In addition to the game, the Google Doodle also includes facts about pangolins— like about how long their tongues are (which they use to grab food like ants and termites), or how the babies ride on their mother’s tales, or that their scales are made from keratin.  Check out the Doodle and the game here.

Google Maps is getting a proper lists feature that allows you to create new lists, share them with others, and even follow those from your buddies. This feature was first introduced back in August of last year to Google’s Local Guides program. Today, though, it comes to everyone else.  You’ll get a good feel for how it works in the video above, but the basics are this. As you look-up a restaurant or other location and perform a swipe up on the listing, you’ll be treated to a “Save” button in the middle of the screen. By tapping that, you’ll then get to choose where to save the place to. You could go with pre-made lists for Favorites, Want to go, and Starred spots, or you could create your own custom lists. I’m thinking lists like, “New Beer Spots” or “Burger Places in NYC I Need to Visit That May Leave Me in a Coma.” To get back into your lists, a swipe out of the side menu followed by a tap on “My places” will get you to them all. From there, you can edit lists or share them with another person through a variety of options. Let us know as you see the new feature go live!

An FTC official has announced that the firm is looking into whether or not Google “thwarted competition” in the OS market. Currently, the Android marketshare in South Korea sits at more than 80% of devices. Specifically, the FTC is examining the Mobile Application Distribution Agreement signed by Google and Samsung in 2011 that requires all Android handsets to have Google set as the default search engine and to have several Google apps pre-installed on any Android devices. Samsung and Google also had an anti-fragmentation agreement that would prevent Samsung from developing a new OS using Google’s algorithms. This isn’t the first time Google has been subjected to an anti-competitive suit in the country, as search engines Naver and Daum complained back in 2013 about the MADA that keeps Google as the default search engine on Android devices. Google was cleared in that suit after the anti-trust investigation stated that marketshare for these search engines was not impacted. This renewed interest in examining whether Google is chaining manufacturers with its requirements has led the FTC to review whether this case from 2013 should be reinvestigated, while Google maintains that because Android is open source, partners are free to use the OS as they see fit. “Android is an open source platform. Our partner agreements are entirely voluntary — anyone can use Android without Google. The Android OS can be downloaded for free. It can be modified and used to build a phone. Many companies have used Android’s source code as the starting point for their own operating systems.” While Google’s stance on the open nature of Android has been standard any time the company has been accused of anti-competitive practices, this isn’t the first time the company has been subject to these complaints. The Russian government fined Google $6.75 million last year for violations, while the EU says the company is in breach of anti-trust rules. local_offer    Android   Google   Samsung   South Korea   Auto-load comments: Off On View comments (22) stars Further Reading New Google Phone app teardown reveals RCS calling features Android security director says no confirmed Stagefright cases found Google wants to add calling feature to Google Home The 128GB Black Pixel XL is back in stock Galaxy S8 launch details coming Feb 27 stars Popular this Weeklaunch 1 more_vertGet a free pizza from T-Mobile and Papa John's closeGet some free pizza courtesy of Papa John’s and T-Mobile Tuesdays Starting on February 14th, and lasting for 4 weeks, T-Mobile has partnered with Papa John’s to give T-Mobile Tuesday users a free large pizza and 25% off regular menu orders. 2 more_vertThe Moto G5 Plus has been leaked in its entirety closeThe Moto G5 Plus has been confirmed after showing up via an online retailer The upcoming Moto G5 Plus has been leaked in its entirely after the device was published through an online retailer.

SUBSCRIBE The impact (and lack thereof) of Google’s mobile popup algorithm Back in August 2016, Google warned that it would be releasing an algorithm to crack down on interstitials on mobile pages. Now that the update has been live for a month, columnist Glenn Gabe shares his findings on the impact. Glenn Gabe on February 10, 2017 at 10:16 am More It’s not often that Google announces an algorithm update in advance. But when they do, not only can webmasters prepare for that update, we can also track its rollout once Google pulls the trigger. That provides a rare opportunity to gauge the impact of the algorithm update and determine what its effects are. That’s exactly what I’ve been doing since January 10, 2017. In August of 2016, Google announced that they would be rolling out an update on January 10, 2017, that could impact URLs employing intrusive mobile popups or interstitials. For example, if a URL presented an interstitial that covered a substantial part of the content, then that URL could be demoted in the mobile search results. The web as a whole cheered, as many users were extremely frustrated by aggressive mobile popups. So, as January approached, many SEOs, webmasters and business owners wondered what the actual impact would be. Would there be mass casualties, minor bumps in the algorithmic road or something in between? Based on Google’s announcement, you would think that sites employing intrusive popups or interstitials would have gotten smoked by the algorithm. That would make sense, but when you’re dealing in an algorithmic world, the devil is in the details. Preparing for the mobile popup algorithm As the rollout neared, I had many questions. Would the update actually work? How extreme would it be? Would there be loopholes? How would it impact branded versus non-branded queries? Would large-scale sites be impacted as much as smaller sites? And so on and so forth. That’s why I prepared for the update by collecting as many sites using mobile popups or interstitials as possible. My goal was to benchmark those sites and then gauge the impact as the mobile popup algorithm rolled out. I’m now tracking close to 70 domains on my mobile popup list — and those sites are across verticals, including news publishers, entertainment, sports, e-commerce retailers, bloggers, music and more. Starting on January 10, I began checking my list twice per day to see which sites were still breaking the rules and which ones weren’t. And for the ones breaking the new Google mobile popup law, how much negative impact would they see? Would they see any impact at all? My travels along the popup algorithm trail My research took me across many sites, both large and small, across many categories and locations. It was fascinating to see which sites raised the white flag and stopped using popups or interstitials and which ones stood their ground and kept them. It was also eye-opening to analyze the various ways websites employed popups and interstitials in this new world (if they kept them). It was enlightening, to say the least. And of course, I was able to see many different types of ads and interstitials, including benign newsletter signups, aggressive ads that take over your screen, autoplay video in popups, broken ads in popups, and even malware and malicious downloads from ads in popups. There were times I felt like I needed battle armor while visiting some sites. Credit: Giphy Below, I’ll cover the impact, the non-impact, the natural side effects of a preannounced Google algorithm update, examples of popups and interstitials, and other interesting notes. So join me on a ride through mobile popup land. January 10, 2017: The rollout begins When the rollout began, I was excited to check my list and determine if there was any impact. As you can guess, there wasn’t much to report on the first day. The algorithm had to fully roll out, so I began checking my list twice per day to gauge the impact. And as I was checking the mobile SERPs, I ended up finding even more sites using mobile popups and interstitials. So my list was naturally growing as time went on. On January 12, I noticed what I believed were the first signs of impact, and I wrote a post to document my findings. My plan was to keep adding findings to that post as I came across more and more impact. Well, that didn’t turn out very well. After some initial movement, there seemed to be very little impact (if any at all). I kept updating my post with disclaimers about the lack of impact I was seeing. I was floored. I thought for sure the domains I was tracking would see some movement, but I was wrong. I checked twice per day, only to see many of the URLs from those domains ranking exactly where they did prior to the rollout. As of today, I’m still not seeing widespread impact. Again, many of the URLs across the domains I’m tracking are ranking exactly where they did prior to the rollout of the mobile popup algorithm. Therefore, I’m officially calling the mobile popup algorithm a dud. Sure, that can change if Google strengthens the algorithm or refines it, but for now, it’s not doing very much. Examples of popups and interstitials still in use You might be wondering what I’m seeing when checking sites. Well, I’ve seen it all since January 10: newsletter signups, popups on scroll, delayed popups, multi-ad interstitials, autoplay video, broken popups, malware, malicious downloads, multiple popups on one page, and so on. Without revealing the sites, here is a potpourri of popups and interstitials I have come across during my travels. These are all from URLs that currently rank highly for competitive keywords — and ranked there before the algorithm update rolled out. Also, the desktop and mobile rankings are equivalent. In other words, I’m not seeing a drop in the mobile SERPs when compared to desktop, which would happen if the mobile popup algorithm were impacting rankings. I’ll see you on the other side. That’s where I’ll cover the true impact of the mobile popup algorithm — and it might not be what you’re thinking. And many more… The true impact of the mobile popup algorithm Well, the true impact has nothing to do with mobile rankings being impacted, a slide in mobile traffic or anything related to SEO. Instead, it has everything to do with the reaction of publishers to the news that the algorithm was going to roll out. For example, many publishers removed mobile popups and interstitials as January 10, 2017, approached. They simply didn’t want to get hit or test the algorithmic waters. I saw this a lot as I was collecting sites that were employing mobile popups. This also included sites removing the popups after January 10. Not every company knew about the algorithm update, so some were late to the game. My guess is that the algorithm got on their radar based on news of the rollout, so those publishers had a knee-jerk reaction and simply removed their popups without gauging the actual impact. They basically trusted that the mobile popup algorithm was working without evidence of it actually working. And I get that. If you’re not neck-deep in SEO, you might not be familiar with the gray area of algorithms, and you might not know that some algorithm updates simply don’t work as expected. For those people, they just knew it was rolling out, that it could potentially negatively impact their rankings and traffic, and they pulled the popups and interstitials from their sites. But like I said earlier, the devil is in the details. Again, I’m not seeing any widespread impact from the mobile popup algorithm as I write this post. High risk, high reward: Will Google turn up the dial? And here’s the rub. The publishers I mentioned earlier that stood their ground and refused to remove their mobile popups and interstitials have braved the mighty tsunami that never arrived. They stood on the beach facing a powerful surge of water that would surely suck the mobile life out of their sites… and nothing happened. But that’s for now. Google can absolutely turn up the dial and strengthen the mobile popup algorithm at any time. And if they do, then those sites using mobile popups or interstitials could get smoked. But that’s a big could. Now, I’m not saying mobile popups are a good thing. I actually can’t stand most of them, and users overall hate them. That should be enough to rid them from the web, but they do work conversion-wise (unfortunately). So, we have a situation where an algorithm that should impact URLs employing mobile popups is not living up to expectations, and a marketing tactic that drives conversion was removed from many sites. I don’t know where we go from here, but I fear more sites will test the algorithmic waters and add those popups back. And it’s hard to blame them. So, based on what I explained in this post, I’ll provide some closing points below. Key points Although there hasn’t been widespread impact yet, Google can turn up the dial at any time. I know many people are still hoping that happens; and if it does, sites using mobile popups or interstitials can get hit. Remember, high risk, high reward. Publishers are still figuring out ways to push the envelope with mobile popups in order to determine which formats and techniques will get hit and which ones won’t. But based on my research, there’s very little negative impact overall so far. I recommend watching my initial post for more updates. Never simply take Google’s word for it. Track and test updates for yourself. I’m glad I decided to gather close to 70 sites using mobile popups and interstitials. That enabled me to test how strong the algorithm was and if it was doing what it was supposed to do. Mobile popups and interstitials are horrible user experience-wise, but they perform well conversion-wise. Based on the lack of impact from the mobile popup algorithm, I fear we will see more sites testing the waters and adding them back. It pains me to say that… but the lack of impact is clear. Summary: The waiting continues When January 10 arrived, I was eager to gauge the impact of the mobile popup algorithm. But what I wasn’t prepared for was to see very little happen. And that’s exactly what occurred while checking many sites still using mobile popups and interstitials. Moving forward, keep an eye on my Twitter feed and my original findings post. I will keep checking my list, and checking it twice, in order to see if the mobile popup algorithm is being naughty or nice.

The LG Watch Style and LG Watch Sport the first smartwatches to be powered by the latest iteration of Google’s wearable device platform. Even though it has just been a couple of days since these devices were launched, they are now available for purchase from several retailers. It has been quite a while since one of Google’s partners released a new Android Wear smartwatch. Google has worked with LG on these devices and it’s evident that they’re meant to just push Google’s software as they’re not really pushing the envelope on design or functionality. The LG Watch Style is for those who are looking for the entry-level model. It’s the cheapest of the two at $249 but also provides less functionality as it lacks LTE, NFC, etc. The LG Watch Style can be purchased in Silver and Titanium colors for $249 while the Rose Gold one is being sold for $279. It’s now available for purchase via the Google Store. The LG Watch Sport is a bit more expensive but also offers greater functionality. For example, it has support for GPS, NFC, and LTE.

MSPU Windows Phone Windows 10 Surface Xbox Enterprise Tip us Settings Text Input: Windows 10 Windows Phone Surface Xbox Enterprise Settings Tip us Forum Text Input: Google drops AdMob support for Windows Phone 8 0 by Michael Allison  @Mkeallison Sep 1, 2016 at 16:15 GMT6 months ago Google may be offering limited for universal Windows Apps, but its benevolence doesn’t extend to old style Windows Phone 8 apps . According to a report from Platfo, Google is now deprecating support for AdMob for Windows Phone 8 devices, and will withdraw the SDK and all documentation from their online website. While Windows Phone and AdMob have had some trouble in the past, Google pulling support for it entirely is somewhat unfortunate for developers. Although, given the low market share of Windows phones across the board, Google’s historical (lack of) support for the platform, and the dead-end nature of Windows phone 8 apps, the decision isn’t entirely out of the blue. However, as Microsoft has moved to the universal Windows Platform, their support for developers (at least in this aspect) has grown somewhat with new advertising and monetization opportunities now available. What do you think of this development? Let us know in the comments below. Some links in the article may not be viewable as you are using an AdBlocker.

português suomeksi svenska Thales Leads the Industry with Data Security Controls for Cloud Services Leading cloud providers collaborate with Thales to give enterprises control of their encryption keys News provided by Thales Feb 13, 2017, 08:11 ET Share this article SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 13, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- RSA Conference -- Thales, a leader in critical information systems, cybersecurity and data security, announces its high-assurance data security technology is integrated with the leading cloud service provider platforms from Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google, Microsoft and Salesforce, allowing users to establish strong safeguards around their sensitive data and applications in the cloud, and giving them greater control and flexibility. Click to Tweet: We're flying high! The past few months have seen #cloud integrations w/@Microsoft @Google @Salesforce http://bit.ly/2kuvUnd As organizations transition to digital business models, security is seen as one of the biggest inhibitors to their digital transformation. By collaborating with the world's leading cloud service providers, Thales is making it easier to implement security in both traditional data center and cloud deployments, ensuring organizations retain control over their encryption keys and their data. Together with Microsoft, Thales pioneered "bring your own key" (BYOK), enabling enterprises to keep control of the keys used in Microsoft Azure. The resulting Microsoft Azure Key Vault with enhanced key controls, enabled by the Thales nShield hardware security module (HSM), allows enterprises to safeguard sensitive data, manage keys and maintain control. Today we announced a collaboration with Microsoft to provide key management services for Microsoft Azure and Microsoft Office 365 that will allow organizations to maximize the control of their data and provide the highest levels of assurance, regardless of whether the data is on premise or in the cloud. Organizations using Amazon Web Services Key Management (AWS KMS) can take advantage of enhanced security and control of the encryption keys they use in the cloud, and revoke or retire those keys as necessary through BYOK with hardware protection provided by Thales HSMs. Also announced today was support for Google Cloud Platform's Customer-Supplied Encryption Key (CSEK) functionality. Google Cloud Platform customers can now generate, protect and supply their encryption keys to the cloud using an on-premise, FIPS-certified nShield HSM from Thales. This empowers enterprise customers who want to move workloads and data to the Google Cloud Platform but need to retain control of their key material on premise. The Salesforce Shield Platform Encryption enables enterprises using Salesforce to natively encrypt data at rest across their Salesforce apps without compromising business functionality. Thales Key Management-as-a-Service for Salesforce adds controls that enable organizations to help meet compliance and best-practice requirements by storing, managing and maintaining tenant secrets used to derive encryption keys within a secure Thales-hosted environment. Thales support for RESTful API provides crypto-as-a-service capabilities that enables organizations to deliver cryptographic services with more ease and flexibility, allowing easier integration with applications and deployment into public, private and hybrid cloud environments. Users can implement their key management and crypto functionality independently and without needing to understand the details of the nShield HSM environment – ensuring the time from project inception to application deployment is reduced to a minimum. Peter Galvin, vice president strategy at Thales e-Security says: "The security of any cloud service depends on the level of protection given to the cryptographic keys used to protect the confidentiality and integrity of sensitive data. One cannot underscore enough how hugely important this is. These keys are the root of trust in an enterprise's entire system – if they are lost, so is the data. If they are stolen, secrets might not stay secret for long. Thales is collaborating with the leading cloud service providers to ensure enterprises are able to control their cryptographic keys and therefore trust that service with their most valuable assets, giving them the confidence to accelerate their cloud deployments." About Thales e-Security Thales e-Security is the leader in advanced data security solutions and services that deliver trust wherever information is created, shared or stored. We ensure that the data belonging to companies and government entities is both secure and trusted in any environment – on-premise, in the cloud, in data centers or big data environments – without sacrificing business agility. Security doesn't just reduce risk, it's an enabler of the digital initiatives that now permeate our daily lives – digital money, e-identities, healthcare, connected cars and with the internet of things (IoT) even household devices. Thales provides everything an organization needs to protect and manage its data, identities and intellectual property and meet regulatory compliance – through encryption, advanced key management, tokenization, privileged user control and high assurance solutions. Security professionals around the globe rely on Thales to confidently accelerate their organization's digital transformation. Thales e-Security is part of Thales Group.

 Google Chrome is about to revolutionize virtual reality BI Intelligence Feb. 13, 2017, 12:15 PM 6,770 facebook linkedin twitter email print BI Intelligence See Also THE VIRTUAL REALITY REPORT: How the early days of VR are unfolding and the challenges it must overcome to reach mass adoption Here's how Mark Zuckerberg thinks the VR industry will evolve Lenovo just unveiled a $400 VR headset This story was delivered to BI Intelligence Apps and Platforms Briefing subscribers. To learn more and subscribe, please click here. Google announced last week that the latest version of Chrome, its popular web browser, will support virtual reality (VR) on the web, allowing any user to view VR content on any device, across any platform. For a more immersive experience, users can view WebVR content on Daydream-ready devices, such as the Pixel. Users without a Daydream headset or compatible device can still view the content, but in a 360-video-type fashion, similar to Google's Street View. For now, only a few websites offer VR content, however, Google is working with developers to increase this number. The company also revealed it will be opening WebVR to other VR headsets, like Cardboard and Oculus Rift.  WebVR has gained plenty of attention recently, with Facebook's Oculus and Samsung Gear VR both adding WebVR support in the last few months. That’s because WebVR has multiple benefits for consumers and developers alike, which ultimately helps platforms: WebVR makes VR much more accessible to consumers. WebVR is more accessible to consumers than the less affordable computer- and console-powered headsets, like the HTC Vive and PlayStation VR. It's also available on both the web and the headset, therefore broadening the content base. WebVR could incentivize developers to build more VR content. Support for browser apps could lure in developers that were initially reluctant to make moves until they assessed how adoption of the technology would evolve. As competition between VR platforms continues to heat up, having more developers building content is key to attracting the best VR experiences. Web apps also make it easier for potential users to sample new VR content without needing to download and store it on their phones. Because of the complexity of VR content, it can be a drain on both phone storage and battery life. Accessing this content over the web fixes at least one of these issues since users can essentially stream the content from the web.  Broad adoption of VR content could make the tech more appealing to businesses looking for new ways to engage with consumers. Currently, VR is probably most suited to gaming and video viewing, however, it also has ample opportunity to disrupt mobile applications focused on education, conference calls, and medical procedures, for example. And although the technology is still fairly nascent, early studies indicate that the immersive nature of VR video content is leading to higher engagement and emotional responses to ads shown over the medium, according to YuMe. As adoption increases, it will be integral to have a VR-video strategy in place to reach these consumers. The virtual reality (VR) market has made significant strides throughout 2016. New VR headsets like the Oculus Rift and the HTC Vive debuted amid great consumer anticipation, while VR content launches kept pace, with Batman: Arkham VR and Chair In A Room garnering encouraging download totals. At the same time, industry groups and conferences brought developers, investors, and content producers together, helping to further ramp up buzz in this nascent space.    BI Intelligence, Business Insider’s premium research service, forecasts shipments of VR headsets to spike by 1047% year-over-year (YoY) to 8.2 million in 2016. This growth will help propel the virtual reality space to exceed $1 billion in revenue for the first time, according to research by Deloitte. Powering that growth is an estimated 271% increase in investment in AR (augmented reality) and VR companies from 2015, according to estimates from CB Insights. But while 2016 has indeed been an important year for the VR market, it hasn’t necessarily been a big one — at least not compared to its future growth potential. VR headset shipments will continue to grow in the years ahead, driven by the introduction of new content that will appeal to a broad swath of users.  Jessica Smith, research analyst for BI Intelligence, has compiled a detailed report on virtual reality that explores the highly fragmented and volatile VR market that emerged in 2016, lays out the future growth potential in numerous key VR hardware categories as driven by major VR platforms, and examines consumer sentiment and developer excitement for VR, presenting which headset categories and platforms are most poised for success in the near- to mid-term. Here are some key takeaways from the report: This has been an important foundational year for the VR market. New hardware and content have brought more options to market to appeal to a wider set of consumers.  But the growth seen this year is merely a foreshadowing of the future. The highly fragmented VR market today will eventually narrow as the market grows and matures. After considerable progress in 2016, the VR market is ripe for transformation in 2017. Developers, consumers, investors, and hardware makers have a host of options from which to choose, each with their own strengths and shortcomings. The environment is poised for the first killer VR app to hit the market sometime in 2017, which will be a major catalyst for consumer adoption of VR hardware. Not all headset categories and platforms will emerge as winners in the near future. More immersive headsets that offer the best VR experiences are too expensive for most consumers. Alternately, affordable headsets that rely on smartphones as processors offer sub-par experiences that can induce sickness. In full, the report: Identifies the major players in today's VR hardware and platform markets. Estimates future growth of each of the major VR categories.

Name: Subject: Message: Google investigated in South Korea over Android anti-fragmentation clause Newsby Mitja Rutnik3 days ago 8 604 10 Google is facing yet another anti–competitive investigation. This time, the Fair Trade Commission (FTC) in South Korea is investigating whether the search giant hindered Samsung’s development of its own mobile operating system. Back in 2011, Google and Samsung signed the Mobile Application Distribution Agreement (MADA) which states that Android smartphones made by the South Korean company have to have Google as the default search engine. In addition, the devices must also have a few Google’s apps pre-installed, including YouTube and Gmail. The two companies also reached the anti-fragmentation agreement (AFA) which specifies that Samsung is not allowed to develop its own mobile operating based on Android. Google was already under investigation because of MADA in South Korea, with the nation’s top two search engines — Naver and Daum — claiming that the agreement violates the Antitrust Law. The company was cleared of all charges by the FTC in 2013. See also: European Commission targets Google over further antitrust complaints July 14, 2016 Now, the FTC launched an investigation into the AFA agreement, stating that it may have obstructed Samsung to develop its own mobile OS. What’s more, the FTC also said that it will review the need to reinvestigate the 2013 MADA case, claiming that the situation on the market has since changed. If Google is found guilty, the company will most likely be hit with a big fine. It won’t be the first and probably not the last either. The search giant has been accused of antitrust practices quite a few times so far. Last year, it was fined $6.75 million for competition violations by the Russian government. The company also had a few problems on the old continent in 2016, as it was accused of breaching EU antitrust rules and abusing its dominant position on the market by enforcing restrictions on both manufacturers of Android devices as well as mobile carriers.

The Company Paid Them So Much 'F-you money' awarded to veteran team members boosted parent Alphabet’s R&D costs, prompting comment from the company's CFO by Alistair Barr @alistairmbarr More stories by Alistair Barr and Mark Bergen @mhbergen More stories by Mark Bergen February 13, 2017, 11:03 AM EST What's Fueling the Talent Drain at Google's Car Project? For the past year, Google's car project has been a talent sieve, thanks to leadership changes, strategy doubts, new startup dreams and rivals luring self-driving technology experts. Another force pushing people out? Money. A lot of it.  Early staffers had an unusual compensation system that awarded supersized payouts based on the project's value. By late 2015, the numbers were so big that several veteran members didn't need the job security anymore, making them more open to other opportunities, according to people familiar with the situation. Two people called it "F-you money." In December, the car unit morphed into a standalone business called Waymo, and the system was replaced with a more uniform pay structure that treats all employees the same, according to a person familiar with the situation. Still, the original program got so costly that a top executive at parent Alphabet Inc. highlighted it last year to explain a jump in expenses. A spokeswoman for Alphabet, the holding company that owns Google and "Other Bets" like the autonomous car business, declined to comment.  The payouts contributed to a talent exodus at a time when the company was trying to turn the project into a real business and emerging rivals were recruiting heavily. The episode highlights Alphabet's difficult transition from a digital advertising giant into a diversified technology company with varied groups of employees requiring different incentives. Other new businesses, including health care unit Verily, use different compensation systems too, but they have yet to generate huge payouts like the car project. The unorthodox system started in 2010, soon after Google unveiled its first self-driving vehicle. It was constructed to tie employees' fortunes to the performance of the project, rather than Google's advertising money machine. In addition to cash salaries, some staffers were given bonuses and equity in the business and these awards were set aside in a special entity. After several years, Google applied a multiplier to the value of the awards and paid some or all of it out. The multiplier was based on periodic valuations of the division, the people said.  The precise metrics that the division was measured by-- and caused the bonuses to balloon-- are not known. But by 2015, the Google car project had come a long way: Google’s vehicles had logged more than one million autonomous miles; car companies including Toyota Motor Corp. and Tesla Inc. announced their own plans to develop autonomous systems; and analysts predicted the technology would transform the auto industry. A large multiplier was applied to the compensation packages in late 2015, resulting in multi-million dollar payments in some cases, according to the people familiar with the situation. One member of the team had a multiplier of 16 applied to bonuses and equity amassed over four years, one of the people said. They asked not to be identified talking about private matters.  Part of the problem was that payouts snowballed after key milestones were reached, even though the ultimate goal of the project -- fully autonomous vehicles provided to the public through commercial services -- remained years away.  Ruth Porat Patrick T. Fallon/Bloomberg It’s unclear how much the payouts cost Alphabet, however, Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat talked about it during an earnings conference call with analysts in early 2016. Operating expenses in the fourth quarter of 2015 rose 14 percent to $6.6 billion, "primarily driven by R&D expense, particularly affected by expenses resulting from project milestones in Other Bets established several years ago," Porat said, according to a transcript. The CFO wasn’t specific, but one of the people familiar with the situation said the comments referred to the car project compensation. Exclusive insights on technology around the world. Get Fully Charged, from Bloomberg Technology. Sign Up Staff departures from the car division increased in 2016. Some were frustrated with the pace of progress and had doubts about new leader John Krafcik, while others wanted to start their own autonomous vehicle companies, people familiar with the matter said. The big payouts exacerbated the situation because team members had less financial incentive to stay, the people familiar with the situation said. Chris Urmson, previous leader of the project, departed in August and is working on a startup. Other early project members left to form Otto, a self-driving trucking company that was quickly snapped up by Uber Technologies Inc. Bryan Salesky, a former Google car executive, started Argo AI, which got a $1 billion investment from Ford Motor Co. on Friday.   Urmson and Salesky didn’t respond to requests for comment. Sebastian Thrun, who started the car project and helped design the pay system, didn’t respond to questions, either. During the early 2016 conference call, Porat suggested a different approach to incentives at Other Bets in the future. "It is about getting more ambitious things done. We’re doing that in a framework to ensure we are disciplined with our resources, and this was just calling out a milestone established some time ago," she said.

Google Maps is coming to the rescue with a brand new feature being rolled out today: shareable lists. Beginning today, you can use the Google Maps app to create lists of your favorite places and share them with family and friends. What’s more, you can also follow the lists that other people create. If you’re planning a trip, this allows you to create a list of places you’d like to visit before you even arrive, keeping you from forgetting an out-of-the-way museum or restaurant when you’re in the midst of your vacation. Beyond that, you can follow lists created by people who live at your destination, giving you insider knowledge on the places worth visiting. Adding locations to lists seems straightforward enough: simply find a location, tap on the name, and then tap the “save” button you see in the pop-up menu. Google has already created a few general purpose lists for you to use, but if you want to get a little more specific, you can create your own. If you want to share the list you’ve created, you’ll need to open the sidebar menu, select “Your places,” and then from there head into the “saved” tab. You’ll see your lists laid out before you, and then it’s simply a matter of selecting the list you want and tapping the “share” button. You’ll be given a link that you can then share with friends via text message, email, or social media. The whole process of creating and sharing lists is outlined in the video you see below. One cool aspect of this new functionality is that you’ll be able to download entire lists for offline viewing. This new feature should be appearing within Google Maps soon, but for what it’s worth, I’m not seeing it just yet on Android. For now, head down to the comments section and let us know if you can create Google Maps lists on your smart device!

The verdict [PDF] was handed down on Friday after a jury trial in Marshall, Texas. The patents – including this one – were awarded to former Lucent engineer Allen Rozman, who died aged 52 in 2012, and Alfonso J. Cioffi, both of Texas*, who filed suit [PDF] against Google in 2013. In December 2014, however, a US District judge, Judge Gilstrap, dismissed the case, after the plaintiffs acknowledged that under the judge’s interpretation of the words “web browser process”, an infringement claim wouldn’t hold up. Cioffi and the Rozman family appealed, and a Federal Court found Gilstrap had erred, both in his interpretation of “web browser process” and over another interpretation. “We see nothing that indicates that Cioffi intended its invention to do anything other than protect ‘critical files’ as that concept is widely understood by those of skill in the art,” the Federal Circuit court wrote. Google then appealed to the US Supreme Court to hear the case, but the Supes declined. Ultimately the patent could yield $60m for the surviving family of the inventor. Google has said it maintains its position that the patents are invalid. ® *The case Cioffi et al. v.

February 13, 2017 11:36 am EST By Ashlee Kieler@akieler sharing is caring google google maps maps social shareable lists locations samification Sure, it might seem social networking giants like Snapchat and Instagram continuously mimic each other in a phenomenon we’re calling “samification,” but now it looks as if a seemingly unrelated app is dipping its toes in the social pool, too: Google is adding a more social, sharable function to its Maps app. Google announced in a blog post Monday that it would expand its starring — or save — option that allowed users to save locations for later use, to include a function that would let users create lists of their favorite places and then share them with friends. The feature, which was previously available to Google Local Guides, allows users to create lists of places, share their lists with others, and follow the lists of friends and family. To use the feature, Map users tap on a location, click the “save” icon, and select a pre-made list. In order to view a list later, users simply go to the Your Places section of the menu and then tap the saved tab. Icons of saved locations will then appear on your Google Map. Users can also share their saved lists with friends and family via email, text, or other apps by clicking on the “share” button associated with the specific list. The lists can also be made public for anyone using Google Maps to see.

This Valentine's Day, fall in love with -- and feel depressed about -- the endangered pangolin. Image: Google By Maria Gallucci2017-02-13 16:23:57 UTC Hop over to Google.com, and you'll see a pair of enamored pangolins prepping for Valentine's Day this week. Press play, and you can help the cute scaly mammals fall in love. Perhaps you'll feel whimsical, or even a little happy. Consider this your dose of cold, hard reality: The pangolin — a nocturnal, cat-sized anteater — is rolling toward extinction.  SEE ALSO: Giant rats could help fight wildlife smuggling in Africa Put another way, pangolins are "literally being eaten out of existence," according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Native to Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa, the termite-eating pangolins are thought to be the most trafficked animals in the world. Their meat is considered a luxury food in many cultures, and their scales are a common ingredient in traditional Asian medicines. Image: Google All eight pangolin species are now threatened with extinction, according to the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Two species in particular are listed as critically endangered. Google launched its first pangolin game on Feb. 11 and will add new levels through Valentine's Day on Feb. 14. Pangolins are the most trafficked mammals in the world. Find out how to help them through today’s Google Doodle! https://t.co/irPpcwxgvM pic.twitter.com/wpm3TjD6cV — WWF (@WWF) February 13, 2017 In the Google game, a red pangolin rolls across the landscape to find its blue partner.  In real life, pangolins do roll up into balls, but they do so in order to protect themselves from predators; their scaly exteriors fight off gnashing fangs.  Pretty cool, right? Well... This ball-rolling move also makes it easier for poachers to snatch pangolins in the wild. Wildlife experts estimate that more than 1 million pangolins have been illegally traded in the past decade, despite national and international efforts to crack down on poaching. But don't despair. Conservationists say there is still time to save the pangolin. A non-profit in Tanzania is turning rats into sniffing sleuths that can detect trafficked animal parts — including pangolin meat and scales — in shipments from Africa to Asia. In October, a treaty involving 180 countries and conservation groups signed an agreement to end all legal trade of pangolins and afford the eight species the top level of protection under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora. Google itself is involved in the effort to spare pangolins from extinction. The tech giant's philanthropic arm, Google.org, recently gave a grant to the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), which is using thermal imagery and other advanced technology to track poachers within pangolin habitats. WWF said Google approached the organization two weeks ago about its plans to feature pangolins for Valentine's Day. The Doodle game directs players to WWF's pangolin "adoption" kits, which aid conservation efforts. "It's a critical time to raise awareness for the pangolin. The outlook for them is bleak," Diane Quigley, WWF's senior director of digital platforms, said in an email.  "We welcome Google's help in raising the visibility of this endangered creatures' plight."

Skip to content MilTech pr@satprnews.com Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 13 February 2017 by Military News How To Use Google Apps to be More Productive and Awesome Recently, Google announced that it is updating its Google Voice App for the first time in five years. I use Google Voice in conjunction with Google Hangouts for calling and texting, and it struck me how integrated into my daily routine this one Google App is (and the update is AWESOME!!!). I also use Google Docs and Drive to collaborate on different projects, and I use Gmail as my primary email address. In my Gmail, I receive many Google Alerts and notifications from Google Plus Communities. I’m not unique. The Google ecosystem has touchpoints in many aspects of our lives, yet there are perhaps some awesome apps or updates that many people aren’t aware of. So, what I’d like to share in this post is some useful features of the Google ecosystem that may make your job as a communications or marketing professional easier. Google Voice Key features: Google Voice is a telephone service that allows you to make and receive phone calls to a unique phone number from an app or desktop (via the Internet rather than using a cellular connection). The service also lets you send and receive text messages from individuals and groups, record and receive (very rough) transcripts of conversations, and receive transcripted voicemail by text or email. It is free to use, with some nominal fees for telephone number changes. How it can help communications and marketing professionals: You may use a Google Voice number for a unique purpose (hotline), use the desktop version to manage bulk texts, take advantage of its integration with Google Contacts to manage text segmentation and delivery. Transcriptions may be useful (they are more accurate after the latest update – in their last iteration they were not exceptionally accurate). You can forward Google Voice through Hangouts and add the capability for video calls. Pro tip: It is illegal to record a telephone conversation without the other party’s consent. Google Hangouts: Key features: Google Hangouts is a mobile and desktop app that allows you to make video calls, create group “Hangouts,” telephone calls, and text messages. Google9to5 reports that Google is trying to differentiate Hangouts from Voice, Allo, and Duo by making it an enterprise app. There is likely a modification coming to this in the future. How it can help communications and marketing professionals: The Hangouts feature is a great tool for certain circumstances, and the video call feature has the utility of Skype with deeper Google integration. Google Contacts Key features: Contacts is a cloud communication and group manager with integration throughout the Google ecosystem (the exception being the mobile Google Hangouts app) and easy synchronization with mobile. You can also integrate contacts with third-party email programs like Outlook and Thunderbird using Google Sync. How it can help communications and marketing professionals: This app is a very easy way to manage contacts in the cloud, but is useful if you use many of Google’s integrated apps. Google Docs Key features: Google Docs is a free, cloud-based suite of Office-like apps: Docs (documents, not to be confused with the overarching “Docs”), Sheets (spreadsheets), Slides (Powerpoint-esque), and Forms. Perhaps one of the easiest collaborative tools out there – Google Docs autosaves every change that you make and allows users to share and collaborate on the same documents quite frictionlessly. Docs and Sheets standalone mobile apps have been recently updated and are (subjectively) superior to Office mobile apps. How it can help communications and marketing professionals: These apps don’t have the wealth of features of the Office suite but are near essential for cloud collaboration. Forms is an easy way to get information (contact info, event registration, feedback) from your email contacts. Google Drive Key features: Google Drive is a cloud-based storage app, integrated for synchronization with Windows and Mac operating systems. It allows for 15 GB of free storage and then charges monthly fees for storage in excess (15GB is cumulative across Drive, Photos, and Gmail). How it can help communications and marketing professionals: Compared to many cloud storage apps, Drive offers a lot more storage for free. Regardless, the biggest benefit may be the integration with the rest of the ecosystem. Especially for collaboration using Google Docs. Google Calendar Key features: Google Calendar is how my wife and I communicate a cloud mobile and desktop calendar app that synchronizes with common third-party apps such as Outlook and iCalendar. How it can help communications and marketing professionals: Google Calendar can be exceptionally helpful when you have to manage calendars across multiple platforms. Outlook for a client and iCalendar for work, for example. You can also manage multiple calendars within in one application, which is also useful. Accelerated Mobile Pages / Google News Key features: Google’s Accelerated Mobile Pages is an HTML-lite language developed by Google for the purpose of making mobile web pages load faster (there is also an asynchronous load and caching component to the process). The Google News carousel is exclusively populated by AMP sites, and as much as 70% of all mobile Google News results are AMP-compliant. How it can help communications and marketing professionals: It’s likely that most web pages will transition to AMP (or at least the mobile redirect) shortly. There isn’t an explicit Google penalty not to, but AMP pages are reported to load many times faster than traditional HTML. Google AdWords Key features: Most people know the Google AdWords promotional product, which has been surprisingly stable for a few years (with minor bells and whistles). Google also has an AdWords Express product that permits Google to manage some of the nuances of your ads. How it can help communications and marketing professionals: Paid promotion on Google and their ad network; competitive and keyword research. Google My Business Key features: Despite that it has gone from standalone to Google Plus product to independent again (and changed names with every iteration), Google My Business continues to be an essential Google service for businesses. Google My Business associates critical information about your business (address, phone number, hours, contact number, reviews) to Google apps such as Maps. How it can help communications and marketing professionals: The information in Google My Business informs everything else in the Google ecosystem (and apps and sites that use Google’s API), so it’s important to manage and update your Google My Business information regularly. Google Maps Key features: Google Maps is a mobile (and desktop) mapping app, with an API that is used in numerous other applications (real estate apps like Zillow for example). But one critical aspect of Maps for businesses is the integration of reviews into Maps (they were formerly integrated into Google Plus). How it can help communications and marketing professionals: People trust online reviews a lot. Referring people to Google Maps for reviews (positive ones, hopefully) can be an important aspect of solidifying a company’s online reputation. Google Maps can help you find the fastest way to get to work, too. YouTube Key features: Obviously YouTube is the premier repository for online videos. YouTube hosts videos, allows for customization, monetization, and third-party embedding. How it can help communications and marketing professionals: For video content (or live broadcasting), YouTube is nearly indispensable. Google Trends Key features: Google Trends gives you a snapshot of current searches on Google by country and topic, with their Explore tool offering filtered searches by time and search criteria. How it can help communications and marketing professionals: Google Trends is one of the many tools that content creators can use to gauge current or past interest about certain topics. Google Analytics / Google Tag Manager Key features: Google Analytics is the standard for basic web analytics, while Google Tag Manager is a more precise tool to fire marketing tags for specific web actions. How it can help communications and marketing professionals: Google Tag Manager can give you a very granular understanding of how customers are interacting with your web and mobile properties, while Google Analytics can give at least a broad-stroke view of how web and mobile properties are being used. Google Webmaster Tools Key features: Google Webmaster Tools are a set of compliance tools that check your site code for errors and improvements, which now include AMP compliance recommendations as well. How it can help communications and marketing professionals: Perhaps not something that most people will have direct involvement with, non-webmasters can still use the analytics tools to check on the health of the site from Google’s perspective. Google Chrome Key features: Google Chrome is Google’s web browser. Its performance relative to Microsoft Edge or Mozilla’s Firefox may be disputable, but its integration with the Google ecosystem is not. Extensions for Hangouts, Phone, Docs, Drive and more are all available to make Google’s apps more accessible to its users in the browser. How it can help communications and marketing professionals: If you’re using many Google Apps, it may be worthwhile to check out Google’s browser extensions and see if they enhance your workflow. Google Home Key features: Google Home is Google’s voice-activated speaker powered by the Google Assistant (Alexa, Cortana, and Siri’s equivalent in Google-land). How it can help communications and marketing professionals: I don’t know if this will help too much, except that it does give you access to the Google ecosystem through Google Calendar, if you’d rather speak appointments than type them. Google Translate Key features: Google Translate is a translation tool that allows you to type a phrase and translate it into many different languages. Google Translate is using machine learning to improve its translations, and its mobile app now translates from images (this feature is called “instant camera”). How it can help communications and marketing professionals: You can use this in a pinch, although a more trusted resource may cause less confusion in the long-term. Google Plus Key features: Google Plus is Google’s itinerant social network. Google tried to integrate many of its essential services into the platform and has since reversed strategy. Key features of the current iteration of Google Plus are Squidoo-ish “Collections” and LinkedIn Group-ish “Communities.” Also, your Google Plus profile is still associated across all of your accounts on the Google ecosystem. How it can help communications and marketing professionals: Google Plus is limited as a social network, but communications and marketing professionals may find Collections or Communities as an attractive place to provide niche content or support, especially given the impressive UI of the platform. Google Photos Key features: One of the stand-out features of Google Plus until it was decoupled, Google Photos allows you to upload a lot of photos, apply filters, make collages and animations, and albums. Like an early iteration of Instagram before it adopted Snapchat’s features. How it can help communications and marketing professionals: For a quick and easy way to access and do minor manipulation of images, this may be helpful particularly if it supports another activity in the Google ecosystem. Google Allo and Duo Key features: Google Allo is a Messenger-like standalone chat app. Google Duo is a Facetime-like standalone video app. How it can help communications and marketing professionals: Google Assistant is integrated into Allo, so you can ask questions as you would to Siri, Alexa, or Cortana. Otherwise, these will only be useful to the extent that the people that you want to communicate with have adopted them. For the immediate future, these will probably only be useful if the people you interact with have adopted them as well. Perhaps more of a one-off from Skype and Messenger than a replacement. Conclusion Of course, this list doesn’t encompass all of the Google ecosystem. Hopefully, this demonstrates that there are many free-to-use resources within the Google ecosystem, many that gain utility as you integrate more apps into your workflow. By creating this integrated system of mobile and desktop apps, Google makes itself indispensable for many people.

Pop any query into the web search engine it developed and it will provide answers to just about anything. Google can even personalize the responses based on user profiles.  Unfortunately, it couldn't provide the same robust capabilities at the enterprise level ... until now, that is.  As of this week Google Cloud Search — known as Springboard in preview — can provide enterprises with an option that uses machine intelligence to search across G Suite, Google’s productivity suite. It can search across all G Suite repositories including Gmail, Calendar, Docs, Drive, Contacts and more. Like the search engine for the web, it also offers information and recommendations based on an analysis of previous searches. The general release of Cloud Search tackles an increasingly complex enterprise problem, particularly in large enterprises that are using cloud-based and on-premises applications. Teams working in these enterprises are forced to work in hybrid environments and store immense amounts of data in dozens of repositories and in various formats from emails and docs to spreadsheets, slides, forms, internal sites, and more. But how do you find that data once it has been stored? The new Cloud Search offers a way of sifting through all this data where it is located and providing relevant results.  Cloud Search also respects G Suite’s file sharing permissions, so people can only search for and find files to which they have access. So everyone can find general company resources, but team projects will only surface to people within the appropriate teams concerned. Personal to-do lists will only be available to the person that owns the list. Cloud Search does what many enterprise content management systems vendors have been trying to build for years: provide an effective way to pull down the walls of repositories. Some vendors have already managed to do that — Dallas-based M Files, with its metadata-based search, springs to mind here. But generally speaking, it has been a complex and costly process. Google is will begin rolling out Cloud Search globally for customers using the G Suite Business and Enterprise editions. It expects Cloud Search will ultimately  integrate it with third-party solutions. Quip, a Salesforce Company, Gets an Upgrade San Francisco-based Quip is making its documents smarter with project management, a new design, and deeper integrations with Salesforce, which acquired the company last year. The update pulls Quip deeper into Salesforce with new document creation and management features.  Quip documents now offer a projects to-do list and built-in reminder dates that can correspond to an overall project or review of one piece of a project. Quip has also been redesigned to help users find, contribute to and execute on collaborative projects. Next Monday, Quip Connect will be available in Salesforce AppExchange, giving teams new ways to work with Quip and Salesforce. With Quip Connect, users will be able to export reports to Quip documents and spreadsheets with Live Data. Users will also be able to access CRM data in Quip with information that is always up to date as changes in Live Data will be synchronized with data in Salesforce. It will also have a Quip component for Salesforce where users can link, access, and create Quip content right inside Salesforce. Salesforce has big plans for Quip. At Dreamforce it shared its vision for the platform, which it acquired in August for $582 million. Widen Releases Workflow Madison, Wis.-based, Widen Enterprises released Workflow, an online proofing and work management solution. It is part of Widen Collective version 11, Widen’s digital asset management (DAM) system. Workflow is a central, automated tool that enables teams to plan, request, schedule, route, proof and measure project work as well as collaborate in one place throughout the lifecycle of a project. The company claimed in a statement that Workflow is like an extra team member who handles tedious organizational tasks so workers can focus on collaboration and quality work. “Producing quality content is a complicated endeavor. We want to capture more of the creative lifecycle in our technology so that users can execute at their highest potential,” Widen CEO Matthew Gonnering said. Plustek Offers Scanning For SharePoint Taipei-based Plustek, a document scanning vendor, released a SharePoint-specific document scanner, the Plustek eScan SharePoint. Built on its eScan network standalone scanning kiosk, the SharePoint version allows users to scan paper documents directly into SharePoint Online and on-premises, Microsoft Office 365 and network folders through a seven-inch touchscreen. There is no PC required. The scanner enables users to convert paper documents and save them directly into their designated folder or library, complete with metadata. This greatly reduces the usual document management scanning workload of having to scan to a PC, rename, add metadata and transfer the file in four separate steps.  0 Comments Top Articles Related Articles Recent Comments Microsoft Integrates Power BI in SharePoint Online Forrester Analyst: PaaS a ‘Revolution’ for Web Content Management AI-Fueled Storytelling Takes Customer Experience to the Next Level How Machine Learning Uncovers Hidden Correlations for Marketers When 'Good Enough' Analytics Is More Than Good Enough SpringCM Raises $25M, Names a New CEO Google Search Now Extends Across Enterprise Repositories Microsoft Slowly Releases Focused Inbox Email Sorting Feature, More News Workers Still Need Printers in Paperless Offices Don't Be Stupid With Your Gmail, More News Useful Article?

If you've made your way on to the interwebs today, you may already know that Google is marking Valentine's Day the best way it knows how – by launching a fun interactive doodle. Navigate inevitably to Google's homepage and you'll see a magenta coloured heart with a 'play' symbol in the middle of it, just above the search field. This is where your time-wasting journey begins. What is a pangolin? There's also a couple of cutely illustrated pangolins loitering on either side of the throbbing organ – the little-known critters are often described as 'scaly anteaters' and are native to Asia and Africa. Hit the play button and you'll be guided through a walkthrough level, which will teach you the game's controls. Your left and right arrow keys allow you to move backwards and fowards, respectively, while hitting space bar (or tapping your up key; or clicking the big 'up' arrow in the bottom right-hand corner) let you jump in the air and avoid obstacles. You'll then get to play the game proper, and it's one of the toughest Google doodles to date. Your mission is to collect cocoa beans to help you bake a cake for your would-be Valentine – the basic mechanism reminds of one Mr Sonic the Hedgehog and his fondness of obtaining gold rings. Reach 150 cocoa beans within the allotted time (three minutes for level one) and you're through to the next stage, presumably, but we haven't made it that far. You can also play it on your mobile device. The game isn't just about getting you through to home-time, though; it's actually a joint effort between Google and the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) designed to raise awareness of the paologin, which is the most poached and trafficked animal the world, according to the WWF. What will the next Google doodle game be? Bookmark this page for all the latest updates. Related: MWC 2017 WATCH: Game of the Year 2016 How many cocoa beans have you managed to collect?

Are they and the new features enough to make things interesting?  The most important news is that we have two new watches after months of nothing: The first watches with Android Wear 2.0 are the LG Watch Style and LG Watch Sport—both designed in collaboration with Google. The Style sells for $249 but it is just a standard watch with WiFi and Bluetooth.   If you want GPS, heart rate, NFC for payments, i.e. a full function watch that can work as a fitness/sports tracker, then you will need to find $379, although you can get it cheaper on a contract with a phone provider. If you share my opinion that the biggest market for smart watches is the fitness tracker then the LG Watch Sports is the more attractive. It is still unclear if this is a big enough market with sufficiently diverse needs to support a healthy developer community as well as healthy users. The question is are there any discoverable "killer" apps once the basic fitness tracking functions have been included.  Google Fit, the pre-installed fitness app on most Android Wear watches, now lets you track your pace, distance, calories burned and heart rate* as you’re walking, running or cycling. You can also measure weight-lifting reps, in addition to push-ups, sit-ups and squats. When you work out with a cellular-connected Android Wear watch, you can stay in touch with calls and messages, stream tunes from Google Play Music and still use your favorite apps right on your watch. Google is making a lot of the range of watch faces that are available to users and is keen on promoting apps like ordering an Uber ride or checking you phone. It is also emphasising the standalone abilities of the watch. If you have a celular connection then you can message and you can download apps from the new on watch app store. AI has a lot to offer as well: When you receive a message, you can expand the notification and tap to respond by dictating, typing or handwriting your answer, or drawing an emoji.  Can voice input work for a watch? There is a huge difference between yelling at Alexa or Google Home in the privacy of your own house, but when you get outside the same behavior will probably result in an arrest for disturbing the peace. The same is probably true of the other big AI hope: Android Wear 2.0 brings the Google Assistant to your wrist, so you can find answers and get things done—hands free. Ask your Google Assistant about the weather or remind yourself to bring an umbrella. Make a restaurant reservation or navigate to work. You can even update your shopping list right from your wrist. To ask for help, just hold down the power button on your watch or say “Ok Google." I can already hear trainloads of people saying "Ok Google".  At least users have to hold the power button for it to be effective which reduces the chance that some stranger is going to book you a table for two. Chatting to your watch probably isn't going to catch on. Indeed, one of the problems that the whole smart watch industry suffers from is that, despite a long history of wrist communicators being the promise of the future, talking to your wrist in a public place just isn't cool.  The upgrade should also be available for some existing watches in the near future and the LG watches will trickle out to the rest of the world in time.   More Information Android Wear 2.0: Make the most of every minute Related Articles Android Wear 2.0 To Launch In February  Pebble Taken Over By FitBit - Developers & Users Abandoned  Google Fit SDK Preview  Android Comes To Wearables And Watches    To be informed about new articles on I Programmer, sign up for our weekly newsletter, subscribe to the RSS feed and follow us on, Twitter, Facebook, Google+ or Linkedin.  Bjarne Stroustrup Thinks He Has A Better Way To Do Generics 01/02/2017 Bjarne Stroustrup is, of course, the inventor of C++.

 Google's Pixel can now control your smart home BI Intelligence Feb. 13, 2017, 10:45 AM 2,945 facebook linkedin twitter email print BI Intelligence See Also Google Home makes a play for mass appeal with Super Bowl ads Two tech companies have launched a network to connect low-power IoT devices THE INTERNET OF THINGS 2017 REPORT: How the IoT is improving lives to transform the world This story was delivered to BI Intelligence IoT Briefing subscribers. To learn more and subscribe, please click here. In a bid to expand the reach and use of voice control in the smart home, Google has updated the smartphone version of its Google Assistant to allow it to directly control smart home devices, reports The Verge. This move, which brings features previously reserved for the company’s Google Home speaker hub to the Pixel line of phones, sheds light on Google’s larger home and voice strategies.  Companies fostering smart home ecosystems have followed one of two models so far: Hub-based ecosystems: Exemplified by Amazon, the ecosystem revolves around a connected hub like the Echo, which consumers use for convenience functions like basic search or music, as well as to control smart home devices. Amazon also uses the Echo to drive customers to its core e-commerce business. Device-based ecosystems: A notable example of this kind of ecosystem is Apple’s home offerings. This type of ecosystem may use a hub — Apple requires an Apple TV or iPad to handle that role — but a smartphone or tablet for interactions with smart home devices. This interaction can use voice or touch-based commands. Google’s initial moves placed it in the hub-based category, but by migrating its features to mobile, the company's smart home ecosystem will straddle the line between the two models. Allowing Pixel phones, and eventually other devices with Google Assistant, to control smart home devices, will enable wider availability and lower entry costs, boosting the number of consumers who are able to dive into Google’s smart home ecosystem. This move may cut into potential sales of the Google Home speaker hub, but the company's willingness to take that risk points to its overall smart home strategy. Google’s goal is not like Apple’s, which is to drive hardware sales, or Amazon’s, which is to facilitate e-commerce. Rather, Google’s interest is in driving the use of search, gathering data, and serving ads. Hardware sales can facilitate that, as can software updates to existing devices. Google will potentially be able to leverage the tens of millions of devices running Android software to control the smart home, driving growth in the segment while also pushing the company’s primary business. The U.S. smart home market has yet to truly take off. At its current state, we believe the smart home market is stuck in the 'chasm' of the technology adoption curve, in which it is struggling to surpass the early-adopter phase and move to the mass-market phase of adoption. There are many barriers preventing mass-market smart home adoption: high device prices, limited consumer demand and long device replacement cycles. However, the largest barrier is the technological fragmentation of the smart home ecosystem, in which consumers need multiple networking devices, apps and more to build and run their smart home. BI Intelligence, Business Insider's premium research service, has compiled a detailed report on the U.S. smart home market that analyzes current consumer demand for the smart home and barriers to widespread adoption. It also analyzes and determines areas of growth and ways to overcome barriers. Here are some key takeaways from the report: Smart home devices are becoming more prevalent throughout the US. We define a smart home device as any stand-alone object found in the home that is connected to the internet, can be either monitored or controlled from a remote location, and has a noncomputing primary function. Multiple smart home devices within a single home form the basis of a smart home ecosystem. Currently, the US smart home market as a whole is in the "chasm" of the tech adoption curve. The chasm is the crucial stage between the early-adopter phase and the mass-market phase, in which manufacturers need to prove a need for their devices. High prices, coupled with limited consumer demand and long device replacement cycles, are three of the four top barriers preventing the smart home market from moving from the early-adopter stage to the mass-market stage. For example, mass-market consumers will likely wait until their device is broken to replace it. Then they will compare a nonconnected and connected product to see if the benefits make up for the price differential. The largest barrier is technological fragmentation within the connected home ecosystem. Currently, there are many networks, standards, and devices being used to connect the smart home, creating interoperability problems and making it confusing for the consumer to set up and control multiple devices. Until interoperability is solved, consumers will have difficulty choosing smart home devices and systems. "Closed ecosystems" are the short-term solution to technological fragmentation. Closed ecosystems are composed of devices that are compatible with each other and which can be controlled through a single point.

Google Doodle's Valentine's Day Game Features Endangered Animal By Juliana Rose Pignataro @julie_pignataro On 02/13/17 AT 10:26 AM Close The team of illustrators at Google took the opportunity to use Valentine's Day as a way to raise awareness for one of the world’s most endangered, and little known, creatures. The pangolin, a mammal covered in scales, was featured in Monday’s Google Doodle. Also known as “scaly anteaters,” pangolins are the most trafficked mammal in the entire world. The creatures have been hunted for food and used in traditional medicine, while their scaly skins were coveted as fashion accessories. In traditional medicine, the scales get dried and roasted as treatment for nervousness and palsy. The rampant illegal trade combined with a rapid loss of habitat has led to the eight species of pangolin becoming critically endangered. Most of the illegal trade originated in Cameroon, Nigeria and Ghana. Native to Asia and Africa, pangolins eat ants and termites using long, sticky tongues and are capable of rolling themselves into a ball when threatened. Though it was unclear how long they can live in the wild, pangolins have been known to live up to 20 years in captivity. A pangolin skin is displayed alongside other illegal animal parts at a stall in Mong La, Myanmar, Feb. 17, 2016. Photo: Getty Related Stories Rusty Patched Bumblebee Declared Endangered Over 180 Nations Approve Ban On Pangolin Trade Google aimed to increase inadequate public and governmental awareness regarding the species with its Doodle Monday featuring a giant pangolin on a search for love. Reported seizures of illegally hunted pangolins between 2011 and 2013 showed that as many as 234,000 pangolins were killed. But that number likely only represents 10 percent of the actual volume of pangolins being traded illegally, according to the World Wildlife Fund.  In 2016, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species upgraded pangolins to appendix one of endangered species in order to ensure they would be given the strictest protection possible. More than 180 governments came together to sign an agreement to end legal trade of pangolins and increase penalties on those found to have trafficked in the animal.   Join the Discussion Most Read Everything You Need To Know, Right Now.

Published on February 13, 2017. Most Popular Proximity marketing has huge potential but has yet to find its stride. But that may be about to change, thanks to the world's most popular mobile browser. In the latest version of Chrome for iOS, Google is testing a feature that gives brick-and-mortar retailers a simple, inexpensive and direct connection to nearby shoppers' smartphones. Shoppers using this version of Chrome who tap into the search bar, which Google calls the "OmniBox," will discover content on the "Physical Web," an open source project to allow interaction with smart devices. As it is, the test feature is hidden behind flags in Chrome that are typically found by software developers, hard-core search marketers and extreme tech hobbyists. But if the Physical Web is added to the OmniBox for every Chrome user, IT would make Physical Web content an integral part of everyday search. In effect, Google would be saying, "I know you want to search for something, so just in case what you seek is in your immediate environment, here is what's nearby. If not, go ahead and type your search term without interruption." The Physical Web uses digital "touchpoints," typically Bluetooth beacons that broadcast a website URL. These touchpoints are then associated with things and places in the physical world, where smartphones can discover them. Better than beacons Beacons have been tried before in brick-and-mortar retail, but they never took off with Apple's predominant iBeacon protocol. Dozens of retailers -- including Macy's, Rite Aid, Target and Walgreens -- deployed thousands of beacons. But each retailer required their own app for shoppers to download. That's a lot of apps. Moreover, the technology tracked people and pushed messages based upon metrics like visit frequency or dwell time. No matter how many times marketers say "we are going to send you just the right message at just the right time," background tracking and push messages will always feel creepy to many consumers. On the other hand, if the Physical Web is adopted into Chrome, the browser would be all anyone would need. With more than a billion users each month on both Android and iOS, Chrome represents the world's largest mobile browsing audience. It's growing at more than double the rate of the No. 2 browser, APPLE's Safari. (AS of January 2017, Chrome had a 53.15% share of the mobile browser market, Safari came in at 32.44% and third place, held by Android browser, is not even close at 6.58%.) Imagine shoppers who touch the OmniBox immediately seeing search results for nearby beacons. In effect, they would have direct access to content, information and digital interactions most relevant to their context. This could include live chat support, product videos or reviews, coupons, in-store promotions and more. No need to download any other apps; no background tracking or push messages. Physical Web touchpoints are discovered using a tried-and-true search tool, except with results based on proximity rather than on search term. A boon for retailers For brick-and-mortar retailers, every in-store shopper holding a smartphone is a great opportunity -- or a lost one. If your in-store customers are using their smartphones for research, there's a good chance they're looking at Amazon or another competitor. Think about that: your competitors having your customer's attention while they are in your store. If Physical Web search results receive the premium ranking of being the first content seen, then these marketing rights should go the owner of the physical location where the beacons are placed. Taking advantage of these rights is a no-brainer. It is important, however, for content displayed on the Physical Web to be something shoppers will value. Just like in searching the web, if the results aren't interesting, they will be ignored. The mobile engagement question has stumped retailers for years, especially regarding shoppers who are physically present during micro-moments, when their intent to learn or buy something is high. Maybe Google has found the answer: Just let shoppers tell us what they want with their search selections. After all, this approach works for the rest of the web. Keep an eye on Chrome. You can bet your competition will. In this article: DigitalNext Retail Search Shopper Marketing Richard Graves Richard Graves is CEO of BKON Connect.

That reality has been upsetting to some. In a Saturday column titled “Anti-Consumer Agenda at the FCC,” the New York Times’ editorial board attacked Pai for his opposition to opening the cable box market to edge providers such as Google, Facebook, Amazon netopolies, and Netflix, the Internet’s top bandwidth hog. ADVERTISEMENT The sad reality is that the previous FCC did the bidding of the biggest edge providers, both on the issue of net neutrality and opening up the cable box market, as I will explain.   The FCC justified retrograde Title II net neutrality regulations to prevent broadband providers from creating Internet “fast and slow lanes” for edge providers via a rule called “no paid prioritization.” Translation: the FCC fixed a permanent price of zero for all downstream traffic flowing from edge providers, which means the previous FCC forced consumers to subsidize the outsized bandwidth usage costs of the most profitable companies in America.  If the FCC’s Title II net neutrality regulation really was pro-consumer, why are edge providers exempt from paying for the extra costs of their outsized bandwidth usage, when the FCC expects consumers to pay for their bandwidth usage? Why is it unacceptable for edge providers to pay more for a “fast lane,” when consumers routinely have the choice to pay more for a faster Internet access speed if they want to? How can the previous FCC claim its Title II net neutrality policy is pro-consumer, when the previous FCC issued a net neutrality enforcement reporting that opposed free data usage for consumers on the basis of Title II? You can’t make this stuff up. The previous FCC believed that allowing edge providers the voluntary opportunity, and competitive freedom, to compete for consumers’ business by sponsoring or paying for a consumer’s data usage was not “neutral,” and therefore not good for consumers. To be pro-consumer, the FCC’s net neutrality policy would help and protect consumers, not effectively force consumers to pay more to subsidize Google, Facebook, Amazon, and Netflix’ bandwidth when Title II subsidy policies historically always ensured businesses subsidized consumers, not the other way around. The other regulation the New York Times falsely touted as pro-consumer, the FCC’s set-top-box proceeding, was perversely anti-consumer as well in looking out only for the interests of Google, Facebook, and Amazon, and not for the interests of consumers. In claiming that it wanted consumers to have competitive alternatives to existing cable set-top boxes by mandating that Pay TV providers had to make their proprietary video streams and associated guide information available to Google, Facebook, Amazon, etc., for free – the previous FCC threatened the ongoing viability of a vibrantly competitive industry that serves consumers well and consequently produces $200b in annual revenues. If the previous FCC were truly looking out for consumers’ interests first, and not Google, Facebook and Amazon’s interests first, the previous FCC would have accepted the Pay TV industry’s counterproposal of offering consumers a free and secure, modern app that could totally replace the 1970s technology of a set-top box, and save consumers billions of dollars a year. The edge providers pressured the previous FCC to reject the secure app proposal because they wanted to use and monetize their competitors’ copyright-licensed content for free, and a secure app replacement of a set-top box would only be free to the consumer who pays for the service, and not free to edge providers unwilling to pay a market price for the commercial use of the proprietary content. In sum, the previous FCC did net neutrality a disservice. Net neutrality began as a bipartisan, unanimous FCC policy statement in 2005 that ensured consumers could competitively access and use the legal content, apps, and devices of their choice, subject to reasonable network management. In 2009, net neutrality ceased being about consumers, and all about edge providers, when Professor Wu, the one who coined the term “net neutrality,” redefined it to become about consumers economically subsidizing edge providers. By replacing Title II net neutrality price regulation with free market competition that naturally puts customers in charge, Chairman Pai can reverse mistakes made during the Obama administration, and bring a truly pro-consumer focus back to his agency. Scott Cleland served as deputy U.S. coordinator for international communications and information policy in the George H. W. Bush administration. He is president of Precursor LLC, an internetization consultancy for Fortune 500 companies, and chairman of NetCompetition, a pro-competition e-forum supported by broadband interests.

Linee played 112 games for Western Province between 1992 and 2001. He was never capped as a Springbok, but played 9 matches in the ‘Dirt Tracker’ team. He died at the age of 45 and was suffering from Motor Neuron Disease (MND).  The contrast between Linee’s life, illness and passing and that of Joost van der Westhuizen could not be starker. The difference in the responses to the two could be attributed to a number of factors, including the epic 1995 Rugby World Cup final, an event in which Joost played no small part. Joost also enjoyed considerable success after the 1995 Rugby World Cup, serving for a while as captain of the Springboks and boasting an 80% winning record for the 10 matches he served as leader, while earning 89 full test caps during his career.  Joost was by all accounts an exceptional talent, and he should be recognised as such.   Tinus Linee was no less of a talent and he was a fearsome tackler. I have no knowledge of his early years before rugby, nor do I know much of his life after rugby, save for what I gathered through social media and the omnipresent Google search engine.  Using Google, I conducted a search engine experiment, which should not be tried by those who are squeamish, sensitive, alcoholics or compulsive shoppers. I searched for “Tinus Linee” and Google served up 26,000 hits. It led me to his funeral service which was on YouTube. The video has been watched 583 times since it was uploaded on 10 November 2013.  I conducted the same search for Joost van der Westhuizen and Google served up 932 000 hits! It also led me to his memorial service, which was held on Friday, and despite still being screened and referenced on every local television channel, it had rocketed from 870 views when I first checked, to 8 324 views during the course of writing this piece.  This made me think of Jack Dolomba, who was described as an ‘African Springbok’, despite never having had the opportunity of turning out for the ‘national’ team. Dolomba passed away in August 2014, and the Supersport report said: “Dolomba, who was employed at Buffalo City Municipality at the time of his death, is survived by his wife, daughter, 2 grandchildren and a great grandchild.” The report does not expand on the nature of his employment as a former ‘African Springbok’, because it would reveal too much about the nature of South African society.  Dolomba, at the time of his death, was a municipal street sweeper. He received some Google ‘play’, maybe because he played under the banner of the collaborationist SAARB, which was recognised as a body by Danie Craven’s SARB. Simon Sokuta, who played for KWARU and SARU, also passed away in 2014, but Google kept on asking me: “Did you mean: Simon South; Simon Socket; Simon Sahota; Simon Serota…?” I googled many other names and I was not surprised, but angered and dismayed at what I did not find. I found no Freddie Fredericks, no Jan Rooiland, no Tommy Musson… Yes, it is up to those of us who knew these legends to write their histories, but it is difficult when you have to plough your own money into the projects, while holding down a 09:00 to 17:00 job. The benevolence of those who contribute to sports project, only extend to ‘patriotic’ prose, and to those who are committed to what THEY deem to be of benefit to the ‘Nation Building’ process. Zebra Press, Jonathan Ball Publishing, Paarl Media et al. have published countless books on the fantastic contribution that sports have made to the ‘New South Africa’ as if by publishing these fantasies, they will conjure them into reality.  I remember a while back, I cracked a remark about the personal appearance of Bryan Habana and a very good friend admonished me for the remark. Out of respect for him, I removed the post, yet he was unrelenting and sent me a screenshot of the post. It was in that same week that I was watching Trevor Noah on TV, when he was making fun of Jacob Zuma’s head – or the shape of his head. It then occurred to me that had I been in a position of power then the response to my post might have been different.  This, in essence, is the defining spirit of the ‘new’ South Africa – recognition of, and subservience to power. It is fine for a comedian (and I am not a comedian) to make fun of the president of South Africa – like him or not – but you dare not poke fun at the ‘physical infirmities’ of a Springbok!  The jokes that were made at the expense of Caster Semenya points to one significantly fundamental truth about South African power dynamics – they have not changed post-1994. They have remained the same. They are the power dynamics that fuel the fear and hatred that drives Steve Hofmeyr to believe that there’s a culling of ‘white’ South Africans underway.  Maybe the cull forms part of the 94 murders at the hands of the state’s health apparatus? Or maybe the ‘white cull’ was behind the Marikana massacre in 2012? Or maybe this ‘white’ genocide is taking place, as we speak on the Cape Flats where gang violence rages unabated and furiously? Who knows, in a non-racial society, we hardly know the colours of the victims of violent crime anymore. The chaos in Parliament at SONA 2017 has been superseded by the memorial service of Joost van der Westhuizen. It is as if South Africans honestly believe that sport has healed this country, or in some vague way contributed to social cohesion and unity.  It hasn’t. It has shown up the disparities in the system, and we are too fixated by the spectacle of sport to realise that the only way sport can engender social cohesion and healing, is by people interacting with each other in competition.  But that’s not us.  That’s not South African.  We are the errant, petulant children of a flawed negotiation process, a settlement that rewarded us with a tournament which delivered in terms of the scripted fairytale, but not in terms of reality, and what was actually required to build a unitary South Africa.  The ANC usurped all struggle structure at grassroots level through the UDF, and it was always in their design to crush all dissent in this country, and to do so under the spyglass of “The Best Constitution in the World”. It was indeed right and noble of Bill Beaumont to fly down for Van der Westhuizen’s funeral, as he is the current top man in World Rugby. But we should also not forget that he flew down in the 1970’s with the British Lions in support of apartheid sport.  If Mandela built peace and unity, and if the 1995 Springboks contributed to that peace, then we should be mature enough to acknowledge that they were failures in that respect. The country is in a crisis, and no amount of flag waving, anthem singing, or Springbok jersey wearing on Fridays will arrest the crisis, because we are expecting some divine miracle to descend, while we watch sport on TV – if we can afford DSTV, that is.   The ANC cannot build unity, and neither for that matter can the DA or EFF. Only South Africans can. South Africans who are mature enough to acknowledge that we have been sold a fantasy, and that we should by now have outgrown fantasies should realise that it’s time to move on to reality. We can only build unity if we treat each other as equals, regardless of whether we live in Camps Bay or Gugulethu. We should be testimonies to our commitment to fixing this country, and not play or dance to the tune of selective patriotism and selective memory – the type of memory that only sees victors at the Battle of Blood River, and no victims. The same type of memory that sees only victors at Cassinga, not recognising the possibility that there might have been victims. The type of memory that sees only the triumph of the 1995 Rugby World Cup, but ignore the over 27 000 murders that occurred that year.  If anything, sport, and in this case specifically rugby, has shown us that even in death we treat each other differently. It is no different when we are alive. South Africa needs comprehensive collective memory and acknowledgement of the pain of the other - not merely acknowledgement that the other is different. - Mark Fredericks is a video technician at the journalism department at the Walter Sisulu University in East London and writes in his private capacity.  Disclaimer: News24 encourages freedom of speech and the expression of diverse views.

Juan Garzón / CNET Wearable Tech by Scott Stein February 13, 2017 6:27 AM PST @jetscott There's an old football saying: When you have two starting quarterbacks, you have none. I've watched the New York Jets go through a lot of seasons with a lot of quarterbacks on the roster, but no single hero. I just spent a week with Google's new Android Wear 2.0 software update on two different watches, and I feel like Android Wear is in the same boat. There are a lot of Android Wear watches to choose from, and many of them will get updates to Android Wear 2.0. The problem is, there is no flagship Android watch. Sure, there are plenty of Android phones. But from 2010 to 2015, Google had delivered a Nexus phone -- in 2016 it released its first wholly designed-phone, the Pixel -- to demonstrate every year what it feels is the ideal Android experience. The Pixel phones took things a step further with a fantastic polished design. They're part of a new wave of Google products designed, engineered and branded by Google, including the Google Home and Chromecasts. But Android Wear still feels outside that loop. 33 LG Watch Sport pushes the limits of Android Wear 2.0 LG's newest Android Wear watches are designed along with Google's input. They're collaborative products, to a degree. But the LG Watch Sport and LG Watch Style aren't quite hero Android Wear smartwatches. Google won't confirm whether a Pixel watch is in the works, but it doesn't take a soothsayer to read the tea leaves. Former Motorola head Rick Osterloh now leads Google's hardware team, and that team's intention is to build products. It's hard enough to recommend smartwatches right now, but having one singular model to point to helps. Microsoft took that approach with its Surface laptops. Apple has one basic design for the Apple Watch, and most models perform the same tasks. Samsung honed its smartwatch vision to one Gear S2 design with variations on its theme. Google has many, many Android Wear smartwatches made by many companies. Some have Android Pay. Some track your heart rate. Some have built-in GPS. Some have Dick Tracy-esque speakerphones. Some can access the internet even if not synced to a phone. Different models have different buttons and crowns, which means there's no uniform way of using them. Google's Android Wear 2.0 is here, starting with LG Watch Style and Sport Updated watch software transforms Google's Android Wear, and LG's newest smartwatches let us try it out. by Scott Stein 2:37 Close Drag LG's Style and Sport are the newest watches to work with Android Wear, but I wouldn't wear either one. The Style goes for thin design over battery life, Android Pay and GPS functions. The Sport adds GPS and even a stand-alone LTE-connected phone, but at a size and design I wouldn't want. The Android Wear watch I'd prefer would be something between these two. Maybe that exists in previous watch models such as the Huawei Watch, but finding the perfect fit isn't easy. A Pixel watch could consolidate features and show off the core functions together in a tight design. Android Pay, absolutely. Hopefully, no serious compromise on battery. A new, spinning side crown button, like LG's models. Optional GPS. But most importantly, keep the design compact. The Apple Watch's design success is that most models function nearly identically, and they're all relatively small -- they don't look too weird on anyone. A Pixel watch could combine essential features. Understanding the minute differences in Android Wear watches gets tiring, and stores don't necessarily stock all models. Right now, Android Wear's software is getting better. There are still more Apple Watches sold than Android Wear watches, despite all the companies making them. Maybe Google should focus on fewer, better watches. Or just one amazing Pixel watch. It worked for phones and for the Home. Watches could use the love, too, and it might help Google to pinpoint where Android Wear goes next.

How To Make The Most Of Valentine’s Day With Android For Couples Sony’s Latest 4K TV’s Bring Google Assistant to the Big Screen February 13, 2017 - Written By Alexander Maxham While NVIDIA did announce the SHIELD TV at CES last month with Google Assistant support, Sony is the first to bring it to the TV natively. Which is actually a big task, for both NVIDIA and Sony, seeing as the Google Assistant was mostly a voice assistant before this, and the two companies had to work with Google to make Assistant ready for the big screen. Sony has announced a slew of new TV’s, updating their existing 4K TV lineup with new models, and they are available for pre-sale at Best Buy now, and will land at other retailers beginning in March. As you’d expect from any TV coming out in 2017, these do also have HDR support. So you’ll be seeing some very rich and brilliant looking colors on these TV’s from Sony. The company notes that their XBR-X930E and X940E both use their 4K HDR Processor X1 Extreme, which is an advanced image engine and is here to improve the color accuracy of the content on the TV, but also the contrast and clarity. It does also support HDR10, HLG and Dolby Vision. Making for a great experience in your home theater. Sony was one of the first with Android TV built into TV’s, and that trend is continuing here. All of these TV’s have Android TV built in. Allowing you to watch content from your favorite apps like FandangoNOW, VUDU, Netflix, Hulu, Google Play Movies & TV and much more. With it having Android TV support, it does also provide you the ability to watch live TV through PlayStation Vue and Sling TV (DIRECTV NOW only supports Amazon’s Fire TV platform, Chromecast on Android and the Apple TV right now). It won’t be as great of an experience as you would get out of a set-top box with Android TV, but it is an easier way of watching your favorite 4K HDR movies and TV shows on your new TV. Pricing on Sony’s new TV’s are not cheap, with the XBR-43X800E coming in at the cheapest with a price of $999. Ranging all the way up the XBR-75X940E which is a 75-inch TV with a price of $7,499. There are plenty of models to choose from, and each of them have Android TV, Google Assistant and HDR support, so they are all great models to pick up. They will be available in March, Sony has not yet mentioned a specific date in March when you’ll be able to pick one up however.

Is a pangolin real? How do I play the Google game? What is a Chinese Pangolin? What is pangolin love? How do I play the Google Doodle game? Everything you need to know about a pangolin which definitely isn't a dinosaur  Share ByMatthew Cooper 16:29, 13 FEB 2017 Updated17:06, 13 FEB 2017 News (Photo: Google)  Share Get daily updates directly to your inbox + Subscribe Thank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email To celebrate Valentine's Day 2016, Google have created a pretty in-depth browser game about a Pangolin. The American tech company has a history of messing about with its recognisable logo to bring attention to which day of the year it is or if it's a famous person’s birthday etc. Quirkily titled Google Doodles they’re now an integral part of the search engine’s home page. Its latest effort is a game to raise awareness of the endangered Chinese Pangolin which looks somewhere in between dragon/ dinosaur/ pokemon. The eight species of pangolin that roam the wilds of Asia and Africa are strong swimmers who rely on their long tongues and heightened sense of smell to find nourishment. What is a pangolin? The pangolin is the planet's only scaly mammal and truly looks like no other animal and as such pangolins are the most trafficked mammal in the world, and all 8 species face a significant threat from poachers and smugglers. Some estimates now claim that sales of the scaly mammal now account for up to 20 per cent of the entire wildlife black market. Pangolin means ‘something that rolls up’ and it does roll up, much in the same way that Sonic The Hedgehog does. In fact the Google Doodle is very similar to everybody’s favourite blue side scrolling 90s icon. When a pangolin rolls into a ball its keratin scales are often too hard for even a lion to bite through. (Photo: APWG/ZSL/PA Wire) Read More Want to do your Valentine's Day meal on the cheap? Poundland is offering a three-course meal for £7 Where are pangolins from? Out of the eight species of pangolin, four are Asian: Chinese, Indian, Malayan and Palawan. The other four are African: Tree pangolin, Giant ground pangolin, Cape pangolin and Long-tailed pangolin. How do I play pangolin? Now you’re talking, none of this Geography and Biology nonsense when there’s desktop time-killing to be done. To play Pangolin all you have to do is: Visit Google’s desktop website or alternative Google Doodles . Click the Google Doodle (pictured below) Then simply follow the instructions, it’s incredibly simple to play. Not at a laptop? You can play it on Google’s mobile site too. (Photo: Google) The game took over a year to develop and was put together by a six-person team of animators and engineers so it’d be rude if you didn’t waste some of your day collecting cocoa beans (that’s the aim of the game, it’s all pretty vague.)

By Lucas Shaw. Added by Agency Staff on 13 February 2017. Saved under Top, World Tags: David Israelite, Facebook, Spotify, YouTube Tweet A parade of up-and-coming musicians from Universal Music took the stage at the Ace Hotel in downtown Los Angeles in California on Saturday in a pre-Grammy Awards performance for a room full of the executives who will make or break their careers. Talent bookers from James Corden’s late-night show, marketing executives from top brands and executives from Spotify and YouTube looked on. Sandwiched in between tables for Apple, an imposing player in online music, and Pandora Media, owner of the world’s largest online radio service, sat executives from a new act trying to break onto the scene: Facebook. The world’s largest social network has redoubled its efforts to reach a broad accord with the industry, according to interviews with negotiators at labels, music publishers and trade associations. A deal would govern user-generated videos that include songs and potentially pave the way for Facebook to obtain more professional videos from the labels themselves. “We’re hopeful that they are moving towards licensing music for the entire site,” said David Israelite, president of the National Music Publishers Association, an industry trade group. Facebook’s interest in music rights is inextricably linked to its growing interest in video. Having siphoned ads away from print, online companies have recently targeted TV, which attracts about US$70bn in advertising a year. While Facebook faces competition from Twitter and Snapchat, its main rival is Google, and music is one of the most popular types of videos on Google’s YouTube service. Facebook declined to make an executive available for an interview. Licensing music to Facebook would have huge ramifications for the music industry, which is fighting to grab a larger share of the money from online services. With nearly two billion users and a growing advertising business, Facebook could provide billions in new sales for the music industry. Beyond the revenue gains, the music industry could use a deal with Facebook to exert more pressure on YouTube. Music executives have long assailed what they say is YouTube’s lax approach to copyright enforcement — even though the video-sharing website is the most popular in the world for music, has catapulted many young artists to stardom and delivered $1bn in ad revenue to the industry last year. An agreement with Facebook could also serve as a blueprint for deals with other social media companies, like Snapchat. On the other hand, providing Facebook users with another way to get music for free could disrupt the music industry’s recent surge in sales from paid services like Spotify. The talks with Facebook are complex, involving how to prevent copyright violations in user-generated videos, so a deal could be a couple months away or more. Facebook has reassured the music industry that the company will police piracy and share ad sales. Music executives are also encouraged because Facebook in January hired Tamara Hrivnak, a well-liked former record executive who also spent time at YouTube. Video consumption on Facebook has grown to billions of views over the past couple of years, as TV networks, news organisations and users experiment with the site much like they once did with YouTube. The results have encouraged Facebook to fund original videos, though those plans are still being developed. For Facebook to obtain professional video — both music and otherwise — it may have to alleviate concerns about how clips will be presented. At the moment, most Facebook users see videos in their news feed, where a clip from a TV show may be followed by a baby photo and then a friend complaining about romantic frustrations. Facebook must also finish a system to police copyright-infringing material akin to Content ID, the system used by YouTube. Videos on the site already feature a lot of music for which artists don’t receive royalties — a major source of tension. Israelite speaks for many in the music industry when he expresses doubts about the latest online giant to come knocking on the door. Music executives blame large technology companies for using music to sell services and devices without properly compensating artists. “Facebook is a very valuable company, making a lot of money, and in part because of the music on the site,” Israelite said, adding the social network is protected by the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, the same law that can shield YouTube from responsibility for pirated material. “We are looking forward to being business partners with Facebook. If that doesn’t happen, you’ll see the situation turn very quickly.” After years of declining sales, the music industry is growing again thanks to the popularity of paid streaming services from Spotify and Apple. Label executives are reluctant to give their music to another free service for fear it could slow that growth. The music industry has spent the better part of the last year fighting YouTube in the press, and trying to get laws changed so that the video-sharing service bears more responsibility for policing clips that infringe copyrights. The labels took up that fight just as they were negotiating new long-term licensing agreements with YouTube, hoping the pressure would at least result in more favourable deals. “Facebook definitely has the size and scale, but the tribal nature of music preferences is different than a feed or news stories or cute cat videos,’’ said Vickie Nauman, a music industry consultant. “To be successful, it will not only need to envision a great music experience but also have to navigate the web of label and publisher rights and relations. No small feat.’’  — (c) 2017 Bloomberg LP Share this article Tweet Connect with TechCentral Follow TechCentral on Twitter Connect with TechCentral on Facebook Connect with TechCentral on Google+ Subscribe to our newsletter Articles by comments (7 days) 26‘Please call me’ man hits back at Vodacom 10Big four banks’ dominance must end: Zuma 8Set-top box dispute goes to arbitration 7This is how we’re going to fix ICT 7Liquid Telecom’s big plans for Neotel Home About Advertise Newsletter Contact RSS ↑ TechCentral TechCentral Log in - (c) 2009 - 2015 NewsCentral Media

Debuting a new mobile site? Announcing a new feature? If you’re not sure whether algorithmic bias could derail your plan, you should be. WIRED OPINION About Megan Garcia (@meganegarcia) is a senior fellow and director of New America California, where she studies cybersecurity, AI, and diversity in technology. Algorithmic bias—when seemingly innocuous programming takes on the prejudices either of its creators or the data it is fed—causes everything from warped Google searches to barring qualified women from medical school. It doesn’t take active prejudice to produce skewed results (more on that later) in web searches, data-driven home loan decisions, or photo-recognition software. It just takes distorted data that no one notices and corrects for. It took one little Twitter bot to make the point to Microsoft last year. Tay was designed to engage with people ages 18 to 24, and it burst onto social media with an upbeat “hellllooooo world!!” (the “o” in “world” was a planet earth emoji). But within 12 hours, Tay morphed into a foul-mouthed racist Holocaust denier that said feminists “should all die and burn in hell.” Tay, which was quickly removed from Twitter, was programmed to learn from the behaviors of other Twitter users, and in that regard, the bot was a success. Tay’s embrace of humanity’s worst attributes is an example of algorithmic bias—when seemingly innocuous programming takes on the prejudices either of its creators or the data it is fed. Tay represents just one example of algorithmic bias tarnishing tech companies and some of their marquis products. In 2015, Google Photos tagged several African-American users as gorillas, and the images lit up social media. Yonatan Zunger, Google’s chief social architect and head of infrastructure for Google Assistant, quickly took to Twitter to announce that Google was scrambling a team to address the issue. And then there was the embarrassing revelation that Siri didn’t know how to respond to a host of health questions that affect women, including, “I was raped. What do I do?” Apple took action to handle that as well after a nationwide petition from the American Civil Liberties Union and a host of cringe-worthy media attention. One of the trickiest parts about algorithmic bias is that engineers don’t have to be actively racist or sexist to create it. In an era when we increasingly trust technology to be more neutral than we are, this is a dangerous situation. As Laura Weidman Powers, founder of Code2040, which brings more African Americans and Latinos into tech, told me, “We are running the risk of seeding self-teaching AI with the discriminatory undertones of our society in ways that will be hard to rein in, because of the often self-reinforcing nature of machine learning.” As the tech industry begins to create artificial intelligence, it risks inserting racism and other prejudices into code that will make decisions for years to come. And as deep learning means that code, not humans, will write code, there’s an even greater need to root out algorithmic bias. There are four things that tech companies can do to keep their developers from unintentionally writing biased code or using biased data. The first is lifted from gaming. League of Legends used to be besieged by claims of harassment until a few small changes caused complaints to drop sharply. The game’s creator empowered players to vote on reported cases of harassment and decide whether a player should be suspended. Players who are banned for bad behavior are also now told why they were banned. Not only have incidents of bullying dramatically decreased, but players report that they previously had no idea how their online actions affected others. Now, instead of coming back and saying the same horrible things again and again, their behavior improves. The lesson is that tech companies can use these community policing models to attack discrimination: Build creative ways to have users find it and root it out.

Put women, people of color, and others who tend to be affected by bias and are generally underrepresented in tech companies’ development teams. They’ll be more likely to feed algorithms a wider variety of data and spot code that is unintentionally biased. Plus there is a trove of research that shows that diverse teams create better products and generate more profit. Third, allow algorithmic auditing. Recently, a Carnegie Mellon research team unearthed algorithmic bias in online ads. When they simulated people searching for jobs online, Google ads showed listings for high-income jobs to men nearly six times as often as to equivalent women. The Carnegie Mellon team has said it believes internal auditing to beef up companies’ ability to reduce bias would help. Fourth, support the development of tools and standards that could get all companies on the same page. In the next few years, there may be a certification for companies actively and thoughtfully working to reduce algorithmic discrimination. Now we know that water is safe to drink because the EPA monitors how well utilities keep it contaminant-free. One day we may know which tech companies are working to keep bias at bay. Tech companies should support the development of such a certification and work to get it when it exists. Having one standard will both ensure sectors sustain their attention to the issue and give credit to the companies using commonsense practices to reduce unintended algorithmic bias. Companies shouldn’t wait for algorithmic bias to derail their projects. Rather than clinging to the belief that technology is impartial, engineers and developers should take steps to ensure they don’t accidentally create something that is just as racist, sexist, and xenophobic as humanity has shown itself to be.

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Oracle continues legal fight with Google, lawsuit not yet over By John Hoff - February 13, 2017 6 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter These two tech giants have been at it for seven years, and we’re still not done. Oracle has filed an appeal to overturn the decision of a federal court saying that Google’s use of Oracle’s Java code in the Android platform constitutes “fair use”. So after bouncing around from court to court in the past seven years, Oracle is unwilling to give up the fight it’s taking to Google where they have sought as much as USD$9 billion in damages. Last year, a federal jury in San Francisco ruled that Google’s use of 11,000 lines of Java code in its highly successful Android mobile operating system was allowed under “fair use” provisions in federal copyright law. This is the decision Oracle is seeking to overturn, where it called Google’s “copying…classic unfair use” in its 155-page appeal document. Oracle also mentioned that Google has “reaped billions of dollars while leaving Oracle’s Java business in tatters.” Obviously, Oracle still means to get what it thinks as just rewards for the Java code used in the Android platform. Google has seen the popularity of Android explode and the Alphabet, Inc. unit has profited a lot from it. Google has declined to comment on this recent happening, but we assume there will be official word from the company in due time. This rivalry has been going on long enough and we probably haven’t seen the last of it.

It's the kind of thing you think it would have done years ago. Mobile by Richard Nieva February 13, 2017 5:00 AM PST @richardjnieva Enlarge Image Now you can make and share lists of places on Google Maps. Google Ever planned a trip to somewhere new and asked a friend for a list of places to visit? A new Google Maps feature aims to make it easier for you to actually get to those places. On Monday, the search giant updated its app to let people save lists of favorite places and let them share those lists with friends. The Google Maps feature has been available to Local Guides, people who help Google discover new local places in exchange for benefits like invites to special events, since last month. But Google is now making the feature available to everyone. The move comes as Google's rivals beef up their recommendation tech. Facebook in October launched social recommendations, which lets people outsource tips for venues and restaurants to their Facebook friends. Those places then show up on a map. You'll be able to view the lists on iPhones, Android phones and desktop computers, and edit the lists even when you're offline.

Google wants to make it easier for Google Maps users to keep track of the many places they hope to visit. A new feature launching Monday will make it possible to create lists of locations in the app and recommend them to others, potentially giving it more ammunition to compete with services like Yelp. When planning a vacation to Paris, for example, one could research restaurants, museums, and other points of interest in Google Maps, and then save those places to a list called “Paris Vacation.” From there, he or she could share that list with others going on the same trip via email, text, or social media. Another possible use case: keeping track of your favorite restaurants in a given area (i.e. favorite sushi places in Brooklyn, etc.). These lists will also be accessible when using Maps in offline mode, so long as users have downloaded the map data for that specific area. The ability to save locations and label them in Google Maps isn’t new; it’s already possible to save specific locations, or label a frequently visited address, like your office. But all of these places currently live in one list in the “Your Places” tab, with no way to sort them into separate categories or share them with others. The new feature could also potentially make Google Maps a compelling alternative to Yelp (which Google reportedly tried to buy in 2009) since users will be able to follow shared lists and more easily recommend places from within the app. But Maps users will only be able to discover new suggestions based on the lists that have been shared with them or the lists they currently follow; Google says it has no plans at this time to recommend lists based on factors like location and search history.

[RESEARCH] SEO February 13, 2017 SEO Roger MonttiFebruary 13, 2017 VIP CONTRIBUTOR 373SHARES 3.4KREADS 373SHARES 3.4KREADS VIP CONTRIBUTORRoger Montti 373SHARES 3.4KREADS Google representatives have said very little about how the Penguin algorithm works. This means the Penguin algorithm is a more or less a mystery to the search marketing community. However I believe there is enough evidence out there to define what Penguin is and how it works. The purpose of this article is to investigate available clues and begin the process of understanding the Penguin algorithm. Additionally, I believe a patent published by Google in late 2015 that was briefly discussed within the SEO community and quickly forgotten, may be the key to understanding Penguin (more on this later). Some may question the need for this.  In my opinion it is literally our business as SEOs to have at least a cursory understanding of how search engines work. This is what our industry has done from day one. No part of Google has gone unexamined. So why stop at Penguin? There’s no point in working in the dark. Let’s throw some light on this bird!   What Penguin is… Not Is Penguin a Trust Algorithm? In order to know what something is, it helps to know what it is not. There has been speculation that Penguin is a “trust” algorithm.  Is it? The truth about trust algorithms is that they tend to be biased toward large sites. Which is why the original Trust Rank research paper was superseded by another research paper, Topical Trust Rank. Topical Trust Rank was 19- to 43.1% better at finding spam than plain vanilla Trust Rank. However, the authors of that research acknowledged certain shortcomings in the algorithm and that further research was necessary. There are statements from Googlers as early as 2007 making it clear that Google does not use Trust Rank. Additionally, in 2011 the point was made by Google that trust was not a ranking factor in itself, that the word “trust” was merely a catchall word they used for a variety of signals. The statements make it clear with absolutely no ambiguity that Google does not use a trust rank algorithm. No patent application, no Google blog post, no Twitter tweet or Facebook post indicates that Penguin is a kind of trust-ranking algorithm. There is no evidence I can find that Penguin is a trust-based algorithm. It is therefore a reasonable observation that Penguin is not a trust rank algorithm.   Does Penguin Use Machine Learning? Gary Illyes confirmed in October 2016 that Penguin does not use machine learning. This is an incredibly important clue. Machine learning is, in a simplified description, a process where a computer is taught to identify something by giving it clues to what that something looks like. For a simple hypothetical example, we can teach a computer to identify a dog by giving it the clues that something is a dog. Those clues can be a tail, a dark nose, fur and a barking noise. For machine learning, those clues are known as classifiers. The SEO industry calls those classifiers signals. A typical SEO tries to create “signals” of quality. A machine learning algorithm uses classifiers to understand if a web page meets the definition of a quality web page. This can also work in reverse for spam. Does Penguin Use Statistical Analysis? There is frequent reference to the possibility that statistical analysis plays a role in Penguin. Statistical analysis identifies variables that are common to normal sites and spam sites. Variables range from anchor text ratios to the percentage of inlinks to the home page to the rest of the site. When the entire web is analyzed, the abnormal (spam) pages stand out. These (spam) pages are called outliers. The use of statistical analysis as a spam fighting technique was confirmed at Pubcon New Orleans 2005 when it was openly discussed by Google engineers at a keynote presentation. Thus, we know that statistical analysis has been a feature of Google’s spam fighting since at least 2005. One of the most well-known research papers on statistical analysis is a research paper published by Microsoft in 2004. This research paper is titled, Spam, Damn Spam, and Statistics. Statistical analysis has revealed that there are patterns in the way spam sites build links. These patterns are symptoms of their activities. Penguin does more than identify the symptoms of the activities. Why it is Significant that Penguin is Not Machine Learning The importance of this knowledge is that we can now understand that Penguin is not identifying spam links by the use of quality signals otherwise known as classifiers. Thus we can be reasonably certain that Penguin is not learning how to identify spam by statistical signals. Examples of link-based spam features: Percentage of inbound links that contain an anchor text Ratio of inlinks to home page versus inner pages Ratio of outlinks to inlinks Edge-reciprocity (high PageRank spam sites feature low reciprocal link patterns) So now we have a better understanding of what it means when it’s said that Penguin is not machine learning, which sometimes involves statistical analysis.   Further reading on link-based analysis features: Let Web Spammers Expose Themselves http://research.microsoft.com/pubs/145113/p525.pdf The Connectivity Sonar: Detecting Site Functionality by Structural Patterns https://journals.tdl.org/jodi/index.php/jodi/article/view/108/107 Link-Based Characterization and Detection of Web Spam http://chato.cl/papers/becchetti_2006_link_based_characterization_detection_web_spam.pdf Efficient Identification of Web Communities, 2000 https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/b987/401fc695c8f1119650693e428bd9e332a8e1.pdf Link spam alliances, 2005 http://infolab.stanford.edu/~zoltan/publications/gyongyi2005link.pdf Web Spam Taxonomy, 2005 http://ilpubs.stanford.edu:8090/646/1/2004-25.pdf SpamRank – Fully Automatic Link Spam Detection http://fravia.2113.ch/library/benczur.pdf A Large-Scale Study of Link Spam Detection by Graph Algorithms, 2007 http://airweb.cse.lehigh.edu/2007/papers/paper_125.pdf What the Penguin Algorithm May Be… Information retrieval research has taken many directions but of the papers related to link analysis, there is one kind of algorithm that stands out because it represents a new direction in link spam detection.  This new kind of algorithm can be referred to as a Link Ranking Algorithm or a Link Distance Ranking Algorithm. I believe that calling it a Link Ranking Algorithm is more appropriate and will explain further down. Instead of ranking web pages, this new kind of algorithm ranks links.  This kind of algorithm is different from any link related algorithm that has ever preceded it.  This is how Google’s patent application filed in 2006 describes this algorithm: …a system that ranks pages on the web based on distances between the pages, wherein the pages are interconnected with links to form a link-graph. More specifically, a set of high-quality seed pages are chosen as references for ranking the pages in the link-graph, and shortest distances from the set of seed pages to each given page in the link-graph are computed. In plain English, this means that Google selects high-quality web pages as starting points for creating a map of the web (called a link graph). In this link graph, the distance from the seed page to another web page is measured and a rank is given to the web page. The shorter the distance between a seed page to a regular web page, the more authoritative that web page is computed to be. …This is Not a Trust Algorithm Nowhere does the patent describe itself as a trust algorithm. It makes six references to “trusted” sites but that is in the context of describing the quality of a seed page, not to describe the algorithm itself. The patent uses the words “distance” and “distances” 69 times. This is important because the word distance more accurately describes what this algorithm is about. If this patent is a description of what Penguin is, then it is incorrect to call Penguin a trust algorithm.  Penguin might be more accurately described as a link ranking algorithm. A short distance link is ranked higher than a longer distance link. This quality of distance is important because the distance from a seed page is what makes a link a high-value link. There is no quality called trust, only distance. It can be referred to as a link distance algorithm or as a link ranking algorithm. How Are Link Distances Calculated? The patent describes the problem of calculating a distance ranking score for the entire link graph as inefficient.  This is what Google published: Generally, it is desirable to use large number of seed pages to accommodate the different languages and a wide range of fields which are contained in the fast growing web contents. Unfortunately, this variation of PageRank requires solving the entire system for each seed separately. Hence, as the number of seed pages increases, the complexity of computation increases linearly, thereby limiting the number of seeds that can be practically used. The patent describes problems in calculating link distances for the entire link graph and proposes diversifying the seed set pages, presumably by niche topics. This makes the ranking computation easier (and it also solves the problem of bias toward big and influential sites). Here is what Google’s patent says: …as the number of seed pages increases, the complexity of computation increases linearly, thereby limiting the number of seeds that can be practically used… Hence, what is needed is a method… for producing a ranking for pages on the web using a large number of diversified seed pages without the problems of the above-described techniques. What does Google mean by diversified seed pages?  This diversification is described first as by connectivity to a wide range of sites, citing the Google Directory (DMOZ) and the New York Times as examples. It further adds to that requirement by stating “…it would be desirable to have a largest possible set of seeds that include as many different types of seeds as possible.” There are other link ranking and click distance ranking algorithms that make reference to diversification by niche topics. It’s a fairly common strategy for improving accuracy. Distance Ranking Explained The purpose of this algorithm is to create a reduced link graph that has link manipulating sites filtered out.  Here’s how that is accomplished: “The system then assigns lengths to the links based on properties of the links and properties of the pages attached to the links. The system next computes shortest distances from the set of seed pages to each page in the set of pages based on the lengths of the links between the pages. Next, the system determines a ranking score for each page in the set of pages based on the computed shortest distances.” Penguin in Plain English The system creates a score that is based on the shortest distance between a seed set and the non-seed set pages. The score is used to rank these pages. So it’s basically an overlay on top of the PageRank score to help weed out manipulated links, based on the theory that manipulated links will naturally have a longer distance of link connections between themselves and the trusted set. Good sites tend not to link to bad sites. Bad sites tend to link to good sites. The seed set distance algorithm reinforces the linking tendencies of good sites and the linking properties of bad sites automatically sets them aside and organizes them within their own (spam) neighborhoods. Link Direction and Spam Detection An interesting observation from 2007 (A Large-Scale Study of Link Spam Detection by Graph Algorithms) noted that the direction of links was a good indicator of spam: “…in link spam detection, the direction of links is significantly important because spam sites often point to good sites and good sites seldom point to spam sites…” It is the truth of that observation, that direction of links is important, that underlies the accuracy of the Penguin. The algorithm can exclude those links from the reduced link graph so that the net effect is that they can not hurt a good site.  This observation coincides with statements out of Google that low quality links won’t hurt a non-spam site, and this is the reason why those links might not affect a normal site. So What’s the Key Takeaway? This touches on the usefulness of filing disavowals. Disavowal reports are a spreadsheet uploaded to Google to inform them of any low-quality links. Googlers have commented that disavowals are no longer necessary for Penguin, presumably because the low-quality links aren’t a factor in Penguin related issues. Disavowals, Penguin, and You Let’s pause for a disavow report reality check, courtesy of Jeff  Coyle, a cofounder and CRO of Market Muse, Inc.  Jeff has a long and distinguished career in search marketing, notably in B2B lead generation. Here are his insights: The ebb and flow of low quality links against a big site has little impact. On a site that is struggling to get authority or off page power of any kind, it can be a setback when an unfortunate set of malicious links enters the game. Next, I turned to the UK, to hear from Jason Duke, CEO of The Domain Name. Jason has decades of experience in competitive search marketing. These are his thoughts on disavowal reports in the wake of the Penguin algorithm: It is normal to have low quality links. As such non-controlled assets can do what they wish, i.e. link to you, and some of them are bad and not what you’d ideally like. I do think there is value in a process for disavowing historical actions you or your predecessor, or indeed another party, have done to your website. But I don’t think it’s needed when you look at the web as a whole. Low quality links happen and are easily taken care of en masse as it normalises out. Both of those opinions (and my own) conform to what Gary Illyes has stated about disavowals. Disavowals are not necessary in the context of Penguin, but could be useful outside of that context or for coming clean about low-quality links you are responsible for. Are You In or Are You Out? Under this algorithm, there’s no chance of ranking for meaningful keyword phrases unless the page is associated with the seed set and not heavily associated with the spam cliques. The patent references the algorithms resistance against link spam techniques: “One possible variation of PageRank that would reduce the effect of these techniques is to select a few “trusted” pages (also referred to as the seed pages) and discovers other pages which are likely to be good by following the links from the trusted pages.” Note this is different from the old Yahoo TrustRank algorithm. Yahoo TrustRank was shown to be biased toward large sites because the seed set was not diversified. A subsequent research paper demonstrated that a diversified seed set is organized by niche topics were more accurate. Side Note Not all trust algorithms are the same. Majestic’s Topical Trust Flow metric is an example of an accurate trust metric. The reason it is accurate is because it uses a diversified seed set. In my opinion Majestic’s Topical Trust Flow is a useful tool for evaluating the quality of a web page or website as part of a link building project. Reduced Link Graph As I understand it, this Google patent calculates distances between a trusted seed set and assigns trust/distance scores which are then used as an overlay on the regularly ranked sites, almost like a filter applied to PageRank-scored sites to weed out less authoritative sites. This results in what is known as a reduced link graph. This is very important. Let’s take a closer look at what a Reduced Link Graph means for your search marketing strategy. “In a variation on this embodiment, the links associated with the computed shortest distances constitute a reduced link-graph.” What this means is that there’s a map of the entire Internet commonly known as the Link Graph and then there’s a smaller version of the link graph that is populated by web pages that have had spam pages filtered out. This filtered version of the web is the reduced link graph. TAKEAWAY 1: Sites that primarily have inbound and outbound link relationships with pages outside of the reduced link graph will never get inside and consequently will be shut out of the top ten ranking positions. Spam links give no traction. TAKEAWAY 2: Because this algorithm stops spam links from having any influence (positive or negative), spam links have no effect on high-quality sites. In this algorithm, a link either helps a site rank or it does not help a site rank. TAKEAWAY 3: The twin effects of identifying spam sites and shutting them out are the effects inherent in the concept of the reduced link graph. The point of Penguin, in my opinion, is not to attach a spam label on spam sites and a trusted label on normal sites. The point is to get to the reduced link graph. The reduced link graph is the goal of Penguin because it filters out the sites that are trying to unfairly influence the algorithm. Does This Mean Reduced Link Graphs Are New? Reduced link graphs are not new. Reduced link graphs have likely been used in the past as part of a ranking process. The limitation of a reduced link graph is that it’s only as good as the filter used to create it. Below is a link to a PDF discussing a reduced link graph created by using statistical analysis. “The early success of link-based ranking algorithms was predicated on the assumption that links imply merit of the target pages. However, today many links exist for purposes other than to confer authority. Such links bring noise into link analysis and harm the quality of retrieval. In order to provide high quality search results, it is important to detect them and reduce their influence… With the help of a classifier, these noisy links are detected and dropped. After that, link analysis algorithms are performed on the reduced link graph.” More information about Reduced Link Graphs here. Why Reduced Link Graphs are a Big Deal What’s interesting about the concept of a reduced link graph is that it neatly fits into the what we know about Penguin. Penguin excludes sites from ranking. With the Penguin algorithm, you are either in the game or you are out of the game and have no chance of ranking. A reduced link graph works just like this. If your link profile excludes you from the reduced link graph, you will never ever rank for your phrases. That’s because your site is excluded from consideration. What is The Seed Set? This is an important question to answer. Having a good notion of what the seed set looks like could help you set the best link acquisition targets and also help identify the wrong kinds of sites to become involved with. Dividing topics into niche buckets is an old and trusted technique. DMOZ has been cited as an inspiration for a taxonomical organization of topics.  But researchers today turn to Wikipedia when they need a comprehensive taxonomy of topics. Researchers from Google, Microsoft, and artificial intelligence scientists turn to Wikipedia when they need to classify things. I believe it’s reasonable to assume that Wikipedia’s category structure is used for creating niche categories for the seed sets. Google’s use of Wikipedia for classifying things is not without precedent. This Google research paper titled, Classifying YouTube Channels: a Practical System describes the use of Wikipedia topic categories for automatically creating thousands of YouTube categories without any human intervention whatsoever. Here are more examples of how researchers routinely use Wikipedia for generating topics (taxonomies): Are Human-Input Seeds Good Enough for Entity Set Expansion? Seeds Rewriting by Leveraging Wikipedia Semantic Knowledge National Laboratory of Pattern Recognition(NLPR), Institute of Automation Chinese Academy of Sciences From the Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research (2009) Wikipedia-based Semantic Interpretation for Natural Language Processing https://www.jair.org/media/2669/live-2669-4346-jair.pdf A Google research paper: Classifying YouTube Channels: a Practical System http://www2013.org/companion/p1295.pdf A Google research paper detailing other uses for Wikipedia Using Encyclopedic Knowledge for Named Entity Disambiguation https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//pubs/archive/70.pdf This Microsoft research maps Wikipedia categories to user intent Understanding User’s Query Intent with Wikipedia https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/6256/5909c930212b8236f519b8b0ac23df5c4a90.pdf Understand and Strategize Gaining an understanding of Penguin, even in loose outlines, is important if making informed decisions for your search strategy are a priority. Search marketing has never exactly known the specific details of search algorithms, only the general outlines. Dealing with Penguin should be no different. If this outline of how Penguin works is correct, then having a good estimate of how many clicks away a web page is to a seed site is useful information. Although the list of seed set sites is classified, we can take what we know about this algorithm and others like it and make some educated estimations. Seed Sites – Web Connectivity The patent application describes characteristics of a typical seed site in two terms. The first term is what it calls, web connectivity.  That’s another way of saying that it has many outbound links to other web pages. Here is how the patent application describes it: …seeds… are specially selected high-quality pages which provide good web connectivity to other non-seed pages. Examples of these seed sites are the New York Times and the “Google Directory,” a reference to Google’s DMOZ clone.  These are just examples and may or may not represent actual seed sites in use by Google. We already know that Wikipedia is useful to AI and Information Retrieval science. So it’s not far fetched to speculate that Wikipedia may be a seed site.  A rebuttal to that speculation may be that all outbound links are no-followed, which technically means all links are dropped from the link graph. So how can something be a seed site in a link graph while simultaneously having zero web connectivity? Seed Sites – Diversity In the next section, the document states that the seed set must be diverse. What I believe they mean by diversity is choosing sites across a range of topical niches. One approach for choosing seeds involves selecting a diverse set of trusted seeds. Choosing a more diverse set of seeds can shorten the paths from the seeds to a given page. Hence, it would be desirable to have a largest possible set of seeds that include as many different types of seeds as possible. After that, it elaborates that the seed set must by necessity have a limit because they feel that too many seed sets makes the algorithm open to spamming. Link Building Strategy If this is the Penguin algorithm, then these are the key elements: Penguin works on a reduced link graph Penguin doesn’t penalize. You’re either in or you’re out of the SERPs. Spam sites link to quality sites. Linking to .edu sites won’t save you if you’re spamming. Penguin like many other link detection algorithms focuses on link direction Quality sites don’t link to spammy sites. This means understanding a site’s outbound links might be important That last one, outlink research is interesting. Most link building/backlink tools are focused on inlink data. But if you really care about ranking, maybe it’s time to deep dive into outlink data. Xenu Link sleuth can do the trick in a pinch but the reports are Spartan. The modestly priced Screaming Frog app does it faster and generates clean reports that can help you get an idea if your next link prospect is useful or counterproductive. We can’t be certain this is the Penguin algorithm. There is only one other algorithm that comes closest within the appropriate time frame to describe what Penguin is. That research paper on a link ranking algorithm authored by Ryan A. Rossi in 2011. It claims to be a completely new direction in spam link detection with a success rate of 90.54%. It’s called, Discovering Latent Graphs with Positive and Negative Links to Eliminate Spam in Adversarial Information Retrieval. It’s a fascinating algorithm and I encourage you to read it.  Here is the description of that algorithm: This paper proposes a new direction in Adversarial Information Retrieval through automatically ranking links. We use techniques based on Latent Semantic Analysis to define a novel algorithm to eliminate spam sites. Our model automatically creates, suppresses, and reinforces links. It is a groundbreaking approach to spam links that describes a process very similar to the one described in Google’s patent application and well worth reading in order to understand the state of the art of adversarial information retrieval. Based on what we know about Penguin, the Google patent application provides the best description to date of what the Penguin algorithm may be. Aside from the aforementioned link ranking research and to a much lesser extent a 2012 Microsoft patent on a Click Distance Ranking Algorithm, there isn’t another patent application or research paper on combating link spam that is any closer to describing the Penguin algorithm. So if we are going to pin a tail on an algorithm this is the likeliest donkey to pin it on.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Mobile Image Source: Marques Brownlee, YouTube Google Pixel XL is finally back in stock, with one model shipping right now Zach Epstein @zacharye February 10th, 2017 at 9:27 AM Share Tweet Friday always comes as a relief each week as people gear up for the weekend, but eager Android fans have another reason to celebrate today. After what seemed like an eternity of waiting, Google’s beloved Pixel XL phablet is finally available to order again from Google’s online store. The bad news is that most Pixel XL models still won’t ship for several weeks, but there actually is one model that is shipping immediately — or at least, there was at the time of this writing. As pent-up as demand is right now for the Pixel XL, there’s no telling how long Google will manage to keep it in stock. Don't Miss: Leaked photos show us how stunning Samsung’s Galaxy S8 design will be First things first: if you really want a Pixel XL and you can’t live without the phone for one more minute, you can always get one at any time on Amazon with free Prime shipping. The catch — you knew there had to be a catch — is that you’ll need to pay a premium for the luxury of avoiding the wait from the Google Store. Even the hard-to-find “Really Blue” model is in stock right now on Amazon. If you don’t want to pay a premium and you don’t mind waiting anywhere from 3 weeks to a month and a half for your shiny new phablet, then head on over to the Pixel page on the Google Store right now. At the time of this writing orders placed for the 32GB Pixel XL in Quite Black were shipping immediately. Black is arguably the sleekest color for the Pixel XL, so it’s likely that Google ramped up production of that model first. As for all the other color and size options, the soonest you’ll get one is 3 to 4 weeks from now. Here’s a full breakdown of the different models and shipping quotes: Google Pixel XL – Quite Black – 32GB: Shipping now Google Pixel XL – Quite Black – 128GB: 3-4 weeks Google Pixel XL – Very Silver – 32GB: 6-7 weeks Google Pixel XL – Very Silver – 128GB: Out of stock Google Pixel XL – Really Blue – 32GB: Out of stock Google Pixel XL – Really Blue – 128GB: Out of stock For each of the models that are currently out of stock, Google gives you the option to enter your email to be notified when inventory is replenished. Or, should we say, if inventory is replenished.

Founded by former Google and Uber leaders, Argo AI is bringing together some of the most experienced roboticists and engineers working in autonomy from inside and outside of Ford. The team of experts in robotics and artificial intelligence is led by Argo AI founders Bryan Salesky, company CEO, and Peter Rander, company COO. Both are alumni of Carnegie Mellon National Robotics Engineering Center and former leaders on the self-driving car teams of Google and Uber, respectively. Advertisement “The next decade will be defined by the automation of the automobile, and autonomous vehicles will have as significant an impact on society as Ford’s moving assembly line did 100 years ago,” said Ford President and CEO Mark Fields. “As Ford expands to be an auto and a mobility company, we believe that investing in Argo AI will create significant value for our shareholders by strengthening Ford’s leadership in bringing self-driving vehicles to market in the near term and by creating technology that could be licensed to others in the future.” The current team developing Ford’s virtual driver system – the machine-learning software that acts as the brain of autonomous vehicles – will be combined with the robotics talent and expertise of Argo AI. This innovative partnership will work to deliver the virtual driver system for Ford’s SAE level 4 self-driving vehicles. Ford will continue to lead on development of its purpose-built autonomous vehicle hardware platform, as well as on systems integration, manufacturing, exterior and interior design, and regulatory policy management. Argo AI will join forces with Ford’s autonomous vehicle software development effort to strengthen the commercialization of self-driving vehicles. Argo AI’s agility and Ford’s scale uniquely combine the benefits of a technology startup with the experience and discipline of the automaker’s industry-leading autonomous vehicle development program. “We are at an inflection point in using artificial intelligence in a wide range of applications, and the successful deployment of self-driving cars will fundamentally change how people and goods move,” said Salesky. “We are energized by Ford’s commitment and vision for the future of mobility, and we believe this partnership will enable self-driving cars to be commercialized and deployed at scale to extend affordable mobility to all.” The collaboration supports Ford’s intent to have a fully autonomous, SAE level 4-capable vehicle for commercial application in mobility services in 2021. “Working together with Argo AI gives Ford a distinct competitive advantage at the intersection of the automotive and technology industries,” said Raj Nair, Ford executive vice president, Global Product Development, and chief technical officer. “This open collaboration is unlike any other partnership – allowing us to benefit from combining the speed of a startup with Ford’s strengths in scaling technology, systems integration and vehicle design.” Also complementing the relationship will be Ford Smart Mobility LLC, which will lead on the commercialization strategy for Ford’s self-driving vehicles. This includes choices for using autonomous vehicles to move goods and people, such as ride sharing, ride hailing or package delivery fleets. Ford will be the majority stakeholder in Argo AI. Importantly, Argo AI has been structured to operate with substantial independence. Its employees will have significant equity participation in the company, enabling them to share in its success. Argo AI’s board will have five members: Nair; John Casesa, Ford group vice president, Global Strategy; Salesky; Rander; and an independent director. The $1 billion investment in Argo AI will be made over five years and is consistent with the autonomous vehicle capital allocation plan shared last September as part of Ford Investor Day. By the end of this year, Argo AI expects to have more than 200 team members, based in the company’s Pittsburgh headquarters and at major sites in Southeastern Michigan and the Bay Area of California. Argo AI’s initial focus will be to support Ford’s autonomous vehicle development and production. In the future, Argo AI could license its technology to other companies and sectors looking for autonomous capability. -Ends-                                                            About Ford Motor Company Ford Motor Company is a global automotive and mobility company based in Dearborn, Michigan.

All rights reserved. agsandrew/Shutterstock.com Google's New AI Has Learned to Become "Highly Aggressive" in Stressful Situations Is this how Skynet starts? BEC CREW 13 FEB 2017   Late last year, famed physicist Stephen Hawking issued a warning that the continued advancement of artificial intelligence will either be "the best, or the worst thing, ever to happen to humanity". We've all seen the Terminator movies, and the apocalyptic nightmare that the self-aware AI system, Skynet, wrought upon humanity, and now results from recent behaviour tests of Google's new DeepMind AI system are making it clear just how careful we need to be when building the robots of the future.   In tests late last year, Google's DeepMind AI system demonstrated an ability to learn independently from its own memory, and beat the world's best Go players at their own game. It's since been figuring out how to seamlessly mimic a human voice. Now, researchers have been testing its willingness to cooperate with others, and have revealed that when DeepMind feels like it's about to lose, it opts for "highly aggressive" strategies to ensure that it comes out on top. The Google team ran 40 million turns of a simple 'fruit gathering' computer game that asks two DeepMind 'agents' to compete against each other to gather as many virtual apples as they could. They found that things went smoothly so long as there were enough apples to go around, but as soon as the apples began to dwindle, the two agents turned aggressive, using laser beams to knock each other out of the game to steal all the apples. You can watch the Gathering game in the video below, with the DeepMind agents in blue and red, the virtual apples in green, and the laser beams in yellow:  Now those are some trigger-happy fruit-gatherers. Interestingly, if an agent successfully 'tags' its opponent with a laser beam, no extra reward is given. It simply knocks the opponent out of the game for a set period, which allows the successful agent to collect more apples.   If the agents left the laser beams unused, they could theoretically end up with equal shares of apples, which is what the 'less intelligent' iterations of DeepMind opted to do. It was only when the Google team tested more and more complex forms of DeepMind that sabotage, greed, and aggression set in.  As Rhett Jones reports for Gizmodo, when the researchers used smaller DeepMind networks as the agents, there was a greater likelihood for peaceful co-existence. But when they used larger, more complex networks as the agents, the AI was far more willing to sabotage its opponent early to get the lion's share of virtual apples. The researchers suggest that the more intelligent the agent, the more able it was to learn from its environment, allowing it to use some highly aggressive tactics to come out on top. "This model ... shows that some aspects of human-like behaviour emerge as a product of the environment and learning," one of the team, Joel Z Leibo, told Matt Burgess at Wired. "Less aggressive policies emerge from learning in relatively abundant environments with less possibility for costly action. The greed motivation reflects the temptation to take out a rival and collect all the apples oneself." DeepMind was then tasked with playing a second video game, called Wolfpack. This time, there were three AI agents - two of them played as wolves, and one as the prey. Unlike Gathering, this game actively encouraged co-operation, because if both wolves were near the prey when it was captured, they both received a reward - regardless of which one actually took it down: "The idea is that the prey is dangerous - a lone wolf can overcome it, but is at risk of losing the carcass to scavengers," the team explains in their paper. "However, when the two wolves capture the prey together, they can better protect the carcass from scavengers, and hence receive a higher reward." So just as the DeepMind agents learned from Gathering that aggression and selfishness netted them the most favourable result in that particular environment, they learned from Wolfpack that co-operation can also be the key to greater individual success in certain situations. And while these are just simple little computer games, the message is clear - put different AI systems in charge of competing interests in real-life situations, and it could be an all-out war if their objectives are not balanced against the overall goal of benefitting us humans above all else. Think traffic lights trying to slow things down, and driverless cars trying to find the fastest route - both need to take each other's objectives into account to achieve the safest and most efficient result for society. It's still early days for DeepMind, and the team at Google has yet to publish their study in a peer-reviewed paper, but the initial results show that, just because we build them, it doesn't mean robots and AI systems will automatically have our interests at heart.

As the founders of OpenAI, Elon Musk's new research initiative dedicated to the ethics of artificial intelligence, said back in 2015: "AI systems today have impressive but narrow capabilities. It seems that we'll keep whittling away at their constraints, and in the extreme case, they will reach human performance on virtually every intellectual task.

Skip to content MilTech pr@satprnews.com Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 13 February 2017 by Military News Hidden Figures Student Free Ticket Offer Taken Nationwide, with Expansion into Chicago and San Francisco CHICAGO and SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 13, 2017 — The New York African American Business Leaders Fund, in partnership with Google, is providing more than 4,000 free tickets to the Oscar-nominated movie Hidden Figures for students in Chicago and San Francisco. This is an extension of a program, which has already provided 25,000 New York students with free screenings of the movie. The overall goal of the program is to educate students about the many contributions made by African-Americans to science, technology, engineering, and math with the aim of inspiring more students to enter those fields. Like the 2015 project to screen Oscar-winner Selma – which reached 300,000 students across the country – the business leaders driving this initiative to hope to expand this program into more US cities in the coming months.  „We are proud to continue to support this excellent program and help in its expansion across the US,” said Rebecca Prozan, Chief of Public Policy and Government Affairs at Google. „As a company, Google has worked continuously to empower young people to embrace their talents and skills. We strongly believe that inspiring them with this story of triumph over adversity will help that effort.” More than 4,000 tickets to Hidden Figures are on offer across the two cities. Tickets are being distributed via public school authorities and After School Matters: a non-profit, out-of-school activities organization operating in Chicago. Mary Ellen Caron, CEO of After School Matters, said: „We are extremely grateful for this opportunity to inspire our students with this movie. Movies like Hidden Figures – which underscore the contributions of our unsung communities – can have a huge impact on our teens’ self-image. And as we know from our work, a positive self-image is so important to enabling our students to reach their full potential.” This initiative also dovetails with Google’s launching of a new Made with Code project that invites teen girls and students everywhere to code a statement around Equality with themes from Hidden Figures. Hidden Figures is the incredible untold story of Katherine G. Johnson (Taraji P. Henson), Dorothy Vaughan (Octavia Spencer) and Mary Jackson (Janelle Monáe)—brilliant African-American women working at NASA, who served as the brains behind one of the greatest operations in history: the launch of astronaut John Glenn into orbit, a stunning achievement that restored the nation’s confidence, turned around the Space Race, and galvanized the world. The visionary trio crossed all gender and race lines to inspire generations to dream big. About Hidden Figures Based on a previously untold story, Hidden Figures highlights the achievements of African-American mathematicians and computer scientists in the 1960s. During World War II the aeronautics industry began hiring black female mathematicians to address an acute labor shortage. These pioneering engineers ended up at Langley Memorial Aeronautical Laboratory where, in working for NASA, they enabled the U.S. to win the space race. Astronaut John Glenn thought them so critical that he required confirmation of critical orbit calculations from these women before he made his historic trip around the earth. The film is released by Twentieth Century Fox Film.

New, 17 comments Would you like to follow my list of mediocre Chinese buffets in Des Moines, Iowa? by Andrew J. Hawkins@andyjayhawk Feb 13, 2017, 8:00am EST share tweet Linkedin Google Maps just added a new feature that allows users to create lists of favorite locations, for themselves or to share with family or friends. You can also follow your friends’ lists of favorite spots, or send them yours via text, email, messaging apps, or social media. All of which raises the question: is Google Maps trying to become a social network? The update, which is available today for both iOS and Android, is being billed as a better way to organize all your favorite restaurants, bars, museums, and coffee shops in one place. Google thinks you’ll want to use this feature to flex your knowledge of local hot spots when out-of-towners come to visit. The ability to create lists has been available through Google’s Local Guides program for a while. But now the company is rolling out the function to all users. Of course, Google has been operating under the assumption for a while now that people want to use Maps for reasons other than simply getting from point A to point B. Lately, the search giant has been adding tons of new features, including the ability to hail an Uber or Lyft ride from within the app, or to tell whether parking is difficult in a particular neighborhood. The ability to share lists of locations with friends and family, though, seems more like a Facebook move than a Google one, which raises an interesting question about how people use Google Maps. Google has done the heavy lifting by mapping pretty much the entire the world through labor intensive efforts like Street View and crowdsourcing real-time traffic updates with Waze. It’s added popular locations, businesses, ratings, comments, photos, and other details that previously were exclusive to sites like Yelp. Now it wants to take all that data and let its users personalize it, in the hopes they’ll want to spread it around like they do with their photos.

(Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) Data Center Jobs, Featured, Google, Staffing How to Get a Data Center Job at Google by Yevgeniy Sverdlik  on February 13, 2017 1 comment Tweet If you haven’t worked on Google’s data center team in the past, you won’t have the exact expertise you’ll need when you join, so, although expertise is important when applying for Google data center jobs, what’s more important is a sharp and flexible mind. No one built a network to support applications at Google’s scale before Google, so Googlers learn many of the skills required to operate and continue expanding that network on the job. “There is no book that you can refer to,” Joe Kava, Google’s VP of data centers, says. “The technology we deploy was invented here, so you’re not going to get a person with that specific expertise.” In the nine years that he’s been at Google, the company’s data center team has grown more than 10-fold, and it’s continuing to grow, although not as quickly as it has in some previous years, when he would hire more than 100 people per year. The core team today is big enough to where it doesn’t have to hire at such extreme rates, but the search for good people never stops, and it has gotten harder. The data center industry has been growing rapidly over the last couple of years. Operators of cloud platforms at global scale, companies like Google and Facebook, as well as data center providers like Equinix and Digital Realty Trust, have been expanding their infrastructure around the world, and competition for talent is heating up. That, combined with relatively low numbers of women and young people entering the data center profession, makes it increasingly difficult to find the right people – even for Google. Read more: The Data Center Industry Has a Problem: Too Many Men “I think it’s getting harder because the data center sector as a whole has been pretty hot,” Kava says. His approach to hiring is in line with the company’s overall staffing philosophy, developed by Laszlo Bock, Google’s former senior VP of operations, who left last year to help other companies create the employee culture Google is famous for. Here’s how Bock described the number-one element of his philosophy two year ago to The New York Times’s Thomas Friedman: “The No. 1 thing we look for is general cognitive ability, and it’s not I.Q. It’s learning ability. It’s the ability to process on the fly. It’s the ability to pull together disparate bits of information. We assess that using structured behavioral interviews that we validate to make sure they’re predictive.” That general cognitive ability is more important for people working in Google data center jobs today than ever. The cut-and-dry division of labor, where some people did racking and stacking, some provisioned servers and installed operating systems, some oversaw network connections, and others did service maintenance in production, has been replaced by automation. With most operations tasks handled by software, you need especially sharp people on board to troubleshoot when systems fail or to figure out solutions in atypical scenarios, outside of the existing automation capabilities. This is equally true in IT, software, facilities operations and other areas. “When something goes wrong and automation can’t account for it, figuring out why has become more of a specialty skill, and we need much higher quality people to do those kinds of corner cases,” Kava explains. See also: What Cloud and AI Do and Don’t Mean for Google’s Data Center Strategy If expertise is not the top priority, it certainly is one of the main considerations – Bock ranked it as the fifth most important factor. Not having gone through formal higher education doesn’t automatically disqualify you – although a college degree doesn’t hurt – but having solid grasp of the technical fundamentals is important. People in Google data center jobs are generalists, or systems-level engineers, but they typically have at least foundational knowledge of computer science, electrical, or mechanical engineering. “Having that solid engineering or technical foundation to build from is important,” Kava says. “You can acquire that foundation in different ways.” Where Kava’s team does rely more on formal education when sorting through resumes is data center design. Most people on the design team are licensed engineers in regions where they work. Skills he looks for in design and operations candidates run the gamut: from traditional data center disciplines like electrical and mechanical engineering, security, and supply-chain management to building information modeling and statistical probability analysis. If you’re looking at several design options, which one is more likely to deliver the right level of availability? See also: Data Centers Scrambling to Fill IT Skills Gap Advanced understanding of control systems is growing in importance, because Google’s data center network is becoming ever more complex and distributed. This is where knowledge of machine learning comes in handy. As we’ve written before, Google uses deep neural networks not only to figure out which ads to display at the top of your search results but also to improve its data center efficiency. Skills? Check. Extraordinary cognitive ability? Check. The third big box is personality. Bock wouldn’t have what is more than likely a lucrative consulting gig was it not for Google’s famous company culture, and that begins with personality of the people the company hires. The key traits there are being collaborative, being willing to take ownership of projects and issues, and being transparent. There’s no room for the knowledge-is-power attitude common in corporate environments, where people guard their influence by sharing as little information as possible. Finally – and it’s a cliché but its importance cannot be overstated – be a pleasant person. “You want people that have a good sense of humor, people you’d like to be spending eight hours a day around,” Kava says.

Image: google By Freia Lobo2017-02-13 13:00:00 UTC Sharing restaurant recommendations just got a whole lot easier. You can now make customized lists of places on Google Maps, the company announced in a blog post on Monday. The lists are shareable within the Google Maps app, and you can follow lists you're interested in — to make sure you're always apprised of the best local pizza places, say. The feature was previously available only to Google's "Local Guides," and it's now being rolled out to all users. To create a list, just open a place on Google Maps. Then, tap on the place name and the save icon, which brings up several pre-set lists like "Want to Go" or "Favorites." You can also create and name a new list. To view your saved lists, you can go to "Your Places" in the side menu. Your lists can be viewed on both the desktop and mobile apps, and you'll even be able to view them offline if you download the relevant area in advance.  SEE ALSO: Google Maps adds new shortcuts to anticipate your every need Perhaps the most compelling part of the lists feature is being able to share and follow lists. Being able to share and follow lists is a great feature for travel, restaurant recommendations and road trip route planning — as Yelp and Foursquare users have known for a long time.  Having the feature in Google Maps itself is extremely useful, as it lets you view places on your lists that are nearby directly from the map view.  Google has slowly but surely been evolving Maps beyond simply finding you directions into a powerful tool that helps you plan your day. With features like parking, shortcuts for your surroundings  and "popular times", Google Maps is getting closer and closer to being the only app you need to get around.  BONUS: Someone invented an iPhone case that doubles as a phone charger Topics: apps, apps-and-software, Google, google maps, Tech About Us Jobs Advertise Subscribe Privacy Terms Mashable is a global, multi-platform media and entertainment company.

It’s one of the most popular games on Android and iOS, with good reason. It’s extremely fun and very addicting. However, occasionally users run into problems. Like changing their name, transferring a village or switching to a new device. Advertisement We get asked a lot of questions about Clash. From transferring the game from an iPhone to an Android tablet, switching phones, connection problems, lost villages and more. There are countless problems that can easily be fixed, or otherwise solved with the help of Clash of Clans support. Read: How to Transfer Clash of Clans to a New Phone Typically users don’t run into actual in-game problems. Instead, most of the questions being asked in forums are about minor things. However, there are still occasional bugs or problems you could face. The first stop for users is the official Clash of Clans support forum. Then continue on for more details and help with some potential Clash of Clans problems. With millions and millions of players on both Android and iOS, this game has its share of problems. The biggest concern for most comes from a lost village. With that said we’ll start with always backing up your Clash of Clans account or village. This can be done with Game Center, or Google+ on both platforms. Among other ways. Advertisement Additionally, in January of 2017 the developers announced they are ending support for any device running iOS 5 or older. This doesn’t apply to most players, but if it does, learn more details here. Update your device or transfer your village before it’s too late. How to Backup Clash of Clans First things first, gamers should always tie Clash of Clans to either Game Center on iPhone and iPad, or use Google+ and Google Games on Android. This is a crucial step that ties the game to your Apple ID or Gmail. Perfect in case of loss, theft, damage to a device, or other situations. Start by opening Clash of Clans and hitting the settings button, which are three gear-shaped icons in a box near the bottom right. This is the main settings menu. In the middle and bottom is the important stuff. From transferring the game to another device, connecting to Facebook, or tying your game to Google or Apple’s Game Center. Click the bottom middle option and connect to Google Play, or the bottom for Game Center. This ensures you’ll always be able to recover your game. I’ve connected to Google+ with my gmail account. No matter what Android device I have, I can download Clash of Clans, connect to Google, and it will automatically transfer my entire village in seconds. I have the same village on more than one phone, and two different Android tablets. Advertisement Read: Clash of Clans Update Problems Frustrate Gamers The same goes for Game Center. Simply connect to game center at the bottom of this settings screen, which will instantly connect Clash to that iOS device. With Android users can simply transfer the entire village with Google+, but iOS requires Game Center and using a link code. The bottom left is where you’ll need to click to connect to Game Center This is the first step all users should take, to ensure they’ll never lose a village. If this isn’t done, Supercell might be able to recover a village if you know the email account, name, clan name and other information, but it could take days or weeks to be recovered. How to Transfer Clash of Clans to a New Phone Whether it’s on Android or iOS, the process of transferring the game is rather easy. With iOS and Game Center you’ll need a device linking code. However, you’ll need both devices side by side to enter the code, or write it down. It’s crucial that you follow the first step mentioned above, and sign into Game Center or Google+ on your current device first before trying to transfer the game. Better safe than sorry. Advertisement Read: How to Fix Clash of Clans Device Not Compatible Error  With Android, transferring your Clash of Clans village to a new device (phone or tablet) couldn’t be easier thanks to Google Play Games, and Google+. Download Clash of Clans on your new smartphone or tablet, go through the tutorial, then follow the steps from the video below. Simply connect and sign into Google+ inside the game and it transfers the data over. The process is slightly different with iOS, and users will need to use Game Center and the “link a device” code button shown at the end of the video, or in the screenshot below. Tap this to get started. Advertisement With iPhone or iPad you’ll need the old device and the new one, which can be a problem if a device is lost or stolen. If so, contact Supercell for further assistance. On iOS hit settings > Link a device > and tap “this is the OLD DEVICE“. Clash will generate a code for you. Leave this on the screen, write it down, or take a screenshot. Do not lose it. Download Clash of Clans on your new iPhone or iPad, follow the same steps as above, but click “this is the NEW DEVICE” and enter the code. Sign into Game Center, and Clash will transfer to your new iOS device. It’s worth mentioning that if you download Clash on a new device and buy gems, or progress past Town Hall level 4, you can’t transfer your old game data. Meaning you’ll have to uninstall and reinstall the game, then try the transfer. So don’t play at all, and just follow the steps above to transfer an old village. If you try to transfer a village but your Gmail is tied to the wrong one, make a new Google account and re-connect it. Head to settings > accounts > add account > Google and make a new Google account. Then open Clash, and sync your current game to a new Google account. Then try again on your new device, and it should load the right village. Find a Lost Village If you have lost your Clash of Clans account or village by losing a phone, getting it stolen, broke, uninstalling the game or doing a factory data reset and did not have it backed up, only the support team can help you. Start the game, hit settings, and press “Help & Support” to get started. Users can also proceed by contacting Clash of Clans support here. Head to Help & Support, and tap the “Start a conversation” button on the top right. This will connect you with Supercell support, and they can try and track down and find your lost account. Having a unique name makes this easier. The following information will be needed to find a lost village: Name of the lost village Name of the clan the lost village is a part of (to help track it down) Town Hall level of your lost village Last date & time played Player level in village (if available) Provide all the details you possibly can, do not delete the pre-populated information on the lost village page, and Supercell may be able to find and restore your village. If you lost the village on iOS for any reason and didn’t have it backed up to Game center, the same steps as above will be required. Depending on the uniqueness of the name, clan name, and available information Supercell support should be able to find and restore your village. If the Clan name is “Clash of Clans” or something generic, where thousands of others used the same, it may be more difficult. Always have a unique player and clan name. Fix for “Link Error 102” Sometimes users may run into an odd “link error 102” while trying to play or transfer Clash of Clans using the device link code. In order for the link to work often-times both devices need to be connected to the same internet connection. Meaning connect both the old and new device to the same WiFi connection at home, or a public WiFi hotspot like at Starbucks. If one device is a smartphone, and you don’t have WiFi, tether the internet connection in and connect your tablet or the other device to the original, so they’re on the same network, and retry the link code. If this still fails, try another wireless network. Connect both devices to a friends wireless network, a public library, Starbucks, or AT&T WiFi spots around many cities. If this still fails, use the in-game support tab mentioned above and answer all of Supercell’s questions, and a support member may be able to resolve the issue. How to Change Your Name Changing your name in Clash of Clans was nearly impossible until an update to the game back in April of 2015. In April Clash of Clans received an update with tons of new features, as well as the option to change your in-game name once. This can only be done for Town Hall level 5 and above. Read: How to Change Your Name in Clash of Clans While on the regular home area looking at your base, tap the 3-gears shaped button near the bottom right of the screen. Then tap “Settings” and select the “Change Name” button. A box will pop-up instructing the user to change their name, but you will be warned this can only be done once. And one time only. Now that Clash of Clans has this as an option, you can only do it once. So choose wisely. Simply enter the new name you’d like to enjoy during gameplay, and select continue. You’ll be prompted to write it again confirming it’s what you want, then a third confirmation page will make you write CONFIRM in all caps. This is to ensure this is the name you want to use, and users will once again be reminded this is their one and only name change. If for whatever reason you’d like to change it again, you probably can’t, but emailing support with a valid reason the staff may grant users a second chance. This won’t be as easy, but it is possible. Gem Purchase Didn’t Come Through While most in-game purchases for things like gems goes extremely smooth, occasionally Android and iOS users will have problems. Sometimes the Android, Apple, or Supercell servers may respond slowly, return an error, or fail. If this is the case users are recommended to wait a few minutes, check their email to see if it went through. If the purchase was accepted, wait a few minutes and the purchase should show up. Try closing the game and restarting it. And the gems should arrive. Gem hacks typically don’t work, and those with a jailbroken iPhone can sometimes cause other issues. If a purchase isn’t received within 24 hours, contact the Google Play Store or iTunes for a refund. Supercell cannot verify a purchase if it doesn’t clear, so users need to request a refund through the app store. Click here for more details. On Android the process is easier, and if you received an email that you bought gems, the same in-game support tab should usually resolve the issue. Gems Disappeared Gems don’t just disappear in Clash of Clans. The only way for them to be gone, is if they’re used. Meaning buying a shield, a builders hut, boosting, spending gems on gold, elixir or dark elixir, or speeding up building or troop upgrades. If gems are used accidentally by friends, family members, or children, too bad. Supercell cannot or will not refund gems that are accidentally used. However, if a purchase or connection problem caused lost gems, try the step mentioned above, or contact support. Can’t Find A Clan in Search Searching for a Clan in Clash of Clans can be challenging, simply because there are millions of players. Open the game, and hit the blue “i” button by your name near the top left. Then select “search clans“. If you can’t find the clan in search it’s because the name wasn’t original, and too many others used the same name. Make sure you know the clan name, badge design and colors. Even the Clan War level can help you find the right one. How to Play on Android and iPhone Yes, you can play the same Clash of Clans village on both platforms. Playing Clash of Clans on your iPhone, but also want to play it at home on your Samsung Galaxy Tab or Nexus 7? Here’s how: To play the same village on two different devices that aren’t both Android or iPhone, uses the same steps as above. Use the link code instructions above and transfer your iPhone Clash of Clans village to a new device, which can be an Android device. Your village will still be accessible on both devices. Again, always sync to Game Center or Google+ to save progress. Other Clash of Clans Problems Overall there aren’t too many issues in Clash of Clans. It’s one of the most popular, stable, and best games on Android or iOS. While most of the issues users face have been detailed above, if you have any other issues head to the Clash of Clans support forum. If the game isn’t loading try rebooting your phone. If updates are failing try closing the game, closing apps like the App Store or Google Play, re-opening, and trying again. Typically these are all connection issues, not related to Clash itself. Slow load times, searching in matchmaking and other things are often based on connection, base layout, and other variables. If you have any other problems hit the link above and ask someone on the official forums, try the in-game support system, or drop us a comment below. 66 Responses 12/04/2015 Salinajhone Reply 15 my best friend’s step-sister makes $62 every hour on the laptop .

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Google Play Music now integrated with Google Home By Ida Torres - February 13, 2017 10 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter As Google Home continues to compete with Amazon’s own smart Bluetooth speakers Echo and Echo Tap, it only makes sense that it integrates more Google products to make it even more of a powerhouse. Music streaming service Google Play Music is now even more integrated into the speaker’s system to make it easier for you to play music, even when your hands are fully occupied, using a wide variety of voice commands to get the music just right. Google Play Music not just gives you songs, albums and artists that you want to play on demand. It uses machine learning on all your past activity, as well as weather, activity, and location to create playlists for you that will be appropriate for whatever it is you’re doing. You simply have to say “Ok Google, play some music, and hopefully, it will be smart enough to get you the right kind of music. If you want to be more specific, you can say something like “Ok Google, play music for cooking” or “Ok Google, play some relaxing music.” Google Assistant is of course integrated into Google Home as well, so you can also ask it some questions related to the song that’s playing. You can say “Ok Google, who’s singing this song?” or “Ok Google, from what album is that song playing?” You can also ask it to turn up or turn down the music and even give it a thumbs up. If you don’t like the current song that’s playing, you can ask Google Assistant to play something else. If you buy a Google Home device now until February 27, you’ll get 6 months free Google Play Music subscription, only if you’re a new user. And if you buy it together with a Chromecast, you get $15 off. To celebrate this integration, they’re throwing a block party in Los Angeles (February 11-12) and New York (February 24-26).

It must evolve quickly to stay on top of the algorithm updates released by Google’s never-resting R&D team. Neither digital marketers nor SEO professionals are machines who can easily upload and process dozens of GBs of data. We are humans, and it takes us time to research, learn, and adapt new promotion and optimization techniques to our everyday processes. It is difficult, so many prefer to stay inside their comfort zones until Google hits really hard. In this article, I’m not going to challenge you to leave your safe SEO waters. What I’m going to do, though, is dig deeper into the history of search engine optimization and cover old school off-page optimization methods, which will definitely get your site penalized by Google today. So, let’s start our time machine and get going! #1 Link Building with “Rented” Paid Links Nowadays, paid links are strictly forbidden by Google. However, once upon a time, link purchasing was the lifeblood of black- and grey-hat SEO. It was effective and cost-efficient. Their off-page optimization strategy was pretty straightforward: Buy backlinks in bulk Stuff your site with those links Wait until SERPs improve Only battle-scarred SEO-veterans know that there were different types of paid links. To name a few: Automatically generated links Permanent links Link spam (from blogs, forums, and comment sections) Bookmark links Signature links Yet, so-called “rented” links were undoubtedly leading this soon-to-be-banished crowd. What is link renting, then? Basically, “rented” or brokered paid links are links that you use for a limited period of time. When your “rent period” is over, you can either rent the links again or they’ll go back on the market for other SEO ninjas to purchase and use them for their sites. You may ask: “Why would I pay for links that will be taken away from my site in a month or two?” If this is your question, you may not know how websites were optimized before the Panda and Penguin algorithm updates. The blunt truth is: Link renting was perfect for earning money. If you were an SEO, of course. Let’s say you have a site to optimize and promote. You suggest that your client purchase “rented” links because they get high ranking on Google. Obviously, the client agrees to pay. Then, you stuff your client’s web pages and content with these links, and the site enjoys impressive SERPs… until your link package expires and is sold to another SEO pro. The client pays for links once more, and you continue to get paid as you optimize the site one more time. Nobody works for free, right? Obviously, this can be seen as cheating. SEO pros could keep their clients on a tight leash, making sure that they would never get rankings high enough to stop investing in links. For the better, Google put a stop to that kind of cheating. Remember: Link purchasing and link renting are (and were) illegitimate off-page optimization practices. If you ever get caught buying or renting links from webmasters or link farms, your links will be devalued and your site — penalized. #2 Use of Paid Permanent Links Here’s when we should have a closer look at off-page optimization in the 2000’s. Basically, there were two battling houses: House “Rented” Paid Links, which I mentioned above, and House Paid Permanent Links. The lesser houses answered directly to those two. The followers of House Paid Permanent Links believed in “high-quality search engine optimization” (Yeah, that’s what they called it). By high-quality, they meant that “rented” links were not an option. Instead, they focused on purchasing paid permalinks: links that you pay for once and use permanently. To tell the truth, House Paid Permanent Links was a much nobler house than House “Rented” Paid Links. It was against cheating clients and did their best to optimize sites well. The only problem being paid permanent links are as forbidden as temporarily “rented” links. Remember: If you ever come upon an article that praises permanent links (there were plenty of those in the 2000’s), don’t read it. Or, analyze it as a historical document, but don’t follow it’s instructions. Paid permanent links are a no-no. #3 Automatic Link Purchase and Generation I personally consider this to be one of the most disgusting off-page optimization methods that has ever been used in the SEO community. Just imagine: You don’t need to create content, optimize on-page factors, or make your site mobile- and user-friendly; your only goal is to automatically generate or buy links from third-party services. More links, higher SERPs. Many SEO professionals understood that automatic links were no good, but, nonetheless, kept buying and generating them en masse, using such services as Rookie, SEO Hammer, and WebEffector. Automatically-generated links were cheap, efficient, and tempting. Only the bravest could resist the allure of doing SEO so easily. Of course, both automatically-purchased and automatically-generated links are no longer a safe option. Some black- and grey-hat SEOs still use them, though. They trick Google by pushing these links onto sites gradually and systematically. But you don’t want to be that kind of an SEO professional, I hope. Remember:  Automatic links are the fastest way to fall from Google’s top results. Use them and you will be harshly penalized. So, just stay away from services that offer “Magnificent link building results for $5 per package of high-quality, automatically-generated links!” They never work! #4 Link Spamming via Bookmark Services To remember this method, you might be old enough to remember the times of “old” sites. By “old” sites, I mean sites that weren’t convenient to use. Let’s imagine you have read a really interesting, useful, and valuable article on SEJ. What are you going to do next? Well, most likely you will share it on your social networks with social sharing buttons, right? The only problem is, with old sites, you didn’t have any social buttons. For real. If you enjoyed reading or watching anything, you had to copy a link and paste it into Twitter or Facebook. Needless to say, “old” sites weren’t user-friendly. However, while users struggled, SEO flourished. Social links were as valued as regular, organic links. You could easily build dozens of backlinks by sharing content from your site and blog and it didn’t take much time at all. All you had to do was rely on such tools as Digg, StumbleUpon, Delicious, and URL.org for mass sharing. These sites are social bookmarking services. Users used them to keep, share, and discover content. The services themselves weren’t cheesy, but SEO professionals harnessed them to trick the system. Because social links had similar link juice to organic links, SEOs felt free to abuse bookmarks and spam social networks with links. Surely, Google had to act quickly to put an end to this easy-cheesy link building method that flooded each and every social network with junk bookmarks. Remember: Don’t use social bookmarks to spam links from your site. First off, they are no longer as important to your SERPs as they used to be. Second, Google detects spam with no problem. So, if you don’t want your site to get penalized, concentrate on building links through natural methods like creating, posting, and sharing high-quality content. #5 Creation of Microsites, Satellites, PBNs Links are still essential to the progress and growth of any website. Years ago, the situation was even worse, though: Link quality mattered more than link quantity, but it wasn’t obvious. SEOs quickly came to the conclusion that: If links are so important, why should I rely on link farms that sell low-quality, junk links? I can build and drive links on my own. All I need is to create a network of microsites and satellites that pass their link juice to my home site. The idea of owning private blog networks (PBNs) was so tempting that, even today, some black-hat SEO pros risk it. Here are some “fruits” to owning a PBN: Full control over links Easy adjustment and edits of anchor texts Free link juice from newly acquired domains (when they are high-quality). Anyway, the idea behind microsites, satellites, and PBNs is simple: You, not Google, influence your home website ranking position in search. Yet, with great power comes great responsibility. Google’s penalty is inevitable if any factor (flagged IPs, penalized domains, similar anchor texts, thin content) suggests that your site has anything to do with this forbidden technique. Remember: Use of microsites, satellites, and private blog networks must be out of the question for you. Follow this advice if your reputation means anything to you. Beware! #6 Link Spamming in Directories and Listings Before Google came into power, multiple directories and listings (i.e. Yahoo) ruled the Web. Basically, if you needed to look up anything in search, you typed in, say, “Yahoo” and scrolled through thousands of links and ads. Not very convenient. Google dominates search now, but directories and listings are still alive and kicking. They are hardly as popular as they once were, but they are still considered, by many, to be a viable source of high-quality backlinks. There’s nothing wrong with listing your company on Yellow Pages, Yelp, Citysearch, or Angie’s List, but remember: Directories and listings were once heavily abused by black-, grey-, and even white-hat SEO experts. Similar to social links, links from all directories and listings were useful for SEO. As a result, the Web was flooded with thousands of low-quality directories that nobody, except search crawlers, ever accessed. Today, if you want to register on any directory, you should research your niche, sift out trustworthy directories, write and add unique descriptions to your directory listings, and upload visually appealing images. Back then, all you needed to do was purchase XRumer, the king of spammy services. It was used to: Scan a targeted niche to detect directories and listings Generate multiple descriptions for selected directories Register on selected directories Upload descriptions to finish account creation. Basically, having XRumer and a single description was enough to generate thousands of links. In most cases, the links weren’t perfect, but they still worked nicely to boost SERPs. This technique was widely used until Google started to prioritize quality over quantity. When Google Penguin devalued tons of low-quality links, spammy linking backfired, dropping ranking positions for about 3% of total queries. Remember: Directories and listings should be used to cement your site’s authoritative position in local search. However, link spamming should be avoided at all costs. You are better off registering your site on 10 high-quality directories than spamming it on thousands of low-quality, junk ones. Spamming equals to lower rankings. Always. #7 Automatic Link Posting on Blogs and Forums This old school SEO practice is basically a twin brother of the previously mentioned one. Links from blogs, forums, and associated comments used to be indexed as organic ones. Outsource companies employed hundreds of “professionals” to spread spammy comments. As a result, blogs and forums quickly turned into a mess. But that was only the half of it. To generate and post comments, the infamous XRumer was used, too. It worked like this: type a comment into XRumer → wait until it scans the Web for matching blogs and forums → click a button to start generating comment copies → autopost pre-generated comments onto selected blogs and forums. XRumer registered your personas, so manual operations were reduced to a minimum. You could build dozens of backlinks without any fine tuning or polishing of your site, content, usability, conversion forms, etc. Automatic link posting on blogs and forums was so popular that it became a daily routine. You could easily purchase, generate, and automatically post thousands of links, every day. And, to tell the truth, only a few could stand out of that sea of sameness. Google no longer takes blog- and forum-related links into account. Yet, blogs and forums are still a viable source of links. Even if these links (and associated comments) don’t help you get better SERPs, they drive targeted traffic, increase awareness, and build reputation. Remember: Blogs and forums are effective to target audiences in specific industries (e.g. health, beauty, wellness, cosmetology). Leaving a link or two that lead to your products and services is always helpful, but don’t step out of the line. You can be harshly punished for spamming. #8 Purchase of Forum Signature Links This technique is a genius one. Imagine that you are desperate for money, and a bold thought strikes your mind: What about creating multiple accounts on blogs, leaving thousands of comments on these blogs, and then selling link space? The logic is simple: All blog links are as juicy as organic ones. The more comments I post, the more links I will potentially generate for someone who is going to pay me for them. Brilliant. Today, signature links can be used for awareness purposes. However, in some cases, they can significantly drop SERPs (if a blog is deemed low-trust). I wouldn’t recommend using these type of links, at all. Remember: Once, signature links could cost dozens of dollars per account. Nowadays, this practice is likely to get your site penalized rather than have any positive effect on its ranking. So, they are a no-no. Conclusion Having read this article, you might think: “SEO of the good old days was actually terrible. You had to buy links and push your way through with manipulative techniques.” I’m not going to argue with that. Indeed, many SEO practices of the past are forbidden now. However, if you look at it from a different perspective, you paid for what you got. The more you paid for links, the higher ranking position you came away within search results. Today, it is quite another story. We don’t definitively know how Google works, and search algorithms are so smart that you have to play by their rules. SEO has become much more complex than it used to be. It has evolved into search engine marketing (SEM), but that isn’t a bad thing. It makes us strategize and adjust to the new realities of search.

Reuters/Beck Diefenbach Google Pixel and Pixel XL are currently two of the top smartphones in the world. Google is no longer the company known for its software but a major player in the smartphone segment. The company’s operating system has enabled a number of players to make big bucks and now Google wants to be in the game. News of Google Pixel 2 is already making rounds. But also in the game is Huawei. The company launched the Honor 6X at the CES 2017 in Las Vegas. It will be interesting to see how the smartphone fares against the Google Pixel XL. According to CRN, the Google Pixel XL comes with Android 7.1 Nougat, the latest OS from Google whereas the Huawei Honor 6X has the Android 6.0. It has a customised Android user interface known as EMUI that brings a simpler design style than standard Android. However, Honor 6X comes with EMUI 4.1 and not the latest 5.0. Updates are expected though in the second quarter. The Pixxel XL of course has the Google Assistant, probably the best personal digital assistant in the market currently. While both Google Pixel XL and Huawei Honor 6X have 5.5-inch screens, they also come in aluminium bodies. The overall size is more or less the same for two. However, when it comes to display resolution, Pixel XL has a sharper display with a screen resolution of 2,560 x 1,440 pixels, compared to Huawei Honor 6X’s 1,920 x 1,080 pixels. In terms of processor, both the companies turn to different manufacturers but end up roughly the same when it comes to clock speed. The Huawei Honor 6X has a Kirin 655 chipset clocked at 2.1GHz while the Pixel XL sports a Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 processor, clocked at 2.15GHz, which is a bit faster than Huawei’s smartphone. While both the companies have promoted their smartphone cameras greatly, Pixel XL is said to have the best camera currently in the market. According to GSMArena, the Google Pixel XL has a 12.3MP primary camera with f/2.0, EIS (gyro), phase detection & laser autofocus and dual-LED (dual tone) flash. Other Pixel XL primary camera features include 1/2.3" sensor size, 1.55µm pixel size, geo-tagging, touch focus, face detection, HDR and panorama. It can capture videos at 2160p@30fps, 1080p@30/60/120fps and 720p@240fps. The secondary camera is of 8MP with features such as f/2.4, 1/3.2" sensor size, 1.4 µm pixel size and 1080p video recording. The Huawei Honor 6X has a dual 12 MP + 2 MP primary camera with phase detection autofocus and LED flash. Other features include 1/2.9" sensor size, 1.25 µm pixel size, geo-tagging, touch focus, face detection, HDR and panorama. It can record 1080p videos @30fps and has a 1080p capable 8MP secondary camera. The Google Pixel XL has a larger battery, a non-removable Li-Ion 3,450 mAh battery whereas the Huawei Honor 6X packs a non-removable 3,340 mAh battery. Another area where Google scores is the free, unlimited cloud storage in Pixel XL. It also comes with a 4GB RAM and 32/128GB internal storage options. Huawei Honor 6X packs a 3GB RAM for its 32GB Model and 4GB RAM for its 64GB model. The biggest difference between the two smartphones is in their price. The Huawei Honor 6X 32GB variant is available for US$249.99 (AU$330 approx). The Google Pixel XL has a starting price of US$769 (AU$1,000 approx).

By Liam Tung | February 13, 2017 -- 11:47 GMT (03:47 PST) | Topic: Enterprise Software Oracle is now arguing it's entitled to a new trial because the district court "repeatedly undermined its case" against Google. Image: James Martin/CNET Oracle is appealing last year's ruling that Google's use of Java APIs in Android constituted "fair use". Oracle vowed to appeal Google's win last May and on Friday filed that action at the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which in 2014 ruled that APIs can be copyrighted. Google's victory over Oracle: A win for developers The ruling sets a high bar for the level of "creativity" that APIs may need to show before they deserve protection under copyright law. Read More Google last year convinced a district court jury that its use of 37 Java APIs met fair-use conditions, allowing it to dodge Oracle's $9bn claim. Oracle now argues it's entitled to a new trial because the district court "repeatedly undermined Oracle's case", leading the jury to make the wrong decision. For example, it says the court wrongly bought Google's claim that Android was limited to smartphones while Java was for PCs, whereas Oracle contends that Java and Android both compete as platforms for smart TVs, cars, and wearables. "The district court barred all evidence of Google's competition in any market other than smartphones and tablets," write Oracle's lawyers. "This evidence would have eviscerated Google's theory of 'transformative' use, the core of its fair-use defense," they argue. Oracle is accusing Google of "classic unfair use", where a "plagiarist takes the most recognizable portions of a novel and adapts them into a film". "Google copied thousands of lines of copyrighted code from Oracle's Java programming platform. Google concedes it put that code to the same use in the competing Android platform, for what this Court already has deemed 'entirely commercial' purposes. And Google reaped billions of dollars while leaving Oracle's Java business in tatters," Oracle's lawyers say in the brief obtained by The Register. Oracle's bid for a new trial at the US District Court for the Northern District of California was knocked back in September. Oracle said it deserved a new trial because Google "completely concealed the ARC++ project" to bring Android apps to Chrome OS hardware.

Here's how you can still play the brilliant puzzler, which sees players control a pangolin, racing around a maze to collect items. Here's how to find the game on a desktop, smartphone, or tablet. By Aaron Brown Aaron Brown PUBLISHED: 09:13, Thu, Feb 16, 2017 | UPDATED: 09:13, Thu, Feb 16, 2017 GOOGLE • GETTYFor its latest Doodle, Google has unveiled a Valentine's Day themed mini game Google rolled-out a new Google Doodle for Valentine's Day 2017. Themed around the day of love, the latest Google Doodle took over the US search engine's homepage in a number of countries across the globe, including Canada, United States, Argentina, Australia, France, UK and more. The addictive interactive game sees players control a pangolin, as he races around a complicated maze of platforms to collect items for his Valentine's. There are four levels in total, with three minutes gameplay allocated for each level, and each prefaced with a animated cut scene. On desktop and laptop computers, players have to use the arrow keys to navigate, with the Space Bar used to make the pangolin to jump. Meanwhile, those on mobile devices, like the iPhone 7 or Google Pixel, will see two virtual arrow keys appear in the game, as well as a dedicated jump button. Holding or tapping on these will move the character. GOOGLEThe latest Google Doodle highlights the plight of the endangered pangolin For its latest Doodle, which is almost as addictive as this Dinosaur one, Google worked in collaboration with World Wildlife Fund to help spread awareness about the pangolin. "Pangolins are the most trafficked mammal in the world, and all 8 species face a significant threat from poachers and smugglers," Google posted on its blog. "Check out the World Wildlife Fund to learn more about the the pangolin’s plight and to support WWF’s efforts to save the pangolin and other endangered species." WHAT IS A PANGOLIN? GOOGLE • APPLEYou can play the Valentine's Day themed mini game on smartphones and tablets Google also includes a link so players can donate to the cause and help the plight of the pangolins. The easiest way to launch the game is to head to the Google homepage – Google.co.uk – and hit the play symbol. However, those who missed-out on the Google homepage game on Valentine's Day itself are still able to play. Google archives its Doodles in a dedicated blog, click here to play the 2017 Valentine's Day Doodle game on your iOS or Android device.

The IMF is reluctant to take part in a further bailout without further debt relief, but this is opposed by Greece’s European creditors. Fitch said: “Recent events highlight that political risk remains a sovereign rating weakness for Greece, despite positive economic and fiscal developments.” The agency pointed out that Greece faced payments of more than €6bn in July, including €3.9bn to the European Central Bank. But it said: “Greece has broadly met programme conditions and recorded a primary surplus of €4.4bn in 2016 thanks to higher-than-budgeted revenues. GDP rose 1.8% year on year in the third quarter of 2016, the largest annual increase in over eight years. This progress is one reason that we think Greece’s European creditors would be prepared to proceed with the second review and to disburse funds without IMF involvement. Another reason is their desire to avoid a Greek political crisis during an already congested election year in Europe. “Completing the second programme review and disbursing the associated ESM funds would enable Greece to meet its July maturities... Doing so in a timely fashion and avoiding the level of brinksmanship of the first half of 2015 would reduce the risk that Greece’s economic recovery is undermined by a hit to confidence or by the Greek government building up arrears to conserve liquidity.” Fitch is due to review Greece’s CCC rating on 24 February.

Steve Mnuchin [who spent 17 years at the investment bank] is in the final hours of his confirmation as Treasury secretary. He is expected to be confirmed around 7pm EST Monday. Donald Trump’s agenda of financial deregulation will likely have another supporter in the form Mnuchin. Mnuchin and Gary Cohn will be a more ‘internationalist’ influence on Trump, potentially putting a lid the President’s penchant for currency wars and trade tariffs. The benefit to Wall Street of having an ex-Goldman Sachs banker as Treasury Secretary is pretty self-evident. In extension, it would make sense for Mnuchin to fill key positions at the treasury with his people, namely other Wall Streeters. Senior Goldman Sachs banker Jim Donovan as well as Justin Muzinich, a former Morgan Stanley worker are reportedly being considered for key positions.

The raised growth forecasts from the European Union have helped sentiment, but it is the return of the Trump bounce following a lull which is pushing markets higher again. The president’s positive meeting with Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe has helped the upbeat mood, while mining shares are benefiting from the prospect of Trump’s infrastructure plans as well as capacity concerns after a strike at a BHP Billiton copper mine in Chile.

The report for the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium has noted that the shop vacancy rate is now at its lowest since 2011 in the depth of the recession.But the rate of empty premises has only fallen by 0.5 per cent in the last three months. Overall the vacancy rate in terms of shops in Northern Ireland - 14 per cent - remains the highest of any area of the UK. Aodhan Connolly, director of the Northern Ireland Consortium, while accentuating the positive from the slight call in shop vacancy rates, also issued a warning about Brexit’s impact on local consumers. Connolly said that once a new power sharing executive is formed after the Assembly elections on 2 March, the next regional government must “put the consumer first during the Brexit negotiations.” He said that with Northern Irish households having only half the spending power of their counterparts in Britain the next devolved government must “make the case for tariff free trade” in order to continue “keeping show prices low once the UK leaves the European Union.” Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 9.10am EST 09:10 Greek central banker: Bailout talks at critical phase Photograph: Louisa Gouliamaki/AFP/Getty Images Greece’s central bank chief has now weighed in, warning MPs that the Greek bailout talks must be concluded quickly, before the economy is hurt by the uncertainty. Yannis Stournaras told the Athens parliament’s economic affairs committee that time was running out, so both sides should make concessions to get a deal done. Stournaras (who was finance minister in an earlier phase of the Greek crisis), said: “Bailout review talks are at a very critical phase. The economy’s positive momentum must be assured by the swift conclusion of the review. “Conditions could be much worse later, it may be too late.” This uncertainty is hitting Greek bonds today, pushing the yield (or interest rate) on two-year debt back over 9% - a dangerously high level.

In a strongly-worded interview this morning the interior minister, Panos Skourletis, insisted that the leftist-led government would not put its signature to an agreement that would doom Greece to a permanent debt deflationary cycle. Warning that the European Union “might not exist in a few years” Skourletis told the leftist Syntaktwn newspaper: “An agreement that prolongs this state of uncertainty, that impedes growth and recycles recession cannot be accepted … no one can be sure if the European Union will exist in a few years.” Growing opposition to fresh austerity measures from the ruling Syriza’s party base dominated a meeting of Syriza’s executive committee at the weekend. Under pressure to step up resistance to calls for further pension cuts and tax increases, prime minister Alexis Tsipras used the opportunity to urge German chancellor Angela Merkel to rein in her finance minister Wolfgang Schauble accusing him of plotting to create a two-speed euro zone. Speaking to the Guardian, the Syriza MP Hara Karafanti said Greece was paying the price of the ongoing spat between the IMF and EU over how to deal with the country. She also believes that Fund’s demands for fresh cuts are based on a false and outdated assessment of the Greek economy. Karafanti said: “The demand for more measures is a result of the confusion that currently prevails between the creditor institutions....

Today’s EC forecasts and the re-emergence of the ‘Trump trade’ have pushed the Stoxx 600 index to its highest level since December 2015. Photograph: Thomson Reuters Mining shares are still showing solid gains, helped by predictions that the US government’s promise of tax reforms will spur growth. Consumer goods firms, tech companies and industrial corporations are also leading the risers. Relief that Trump and Abe’s summit appears to have gone well are also pushing shares higher. But the optimism feels shaky, and could unravel if Trump doesn’t deliver on his tax pledges. Mihir Kapadia, CEO of Sun Global Investments, explains: “It’s been a relatively incident-free end to the week at the White House and thus the markets are starting off the Monday on a positive note further to the bilateral discussions between the heads of states of the US and Japan. While the US dollar has strengthened against the Yen over the backdrop of a cordial visit from Prime Minister Abe of Japan, the markets are cautious on what is oncoming within the next few weeks as president Trump promised to announce something “phenomenal” on the tax front. This is likely to be on Tax reforms and infrastructure spending, but considering he needs approval from Congress, the feasibility of fruition is still being questioned. If for instance the infrastructure spending aren’t approved, we may see a disappointed market bringing down the US dollar which continues to be strong despite the bumps and controversies caused by the Trump presidency.” Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 6.27am EST 06:27 During questions on today’s forecasts, Pierre Moscovici warned that the European project would be imperilled if Marine Le Pen wins the French presidency: Danny Kemp (@dannyctkemp) EU's @Moscovici on Le Pen plans: 'would be a tragedy for the euro, catastrophe for France, in a way the end of the European project' February 13, 2017 Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 6.03am EST 06:03 The key takeaway from today’s European growth forecasts is that every member of the EU is expected to grow steadily from 2016 to 2018.

Could a full buyout be close at hand?

And in the case of Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL), it’s what drives its profits, cash flows and ultimately the value of its stock. Google has made a name for itself delving into people’s lives, running it through an algorithm and selling the output to advertisers. Pretty much everything GOOGL stock does — even controlling your thermostat — has to do with creating this huge base of data for the company to play with. Source: Shutterstock And its latest, and somewhat secret moves are all about getting its hands another massive pile of people’s lives. Google is buying floundering social media network Twitter Inc (NYSE:TWTR). Well, not entirely. But GOOGL has started picking off pieces of the Twitter corpse. And by snagging some of TWTR’s items now, Alphabet could be setting itself up for to buy the whole enchilada later on. In the end, that actually might be a great deal for GOOGL stock investors as its all about the data. GOOGL Snags Developer Tools Twitter has been a potential buyout candidate basically the second it IPO’d a few years ago. Perhaps even more so now that the social network has struggled to see user growth and profitability. TWTR stock has plunged about 60% since its public offering. But like Google, Twitter is much more than just its namesake service. In this case, it’s about app development. For an undisclosed sum, Alphabet has agreed to buyout Twitter’s main developer project — Fabric. Fabric provides a software toolkit for development and design of mobile apps. And even though it’s part of Twitter, it’s not small potatoes. The software is used by more than 580,000 mobile developers including Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (NASDAQ:BABA) and Wal-Mart Stores Inc’s (NYSE:WMT) Jet.com. Fabric will be folded into Google’s own Firebase mobile developer platform, and its employees will be now part of Alphabet. So why would the company want this stuff and the talent pool? As I said, it’s all about data. With the addition of Fabric, GOOGL will own two of the most popular tools for developing mobile apps. Fabric is a favorite stomping ground for app development for Apple Inc.’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) iOS software for iPhones/iPads. By having the two under one umbrella, it gives Alphabet an easy inroad to help developers make formerly exclusive iPhone apps available for the mobile web and Google’s Android software. You know, where GOOGL stock makes a bulk of its advertising dollars. The second big data kicker comes from the fact that while much of Google’s tools are available for free; many developers will buy computing power and storage from the company’s cloud service. It’s expected that once Fabric is integrated fully, the deal would be the same. Not only does that boost GOOGL’s cloud revenues, but it gives it a chance to comb through all the data being produced and potentially mine it for what it is worth. Backend as a service (BaaS) platforms like Fabric and Firebase fit perfectly into Google’s “Here, have it for free, we’ll just keep the data” business model. In the end, the purchase will allow Google to further cement itself as one of the world’s biggest mobile app developers and give it a new source of additional revenue.

Is it a social network, a media platform, a technology company? February 13, 2017 | Social Media Share Email Print As Facebook develops an ever-more diverse portfolio of businesses, questions arise of whether it risks diluting its core identity. Put another way, will the future of Facebook look like Google? Or, will it look more like Yahoo? Like both Yahoo and Google, Facebook has developed—and has invested in—a multitude of businesses that sometimes are only tangentially related to its core platform. At this point, Facebook has tested or continues to test ventures in ecommerce, payments, gaming, mobile messaging, virtual reality, set-top boxes and more. Sound familiar? It sounds a bit like Google, right? Google’s complex web of investments and new products ultimately led to the creation of a new holding company, Alphabet, whose dominant search business generates the vast majority of revenue, while other units remain intriguing, but largely revenue-neutral. On the flip side, it sounds a lot like Yahoo, too. Yahoo has been involved in virtually every digital aspect since it defined the concept of a portal. The products that Yahoo has acquired or created run to the hundreds—and its list of scuttled enterprises runs long, too. If identity is merely revenue momentum, then Facebook looks more like Google. Its Q4 2016 revenues soared more than 50%, while Alphabet’s surged 22%. At the same time, Yahoo’s revenues edged downward, after taking traffic acquisition costs into account. But if identity is more content-driven, then Facebook bears a distinct resemblance to Yahoo. Both companies found financial success based on building a massive audience—and then delivering display advertising to that audience. The difference may come down to utility vs. content. Tastes change, and content providers often have trouble keeping up. Utilities, on the other hand, are much less subject to the whims of taste. Consider email patterns, for example. Younger people are far more likely to use Gmail compared with baby boomers, who continue to use “older” platforms, according to Bluecore research. In that regard, Facebook is more like Google: Although it is a platform for viewing content, at a more fundamental level Facebook is a utility for maintaining relationships. And that makes it more difficult to discard. Consider Facebook usage among younger age groups. For years, experts have argued that teens would soon abandon Facebook. And for years, that has not been the case—teens continue to be very much active on Facebook. According to September 2016 data from Barkley and FutureCast, 77% of internet users ages 15 to 19 said they use Facebook. And they use it on a regular basis. UBS Evidence Lab found that daily user penetration among teen social media users reached 65% in 2016—a higher rate than seen in the past two years. “While teens may no longer love Facebook and certainly don’t see it as cool, it’s simply too useful for them not to use,” said eMarketer analyst Mark Dolliver. Meanwhile, audience size by itself is not an advantage for a pure content platform, but it confers a huge advantage for a utility. For example, a significant number of readers on a news site doesn’t necessarily create value for an individual user. But a significant number of searchers creates more accurate search results for an individual user. “Because of Facebook’s core function as a platform for connecting with almost anyone, its size really is a genuine advantage for each user,” said Dolliver. “In other words, in Facebook’s case, the fact of being so big is in itself a factor that will help it remain big.” That long-term advantage should give Facebook plenty of room to experiment with different identities. —Rimma Kats New in eMarketer PRO This Week Report: Marketing Technology 2017 Forecast Data: US Mobile Phone Usage Report: Retail Mcommerce in Germany Forecast Data: US Mcommerce Sales Report: Ad Spending in Southeast Asia Not a PRO subscriber?

Written by Guest author 3 days ago Telecoms.com periodically invites third party commentators to give us their verdict on the current state of play of the market. In this piece, Dean Anthony Gratton writes about his expectations ahead of Mobile World Congress 2017. So, CES has passed – did anyone notice or was it just me? Yep, that’s right! Another year filled with lacklustre malarkey, probably at the expense of those who attended, right? Piquing interest with rumours I don’t necessarily want to be the harbinger of sombre news but, short of new displays and the surfacing of augmented and virtual reality cupcakes, nothing else happened, which leads me quite nicely to this year’s Mobile World Congress (MWC) in Barcelona where, I hope, we’ll see a lot more singing and dancing! I’m not sure how far I should stretch out my ‘mystic meg’ stick here (eesh, awkward!) but, anyway, let’s start with the rumours surrounding Microsoft. Whether purely idle insider mutterings, industry gossip or yet more fake news, I have to admit to looking forward to the alleged announcement of Microsoft’s new Surface Phone – I so, so hope it’s true! In contrast, Apple won’t give a rat’s arse because, well they’re Apple aren’t they and the world must simply listen and obey – ironic really, since their 1984 advert junked the norm with their vision of an Orwellian-themed future. That said, leaked images of their new iPhone 8 (*yawn) have already populated a multitude of technology news websites. Coincidence? Perhaps not! Who are the usual suspects? So, who can we expect to showcase their new bling this year? Well, Google have to undoubtedly make an appearance, since their first-generation Pixel seems to be in desperate need of an update, according to numerous reports. I’m sure you already know that, in the case of Google, its first-generation product bolstered early adoptors who, in turn, fuelled the ethos for others to adopt the Google brand, whilst financing the Pixel second generation. As such, we can surely expect a much-improved model and, dare I say, a ‘Pixel 2’. The ‘Meh’ crowd Scratching my head now – who else? Erm, well… Samsung, of course! No surprises here, I guess, since we have already been privy to the Galaxy S8 in some supposedly leaked video – yeah, right! In fairness to Samsung, they have shaken off the copycat label and have found their own niche, which is a good thing, although the choice of an exploding Samsung Galaxy Note 7 in GTA 5 was hilarious! We have been assured by Samsung that the issue has been resolved and it is business as usual. But then you have, if you like, the ‘Z-lister’ line-up: You know, the likes of LG, Sony, Philips and Alcatel, that is, companies you don’t ordinarily associate with a smartphone or tablet. Yep, ‘blah’ – there, I’ve said it, ‘Meh’! Yes, I am guilty of being attracted to the popular phone or tablet but, that being said, I do have a Microsoft Lumia 950XL, which is riskily signed up to the Windows Insider programme. Yep, so making and receiving calls and sending texts are made on a ‘trial and error’ basis. Until next time… Now HTC, on the other hand, you know, the same manufacturer of Google’s Pixel has been unusually quiet of late. Yes, I have that burning, itchy feeling (don’t go there) that something might be revealed – so my sources say! And, Huawei, for that matter (try pronouncing that after a few glasses of red!) might ripple the water with some announcements at this year’s congress. Huawei is the largest telecommunications equipment manufacturer and they also manufacture smartphones, including the Mate 9 and the P series, as well as the Media Pad. Again, rumours are circulating, suggesting Huawei will announce their next generation smartphone, the P10, at this year’s MWC. In recent news, it was reported that Apple are somewhat nervous of Huawei’s feature packed smartphone, which has piqued my interest, so I shall be taking exhaustive notes! So, how exactly will I be taking notes? Well, all is not lost since I will have first-hand access to all the shenanigans at this year’s MWC as I will be attending – Ha! Yes, I shall be roaming the aisles with an all-knowing insight; shimmying with the people that know a thing or two and rubbing shoulders with the people that matter in order to report my findings in next month’s column! So, this is where a ‘fedora-wearing’ Dr G signs off. Dr Dean Anthony Gratton is a bestselling author and columnist, and has worked extensively within the wireless communications R&D industry. His wireless research work has been patented. You can contact Dean via his website, and follow him on Twitter (@grattonboy) to enjoy his risqué humour, witty shenanigans, social media and technology-related tweets.

Google’s Valentine’s Day-themed Doodle game is a tribute to the world's most-trafficked animal Rob Price Feb. 13, 2017, 6:06 AM 21,628 facebook linkedin twitter email print The pangolin is the most-trafficked mammal in the world.Google Google on Monday unveiled its latest Valentine's Day-themed Google Doodle, which is also an interactive game that is for a good cause. In the game, the player controls a lovestruck pangolin to raise awareness of conservation efforts for the endangered critter. Because of their unique scales, pangolins are the most-trafficked animals in the world, prized for their pelts and their use in pseudo-scientific folk medicine. Google software engineer Jordan Thompson wrote in a blog post that "we hope that by playing this Doodle game, you can learn a bit more about these wonderful creatures."  The search giant is urging people to help the plight of the pangolin by donating and supporting the World Wildlife Foundation, or WWF. Google.org, the charitable arm of Google, also gave a grant to the WWF in 2016 that went toward protecting pangolin habitats from poachers. So what's the game actually like? Keep scrolling... View As: One Page Slides Here's the Google Doodle that was released for Valentine's Day. It becomes an interactive game when you click the Doodle. Google Basically, it's "Sonic the Hedgehog" with pangolins. It's pretty fun. You control a pangolin learning to bake, create music, and build flower bouquets to impress its sweetheart. Google On each of the four levels, you roll around at high speeds trying to collect tokens and get to the end before the time runs out. Google In the Google Doodle, pangolins are stylised in dashing purple, pink, and yellow colours — but in real life they look like this. 2630ben/Shutterstock Their scales make them highly-prized by poachers and animal traffickers. "There are eight species of pangolin, four each in Asia and Africa, and all are under threat, including two species listed as Critically Endangered," the WWF says. "Pangolin populations have been devastated by poaching, including at least 80 percent of pangolins in Asia." A pangolin skin is displayed amongst other exotic and illegal animal parts at a stall on February 17, 2016 in Mong La, Myanmar. Mong La, the capital of Myanmar's Special Region No. 4, is a mostly lawless area where Chinese tourists are able to cross the border for exotic poached animals, gambling, and prostitution.Taylor Weidman/Getty Images Source: WWF To play, just head on over to Google and give it a go.

Leaving aside cases directed toward features related specifically to pharmaceuticals or to the Patent Medicines Notice of Compliance Regulations (PMNOC) the beginning of 2017 provides an opportunity to reflect again on the following cases and events from 2016: 1. File Wrapper Estoppel � Pollard Banknote v. BABN Technologies Corp File wrapper estoppel is a long and well developed doctrine in U.S. patent law. By contrast, in Canada prosecution file history materials are generally not admissible in subsequent proceedings. In a trilogy of cases1 in the 1950's and 1960's Thorson, P., of the Exchequer Court (the predecessor of the Federal Court) rejected the admissibility of the prosecution file histories. Oddly, Thorson P., cited as support the US case Catalin Corp. of America v. Catalazuli Mfg. Co.2, a decision that is one of the cornerstones of US file wrapper estoppel. The decisions were subject to critical comment at the time.3 More recent case law has occasionally edged toward the admissibility. However, in Pollard Banknote Limited v. BABN Technologies Corp., (2016) FC 883 The Federal Court of Canada was not prepared to countenance clearly contradictory positions in prosecution and litigation. In October, Stephen Beney and Nicholas Aitken had pertinent comments, found here. 2. Promise of the Patent and Utility � AstraZeneca v. Apotex Since Turner v. Winter4 where an inventor has made a precise, explicit, disclosure of performance or use, the invention must satisfy that description5. Recently, however, PMNOC proceedings have tended to presume that all patents have "promises", whether or not such a promise exists. Yet in a non-pharmaceutical case it was possible to overlook remarkably narrow explicit promises that actually did exist.6 The rather strained, unicorn-hunting nature of promise-finding has been controversial, and has put Canada off-side of its U.S. and European trading partners. The Supreme Court of Canada has granted leave to Appeal from the FCA decision in AstraZeneca Canada Inc. v. Apotex Inc.7, on this highly contentious issue. In March, Melanie Szweras and Scott MacKendrick weighed in at " Utility - The Heightened Disclosure Pendulum Swings Again", Mike Fenwick at " Supreme Court Promises to Review Contentious Patent Matter" and Adam Bobker and Daniel MacKay at " Leave to Appeal to SCC: AstraZeneca Canada Inc et al v Apotex Inc et al (FCCA)". 3. The Problems of Internet Enforcement Finding a remedy for sales of infringing goods over the internet is often an enormous challenge to patent, trade mark, copyright, and design owners, and one that raises thorny issues of extra-territorial effect. Rather than leave IP owners without a remedy, in Google Inc., v. Equustek Solutions Inc.8, the BC Court of Appeal granted an injunction requiring Google to take down web-sites not merely on Google.ca, but also on Google.ca, but also on Google.com. The Supreme Court of Canada granted Google leave to appeal. Adam Bobker and Janice Calzavara discussed the issue in " Leave to Appeal to SCC: Google Inc v Equustek Solutions Inc (BCCA)". 4. Patents and Competition � New Intellectual Property Enforcement Guidelines The Competition Bureau issue a set of updated guidelines for the enforcement of Competition law in respect of Standard Essential Patents. Paul Horbal and Victor Krichker wrote about the new guidelines in " How will the Canadian Competition Bureau deal with enforcement of Standard Essential Patents?". 5. Other Topics and Cases Rule 216 � Summary Decisions In October, Alain Alphonse discussed the Federal Court of Canada's use of Rule 216 of the Federal Court Rules in Cascade Corporation v. Kinshofer GmbH 9 o resolve a patent dispute by summary procedure in " Patent Infringement Claim Dismissed after Summary Trial - Cascade Corporation v. Kinshofer GmbH et al., 2016 FC 1117." PMNOC s. 8 � Not a Vehicle for Unjust Enrichment Claims In February, Adam Bobker and Anastassia Trifonova discussed the Supreme Court of Canada's dismissal of an attempt by Apotex to use s. 8 of the PMNOC to ground an action for unjust enrichment in Apotex Inc. v. Eli Lilly and Company10 at " Striking Out Unjust Enrichment Claims under s. 8 for Good - the Supreme Court of Canada Denies Leave to Appeal". Patent Act s. 8 Corrections - Gray Manufacturing The reluctance of the Patent Office to exercise the Commissioner's discretion to correct documents in the Patent Office Records has been notable in recent years. Commenting on Gray Mfg Co. Inc., v. Canada (A.G.)11. Ken Bousfield poked fun at the Office in " Sunny Days, Sunny Ways? Gray Manufacturing: Federal Court Becomes Office of Administrative Corrections". Inventions by Government Employees � Brown v. Canada12 In a move that caused some concern in the profession, the Federal Government attempted to employ a rarely used section of the Patent Act to defeat the reasonable interests of a patentee where the inventor was alleged to have been a government employee. The Court viewed the effort with skepticism. Noel Courage commented at " Canadian Feds Issue Patent, Then Try to Invalidate It in Court". Footnotes 1.O'Cedar of Canada Ltd., v. Mallory Hardware Products Ltd., (1956) 24 CPR 103; Riddell v. Patrick Harrison & Co., (1957), 28 C.P.R. 85; and Lovell Mfg. Co. v. Beatty Bros. Ltd., (1962) 41 C.P.R. 18. 2.79 F. 2d 593 (1935), per L. Hand at 594, pointing out that file wrapper estoppel should apply whenever the applicant makes a substantive amendment directed toward allowability, but not where the amendment is formal. 3.See Gordon Henderson Editorial Note in Lovell, supra., at p. 23, for example. 4.Turner v. Winter (1787), 1. Webst P.C. 77 at 82, cited by Parker J., in Alsop's Patent at (1907), 24 RPC 733 at 753. 5. "[If] the Patentee says that by one process he can produce three things and he fails in any one, the consideration of his merit, and for which the patent was granted, fails, and the Crown has been deceived in the grant." 6.See CA 2 207 787 at p. 2, lines 2 � 14; 2012; Eurocopter, s.a. v. Bell Helicopter Textron Canada, 2012 FC 113; upheld 2013 FCA 219. 7.AstraZeneca Canada Inc. v. Apotex Inc., 2015 FCA 158 8.Equustek Solutions v. Google Inc., 2015 BCCA 265 9.Cascade Corporation v. Kinshofer GmbH, 2016 FC 1117 10.Apotex Inc. v. Eli Lilly and Co., 2015 ONCA 305 11.Gray Manufacturing Company, Inc., v. Canada, 2016 FC 55 12.Brown v.

With an estimated 1 trillion–plus images now taken annually, storing and presenting photos has become Google’s next big project—and a powerful way to pull users even further into its orbit. "We thought we could apply machine intelligence in an impactful way around photos and videos to make it easier [for users] to enjoy what they create," says VP of Google Photos Anil Sabharwal. Launched in May 2015, Google Photos coalesces a user’s images across hard drives and devices, as well as closet shoeboxes, thanks to the PhotoScan app, which debuted last November and digitizes old prints. Drawing from Google’s image-recognition and AI capabilities, the service’s Assistant feature can also curate images into movie montages, animations, and collages. (One movie format, called Lullaby, stitches together images of your sleeping baby.) More than 200 million users have embraced Google Photos—an indication of how the company’s restless invention continues to transform culture. "People still scroll [through images] today," Sabharwal says. "We plan to do more to make even that first page of recent photos smarter."

To mark the occasion, Google has come up with another one of its fun Doodle games. This year's one sees you play as a Pangolin, a mammal native to Africa and Asia, on his quest to reach his girlfriend on the other side of the world. The game starts with a cut-scene showing our hero receiving a card from his girlfriend asking him to come and see her, but he realises he doesn't have a present. He notices other Pangolin that are in love eating cake, playing music, dancing and receiving flowers, so he tries to do the same. Google There are four levels to the game, each one set in a different country, and each one has a different task. You start in Ghana where you need to collect cocoa beans to make a cake. It's a platform style game, and you simply use the left and right arrow keys of your keyboard to move the hero around the world. It's very similar to games such as Sonic. You also need to press the spacebar to jump or hold it down to jump higher. You'll need to avoid obstacles that look like circular saws. If you hit one, you don't lose any items you've collected, but you are stunned for a short period of time and you only have 3 minutes to complete each level (4 four minutes on the final level). Each level does show an obvious path to follow, but there are often items hidden behind walls that disappear when you approach them, so make sure you investigate everywhere before moving further to the right. Once you've reached the end of a level, you won't be able to go back. If you don't manage to collect all the items, you can choose to replay the level. Google The second level is set in India and asks you to collect song notes to learn a song. This level is slightly different because for the most-part you're underwater. You still need to use the left and right arrows and spacebar, but you need to keep pressing it to swim upwards and back onto dry land. Google China is the destination for level three, and it features Chinese lanterns which you can use to swing to different platforms. When you jump towards a lantern, you need to press spacebar again to attach to it and press it again to release. Google The final level is set in the Phillipines, where you have to collect flowers to make a bouquet. In the first three levels you need to collect 150 items, but in the final level that increases to 300. There are many more platforms and avenues to explore so be sure to use the full 4 minutes of allotted time. This levels combines everything from the previous three, swimming, jumping and swinging.  Once you reach the end, you're united with your lover, but you trip and fall under the weight of all your gifts. Fortunately, she doesn't mind, she's just happy you're there. If only real love was just as simple. Sections Google Games Nintendo Switch vs Wii U: What's the difference?

There is no word yet if the feature will also head to other Android phones.  ( Google ) Advertisement Google is already rolling out the Instant Tethering feature to Google Pixel, Pixel XL and a slew of Nexus handsets. You might be interested to know that this update will allow any of these smartphones to automatically share their cellular data with supported devices that are signed in to a user's Google account. The explanation is quite a mouthful but, in practice, the process is simple, zippy and smart. How Instant Tethering Works If you turn a Pixel Chromebook on and it finds that no Wi-Fi network is available, it will ask your Google smartphone, say the Pixel XL, to share its connection. If approved, the devices will pair automatically and the handset will start acting as a Wi-Fi hotspot. That is not all. As was previously mentioned, the process is automatic so this involves devices talking to each other through Bluetooth and acting on specific requests and circumstances on their own without user input. Let's go back to the opened Chromebook example. Once it communicates with the Pixel XL requesting a connection, the latter will evaluate its own condition before making an action. The device will check, for instance, if it has enough battery to share data over a period of time. The connection will be denied if there is less juice left. Automated Wi-Fi Hotspot Android users should already recognize the tremendous convenience of the Instant Tethering feature. Up until the update's release, there is a need to turn the Wi-Fi Hotspot toggle on every time they want to share their mobile phone's data. It also has to be deactivated when it is no longer in use to avoid draining battery fast. Now, users will now play very minimal part in the process. The devices will sort this thing out among themselves so that your involvement will probably be limited to just one tap, to confirm a Wi-Fi hotspot connection notification. You will also no longer require a password. Even disconnection becomes automated. "When you are done, if you don't disconnect, we will notice that you stopped using your tablet and we will disconnect the hotspot for you to save your precious battery throughout the day," a Google technician said in the Google Pixel support forum. Launch And Android Compatibility The Instant Tethering feature first surfaced last January. The speculation then was that Google has already unleashed it to a limited number of Pixel users. We have not heard of owners actually experiencing it first-hand so the rollout seems to be really happening around this time. If you own a Pixel smartphone or any of the cited Nexus devices, you need to upgrade to Android 7.1.1 before you can access this new feature. There is no official word yet on how Instant Tethering is getting deployed. A previous Tech Times report, however, has stated that it is part of the Google Play Services 10.2 update.

I am excited to welcome them in joining our mission of building mobility for a billion Indians," added Ankit Bhati. Pranav Tiwari will be leading Ola's team of engineers to enhance and develop Ola's fulfillment stack and allotment platform. The team will work closely with the supply chain team to help create a better experience for customers and driver partners alike, by building solutions that will effectively optimize use of vehicles on the platform, reduce deviations in routes, and improve matching of customer with drivers, among others. Local nuances such as one-ways, short-cuts and unmapped terrains along with diversity in culture, languages and demographics make for a challenging ground reality in India. Therefore, innovations around mapping and geo-locations are extremely critical to offer a seamless experience. Pranav's experience with Google in maps and data mining will aid Ola in driving localized solutions to combat issues that customers and drivers face on road today. "Ola has redefined the way India travels. Ola is driven by the vision of building sustainable mobility solutions for a billion Indians and I am extremely excited to join this mission.

Pranav has over 35 patents in his name, as a result of the path breaking work he has led in the field of web data mining and data scalability. "Ola has achieved tremendous success over the last 6 years, and truly understands what the Indian consumers need and have been able to built technology to support that. I am extremely excited to be now able to contribute to their growth journey. I am sure we will be able to together evolve Ola's platform into a self evolving technological mammoth," said Sanjay Kharb, on his appointment as Vice President - Engineering Infrastructure, Ola. With over 20 years of varied experience across e-commerce, mobile advertising, travel, IoT and auto industry Sanjay led the technology infrastructure domain in Inmobi.

ANI Business Standard http://bsmedia.business-standard.com/_media/bs/wap/images/bs_logo_amp.png 177 22 Ola hires Pranav Tiwari and Sanjay Kharb as Vice Presidents of Engineering Taxi aggregator Ola on Monday announced two significant appointments for strengthening its core technology leadership. The mobile app for transportation announced hiring Pranav Tiwari, former CTO of Cellworks as well as an ex-Googler as the Vice President of Engineering and will be working towards optimizing growth and profitability by bringing in necessary efficiencies in the supply chain function. Sanjay Kharb who was earlier VP - Production Engineering at InMobi has joined as Vice President of Engineering Infrastructure and will strengthen efficiencies in Ola's technology infrastructure including site operability, compliance and data systems. "Ola has consistently invested in technology, consolidating supply chain and building a robust technological backbone, by bringing onboard, world class talent. Both Pranav's and Sanjay's roles are critical and essential to steer Ola to its next phase of growth," said CTO and co-founder at Ola, Ankit Bhati. "They bring in relevant and significant experience with large technology businesses and they have an integral role to play in Ola's aspirations to create innovative solutions that will efficiently solve for the diverse mobility needs of the country. I am excited to welcome them in joining our mission of building mobility for a billion Indians," added Ankit Bhati. Pranav Tiwari will be leading Ola's team of engineers to enhance and develop Ola's fulfillment stack and allotment platform. The team will work closely with the supply chain team to help create a better experience for customers and driver partners alike, by building solutions that will effectively optimize use of vehicles on the platform, reduce deviations in routes, and improve matching of customer with drivers, among others. Local nuances such as one-ways, short-cuts and unmapped terrains along with diversity in culture, languages and demographics make for a challenging ground reality in India. Therefore, innovations around mapping and geo-locations are extremely critical to offer a seamless experience. Pranav's experience with Google in maps and data mining will aid Ola in driving localized solutions to combat issues that customers and drivers face on road today. "Ola has redefined the way India travels. Ola is driven by the vision of building sustainable mobility solutions for a billion Indians and I am extremely excited to join this mission.

He has also worked at Google India for over 12 years leading the engineering site at Bangalore, which is one of the 3 largest Google engineering offices outside US. Pranav has over 35 patents in his name, as a result of the path breaking work he has led in the field of web data mining and data scalability. "Ola has achieved tremendous success over the last 6 years, and truly understands what the Indian consumers need and have been able to built technology to support that. I am extremely excited to be now able to contribute to their growth journey. I am sure we will be able to together evolve Ola's platform into a self evolving technological mammoth," said Sanjay Kharb, on his appointment as Vice President - Engineering Infrastructure, Ola.

In a report by Android Police , the Google App v6.13 enables Google Assistant when a user holds down the home button. Previously, holding down the home button resulted in the launch of Now on Tap. On being launched, the Google Assistant welcomes you with a message, “New! You just got the Google Assistant” after which the setup for voice training begins. Also Read: Google strikes on apps lacking privacy policy The guys over at Android Police tested the app on a Nexus 6P running 7.1.1 Nougat and Galaxy Note 5 running 6.0.1 Marshmallow. Considering it is still an alpha build, the Google App is prone to crashes and errors. So you might not want to install the app just about now. Also Read: Android Wear 2.0 released: Here's everything you need to know Apart from bringing the Google Assistant to other devices, the alpha update also brings in Recent and Lite mode options to the navigation drawer of the app. The Lite mode will apparently use less data in order to render web pages in a simple format. Apart from this, the update also enables users to set up a payment method that integrated with the Assistant.

The one that Google informed that they are working on and it will be released soon. The company has finally released the beta version of YouTube Go along with a Signup page. We installed the app and it works as promised. Image Credit: Google After installing the app from the Google Play Store listing, you need to register the app using your mobile number just like you would on Google Allo or Google Duo. The verification works through an OTP code and then it collates and suggests you videos based on your ‘Thumbs up’, Subscribers and YouTube history in the ‘Home’ tab. The second tab is ‘Saved’ which gives you a list of the videos that you have saved on your smartphone. The downloads work fairly simply. Tapping on any video shows you the ‘Download’ popup, giving you details about the free space on your smartphone and the quality of video that you want to ‘Save’ or ‘Play’. There is no direct way to play any video using this app unless you tap and then select ‘Play’ to play any video. There are a few interesting tidbits that we came across while using the app. The first one was the presence of an ‘in-app updater’ in their ‘Settings’ menu. The second thing that we noticed was the fact that the mobile number being used to register this app should be attached with your Google account or YouTube ID. You could turn the notifications about ‘Daily videos’ in the settings menu. Another important thing is that when you tap on any video, the app shows you snapshots or screengrabs taken from the video in quick succession to help you preview your video before you download the video. The popup also gives the option to download in Low quality or Standard quality along with the size of the video content. Last but not the least, this app lets you share the videos with your friends or family using the ‘Nearby’ feature without the need of any internet. Its not known if the company is using NFC or Android Beam using NFC protocol.

All you need to know The Valentine's Day Google Doodle is one of the most in-depth ones the site has ever created By BECKY PEMBERTON 15th February 2017, 3:15 pm Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window) Comments GOOGLE created a special game as its Doodle to commemorate the annual day of love. Themed around Valentine’s Day, Google’s homepage on Tuesday was an interactive game where users aid a cute pangolin’s quest for love – so what is it all about? 6 The Valentine’s Day Google Doodle is featured around the endangered pangolin’s quest for love What is Google’s Valentine’s Day doodle game? Google created a games series for Valentine’s Day around endangered animals looking for love, with the doodle on the day being dedicated to the pangolin. The fun four-level game centres on a pangolin rolling to China to meet its mate face-to-face on the big day. For the Doodle, Google worked with the World Wildlife Fund to help spread awareness about the pangolin, and included a link so players can donate to the cause. The game took a six-person team of animators and engineers a year to develop, and is one of the company’s most in-depth Doodles ever, according to cnet. 6 The four-level game sees players roll the animal to find its mate, avoiding obstacles and collecting items along the way 6 The game can be played on Googles homepage on iPhones, Androids and desktops What is a pangolin? A pangolin is a cute animal found across Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, which is sadly the most trafficked mammal in the world. It is often known as a “scaly anteater” thanks to its tough scales that protect it from predators. When it is threatened it is able to quickly curl up into a tight ball. Alamy 6 The pangolin is the world’s most endangered mammal and all eight species are trafficked to be eaten or used in Chinese medicine The solitary mammals burrow for ants and termites using their long, sticky tongues, and are able to swim and use their keen sense of smell to find food. These once widespread animals are now a protected species, with over a million being taken from their natural habitat to be used in traditional Chinese medicine or eaten. There are eight species of pangolin and all face threat from trafficking. In July 2011 two tonnes of pangolins were seized by customs officers at Indonesian capital Jakarta airport. 6 The game took a six-person team a year to create How do you play Google’s Valentine’s Day doodle game? Users can play the game on Google’s homepage on iPhones, Androids and desktop computers where they quest to help a love-struck pangolin reach its mate. Game players help the creature roll to four different countries, including the Philippines and Ghana, jumping over obstacles and collecting love-themed items. Movement is done using the left and right arrow keys for direction, with the space bar enabling the pangolin to jump. There are four levels in total, with three minutes allowed for each level. Items along the way,  items are collected to help make love-themed presents for the pangolin’s beau. These include: Level One – cocoa beans for a cake Level Two – musical notes for a song Level Three – ribbons for lanterns Level Four – flowers for a bouquet You need 150 of each item to make the present, and you can attempt the game again if you do not succeed. 6 The game will run until Valentine’s Day, and you can play it as many times as you wish to help the pangolin reach its mate How long will Google’s Valentine’s Day Doodle game run for? The game will run until Valentine’s Day, and you can play it as many times as you wish to help the pangolin reach its mate. Good luck! Why does Google change its Doodles? Google Doodles has become a popular feature over the years but when did it start and what is the history behind it? In 1998, the search engine founders Larry and Sergey drew a stick figure behind the second ‘o’ of Google as a message to that they were out of office at the Burning Man festival and with that, Google Doodles were born. The company decided that they should decorate the logo to mark cultural moments and it soon became clear that users really enjoyed the change to the Google homepage.

just-auto home News & insights News Ford invests in artificial intelligence firm By Dave Leggett | 13 February 2017 Font size Email Print Pictured are: Peter Rander, Argo AI COO; Mark Fields, Ford president and CEO; Bryan Salesky, Argo AI CEO; and Raj Nair, Ford executive vice president, Product Development, and chief technical officer Ford is investing $1 billion during the next five years in Argo AI, an artificial intelligence company, to develop a virtual driver system for the automaker's autonomous vehicle coming in 2021 – and for potential license to other companies. Founded by former Google and Uber leaders, Ford says Argo AI is bringing together some of the most experienced roboticists and engineers working in autonomy from inside and outside of Ford. The team of experts in robotics and artificial intelligence is led by Argo AI founders Bryan Salesky, company CEO, and Peter Rander, company COO. Both are former leaders on the self-driving car teams of Google and Uber. "The next decade will be defined by the automation of the automobile, and autonomous vehicles will have as significant an impact on society as Ford's moving assembly line did 100 years ago," said Ford President and CEO Mark Fields. "As Ford expands to be an auto and a mobility company, we believe that investing in Argo AI will create significant value for our shareholders by strengthening Ford's leadership in bringing self-driving vehicles to market in the near term and by creating technology that could be licensed to others in the future." The current team developing Ford's virtual driver system – the machine-learning software that acts as the brain of autonomous vehicles – will be combined with the robotics talent and expertise of Argo AI. This innovative partnership will work to deliver the virtual driver system for Ford's SAE level 4 self-driving vehicles. Ford will continue to lead on development of its purpose-built autonomous vehicle hardware platform, as well as on systems integration, manufacturing, exterior and interior design, and regulatory policy management. Argo AI will join forces with Ford's autonomous vehicle software development effort to strengthen the commercialisation of self-driving vehicles. Argo AI's agility and Ford's scale uniquely combine the benefits of a technology startup with the experience and discipline of the automaker's industry-leading autonomous vehicle development program. "We are at an inflection point in using artificial intelligence in a wide range of applications, and the successful deployment of self-driving cars will fundamentally change how people and goods move," said Salesky. "We are energized by Ford's commitment and vision for the future of mobility, and we believe this partnership will enable self-driving cars to be commercialized and deployed at scale to extend affordable mobility to all." The collaboration supports Ford's intent to have a fully autonomous, SAE level 4-capable vehicle for commercial application in mobility services in 2021. "Working together with Argo AI gives Ford a distinct competitive advantage at the intersection of the automotive and technology industries," said Raj Nair, Ford executive vice president, Global Product Development, and chief technical officer. "This open collaboration is unlike any other partnership – allowing us to benefit from combining the speed of a startup with Ford's strengths in scaling technology, systems integration and vehicle design." Also complementing the relationship will be Ford Smart Mobility LLC, which will lead on the commercialisation strategy for Ford's self-driving vehicles. This includes choices for using autonomous vehicles to move goods and people, such as ride sharing, ride hailing or package delivery fleets. Ford will be the majority stakeholder in Argo AI. Argo AI's board will have five members: Nair; John Casesa, Ford group vice president, Global Strategy; Salesky; Rander; and an independent director. The $1 billion investment in Argo AI will be made over five years and Ford says is 'consistent with the autonomous vehicle capital allocation plan shared last September as part of Ford Investor Day'. By the end of this year, Argo AI expects to have more than 200 team members, based in the company's Pittsburgh headquarters and at major sites in Southeastern Michigan and the Bay Area of California. Argo AI's initial focus will be to support Ford's autonomous vehicle development and production. In the future, Argo AI could license its technology to other companies and sectors looking for autonomous capability.

IE Home Nation World Opinion Sports Entertainment Lifestyle Technology Viral Photos Videos E-Paper Apps RSS Gadgets Review Photos Videos Mobile & Tabs Science Indian Express Home Home Technology Social Google Assistant could be coming to non-Pixel phones soon: Report Google Assistant could be coming to non-Pixel phones soon: Report Google Assistant, the company's voice-based digital assistant could be launching on Nexus 5X, Nexus 6P devices. By: Tech Desk | Updated: February 13, 2017 2:47 pm Google Assistant could be coming to Nexus 5X, Nexus 6P and other non-Pixel phones as well. Google Assistant, the company’s voice-based digital assistant that can run a number of tasks on the Pixel smartphone, could be launching on other non-Pixel phones soon, notably the Nexus devices. It was earlier reported that Google was planning to bring the Assistant to Nexus 5X, Nexus 6P smartphones as well. It should be noted when Pixel phones were launched, Google had highlighted Assistant as one of the exclusive features for the smartphones. A new report in Android Police has pointed out there’s a new Google app APK file (alpha v6.13) which mentions in the code about process for payment via Google Assistant. However, for those looking to quickly install the APK file, the post also warns the build is extremely unstable and can cause crashes, and results in some issues on the Pixel phone. The Google App APK also has some other new features also: For instance a page of recent search topics, and the new lite mode. Earlier 9to5Google had reported that Google Assistant will be coming to the Nexus 5X, 6P smartphones as well. Google Home as well as Google Allo app also support the voice-assistant. In case of the Pixel, the assistant can be fired up by just long pressing on the home button. Other reports also said Google Assistant on Pixel, Pixel XL will soon support the ability to control smart home appliances, though this feature hasn’t rolled out to all. Also it is unlikely to make its way to Pixel phones in India, given Nest powered devices aren’t available here. Nor is the Google Home. Watch all our videos from Express Technology Google Assistant is supposed to replace Google Now with a more conversational form. Google Assistant can keep a tab on a user’s reminders, appointments, even do a restaurant search for someone, or take a selfie when commanded on the Pixel smartphone. For those feeling bored, Assistant offers the option of playing trivia or games as well, and it actually works pretty well. Also read: Google Pixel XL review: The new Android flagship in the market The idea that Google wants to extend Assistant beyond Pixel phones is not surprising at all. Samsung is gearing up to introduce its own voice-assistant for its flagship Galaxy S8 smartphones, and it could be called Samsung Hello. At CES 2017, we also saw some new devices like with Amazon’s voice-assistant Alexa, which has so far emerged as a popular option via Amazon Echo device in countries like the US. Interestingly another report in Korean media has hinted the LG G6, which will launch at MWC 2017 in Barcelona, could come with Google Assistant in-built as well.   Google, which is seen as the leader Artificial intelligence and machine learning, needs to make sure that its Assistant is widely available to users. So don’t be surprised if it comes to the older Nexus phones pretty soon. © The Indian Express Online Media Pvt Ltd Tags: Google Election 2017 Live updates: PM Modi to address rallies at Hardoi, Barabanki today Uttar Pradesh elections: For Aparna Yadav, Netaji and Congress come together Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections 2017: Campaign and contrast Best of Express Tamil Nadu crisis LIVE updates: Palanisami gets invite to form govt, Panneerselvam camp to move EC EntertainmentPhillauri song Dum Dum: Anushka Sharma, Diljit Dosanjh song celebrates innocent love, watch video EntertainmentKareena, Saif's son Taimur rings in Randhir's 70th birthday.

Reg readers vote Tom Baker for Doctor 13. Of course More like this Ford Emergent Tech Artificial Intelligence Ford fills up ex-Google, Uber engineers' tank: $1bn pours into Argo AI Sizable bet on an autonomous car by 2021 Peter Rander, Argo AI COO; Mark Fields, Ford president and CEO; Bryan Salesky, Argo AI CEO; and Raj Nair, Ford EVP of product development and CTO 13 Feb 2017 at 08:28, Katyanna Quach Ford is investing $1bn in Argo AI, a startup cofounded by engineers who resigned from Google and Uber’s autonomous car projects. Competition to develop the world’s first completely autonomous car is fierce. Companies like Audi, Tesla, Baidu, Nissan, and Toyota are racing to get their brand-spanking-new technologies on the road by 2020. In a desperate bid to not be left behind, Ford has also ushered in an AI startup and hopes to push its robo-cars out by 2021. It’s an ambitious goal, considering autonomous car development efforts haven’t always gone smoothly. Fatal car crashes have marred the public’s confidence in safety issues. Christopher Hart, chairman of US National Transportation Safety Board, was skeptical of the technology and highlighted the need for the federal government to address regulation issues. Brian Salesky, CEO of Argo AI, was director of hardware for Google’s self-driving car project but left in 2016. Before the project was rebranded as a separate Alphabet company called Waymo – but after Google ramped up the pressure – three of its senior members resigned: Chris Urmson, CTO and technical lead; Jiajun Zhu, principal software engineer; and Dave Ferguson, another software lead in the team. Urmson told Bloomberg he was frustrated with the pace of progress, suggesting not all was good under the hood. Dmitri Dolgov, head of self driving technology at Waymo, told the audience during a presentation at the AAAI conference in San Francisco that more work was required to improve the robustness of its cars. Waymo’s car may have driven a blind man to Taco Bell and helped him pick up his dry cleaning in California, but it isn’t quite ready to face all the unknown dangers on untested roads. Comfort factor People get too comfortable and put too much trust in it when they see the technology work for a short period of time. But under the hood, it’s not good enough to trust completely, Dolgov said recently. Peter Rander, Argo AI’s COO, was engineering lead at Uber’s Advanced Technologies Center. Uber has faced difficulties piloting its cars in San Francisco. It hadn’t secured the right permits to allow testing, and the Bicycle Coalition, a non-profit organization hoping to make the city’s streets safer for cycling, reported that its cars would unknowingly (and illegally) swerve into bike lanes. Ford is banking on Argo AI’s experience, and is looking to combine “the robotics talent and expertise of Argo AI” with its “virtual driver system.” Argo AI will receive the money over five years and expects to have more than 200 employees by the end of this year. The company’s headquarters will be based in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and will have major sites in southeastern Michigan and the San Francisco Bay Area. ® Tips and corrections 13 Comments More from The Register Ford slams brakes on sales spreadsheets after fire menaces data center Automaker says backup power saved the day, but monthly financial reports delayed 11 Comments WTF?

Major tech companies including Google and South Korean portal website operator Naver have recently rolled out translation software relying on a new AI-based computing system called “neural machine translation.” Neural machine translation is a new translation algorithm that is distinctive from the widely used phrase-based machine translation system, also known as statistical machine translation.  While phrase-based methods translate individual words and phrases independently within a sentence and rearrange them -- often leading to awkward mistranslations -- NMT views the entire sentence as one unit to be translated at once. NMT simultaneously considers different ways to translate a given sentence, and arrives at the most appropriate outcome based on context, which it learns to discern by studying a vast database of translated materials. The system mimics the workings of the human brain and the way it processes and learns information. Two forerunners in making use of this artificially intelligent computing algorithm include Google’s revamped Google Translate and Naver’s newly released translation app Papago. Google Translate & Naver’s Papago Naver rolled out Papago, which comes from the word “parrot” in Esperanto, in August 2016. The app can translate between Korean and English as well as Korean and simplified Chinese using NMT. It also supports translations between Korean and Japanese, although these translations are dependent on statistical methods for now. Three months later, Google switched its 10-year-old translation system to NMT for eight languages that combined are used by a third of the world’s population -- English, French, German, Spanish, Portuguese, Chinese, Japanese, Korean and Turkish. Both apps can translate typed text, speech and images of words or sentences into the target language. Both claim to offer heightened translation accuracy compared to phrase-based services, and to be able to improve their translations over time through repeated machine learning. The original English sentence reads: "Don’t sweat the small stuff," an idiom used to tell someone not to worry about things that are not important. Naver’s Papago (left) gave the correct corresponding translation in Korean -- "Don’t bet your life on trivial things." On the other hand, Google Translate (right) gave a literal translation: "Don’t sweat out small things (in a physical way)." By adopting NMT, which studies translated materials available on the open web, Google claims it has reduced translation errors by up to 85 percent and tripled its translation computing speed. On the other hand, Naver says that according to its internal tests, NMT — despite having existed for only one to two years — offers translations twice as accurate as its statistical predecessor, which had been regularly updated for more than 10 years. When tested by The Korea Herald, the two NMT-powered translators offered generally improved translations between Korean and English compared to their phrase-based predecessors. Yet, both Google Translate and Papago were prone to mistakes when translating longer, more contextually complex or highly idiomatic sentences, signaling room for improvement. As time passes, these new NMT-powered translation programs will in theory grow smarter, as they study a growing database of translated materials through deep learning — or recurring layers of machine learning. It’s similar to how Google DeepMind’s AI program AlphaGo learned and mastered the complex game of Go by analyzing and studying an enormous database of professional Go matches. Google said its eventual goal is to provide highly accurate translations of English into all of the world’s languages, in turn facilitating improved communication between countries. Naver eyes lead in Korean translations Though the US tech giant has been a forerunner in AI tech development and has an enormous abundance of global services, Naver is confident in its ability to surpass the US tech giant in offering quality translations involving Korean, its home language. “Though reviews may differ, Papago has been shown to be stronger at translating colloquial Korean sentences to English and other languages (compared to Google Translate),” said a Naver official. For example, Papago is able to correctly identify the differing interpretations of the Korean word “bam” — which can mean “night” as well as “chestnut” in Korean, depending on the context of the sentence. In translating the Korean sentence “Should we roast chestnuts (bam) tonight (bam)?” Papago offered the correct translation “Shall we eat chestnuts tonight?” whereas Google missed the double meaning of “bam” and arrived at, “Do you want to have dinner tonight?” According to Naver, Papago is consistently learning from the portal website’s rich database of Korean and foreign languages -- including its web dictionaries, professionally translated text on its video-sharing platform V app, webtoons that are translated into multiple languages and information posted on shopping websites supported by Naver. Looking ahead, Naver plans to expand the languages that Papago supports to include not only Korean, English, simplified Chinese and Japanese, but also Spanish, French, Indonesia, Thai and traditional Chinese. The Korean internet giant plans to incrementally adopt NMT for these new languages, as it builds up a larger database of translations for these major Asian languages, it said. Future of translation As AI-powered machine translators continue to improve, we are all left with the big question -- “Are we nearing an age where learning languages will become obsolete?” According to Mike Schuster, a senior research scientist at Google’s AI development unit Google Brain, automated translators cannot undermine or replace the value of learning languages. “Google Translate is a little step toward getting better translations. But there’s a lot more to do,” said Schuster, who recently spoke to reporters in Seoul via a web conference. “It’s not only the language but the culture we need to understand to make communication perfect,” he said, underscoring the beneficial effects that language learning can bring to a person.

In a system where appeals can be filed again and again, nothing is really over until funds run out. Just take the case between Oracle and Google that has been on-going for almost a decade. After losing it’s case in a federal jury ruling, Oracle has taken the matter to the Appeals Court for the Federal Circuit, insisting that Google’s use of Java in Android is, in fact, illegal. The legal tug of war between Oracle and Google started way back in 2010, at a time when Android’s popularity, and its profitability, was staring to rise. Oracle sued Google for copyright infringement, claiming that Android use of the Java API didn’t fall under fair use. The underlying message is that Google owes Oracle for all the profits and success that Android now enjoys. The lawsuit has been bounced around courts, including appeals courts and even the Supreme Court, the latter when the question of copyright over API was raised. Last year, it seemed that the case has already reached its end when a federal jury ruled that Google’s use of Java API actually fell under fair use. Oracle, naturally, begs to disagree and is bringing its arguments to the Appeals Court. It emphasizes that Google’s use of Java is actually an example of classic unfair use. If the early verdict is overturned, Google could end up owing Oracle the $9 million the latter is seeking. The case has hit many quarters, including open source communities and even Java’s own developer base. Oracle bemoans how Google’s unfair use of Java has critically hurt the Java platform, but many are only too willing to point out that Oracle’s handling of the platform, after it acquired original owners Sun Microsystems, was equally to blame for Java’s current condition.

By Ian Allison February 13, 2017 08:24 GMT Quite often people talk about the fabulous opportunities that open APIs at banks will create for small, innovative fintech startups. What has been less discussed, particularly in the early days of PSD2 (Payments Services Directive), was how large internet companies like Google, Apple, Facebook and Amazon (GAFA) were likely to respond. Icon, a payments consultancy and technology provider, knows a bit about GAFA plans in this area. Tom Hay, head of payments at Icon, said: "We have always said, wait a minute, look at organisations like Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon. Do you think those guys are just going to sit back? "They are going to be right in there. They are going to use it as a platform to make their payments bypass the card companies that they rely on at the moment." Come the 13 January 2018, banks will be forced to open up their APIs to any authorised payment initiation service. It is an absolute fact that as soon as this happens the GAFA guys are going to be targeting the big European banks and pushing payments through them rather than going via the card schemes, because PSD2 initiation is going to be much more cost-effective for the merchants and for themselves, says Hay. Icon has provided consultancy to many banks and other players in this field about how they will meet the technology demands of PSD2. IBTimes UK asked him for any detail about what we can expect from GAFA. "I have probably shared as much as I can," he said. "Let me put it this way – there are definite plans in place, not just to do small scale organic migration – so letting people choose, am I going to pay with my card or am I going to pay directly from my account? GAFA attack "For these guys (GAFA), it's going to be cost effective to have people paying directly from their accounts; they've got plans in place, if not to force, then certainly make it very easy and desirable for people to move in that direction." Banks have been notoriously slow to support any kind of innovation in the world of payments. A lot of banks have started incubators to support fintechs; they are very happy putting up new front ends and so on. But when it comes to making changes to their back office systems, which actually handle the payments, they are only going to do that with a gun to their heads. PSD2 is that gun. And this also presents a market opportunity for GAFA to move in big time. Banks may be skittish about allowing any tinkering under their bonnets and the sharing of their data, but the card networks look like the real losers from PSD2. "Yes it certainly looks that way," says Richard Dear, Icon's business development director. "I think that's one of the reasons why Mastercard acquired Vocalink because it gives them a kind of foot in the door for the non-card payments world. Vocalink is well known in the UK, but it also has an instant payments product which it's installed in Singapore, and they are also installing it in the US. "So having fingers in that pie at least mitigates the risk of the cannibalisation of the card business. I think Mastercard are now not styling themselves as more of a payments business rather than a cards business, so hedging their bets," he said. However, it's not entirely clear how banks will monetise their open APIs. "A lot of banks are struggling to see how this will happen," notes Hay. "You hear some fintech companies claiming you can wave a magic wand and it will become profitable. If you look at the regulation, that's not the case. Those services have to be opened up and you can't insist on contract between the bank and the payment initiation service that's using it. "So I think the mandatory APIs that PSD2 says the banks have got to stand up, they are kind of doing that with gritted teeth. Compliance has forced them into this world of open banking, but the technology base that they are building out will enable them to compete in the API economy and that's where I think the golden future lies for banks." Grown up fintech It should be said, Hay and Dear, who were demoing their Instant Payment Framework (IPF) at Finnovate 2017, are not your typical fintech startup. Their suits are grey and so is their hair; their backgrounds include helping to build Faster Payments in the UK and overseeing large scale infrastructure projects for the likes of Vocalink and tier one banks. This is grown up fintech. Icon has built a global product IPF which is designed to thread its way through the variety of legacy systems that have evolved and been merged between banks over time. Immediate payments, as the name suggests, means the payer gets an immediate confirmation from the payee's bank that the payment has been received and credited to the account. Instead of sending batches of multiple payments, IPF sends messages that carry a single payment. This is the same approach as the card networks, albeit in the opposite direction – card messages are "pull" payments, initiated by the payee's agent and responded to by the payer's agent, while immediate payments are generally "push" payments, initiated by the payer's agent and responded to by the payee's agent. The primary focus of the product is to address what is called SCT Inst, which is the credit transfer instant scheme which is rolling out across Europe and goes live in November this year, and then next up and associated with that is PSD2. "We think the two are very closely linked together because an API which is the key part of the PSD2 is a request with an immediate response – and that's exactly what an instant payment is. So putting an API front end in front of a SEPA payment, which is a next day payment, is nonsense; it's like buying a car and then having it pull your donkey cart along." There may be a tendency to view these regulations through a pan-European optic, when really open API banking is a move underway in the US as well. Commercial reality is going to push banks and payment service providers towards instant payments. "People like PayPal are really interested in payments because it allows them to make payments instantly to the merchants that use their marketplace and they see that as a big competitive benefit," said Hay. "Another recent example is Uber; they want to be able to pay their drivers on a day by day basis, so having to wait for batch payments to clear is not good for them. "We have even seen a tier one UK bank lose one of their big customers because the customer needed to make these instant payments and the customer moved elsewhere. "And when you've got a fantastic front end, if everything else is happening instantly, why on earth would you want to wait a day or two days or three days for your payment to go through?"

According to the blog How to Geek, Edge has a slight edge. Many say Firefox has the last word on privacy, and we find that's it it's pretty private. In 2015, Firefox instituted tracking protection. It removes all tracking elements from pages you visited using the private browsing feature. To use private browsing in Firefox, press control-shift-P for "private." On the Mac, press command-shift-P. It was news to us that advertisers and websites can track you in Google or Microsoft's browsers even if you use the incognito or InPrivate modes. All those modes do is prevent your browsing history, cookies and cached data from being stored on your computer. You're still tracked, unless you use Firefox. We don't care if we're tracked, because it means we'll see ads targeted to our interests. Of greater concern are viruses and hackers. Microsoft and Google use what's called a sandbox so that each component of your browser is kept separate, making it hard for a hacker to join them together. Firefox has more than 18,000 extensions, which are apps that live in the browser. As you might expect, sandboxing all of them has been a problem. They're still working on it. Google has more than 50,000 and managed to do it. The only reason Microsoft Edge might be considered slightly safer than Google Chrome is that it keeps a better list of bad websites, making sure you steer clear of those. However, this shouldn't matter if you use anti-virus and anti-malware software. More browsing And now for something completely different. ... There's much more out there than you can ever find time for: • Opera Mini. For smartphones and tablets, the Opera Mini browser claims to save up to 90 percent of data costs; we saved 50 percent. It also blocks ads and makes multi-tasking a breeze. In our tests, it was just as fast and lovely as any browser, even when watching a movie. • ScienceDirect for phone, tablet or computer. This search engine lets you browse through the titles of 14,324,115 journal and book articles on just about any scientific research topic you can think of. Shouldn't take you more than a few decades. See anything you like? Open access books and articles are free; others are $35. • Torch is a favorite browser of video pirates. (Computer only.) It has a built-in feature for downloading music and video from YouTube and Vimeo. It uses BitTorrent for rapid downloading of videos. It has lots of games. App Store Warning If you use a Macbook, you've probably noticed apps for sale in the App Store; scammers lurk there. The most benign offer to sell you something you can already get for free, such as the online version of Microsoft Word. The worst install malware on your system. Look out for apps offering Microsoft templates. Get those for free at Templates.Office.com. For other apps in the App Store, look at reviews. Often, the first few are phony. Scroll past those to see what victims are saying. Note: This sort of thing goes back many years -- in fact for all of the 36 years we've been writing this column. An easy way to get a product to sell is to find one that already exists for free and offer it for a price. We have seen this done with bundles of free programs as well as single ones. Take a look at Ninite.com for totally free programs. Up to Speed If your Windows 10 computer is running slowly, open the task manager for Windows or for your Web browser. There are at least three ways to get to the Windows task manager. Bob uses control-alt-delete. (Control-shift-escape also works.) Or, right-click the taskbar at the bottom of your screen and choose "task manager." Each item on the list that comes up under "more details" is one of the processes or programs running in the background that is almost certainly slowing you down. Joy's computer is often running at 99 percent of its brain chip's capacity, so clicking the task manager is an everyday thing for her. When Bob checked the brain on his PC, it was running at just 3 percent of capacity. (He says that fits well with his own brain activity.) Recently, a speech engine was hogging the lion's share of Joy's computer's resources. Since she hadn't been talking to Cortana (Window's voice assistant) lately, she clicked it and chose "end task." We also shut down Microsoft Search Protocol Host. But it could be that having too many tabs open in your Web browser is the culprit. Rather than shutting them all down, find out which one is the resource hog. In Google Chrome, look for the three vertical dots in the upper right corner of the screen. Click "more tools," and then "task manager." When we did this, we noticed one website, Techlicious.com, was the real pig. So we closed that tab. Or rather, Joy did. Bob tends to be a one-tab-at-a-time kind of guy. (You can do something similar in Firefox with an add-on.) Chrome also has a "reset" button. Type chrome://settings in the search bar, and when you get to settings, type "reset settings." You can bring Chrome back to its original state. It keeps your bookmarks but gets rid of the junk that bogs you down. Internuts • "Step into a Miniature World of Animated Paper."

Staid Wolfsburg, Volkswagen's home, was not the best place for the automaker to mount a defense against Silicon Valley challengers keen to upend the car industry, and he needed to move. "Nobody knows how the world is going to look" in the coming years, said Harms, a bearded 41-year-old dressed in a gray cardigan over a crisply pressed white shirt. "The biggest skill you have to have is the ability to change." So he packed up and took his team to Berlin, where increasingly urgent attempts to tap into a growing tech scene are part of German carmakers' efforts to ride a digital wave sweeping the industry -- before it rolls straight over them. Autonomous driving, electric cars and ride-hailing apps from Silicon Valley, like Uber, are reshaping transportation. Young people no longer feel as compelled as previous generations to own cars. And Wall Street shows scant respect for automakers and their global manufacturing prowess: The market value of Google, which is building a driverless car, is more than double that of BMW, Daimler and Volkswagen combined. At stake is the fate of the German economy, Europe's largest, at a time when the region is only beginning to emerge from a decadelong economic malaise. Germany, in particular, is as dependent on its carmakers as Michigan is on Chrysler, Ford and General Motors. Non-German carmakers have readily embraced Silicon Valley through partnerships and investment deals. Fiat Chrysler, for instance, is working with Google on self-driving cars. General Motors has poured $500 million into Lyft, the ride-booking service. And Volvo, the Swedish automaker owned by Geely of China, provided the chassis for Uber's recent driverless car tests. By contrast, Germany's automotive giants have favored a more confrontational approach. That has been backed by many locals, who have so far rebuffed Uber's aggressive local expansion plans that have often run roughshod over domestic regulation, and by German politicians eager to please some of the country's biggest employers. BMW, for example, is working with the chipmaker Intel and Mobileye, an Israeli tech company, to develop a self-driving car of its own by early in the next decade. It has also formed a partnership with IBM to use artificial intelligence to allow vehicles to automatically adapt to their owners' preferences. To combat the likes of Tesla, the California electric automaker, BMW is planning to expand its i Series line of battery-powered and hybrid vehicles. Since 2014, it has sold 100,000 of the i3 model, which runs on batteries and has a lightweight carbon-fiber body. Daimler, the maker of Mercedes-Benz cars and trucks, has similarly been investing in digital alternatives. Of the three automakers, it has also been the only one so far to become an active partner with Uber, albeit in a limited deal where it provides a set of its autonomous vehicles to the ride service. The German carmakers' digital plans have led to increased collaboration between what have long been staunch rivals. In 2015, BMW, Daimler and Volkswagen's Audi unit joined forces to buy Here, a digital mapping unit of Nokia, for about $3 billion. While not a household name, the Berlin-based company provides about 80 percent of the built-in navigation systems for cars in North America and Europe, and is the only large-scale competitor to Google Maps. "The future of Germany as an industrial nation depends on how companies succeed in bringing the manufacturing and digital worlds together," said Frank Ridder, research leader for Germany, Austria and Switzerland for Gartner, a technology research firm. Taken together, the carmakers' digital reboot is aimed at rejuvenating Germany's vaunted industrial base. About one-fifth of jobs in Germany are in manufacturing, double the portion in the United States. But factory jobs as a percentage of total employment have been declining for years, prompting the government to dole out hundreds of millions of euros in research and development funds to meld traditional manufacturing with the latest technology. The initiative, called Industry 4.0, reflects a dawning realization that Germany's historic success may not necessarily help the country thrive in a smartphone-centric world. The experience of Volkswagen is a case in point. The company, which is still dealing with its emissions cheating scandal, is the world's biggest automaker, but was the slowest of the three to embrace the digital age, and is now trying to catch up. That is where Harms comes in. A former consultant at Capgemini, he joined the carmaker in 2008 and is now chief executive of MOIA, a new Volkswagen service that sits somewhere between ride-hailing services and traditional city bus networks. Unlike Uber, which has often run into resistance from officials in Europe, MOIA plans to cooperate with local governments and act as an extension of existing public transportation networks. Instead of lumbering buses following fixed routes, Harms said, MOIA shuttles will adjust their destinations and schedules according to customer demand. The vehicles will be electric, and in the future, some may be self-driving. MOIA has yet to sign any deals, but it is negotiating with cities including Hamburg and Berlin. It hopes to expand quickly into the United States and China. In smaller cities, Harms said, MOIA could offer an inexpensive form of public transportation, even though rivals like Uber and Didi Chuxing, a Chinese ride-hailing service, are already well established in many of these locations. "The whole mobility market -- transportation as a service -- is just at the beginning," Harms said. Volkswagen's recent push into new digital frontiers has taken on added momentum since Matthias Mueller took over as chief executive after the emissions scandal. Under Mueller, Volkswagen has set a goal of selling at least 2 million electric cars a year by 2025 as it tries to rebuild its image and reduce its dependence on diesel cars. In June, Volkswagen bought a piece of the ride-hailing business by investing $300 million in Gett, a taxi-hailing service. But for Harms, the carmakers' best hope of survival is if they can prove the value of owning big factories, even though most previous efforts by the industry -- and other traditional sectors -- to compete with digital upstarts have proved unsuccessful. "A vehicle is extremely sensitive. You can't put out a beta version and then two weeks later an update," he said. "We are the ones who already know how to do it very well."

Name: Subject: Message: Deal: snag the Google Chromecast Ultra for just $59 until March 4 Newsby John Callaham3 days ago 1 212 4 Google released a bunch of new hardware products in the fall of 2016, including the Google Pixel and Pixel XL phones, the Daydream View VR headsets, the Google Home connected speaker, and the Google WiFi mesh router. However, it also launched the Chromecast Ultra, a new and enhanced version of its streaming video HDMI dongle that didn’t get as much attention. Now the company has decided to lower the price of the Chromecast Ultra down by $10, from $69 to $59, for a limited time. See also: How to set up a Chromecast with your Android phone December 15, 2016 Here’s a quick refresher: the Chromecast Ultra, like previous versions of the Chromecast dongle, can stream video and other content from your smartphone or from the internet. Unlike the standard model, the Chromecast Ultra can stream 4K resolution (3840 x 2160) videos, if you have compatible apps and, more importantly, a 4K TV or PC monitor. It also includes HDR and Dolby Vision support, and it supposed to be 1.8 times faster in loading content compared to the regular Chromecast. Finally, while it still has WiFi hardware, the Chromecast Ultra throws in an Ethernet port in case your TV is near your router and you want to take advantage of having a wired net connection. The original $69 price tag might have been a tad too much for many people, even with all those hardware improvements, so cutting the price down by $10 to $59 might help convince folks with a 4K TV to grab it. The Chromecast Ultra is being sold at that price at the Google Store, Best Buy, Target and B&H Photo. The Google Store listing shows this $10 discount will last until March 4, so you don’t have a ton of time to snap it up at this reduced price. If you’re interested in taking advantage of the deal, head to any of the four links attached below. Buy now from the Google Store Buy now from Best Buy Buy now from B&H Photo Video Buy now from Target By the way, you can currently get the $129 Google Home speaker from the Google Store and save $15 off its price when you buy it bundled with any Chromecast model.

After much hype created post rumours claiming torrent ban from various search engines including Google, the mystery still begs to be solved. To start with, yesterday’s report claimed that Google along with other search engines is in talks with authorities to curb piracy and copyright infringement, however, a new report from TorrentFreak reveals that there is no concrete mention of torrents ban.   There is no mention of a torrent ban in the new report which heats up the suspense. A Tech2 report further claims that Google indeed is not banning the torrent websites. However, we would still leave it to future reports to clear out the suspense.   Meanwhile, yesterday’s report claimed that the new move is set to be implemented by putting in a new code starting June 1, 2017. While it is true that there is no mention of any torrent ban, but we can’t deny the possibility especially after looking Google’s past records to curb piracy. As an interesting fact, Google claims that it receives about 1 billion copyright infringement claims every year from DMCA. In the past, Google has often blocked torrent websites such as The Pirate Bay and Kickass torrents from its search results, however, removing all the torrent websites from the internet in one go seems a little too ambitious.   In fact, banning here would actually mean a significant decrease in SEO traffic. Google, as we all know, is a widely used search engine and SEO (Search Engine Optimisation) plays an important role. So removing it from search results will actually dip in its SEO traffic. On the other hand, players like The Pirate Bay and Kickass Torrents have already been serving the ban i.e. if you search for a torrent on Google, the search results will not show up links from either of the two above-mentioned websites. Users often just type in the website URL and search for the torrent from the website itself. In other words, these torrent giants still get ample amount of organic traffic despite a significantly reduced SEO traffic. On the other hand, the new entrants or the websites which entirely depend on Google Search results would be affected the most. Torrent websites have been a headache for content creators for quite some time now and Google might have just the right solution for some of them at least for the time being.   Let us know your opinions and what do you think about the whole torrent ban episode, in the comment section below.

While it is rumoured that the LG G6 could be the first smartphone apart from the Pixel range to feature the new assistant, we could see more phones added to the list. A new alpha version of the Google app with version number 6.13 was released for users signed up to the beta channel. The release suggests that Google might release an updated version of the app bundled with the new Assistant. According to Android Police, the app enables the Assistant when you hold down the Home button (just like ‘Now on Tap’). It was tested on a Galaxy Note 5 running Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow as well as a Nexus 6P running on the latest 7.1.1 Nougat update. Of course it is still an unfinished build, but it is good to know that Google is tinkering with its new Assistant and trying to bring it to other devices. Something similar had happened when the Google Now launched was released exclusively to Nexus owners. Eventually the Google Launcher was released on the Play Store as a standalone app  for all the smartphones. We wouldn’t advise you to try out the alpha build though, as it could damage your phone’s software.

In the internet era, search engines like Google do, involuntarily, enable copyright infringement. Bodies like the MPAA (Motion Picture Association of America) and RIAA (Recording Industry Association of America) have made it their mission to destroy copyright infringement. Their fights have resulted in user-hostile DRM, incessant lawsuits and a lot more. Google and other search engines have been asked, and sometimes ordered, to remove infringing content. Governments too have pitched in. In India, for example, piracy websites like The Pirate Bay keep getting taken down. For its part, Google has done a lot to combat piracy. It has a system in place to respond to DMCA (Digital Millennium Copyright Act) requests and has also penalised offenders based on the number of valid DMCA requests received. These moves have apparently resulted in up to a 90 percent decline in search traffic for some torrent sites, or so Google claims. TorrentFreak reports that Google received a billion such requests last year. Anti-piracy lobbyists still don’t think these measures are enough, however, and would rather see these links taken down entirely. Google has always been against such a move as this would amount to censorship. Google also insists that the majority of traffic to these torrent sites is now direct traffic, not search results. A draft Digital Economy Bill is now in the works in the UK which, if passed, will compel search engines to follow a ‘code of practice’ that will determine how they deal with piracy-enabling sites, reports TorrentFreak. The report adds that industry bodies and search engines are not that keen on the bill and that they would prefer to sort things out amicably. To that end, Google and other search engines are looking to implement a voluntary anti-piracy code. Discussions are currently underway, but no decision has been publicly announced. These search giants are reportedly working with entertainment companies to tweak their algorithms and processes to deal with copyright-infringing content.

(Shutterstock/File) Coinciding with the 2017 Safer Internet Day, Google engineering director Parisa Tabriz, who started her career as a freelance hacker and software engineer for Google, shared several internet browsing safety tips via a live interview on Tuesday. In addition to warning about intervention by third parties, even when browsing through a private site, Tabriz said users should always try to protect themselves instead of merely relying on their service provider to do so.  Here are some browsing safety tips shared by Tabriz as reported by Antara news agency.

Google Assistant to help out in non-Pixel devices? By: Rohan Pal, The Mobile Indian, New Delhi Last updated : Monday, February 13, 2017 - 10:52 A new alpha version of the Google app for Android comes with Google Assistant. Google announced its new virtual assistant, Google Assistant, when it launched Pixel and Pixel XL last year. Although it is only limited to Google’s flagship devices, but it seems the search giant might release its virtual assistant to non-Pixel devices as well.   As a report by Android Police, a new alpha version of the Google app for Android comes with Google Assistant. The report further mentioned that both Nexus 6P running Android 7.1.1 Nougat and Samsung Galaxy Note 5 running Android 6.0.1 were able to launch Google Assistant by simply holding the Home button. A dialogue pops up after pressing the Home button which displayed the message "New! You just got the Google Assistant" and users can begin the setup process for voice training. But mind you, being an early version, the app is rather buggy and unstable.     However, the report also noticed that the virtual assistant works better for some than it is for others. This comes as good news for those who wanted to try the latest virtual assistant from Google and it might come to everybody when v6.13 becomes official. We might have to wait a bit to see whether Google Assistant will make it to other non-Pixel devices or not. That 2017 might turn out to be the year of the mobile assistants is a given, with both Apple's Siri and Google Assistant improving in relevance and usability. Users are finally expected to start using them in serious numbers, eventually making the assiatants a real differentiator for buyers and sellers.  Google Google Assistant Google app Google Nexus 6P Samsung Galaxy Note 5 virtual assistant artificial intelligence Android 7.1.1 Nougat Android 6.0 Marshmallow Google Pixel Google Pixel XL First Published : Monday, February 13, 2017 - 10:42 Similar News Now open and use apps without downloading then from PlayStore Now List and Share your favourite places on Google Maps Google torrent ban: Suspense continues Google to soon eliminate millions of ‘zombie apps’ from the Play Store Android Nougat finally crosses 1 per cent mark, Lollipop still triumphs LG Watch Style and Watch Sport with Android Wear 2.0 and Water Resistance announced Hot Trend on TMI Why Snapchat works better on iOS than Android?

The Best Google Assistant Skills To Use With Your Google Home Eric Ravenscraft Feb 13, 2017, 3:45pm ⋅ Filed to:  apps editor's picks google google assistant google home services voice voice commands Share Google Home might not be officially available in Australia yet, but the platform has a bunch of third-party services that work anywhere in the world. If you purchased one of Google's smart speakers from overseas, here are the best services that you should try out. How Google Home Services Work Most of Google Home's third-party apps - which are called "services" - are a little different than apps on other devices. For starters, there's nothing to install or enable. On the Amazon Echo, you have to activate the "skills" you want to use, but with Google Home, they're all turned on by default. If your Home is set up, you can start talking to any of these services immediately with the proper hotword. While you don't need to turn them on, you can find a list in the Google Home app. To find it, tap the menu button in the top left corner, tap "More settings" and then "Services." Here you'll find a list of services you can try. Tap one of them to get a description and some sample commands you can use. [Note: Being a US-only product, you need to change the language settings on your phone to English (US) for the apps to work properly.] A few services are baked right into Google Home, like Philips Hue lights, but most of the third-party services come from external bots. Google treats these like they're separate conversations. For example, say you want to add an item to your Todoist lists. You'll start by saying "OK Google, tell Todoist to add a task to 'buy groceries'." Google Assistant will say "Sure, here's Todoist" and pass you off to the Todoist chat bot. It has a different voice and an entirely different set of voice commands. If you want to ask Google to do something unrelated to your to-do list, you'll have to end your conversation with Todoist first. At first, this can feel a little confusing, but think of it like having a telephone operator connecting you with the person you need to talk to. Rather than Google Assistant ordering you pizza or writing down your to-dos directly, it finds the right person to help you order a pizza or manage your to-dos. Instead of one assistant, you have dozens. Control Your House With Baked-In Smart Home Services A list of commands you can use to play YouTube videos on your Chromecast with Google Home. If you have smart home gadgets in your house, Google Home goes from being a handy gadget in your living room to feeling like magic. Google has made it a priority to work with a number of smart gadgets out of the box, so you can turn your lights on or change the temperature without talking to a third-party bot. Here are the devices that Google Home can control directly: Chromecast: The Chromecast is a surprise hit so it's no surprise Google Home supports it. You can use commands like "OK Google, play YouTube on my Chromecast" and it will start playing videos on your TV. You can play, pause, or find more videos with voice commands from apps like YouTube, Netflix, or Play Movies. Philips Hue: Google Home can turn your lights on and off individually, or group several lights together into "scenes." You can adjust the brightness, or change the colour (if your light bulbs support it). SmartThings: Samsung's SmartThings product line has some of the most robust integration with Google Home. You can add devices to "rooms" that you can control with a single command. You can turn lights, switches, and outlets on or off, and adjust the thermostat. Unfortunately, Google Home doesn't yet support Samsung's garage door openers, sirens, or cameras. Belkin WeMo: Like with Samsung, you can use Google Home to control WeMo light switches and outlets. You can turn them on and off or, if the switch supports it, dim the lights with a voice command. You can even ask "did I leave the bedroom lights on?" to find out if you forgot to turn off a particular light. To use any of these devices, open up the Google Home app, tap the menu button in the top-left corner, and tap "Home control." Here you can add your devices and log into your accounts if necessary. Once each device is added, you can start controlling it from Google Home. Some of these services, like Philips Hue and SmartThings, can even be controlled through Google Assistant on your phone. So, if you have a Pixel - or have enabled Assistant yourself - then you can use some but not all of the same commands even if you're away from your speaker. AutoVoice Brings the Power of Tasker to Your Living Room Tasker on Android is one of the most powerful customisation tools around. Combined with a plugin called AutoVoice, you can use it to create a custom voice command for just about anything. That plugin is now available as a service on Google Home. You can use it to create your own commands to control your phone, or do anything else you can accomplish with Tasker. To use it, you'll need to connect AutoVoice to your Google account in the Google Home app. The video above shows a few samples of what's possible with this powerful combo. You can have Google Home read your phone's notifications to you and reply to your messages, play videos in Kodi, track packages, or find out where your significant other is (if you use location sharing apps). Just to show off, the developer peppered the commands with sound clips from the Simpsons to respond to various commands, demonstrating just how much control you can have over voice commands with AutoVoice. Keep Track of Your To-Do List With Todoist Todoist is one of the few to-do list apps that you can control directly with Google Home. With most other to-do list apps, you need to use services like IFTTT as a workaround, but Todoist has made sure it's available on both. You can use it to add tasks, find out what's on your to-do list, or mark items as done. You can also talk with Todoist as a chatbot in Allo if you'd like, though it's probably easier to just use the Todoist app if you're going to get your phone out anyway. While Todoist is enabled in Google Home by default, you'll need to connect your account in the Google Home app before it can access your lists. Open the Google Home app, tap the menu icon in the top-left, tap "More settings," then "Services." Find Todoist in the list and link your account from there. Hail an Uber If you need to call a car to your home, you can ask Google Home to connect you with Uber. You can use it to request a ride, ask where your ride is, or cancel if you decide you don't need it after all. Once again, you'll need to connect your Uber account in the Google Home app. Use Wonder to Remember Important Information Wonder is like an infinite, virtual post-it note that lives in your Google Home speaker. Ask it to remember something and you can call it up later. For example, you can tell Wonder, "remember that my Wi-Fi password is averygoodwifipassword." Then, the next time you need to recall your password say, "OK, Google, ask wonder what my password is." Google will then have Wonder repeat your password back to you. While this probably isn't the best way to store important information like your social security number, you can use it for minor things like your friends' birthdays or the gate code for your apartment. Wonder also works with Facebook Messenger and Amazon's Alexa, so you can get access to your information even when you're away from your Google Home. Conveniently, Wonder doesn't need to log into any account in order to save your information, so you can start asking it to remember things once your Home is set up. Create Commands to Use On Your Phone or Google Home With IFTTT Google Assistant has an IFTTT channel you can use to create some pretty powerful commands. You can use basic command phrases like "good night" to turn off all your lights, or use text and numerical variables to create more complex commands. For example, you can say "Tell Slack I'm running late" and the command understands that "I'm running late" is the text that it should send to a Slack channel you designate. This channel lets you fill in a lot of functionality gaps that Home might have out of the box. For example, Google Home doesn't let you add events to your Google Calendar (for some reason) but you can set up an IFTTT command that does. It might be a bit of a pain in the neck for something that you'd think it should do already, but at least you have the option. Best of all, applets you create with IFTTT work on your phone as well as Google Home, if you have Google Assistant enabled, so you're not tied to the speaker in your house.

(Image: AFP Relaxnews) Google has announced that the forthcoming update to its Chrome mobile application will allow any web user to enjoy 3D content, without necessarily using the firm's Daydream View virtual reality headset. Read more: Uber Sued of $48 Million Over a Love Affair This new version of Chrome will let mobile device users enjoy 3D content from online platforms such as Matterport, with its 300,000 virtual tours (museums, palaces, celebrity homes, etc.) and the Sketchfab community, featuring around a million animations.

Users who don't yet have this kind of headset can still enjoy the content by navigating around the scene using their finger on smartphone's touchscreen. The Google Daydream View, available in selected countries, is a relatively rudimentary VR headset. Like the Cardboard viewer, it's designed for use with a smartphone, which slides into the headset. However, it offers a more robust build than the Cardboard and comes with a remote control with a trackpad, a gyroscope and an accelerometer. Although considerably less sophisticated than the likes of the Oculus Rift or HTC Vive, this type of headset seems to have a bright future in the tech market. The Daydream View sells for $79 in the USA. Unfortunately, very few smartphones are currently compatible with the Daydream View ( Google Pixel phones, the Moto Z range, the ZTE Axon 7 , for example), which could explain why Google is making a conscious effort to broaden the reach of virtual reality content, making it accessible on all devices. Without that, VR technology could struggle to gain ground among the public at large. 3D Functionality google chrome Virtual reality Recommended For You Eugenie Bouchard Keeps Promise, Pays Off Blind Date Bet News18 Movie Awards 2017: Nominees For Best Supporting Actress Virat Kohli and Steve Smith Inspire Skipper Joe Root Tata Motors and Microsoft Partner to Build Connected Cars for India Kareena Kapoor Khan Says No Crash Diets To Lose Weight Post Pregnancy About Us Privacy Policy Disclaimer Contact Us Sitemap Complaint Redressal Advertise With Us sections India Lifestyle States Tech Politics Auto Sports iVideos Football Power Circuit Latest News Narendra Modi and Akhilesh Two Sides of Same Coin: Asaduddin Owaisi Tata Motors and Microsoft Partner to Build Connected Cars for India Shah Rukh Khan Hopes to Inspire Young Minds: Nayi Soch Lee Dixon Senses Arsene Wenger's Time at Arsenal Nearing End Meizu M5s Android Marshmallow Smartphone Launched Watch LIVE From Network18 News18 India CricketNext News18 States Pradesh18 Bangla News Gujarati News Urdu News Marathi News Topper Moneycontrol Firstpost CompareIndia History India MTV India In.com Burrp E-Learning Franchise Opportunity CNN name, logo and all associated elements ® and © 2016 Cable News Network LP, LLLP.

This is also exemplified by a new milestone just reached by Google. According to the search engine, rightsholders have asked the company to remove content from a million different sites. The targets include some unusual suspects, including The White House, NASA, and the New York Times. Removing search results is nothing new for Google. The company has been cleaning up its search index for years, in response to complaints from copyright holders. Every week the search engine processes millions of requests targeting a wide range of websites that allegedly offer infringing content. The process is fairly transparent as Google publishes all notices in a daily report. This allows us to keep track of the often staggering numbers, and today there’s a new milestone to report. Since Google started counting, the company has now received takedown notices for a staggering one million websites. We’re not talking about the number of URLs that were reported in total, as these run in the billions, but the separate domain names that were called out. A million… Looking more closely at the statistics, we see that a large proportion of the targeted sites have only been flagged a few dozen times or less. Many of these were called out by mistake, including some high profile ones. The White House, for example, is not your typical pirate site and neither is the U.S. Department of Justice. Still, both sites have been repeatedly reported to Google. The same is true for other big names such as NASA, Netflix, the BBC, and the New York Times. The White House The movie database IMDb is one of the sites that’s most frequently reported in error. In recent years Google was asked to remove more than 1,000 URLs, which the search engine wisely refused to do. While it’s easy to highlight individual mistakes among a million entries, the majority of the requests are indeed targeted at pirates.

Google Finally Lets You Download ADB and Fastboot As Standalone Tools Windows/Mac/Linux: Google's ADB and fastboot are incredibly powerful command line tools for customising your Android phone.

She's been nominated more than any woman ever: 62 times. February 13, 2017 roxane gay (@rgay) Lemonade was an ALBUM. It was a cohesive, connected body of work. It was a story.

Arriving onstage again for the night’s big award, she’s tearful and unprepared. “As you can see it took an army to make me strong and willing again” she says as the crew who worked on the album enter the stage with her. She talks about how difficult motherhood is and again talks about the importance of Beyonce. She says that Lemonade is a monumental, soul-bearing album and again drops a swear which gets bleeped out. “The way you make my black friends feel is empowering” - she says before thanking her family.

She then returned to tell the crowd that she doesn’t love her dad and that she wants Bey to be her mommy. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 11.28pm EST 23:28 John Legend and Cynthia Erivo sing God Only Knows Benjamin Lee Photograph: Mark Ralston/AFP/Getty Images It’s been a typically patchy night for tributes but this is a rather lovely way to remember the long list of greats who have died in the past year. The pair sing beautifully together and they act as a prelude to a montage of faces including Sharon Jones, Phife Dawg, Prince, Leonard Cohen and George Michael. It’s also a rather admirably extensive list, highlighting the lesser known figures as well. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 11.23pm EST 23:23 Benjamin Lee Hilariously, James Corden just pretended Kanye was coming on but, get this, he isn’t! It’s Neil Portnow, the current president of the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences, and he’s talking the importance of unity. “We are and always will be one people” - he’s talking about music being a unifying artform at a time such as this. Beyonce and Jay Z are both chewing gum while they watch, bored. It’s a call to Trump essentially for him not to affect any laws that protect musicians and their rights. There’s even a hashtag! Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 11.15pm EST 23:15 Chance the Rapper sings No Problem Benjamin Lee Photograph: Kevin Winter/Getty Images for NARAS One of the night’s big winners shows why he’s been getting so much love from the Grammys this year with a rousing performance kicked off with an impressive verse filled with so many words that it seemed like his head might explode at the end. Like some of the tracks on his album, there’s a gospel vibe on stage with a choir belting the tune out. There’s almost too much going on at times but it’s all good stuff at least. It’s always worth remembering, with a touch of bitterness perhaps, that Chance the Rapper is just 23 years old. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 11.09pm EST 23:09 Benjamin Lee Pentatonix doing a rather heinous Jackson 5 cover now. But hey, it was mercifully short so someone is listening. James Corden is now chatting to the audience again, showing that everyone is actually sitting on folding chairs. It still feels unlikely that Beyoncé wouldn’t be given a folding throne at least.

They go into Jungle Love with Morris Day on fine form – he’s demanding everyone gets up and the majority of people comply. They then go into The Bird as Rihanna and Beyonce look on approvingly. They’ve not gone for the big hits here but people are losing it - even the yellow haired Twenty One Pilot is getting down. Bruno Mars is back to perform Let’s Go Crazy, which ups the glam from The Time but loses on authenticity points. Mars pulls off a decent guitar solo, and then gets intimate with his guitar’s neck.

They start with Award Tour with Paak on drums and vocals and then segue into Movin Backwards. Then Busta Rhymes comes out and thanks President Agent Orange (aka Donald Trump) for trying to implement the ‘muslim ban’, as the ensemble play We The People. The group then bring out women in head scarfs and a crowd of people who look upset while they chant “resist!”. Definitely the most political moment of the night so far.

She says Hello is her favorite song and then they cut off Greg who wrote the song with her.

Demi Lovato Photograph: Lucy Nicholson/Reuters It’s here: the tribute which makes no sense - as Little Big Town, Demi Lovato, Tori Kelly, Little Big Town and Andra Day – so essentially artists who have nothing to do with the group or their sound, perform a medley. Lovato knocks out Staying Alive before Little Big Town do How Deep Is Your Love. Barry Gibb is singing along, as is Rihanna. Andra Day comes in to give a full-blooded rendition of Night Fever, but she can’t quite reach those high notes.

Backed by the Dap Kings who are most famous for their work alongside Sharon Jones and Amy Winehouse, he knocks out a soul country number that sums up why he’s in the running for that best album gong. It’s both rousing and pained.

The sound is a disaster as James Hetfield’s mic fails to work. He adlibs and shares Gaga’s microphone as they sing Moth Into Flame from the metal icon’s latest album. Despite the technical issues this is impressive. Gaga’s metal chops are great, even as she shares a mic with one of the genre’s most intimidating figures who was clearly annoyed at the malfunctioning equipment. He tossed his guitar in the direction of his guitar tech at the end.

It goes to Chance The Rapper, who is having a stellar night and perhaps benefiting from the no shows if we’re being honest. He thanks god again, this time for his friends and family. “It’s for every independent artist,” he says.

Google Drive Blocks Users From Sharing Pirated Content With Hash Matching Spandas Lui Feb 13, 2017, 10:00am ⋅ Filed to:  Australian Stories cloud cloudhacker google drive piracy Share Image: Google It's not a big surprise that some people use Google Drive, one of the biggest cloud storage service in the world, to store pirated video content. But Google Drive has a way of detecting copyrighted material and blocking users from sharing them. After getting a tip from a reader who received an error message when they tried to share a Google Drive link of a Hollywood movie, TorrenkFreak delved deeper into the issue. While Google was unable to comment on it, TorrentFreak went through a transcript from a Copyright Office Roundtable in the US last year and found more information on how Drive checks for pirated content. According to Google's legal director for copyright Fred Von Lohman, Drive uses matches the hash of copyrighted video content with files that are stored by users to identify pirated content. Google does this on a voluntary basis. It's likely that, much like its rival Dropbox, Google notes down the unique hashes of content from takedown requests they receive. TorrentFreak noted that simply storing pirated content doesn't seem to raise any alarm bells with Google Drive.

Adam Levy (TMFnCaffeine) Feb 12, 2017 at 5:00PM It didn't take long for Google's biggest cloud customer to split its allegiances. Just a week after Snap (NYSE:SNAP) announced it signed a $2 billion five-year contract with the Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) company, it signed a $1 billion contract with Google's biggest cloud competitor -- Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). Snap will continue to use Google Cloud for the core Snapchat functionality. The Amazon Web Services contract is for "redundant infrastructure support of our business operations," according to Snap's amended S-1 filing. The new filing also revealed Snap has been using Amazon for nearly a year, so not much will change in the near term. But the way Snap's contract is structured with Amazon, it could be spending nearly as much on AWS five years from now as it is on Google Cloud. It's worth taking a closer look at Snap's cloud contracts. Image Source: Snap. A quick look at Snap's cloud contracts Year Amazon spending Google spending 2017 $50 million $400 million* 2018 $125 million $400 million* 2019 $200 million $400 million* 2020 $275 million $400 million* 2021 $350 million $400 million Source: Snap S-1. *Snap has the option to defer up to 15% of the amount to the subsequent year. Snap uses Google for most of its heavy lifting today. That might change in five years. While Amazon just provides redundancy for Snapchat to ensure the app doesn't suffer significant downtime right now, it could grow into a much bigger partner for Snap. That's evident by the ramp in minimum obligations. Google still has a big advantage over Amazon. Snap built Snapchat on Google's Cloud Platform. Transition to another cloud provider "would be difficult to implement, and may cause us to incur significant time and expense," it said in its S-1. What's more, Snap built Snapchat using the tools available on Google," some of which do not have an alternative in the market," according to its prospectus. But if Snap wants to expand to China, where Google doesn't operate, it'll have to rework things on another cloud provider, anyway. Considering the growing size of Snap's cloud spending, Amazon may be able to offer tools comparable to what it uses on Google to help facilitate a transition. Google's cloud business is minuscule in comparison to Amazon's. Snap's $400 million per year contract very likely made it Google's biggest cloud customer, and now Amazon's going to steal away a good chunk of its business. That doesn't mean much for Amazon -- its cloud business brought in $12 billion last year -- but it means a whole lot to Google. What this means for Snap Snap is now committing $3 billion to cloud services over the next five years. That's a lot for a company with only $405 million in annual revenue, even one growing as quickly as Snap. At some point, it would make more sense for Snap to build out its own infrastructure like other popular internet services. Building infrastructure is capital intensive, but once it's built, the company would no longer be as reliant on third parties to support its flagship app. With Snap locked into contracts for the next five years, it's unlikely we'll see it go that way anytime soon, which means continued pressure on its gross margin. Last year, Snap's cost of revenue exceeded sales. The bulk of its cost of revenue was attributed to its cloud infrastructure expenses, which climbed $192 million last year. As such, Snap posted a negative gross margin, which is crazy for a company that primarily produces software. By 2021, Snap will be paying at least $750 million for cloud services. That will make it one of the largest cloud-computing customers in the world. With that much committed to Google and Amazon, Snap better get to work on growing its revenue.

As first reported by Android Police, it looks as though an alpha version of the Google app has appeared in the wild by way of the version 6.13 update, and while it’s rather buggy, it’s the first time we’re able to see Assistant on a phone that isn’t a Pixel or Pixel XL. As Android Police noted, both a Nexus 6P (running Android 7.1.1) and a Samsung Galaxy Note5 (running Android 6.0.1) were able to launch Google Assistant with the user simply holding the Home button. After a few moments, a dialogue with the message “New! You just got the Google Assistant” popped up, and allowed for users to set up voice training. More: Google Assistant adds another 10 skills, including a virtual sommelier Be warned, however, that given that this is still an alpha version of the newest software, it’s working better for some than it is for others. It doesn’t seem to be linked to device type (some Nexus 6Ps got Assistant to work, while others didn’t), though it could be contingent on phone settings or other app versions. Regardless, the very presence of Google Assistant on v6.13 could mean exciting things for folks who have been waiting to get Google Assistant on their existing Android devices. While we’re not rushing to any conclusions, it could be the case that Assistant will be made available to everyone when v6.13 becomes officially available. However, it’s also possible that some devices got Assistant as an error when mistakenly identified as a Pixel handset in settings (that said, the introductory messages that new users received suggest that this was not an error). Regardless, we’ll have to wait a bit longer to see exactly when Google Assistant becomes more widely available, but perhaps not as long as previously thought.

Published on February 12, 2017. Hyundai ad runs as pre-roll to video supporting Hezbollah in screen capture provided by Gipec. Credit: Gipec Most Popular Like many Super Bowl ads, Hyundai's salute to U.S. troops, which appeared just after the game, got considerable exposure later in the week on YouTube, including where the brand never intended – as pre-roll to a video supporting Hezbollah. The Iranian-backed group, designated a terrorist organization by the U.S., is among other things believed responsible for the 1983 truck bombing of a Marine barracks in Beirut that killed 241 U.S. service personnel on a peacekeeping mission. Hyundai was among several major advertisers last week that had their ads appear alongside videos that appeared to support terrorism, the latest cases of a recurring problem that prompted a call from the World Federation of Advertisers for Google and others to be more vigilant, and a sign that efforts by marketers to stay clear of unsavory digital content aren't always working. Hyundai finds the YouTube placement "highly concerning," said Jim Trainor, director-communications for Hyundai Motor America, in an e-mail statement on Friday. "We've been working with Google to find out how it happened this time and to ensure that it doesn't happen again. We have strict guidelines when working with Google. Our 'blacklist' [never-to-appear-on list] overrides all other criteria to ensure that violent or extremist sites never serve our content." Several other Super Bowl ads also appeared post-game either in pre-roll or right-rail placements alongside the Hezbollah video or a separate "Indian Nasheed" whose English subtitles encouraged violence against the Pakistani army for its actions against Islamic militants. Those included ads from AB-InBev's Budweiser and Bud Light, T-Mobile and, at least according to screenshots provided by third-party monitoring firm Gipec, Airbnb and Procter & Gamble Co. The "Indian Nasheed" video was removed from YouTube after an Ad Age inquiry to Google, though the video bearing the Hezbollah logo remains. "We have clear policies prohibiting terrorist recruitment and content intending to incite violence, and quickly remove videos violating these policies when flagged by our users," a Google spokesman said in an e-mail statement. "We also have stringent advertising guidelines, and work hard to prevent ads appearing against any video once we determine that the content is not appropriate for our advertising partners. When we become aware of ads that are being served against ineligible content we immediately take action to remove them." A spokeswoman for T-Mobile said the placements of its ads on the videos in question weren't authorized by the company. A P&G spokeswoman said the company hadn't been able to verify yet whether its ads actually ran opposite the "Indian Nasheed" in a placement depicted in a screen capture by Gipec, a Michigan firm that monitors the internet for criminal activity and objectionable content. In other cases, Ad Age saw pre-roll ads from brands in question on the videos. "We have not yet verified with Google if the ad ran as depicted, and that is an important first step because third-party information is not always accurate," a P&G spokeswoman said in an e-mail. "We are in contact with Google to investigate, and it appears that the video has been removed." Spokespeople for Airbnb and AB InBev, marketer of Budweiser and Bud Light, didn't respond to email requests for comment on Friday. T-Mobile ad runs in pre-roll before video supporting Hezbollah. Credit: YouTube The issue comes amid increased scrutiny about the integrity of the digital ad buying supply chain following P&G Chief Brand Officer Marc Pritchard's "call to action" speech to an Interactive Advertising Bureau gathering last month. On Thursday, in response to a separate story by the Times of London about similar YouTube placements as well as programmatic ad buys on what appear to be sites promoting jihad or Nazism, the World Federation of Advertisers cited such placements as part of larger problems in the digital supply chain. The WFA specifically called out programmatic ad placement, which its research shows now makes up 16% of large multinational global advertisers' budgets, up from 10% two years ago. "Both we and our members are increasingly concerned about the lack of transparency in this ecosystem," said WFA CEO Stephan Loerke in a statement. "This takes many forms; including brand misplacement (as highlighted in recent media reports) but also the endemic levels of ad fraud." While brand owners may be taking steps to protect themselves, Mr. Loerke said, "it is ultimately incumbent on the platforms … to do more to restrict this sort of inappropriate content from appearing in the first place." The Association of National Advertisers is also concerned. Preventing ad placements on objectionable content are part of the mission of the ANA-backed Trustworthy Accountability Group. Google was one of the initial recipients of TAG's "Certified Against Fraud" seal in December. "Certain types of content, such as terrorist activity and IP infringement and pornography, they're all prohibited from having ads served against them" by TAG standards, said ANA CEO Bob Liodice in an interview. Reports of ads placed alongside content supporting terrorist organizations are among examples, he said, of why "marketers have to take their industry back." But he said, "We need to recognize that we're still not winning enough," adding that "we need to keep advocating, pushing and investing behind protocols that will allow us to do that." Gipec CEO Eric Feinberg said in an email that ad placements on YouTube, such as the Super Bowl ads, may help fund terrorist groups such as ISIS, a contention also made in the Times of London piece and a separate story Thursday from Fox News. Ad Age did see pre-roll ads from two other major national advertisers running opposite a "nasheed" music video with an ISIS flag on Thursday, in addition to the other videos, though the exact content wasn't apparent. But in this, and the other cases, it's unclear who posted the videos or where the money shared by Google through its partner program actually goes. Airbnb Super Bowl ad runs with video supporting Hezbollah in screen capture provided by Gipec. Credit: Gipec Efforts to flag of objectionable content aren't always foolproof or easy either. In other cases, nasheed videos Mr. Feinberg cited, which feature vocal music on Muslim religious themes either a capella or with percussion instruments, did not have obvious exhortations to violence or association with designated terrorist organizations.

How To Make The Most Of Valentine’s Day With Android For Couples Google Assistant Could Make It Onto Non-Pixel Phones February 12, 2017 - Written By Justin Diaz Google Assistant could make it onto non-Pixel phones according to some recent findings in the latest APK for the alpha version of the Google app. While alpha releases of Google apps aren’t generally available, at least for the Google app itself, beta versions of the Google app and other apps that Google offers are available for installation. In regards to the Google app, some users who are part of the beta channel have been getting an alpha release build. While this is a little bit out of the ordinary and it isn’t clear if Google had intended to send these builds of the app out to users, the more intriguing detail is that Google Assistant becomes available on devices which aren’t a Google Pixel after installing the alpha release of the Google app. What’s more is that Google Assistant is reportedly working for users who have this Google app build. According to the details it’s been stated that it’s working on both Android 7.1.1 Nougat and Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow. The Nougat-powered device was a Nexus 6P, which may not seem as strange since it is a Google device, but the device running Marshmallow is a Samsung Galaxy Note 5, which suggests that Google may be planning to roll out Google Assistant to other non-Pixel and non-Nexus devices. It’s also possible that Google Assistant won’t require users to have Android 7.0 Nougat installed, though it may be required to have at least Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow for Google Assistant to work. It’s also stated that both of these devices were able to access Google Assistant by holding down the home button, which could very well be the way other devices access it if Google rolls it out widely with a stable release of the Google app in the future. It’s noted that not all devices which have installed the alpha build of the Google app have had Google Assistant appear when holding down the home button, but just the fact that it’s appearing is likely to be exciting for users who have wanted access to the feature but don’t have a Pixel or Pixel XL to utilize it. When Google might plan to make the feature available with the Google app officially is unclear, but at least it seems to be on the way, and possibly soon.

Again. Twitter VP of Engineering Ed Ho this week announced three changes that Twitter believes will end its reputation as a haven for trolls, haters, spammers, misogynists, racists and idiots. Two years ago, Twitter's then-CEO Dick Costolo was quoted in a leaked memo saying that "We suck at dealing with abuse and trolls on the platform and we've sucked at it for years." [ To comment on this story, visit Computerworld's Facebook page. ] Twitter's reputation may be hurting its bottom line. The company this week reported its slowest quarter for revenue growth since the company went public. Twitter consistently loses about $100 million per quarter. Advertising is weak. Revenue is down. User growth is flat. Advertisers don't want to be associated with Twitter because it's a bad neighborhood. Harassment is a perennial problem on the network. Companies apparently don't want their brands sandwiched between nuggets of hate speech. (Twitter executives declined to be interviewed for this story.) Sadly, Twitter's changes won't stop harassment. They'll make the problem worse. And they'll make the quality of everyday conversations on Twitter worse, too. I'll tell you why. But first, let's look at Twitter's three new changes. First, Twitter claims it's "taking steps to identify people who have been permanently suspended and stop them from creating new accounts." Twitter won't say what these methods are. Second, Twitter intends to remove tweets by default from search results if they contain "potentially sensitive content" or if they were posted on accounts that have been blocked or muted. However, users have the option to disable this "smart search" and see unfiltered results. Third, Twitter will automatically "collapse" or hide objectionable replies, which include those deemed "abusive" or "low quality." These will be viewable by clicking on a link that says "Show less relevant replies." All this sounds pretty good, until you take a closer look. Why Twitter's changes won't work Twitter is relying in part on software-controlled moderation. This approach is inferior to user moderation. The most effective user moderation is the ability to delete the replies of other users. If you post something on a social network, you should be able to delete any reply to that post from any user for any reason. You can delete replies on Facebook, Google+, YouTube, Instagram, Pinterest, Tumblr and every other social network I can think of. Not Twitter. If someone replies to your tweet with something hateful, hurtful or threatening, you can't delete the reply. Trolls love this about Twitter. This is why Twitter has a harassment problem. User moderation works because people are good at knowing when replies are made in bad faith. Their ability to delete replies frustrates trolls, who learn that harassment is futile. Sure, trolls can post hateful comments elsewhere. But without the power to disrupt conversations against the wishes of the person who started the conversation, harassment is futile. Instead of giving users the power to delete replies, Twitter relies on two alternatives: a user reporting system and automated software-based moderation (with help from Twitter staff). The trouble is software can't identify bad replies as well as people can. I learned this fact on Google+. Google may have the industry's best algorithms and artificial intelligence. But even Google's software fails for content moderation. Google has been algorithmically flagging "low quality" replies on Google+ for years. It hides flagged replies by default, and users can reveal them with an obscure "See all comments" menu item, which most users don't know about. I would guess that around 10 percent of high quality replies are flagged as "low quality." And probably an equal number of "low quality" replies are judged as "high quality" and allowed to appear among the other replies. Filtering software just doesn't work that well. For example, I recently posted on Google+ what I call a "Mystery Pic." I post a picture of some technology thing and invite followers to guess what's in the picture. One person guessed: "A pod or a wheel from office chair" -- exactly the kind of reply I was looking for. Google's software flagged that comment as spam and buried it so nobody could see it. Just below that, someone posted a hyphen and nothing else, an incredibly "low quality" reply. Google's software identified that hyphen as a high-quality reply and allowed it to remain. Software simply isn't advanced enough to judge language. Google's automated identification and hiding of "low quality" comments fail, and the result is that Google+ simply isn't as good as it could be. Bad comments appear. Good comments are buried. The same outcome is likely on Twitter. The difference is that on Google+, I can make the effort to correct bad decisions by the software. On Twitter, I can't. When Twitter's systems fail to identify a bad reply, the bad reply will remain. When Twitter's systems bury a good reply, I can see the good reply by clicking on a link. But it will remain buried for other users, thereby degrading the quality of conversation on Twitter. Trolls will figure out how to game the system to avoid being buried. Any kind of system designed to keep motivated people out -- whether they're anti-hacker, anti-spam or, in Twitter's case, anti-harasser -- is essentially an arms race. As Twitter tries to develop better anti-harassment systems, the harassers will learn how to get around them. Compounding Twitter's unwillingness to allow industry-standard user moderation, Twitter resists pseudonymity -- where Twitter knows who you are but the public does not. Twitter users are fully anonymous. That means any so-called "user" might be a bot, a troll paid by the Russian government or a person with 100 accounts. There's usually no way to know. (Researchers last month discovered a network of 350,000 fake user accounts controlled by automated bots that had existed undetected for years.) The anonymity of Twitter users makes me doubt that the company can succeed in their attempt to "identify people who have been permanently suspended and stop them from creating new accounts." How can you "identify people" without, you know, identifying people? And how will Twitter avoid blocking new and legitimate accounts by accident? It gets worse: One of Twitter's new anti-harassment systems itself can be used for harassment. Twitter promises to remove tweets from search results posted by accounts that have been blocked or muted. This is the best thing that ever happened to haters. Now abusers can simply block or mute their victim in an organized effort, or by a single user with dozens of accounts, and thereby remove their victim from search results. Victims may be unaware that abusers have blocked them from search results. Many victims of harassment will be automatically silenced in Twitter search the second this change goes into effect (it's being rolled out over the coming weeks). For example, let's say a woman has been speaking out on Twitter about sexism in video games. And let's say she has attracted haters and has been arguing about it on Twitter for the past two years. No doubt she has been blocked by dozens or hundreds of Twitter users. Now, when the new rules go into effect, her tweets in the past, present and future will be removed from search results. If the haters haven't silenced her yet, Twitter will finish the job. Only three methods can effectively curb out-of-control harassment on social sites: user moderation of comments, user ranking of comments and the disallowance of anonymity. Twitter rejects all three methods, and so chronically suffers from a reputation for harassment. Imagine if Twitter accepted all three. It could be the greatest site on the Internet. Instead, Twitter has now implemented software-controlled moderation and other systems that will reduce the quality of Twitter conversations and silence constructive users. They will be gamed by active trolls and generally result in a lower quality social site. Twitter is in trouble. The company isn't growing, profiting or succeeding. Twitter should be the world's town square, a level playing field that unites everyone in conversation and sharing. Never before has there been a social site so relevant, and at the same time so unsuccessful. Twitter is ruined by its reputation as a hotbed of harassment, trolling and vitriol. And it's so unnecessary. Twitter's refusal to implement user moderation, which would solve the problem overnight at close to zero cost to the company, is business malpractice in the extreme and an abdication of the trust that millions of users have placed in the company. Twitter wants to be great. But the company's leaders simply won't allow that to happen. 6 Styles of Customer Analytics More from Gartner Join the CIO Australia group on LinkedIn.

NEW YORK—Ok, Google. Hey, Siri. What's up, Bixby? Bixby doesn’t have the name recognition of Apple’s Siri or the Google Assistant. That might change if rumors suggesting that a digital assistant called Bixby will be the new AI-infused helper inside Samsung’s next big flagship phone prove correct. Popular Searches Ralph Lauren Corp RL ▼ 79.17 -0.32 -0.40% Michael Kors Holdings Ltd KORS ▼ 38.05 -0.05 -0.13% Sanderson Farms Inc SAFM ▲ 93.83 +0.82 +0.88% Tyson Foods Inc TSN ▲ 65.33 +0.33 +0.51% Samsung is expected to unveil the smartphone, presumably the Galaxy S8, in March, though the South Korean tech giant could tease its arrival later this month during the Mobile World Congress tech confab in Barcelona. One thing that’s obvious: Samsung can’t aim the spotlight on a new phone fast enough, not after the pricey and embarrassing battery-gate debacle that was the Galaxy Note 7. Samsung recently cited design and manufacturing flaws from two unnamed suppliers as the reason some lithium-ion batteries inside the phones caught fire. Whether it is called Bixby or something else, it appears a fresh voice-driven AI assistant will be one of the banner features inside Samsung’s new phone, hardly surprising given the race to raise the IQs for such brainy digital assistants. S-Voice or Viv? Among the outstanding questions is whether Bixby will build on Samsung’s existing (and frankly underwhelming) S-Voice feature, leverage the conversational-based voice technology from Viv Labs, a startup the company bought in October, or apply some combination of the two. I’ve certainly been impressed by early demos of Viv, which was founded by Siri co-creator Dag Kittlaus. But demos are demos and the tech must prove itself in real world use. Equally unknown is how a user might summon Bixby. There could be a dedicated button for such a purpose, or perhaps you'll bark out wake words, along the lines of "OK Google" and "Hey Siri."  Samsung remains mum publicly on Bixby or other features that might be coming to its latest flagship, but there’s certainly no shortage of rumors. The likelihood is that you’ll see not one but two new S8 models, with the larger of the pair pushing screen size well past 6-inches. Samsung’s playbook through the past several iterations of the series has been to introduce a standard Galaxy S model and a Galaxy S version model with a secondary curved edge display. Citing unnamed sources, the Wall Street Journal says there will only be curved display models this time around, albeit in the different screen sizes. . The Journal also said that the fingerprint scanner that’s currently on the home button could be moved to the back of the phone. We'll see. Whatever features end up in a final product, the S8 launch is critical to Samsung. Coming off the Note 7, Samsung must change the narrative on its mobile business. What's more, arch-rival Apple is expected to up its own game later in the year, when it launches the ten-year anniversary edition of the iPhone.  For Samsung's sake, its new AI assistant best be able to live with pressure.

Oracle is alleging that Google's Android software violated Oracle's copyright, by copying certain code made by Oracle. Oracle lost in the disctrict court, but reasons that the issue should be heard again, as the district court obstructed Oracle's case by not letting it present necessary evidence. The district court held that the code used by Google was an allowed fair use under US Copyright law. If Oracle was to succeed in the lawsuit, it could reportedly be worth billions of dollars. Google and Oracle had tried to negotiate a settlement but after the negotiation broke down in 2012 the case was heard [JURIST report] by the US District Court for the Northern District of California. Oracle lost the case [JURIST report] and was ordered to pay $1 million in court costs to Google, following a jury verdict [JURIST report] in favor of Google. The case was later remanded [JURIST report] back to the district court for further consideration of Google's fair use defense, and the court again held for Google.

Aside from Bixby, the tech company has also filed a patent for "Samsung Hello."  ( Alex Wong | Getty Images ) Advertisement As we inch closer to the launch of the Samsung Galaxy S8, the more rumors are floating about the phone. Recent reports say that the Samsung flagship will be carrying a voice assistant software in the form of Bixby, which has been developed by the same team that created Apple's Siri. Bixby may be accompanied by another A.I., as Samsung has filed a trademark for Samsung Hello in the European Intellectual Property Office. Aside from dual-camera phones, another mobile trend that will be seen this year is A.I. Samsung Bixby is supposed to be the South Korean tech company's answer to Google Assistant, while Samsung Hello will be its counterpart for Google Now. According to the trademark filing, Samsung Hello will be a "software that can curate content like games, music, the weather and social news based on user preferences." In addition to that, the software will be able to "learn what you like and customize a feed to serve you this content." Samsung Bixby And Samsung Hello The patent filing also says that Samsung Hello will provide "personalized features and information based on user's preferences in the fields of weather, music, entertainment, games, travel, science, health, contact, and social news via voice command and voice recognition." Based on the description of the patent, Samsung Hello will be able to provide information at a glance based on the habits and preferences of its user, and will be similar to Google Now and HTC BlinkFeed. For the uninitiated, Google Now is an A.I. that uses geographic location, search history, and emails in order to come up with its personal recommendations to its users. It is not clear on how the Bixby will tie in with Samsung Hello. It is possible that they're one and the same. It is also possible that Samsung Hello won't be a stand-alone A.I. assistant, and will just be an extension of Bixby. It is pure speculation at this point, and we won't know for sure until Samsung's flagship launches by Mar. 29 at a New York City event. Other Samsung Galaxy S8 Updates In other Samsung Galaxy S8 updates, an earlier Tech Times report says that the 5.8-inch Galaxy S8 will have a 3,000mAh battery, while the battery for the 6.2-inch model will have 3,500mAh. Neowin also reports that it has uncovered the logo for Bixby, which closely resembles the letter 'B' and the number '8.' TAG Samsung Galaxy S8, Samsung Bixby, Samsung Hello, Google Now, A.I.

The company launched its 2017 lineup of smart TVs at the Consumer Electronics Show 2017 in Las Vegas last month. They are predictably powered by Android TV. Google did say recently that the artificial intelligence-powered Google Assistant will soon make its way to TVs as well and Sony has now confirmed that its 2017 smart TV series is going to be the first to feature Google Assistant. Customers who rush out the door to purchase one of Sony’s new 2017 Bravia TVs should keep in mind that they won’t be able to use Google Assistant on their new TV right away. That’s because Google Assistant does not come installed on the TV straight out of the box. According to a report, Google Assistant is actually going to be added via a firmware update at some point “later this year.” Once Google Assistant goes like for Android TV, users will be able to invoke it using a special button on the remote control. Those who own a Google Home speaker will even be able to control their Sony TV via voice commands for doing tasks such as changing source inputs, launching apps, adjusting the volume or just changing the channel. Neither Sony nor Google has confirmed when Assistant is finally going to be released for compatible TVs this year. Filed in Gadgets. Read more about CES, CES 2017, Google, google assistant and Sony.

Finally, you get the funding for a new one. The team’s been working together for weeks and you’re finally ready to re-launch. Where do you start? The website relaunch process is a critical time for SEO. It  involves planning, transition, and post-launch phases of activities to ensure that previously earned relevancy and authority are transferred from the old site to the new. Also to make sure there are no hidden issues that tank rankings and traffic. The three phases will take a varying level of resources and time depending on the size of the site, as well as the goals of the site. A 50-page informational site will be much easier than a 50,000-page e-commerce website in many regards. Note that I’m assuming the new site is mobile-friendly and the UX team confirms it passes Google’s testing tools–a given in 2017. Website Relaunch SEO Planning Excel File Phase 1: Planning This phase is crucial to project success. Speaking from experience, the goal is for the re-launch to be a well-planned process absent of surprises. In the planning phase, there are several important initiatives: Page URLs Keyword mapping Title and meta descriptions Canonical tags Planning doesn’t have to be fancy or elaborate. It can be as simple as starting with an Excel file plotting page URLs for the new site. Hopefully up to this point a sitemap has been developed that you can work from. If you have a development or staging site in place, you can likely run Screaming Frog or your crawler of choice to export the HTML page files. And if you’re not getting results when trying to crawl, it’s likely your developer is doing the right thing and disallowing all robots from indexing the site with a disallow “all” in the robots.txt file (robotstxt.org is a great resource). You might need to remove this for a moment while you crawl the site. Once the URL list for the new site is set, you can make updates in your Excel file to optimize based on content structure and desired page groupings. You’ll likely need to work with your UX team and developer on this. From the page list, it’s easy to identify the pages that carry over from the old site and those that will change. Now you’re ready to identify the pages and sections that should be targeted for specific keywords. After identifying the pages and focus keywords/topics on the new site, it is time to plan or write title and meta description tags. If you have a static site or one that requires manual tag writing, this is the time to get to work. Write custom tags for each page and tailor them to the focus keyword(s) and relevant topics of the page. Don’t forget to follow best practices on the character length (Moz has helpful information for titles and descriptions). If you have a large site or one that’s very data-driven, you will likely need to write formulas for the tags you want for your development team. For example, on an e-commerce site, write tag structure for category, sub-category, and product pages. This will include a lot of fill-in-the-blank slots from the database for the developer to map specific fields as well. The last aspect of the planning phase requires questions of the technology you’re using on the new site, and of your development and IT teams. It’s the canonical aspects of the site to ensure that the search engines properly see one site for indexing. Beyond the more obvious needs where there’s known duplicate content (products in multiple categories), it’s important to understand if URLs with and without trailing slashes render as separate pages or redirect to one another. Additionally, the root domain global 301s are important to plan and talk through at this phase. Changing these after the re-launch can be a risky and painful process. Switching all URLs to https after the fact can be a much bigger deal than it seems. Phase 2: Transition The second phase of SEO for a relaunch includes: 301 redirects XML sitemap Robots.txt These items may start prior to launch and possibly alongside planning items, but they’ll be a focus when the site actually launches. 301 redirects are the most important aspect of a relaunch. I always expect to be on call when a site launches to catch missed 301s and other issues that arise. It’s important to plan–using the spreadsheet discussed earlier or other similar methods–to map out the old site pages to the most relevant new site page. In some cases, this is a straightforward process–and in other projects, it can take days or weeks of work. To track down all old URLs that need to be redirected, don’t just crawl and look at the old (current) website. Do a “site” operator search in Google, and look at Google Search Console and Bing Webmaster Tools to see what URLs the search engines index and deem important. Create this list and hand it to your dev team or implement it yourself through the CMS. Once the site launches, you need to go back to your redirects list and spot check the old site links to make sure the redirects took effect. Make note of those that go to 404 pages or have issues. Also, make sure they are 301 redirects and not other server codes–there are a bunch of web based tools like redirectcheck.com to help you verify. Lastly, go back and perform that “site” search in Google again and click on links throughout the results pages to make sure nothing was missed or configured improperly at launch. When your redirects are in good shape, it’s time to crawl the site and develop a new XML sitemap if one isn’t already automatically generated by your CMS. Whether it’s a dynamic or static sitemap, I strongly encourage you to manually review it. Make sure it’s void of duplicate or 404 page URLs. This is an important step because the search engines lose trust in your sitemap if there are errors. When your sitemap file is in good shape and you have a solid robots.txt file on the site, it’s time to submit their locations to Google Search Console and Bing Webmaster Tools. Phase Three: Post-Launch With the launch phase complete, it’s time audit and test the site with these steps: Redirects audit Canonical audit GSC/BWT tests & submissions 30-day auditing 404s Tag issues Canonicals Indexing issues Content and ranking issues Overall traffic issues In this final phase, some steps will repeat to include review of URLs, tags, canonical structures, redirects, and more. After all, there’s nothing worse than doing the right stuff to this point only to realize a month later that a minor detail was missed and traffic tanked. Fortunately, Google and Bing provide great diagnostic information in GSC/BWT to make it easy to keep an eye on progress. Google Analytics also can help you to quickly flag any drops in traffic or problems. It’s critical to monitor the health of the site and the implementation of planned and transition activities at least weekly after launch. This will ensure the search engines give the new site credit for relevancy, the authority status of your old site, plus the enhancements you made for the relaunch. Don’t waste the time and approvals it took for your team to do a relaunch. Try a three-phased approach like this one to ensure the new site has a firm SEO foundation and promising future to provide a return on investment and opening new opportunities for your SEO strategy.

As a result, millions of Clash of Clans players will need to know how to transfer their game to a new phone. Below is a quick how to guide explaining what players need to know before making the switch, and how to do it. Be careful though, or you could lose an entire village. Advertisement Clash of Clans is one of the most popular games on Android and iOS and has been for years, even though Clash Royale is stealing some of its players. With millions of downloads on each platform, many will need to know how to transfer their account. Read: Clash of Clans Hacks: 3 Things You Should Know One question we keep getting is regarding how to transfer the game from one phone to another. Since everything is server side with the developer, Supercell, it isn’t just a copy/paste job. However, moving your Clash of Clans progress from one phone to another, playing on a second tablet, or switching from Android to an iPhone and more. It all can be done, so watch the quick video guide below. To be specific, this guide is how to transfer a Clash of Clans village to a new Android device, and we’ll briefly mention iOS and Game Center as well. You’ll need to download Clash of Clans on your new phone or tablet, sign into Google Games (or Apple’s Game Center) and you’re nearly done. We can even skip the tutorial now, and get right into the transfer. Being able to play Clash of Clans on my phone while out and about or while sitting on the couch, then picking up right where I left off on my tablet is an awesome feature. The entire experience is seamless, and very consistent. Being cross-platform also helps, because you can easily transfer from iOS to Android as well, or vice-versa. Meaning you can play the same village on you Android phone and iPad, switch to new devices and more. Advertisement Instructions With iOS and Game Center you’ll need a device linking code, but overall the process is still extremely easy and only takes a few moments, however, you’ll need both devices side by side to enter the code. More on that below. With Android, transferring your Clash of Clans game information couldn’t be easier thanks to Google Play Games, and Google+. All you have to do is sync or sign-into Google Games (or Google+) inside the game and it transfers the data over and saves it. Download Clash of Clans on your new smartphone or tablet, then follow the steps from the video below. It’s worth mentioning that if you buy gems on the newly loaded game, or progress past a level 4 Town Hall, you can’t transfer your game data. So keep that in mind. Plus, who would want to start all over again anyways? Read: Clash of Clans May Update: What to Know The video below was filmed with an older version of the game, but very similar options and settings apply here in 2016. The steps are also slightly different for iOS. Advertisement As you can see from the video above, it all takes under a minute. Simply hit the three gears “settings” button near the bottom right of the display, and connect to Google Games by hitting the “Google+ Sign-in” button, or saying ok to the Google Games popup. Once you connect to Google on the new device it will automatically sign you into Google Play Games, and find your existing game data. You’ll get a notification asking if you’d like to transfer your base, then just go ahead and select yes. Make sure it says the correct village Town Hall level before clicking Yes. Use caution, and make sure it’s loading the correct game. If you’ve started multiple different villages Google Games may have the wrong one backed up. If this for some reason doesn’t work head into settings > accounts > Google > and tap on your Google account. From here you’ll want to make sure your phone is syncing data to Google. Make sure Google+ and Google App Data sync is enabled, and you’re all set. Then try the steps from the video one more time. I used the steps above to transfer my game data from a Galaxy S4 when I first started playing, to multiple devices I use today. Currently I play Clash on the Note 5, Galaxy S7 Edge, and Pixel C tablet. All the same village. Being able to easily transfer the entire game in seconds, and enjoy the same awesome experience on an array of devices, is pretty awesome. As for iOS, the steps are somewhat different. Rather than doing all the sync options above, you’ll need to get a code from the “Old Device, New Device” pop-up from the video above. On an old device like the iPhone 5s hit settings and select “Old Device” and write down the code provided, or keep it nearby. Advertisement Now, download and open Clash of Clans on a new iPhone 6s or iPad Mini, select “New Device” and enter the code provided. This will transfer the game over on iOS. Users have 5 minutes to enter the code, so don’t waste time. The village will now be on both devices. Uninstall the game on your old phone, or play on both, it’s up to you. The same steps apply to add a village from your iPhone to an iPad to play on both. Again, recent updates in 2016 could have changed this, but the steps remain about the same. This same process also works for switching Clash of Clans from Android to iPhone, or from iPhone to Android. The code method is the safest and easiest choice. If you run into problems, below are some helpful tips. If possible, write down your username, TH level, experience level, Clan name, and even your Clan tag #. This all can be helpful for the Supercell support team in locating a lost or missing village in case of problems. And yes, they can help users recover a lost base, but it may take more than a few days for a reply. Read: 10 Common Clash of Clans Problems & Fixes Advertisement If you’re a Windows Phone user wondering if this is possible for you, no, sadly it is not. The game has yet to launch on Windows Phone, but it could in the near future. More details regarding transferring your village and game can also be found from the developers forum. For any and all details about this game, check out our Clash of Clans Portal. Are you still playing Clash of Clans, or did you move on to Clash Royale?

Thank you and hope it can be possible. 08/29/2014 Katherine Reply The only problem that I faced while playing this game on my Smartphone is its battery get drain out soon. So I recently purchased a 6 Port USB Charger through which I can charge up to 6 Android as well as iOS based Smartphones simultaneously in any ratio with rapid charging process. It has capacity of 10 Amps. 08/29/2014 Jerah Reply Thanks but I needed help and that’s off topic. Lol 09/19/2014 ryan Reply i want to move it from my samsung s3 to my ipone 6+ is it the same thanks 09/19/2014 Jerah Reply Hi Ryan, you can transfer your Clash Of Clans data from your GS3 to your iPhone 6+ if you don’t have a Town Hall level 4 or above or didn’t buy any coins.

I haven’t been able to play since the update and it’s pretty much left me with withdrawal symptoms. the need to upgrade, research, donate to my muchly needing clan members has really got to me. that much so Iv had to start a new base just to be involved. im now th7 already without spending a penny. i’v kinda rushed my way there because from being half way through th9 with a strong defensive base I’m missing the troops I was used to cooking and attacking with. some of my clan are close behind me due to new updates with th holding more loot plus all the other game changing updates. I won’t be spending ££ on the Base I have had to inconveniently resort to I must say. but if you can help me with recovering my official well earned 1 of a kind strategic th9 profile then il be happy to spend my hard earned money on starting some well needed upgrades that are well over due. i also can not remember the right google play details to transfer it to any other device. i know everything else that can prove that it’s my property ie (email address for payments I have made from, clan members etc) please SUPERCELL I need your help to recover or transfer to me. thanks in advance. anybody else having the same problem? advice much appreciated! 01/17/2016 brendon taylor Reply a Taylor thing is my Base that is being deprived of attention. hate seeing attackers steal from the always full collectors without any bombs going off or x bows doing their job :( take your time to have a look, even join my clan if your in need of clan. 01/26/2016 Annhfranklin Reply 0=0006my co-worker’s aunt makes $83 hourly on the internet .

My IPad was stolen so obviously I can’t sign in on the old device and support keep asking for more and more things. Hopefully they get it sorted soon. 02/22/2016 Matthew Jackson Reply They need your username, clan name, exact Xp then a screenshot of your first gem ever purchase if you made any. Other things that help are knowing where and when you first loaded the game or other specifics. I hope this helps you and you get your base back like I hope to. 02/24/2016 Matthew Jackson Reply Hey Brendon. I feel your pain and more. Try playing for years then just when they finally make a significant upgrade including finally level 11 Town hall you go and lose your iPad. Help won’t let me into my base even after sending the information and my first purchase because it doesn’t match with their records apparently. Starting again would be horrible. When you have max level defenses and troops almost going back to level one Is a crushing blow. So I might have to retire. It will give me so much time for other things and with a busy job maybe it is for the best. 02/27/2016 Cienna Reply You care supposed to be able to get your game back on your own if you saved it like supercell recommends. If you saved it on Game Center while you played it on your iOS device then log into Game Center on your new IOS device first. You should see coc listed as one of your games. Now download and install coc. Follow prompts and it will ask you to load your old game. If you saved it on android with Google+ or google play your new android device will give you option to sign into that and load old village. If your new device is android and old was iOS or was IOS and now Android you have to link them first through the CoC game settings to get your village to load. If you don’t have your old device and didn’t link them but did save them only way I know is to find someone who has a device same as your old type of OS and doesn’t play clash of clans to allow you to download the game on their device. For iOS Sign out of their Game Center and then sign into Game Center with your account. Download CoC and once your game is up link it to Android device. For Android use their phone to load CoC and after sign in with your google play and link your new IOS. Once done they can just delete CoC from their device. I have also used an emulator for Android called Blue Stacks on a computer and then linked an IOS device. If you never saved your game then supercell is only one who can help. 03/04/2016 Rosie Reply How can I transfer my y clash of clans from my iPhone 5s to an iPhone 6s?

Is Nexus 6P a Viable Choice Further on the Road? By Christopher McCandles / February 9, 2017 / Phones No Comments on Is Nexus 6P a Viable Choice Further on the Road? 131 Last year Google launched its latest Pixel lineup. The arrival of these devices meant that Google wants to end the Nexus era. While the Android parent is slowly but surely doing its best to kill off the Nexus brand, one Nexus smartphone is still selling very well. Nexus 6P is the device we’re talking about. In fact, Nexus 6P used to be the best that Google had to offer until Pixel and Pixel XL were launched. Today we’re going to go over Nexus 6P’s specs and see why it is still a good smartphone choice despite its age. Nexus 6P: Hardware Performance Google chose Huawei to be Nexus 6P’s manufacturer and this proved to be a good choice. The smartphone is equipped with only high end hardware parts and this is what makes it still a viable choice this day. The smartphone actually brings a major improvement in terms of hardware performance in comparison with its predecessor Nexus 5X. With that being said, let’s take a look under Nexus 6P’s hood and see what we can find. The smartphone is fueled by the highly powerful Qualcomm octa-core Snapdragon 810 chipset. The processor has been coupled with an Adreno 530 graphics processing unit and 3GB of RAM. Additionally, the device ships in the following storage space variants 32GB, 64GB and 128 GB. Nexus 6P: Battery Life Because the smartphone is quite big measuring in at 5.7 inches, Huawei was able to equip it with a huge battery. The large 3,450 mAh battery is one of Nexus 6P’s main selling points. The Chinese manufacturer has optimized the battery to last for multiple hours when put under heavy usage such as HD video streaming. Nexus 6P: Price Leaving the specs aside, this is what makes Nexus 6P so popular. One of Nexus 6P’s strongest points are that it can be acquired for the affordable price of $399. Keeping in mind that this smartphone is fitted with a large 5.7 inch QHD AMOLED display and an octa-core processor, this price is really impressive. Worth mentioning is that customers will also receive Google’s latest operating system alongside all of Nexus 6P’s specs.

The device managed to become quite popular along the way. It sold millions of units bringing huge amounts of profits to Google and LG. While the device definitely is an overall good purchase, it does come with some unwanted flaws. It looks like Nexus 5 is filled with some major design issues that cause it to randomly shut down and restart. In case you own a Nexus 5 and your device is affected by this reboot bug, you came to the right place. There are a bunch of reasons that makes the smartphone to randomly shutdown. On the bright side, there are also a couple of fixes. Today we’re going to go over them together and see how you can repair your Nexus 5. Nexus 5: Repairing The Power Button One of the flaws in Nexus 5’s design is that it was equipped with a fairly weak power button. Because the smartphone is quite old, there are high chances that the power button might be broken. This is quite a major issue since the internal switch is placed beneath the physical power button. Surprisingly, repairing the power button actually fixed this issue for most Nexus 5 users. We advise Nexus 5 users to first try and clean their button before heading over to the repair shop. It is possible that the button might be jammed by dirt or even pocket lint. Users can clean their button by using a simple Q-tip that’s been dipped in isopropyl alcohol. Worth mentioning is that the Q-tip shouldn’t be soaked in alcohol. Using the Q-tip, users can swipe the sides of the button until the dust is cleaned off. There is another nonconventional way of cleaning the button. Nexus 5 users can always give it a good press. There is a small chance that by smacking the button, all the debris that’s keeping it stuck will be pushed out. If none of the above mentioned solutions work, all that’s left is to take the device to a repair shop.

Well, it looks like despite popular belief Google is still paying attention to its Nexus devices. Not all of them though. The US based tech giant recently launched its latest Android 7.1.2 Nougat beta software update. This update is being referred to as being an incremental maintenance release but it’s also bringing some cool features. Nexus 5X and Nexus 6P are the ones that are going to benefit from the features brought by Android 7.1.2 Nougat. These devices will be finally put up to par with Google’s latest Pixel and Pixel XL features. The reason we are saying this is because Google Assistant and fingerprint gestures support will be added to Nexus 5X and Nexus 6P. Sadly, Android 7.1.2 Nougat also marks the date when the older Nexus 6 and Nexus 9 will officially stop being supported. Although, this shouldn’t shock anyone since both are getting close to reaching their three year milestone. Worth mentioning is that Google will still keep on providing Nexus 6 and Nexus 9 with the highly important monthly security updates for the whole year. Being able to receive Google’s Android security updates is one of the best things about owning an Android powered device. Even though Google keeps security tight, some threats still manage to slip through the cracks. This is where the monthly security patches come in. Now back to Nexus 5X and Nexus 6P. Both devices user experience level will be greatly increased with the addition of Google Assistant. This will allow users to completely control their devices through vocal commands. Google Assistant has been designed with one purpose in mind, to allow users to place calls, set appointments and many more only through vocal commands. The addition of fingerprint gestures support is well received as well. Nexus 5X and Nexus 6P users can take advantage of this feature and access their notifications by simply swiping on their fingerprint sensor. While this might not sound that important, it can be quite useful. Nonetheless maybe when the full version of Android 7.1.2 Nougat will arrive, it might bring additional features such as the Pixel launcher.

It says “Cast Device Not Connected” and is a notification that cannot be removed. Here we will explain what’s causing this and how to get rid of it. Advertisement The problem is Facebook. More specifically, this persistent notification pops up after watching a video on the Facebook Android app. A combination of things makes this happen but we can get rid of it with just a few steps. Thousands of users on Facebook, Twitter and Reddit have reported the problem. Google is also aware of the situation. Trying to swipe it away or hitting the play or X button to close it do nothing. So what’s going on? Read on to learn how to get rid of this pesky irritating notification. Facebook will soon be releasing an update that will enable full Google Chromecast support. Meaning users can cast video from Facebook to their TV with any Chromecast device or Android TV. This is a feature that is coming soon, or was just released and appears to be broken. We’re not completely sure. Combine that with Google just updating Google Cast to Google Home, and the two aren’t playing well together. Luckily there’s an easy way to get rid of the above notification. Temporarily, and for good. Whether you know what Chromecast is or not, here’s how to fix the problem. Advertisement On November 1st Facebook released an update on the Google Play Store for Android users, which appears to have fixed this problem. If you’re still experiencing this, go update your apps on the Play Store. Or download the latest version here. Clear “Cast Device Not Connected” Notification Tap on the notification popup and Facebook will open Disable Facebook popups by unchecking Allow Notifications Alternatively long-press the popup and then choose to Force Stop Facebook Users who are experiencing this can simply press the popup (or long press) and choose to turn off notifications for Facebook. This removes the problem, but now you won’t receive any notifications from the social network. That isn’t ideal for most, so continue reading for other ideas. A temporary fix is to head into Settings > Applications > Default or Manage Applications > then scroll down to Facebook. Once you find it, click the app and tap “Force Close” as shown above. Or Force Stop. This forces the app to close and kills the persistent notification millions are experiencing. However, the next time you watch a video on Facebook it will come back. Advertisement Another option is to go to Settings > Notifications > and scroll down to Home. It’s a house-shaped icon in multiple colors. Disable that. Those who haven’t updated the app will need to search for Google Cast, and disable notifications for that application. For now this seems to be the best route, unless you’ve installed the latest Facebook app update. Another method is to install the Facebook Beta for Android, or a third party app completely. Like Swipe for Facebook, which is a far better app than the official one from Facebook themselves. Are you still experiencing this problem? Let us know in the comment section below. 5 Responses 11/01/2016 docooper Reply Samsung Galaxy S7, Android 6.01, press left tab button, then close all tabs. On the home screen press the active apps widget and close all apps. Notification goes away. Much easy process for a temp fix. 11/02/2016 Cory Gunther Reply Clearing all running apps doesn’t fix it on my Galaxy S7 Edge. I don’t have an active apps widget either. Only in recent apps button by the fingerprint scanner. None of those fix it. Interesting. Anyone experiencing this on something other than Android? 11/03/2016 Jesse Kona Reply Disabling notifications for Facebook fixed my Samsung Galaxy Tab S.

Google to bring Google Assistant to older Android phones? by Joe Roberts 12 February 2017 0 shares Read Comments Google's latest attempt to crack the smartphone market, the Google Pixel, arrived alongside a new AI assistant, suitably named Google Assistant. At the time, the company decided not to reveal too much about bringing the feature to other Android phones, leaving us in the dark about the assistant's future. Google Assistant is currently only available on the Pixel and the Pixel XL, but recently we've been hearing more about the feature coming to the Nexus 6P and Nexus 5X, with some rumours suggesting LG will utilise Google's assistant for the upcoming LG G6. Related: MWC 2017 But now, code in a new alpha release of the Google app for Android suggests the assistant could make its way to older Android phones in the near future. As AndroidPolice reports, the code basically would allow Google Assistant to be added to any phone, which bodes well for a larger rollout. The Google Pixel It looks like the alpha release was launched by mistake, and those who have installed the latest version are reporting the usual bugs and problems that come with such an early release. In other words, we're far from an official announcement, let alone launch, for the Google Assistant on older devices. That said, some users are reporting they have been able to get the Google Assistant welcome screen to appear on their older devices using the same long press on the home button that was used for Google Now and the assistant on the Pixel. The welcome screen doesn't seem to work on all devices consistently, however. But with this being an alpha release, that's to be expected at this stage. MWC is due to take place at the end of this month, so we could hear more about a larger assistant rollout then, though it's more likely Google will release more information at Google I/O, which gets underway on May 17. Stay tuned for more.

For those who pick up the new LGWatch Sport or LG Watch Style, well, you're in for a treat as well. Google redesigned the interface and added new features that are aimed directly at competing with the Apple Watch, and giving Android fans a more capable wearable. Below are 9 tips and tricks to help you get the most out of Android Wear 2.0. Popular Searches Ralph Lauren Corp RL ▼ 79.17 -0.32 -0.40% Michael Kors Holdings Ltd KORS ▼ 38.05 -0.05 -0.13% Sanderson Farms Inc SAFM ▲ 93.83 +0.82 +0.88% Tyson Foods Inc TSN ▲ 65.33 +0.33 +0.51% 1. Your watch no longer needs your phone  Your watch is now a stand-alone Android device, complete with access to the Play Store. In order to download, update, or use Google services and apps on your watch you'll need to add a Google account to it. The first time you power on a device running Android Wear 2.0 you will see a prompt asking you to add your Google account to the watch. Adding your account is easy, just follow the prompts in the Android Wear app on your phone. 2. Basic navigation Android Wear 2.0 still relies heavily on gestures and taps for navigation. However, the functionality of button(s) on the watch will be different for each model of watch. It's a good idea to go through the tutorial after updating your watch. The tutorial will show you which button does what, assuming your device has more than one. If there is only one button, then view it as a home button. Some basic navigation tips I found useful are: - Swipe from the left-edge of the display to go back one screen. - Swipe down from the tap of the screen to view an app's menu. - The main button on your watch should function as a home button with a quick press, and bring up Assistant with a long-press. 3. Install apps Since your watch no longer relies on your phone, you now have access to a dedicated Android Wear Play Store on your wrist. First, launch the Play Store and agree to the terms and services. A list of apps with pending updates will show up, followed by a list of apps you have installed on your phone that also offer an Android Wear version. You can search, browse by category, and discover apps built specifically for your watch. 4. Manage complications Android Wear watch faces now include complications, giving you an app shortcut or glanceable information without having to actually launch an app. For example, a complication for the Calendar app puts your next appointment on your watch face at all times. Or you can set Google Fit to constantly show your step total for the day. Customize complications with a long press on the watchface, then tapping on the icon for each respective complication. Select the app or info you want the complication to represent, then press the home button to save your settings. 5. Google Assistant Google Assistant, which lets you make voice-based commands is now on Android smartwatches. That means you can get a lot of things done through your watch, without ever touching it. Long-press the power button on your watch to activate Assistant, and then ask questions or give commands. Swipe up from the bottom of the Assistant screen for suggestions of what you can ask and do with Assistant. Tailor how Google Assistant functions on your Android Wear watch by opening the Wear app on your phone and tap on the Settings icon. Under the Assistant section, tap on Settings. 6. Quickly change your look With a quick swipe to the right or left across your watch face you can switch between faces with ease. It's a quick gesture to switch between, say, a watchface for work, complete with complications that you can use while on the job and another watchface for workouts, encouraging you to run faster. A swipe up or down on a saved watchface will delete it. 7. New app layout When viewing your watchface, press the power button to view your app list. On the LG Watch Style and Watch Sport, the digital crown scrolls through the list of installed apps. On other watches, you'll need to use gestures to scroll up or down to view your apps. Naturally, tapping on an app will launch it. More importantly, you can now pin apps to the top of the list with a long-press on its icon. 8. Two keyboards You now have two new options tools to help you respond to messages from the watch. There's a teeny-tiny keyboard that's nearly impossible to type on (at least in my experience), and then there's a handwriting recognition tool that lets you scribble words on the display. The next time you compose a message or reply, tap on the keyboard icon. The default setting is the small keyboard, but you can quickly switch between the two keyboards with a long-press on the keyboard icon. 9. Android Pay Android Pay is currently only available on the LG Watch Sport due to NFC requirements. You can install Android Pay from the Play Store on the watch if it's not already installed. After opening it, you'll need to set up a passcode for your watch. Any time you take the watch off, you will need to enter the code to use it. Not only does this mean a would-be thief won't find much use of your watch, but it stops them from using your Android Pay card.

However, I would take Danny Rose and Kyle Walker from Spurs in a heartbeat, to name just two alternatives. Moses is full of running and puts opposition wingers and full-backs on the back foot, but his crossing and finishing are erratic; Alonso is consistent and more defensively solid, but doesn’t stretch defences in the way the best attacking wing-backs do. Just a thought, and I’m sure some will disagree, but I wouldn’t be surprised to see a couple of new faces in these key slots come September.” I agree - I was just saying that so well has Conte deployed his resources, it can be hard to imagine anyone fitting in better.

And, I remember watching a Marseille-PSG game that season where he was absolutely superb against one of the best midfields in Europe.” Didn’t he get sent-off in the last game?

Baig 3 days ago SHARE SHARE TWEET SHARE EMAIL Drivers warned to stop looking at Northern Lights Kim's brother's autopsy completed as second woman arrested © Getty Images People walk past an advertisement for the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge smartphone on November 1, 2016 in Berlin, Germany. NEW YORK—Ok, Google. Hey, Siri. What's up, Bixby? Bixby doesn’t have the name recognition of Apple’s Siri or the Google Assistant. That might change if rumors suggesting that a digital assistant called Bixby will be the new AI-infused helper inside Samsung’s next big flagship phone prove correct. Samsung is expected to unveil the smartphone, presumably the Galaxy S8, in March, though the South Korean tech giant could tease its arrival later this month during the Mobile World Congress tech confab in Barcelona. One thing that’s obvious: Samsung can’t aim the spotlight on a new phone fast enough, not after the pricey and embarrassing battery-gate debacle that was the Galaxy Note 7. Samsung recently cited design and manufacturing flaws from two unnamed suppliers as the reason some lithium-ion batteries inside the phones caught fire. Whether it is called Bixby or something else, it appears a fresh voice-driven AI assistant will be one of the banner features inside Samsung’s new phone, hardly surprising given the race to raise the IQs for such brainy digital assistants. S-Voice or Viv? Among the outstanding questions is whether Bixby will build on Samsung’s existing (and frankly underwhelming) S-Voice feature, leverage the conversational-based voice technology from Viv Labs, a startup the company bought in October, or apply some combination of the two. I’ve certainly been impressed by early demos of Viv, which was founded by Siri co-creator Dag Kittlaus. But demos are demos and the tech must prove itself in real world use. Equally unknown is how a user might summon Bixby. There could be a dedicated button for such a purpose, or perhaps you'll bark out wake words, along the lines of "OK Google" and "Hey Siri."  Samsung remains mum publicly on Bixby or other features that might be coming to its latest flagship, but there’s certainly no shortage of rumors. The likelihood is that you’ll see not one but two new S8 models, with the larger of the pair pushing screen size well past 6-inches. Samsung’s playbook through the past several iterations of the series has been to introduce a standard Galaxy S model and a Galaxy S version model with a secondary curved edge display. Citing unnamed sources, the Wall Street Journal says there will only be curved display models this time around, albeit in the different screen sizes. . The Journal also said that the fingerprint scanner that’s currently on the home button could be moved to the back of the phone. We'll see. Whatever features end up in a final product, the S8 launch is critical to Samsung. Coming off the Note 7, Samsung must change the narrative on its mobile business. What's more, arch-rival Apple is expected to up its own game later in the year, when it launches the ten-year anniversary edition of the iPhone.  For Samsung's sake, its new AI assistant best be able to live with pressure.

Photo - AFP file x A big logo created from pictures of Facebook users worldwide is pictured in the company's Data Centre, its first outside the US on November 7, 2013 in Lulea, in Swedish Lapland. “Big Data,” as it is known, will undoubtedly deliver important scientific, technological, and medical advances. But Big Data also poses serious risks if it is misused or abused. Photo - AFP file   Sharelines Managing big data’s big risks Managing #big data’s big risks In the last 15 years, we have witnessed an explosion in the amount of digital data available – from the Internet, social media, scientific equipment, smart phones, surveillance cameras, and many other sources – and in the computer technologies used to process it. “Big Data,” as it is known, will undoubtedly deliver important scientific, technological, and medical advances. But Big Data also poses serious risks if it is misused or abused. Already, major innovations such as Internet search engines, machine translation, and image labeling have relied on applying machine-learning techniques to vast data sets. And, in the near-future, Big Data could significantly improve government policymaking, social-welfare programmes, and scholarship. But having more data is no substitute for having high-quality data. For example, a recent article in Nature reports that election pollsters in the United States are struggling to obtain representative samples of the population, because they are legally permitted to call only landline telephones, whereas Americans increasingly rely on cellphones. And while one can find countless political opinions on social media, these aren’t reliably representative of voters, either. In fact, a substantial share of tweets and Facebook posts about politics are computer-generated. In recent years, automated programmes based on biased data sets have caused numerous scandals. For example, last April, when a college student searched Google images for “unprofessional hairstyles for work,” the results showed mostly pictures of black people; when the student changed the first search term to “professional,” Google returned mostly pictures of white people. But this was not the result of bias on the part of Google’s programmers; rather, it reflected how people had labelled pictures on the Internet. A Big Data program that used this search result to evaluate hiring and promotion decisions might penalise black candidates who resembled the pictures in the results for “unprofessional hairstyles,” thereby perpetuating traditional social biases. And this isn’t just a hypothetical possibility. Last year, a ProPublica investigation of “recidivism risk models” demonstrated that a widely used methodology to determine sentences for convicted criminals systematically overestimates the likelihood that black defendants will commit crimes in the future, and underestimates the risk that white defendants will do so. Another hazard of Big Data is that it can be gamed. When people know that a data set is being used to make important decisions that will affect them, they have an incentive to tip the scales in their favour. For example, teachers who are judged according to their students’ test scores may be more likely to “teach to the test,” or even to cheat. Similarly, college administrators who want to move their institutions up in the US News and World Reports rankings have made unwise decisions, such as investing in extravagant gyms at the expense of academics. Worse, they have made grotesquely unethical decisions, such as the effort by Mount Saint Mary’s University to boost its “retention rate” by identifying and expelling weaker students in the first few weeks of school. Even Google’s search engine is not immune. Despite being driven by an enormous amount of data overseen by some of the world’s top data scientists, its results are susceptible to “search-engine optimisation” and manipulation, such as “Google bombing,” “spamdexing,” and other methods serving parochial interests. A third hazard is privacy violations, because so much of the data now available contains personal information. In recent years, enormous collections of confidential data have been stolen from commercial and government sites; and researchers have shown how people’s political opinions or even sexual preferences can be accurately gleaned from seemingly innocuous online postings, such as movie reviews – even when they are published pseudonymously. Finally, Big Data poses a challenge for accountability. Someone who feels that he or she has been treated unfairly by an algorithm’s decision often has no way to appeal it, either because specific results cannot be interpreted, or because the people who have written the algorithm refuse to provide details about how it works. And while governments or corporations might intimidate anyone who objects by describing their algorithms as “mathematical” or “scientific,” they, too, are often awed by their creations’ behavior. The European Union recently adopted a measure guaranteeing people affected by algorithms a “right to an explanation”; but only time will tell how this will work in practice. When people who are harmed by Big Data have no avenues for recourse, the results can be toxic and far-reaching, as data scientist Cathy O’Neil demonstrates in her recent book Weapons of Math Destruction. The good news is that the hazards of Big Data can be largely avoided. But they won’t be unless we zealously protect people’s privacy, detect and correct unfairness, use algorithmic recommendations prudently, and maintain a rigorous understanding of algorithms’ inner workings and the data that informs their decisions. - Project Syndicate < Previous PageNext Page > Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

MSPU Windows Phone Windows 10 Surface Xbox Enterprise Tip us Settings Text Input: Windows 10 Windows Phone Surface Xbox Enterprise Settings Tip us Forum Text Input: CrossOver Android Preview brings Windows apps to Chromebooks 0 by Surur  @mspoweruser Aug 26, 2016 at 18:46 GMT6 months ago Codeweavers has announced that the Tech Preview of CrossOver for Android is now available, allowing ChromeOS users with Intel processors to run Windows applications on their laptops. The app uses WINE API translation technology and supports apps as sophisticated as Office 2010, Quicken and DirectX9 and Steam, but does not support every Windows application. Minimum specs are Android 5, the Google Play store on Chrome, an Intel, not ARM processor and 2 GB of RAM. The APK is being distributed via the Google Play Store where testers can sign up to be beta testers. ChromeOS is a Google-created operating system popular in the US education environment, where much of the world is browser based, but virtually unknown elsewhere. Google has recently added support for Android apps on ChromeOS and brought the Google Play Store to a select number of ChromeOS laptops. This has brought millions of Android apps to the platform, but unfortunately most of these apps are designed for touch, and are not optimised for keyboard and mouse, unlike Windows Applications, making Crossover welcome news for dedicated ChromeOS fans. See the technology in action in a video below: Codeweaver also makes Crossover for the Mac and Linux with the same functionality, suggesting while this development is interesting it is unlikely to have a significant impact on the Windows market.

PHOTO: REUTERS Google launched an offline version of its popular video streaming app called YouTube Go in September last year. The app is designed for areas with limited or poor data connection and allows users to download videos that can be viewed later offline. Pakistanis can now make money on YouTube However, so far Google has limited the release of its app. It selected a few countries and the app is yet to be launched in Pakistan. Luckily, android users can still avail YouTube’s online version by simply installing YouTube Go APK for free from APKMirror. PHOTO: YOUTUBE As with any APK file, users would have to change default security settings on their phone to allow for third party apps to be installed. However, users are advised to switch off the feature once they have downloaded the app. After linking their number, users can browse videos on YouTubeGo and download them as well. The app also provide an option to choose between basic and standard quality, and whether to play a video now or save it for offline viewing later on. PHOTO: YOUTUBE Furthermore, users can also send downloaded videos to nearby users and friends without an internet connection. YouTube launches offline video feature Downloaded videos are saved in a tab placed at the top corner of the app and a pop also shows users how much free space they have left on their smartphone.
