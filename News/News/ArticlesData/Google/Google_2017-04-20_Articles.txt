In an era of rapid information growth and its resulting overload, public libraries are ideally situated to help manage and preserve it all. In a time of mistaken beliefs that all information can be easily and freely found on the internet, public libraries are well placed to help provide actual free and equitable access to and availability of information. As Jeffrey Schnapp and Matthew Battles explain in The Library Beyond the Book: “Access to high-speed broadband networks is unevenly distributed and nowhere a given. Library visits and usage statistics in the information age, rather than contracting, have grown. And the information explosion, far from serving the needs of the burgeoning knowledge economy, intensifies the need for quality information and expertise that libraries and librarians provide.” The internet admittedly plays a significant role in contemporary information production, dissemination, and consumption. But much of the information found online is either of questionable quality or controlled and owned by private interests. Many apparently free online information products and services – from search engines like Google and social media platforms like Facebook – are not necessarily concerned with quality information. They are more focussed on simply facilitating the creation, sharing, and use of almost any kind of information be it legitimate or fake, quality or not. Further, these are not public institutions providing public goods and services. They are private companies providing proprietary products. They are not in business to make information freely and equitably available to all. They are in business to make money. Their focus is on profits and not the public. Their free information-related offerings are therefore not free: they come with a price. The price is usually exacted in effectively taking over one’s personal data, selling advertising space integrated into their stuff, or charging extra or higher prices for premium features. Moreover, the growth of paid subscription services is evidence that there is a demand for what public libraries can offer. Private information companies, whether Google, Facebook, or Netflix, are more concerned with their own private agendas, proprietary rights, and corporate profits rather than public interests. Public libraries, not the internet, are the actual free, equitable, and altruistic information network for all. It is the information network that is for the public instead of for the profits. It is the information network that is devoted to making information available to all instead of only to the few. It is the information network that is committed to long-term access to and preservation of information instead of short-term economic vagaries. Public libraries, in other words, offer quality information; the places, platforms, and devices on which to consume it; and the connectivity with which to access and make use of it. It is public libraries, and not private information companies like Google or Facebook, that perform important civic, educational, and economic roles. They are free public spaces where people can come together, connect, interact, and help build, support, and enrich their communities. They are also places for educational endeavours that present many opportunities for diverse kinds of lifelong learning, literacy development and promotion, and knowledge creation and dissemination. They are also places for economic development that support local businesses and entrepreneurs. Public libraries, not the internet, are the actual free, equitable,and altruistic information network for all As John Palfrey argues in BiblioTech, public libraries play vital roles in public life. For example, they provide “networks of digital media that can be loaned for free, not purchased; ‘makerspaces’ that offer equipment so that people can make instead of simply consume culture; easily accessible and networked archives of national heritage; job-search centres; clinics for the technologically illiterate and refuges for those who cannot afford new media – all of this in addition to their current functions.” Nevertheless, there is a misplaced debate about the future of public libraries as a battle between the traditional and the technological, between paper and pixels, between the physical and the virtual. Yet there is no battle; instead, there is a growing convergence. As Schnapp and Battles note, after all, “in the context of a networked world where the physical and the virtual, the offline and the online, are intertwined with increasing intimacy”. Thus, to be responsive to diverse kinds of information needs, public libraries need to be both traditional, with real-world buildings and services, and technological, with online presences, apps, and features. Public libraries are adapting their collections and services to relevant technological changes by transforming into hybrid public places where the analog and digital are integrated. The New York Public Library exemplifies this hybrid approach. In ‘How libraries can compete with Google and Amazon’, Sonali Kohli describes how the reach of the New York Public Library “extends beyond the walls of its 65 physical branches. Dotting the borough are thousands of New Yorkers logged into their own mini-libraries, using the library’s mobile app to do research for homework, or the WiFi hotspots they checked out to fill in the holes in broadband access at home, or accessing e-books on one of the libraries’ tablets they can take home”. Throughout the country, library initiatives are emerging to keep up with technological advances. Public libraries, after all, transform people through access to information, whether through access to books, digital products and services, electronic devices, or wifi connections. Public libraries, moreover, are devoted to the long-term preservation of information. Although private information companies may help create, collect, present, and manage information, they are not necessarily concerned about most of that information’s long-term availability or existence. They may not care about the implications on and for information if their businesses are shuttered or their own systems, services, or devices are discontinued. The priorities, projects, and profits of these private information companies are subject to the vagaries of business needs and economic changes. Public libraries, however, are committed to helping ensure that information is available and accessible for both the present and the future. They offer what private information companies and the internet do not provide: the collection, maintenance, management, and preservation of information for the long-term. Unlike private companies, they are in the forever business insofar as information is concerned. Public libraries matter more than ever in this internet age. As Palfrey argues, “an overwhelming amount of information, access to which is marked by the same stark inequality that exists between economic classes, demands to be moderated for the public good, and libraries are the institutions that do that”. It is public libraries instead of private information companies that help fulfill information’s many promises for our lives and world.

Plastc joins the likes of Coin, declaring bankruptcy Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/04/20 2:39pm PDTApr 20, 2017 14 Plus 1 on G+ 45 Share on Facebook 41 Share on Twitter Total Shares100 News Some of you might remember Plastc. They were a company that jumped on the re-programmable credit card train Coin and Google Wallet started in '13 and '12, respectively. They may have been a bit later to the game in 2014 after even Google had decided that it wasn't a good idea anymore, but they made the attempt. Later even the funding-successful Coin had to close shop due to delays, problems, and a general failure to properly keep up with the market. Unlike Coin, though, Plastc never managed to actually deliver on a product. And now just like its forebears, Plastc has decided it's time to die. This news isn't entirely surprising. Plastc's preorder update messages started verging on the Saygus-esqe: making promises of more features and upgrades, and fewer mentions of actual dates. The Plastc subreddit even decided seven months ago that the business had become a scam and was recommending people to steer clear. The company nonetheless raised in excess of $ 9 million in preorders, which is quite a lot to cut and run with. Plastc, unlike Coin, never actually managed to make or deliver a product to anyone who purchased it. Hopefully at least some of the money is left to return to backers. If not, given the quantity of cash there's always the chance of a decent lawsuit against whatever or whoever is left standing after the bankruptcy settles. The full details of their message to those who preordered are too long to quote here, but their bankruptcy statement is included below.Feel free to check out the full details at the source link. We Regret to Inform You... For the past 3 years, our mission here at Plastc was to build and deliver the most technically ambitious smart card on the planet. After making enormous leaps in development, product innovation and progress towards our goal, Plastc has exhausted all of its options to raise the money it needs to continue. Plastc, Inc. is exploring options to file Chapter 7 Bankruptcy and will cease operations on April 20, 2017. While we have fallen short of our goal, we are proud of our team and the effort that went into developing a working Plastc Card. However, without the necessary capital to continue, all employees have been let go, which means that Customer Care and Social Media channels are unmanned or have been shut down.

Is there any recourse to a refund at this point? David Ruddock Declaring bankruptcy probably doesn't bode well for refunds, no. KlausWillSeeYouNow No kidding...But what about people who submitted a refund request before they declared bankruptcy that was never answered? That's the boat I'm in. Ryne Hager Bankruptcy might interfere with that. Thankfully there's always the potential recourse of personal liability on the part of whoever owned the joint. That's gonna depend on something like a class action, though. Christina B. Try your bank and claim fraud. If that don't work a class action lawsuit has been started. Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ You can always try to get your bank or credit card issuer to do a chargeback. Technically they aren't supposed to do it beyond a certain point, but under certain circumstances they may do it for you, even after a couple of years. infiniteh I'm so glad that I got my refund when I did. Aaron Huffman I 'pre ordered' and I've been very excited for it for so long however there is a big thing I have on this. All these news entries are saying raised $9M from backers or pre orders and all that however near the end of the pre order email I have it shows plain as day just as my bank statements: "Your card will be charged at time of shipping." tldr; I was not charged a dime because they weren't shipping. Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ There seems to be differing stories on this. Some email screenshots in /r/plastc don't show that line in the email and the posters have claimed they were in fact charged. If you didn't get charge, count yourself lucky you won't have to deal with the headache of losing $150 and trying to get it back. Aaron Huffman That's all between Stripe payment and Plastc because things just have been working the way they should for me also the Plastc charge has been a gut feeling in me for about 3 years to always keep that $150 in my bank account so I can get my shipment on time when they are ready because I'm not the best at my finances yet. I've been watching my emails and bank like a hawk waiting for either a charge, an update or a decline on my card from Plastc. sbeaulieu Was sure this was a second post about Saygus Ryne Hager Thank David for the picture idea. crutchcorn Why is Mr. Davenport standing on the tombstone?

Even with multi-user support, Google Home can't create reminders or calendar appointments Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/04/20 1:39pm PDTApr 20, 2017 31 Plus 1 on G+ 20 Share on Facebook 40 Share on Twitter Total Shares91 Google Google Home News Videos Google announced multi-user support for Google Home earlier today, but it's only launching in the US right now. This is finally a chance for Google to rectify things and add all those features Home was lacking at launch, and indeed Google has included a few new features. We're still missing some big ones, though. You still cannot create a reminder or add events to your calendar. After going through the setup process for multi-user, Google Home has access to some of your personal account information. That allows you to ask questions about what's on your calendar, view photos tied to your Google Photos account, and so on. However, writing data to your account appears to be a sticking point. If you try to create a reminder or a calendar appointment, Home tells you it can't do that yet, just like it did before. Hopefully the addition of multi-user support will let Google add these very basic features soon. Seriously, adding something to your calendar has to be one of the most common tasks for a human assistant. It's certainly not impossible to do this stuff, either. Assistant on the phone can create reminders and events just fine. Tags Google google assistant google home video subscribe ...

I'll make millions (of reminders)! Good_Ole_Pinocchio Google can't even handle the basics of their own services here.....SAD! lzdking Make Google Great Again! #MGGA mark555055d Such a disappointment. Google better start ramping up the functions on this thing or it will fail. Also, if they do something stupid like releasing a Google home 2 anytime soon, the shit will fly. LondonLeedsFan I thought about Google Home 2 about 3 days after buying this one and realising it doesn't do so much... I can't help but think it's going to happen. mark555055d Yeah... i could totally see them doing something stupid like making a GH2, with bluetooth pairing capability, improving the mics and speaker, charging $30 more for it, and then giving it an "exclusive" software version that allows reminders and calendar support, all while leaving the GH1 back for months due to "hardware differences". LondonLeedsFan IMO something like this should not be on a 1 or 2 year upgrade cycle. If that's how it goes, I'll leave it! Pete Still no assistant on my Nexus 5X in the UK! LondonLeedsFan Have you set phone language to English US and got latest play services? That will basically push it to your phone within 5 minutes. Pete Latest Play Services (even gone for the beta), same with Google app. As for language, tried that & it didn't work, but why should I? They say it's available in the UK and various other manufacturers (Samsung, OnePlus etc) have made it available on theirs, but Google haven't rolled it out to Nexus devices over here yet. A farce. LondonLeedsFan I have a 6P in the UK and I've had it for about 6 weeks now. Strange. Roderick Gadellaa I don't have it on my Moto X 2014 either and I updated the Google app, Play Services and even edited the build.prop. Somehow it's not working for everyone yet. That said, on the Moto X it may be Moto Voice that's the problem because it also prevents Ok Google hotword detection from anywhere but the Google app itself - it doesn't even work in Google Now On Tap although the searchbar says "Say OK Google". Leonardo Baez create reminder to bitch about you. :,D brian. Careful, she'll turn that insult on you... sbeaulieu The biggest problem assistant got is support. Only one country(officialy). dcdttu Gotta have one before the other, maybe. So that's what they hopefully are going to do next. pfmiller Once you can distinguish between users that's all you should need for both reading and writing appointments. I'm wondering if they are not fully confident in the reliability of the multiple user recognition, so they figure implementing read-only functions is safer while they work on getting the reliability up. denisu So, am I right in saying it can only make calendar disappointments? elchuby Can't even do that.

I'm more excited to find out how they intend to handle messaging, though. surethom I'm sorry but why can Google not do the most simplest things. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Because they're a bunch of overpaid prima donnas who think they're geniuses but can't even match what a simple diligent grunt coder can do. M6 Over 90% of those grunt coders you mention probably couldn't write a simple service that serves a 'hello world' webpage at the thousands of QPS that Google's least popular services have to handle. Most of the work done to spin up such a service are done by SREs not SWEs. This is why start ups can add features so quickly. They simply don't have that many users and can worry about scalability after they get popular, and they have months if not years to work out a scalable solution in the meantime. Also, most grunt coders that add features quickly end up accumulating vast amounts of technical debt in the code they write. Morten Ulv Readers of Android Police are highly trained in pitchforking and kneejerk reactions. No critical thought allowed here, get out! abqnm If I hired an assistant and he or she couldn't add appointments to my calendar, I'd fire that motherfucker on the spot. I guess it must be time to get jobs at Google. Because they sure as shit don't know what an assistant is or what they are supposed to be able to do. Morten Ulv I'm sure they are not aware of the problem and that you would totally be fix it in 5 minutes. That's how it is, I'm sure! Lateef Alabi-Oki I'm just glad that the multiuser support works as well as it does. It hasn't failed in distinguishing the voices in my household. My spouse told it to show pictures from Google Photos and it executed. It's truly magical. Forgive my honeymoon phase. I'll be back to bitching in a day or two. makapav The next thing Google needs to enable us family sharing of all pictures and albums instead of doing it one by one. mustbepbs Still can't even add time to an existing fucking timer. Seriously, this company has the weirdest priorities. makapav Stickers FTW! Duder12 Google literally just tackled the biggest hurdle. Its all game over from here on out for the competition. bozzykid Considering you can hardly do anything with the multi-user support, it isn't even clear if it truly works. Martin Still don't get the point of this trash... If it can't make a simple reminder or cal app... What for people use it? Weather? Time? When you are surrounded or 10 more gadgets doing the same (watch, phone, tv, Pc and many more)...

An update released Thursday enables Home's built-in assistant to learn the different voices of up to six people, although they can't all be talking to the internet-connected speaker at the same time. Distinguishing voices will allow Home to be more personal in some of its responses, depending on who triggers the assistant with the phrase, "OK Google" or "Hey Google." For instance, once Home is trained to recognize a user named Joe, the assistant will automatically be able to tell him what traffic is like on his commute, list events on his daily calendar or even play his favorite songs. Then another user named Jane could get similar information from Home, but customized for her. The ability to distinguish voices may help Home siphon sales from Amazon.com's Echo, a competing product that features its own voice-activated assistant, Alexa. The Echo doesn't yet recognize different voices. Instead, it has a feature that allows Alexa to switch to a different account when told to do so. The Echo can only handle two personal accounts. Google's voice-distinction feature, however, won't prevent unauthorized users from activating the assistant, as long as Home's microphone is turned on. That loophole allowed Burger King to recently air a TV commercial that included the phrase "OK Google" to prompt Home's assistant to recite the ingredients of the fast-food restaurant's Whopper burger from a Wikipedia entry. Google quickly blocked Burger King's commercial from toying with the Home assistant, but the marketing stunt illustrated how the technology can be manipulated. Voice-personalization eventually could enable Home's users to block others from accessing the device, but Google isn't ready to do that yet. "It's important to balance making sure the assistant on Google Home is still useful and able to answer a guest's or friend's question while also answering a few specific questions just for you," Google spokeswoman Kara Stockton said. The voice-distinction feature also isn't being offered for the same digital assistant that operates on Google's Pixel phone and other smartphones running on the latest version of its Android software. Google doesn't think the technology is necessary on phones because most of those devices are password-protected and are usually used by just one person. Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.

A Yahoo sign is seen in New York's Times Square in 2008.

And just like that, the once-mighty tech firm is exiting public trading. The company has been unraveling—slowly and spectacularly—for more than a decade now. But this particular moment is a good one for reflecting on how Yahoo’s troubles are likely to be replicated in a wave across the web, and soon, among businesses like news organizations that rely heavily on advertising revenue for their survival.   Print newspapers will continue to fold, but Yahoo’s demise is a signal that web-native companies are next. If you run a business that relies on digital-advertising revenue for an outsized portion of your funding, you need to find new streams of revenue. Now. It may already be too late. Unless you’re Facebook or Google, that is. Facebook and Google are practically drowning in ad revenue—together they command a huge portion of global digital-ad dollars—and that’s the root of the problem for every other business trying to clamor for a piece of it. The precise estimates vary. One often-repeated stat, based on last year’s financials, is that Facebook and Google account for 85-percent of every new dollar spent on digital advertising. But the numbers may be even more stark than that. Jason Kint, the CEO of Digital Content Next, estimates that Facebook and Google accounted for about 99 percent of all advertising growth in the third quarter of 2016—54 percent of the pie for Google, 45 percent of it for Facebook, 1 percent for everybody else. (That’s based on numbers from the each company’s public financial records and data from the Interactive Advertising Bureau, a trade group for advertisers.) For everyone other than Facebook and Google, Kint tweeted in December, it’s a “zero-sum game.” Many investors have reached this conclusion, too. “The ad-tech market will go the way of search, social, and mobile as investors and entrepreneurs concede that Google and Facebook have won and everyone else has lost,” the venture capitalist and blogger Fred Wilson wrote in January. “It will be nearly impossible to raise money for an online advertising business in 2017.” Though Yahoo’s failures were multi-faceted, the company’s fundamental problem was that it could not figure out a way to command a significant enough piece of the advertising money that is increasingly rushing to Facebook and Google. It seems preordained now, having watched Yahoo stumble for so many years, but there was a time when Yahoo was much bigger than either company. It is true that Yahoo was “never able to decide on exactly what it wanted to be,” as Jonathan Weber and Jeffrey Dastin put it for Reuters last year. Perhaps if it had committed to search, for instance, it could have fended off Google. And remember Yahoo’s failed attempt to buy Facebook for $1 billion in 2006? Instead, Verizon’s deal to buy Yahoo is expected to close in June, at which point Yahoo and Verizon-owned AOL will become a new brand called Oath. One particularly telling detail in the recent Associated Press coverage about Yahoo “bowing out as a public company” is the fact that it was at least partly automated—meaning elements of the story were generated by a computer. One way for today’s ad-based companies to survive: replace humans with machines. Way back in 1995, Yahoo seemed destined to establish a successful ad-based business model for the internet era. Back then, the company was still just a directory of sites on the web. And in July of that year, Yahoo announced that “it had signed five initial sponsors as part of a plan to redesign the service and become advertiser-supported,” as The New York Times reported at the time. What that meant was that the logos of the five sponsors would appear, as part of a daily rotation, at the top of Yahoo’s site—primitive banner ads. At the same time, Reuters announced it had signed a deal with Yahoo to feature news on Yahoo’s site in exchange for a piece of the ad revenue coming in. All this seemed to be the first hint at what was to come, an idea of how the web might carry advertising-based businesses like news organizations into the online age. But the picture is much different now. Today, Facebook and Google alone are slurping up the ad dollars, neither company pays for the news it features (despite occasional partnerships with news organizations), and Yahoo as we knew it has all but vanished. It won’t be the only web giant to fall.

Books still in print you’d have to pay for, but everything else—a collection slated to grow larger than the holdings at the Library of Congress, Harvard, the University of Michigan, at any of the great national libraries of Europe—would have been available for free at terminals that were going to be placed in every local library that wanted one. At the terminal you were going to be able to search tens of millions of books and read every page of any book you found.

Let the betting pools begin: What will be the next policy issue that Donald Trump suddenly discovers is way more complicated than “anyone” ever imagined? Already, the aggressively policy-ignorant president has marveled that dealing with touchy issues such as North Korea, China, the Ex-Im bank, Syria, and health care, requires more than trash talk and an itchy Twitter finger. And, while he has yet to break the bad news to the dying coal towns that backed him, Trump has been meeting with energy execs, some of whom have had to gently explain that, when it comes to saving the industry, there’s not all that much he can do. Because—all together now!—it’s complicated. As it turns out, no matter how much reality TV experience one brings to the table, one cannot simply snap one’s fingers and instantly solve the nation’s most vexing problems.

Standard prices and simple discounts are giving way to far more exotic strategies, designed to extract every last dollar from the consumer. As Christmas approached in 2015, the price of pumpkin-pie spice went wild. It didn’t soar, as an economics textbook might suggest. Nor did it crash. It just started vibrating between two quantum states. Amazon’s price for a one-ounce jar was either $4.49 or $8.99, depending on when you looked. Nearly a year later, as Thanksgiving 2016 approached, the price again began whipsawing between two different points, this time $3.36 and $4.69. We live in the age of the variable airfare, the surge-priced ride, the pay-what-you-want Radiohead album, and other novel price developments. But what was this? Some weird computer glitch? More like a deliberate glitch, it seems. “It’s most likely a strategy to get more data and test the right price,” Guru Hariharan explained, after I had sketched the pattern on a whiteboard.

You saw the pictures in science class—a profile view of the human brain, sectioned by function. The piece at the very front, right behind where a forehead would be if the brain were actually in someone’s head, is the pre-frontal cortex. It handles problem-solving, goal-setting, and task execution. And it works with the limbic system, which is connected and sits closer to the center of the brain. The limbic system processes emotions and triggers emotional responses, in part because of its storage of long-term memory. When a person lives in poverty, a growing body of research suggests the limbic system is constantly sending fear and stress messages to the prefrontal cortex, which overloads its ability to solve problems, set goals, and complete tasks in the most efficient ways.

Democrats are facing their first high-profile tests of whether the party can win back seats in Congress in the Trump era. But rather than unifying in opposition to the new administration, the political left is riven by division over what it means to be progressive. The same debates that divided Democrats throughout the 2016 presidential primary—over how and when to prioritize economic populism and reproductive rights—threaten to make it more difficult for Democrats to rally around the very candidates who could help the party make inroads in conservative parts of the country. Controversy over those questions illustrates the challenge Democrats face as they decide which candidates to support, and what transgressions from liberal convictions to let slide, as the party tries to rebuild after being shut out of power in the White House and Congress.

To fuel itself, this gas-guzzling organ requires a constant supply of sugar and oxygen—even when you’re not doing anything. Without the vital gas, ions flood across the barriers of neurons, causing internal havoc, and forcing them to self-destruct. “There’s probably more than a hundred things that will kill brain cells if you turn off the oxygen,” says Thomas Park, from the University of Illinois at Chicago. Within minutes, you’d be dead. And hours after that, a naked mole-rat in the exact same conditions would be happily walking around—the picture of health. Imagine a disembodied index finger that’s been soaking in the bath for too long, and has teeth at the end. That’s a naked mole-rat. These weird rodents live in large underground colonies with nesting chambers the size of footballs. In these cramped subterranean quarters, oxygen levels often fall as low as 6 percent. And yet, these animals cope with this hypoxia. Continue Reading Olena Shmahalo / Quanta Magazine The Universe Is as Spooky as Einstein Thought Natalie Wolchover In a brilliant new experiment, physicists have confirmed one of the most mysterious laws of the cosmos. There might be no getting around what Albert Einstein called “spooky action at a distance.” With an experiment described this week in Physical Review Letters—a feat that involved harnessing starlight to control measurements of particles shot between buildings in Vienna—some of the world’s leading cosmologists and quantum physicists are closing the door on an intriguing alternative to “quantum entanglement.” “Technically, this experiment is truly impressive,” said Nicolas Gisin, a quantum physicist at the University of Geneva who has studied this loophole around entanglement. Continue Reading Oliver Munday Mexico’s Revenge Franklin Foer By antagonizing the U.S.’s neighbor to the south, Donald Trump has made the classic bully’s error: He has underestimated his victim. When Donald Trump first made sport of thumping Mexico—when he accused America’s neighbor of exporting rapists and “bad hombres,” when he deemed the country such a threat that it should be contained by a wall and so clueless that it could be suckered into paying for its own encasement—its president responded with strange equilibrium. Enrique Peña Nieto treated the humiliation like a meteorological disturbance. Relations with the United States would soon return to normal, if only he grinned his way through the painful episode. In August, Peña Nieto invited Trump to Mexico City, based on the then-contrarian notion that Trump might actually become president. Instead of branding Trump a toxic threat to Mexico’s well-being, he lavished the Republican nominee with legitimacy. Peña Nieto paid a severe, perhaps mortal, reputational cost for his magnanimity. Before the meeting, former President Vicente Fox had warned Peña Nieto that if he went soft on Trump, history would remember him as a “traitor.” In the months following the meeting, his approval rating plummeted, falling as low as 12 percent in one poll—which put his popularity on par with Trump’s own popularity among Mexicans. The political lesson was clear enough: No Mexican leader could abide Trump’s imprecations and hope to thrive. Since then, the Mexican political elite has begun to ponder retaliatory measures that would reassert the country’s dignity, and perhaps even cause the Trump administration to reverse its hostile course. With a presidential election in just over a year—and Peña Nieto prevented by term limits from running again—vehement responses to Trump are considered an electoral necessity. Memos outlining policies that could wound the United States have begun flying around Mexico City. These show that Trump has committed the bully’s error of underestimating the target of his gibes. As it turns out, Mexico could hurt the United States very badly. Continue Reading Justin Fantl Frank and Steven’s Excellent Corporate-Raiding Adventure Frank Partnoy and Steven Davidoff Solomon Two law professors tried to mimic big activist hedge funds, investing their retirement savings in a small, languishing public company and trying to shake it up. Here’s what happened. If we had showered or shaved or not been dressed in wrinkled shirts, we would have gotten out of our rented Hyundai to speak with the man in the blue blazer who was walking into the Balboa Bay Resort, a hotel and private club in Newport Beach, California. It was Gregory S. Bielli, the president and CEO of the Tejon Ranch Company. We’d met him once before, when we were in a better frame of mind. Tejon Ranch is a small public company headquartered in Lebec, about an hour north of Los Angeles, and its main asset is obvious from Interstate 5: real estate. The company owns the largest continuous expanse of private land in California, a 270,000-acre parcel—about half the size of Rhode Island—wedged between two national forests, Los Padres and Sequoia.

Some Pixel phones are having problems with backups, Google is looking into it Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/04/20 10:35am PDTApr 20, 2017 22 Plus 1 on G+ 14 Share on Facebook 42 Share on Twitter Total Shares78 Bug Watch Google News Pixel Pixel XL Some users have been experiencing issues with backup on Google's Pixel devices, most notably backups of SMS, call history, and apps, although other accounts of all backup types failing have also been reported.  The current cause isn't known, but reports of the problem on Google's product forums stretch back to just after the launch of the device, and for many the matter remains unresolved. Even one of Google's support specialists discovered he was experiencing the issue, but apart from reaching out to those affected for bug reports no information has been publicly provided. To be clear, for those with the problem their personal data in one or more categories may not be being backed up as they would expect. Not to be alarmist, but with this backup error occurring silently, it might be prudent for Pixel users to check that their devices are, in fact, performing their backups as expected and intended. To check for yourself, navigate to Settings, Backup and Reset, Backup and see if any of the items listed under Content are "Waiting to backup." If you are among those suffering the problem you might want to exercise some caution and consider another backup method for whatever might be failing for you. Also, feel free to add your voices (and log-files) down at Google's product forums. They're currently reaching out to those affected there for additional information, and with more data the issue can probably be fixed that much more quickly.

Gustavo Me too, also only seeing it in Call History on my Pixel teh Jax At least the important ones are working fine! Andrew same here Ryne Hager That's not a huge deal, then. Not the worst thing to lose if your phone eats it. Photos or SMS could be a bigger problem, though. teh Jax Right. If somebody is experiencing this bug with other pieces of data, this is a big deal! If this is all it is, hardly anybody is going to care. And those that do care probably should be using multiple forms of backup anyway. Sachin Bahal Same here Suicide_Note Same. That's the only one that had any issue on my device. steb0ne Same here... So most people in this comment section who actually have Pixel devices seem to be having the same issue with the call history not backing up and a bunch of trolling by other people talking about how it's plagued with bugs, lol! Got it! I wonder how long it's been acting up... Everything else shows backed up this morning. If this is a daily backup and it didn't backup one day is this really that big of a deal? The screenshot posted shows December... I'm curious to know is this a Google feature or Pixel feature? Can someone else with a phone running Nougat confirm if theirs is backing up? teh Jax Definitely a lot of trolling and ignorance going on in these comments. That's pretty typical by people commenting about a premium device that they either can't buy or chose not to buy - it helps them justify their situation. Which is fine by me. It's rare that comments are actually insightful. ¯_(ツ)_/¯ teddyfrozevelt Mine hasn't backed up since I factory reset it in december. Everything else has backed up. Impulse_Vigil It's an Android feature, has been forever, but O and the Pixel are the first places where it's status has been exposed and broken down by category. So it may or may not be working elsewhere, you wouldn't really know. Now freak out! Heh... steb0ne That's what I thought... So it's possibly happening on other non Pixel devices. The article made it seem Pixel specific CJ Me too. Maxr1998 Same for me, Nexus 6P, O Preview. Also had that issue for SMS & apps after I clean-flashed the update, but I could at least fix the latter by manually running "bmgr backupnow --all" in a su shell. SMS somehow resolved itself it seems. Impulse_Vigil Same, everything else is backed up, didn't even know call history could be backed up. 4Ui812 Better call Saul. Bat Man 1 day = 1 problem? 4Ui812 Nausea, heartburn, indigestion, upset stomach, diarrhea.... Google's quality control is hard at work. Middlefinger Yeah, but at least it gets 'Timely updates' /s Phalkon30 Just bought my 6p 2 weeks ago, not a single thing moved to it from my previous device. It's like I never had a Google history, even though I have app backups on my Google Drive. I even tried to to set up from another device, it gave an unknown error and moved nothing I'm going to have to root to fix it, awful backup solution sproc I think it only works with the same phone honestly, cause otherwise I bet no one uses it sadly. Tiuri Elvander Sent in my 6p for an RMA, it was fully backed up. Tried to restore the backup on my replacement 6p but it only offered my One plus One (which I used while I was waiting for my replacement). The whole thing lasted less than a week, yet my original backup was not available as an option to restore. Very annoying!! Jordan VanCampen Same here. My work phone which is a Moto z play stopped working. I got a replacement and thought that I'd be able restore it from the previous one, but nope. The setup process only gave me the option to restore from my Vizio tablet that came with my TV that I recently bought. My pixel that is my personal phone wasn't an option. So I decided that I would use the NFC option. So I I did that with my pixel and it didn't restore anything at all. The backup situation on Android is still pretty much a dumpster fire. Ryne Hager I've had the restore from previous device thing bug out as well, I usually just set everything up as a new device now. blindexecutioner $800 device running never-ending beta software. Jingwei Zhang It does backup a lot of settings for many apps. As for games, if the game requires logging in, it backs up the log in information if you had it set as memorized. It also memorizes the layout of the apps. The backup is definitely not the best, but it's automatic and much more comprehensive than the native backup other manufacturers provide, including ios. Roy Hm, no. I used an iphone and ipod touch ages ago and they actually have a backup solution that works. When you restore, it's like you never left - even between devices. Even Blackberry had a better backup system than Android ever has - the only decent backup solution Android has is Titanium backup (which is, to be fair, excellent), and that requires root so most people are SOL. I've never even had my wifi settings restored properly, even though that's supposedly backed up. Jingwei Zhang Hm, no. We have six iPhones in the family and none of them backup like you said here (like you never left). However, my Nexus to Pixel transfer was like that. All apps, photos, sms and etc were restored to the same position and most pertinent settings were restored. IIRC, the phone even restored my company's WIFI setting with the correct credential. I don't know which android phone you have, but Google's backup does some pretty amazing things for requiring absolutely no maintenance on the user's side. EDIT: I just remembered. My sister and mom actually use Google Photo on their iPhone 6S/7 because it's free and easy as opposed to the tiny iCloud storage. JohnyNoLegs Its free when it compresses your photos. Also iPhone does whole phone backup, android does not. Also if you lose your pixel right now, you are screwed, as you can't do a transfer. Jingwei Zhang IIRC Pixel has full photo backup without any compression. I believe I specifically said that it does some amazing things with absolutely no user side maintenance. You can always do a manual full backup with titanium or in recovery. Root and unlocked bootloader are needed, but that's just takes a few minutes with Nexus and Pixel. How is that? Everything is automatically backed up including video, pic and sms, call history and etc on a daily basis. I would wager that you can retrieve more current information from a lost Pixel/Nexus than from a lost iPhone if they were both lost and went completely off the grid. JohnyNoLegs Wager away, then send me the money. iPhone does a bit for bit backup, it backs up the current state of the whole iPhone. Google does not do this. Google selectively backs up items like call history, sms etc. Pixel is the only Android phone that offers uncompressed backup for free, not really an option for everyone mate. Titanium backup is for ROOT LOLOLOLOL. Recovery is for unlocked devices LOLOLOLOLOL iPhone does complete backup with any hacking required, talk about no user side maintenance! BTW, my Pixel stopped backup up photos, it's a bug. Doesn't sound like no user maintenance required haha Jingwei Zhang hmm comparing full backup that can take upwards of an hour to one that runs in the background huh? You definitely understand what no user maintenance is and are certainly brilliant. Comparing apple to orange as long as it suits your narrative. Are we talking about any other android phone? I don't think so. Unlocking bootloader and granting root access are considered hacking now? Bugs and failures happen, just like how two of our iPhone 6 bricked just out of warranty. Also, my Pixel is not experiencing this bug, so it's not a problem for me (yet). JohnyNoLegs Think logically for a second mate. You are talking a out no user maintenance. IPhone does full backups while you sleep. Android does not. To root your phone and unlock the bootloader requires user maintenance. Impulse_Vigil I do think iOS backup functionality is more comprehensive, it doesn't leave things up to individual devs either... OTOH it does gobble up a pretty decent amount of storage on accounts where people often end up having to pay extra for... Nothing is perfect. JohnyNoLegs It's true, but for the person who just wants their stuff backed up, IOS has it covered much better than android. Even the simplicity of setting up iCloud to do everything is great. In Android it is a bit all over the shop in deep settings and different apps. I'm fine with Androids implementation, but then again I don't care about doing factory resets etc which is kinda the nature of android. iPhone users perhaps are less used to having to restore their data all the time. Ryne Hager I think it backs up some appdata, like Netflix login information carrying over to new devices, that sort of thing. JohnyNoLegs After an RMA and a few factory resets, I can tell you it hasn't in my case. Impulse_Vigil It can do that, but apps need to be written for it, backup has always been a joke on Android but it's largely because devs ignore the existing tools tbh. Killa I'm not seeing any option on my Nexus 6 in the Backup & Reset area that shows the breakout of the different backup content like it does in the image above. There's just the On/Off switch and language that says backups are in Google Drive...etc. Is this only a Pixel thing or higher version of Android? Phalkon30 Must be a pixel thing, I don't see it on my 6P either, and I'm on 7.1.2 Cyan Thayn It's also an O thing apparently, have the exact menu shown in the screenshots on my 6P on the O preview (and have the same bugs as well!). Ryne Hager It's a pixel thing, no need to worry. Impulse_Vigil I'm not even sure what the point is, I guess extra info and transparency (which is good), because none of those options really do anything but tell you what's being backed up. There's nothing to toggle besides the main backup option and the option to backup to Drive. Shoot, other phones could be suffering the same issues but because the backup status isn't displayed nobody would know! On my Pixel everything but call history is up to date, and I couldn't care less about that. Ishimaru Another day, another Pixel issue. Ramon Google is fucking up a lot lately. What's taking so long to fire some people? Just not just lately Conrad Okay, so what happened to the review of the Synology 416play? I'd really like to read it! lomsha Some premium device lol. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Once again, I told you so. You should really run a daily series called "Google Screwup Of The Day". Ryne Hager Your name is amazing. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Not many people get it. ;) J.J. Pixel and problem are two words heard often lately! Leif Sikorski Same with previous Nexus and some other Google Hardware devices. It's one reason why I'm glad that other OEMs update slower these days. Google keeps giving me the impression that they still see their devices as geeky developer devices where the user does the final testing. If they want to be more serious with their hardware efforts and compete with the big brands they need to invest much more money into testing and customer support. Ryne Hager Eh, bugs happen with any tech, and the volume of problems has gotten a lot smaller than things used to be back in the day. Progress has its pitfalls, is all. Nick I'm with you here. I get that people expect nothing but excellence from a device that they paid a pretty penny for, but stuff happens sometimes and so far it hasn't been anything that warrants the level of indignation I am seeing here in the comment section. I'm sure Google will fix the issue as soon as they possibly can. JohnyNoLegs And by progress, you mean they haven't really done anything different right? Still the same updates with bugs, still take ages to fix anything. I am still having the worst bluetooth experience of any phone I have owned, and that's after an RMA already! Anon Now we know why the pixel includes 24/7 support. Lisarbeams Managing director of Google!, is explaining to users to start off "Work at home" method, that People have been doing for about one year now.

Let's see what the bug list for the S8 looks like six months down the line! Phil We're already on a pink screen and what's it been? 2 weeks? I've not heard any reports of exploding Pixels so far at least. Most of the people trolling these articles are Sammy Knights who should know better. I'm looking forward to seeing what problems the S8 has over the next 6 months. By the way, is Bixby's working yet? Mike Bastable The Pixel handsets seen to be agreeing poorly... Lot of bugs recently... Sachin Bahal no device will ever be perfect, there will always be some issue(s) during a device's life cycle, and it just so happens that the Pixel's issues/bugs are happening 6 months into the phone's life cycle Ryne Hager Yeah, I expect they'll probably get things fixed. Bugs happen. Sachin Bahal The Pixel is just crawling with bugs ;) Hussain Ahmadi And some go on to call this crap as best Android phone? A big joke and Google has made a really big joke of itself by releasing this iAndroid phone!! Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ The Pixel is STILL listed as the Best Android Phone on most sites, despite all the problems, the halos in the pictures, etc. Even though I NEVER thought it deserved that status, I can understand that most of its problems surfaced after web magazines rated it. But it's clear now that the phone sucks and its software sucks. If publishing had any integrity, they'd issue a correction, revoke that title and make some other phone the best phone of 2016. Impulse_Vigil Or most of the problems aren't really as wide spread as some seem to believe, I've had pretty much no issues with mine. Marty I had a Google backup issue on my OP3T. I factory wiped it after an update and the restore function usually seen during set up didn't appear. YaKillaCJ Something about that picture just bugs me... Impulse_Vigil I see what you did there! Have a ^ Arcest Not new adb restore failed to re-install apk https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/37130390 Sir_Brizz Compromise free device. Actually getting tired of making this joke, which says something. Impulse_Vigil Compromise and bug free since Nov here. /shrug New_Guy Geez, they Pixel has so many issues, it's crazy... Phil This problem is only being reported by people enrolled on the beta testing of Android O ffs. Of course there are going to be bugs with am OS still in the testing stage. That's the whole point isn't it? Give people an early look in order that they can identify bugs and instabilities? The problem is not the phone, it a Dev version of an OS. Kevin Sword Loving your hero images Ryne! Mr.Bean ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ We're gonna need a can of Raid to squash these bugs. Muzaffar Don't mind the bugs, as long as it get stock android and latest update. ashjas Are these options only pixel specific..? I mean I don't see such backup options on my Nexus 4 with nougut custom rom? Impulse_Vigil Call history is waiting to be backed up here weird, everything else is current. I didn't even know my phone backed up call history tbh... Seems I've gotten ultra lucky with Pixel bugs, outside a handful of sporadic instances of Bluetooth turning off thru the start of the year I've avoided just about everything else. Got mine in November FWIW, tap on wood. Bala Same here since day one for SMS and call history ,it's funny when they say they are looking into. A feature that's supposed to work with final release is not working for a while and still they are looking Jan Machovec Is this something Pixel specific? Because I don't see any option to backup SMS, Call log and others on my SGS7.

Google Confirms That The Play Store And Over A Million Android Apps Are Coming To Chrome OS Later This Year Bertel King, Jr. Follow View All Posts 2016/05/19 12:04pm PDTMay 19, 2016 160 Plus 1 on G+ 144 Share on Facebook 0 Share on Twitter Total Shares304 Applications News The day has come. Okay, not quite. But you've waited a long time for Android apps to come to Chrome OS. You've left comments. You've replied to comments. You even left more comments. Now your work is being rewarded. As we've all recently heard, Google plans to bring the Play Store to Chromebooks. At Google I/O today, the company has made things official. Like everything in Chrome, the feature will first arrive in the developer channel. Certain touch-enabled Chromebooks should receive the capability in the M53 Dev version starting in early June. The stable channel can expect the goods to arrive in September or October. Google wants this to be an experience that "just works," for developers and users alike. Apps will appear in three different window sizes, so don't try to resize. You can multi-task and move windows around. Apps should register keyboard, mouse, and touch inputs together. Integration also extends to notifications, sharing files, and detecting both Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. According to Ars Technica, this functionality isn't using the App Runtime for Chrome (ARC), which Google started experimenting with two years ago. ARC ran on top of Chrome's native client architecture. Ultimately app developers still had to do too much work, from Google's perspective, to make this situation viable. Instead, an unmodified version of the Android Framework will run in a container. Apps will be able to access connectivity, storage, sound, and other aspects of the broader OS. Google updates the Chrome OS Android app framework directly, and the Chrome team has committed to keeping up with Android's monthly security updates. As big as this news may be, not everyone wants Android apps. Many buyers, such as schools, value Chromebooks because of their simplicity and their ability to be easily locked down. For this reason, Google is providing the ability to whitelist apps or block Play Store access entirely. The Asus Chromebook Flip, 2015 Pixel, and Acer Chromebook R11 will be the first devices to receive support in June.

So it will be on my (now even more lovely) Pixel in the end of June (dev channel) according to this release schedule: https://www.chromium.org/developers/calendar Article states beginning of June, so lets hope I'm wrong. Lets say two weeks away. I COULD LIVE WITH THAT. Faheem Ahmed wish i had a chrome :( and7eh Here you have!: http://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop Artem Russakovskii The direct quote from the official blog post: "We are making the feature available in early June on Asus Chromebook Flip, Chromebook Pixel (2015) and Acer Chromebook R11 specifically for developers to have sufficient time to test their apps. For the actual launch and thereafter we will keep adding support for the following list of devices. Please see detailed instructions on how to get started with testing your apps." keithzg I will now insert my lament, on behalf of all residents of Canada, that Google weirdly refuses to sell the Chromebook Pixel to us. (That being said, I have a first-gen Pixel I bought off ebay and while my few gripes with it have been solved in the current-gen model, I love it as a laptop nonetheless, and it works great for dual-booting ChromeOS dev and Kubuntu 16.04.) Tomasz Kucza You could probably buy it from eBay. This is how I got my Pixel C (which I think could use a ChromeOS now...). OligarchyAmbulance At this point, why have ChromeOS on the Pixel C? You would be getting a less-than-touch-optimized version of Chrome, and the exact same Android apps. What would be the purpose? Tomasz Kucza For occasion mouse and keyboard use full Chrome browser would be excellent. Mobile Chrome is pathetic in comparison. Also easier multitasking (apps in windows) which might take a while to be available in Android. OligarchyAmbulance After having a Surface with a 10" screen, I think it's too small of a screen to have windowed apps like that. I think the current solution is better for this size. TedPhillips extensions, perhaps? (which are only in desktop chrome, still) keithzg Luckily they do sell the Pixel C here in Canada via the Google Store, so I was able to just normally purchase one directly. Yeah, I've considered going for an eBay one, but I'd personally want the top-end one, and for that much over a thousand dollars I'd rather have a warranty---otherwise it's kindof hard to justify that sort of investment. And I *do* have my first-gen Chromebook Pixel I bought on eBay, after all. Taco Monster As far as I can tell, the 'branch point' appears to be about 2 weeks behind the actual release date of the corresponding dev build. For instance, it lists 52's branch point as today, but the dev channel was updated to 52 on May 4. So judging by that, 53 dev should be released around June 15. Greyhame YES! Mark Bennett Does anyone know if this will eventually make it's way to Chrome on Mac/Win/Linux? It would be great to be able to run Android apps from Chrome. Faheem Ahmed ask google :( Jens Knutson This really makes me sad, but no, I don't think this will come to Mac or Windows. They're relying on Linux-specific container technology to make this work. :-/ I really hope I'm wrong. It'd be amazing to have a cross-platform, truly great native app framework. Jon Ross I would guess the Linux version of Chrome won't receive it either. keithzg You're probably right, although it'll be interesting to see how open Google's portion of the codebase is for this and if it's then possible to get it running on Linux anyways. -Matoro Zeliph- Google seems to not focusing on the desktop environment recent. We still don't have the Google Drive sync application available for is Linux users. Lars Jeppesen Semi native containers are coming to OSX and Windows. I'm beta testing for Docker, and while performance isn't there yet, it's very promising. Windows uses the HyperV engine, and I'm not sure what the container engine for OSX is called. Jens Knutson Containers technologies aren't interchangeable. That's sort of like saying that you should be able to use Chrome plugins on Firefox because Firefox also has plug-ins. Joop Kiefte which will be possible soon enough by the way... TedPhillips nope. you lost that when they pivoted away from ARC ikjadoon No. For a stopgap, you can dual-boot Chrome OS (Neverware has an excellently maintained Chrome OS build with wide compatibility). Faheem Ahmed boooo! @google its not coming to pc :( sooooooooooooooo much sad keithzg Chromebooks are PCs, just not *Windows* PCs. You Windows users have misused the term for too long; all hail our new Linux-based overlords! ;) mark Although I'd add it's Apple and its users who most propagate this misinformation, by claiming that Macs aren't PCs. And to be fair, I think a lot of Windows users would include Linux machines as PCs, it's just with Windows's massive share a PC is usually synonymous with one running Windows anyway. It's usually software companies at fault when they say "For PC and Mac". Apple propagate the myth because they want their one make of laptop to be seen as a 50/50 choice. Microsoft are happy to go along with it, because they want Windows to be seen as the only choice for any computer that isn't Apple. Oddly Apple were happy to claim Macs were PCs before they switched to x86, so they could falsely make claims like first 64-bit PC or fastest PCs... seems that Apple fans have already forgotten all about that. keithzg Yup, it's all a combination of marketing and short memories. Corey Watford And just like that Remix OS is DOA Robert Firestone Thanks Jide for the last year. Goodbye TheSpaceUnicorn Until Google makes it possible to install an official chrome OS build on any PC, Remix isn't going anywhere, for me. OhYeah! Remix will still be a sad cousin of Cloud Ready PC if they add in the android support. Or cloudready should combine with remix os and make this possible NOW. ikjadoon It's essentially possible with Neverware's CloudReady Chrome OS build. Or, do you actually want the Android framework available to tinker with? Tomasz Kucza I think we need to wait a bit for Android to get multi-window support for that. But it might be around the same time - because it looks like they delayed it for developers to have time to add support for it. Diego Opazo SV-Cross I'll have to buy a Chromebook now! Thanks Google! blackice85 This actually makes me consider getting a Chromebook now, as I was torn between a tablet or a small netbook of some sort. Better still if I can find one that's got a touch screen. mark If only there were devices that put those 2 into 1... blackice85 There are actually, and they might become the standard once this feature rolls out. TheSpaceUnicorn The problem with 2 in 1s is that they make worse tablets than dedicated tablets and worse laptops than dedicated laptops. It's all about deciding what's good enough for you. blackice85 Yeah I realize that they're probably a compromise between the two, but with this addition it gives me a lot more choices at least. mark I disagree they're worse tablets (although it limits one's choice to the larger sizes). Whilst there are some compromises to a pure laptop, for someone who wants both (like the OP), the benefits outweigh those (especially compared to having to lug a laptop and tablet around with you). Plus those compromises tend to be things like not being possible to make it as thin or as light as a pure laptop, but you only tend to get those advantages with high end laptops anyway, not in the Chromebook price range. I agree it's all about deciding what's good enough for you, which is why it's good there are 2 in 1s who want both, where a pure laptop or pure tablet isn't good enough. I'm not saying it's the best thing or for everyone, but just noting it's an option that exists for someone who is having trouble deciding. Kawshik Ahmed We need iso of Chrome OS now. Please!! Google make Chrome OS available for Standard PC and Laptops. mark It is - or rather, in the form of Chromium OS. Will Google Play be limited only to Chromebooks? That would be a shame if so. Kawshik Ahmed Google is saying the Android implementation part is currently Closed Sourced if so Chromium OS will not get it at launch. MJ You will need more than just a iso of Chrome OS. Drivers? ikjadoon They can be integrated into the Chrome OS build. That's how Neverware does it: http://www.neverware.com/blogcontent/2016/5/2/cloudready-update-v481-for-free-users ikjadoon Already exists: http://www.neverware.com/#freeintro Extremely well-maintained (has a dedicated subreddit, too) and pretty wide compatibility. Kawshik Ahmed Neverware's Cloudready OS uses Chromium OS for their build and Google said the current Android Container Code will stay closed source for now so Chromium OS will not get it at launch or maybe anytime soon. So Neverware will also not get it at launch. ikjadoon Oh, wow, great point! I forgot they said it was going to be closed-source. But I also heard the Chrome OS team said it was faster development and unsure quality--not a philosophical or legal reason. Maybe, then, after it goes through the developer builds, they'll re-integrate into the main Chromium OS branch? I hope? Kawshik Ahmed Yes. I also think it will eventually come to Chromium OS but even if Android Container come to Chromium it won't have Play Services pre installed. ikjadoon Hmm, true. NeverWare does some interesting tweaking; somehow they even got Netflix working properly on Chromebooks. Richard Branches Now I have a good reason to buy a chromebook computer... adam seymour about time too Dave Microsoft Office apps on Chromebooks! Yay! Greg Macek This is what I was waiting for! The Android apps are actually pretty decent and more pleasing to use than the Office Online editions. And from the sounds of it, they'll be able to access local files which would be amazing. Dave Haven't played with these apps yet. But I tried the online versions of Word and Powerpoint and they don't work very well on my Acer C720. Veeery sluggish and having to use OneDrive sucks. Sadly the Acer C720 won't be getting the Play Store :( Greg Macek I agree the online versions work in a pinch. You can also use a Dropbox account with Office Online, which does a better job of syncing with more platforms. Dave As long as I can't use Google Drive it doesn't matter which cloud service I have to choose, neither will be used :P I've got my stuff there and won't start using something else just for that anyway not properly working option. David Prieto "You've left comments. You've replied to comments. You even left more comments. Now your work is being rewarded." It's lines like this that keep me coming to AP day after day after day. Scott Breitbach ...after day after day after day... Philip Worthington Ha! I win - I've never commented on Chrome running Android apps! And I never will! Oh, wait. Bas Keetelaar No C720 support :( Bravedadoftwins I know. I love my c720! It has to be one of the most purchased chromebook ever. Hayes Cooper Exactly. And the fact that they're taking a chromebook that's not even 3 years old - perhaps *the* best selling chromebook of all-time - and throwing it into forced obsolescence makes me hesitant about buying a new one. Chromebooks aren't smartphones. TigerMike901 I bought the ASUS CB Flip on the recommendation from Cameron here earlier in the year and man it has been a terrific device! Got a great deal on it from Amazon too! And now, it's on the short list for upcoming Android apps!! So stoked!!! senor_heisenberg Now I really want a Chromebook. blindexecutioner You want to run Android apps on your Chromebook that are, and will most likely continue to be, designed for phones? Developers didn't even design apps for tablets when tablets were the hot new thing. Why would they design them for Chromebooks? TheSpaceUnicorn Yes, because a lot of android apps are still better than their corresponding websites. _jsw_ For many apps, it doesn't much matter if they design them for Chromebooks as long as they can be *used* on Chromebooks. Password apps, etc, are all nice, little, widget-like things that would be useful to have on the Chromebook but which don't need to be full-screen or fully "laptop-enabled". senor_heisenberg Yes. mark Phones are tablets, with the addition of legacy cell phone functionality. Unless you meant to say larger sizes, but there are a continuum of sizes, not just two. Where it lacks is that there would still be the app gap - both in terms of raw numbers (Windows has millions of apps) and the kinds of applications people often run on PCs (from powerful productivity software, to high end games). Still, it puts ChromeOS in a better position than currently. ikjadoon Just dual-boot it, yo. http://www.neverware.com/#freeintro Gerardo Sarabia This makes the Google Play store something somehow bigger than Android. The Google Play store is what connects Android and Chrome at least for now. I think is pretty clever although a little bit confusing for the user. Are we gonna see the Adobe CC suite for Android? or is it gonna be for Chrome OS?. Google has to decide, probably they did and it looks like they picked Android, it wouldn't make sense for them to push two different projects of that scale while keeping them compatible. It would be a lot of waste of resources, time and energy. Sir_Brizz They don't have to be "compatible" in this sense because the actual Android Framework is running in a container on ChromeOS. They can be modified independently as long as ChromeOS keeps support for containerization (which they will because that's what Google uses as the host image for their own container platform) Gerardo Sarabia They still would need to do some maintenance, updates, etc. My point is, extra work is going to be necessary, and of course resources, in order to keep this working. It is still really clever, this is a pretty Googly move, big and bold. It is a moonshot. Sir_Brizz But in this case that's just maintaining the container image, which is (probably) a lot less work than having a subsystem in ChromeOS that does the same thing (which is what ARC was). redragn5 Here's hoping I don't have to wait too long on my Yoga 11e chromebook Derek Dean The real question though is: Can I run Chrome for Android on Android for Chrome? Greg Miernicki LOL! Should be possible! Then after progressing beyond this L1 difficulty task, you can try to Chrome Remote Desktop (Android) into your Chromebook for infinite recursion! VAVAMk_2 Divide by zero Twelk No support for the HP Chromebox or my trusty old Samsung Series 3? Might be time for a new Chrome device. YisSerL No love for the original chromebook pixel? :( Franklin Yeah I second this. I guess I might get a flip. Joop Kiefte I have both, love them both. The flip is one of the nicest small devices I have ever had! Roberto Virga The question I get asked again and again when I recommend Chromebooks to family and friends is "Yeah, but does it run Skype?". I don't know which will come first, the plugin-free Skype web app (which I hear is currently in beta), or Android for Chrome OS Stable, but either way by the end of this year I will be finally able to recommend a Chromebook to anyone who is looking to buy a new PC! Bootleg Zani Damn man they should include the Acer Chromebook 14. MJ This seems backwards... Android N is getting multi-window and floating windows support so why not just make android laptops? Anyway, this will be more interesting if/when someone can/does get this to run on Linux. person Because ChromeOS already exists, has an established user base under that use case and, unlike Android, is fully controlled by Google. A Person Time to start looking for a touchscreen Chromebook. ikjadoon Or, run CloudReady Chrome OS as a dual-boot on a Windows system. I'm so hyped to try this out on my new Dell $250 Win10 convertible. I was waiting for a solid convertible Chromebook, but they were all too small. 11" max? :( _jsw_ And... look for the next generation of Chromebooks to be touchscreen more often than now and have larger built-in storage. marcusmarcus2 "Certain touch-enabled Chromebooks should receive the capability in the M53 Dev version starting in early June" Do you think they will eventually have the capabilities on non-touch-enabled Chromebooks at some point in time? Greg Miernicki ChromeOS : The Perfect Reference Implementation of Stock Android ™ (without fragmentation) Dmitry Stepanushkin ItsHappening.gif Fatal1ty_93_RUS This actually makes me wish Chromebooks had 32GB or bigger by default, since most cheaper versions come with 16GB. Imagine if you run something like Crouton or Chrx on it - most of the time you devote at least half of your storage capacity to Linux, which leaves you at a rather small amount of free space, unless you upgrade your SSD, if it's even possible José Gómez So happy to read that the Toshiba Chromebook 2 will support Android apps. It's already been one of the best purchased I ever made, made even better by this announcement! JG Will this include all Android apps? I know there was an issue using ARC when it came to using apps that needed to sign in through your Google account... T’ This will make Chromebooks the most up-to-date Android devices out there. Funny thought. strauzo And apps in google play that need root ? Nachopinion So if you could potentially do the external GPU with a dock like Razors and Vulkyn was adopted on a grander scale, could you potentially replace Microsoft all together on the gaming platform with Chrome OS? JG Any hints if the Chrome apps will be limited to just those who reside within the Play Store, or will we be able to side-load apps ? Just Me Not bad at all 👍 Kevin H This is going to be awesome! I switched to the Dev channel before I heard of this and now I'm waiting to play with it! I don't have a touch screen so in still waiting, but it should be here soon! play store download This is a huge number. I'm wondering if the Play store is bigger than the App store?

The Play Store Is Coming To Chrome OS, Complete With All The Android Apps You Could Ever Want Phil Oakley Follow View All Posts 2016/04/25 7:12am PDTApr 25, 2016 157 Plus 1 on G+ 581 Share on Facebook 0 Share on Twitter Total Shares738 Google News In 2014, Google brought a few Android apps to Chrome OS - at first it was a trickle, and then more and more came, until an astounding 29 apps were available. Google then released ARC Welder, a tool that allowed developers to port their apps without Google's involvement. But Android apps on Chrome OS have always felt like they didn't really belong on Chrome. Now, Google might be about to change that. According to reddit user /u/TheWiseYoda, there is a setting in Chrome OS v51 (which is currently available through the developer channel) which says "Enable Android Apps to run on your Chromebook." In and of itself, that's not really saying anything - Android apps have been on Chrome OS for a while. This option quickly disappeared, meaning /u/TheWiseYoda could not tick it to see what happened. Above: the Google Play store window on Chrome OS, with the settings showing the enabled checkbox in the background However, others had better luck and were able to enable the setting. They found that it brings up a window with "Google Play store now on your Chromebook." It also says users can choose from "over a million apps to install and use on your Chromebook." Like the earlier checkbox, this window automatically closes pretty quickly, but the information is there for all to see. Pretty cool, huh? Could this be the big Google I/O news this year? We'll have to wait and see, but it certainly looks promising.

Adrian Mazur I thought they already did that. I guess it's better late than never, huh? Brad ARC Welder existed but you could "install" one app at a time. Plus no play services. Taedirk Chromebook might actually be worth something now. Brad As long as your hard drive is big enough! codemonkey85 I wonder if you'll be able to install on external storage? Don't most Chromebooks have SD slots too? wlkn That would be great if chrome os adopted SD card storage as internal storage like android codemonkey85 Why would that matter? wlkn Because the overflow apps would be put on the SD card automatically without you having to think about it Fatal1ty_93_RUS Might be an issue for folks with 16GB drives (given they can't be upgraded). 32GB, however, should cover more than enough since you won't be storing too much media on a Chromebook anyway (so immediately cut out music, videos, photos, and movies) Carl Draper I've been using a Chromebook as my primary laptop for over a year, so i have no idea what you are talking about Android Developer Is it possible to install Android-Studio on it? Scott Wilson Yes. Once you are in developer mode. Use Crouton. Android Developer I don't have it, but how does it work? As Linux installation? Scott Wilson Google it. It shares the kernel side-by-side. Used it for two huge projects. Works wonderfully. Android Developer Nice. Interesting to know. Kenny Strawn Linux installation in a chroot jail with Chrome OS as the host (non-chrooted) OS. See github.com/dnschneid/crouton for details. Android Developer Thank you ! Brad Haha, I just bought an ultrathin notebook with windows because I needed to record via usb on the go and all the chrome os apps needed network connections... I really wanted that physical size of laptop, but I'm sure there's a fitting android app to do what I want... damn timing. chromaniac You can use Google Drive (docs/slides/sheets) without internet connection. Documents are created and saved offline and synced when internet connectivity is there. This is how it works on Windows and this is how it works on Chrome OS. Not much difference in how properly created web apps with offline support work on either of the platforms. Brad The thing is - recording apps in chrome don't have offline support. Trust me, I looked into solutions that would work for me. I was even tempted into trying to load linux on the thing until I read how poorly it'd run on my machine. chromaniac personally i doubt that support for android apps would somehow fix all the shortcomings on the chrome os platform (as you said... there are a lot even for basic tasks) but hopefully, we would stop seeing comments stating that chromebook is nothing but a computer with a web browser :) Richard Branches I guess google felt threatened by remix os and the other similar os.. Snuffles tasker on my laptop? Perry Mason Pic + post = win pezboy This. The potential... https://media.giphy.com/media/FrajBDPikVqBG/giphy-facebook_s.jpg Dean I'm down for it anyday wlkn The only Android app that I really want is es file Explorer so I can access my network drive through lan. It's stupid that I can do that with my phone but not my chromebook. codemonkey85 You mean like... this? https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/file-system-for-windows/mfhnnfciefdpolbelmfkpmhhmlkehbdf Elphonse Elric For whatever reason I've found that to be a bit fiddly. wlkn Yeah I've messed with that one before without much luck. Probably just me though. Gregory That's kinda disappointing... Weren't they going to merge Android and Chrome OS? Phil Oakley No. They said that was never the plan. They've been making Chrome and Android more and more cohesive for a while, but they achieve very different purposes so they won't merge them. JL I prefer the microsoft idea of continuum. Only one OS that adapts to all displays. It would be interesting to see Android+Chrome OS doing this. waloody88 but I read somewhere that they are working on merging Android with chrome OS and that it will be released next year and an early preview will be available end of this year. Matt Yes and no. They want to make ChromeOS more touch friendly and the only way to do that is to incorporate elements from Android into ChromeOS so that it can be more touch friendly. ChromeOS and Android are still going to be two separate operating systems. person That was a rumor. They quickly debunked it. Phil Oakley The rumours were wrong. They are not merging, but simply gaining features the other platform has. At least that's how I understand it. The way Google works is having two products compete against each other. That way, the products improve because of competition. Badouken Lol I just asked for this yesterday and now it's a thing. I'm so damn happy. senor_heisenberg Ask for more awesome things! My Dixie Wrecked Could it have hurt to ask for world peace?! Badouken Lol I wasted my only wish! codemonkey85 Oh man. If desktop Chrome for Windows / Mac / Linux is supported as well as Chrome OS, that is going to be HUGE. Even if not, it's still a boon for Chromebooks. Phil Oakley I'm on the hunt for a new laptop. I don't like Windows (and that's not me being all anti-Microsoft, I genuinely don't find I get much work done on the platform), so it's between Android, Chrome OS or OS X / macOS. If we get either a 12.85-inch Pixel C, running a desktop version of Android, or a revitalised Chrome OS, at I/O, I'd be very interested. I'm also interested to see what Apple do to OS X at WWDC (I currently use an ancient 2010 MacBook Air). If they announce a new *kit (UIKit?) for OS X, bringing iPhone apps to Macs, I'd also be interested. We will see. codemonkey85 I'd say Android apps running on Chrome OS will probably make a better laptop experience than an Android OS laptop, just based on how things work today, but I guess we'll see. As far as UIKit for OS X goes... I've heard Apple used something kinda like that to build their OS X version of Photos, so I wouldn't be terribly surprised if we get that this year or next. wlkn Yeah android on a laptop doesn't work yet because you can only use the mobile version of Google docs. I was excited to try remix OS until oh yeah doesn't have a desktop browser and so no desktop Google docs mark I'm waiting to see if they'll do U-turn and admit MS were right all along (as with styluses), or whether they're seriously expecting people to run apps designed for a 4" phone an a laptop that doesn't even have a touchscreen. codemonkey85 Well unlike on iOS for example, there's already support for a keyboard and mouse. They would just have to improve it to work better in a desktop environment. MechDome We are bringing Android apps to iOS and Mac OS X. No virtualization involved, apps run natively. Check out demos at http://www.mechdome.com codemonkey85 Sure, but what about my paid Play Store apps? Those are the ones I most want to run. MechDome This is a tool for app developers to port Android apps to iOS. Once the app is converted the developer may choose to publish it to App Store. Jura This is cool, but what about vise versa? Is there a system to get iOS apps onto Android? (the latter seems like a better idea - a lot of apps come to iOS first or don't come to Android at all.) wlkn I can't think of any apps beside a file Explorer with network lan Drive access I would want. I guess maybe if I had a touchscreen I might prefer an app over the web page. What apps do you guys want on your chromebook? Elphonse Elric Games with controller support would be my first thought. jonathan3579 That's pretty much what I mainly use my Pixel C for! That, and YouTube.. wlkn True didn't think about games ChicagoPete The grocery list app that my family uses that doesn't have a web interface would be one. Also - I'm a DoggCatcher guy but I've tried all the other big podcatcher apps - Pocket Casts' web interface really wouldn't be needed anymore, would it? codemonkey85 Yeah, Pocket Casts is a great example - being able to download podcasts and access your filters / playlists would be amazing. Mark Kalinsky #1 app installed first René Simonsen Tasker? Daniel Harris Using a mouse or touchpad for Android apps is really tedious. Badouken Alot of Chromebooks have touchscreens. pfmiller Yes, but using a touchsceen on a laptop isn't exactly a joy either. I never touch the screen on my laptop even though it's supported. atlouiedog How many of the applications that you use on your laptop are built around touch though? Maybe you'd touch the screen more if you had a reason to. pfmiller I have reason to for some apps, it's not the apps design that's the problem it's my arm's. It's just not comfortable holding it out to my screen for any amount of time. The ergonomics of using a tablet versus a laptop are just very different. mark Why either/or? On my Windows Transformer Book I find I use touchpad, keyboard and touchscreen all seamlessly together. Applications need good support for all three. codemonkey85 Hopefully there will be some way for devs to make that better too, to go hand-in-hand with this. (iOS just started improving keyboard support too, for that matter.) Phil Oakley I wouldn't be surprised if we get desktop improvements for Android at I/O. Red5 I think that has pretty much been confirmed with the split window addition that the N preview gave us. We might not get all the needed/wanted desktop improvements, but I think Google will give us some of the big ones. My guess is that they will announce an I/O and then another N preview update will be available right after that with more desktop/networking goodies added in for testing. Brian Demodulated Man do I wish we could run Android apps on Windows 10 in a nicer way than a virtual machine. codemonkey85 Hopefully Play Store support comes to Windows Chrome too! (Although the fact that they're killing the app launcher kind of sobers those expectations.) Brian Demodulated That would be an ideal solution for me. With any luck this ChromeOS update is the first step toward this. René Simonsen I'm not saying I think Android apps are coming to Chrome for Windows. But I just wanted to say that I don't think the death of app launcher says anything about it.. If they were to roll out such a big feature, it would likely be with a whole new launcher. codemonkey85 Well, you might be right. And I guess you *can* still access your apps from chrome://apps. Either way we'll see soon enough. Adam But that interface is absolutely terrible looking. I use the Taskbar icon all the time, and folders are an absolute necessity. Just listing a bunch of icons in no particular order makes finding what I'm looking for very difficult - no, I don't care if I can rearrange the icons, folders are my method of organizing my chaos. codemonkey85 Honestly, I'm more than a little surprised that there isn't at least a search bar on chrome://apps. TheSpaceUnicorn You can also just make shortcuts to each chrome app on the desktop, taskbar, or start menu. TheSpaceUnicorn the Google Play store coming to Windows 10 through Chrome would instantly make the Surface the best tablet on the market imo. codemonkey85 I don't entirely agree with that, but it would be a massive boost. TheSpaceUnicorn The Surface has it's drawbacks, but the Surface offers a ton of stuff for me professionally (Adobe CC) that's great to have on a tablet. The biggest issues with the Surface for me (aside from battery life) is the content consumption and app ecosystem isn't that great at all, and android apps coming to windows 10 would solve both of those issues. If it's between an Android tablet, a ChromeOS tablet with Android apps, or a Windows tablet with Android apps the Windows tablet would, in my opinion, be the best because it would have Adobe CC. That said, a ChromeOS tablet with Android apps and offline Adobe CC (not just streaming version of photoshop and the web version of lightroom) support would be my dream tablet. codemonkey85 Ah, fair enough. For me the SP3 wasn't a good enough laptop (couldn't even really prop it on my lap, keyboard didn't feel good, not enough power for my line of work) or a good enough tablet (I mainly use a tablet for consumption, and as you pointed out it lacks in that department, plus battery life wasn't the greatest, and the last thing I want to see when I start a consumption device is the 'installing updates' screen). As always though, your mileage will vary! catalysto The Surface Book is pricey, but it resolves the issues you mention. codemonkey85 Maybe, but I have a Windows laptop through my job, so meh! catalysto Can't argue with that! K.P. Smith Actually, judging from your past, I'd say you certainly could argue with that given you seem to find a way to argue with everyone about anything. Brian Demodulated I agree with you. Or at least it would be the best portable PC on the market. blindexecutioner Android apps on Chrome OS. Those should be a joy to use... Howard Stern loooooooooove it, finally! most chromebooks are 16-32gb tho....wonder if they will have a way to install stuff over Drive with files stores locally (somehow)? Merags BRB crying tears of joy Dean U back? Merags Yes, thanks for checking in. makapav Had 911 on standby. Tailor00 Awwwwwwwwwww grizzlyjon83 This will automatically make Chromebook tablets much more useful than android tablets. philosopher_Mk If Google is smart card they should partner with OEMs to make tablets with Chrome os. But doubt OEM's will like the idea of making product that they can't modify . Dean WEll they made Pixel C, they can do it jonathan3579 Chromebook tablet? I have no idea what you're talking about.. grizzlyjon83 OK, convertible touchscreen Chromebook. Poor choice of words on my part. jonathan3579 Ah! Thanks for the clarification. :) Alex My Chromebook Flip works pretty great in tablet mode. Fatal1ty_93_RUS Are there any Chrome OS tablets even? Otherwise we don't know if there's going to be a market for them Johnny Makes me compelled to net a Chromebook.. sebastianer I hope with this people will be able to run any kind of videos using some Play Store app like VLC, etc. Drakenoid VLC is already available for Chrome OS. Badouken https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vlc/obpdeolnggmbekmklghapmfpnfhpcndf?hl=en Bryan Pizzuti Take my personal information, please! Jordan Hotmann I see what you did there sagg damn! What are u doing down here? to the top Another Scott This sounds promising. Never having used any Android apps on my Chromebook, I hope they'll have them running in a "window" rather than simply scaling them to take over the whole screen. Having Pimlical running on my Chromebook 2 would be quite nice. Cheers, Scott. Robert Firestone Like what the Remix OS 2.0 does? MG Chromeos on pixel c please. With android it sucks David Onter This makes RemixOS obsolete (but it's still pretty cool and I like my Remix Mini). turco320 Remix (RIP) OS Smply_Rckless Now I'll actually use my Chromebook !!! Fatal1ty_93_RUS This would be a dream come true, to be able to just boot up my Chromebook, open up the Play Store, install any Android app I want, and use it like I would on a desktop computer (maybe resizable windows and multiwindow support in N Preview was a preparation for this?) But knowing Google and their attempt with ARC runtime.... the future isn't too bright if it will require any sort of additional work from developers, because no one is gonna give a shit AbbyZFresh It's not gonna compete with Windows. Windows has support of legacy programs. ConCal Apples and oranges. ConCal The Chromebook Pixle is looking pretty good right now. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman This is a step toward me taking Chrome OS as seriously as I want to. I have an original Cr-48 which I loved, and I always wanted to be able to consider an actual switch to Chrome OS, but the app support wasn't there. Meanwhile Android apps overall were nearly at the point where I could consider them as desktop-class. This crossover, if it's done right, could finally provide me that ability. Dmitry Stepanushkin cant wait to try Chrome for Android on Chrome OS. Frollino Chromeception. Benedict This is the moment, a chromebook / chromeOS get's interesting... I am not a naysayer I am going to be a mind readers for a moment. Everyone is super excited about this... Google announces it... then every Google fan will complain how so few apps are useable with mouse and keyboard... there will be several "Artems Luck" posts complaining about how MOST of the apps on the play store are awful with mouse and keyboard. It will also take Google a good year to deploy mouse and keyboard support to all their apps. the end Đức Thành I have never wanted a Chromebook as much as I do now. If only it was easier to get one in my country... AnoNYC Very cool, though the main feature I want on my Chromebox is notifications from phone. I want to be able to both receive text messages and phone calls on it. Built in. thespacecowboyx Game changer TigerMike901 My ASUS CB Flip was born ready...bring it Google!!! atc-tech me too! me too! HAHA. Side note: the ASUS CB Flip is awesome. I just wish it didn't have a proprietary charger; and was using a micro-usb. -Matoro Zeliph- This should come to chrome browsers as well. Not just Chromebooks. Tailor00 ARTEM APK PLZ CMON MAN disqus_QQmo5i3vVTT Chrome OS and Android are both OS's. If Google switched to Android the core programs like gmail, docs, etc would be the same. There would be two differences. The team would only have to concentrate on one OS and all the android apps would work naively. Google could design the Android interface to look like Chrome OS and you would think you are in Chrome OS. Lars Jeppesen I care more about Web apps than Android apps.. Native code is so 2015 mark Most Android apps don't use native code. Hakan Fondo I'm going to buy chromebook rightaway! Where is my keys? Rob Looks like a great idea, except I wonder how they'll handle the smaller HDDs that are on all these C-books we've already bought. Frank Sarfino I cant wait this is going to really take my chromebook to the next level !!!! Jeffrey Heesch This will add some seriously huge value to Chrome OS. Can't wait for this to finally hit.

Baig 3 hrs ago SHARE SHARE TWEET SHARE EMAIL All the MPs standing down before the 2017 General Election Queen Elizabeth II turns 91: Britain's symbol of stability is slowing down © Provided by USA Today Among the first things you might ask the cloud-based voice activated Google Assistant inside Google Home is to “tell me about my day.” Google Assistant will then rattle off the local weather, upcoming appointments, and connect you to preferred news sources. Until now, though, the standalone artificial intelligence-infused $129 speaker--Google’s rival to Amazon’s popular Alexa voice-based Echo speaker--couldn’t distinguish your voice from that of a spouse, partner or roommate. Heck, they want to hear about their day too. On Wednesday, Google began rolling out a feature to remedy the situation in households with a shared Google Home unit: the ability for up to six people to connect their account to that unit and, following a brief training period, have the speaker recognize each person’s voice independently. Google Home can then deliver their commute times, calendars, playlists, and so on--not yours. It’s a welcome feature that addresses a potential nuisance--and is a stunt Alexa can’t yet pull off on Echo devices, though I'm sure Amazon is at work trying. © Provided by USA Today You’ll need the latest Google Home app to get started. Then, look for a card that says “multi-user is available” and if you can’t find it, click the icon in the upper right to locate your connected devices, and make sure to link your account. Google asks you to train your voice by saying the phrases, “Ok Google” and “Hey Google” twice each.  The way Google explains it, the phrases are analyzed by a neural network which can detect certain characteristics of each voice. From then on, any time you say "Ok Google" or "Hey Google" to your Google Home, the neural network will compare the sound of your voice to its previous analysis to determine if it is you speaking or not, a comparison Google claims takes place in a matter of milliseconds. Google shows off how it works in this promotional Google Home video. A few things to keep in mind: If you have more than one Google Home in your house, you’ll have to set up each one independently even if you share the same network; voice training is local to the device.  The feature doesn’t work on smartphones that incorporate the Google Assistant either, though phones of course are more personal anyway. Google also adds that the feature is not available for kids under 13. The feature rollout comes to the U.S. first and will expand to the U.K. in coming months, Google says. I’m eager to test it out with family members in my house, and will update this post if I encounter any snags or surprises.

According to The Wall Street Journal, the feature will “filter out certain online ad types deemed to provide bad experiences for users as they move around the web.” Google is expected to introduce the ad blocking feature within the next few weeks. Date Set for Uber Appeal in UK Uber’s fight against greater regulation in the UK marches on. The sharing economy poster child has been given a September 27 hearing date to appeal a ruling in the UK that declared its “self-employed” drivers should be given the same rights granted to official employees, according to The Guardian. China Keeps Buying Stuff from South Korea Despite ongoing political tensions between the governments of China and South Korea, digital shoppers in China show no signs of decreased demand for goods from South Korea. The Korea Trade-Investment Promotion Agency reported that 13.6% of direct overseas purchases by Tmall shoppers in China came from South Korea, behind only the US and Japan. China has placed restrictions on imports from South Korea as part of the fallout over South Korea’s decision to install a US missile defense system on its shores. Value of Lost Taxes on UK Ecommerce Tops £1 Billion The UK government lost between £1 billion and £1.5 billion ($1.53 billion and $2.29 billion) in tax revenues last year due to online sellers based outside the European Union failing to charge value-added tax (VAT) on their goods located in the UK when sold to UK customers, according to an investigation by the UK’s National Audit Office (NAO). The UK’s tax authority, HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC), “has not yet been able to assess how much is due to lack of awareness, error or deliberate fraud,” NAO’s report said. US Millennials Vote for Snapchat Stories In two separate surveys conducted in November–December 2016 and April 2017 by millennial consumer insights company Whatsgoodly, millennials overwhelmingly preferred Snapchat stories to Instagram’s version of the feature. In the tail end of 2016, 88% preferred Snapchat stories. While that number fell by 10% in the April survey, the scant 4% who preferred Instagram stories remained the same. Maybank Launches Payment Gateway Malaysia-based bank Maybank introduced a new payment gateway called Maybank2u Pay, which is intended to serve as a payments solution for emerging ecommerce businesses in the country. The service is targeted at small and medium-sized businesses in Malaysia that may not have the resources to develop their own digital payment methods. eMarketer estimates retail ecommerce sales in the country will reach $2.41 billion this year. Uber Central Now Available in India US-based ride-hailing platform Uber rolled out Uber Central, a feature geared toward corporate clients, in India. The service allows door-to-door transportation to be dispatched centrally for corporate users who don’t need an Uber account to make use of the service. Instead, riders can receive text notifications regarding ride details. Uber said more than 8,000 firms had already participated in an Uber Central pilot program, including over 50 in India. —Cliff Annicelli, Rahul Chadha, Rebecca Chadwick, Rimma Kats New Report in eMarketer PRO This Week Worldwide Ad Spending: The eMarketer Forecast for 2017 Paid media advertising outlays worldwide will increase 7.3% in 2017 to $583.91 billion.

WSJ: Google planning to block bad ads in Chrome on desktop and mobile Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/04/19 6:31pm PDTApr 19, 2017 67 Plus 1 on G+ 132 Share on Facebook 74 Share on Twitter Total Shares273 Google News Rumors Advertising is very much a balancing act for websites these days. You want to make enough money from an ad-supported site to cover costs, but you don't want to annoy users to the point they block all your ads. Some websites don't seem to care how much they annoy you, though. Google is reportedly getting ready to take a stand against the worst ads on the web with a built in ad-blocker for Chrome. According to the Wall Street Journal, Google's ad-blocking feature could be turned on by default in the desktop and mobile versions of Chrome. It would filter out only the ads Google deems unacceptable. That would cover things like pop-ups, auto-playing video ads, and “prestitial” ads with countdown timers. Google may even build the feature such that it blocks all the ads on a site that serves one of these unacceptable ads. That would nudge website operators to get all their ads in order—after all, Chrome is a huge chunk of usage. Google has not commented on the Wall Street Journal's story, probably because it's still trying to figure out how to pitch the ad blocker (if it's real). This could be seen as an attempt to coerce website operators to only run Google's AdSense ads, which are guaranteed not to run afoul of Google's blocking policies. It's a risky direction for an advertising powerhouse like Google to go, but it might not see a better way to deal with the prevalence of ad-blocking.

AbbyZFresh What did WSJ do to you? Nathan J What did they do for you? The Wall Street Journal is owned by Rupert Murdoch's News Corp, which runs the propaganda arm of the Republican party in the US, better known as Fox News. Murdoch's interference in politics and opposition to freedom isn't limited to the US. I don't recall the details, but the EU or UK was about to kick him out for starting trouble over there a year or two ago. I'm not real big on politics, but I think a certain distrust of News Corp, to a point, is healthy and should not really be questioned. Cakefish You might be referring to News of The World - a British tabloid newspaper run by Rupert Murdoch that was closed down a few years ago because it was found to have spied on people's phones. This included hacking the phone of a murdered teenager and soldiers who had died in combat. It caused a massive uproar. ZettabyteGamer Spread a lot of false information about YouTubers, and YouTube as a platform. They focus on clicks, and getting subscribers instead of accurate information reporting. givitumibeybi WSJ is a wannabe BuzzFeed newspaper. Trooper311 Awesome. Josh Crumley Good. Those ones where you load a page and start reading then suddenly disappears and a fullscreen ad with a 5 "second" timer starts going that takes about 5 seconds *per* second...ugh (looking at you gawker media). I just hope they don't automatically assume all google ad placements are ok just because they're google ads. DozensOfUs If you read gawker sites, it means you're a liberal weenie and deserve to be annoyed. Josh Crumley It was a kotaku article about zelda breath of the wild... 😆😄 https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/d88dd0554cbbcfbefae945805e94ca40e0596a9a2abfb8beb5f9b9b849ce1225.gif Martin The one that are making Sound and are pretty much impossible to close need to be first!!! (You won an iPhone - beeeeeeeeeeeeeep beeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeep beeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeep)... :) DragoCubed The vibrations! MJ Cool I guess but I recommend everyone just get a real ad blocker like uBlock Origin and be done with it. RyRyTheFunBun I begrudgingly use Dolphin on all my Android devices for the ad blocker. Their are better, but dolphin renders almost all sites correctly and is fast. freshprince_87 Chrome is better D.Smithee Are you kidding me? You're using that shitty adblocker add-on for Dolphin? That extension hasn't been updated in years. Just use Brave Browser for Android--it's essentially Chrome with adblocking, tracker blocking, HTTPS and fingerprinting protection with a few added necessities. Nathan J On mobile, just run a system-wide ad blocker. AdGuard on Android and AdBlock on iOS. Chrome works just fine with no ads seen anywhere. MJ Nothing wrong with Adguard but installing a whole app seems overkill when an browser add-on will do. I really have no interest in using Chrome on mobile. ZettabyteGamer What mobile browser do you use, our of curiosity? My1 well because if you do things like adaway and whatnot all the apps' ads will be kicked right into oblivion and not just the browser's ones. also when you have root, you can let the adblocker just play with the hosts file and let the networking layer do its thing. MJ I just need an ad blocker for the browser. I normally don't install programs that don't let you pay to remove ads. Root is a go since I use Android Pay. Finding it weird I have now had a half dozen replies giving me suggestions and "solutions" yet I didn't express having any problem... My1 well I dunno how secure android pay is but unless there is a chip similar to a smartcard or apple's secure enclave in the phone which stores all the needed data, it can be copied, effectively killing everything. I like my banking card with chip which is pretty much exactly a smart card meaning you cant read out any data without essentially destroying the card itself, and if made properly, the data will destroy itself when tampering happens. MJ I don't know where you live but in the US the smart chip on cards as been a disaster. This is the procedure to do a transaction... 1. Look at machine and wonder if the smart card reader is active? Is there a sign? Will the clerk tell me? No? Ask or guess... 2. The smartcard reader is active so now have to choose 1-3 options with buttons than wait 5-10 seconds for the transaction to be done. 3. Be startled by the annoying sound many terminals make like there was a error but it just means remove your card. Security? The magnetic stripe is still there! The procedure for a wireless transaction... 1. Look for the wireless/Android Pay symbol. Hold phone up to terminal and a second later transaction is done. Security? I know it uses end-to-end encryption for transactions. What will copy what and how? Carsten AdGuard is not for your browser, but for your whole system. So, "Free with ads" becomes basically free, for example ;) Nathan J Or "free with a white space taken out from where the ad was." Some ad blockers on the computer (or most now, maybe) can also remove the space, but we're not there yet on phones. Of course, you shouldn't use an ad blocker to rip off app developers. Buy the ad-free version. The only one I'm not doing that for is the weather apps. Most of them won't let you just buy an ad free version. They'll let you take the ads off for a year, but then they come back and/or they charge you again. Pretty greedy! Of course, there are pay-once weather apps, but the popular ones (Weather Channel, Weather Underground) only have the subscription. (I really need to just suck it up and get Dark Sky...) Carsten Well, we are - in most apps I don't get empty spaces. In Chrome definitely not, AdGuard uses some stuff (I don't know how) to remove the spaces entirely. Also: you can get lifetime licenses ;) For details, see this. They have written about such things just a few days ago: https://blog.adguard.com/en/adguard-vs-adaway-dns66/ Cakefish BBC Weather app. Free with no ads. Nathan J Android only? UK only perhaps? BBC is great but often they limit things to people who pay their fees — which is completely understandable. But when the Boston Marathon bombing happened, I went straight to the Beeb for coverage, online, in the US, and it was pretty great. Live video coverage, live tweets from their people (I guess), and a summary of what went down. They're the best. Cakefish Android and iOS. I checked on the website and apparently it's only available to download in the UK. That's a shame as it's a great app but understandable. Nathan J That's a pretty arbitrary limitation, and why I got a 128GB phone. Probably more than I need, but I've used more than a 64GB phone will hold. I don't know about Adguard on Android, but AdBlock on iPhone uses 16.9MB of space. That's with its filters. The app and its data and cache. And apps are usually bigger on iOS because, unlike Android, they can't share libraries, they're totally sandboxed. My biggest space hog is Spotify at 35.4GB. But again, why I got a 128GB phone. Second biggest is a game taking up about a tenth of that. Followed by VLC, which contains all videos stored on this phone (I don't use iTunes). Get a bigger phone, man. You'll thank yourself for it many times. Or go on arbitrarily limiting yourself. But don't think it's anything but that. MJ What? I don't need a bigger phone? I mentioned nothing about storage? Limiting myself? What are talking about? LOL How about you stop trolling? Nathan J This word, trolling. It doesn't mean what you think it means. If anything, you were trolling and I tried to respond rationally. Grow up. MJ You wrote a 100 some word essay about how I needed a "bigger" phone that was not relevant to anything. BLOCKED Nathan J Run on home to your safe space, bully. Ladies and gentlemen, this is why you stand up to bullies. They usually fold. Occasionally, in epic fashion. Especially online when they find out they don't have quite the presence they do on the playground. Jorge I guess no ad blocker will work on Android if you still use Chrome. Chrome serves the content right to you instead of your phone fetching the content from the source website. You need to use a different browser to block ads. Nathan J You guess incorrectly. What you're experiencing is Google proxying around your ad blocker. You have Chrome's data saver turned on. Bypassing your ad blocker is an unintended side effect. Turn off the data saver feature and the ad blocker will in fact block ads in Chrome. Chrome is not magically evading your ad blocker. You're just using Google's proxy instead of the one your ad blocker establishes. And that's really all there is to it. However, the Google App on iOS (Google Search + Now) will always proxy around an ad blocker. I don't know if it's a data saver that just can't be disabled (which would explain it) or malice on Google's part. I'm leaning toward the latter. But the fact remains, if I Google gaming stuff and go to a Wikia site, I get slammed with ads. If I Bing it, the ads don't show up. And Bing makes a great app. Shame fandroids slam it Because It's Not Google. Real shame. They're missing out. Jorge Adguard tells you what browsers work with adblockers on install. They only accept Yandex and Samsung Internet. There's no option to make it work with Chrome and I'm forced to install one of those if I want to continue with the installation. Anyways, I'll give it a try disabling data saver but it hasn't worked in the past with other ad blockers. Carsten AdGuard DOES work with Chrome, but not the browser-plugin adguard, you have to use the full app adguard. It even works with data saver, what confuses me, but it does. Necdet Ali Özdür Try Samsung Browser on mobile, it supports ad blocking. MJ I already have an ad blocker and no interest in the Samsung browser. LOL Hrishikesh Bisen Why? bekifft I've been impressed with Brave, it's basically uBlock plus https everywhere. Or Adguard if you must use Chrome. It's worth it. I wouldn't mind ads if they didn't try to hijack my phone and install malware. senor_heisenberg Noice, about time. Tom Erlandsen Google working on an ad-blocker? Now there's something I never expected to read haha JD Gotta finish off the competition somehow. They weren't going to do it by releasing polished products Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ LOL, unfortunately, true. My1 google releases polish products? do they also have a subcompany on Poland? SCNR. demarcmj He said "They weren't going to do it by releasing polished products" Bombaglad have you ever heard of editing comments? Jorge Yes, only Adsense will pass the "fair ad policy" and will be correctly displayed. All the other "your phone is full of viruses" won't be displayed. I will miss the sexy vibrations in my hand. :-( JG Does ChromeOS fall into the desktop category? or is this going to be browser only? kenspiracy ChromeOS would fall into the desktop category, yes. 4Ui812 Adgaurd for the win and the block. Untung Dwi Prasetyo Yes D.Smithee They make a great content blocker for Samsung browser--and let's face it, their Adguard VPN blocker for unrooted Android is a godsend. Cakefish I have a choice to use either the preinstalled Chrome browser or the preinstalled Samsung Internet browser on my phone. Samsung Internet supports adguard content blocker. Chrome does not. The choice is clear. In fact, it's hard to call it a choice. There is only one viable option to take. D.Smithee Did you not see my mention of the Adguard VPN that blocks ads in all browsers? So, yeah--you can use Chrome. Carsten I never thought I would pay for an ad blocker, but AdGuard ist sooooooo ♥ ♥ ♥ ! Also, right into the face of haters: "There is no get-everything-free-world today!" - "Dude, I'm actaully PAYING for not seeing ads!" :D Madis Surely you're paying, but who the money goes to is what matters... Carsten Yep, it is. You see, the argument against adblockers is: "There must be ads, otherwise everything would cost money and don't tell me you would pay for stuff online! Aha! So don't be an a-hole and disable your adblocker." But: I am paying! That's the point: Not just being a guy who wants everything for free, but saying "yes, I am okay with paying for good content." Problem is, websites with ads are no good content, while an adblocker is. Johny M This is not good. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/a6fddce77432d41dfcd3c6f79fcc7fa1244c36a5ce08a0227a141e8521e57f3e.gif So the biggest online add company will punish websites that post "bad" commercials. What can go wrong with that? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Exactly. Google ad services monopoly, here we come. Necdet Ali Özdür It's been done before. I mean blocking "bad" commercials. Almost all browsers now have an option to block pop up pages. I consider this an extension of it. rockstarr27 Google will use it to block non google approved ads, furthering their monopoly. Predictable. 4Ui812 Bingo MaroonMushroom All of the bigger advertising companies would probably meet Google's standards without issue. I'm sure the bar will be set low enough to mostly target the full screen ads that say your Android phone has 6 memory viruses while it's vibrating at you. rockstarr27 "Google will only block the bad ads, they wouldn't ever try to make their ad blocking more dominant compared to competitors with this move." - Ah to be young and naive. saf1927 Ah yes, because they want another antitrust case on them. As if Android weren't enough of a headache. Yep, really nice to be naive. LAMMJR O plz god yes, block those stupid ads that block chrome in android, spamming pop ups and using vibration saying my phone will be destroyed in x seconds if I don't install whaterver app they tell me to. Carson Saldanha Omg fr. I can't believe this is still a thing. Max I only can wish suffering to whoever developed those nasty ads. Nicoleckeys Google is paying 97$ per hour!

Mr.Bean ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I would think they put those ads for curious eyes. LOL Stop playing with yourself and these ads will disappear! Defenestratus Sadly it's not just porn sites that have those these days. LAMMJR This is not exclusive to porn sites, porn sites are probably worse. Any site that offers ad-suported download can end up having one of those annoying ads. For example, sites that uses ad.fly as url shortening can end up stuffing this type of ads on your face. Modest Mind I'm not sure Google will integrate an adblocker to Chrome because Google and Ads are synonymous. Unless Google integrates an add-blocker that has a "white list" and Google Ads are at the top of that list. demarcmj They're just blocking "bad" ads Randroid Read the article. It's going to be the opposite. It's going to be a blacklist of ads that are dangerous, annoying, or intrusive Modest Mind Annoying, intrusive? That is the definition of Google ad business... justmy2pennies2012 The ones the block what you are reading and stays oin the screen as you scroll down are the worst. alexb88 Use Adguard! YaKillaCJ Oh that sounds horrible. I didn't kno ads got that bad. Been using AdAway for years now. Latheryin Ads will never be accepted by everyone. A lot of people see no use for them at all and will continue to block all ads. If they wanted commercials they can watch cable. Max Be careful with what you wish, the day ads die is the day everything will be paid on internet. TechGuy22 Like pirate don't exist lol tookieboy stupid people do though. happy pirating your gmail account Latheryin Yeah that will never happen. Even if it cuts people's use of the Internet by 65% that would not be a bad thing. And like TechGuy22 said. It will be broken. DragoCubed I can see a future with less outright box ads and ads that are hard to even tell that they are ads. Sponsored content and stuff. TechGuy22 Block these ads or the hijacked one on here specially https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/1abd2d9979769332aaaefa91b671e6683737b8fb001f1b9b41820b6a94d1eee9.png Josh Crumley But look at this one weird trick I learned! https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/c8c0b953c6e85700fbc7f7073a9f5ec68cb6a87dbf0c0afbca12b88428163ea5.png ilovetesla seriously , try it , its very good and a healthy tip for the phone internet never lies Jorge That only works on iOS.

No other ads make your phone vibrate that sexy. Bruce Wayne Jorge, I'm going to need you to take your phone out of your pants. Jorge Why? I like the vibes inside my pants. They put me in the mood. Cakefish And Taboola and Revcontent jonzey231 "You'll never guess what she looks like now!!" Brian Kittelson I have add blocked these. Some of these are borderline NSFW. I don't need T&A ads while browsing a tech news website at work thank you. DragoCubed Awesome sauce LOL So no more pussiеs and тiтs on the side bar? Damn.... Michael Hazell Never thought I'd see the day that Google would assume the role as an ad blocker, but honestly I appreciate them filtering those ads on mobile devices where it's like "your device has 6 million viruses, install to fix." Those are just cancer and needed to be blocked anyways. I've been such a heavy ad blocker that I forgot what it's like to deal with cancerous ads on the internet. xmascarroll For some reason, my stock V20 always gets "Android Alert! Your device, GENERIC ANDROID DEVICE, has xxx viruses! Run Android GENERIC ANDROID DEVICE Cleaner now!" D.Smithee We'll assume you didn't run said cleaner. ilovetesla then, follow the instructions, its a generic cleaner Jorge What are you waiting for? Go do that right now. Your phone and your bank account will appreciate that. YuCMi Yes please! If this works the way it is described here, I'll turn off my indiscriminate adblocker. Dmitry Stepanushkin ADBlock. Problem solved 😂 Lord Argyris Somehow I'm categorizing this one in the "I'll believe it when I see it" category. It sounds an awful lot like an Outbrain story, which, incidentally enough, is one of the reasons people run ad blockers. That all said, these are the kinds of things I want to see blocked: -Anything that autoplays, makes noise, etc. -Anything that blinks, pops up, obscures the screen, or otherwise tries to distract me -Clickbait repos -Any and all forms of tracking--leave ad content selection up to the host site, or just push random ads The first two might be reasonably expected from a hypothetical Google ad blocker, but the third is questionable (the stories don't usually run afoul of the other criteria on the list; they're just trashy and take up page space and bandwidth). For the last one, however, I can barely hear myself typing over the laughter of the big ad companies (Google included). Tracking makes ads much more effective, and I don't see anything (apart from federal regulation, which has its own problems, not to mention scope limitations) that will ever manage to shove that genie back into the bottle. I'll play along with the rumor for a moment. What Google is likely doing here is protecting not just its ad revenue, but its ability to build up tracking data, which is immensely valuable. Trackers can be blocked by sufficiently motivated individuals, and third party extensions make this a lot easier. This is where Google wants to move in. By offering a basic solution to casual ad blockers, who just don't want to deal with the annoyance and page slowdown of heavily ad-infested sites, Google is ensuring that those tracking cookies are still set and that it (Google) and other third party ad companies can keep harvesting that data, even if people aren't seeing as many annoying ads. As an end user, this benefits me in some ways and hurts me in others. On the one hand, I feel like the presence of a Chrome-native, on-by-default blocker will bring about at least some progress on eradicating the Internet of the worst ad offenders, particularly if the penalty for non-compliance is that your site gets no revenue whatsoever from Chrome users who stick with the defaults. On the other hand, this will put the squeeze on more capable third party extensions that offer more granular control (as well as the ability to block more than just the ads themselves), which might drive some of them out of the market. Also, it abstracts the issue of tracking away from ad blocking--everybody can see the ads (and be creeped out at how relevant they are), but fewer people know about the tracking behind the scenes. If Google just makes some of the most annoying ads go away, many people will be satisfied, even if the tracking is still taking place. It also seems dangerously close to the sort of anticompetitive behavior commonly associated with late 90s-era Microsoft, since it's clear Google isn't being altruistic here. It's going to benefit from this initiative, and disproportionately to the other players in the market (both ad blockers and other ad companies). Notice what's not ever going to be blocked: Google-sourced ads. Everything else is theoretically fair game. Companies looking to advertise, as well as sites looking for ad revenue, will both be more confident in going with the Google ad platform than with competitors because they know that their ads will be compliant and that they won't risk losing revenue due to Google's ad blocker. We'll see how this shakes out. If a Chrome ad blocker is indeed under consideration, I suspect this information was purposely leaked to see what sort of reaction it gets. ast00 Block ads? Yes, please. Only accept AdSense? Oh hell no! (please link the gif) bozzykid The report says it will use the same "Acceptable Ads" that Adblock Plus supports so it wouldn't be accepting just Adsense. tookieboy don't bother.. people don't read ast00 I know what it says, but Google is no stranger to uncompetitive tactics. bozzykid I'm not sure you can read. The report makes it clear. Cory Wilson I want to be rid of the stupid ads that take over the whole screen and say "congratulations we're giving away giftcards to users who live in , you have 5 minutes to redeem". you can't get out of them unless you close the window and reopen. Anonymous and what about adsense? My1 well I think google isnt stupid enough to make adsense that bad so it would fall under the blocking guidelines, I mean adsense ads I saw were iirc usually just banners on the top, bottom or side. cr08 Yeah. Adsense has always been really lean and unobstrusive with their ads. I'd be happy with allowing adsense ads and also ads from other networks that are also unobtrusive. Hopefully with Google's knack for self learning algorithims they can nail this down. D.Smithee It's good news--but a little too late, Google. I've been using a content blocker since the very early 2000's with Firefox. Now I use uBlock Origin with Chrome desktop. I came to the conclusion a LONG time ago that sites don't have our best interests at heart. Even the ones that proclaim they do. For me, ads/trackers/etc. became a security issue quite some time ago--I just can't trust sites, so I just block ALL ads/trackers/undesirable content. And if a site objects to it or blocks users using content blockers, I just get my information elsewhere. It's that simple. Branko So awesome. Will it eventually filter "hate speech" and "fake news" too Google? If you want to place in a mechanism for ad blocking, users must have control over it. Otherwise it's prone to abuse of self interests. Go fuck yourselves Google. Disphouf Thats funny, I changed Chrome with Brave browser because their adblocker givitumibeybi lol. I can't understand why everyone is so excited. This will just be an Embrace, Extend, and Extinguish move. Kwetsima Maluleke Wow Google. Not bad. Its not like Samsung and Apple haven't had ad blockers for years now. givitumibeybi What's the difference between morals of using torrents to install overpriced things for free, and using adblockers to get access to the content of a website with disturbing advertisements for free? Cakefish - Taboola - Outbrain - Revcontent ^ THIS SCOURGE OF THE INTERNET MUST BE DESTROYED!!! I will not retire the use of my adblocker until those companies are wiped off the face of the planet. Truly, they are evil incarnate. They must die in a pit of flaming fury. Morten Ulv I wonder what happens on pages that block people from reading if they have an ad blocker. My mother would surely not know what to do. Markus Birth The fun thing is: Once EVERY Chrome user gets blocked from viewing those pages, they will very soon die or turn off their adblock-blocker. Better for everyone. Zach Mauch Hopefully it will also fight against adds using excessive processing. That is the major reason I still run it on sites as prominent as Android Central. They can just destroy performance. jonzey231 I could see this turning an anti-competition suit very quickly. It wouldn't be intentional but it would end up being Google blocking their own competitor's ads while allowing their own to flourish. It'll be seen the same as Android using only Google as the default search provider...and that definitely hasn't gone well for them abroad. Mark Curtis ALL ads are bad, I'm entitled to free content, gimme gimme gimme Chris Sanner I'll be honest - if they do this, I'd probably disable my other ad blocker entirely. I don't mind ALL ads, it's the ones that are COMPLETELY obnoxious that cause me to block the rest. currently most hated? the ones that show up as you scroll through a story and you have to scroll through them to get back to scrolling the site. John Petersen No way. This is just asking for abuse and conflicts of interest. Just enable add-ons for mobile, and let unvested third parties take care of the ad-blocking. PVL_93_RU I'm waiting to see how advertisement companies find a way around this built-in blocking LOL I am using adblocker via router so all devices connected are blocked BC This would be a lovely thing because I only disdain the annoying adverts that pop up and block my screen...Banners aren't bad as I can see those without having content obscured, also Google needs to get better at blocking the ads that cause redirects. Those really piss me off. PIucky Duck 🇩🇪 Rooted phone with AdAway is the way to go F4LL0U7 FYI, Adguard for Android is awesome. No root required. They have a desktop Chrome extension too, if you like having your ad blockers match across all devices. Michael Payton Endgame will be to block all ads not sold thru Google. That's how they make most of they're money, and other people will have to advertise thru them to get their ads seen. Vivek Rameses Don't be fooled, all ads are bad. YaKillaCJ Or here's a better idea, allow extensions in mobile. Maybe keep it in the beta to keep away the average person or at least express its a little advance. Brandon Good! Google is the ONLY ad network I trust to not contain malware. Until these websites properly audit their ad content and ensure it's not laden with malware then I will continue running an ad-blocker and a DNS blackhole. Anyone with a Pi checkout PiHole. bekifft If only Google offered some sort of service that would let you pay them money to block the ads...you'd still contribute to the sites, but only the ones that serve Google ads. They could call it something like... Google Contributor maybe? Just a crazy idea... I know I'd use it...

What makes their immense popularity all the more remarkable is that they’ve achieved it without a key feature: Knowing exactly who’s talking. That changes with Google Home’s introduction of support for multiple accounts. Starting today, your Google Home device can identify as many as six voices, and summon information based on each person’s calendars, services, and preferences. In doing so, Google’s speaker-bound personal assistant becomes truly personal, unlocking the true potential of the most promising new category of consumer tech to come along in years. Oh, and it gives Google an important edge in the race with Amazon’s Alexa to own the next generation of interfaces. For now, anyway.

In practice, this means that once you’ve linked your account, saying “OK, Google, good morning” will conjure details from your calendar and news briefing preference, rather than defaulting to those of whomever set up the device. Extrapolate a bit further, and each individual in a household can summon everything from playlists to lighting cues to commute times tied to their specific routines. These fine-tuned interactions benefit Google, too. “If Alexa or Google Home is going to develop a conversational relationship with you, it needs to be able to know who you are, which things you’ve asked for in the past, what other content and services you have access to,” says Forrester Research analyst James McQuivey. “In short, the full potential of intelligent agents can’t be realized without individual voice recognition.” In fairness, you can change user accounts on Alexa-powered devices by going into the app. (And there’s little question Amazon also is working on the sort of feature Google just announced.) But the added friction obviates much of what makes digital voice assistants so pleasant to begin with. It’s such an obvious win, in fact, it raises an obvious question: What took so long? Speech, Memory It’s not that computers can’t already tell one voice from another. They just haven’t had much reason to. “Until relatively recently, it was mostly irrelevant in terms of how the technology works,” says Brian Langner, a speech scientist at computer conversation company Pullstring. “It was usually a single microphone that tried to pick up all the various things it could, identify the speech, and figure out what the words are.” Think of it in terms of dictation software. You speak, it listens and regurgitates. You don’t often see dictation by committee. Before today’s update, Google Home and Alexa applied that logic to far more complex interactions, from any number of speakers in a household. The devices continued improving their ability to know what you say, but haven’t cared much who was saying it. At most, you would expect a computer to know a single voice, and block out the rest. READ MORE: How to Keep Amazon Echo and Google Home From Responding to Your TV That served Google perfectly well on Android phones, where voice recognition allows you and you alone to unlock your device simply by asking nicely. Home presents a significantly different set of problems. “The nice thing about a phone is that it’s reasonable to assume that there’s only one person using it,” says Alex Rudnicky, a speech recognition expert at Carnegie Mellon University. “If you have something like an Echo, it’s not entirely clear who the user population is.” Ultimately, thanks to an assist from new neural networks running on the device, Hafsteinsson’s team smartened Google Home to the point that it just needs you to say “OK, Google” and “Hey, Google” twice each. With that, it knows you. Your voice also never leaves the device; Home does the identification onboard, and fetches the relevant info from Google’s servers. “It wasn’t necessarily that we couldn’t do it,” Hafsteinsson says, explaining the gap between Home’s release and the introduction of multiple accounts. “It just takes time to get the quality level that we thought was good enough.” Such concerns also informed the number of users Home can identify. Six seemed big enough to accommodate most households, without straining the device’s capabilities. That makes sense, given the difficulty of discerning and identifying too many voices—a problem even for humans. “When you start talking about constrained bandwidth situations, such as over the telephone, where you don’t have high-fidelity audio, even people are not necessarily great at identifying simply from the audio different voices that might sound somewhat similar,” says Langner. What the Google Home still doesn’t do, though, is ignore voices it doesn’t recognize to begin with. Private Little Chat Burger King sparked a flame-broiled furor recently with an ad explicitly designed to set off Google Home devices. As the camera pans in, an actor says “OK Google, what is the Whopper burger?” Because Google Home takes its commands from anyone, it would spout off the first sentence of the “Whopper burger” Wikipedia entry in response, until Google shut it down. RELATED: Amazon Alexa Hits 10,000 Skills. Here Comes the Hard Part This update wouldn’t have stopped the Burger King stunt. If another company tried it tomorrow, it would work. That’s by design; Google so far still prioritizes the ability to, say, allow dinner party guests tweak a playlist. “There’s a set of things that aren’t necessarily tied to a particular account that can still work,” says Hafsteinsson. “We’ve felt that there’s a ton of convenience about anybody being able to use those services.” There still could be value in at least giving users the option to only let Home (or, eventually, Alexa) play nice with authorized voices. “If I have my credit card registered with Amazon, there has to be some sort of guarantee that if stuff gets ordered that the proper charging is done,” says Rudnicky. Anyone with kids knows the danger of leaving them unattended with a voice-activated birthday list fulfillment machine. There’s always the chance Google will include the ability to lock down your voice-assistant device in an update, or that Amazon will bring it to Alexa. For now, though, it’s not a big enough deal to turn you off to Google Home. Especially now that once you turn it on, your digital assistant will know just how to assist you.

Google's strong reputation for innovation held a significant appeal to job seekers, said Randstad. Out of the nine criteria used to determine a company's attractiveness score, Google was ranked No 1 in all of them - leading the company to win the Randstad Employer Brand Award in its very first year in the running. The criteria this year include work-life balance, job security, pleasant work atmosphere and career progression. Google beat out last year's winner, local firm Changi Airport Group, which came in a close second, "an encouraging showcase of how local home-grown companies can continue to hold its own weight against global juggernauts when it comes to employer branding," said Randstad. This was also the fourth consecutive year Changi Airport Group was ranked in the top three. In third place was ExxonMobil. Three other sector awards for the most attractive employers were presented with CapitaLand topping the property & real estate category, DBS Bank, the banking & financial services group, and Thermo Fisher Scientific for the life sciences. The Randstad Employer Brand Award, previously known as the Randstad Awards, is presented each year to the most attractive employer in 26 countries after surveying over 160,000 global respondents. The 75 largest companies are selected in each participating country, usually with more than 1,000 employees. In Singapore, over 5,000 employees and job-seekers between the ages of 18-65 were surveyed. In Singapore, over 5,000 employees and job-seekers between the ages of 18-65 were surveyed.

Its annual developer conference here showed a rich mix of creative and sometimes crude work toward its many ambitious aims. Under the hood, Facebook and its cloud computing rivals are essentially global giant data farms where harvesting the good stuff depends on machine learning. Facebook’s engine is unique in part for how it aims to leverage both its global warehouses of servers, and its users’ smartphones. Facebook’s new Caffe 2 framework takes a page -- and a key developer -- from rival Google’s Tensorflow. Caffe 2 is a significantly upgraded version of the machine-learning framework originally created at UC Berkeley by Yangqing Jia. After graduating, he spent two years at Google working on Tensorflow and other projects before Facebook hired him in February 2016 as engineering lead for its AI platform. “We needed more flexibility, so we made [Caffe] more modular and friendly to different hardware back ends…mobile is a major interest,” said Jia in an interview with EE Times on the F8 show floor. Smartphones will use Caffe 2 models to recognize and enhance objects in photos, creating AR effects similar to Pokemon Go and Snapchat filters. The so-called “style transfers” mark Facebook’s first strategic steps to draw consumers into AR. On the show floor, Qualcomm showed neural-network software handling image recognition at 50 frames/second on the Adreno GPU cores in its high-end Snapdragon SoCs. That’s much faster than the 12 f/s the SoC’s Kryo CPU delivers as a default. This summer Qualcomm will release the software in a version that also uses its Hexagon DSP as an accelerator. Facebook is clearly betting on such capabilities being widely available in the future. For today it will have to deal with a widely fragmented handset market that lacks such support. Processor vendors will want to support all broadly used machine learning frameworks, but their efforts will take time. For example, ARM and Ceva, whose cores are widely used in smartphones, have so far expressed support for Tensorflow, not Caffe 2. Intel, Nvidia and Qualcomm were quick to say they will support Caffe 2. Facebook already uses Nvidia’s GPUs on it training servers. Jia suggested the door open is for Caffe 2 inference accelerators on its servers, similar to the TPUs Google started deploying in 2015. “We see [potential for] a lot of hardware optimizations…There are quite a few computation patterns stabilized enough for hardware to use, and more and more computation patents will stabilize,” he said. However, all the frameworks are still evolving to support a wider range of neural networks with higher performance. “It’s a healthy competition, in general we’re all searching for a better solution for A.I.—it’s like the evolution of programming languages,” he said. For its part, Facebook is replacing a mix of frameworks including Torch with Caffe 2. Facebook made the framework open source and will use it on all its machine learning jobs including computer vision and machine translation on servers. It also is working with rivals Amazon and Microsoft to make it easier for business users to tap into their AI services. “It’s about setting up development environments easily, similar to using pre-installed software,” Jia said. For its part, Google’s Tensorflow is being used by AirBnB, Dropbox, SAP, Twitter, Uber and Xiaomi. Overall, Facebook is behind its Web rivals in machine learning, according to Richard Windsor, analyst at Edison Investment Research. “AI remains essential to Facebook’s long-term growth as it is sitting upon a mountain of data but still is not in a position to really make the most of the insights and automation that it can provide,” Windsor wrote in a research note that cited progress in image recognition where the company has made significant hires. Qualcomm showed gains running Caffe 2 on its Adreno GPU. (Image EE Times) “Facebook had to move beyond Torch, which they use internally for research, since Torch is based on the Lua language,” said Karl Freund, a senior analyst at Moor Insights and Strategy. “Most AI programmers use and prefer Python, which is native for many other frameworks, including Caffe,” he said. “The largest cloud and Internet sites have developed and promoted their own AI frameworks to keep a competitive edge and develop a loyal ecosystem,” Freund said. “They cannot use someone else’s open source versions as these always lag the code used internally by as much as a year. Each company will have their specific area of focus, for example, Facebook focuses on imaging and Amazon focuses on natural language processing,” he added. Indeed, Facebook AI specialist Joaquin Candela showed how its Mask R-CNN algorithms can now tightly detect and classify people and objects—even when they are moving in video or have parts blocked by other objects. Candela claimed the enhancements in Caffe 2 provided 100x speedups in inference jobs run on smartphones. Its use in Facebook’s image and texting apps — Instagram and Messenger — “makes it the largest A.I. deployment ever,” he said in a keynote.

Even with multi-user support, Google Home can't create reminders or calendar appointments Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/04/20 1:39pm PDTApr 20, 2017 31 Plus 1 on G+ 20 Share on Facebook 40 Share on Twitter Total Shares91 Google Google Home News Videos Google announced multi-user support for Google Home earlier today, but it's only launching in the US right now. This is finally a chance for Google to rectify things and add all those features Home was lacking at launch, and indeed Google has included a few new features. We're still missing some big ones, though. You still cannot create a reminder or add events to your calendar. After going through the setup process for multi-user, Google Home has access to some of your personal account information. That allows you to ask questions about what's on your calendar, view photos tied to your Google Photos account, and so on. However, writing data to your account appears to be a sticking point. If you try to create a reminder or a calendar appointment, Home tells you it can't do that yet, just like it did before. Hopefully the addition of multi-user support will let Google add these very basic features soon. Seriously, adding something to your calendar has to be one of the most common tasks for a human assistant. It's certainly not impossible to do this stuff, either. Assistant on the phone can create reminders and events just fine. Tags Google google assistant google home video subscribe ...

I'll make millions (of reminders)! Good_Ole_Pinocchio Google can't even handle the basics of their own services here.....SAD! lzdking Make Google Great Again! #MGGA mark555055d Such a disappointment. Google better start ramping up the functions on this thing or it will fail. Also, if they do something stupid like releasing a Google home 2 anytime soon, the shit will fly. LondonLeedsFan I thought about Google Home 2 about 3 days after buying this one and realising it doesn't do so much... I can't help but think it's going to happen. mark555055d Yeah... i could totally see them doing something stupid like making a GH2, with bluetooth pairing capability, improving the mics and speaker, charging $30 more for it, and then giving it an "exclusive" software version that allows reminders and calendar support, all while leaving the GH1 back for months due to "hardware differences". LondonLeedsFan IMO something like this should not be on a 1 or 2 year upgrade cycle. If that's how it goes, I'll leave it! Pete Still no assistant on my Nexus 5X in the UK! LondonLeedsFan Have you set phone language to English US and got latest play services? That will basically push it to your phone within 5 minutes. Pete Latest Play Services (even gone for the beta), same with Google app. As for language, tried that & it didn't work, but why should I? They say it's available in the UK and various other manufacturers (Samsung, OnePlus etc) have made it available on theirs, but Google haven't rolled it out to Nexus devices over here yet. A farce. LondonLeedsFan I have a 6P in the UK and I've had it for about 6 weeks now. Strange. Roderick Gadellaa I don't have it on my Moto X 2014 either and I updated the Google app, Play Services and even edited the build.prop. Somehow it's not working for everyone yet. That said, on the Moto X it may be Moto Voice that's the problem because it also prevents Ok Google hotword detection from anywhere but the Google app itself - it doesn't even work in Google Now On Tap although the searchbar says "Say OK Google". Leonardo Baez create reminder to bitch about you. :,D brian. Careful, she'll turn that insult on you... sbeaulieu The biggest problem assistant got is support. Only one country(officialy). dcdttu Gotta have one before the other, maybe. So that's what they hopefully are going to do next. pfmiller Once you can distinguish between users that's all you should need for both reading and writing appointments. I'm wondering if they are not fully confident in the reliability of the multiple user recognition, so they figure implementing read-only functions is safer while they work on getting the reliability up. denisu So, am I right in saying it can only make calendar disappointments? elchuby Can't even do that. Crystalatracy Managing director of Google!, is explaining to users to start off "Work at home" method, that People have been doing for about one year now.

I'm more excited to find out how they intend to handle messaging, though. surethom I'm sorry but why can Google not do the most simplest things. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Because they're a bunch of overpaid prima donnas who think they're geniuses but can't even match what a simple diligent grunt coder can do. M6 Over 90% of those grunt coders you mention probably couldn't write a simple service that serves a 'hello world' webpage at the thousands of QPS that Google's least popular services have to handle. Most of the work done to spin up such a service are done by SREs not SWEs. This is why start ups can add features so quickly. They simply don't have that many users and can worry about scalability after they get popular, and they have months if not years to work out a scalable solution in the meantime. Also, most grunt coders that add features quickly end up accumulating vast amounts of technical debt in the code they write. Morten Ulv Readers of Android Police are highly trained in pitchforking and kneejerk reactions. No critical thought allowed here, get out! abqnm If I hired an assistant and he or she couldn't add appointments to my calendar, I'd fire that motherfucker on the spot. I guess it must be time to get jobs at Google. Because they sure as shit don't know what an assistant is or what they are supposed to be able to do. Morten Ulv I'm sure they are not aware of the problem and that you would totally be fix it in 5 minutes. That's how it is, I'm sure! Lateef Alabi-Oki I'm just glad that the multiuser support works as well as it does. It hasn't failed in distinguishing the voices in my household. My spouse told it to show pictures from Google Photos and it executed. It's truly magical. Forgive my honeymoon phase. I'll be back to bitching in a day or two. makapav The next thing Google needs to enable us family sharing of all pictures and albums instead of doing it one by one. mustbepbs Still can't even add time to an existing fucking timer. Seriously, this company has the weirdest priorities. makapav Stickers FTW! Duder12 Google literally just tackled the biggest hurdle. Its all game over from here on out for the competition. bozzykid Considering you can hardly do anything with the multi-user support, it isn't even clear if it truly works. Martin Still don't get the point of this trash... If it can't make a simple reminder or cal app... What for people use it? Weather? Time? When you are surrounded or 10 more gadgets doing the same (watch, phone, tv, Pc and many more)... This is why I am never too exited when Google releases something new, it's never good, not even close to what they promise it is going to be... :) Matt Terk I have 3 devices, whole home music is wonderful along with all the assistant functions and control of all my smarthome devices. It would be hard to live without it now. boop It's the cheapest cast-enabled speaker I know of and it works fantastically. The voice commands for pulling up music are also best-in-class. I have a few smart home devices as well and virtually any combination of words construable as a command mumbled from anywhere in the room will do what I want. I doesn't do everything it ought to but it does quite a lot and does it exceptionally well. jdrch Google Home: a solution in desperate search of a problem. Deeco AP is the biggest Android media site, please make articles about all the short comings of Google and shame them until we are heard. Too much crap going on itsatrap Why people buy this thing?

The company has added the locations of the UK's electric vehicle charging stations by incorporating data from Munich-based Cirrantic's Moovility service, which lists re-juicing points for cars made by Tesla and Nissan, among others. It has also added public bicycle rental and drop-off points to maps of London, New York and Paris in a catch-up to long-time mobile navigation leader Google, which has listed such stations in multiple countries for some time. Improving its mapping products has become a key focal point for Apple in its battle with Alphabet Inc.'s Google. In May last year, Apple's Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said his company would open a new Indian development centre in Hyderabad, with a specific focus on speeding up the development of more competitive mapping tools. It plans to employ as many as 4,000 people in that facility. In December, Bloomberg reported that Cupertino, California-based Apple is assembling a team to use drones to create and update map information faster than it can currently do with camera-equipped road vehicles. "There are thousands of layers of useful information that could be added to digital maps as an overlay," said Mr Martin Garner, an analyst at CCS Insight, "and there's a benefit in becoming known for adding as many as possible. But adding overlays like this is an enormous undertaking and needs an industrial approach in order to source, manage and maintain the information for a large number of layers across many countries." Apple first integrated transit information for the UK into Apple Maps in December, which includes route information for trains and buses across the nation, as well as London Underground services in the capital. According to data compiled by Zap-Map, there are just under 4,400 locations in Britain for recharging an electric vehicle. More than 3,000 of these will now be marked in Apple Maps. To identify these, Apple is using live data provided by Munich-based Cirrantic GmbH, a mobility services company founded in 2014, and pinpointing EV charge points on a map. Google lists charging points globally, but doesn't explicitly label them with easily identifiable icons. "We think that consistent, live information of the growing charger infrastructure increases the confidence of EV drivers and, especially with Apple Maps, attracts new user groups to sustainable mobility offerings like EV cars," said Mr Arne Meusel, CEO and co-founder of Cirrantic. "In the UK, we started with supporting the major charger operators, including Podpoint, CYC, Ecotricity, NPower and NewMotion. Any interested operator is welcome to set up a connection with us," he said.

Plastc joins the likes of Coin, declaring bankruptcy Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/04/20 2:39pm PDTApr 20, 2017 14 Plus 1 on G+ 45 Share on Facebook 41 Share on Twitter Total Shares100 News Some of you might remember Plastc. They were a company that jumped on the re-programmable credit card train Coin and Google Wallet started in '13 and '12, respectively. They may have been a bit later to the game in 2014 after even Google had decided that it wasn't a good idea anymore, but they made the attempt. Later even the funding-successful Coin had to close shop due to delays, problems, and a general failure to properly keep up with the market. Unlike Coin, though, Plastc never managed to actually deliver on a product. And now just like its forebears, Plastc has decided it's time to die. This news isn't entirely surprising. Plastc's preorder update messages started verging on the Saygus-esqe: making promises of more features and upgrades, and fewer mentions of actual dates. The Plastc subreddit even decided seven months ago that the business had become a scam and was recommending people to steer clear. The company nonetheless raised in excess of $ 9 million in preorders, which is quite a lot to cut and run with. Plastc, unlike Coin, never actually managed to make or deliver a product to anyone who purchased it. Hopefully at least some of the money is left to return to backers. If not, given the quantity of cash there's always the chance of a decent lawsuit against whatever or whoever is left standing after the bankruptcy settles. The full details of their message to those who preordered are too long to quote here, but their bankruptcy statement is included below.Feel free to check out the full details at the source link. We Regret to Inform You... For the past 3 years, our mission here at Plastc was to build and deliver the most technically ambitious smart card on the planet. After making enormous leaps in development, product innovation and progress towards our goal, Plastc has exhausted all of its options to raise the money it needs to continue. Plastc, Inc. is exploring options to file Chapter 7 Bankruptcy and will cease operations on April 20, 2017. While we have fallen short of our goal, we are proud of our team and the effort that went into developing a working Plastc Card. However, without the necessary capital to continue, all employees have been let go, which means that Customer Care and Social Media channels are unmanned or have been shut down.

Is there any recourse to a refund at this point? David Ruddock Declaring bankruptcy probably doesn't bode well for refunds, no. KlausWillSeeYouNow No kidding...But what about people who submitted a refund request before they declared bankruptcy that was never answered? That's the boat I'm in. Ryne Hager Bankruptcy might interfere with that. Thankfully there's always the potential recourse of personal liability on the part of whoever owned the joint. That's gonna depend on something like a class action, though. Christina B. Try your bank and claim fraud. If that don't work a class action lawsuit has been started. Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ You can always try to get your bank or credit card issuer to do a chargeback.

Aaron Huffman I 'pre ordered' and I've been very excited for it for so long however there is a big thing I have on this. All these news entries are saying raised $9M from backers or pre orders and all that however near the end of the pre order email I have it shows plain as day just as my bank statements: "Your card will be charged at time of shipping." tldr; I was not charged a dime because they weren't shipping. Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ There seems to be differing stories on this. Some email screenshots in /r/plastc don't show that line in the email and the posters have claimed they were in fact charged. If you didn't get charge, count yourself lucky you won't have to deal with the headache of losing $150 and trying to get it back. Aaron Huffman That's all between Stripe payment and Plastc because things just have been working the way they should for me also the Plastc charge has been a gut feeling in me for about 3 years to always keep that $150 in my bank account so I can get my shipment on time when they are ready because I'm not the best at my finances yet. I've been watching my emails and bank like a hawk waiting for either a charge, an update or a decline on my card from Plastc. sbeaulieu Was sure this was a second post about Saygus Ryne Hager Thank David for the picture idea. crutchcorn Why is Mr. Davenport standing on the tombstone?

Gery, SeYoung Lee, and Jacob Ninas* In the past week, how many devices have you used that were connected to the Internet or relied on an algorithm to accomplish a task? Likely, the number is upward of 10 to 15, and most of those devices are used daily, if not hourly. Examples may include a Fit-Bit, cell phone, personal computer, work computer, home monitoring system, car, Internet television, printer, scanner, maps, and, if you are really tech savvy, maybe your coffee pot or refrigerator. The Internet of Things (IoT) is bound by a mesh network that is increasingly connected to every part of our lives, and those devices are becoming increasingly reliant on each other to perform their functions.1 Computing devices, using advanced algorithms, are entering the machine-learning phase, a subset of computer science in which the computer is “learning” about the environment and presenting predictions based on available data and conditions.2 Trends include machine-autonomy and self-learning. The idea of interconnectivity is not only about the IoT but also the information that transits the Internet, and how it influences our daily decisions. The trend toward a worldwide mesh-network is nearing, and with the creation of an information technology (IT)-based domain comes increased understanding of the environment in which we live. There appears to be no deviation from Moore’s law, developed in 1965, and popularized and demonstrated since its inception. If Moore’s law continues to be upheld in the future, more apps, algorithms, and daily functions will link together each part of our lives, providing increased processing capability and a limitless stream of information creating maximum efficiency for humans. The Westphalian design of society and order contributes to the human need to work within a set of logical models, whereas the principle of international law and orderly division of nations enables sovereignty over territory and domestic affairs. It is possible that globalization, which would be nearly impossible without a relatively high transfer rate of information, will play a critical role and may challenge global order. Assuming an information advantage is required to achieve nation-state and military objectives, and information superiority is not guaranteed because of the complex IoT, how does the U.S. Government present effective and integrated information warfare capability (IW) in the information age? Moreover, if wars are fought in the information space, can they be won with information alone? In other words, can information warfare provide the ways and means to fight wars, as well as the ends? Also, does the U.S. Government need to invest in an organization responsible for the coordination and integration of IW capabilities and effects? To increase the U.S. Government’s capability and capacity, a new organization should be created within the U.S. Government to focus on information warfare, with a fundamentally different organizational structure than our current governmental hierarchical structures. Specifically, the U.S. Government subscribes to the diplomatic, information, military, and economic (DIME) model but does not have an organization designed to lead the information functions of this model. The Department of State coordinates the diplomatic role, Department of Defense the military role, and Department of Treasury the economic role. Twenty-first-century challenges presented by the IoT require a more innovative organization that promotes adaptability and agility in the information space, akin to models used at Google, Facebook, or Apple. Winn Schwartau, author of Information Warfare and recognized IW theorist, describes the information age as “computers everywhere.”3 The ultimate fact of the information age is the proliferation of IT, which “incorporates information systems and resources (hardware, software, and wetware) used by military and civilian decisionmakers to send, receive, control, and manipulate information necessary to enable 21st-century decisionmaking.”4 Additionally, the development of IT allows sharing of information in near real time, at an exponential rate, anonymously and securely. These advances can be used as an asset, but also pose a potential vulnerability to the United States, our allies, and our adversaries.5 It takes seconds to upload pictures or comments on social media networks. At the same time, adversaries can use these systems to gain access to critical information. According to a New York Times article, “In July 2015, 21.5 million people were swept up in a colossal breach of government computer systems that was far more damaging than initially thought, resulting in the theft of a vast trove of personal information, including social security numbers and some fingerprints.”6 The following list provides a general summary of the number of times systems have been attacked via cyber.7 The number of attacks on information systems has increased each year, reinforcing the fact that warfare is currently being conducted in the information space via IT. The Pentagon reports getting 10 million attempts a day. The National Nuclear Security Administration, an arm of the Energy Department, also records 10 million hacks a day. The United Kingdom reports 120,000 cyber incidents a day. That is almost as many as the state of Michigan deals with. Utah says it faces 20 million attempts a day—up from 1 million a day 2 years ago.8 To meet the challenge that exists in the information age, organizational changes are required. Modern ideas and incorporating industry concepts may be one way to traverse the information space and create an advantage in future conflicts. Within the IoT, actions take place in nanoseconds and occur billions of times daily. Big data concepts attempt to harness massive amounts of information and distill that information into something that a human can use to make a decision. In the near future, the information required to win the advantage over an enemy may be determined by who can extract data, identify key centers of gravity in the information space, and automatically take action though rule sets and computational criteria based on defined “rules of engagement.” The ability to harness big data exists now and is only increasing. Consumer product companies are mining Facebook, Google, and other data to understand customer preferences, global trends, and public opinion on matters of interest. From a military standpoint, understanding the information terrain in relation to the potential adversaries is foundational to discerning points for information operations (IO) across the range of military operations. Big data concepts used in business could be advantageous and used in information warfare. It is possible that data-mining and subsequently an information advantage could achieve objectives purely through IW alone. The United States has used various IW strategies, agencies, and professionals, with varying degrees of success. The U.S. Information Agency (USIA) was created in 1953 and was in service until 1999. USIA was designed to consolidate all information activities: [USIA] comprised all of the foreign information activities formerly carried out by the Department of State’s International Information Administration (IIA) and Technical Cooperation Administration, and by the Mutual Security Agency. Overseas, existing United States Information Service posts became the field operations offices of the new agency. The exchange of persons program conducted by IIA remained in the Department of State, but USIA administered the program overseas. The Department of State provided foreign policy guidance.9 Historically, information warfare was identified as critical to national security, and USIA was required to erode support for the Soviet Union during the Cold War.10 Today, we usually consider IW as the means, or sometimes a way, to achieve an objective. But currently we rarely think of IW as an end, even though we live in an information age where we are all affected by the information environment every day. Brian Nichiporuk, the author of “U.S. Military Opportunities,” discusses IW concepts and postulates: The goals of an offensive information-warfare campaign are to deny, corrupt, degrade, or destroy the enemy’s sources of information on the battlefield. Doing so successfully, while maintaining the operational security of your own information sources, is the key to achieving “information superiority”—that is, the ability to see the battlefield while your opponent cannot.11 In current and future warfare, information superiority could be the single most decisive factor. For instance, we could think about the China-Taiwan scenario. China is employing a robust IW strategy targeting the Taiwanese government in order to bring Taiwan under Chinese control, without engaging in kinetic war. They are simultaneously using information operations to delay U.S. involvement to the point where any outside interdiction occurs too late to affect the outcome.12 This concept is fully realized by a dedicated focus on IW strategy, organization, and capabilities. This could be analyzed best by Sun Tzu’s strategy: “To subdue the enemy without fighting is the acme of skill.”13 In another example, the Russian operations in Crimea provide a modern case study where the outcome of operations was directly attributed to IW principles and capability. Information Warfare: The Russian Invasion of Crimea The Russian incursion into eastern Ukraine, and eventual annexation of Crimea in 2014, serves as the current model of a sustained IW campaign and provides examples of successes and failures in these efforts. Russian IW, known as Reflexive Control, has its origins in Soviet doctrine and serves as a key component in their hybrid warfare operations.14 Reflexive Control “relies . . . on Russia’s ability to take advantage of preexisting dispositions among its enemies to choose its preferred courses of action.”15 During operations in Ukraine, Russia’s primary impediments included Western European powers and the United States. Russia took multiple actions to seize the advantage of preexisting dispositions among its enemies in order to conduct successful operations in Ukraine and, at the same time, avoid a large-scale confrontation with the West. As part of Reflexive Control, Russia utilized a well-coordinated denial-and-deception plan, called maskirovka, through the use of “little green men” to establish checkpoints and secure key terrain in Ukraine. These little green men operated with speed and efficiency, and wore no identifying patches or unit insignia. This lack of identification allowed Russia to deny any association with these forces, which were later acknowledged as Russian troops. By controlling information and being able to deny its involvement in the occupation of Ukraine during the early stages of the conflict, Russia was viewed as an interested party by the international community—as opposed to a belligerent. This fed directly into Russia’s view that Western Europe and the United States did not desire a direct conflict and would not press the issue of Russian involvement, even if discovered. The ability to operate in relative secrecy also allowed Russia to successfully mask its true desired endstate. By doing so, it allowed for almost any action to potentially be considered a successful mission to enemies and outside observers, due to a lack of understanding of Russian intentions. This also allowed for unchallenged Russian saber rattling and threats against the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the West as Russia attempted to paint Western Europe and the United States as weak, especially in the eyes of developing nations. In addition to actions on the ground in Ukraine, Russia integrated and utilized television, print media, and social media to deflect and hide its efforts at occupation and annexation while reducing potential Western involvement.16 The successful use of IW allowed Russian forces to occupy eastern Ukraine and annex Crimea without a large-scale response from the West. As the world continues to move into the information age, the ability of nation-state and nonstate actors to employ successful IO tactics into their overall strategy will undoubtedly increase. To successfully deter and respond to these threats, the United States must innovate and develop organizations with expertise in both preventing and conducting such actions. Russia’s IW campaign in Ukraine enabled it to achieve the objective of annexing Crimea, but it was not a flawless strategy. One flaw was the effort that Russian leaders took to deny the existence of troops in Ukraine. Even after undeniable proof, including geo-tagged photographs on social media and captured Russian troops inside Ukrainian territory, Russian President Vladimir Putin continued to deny involvement. These excessive and continual denials served only to discredit Russian leaders and provide additional reason to believe that Russian forces were in fact operating inside Ukraine.17 In addition, the lack of an overwhelming campaign of offensive cyber actions brings into question the overarching hybrid warfare campaign. Russia is arguably one of the most capable nation-state cyber actors.18 The lack of a comprehensive offensive cyber campaign, such as that observed in Estonia in 2007 and Georgia in 2008, raises questions about Russian IW and Reflexive Control strategy. While this may indicate a desire not to aggravate potential adversaries, it may also indicate Russia’s inability to control all aspects of its offensive cyber actions such that it was concerned that actions could produce large-scale unintended consequences.19 These consequences may have resulted in the Russians’ inability to deny their involvement, or brought powerful enemies into the conflict. As discussed, the flaws noted in Reflexive Control doctrine serve as examples of how difficult it is currently, and will be in the future, to control the consequences of offensive actions and conduct information warfare in an information age. In an effort to better understand the capabilities and intentions of potential adversaries, understand their lessons learned, and use them to our advantage, the U.S. Government must ensure that the current organization of IW capabilities and strategic planning enables an integrated and cohesive National Security Strategy. Strategic Planning Guidance to Tactical Execution? In the joint planning process, IO planning is typically a supporting effort. If we prescribe to the idea that all wars are fought on the cognitive plane, at least at some point, then it is logical to assume that, at one point or another, IW courses of action (COAs) should be the supported effort. Moreover, “information operations support themes” are sometimes developed after military kinetic COAs are.20 While the current planning process and traditional planning structure provide the formal links between national strategy and the tactical level, they do not prescribe a way in which to gain the information advantage in future conflicts. Arguably, from a national perspective, an information strategy should drive subsequent actions and be integrated from the President to the individual Servicemember. The information strategy should be integrated with strategic communications efforts of the U.S. Government. However, as noted in the 2008 report from the Defense Science Board, “Strategic Communications is a dynamic process with responsibility held by those at the highest levels of government—the President and senior government leaders. . . . But to do so requires a commitment not yet seen, though some steps have been taken.”21 In fact, the report recommends the creation of a nonprofit, nonpartisan Center for Global Engagement as a focal point for strategic communication activities. In 2010, Joseph Biden provided the President a report on strategic communications that urged synchronization and defined the overall concept.22 An interagency policy committee, led by the National Security staff, was a recommended solution; however, a committee is made up of individuals with allegiances to their own organization and likely with other responsibilities, not fully being dedicated to integrated strategic communications. The little IW capability that exists is based on the current and legacy organizational structure, which hinders effective IO planning and execution. If information space can be considered a way and means to fight and win wars, then a framework is required to assist in prioritization and planning and to present ends that may be achieved through information warfare. Planners must articulate why a specific action is being taken and when it should occur based on commander’s intent, the operational environment, and the operational approach designed to solve the problem. Decades of trial and error in warfare have led to institutional doctrine and rule sets. While there is an argument that these rules should be applied to both kinetic and nonkinetic effects, it is important to realize that there are certain unique factors associated with both. For example, targeting fundamentals are largely agreed upon and accepted for offensive force-on-force operations, but do the theories of targeting need to adjust for information warfare? Some argue that the center of gravity (COG) for the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) is the Internet. If we accept this idea, how does the United States target ISIL? Does the U.S. Government shut down Internet Service Providers (ISPs) (that is, the target) that ISIL is using? Does the government conduct a distributed denial-of-service attack against certain Web sites? Does it put influential messages onto ISIL message boards on the Internet? All options are plausible, but many times are not executed due to lengthy and unsynchronized plans. The lack of leadership and a focal point in the U.S. Government who can articulate the second- and third-order effects of information operations often contributes to a lack of action. The ability to understand how the information space will be influenced by the outcome of a U.S. action is not effective because there is no lead organization. In addition to the tactical-level information effects, how are strategic communications vetted and targeted? Do the processes differ or are they the same? If the view of this process were to change, and targeting were to become a process within which information targets are held at risk (for example, the ISP example or building a strategic weapon to deter an enemy), then it is possible that realistic options could be presented to a combatant commander in a crisis action scenario. To execute a concept where the United States holds information targets at risk, it must have access to the target. Access for information-related effects delivered through the information space is no different than for physical effects delivered by airplanes or ships. The delivery method could be news, a cyber capability, a military action, or even a comment by the President. The path to employ information-related capabilities (IRCs) requires access from the sender to the receiver, and that targeting path must be sustainable. Without sustained access, a target cannot be held at risk because gaining access to the receiver could take an extended amount of time, with relation to the operation. Additionally, the capability must be attainable. Software development can be a potential strategic advantage. Driving education and training for software development down to the tactical level empowers young Servicemembers to create capabilities linked to the target, reduce cost, and create efficiencies. For example, a Soldier is taught how to use a rifle, the foundations are built in training, and he is able to utilize the weapon through the employment of various tactics, techniques, and procedures on the battlefield as the situation dictates. If the situation changes, he adjusts to the enemy in an instant. From an IW perspective, software is but one tool, as is the rifle. Foundations are built, skills are honed, but it is left to the tactical level to ensure the capability is “tuned” to the target because the tactical-level operator should have the most accurate knowledge of that target. Additionally, as accesses change, the tactical and operational level should ensure consistent and reliable access to the target. Indeed, the Soldier does not develop the strategy; the national security staff, President, and combatant commanders do. But what organization is responsible for coordinating the strategic message throughout the national security apparatus? Furthermore, what organization is responsible for providing information operation COAs for the President, specifically designed as an end? The contrarian viewpoint to the idea of driving development down to the operator level (that is, the Soldier) is that authorities do not come with capability. This is true. A tactical-level unit should not have authority to execute operations in the information space, just as the Soldier with the rifle would not fire without orders. There should be a strategy with clear and precise guidance for operational and tactical targeting. This does not require “execution authorities,” but it does require guidance from national-level leadership on the issue. In other words, because technical acumen is required, the U.S. Government cannot afford to have a disjointed IW strategy in which progress is slowed due to an overly complicated and bureaucratic hierarchical structure. A lack of unity of effort results, and risk to mission and risk to force increase. Developers, operators, and analysts need flexibility and agility to solve problems quickly with innovative technology and an understanding of the information age, just as a Soldier does when in battle. Is the World Organizationally Changing? Military organizations have generally followed hierarchical models as early as the Greeks in 400 BCE for organizing and equipping. It is possible that global IT trends will require a foundationally different way of thinking and organizing IRCs in the U.S. Government to maintain pace with the speed of information. Largely, from the time of the Greeks to that of the current U.S. Government, militaries have been designed around a hierarchical system. As IW becomes increasingly more important during the conduct of government or military operations, a lattice framework and system may be a logical way to organize information warfare–based capabilities and personnel. This concept prescribes basic guidance and a certain rule set (that is, authorities) but empowers individual members to develop solutions unabated by personnel unfamiliar with the technical situation. The concept capitalizes on meritocracy-based principles and focuses on a federated approach as well as crowd-sourcing solutions internally to the military, or even in the public sector, to arrive at solutions. Within the U.S. Government, it is unlikely that a lattice organization would be wholly integrated; however, a hybrid concept that captures the value of a legal and hierarchical framework along with realizing the potential benefit of a lattice organization would be valuable, as globalization and IT increasingly integrate our world. Additionally, a lattice framework would more closely align conceptually with the mass-network IT environment in which we live. Ideas presented in the corporate world are potential solutions that can be used or modified for complicated IW concepts within the U.S. Government. In a thought piece from business, Cathleen Benko and Molly Anderson from Forbes magazine highlight a few key benefits of a lattice organizational structure: With employees working in geographically dispersed teams, the old ways of communicating [are] no longer served. Lattice ways to participate moved the organization toward more interactive, transparent communication. In one instance, the finance division gave a role traditionally reserved for management—identifying improvement priorities—to employees, by launching a “pain points” portal where they can voice their views of current challenges for everyone to see. The company appoints teams to address the highest priorities. At Deloitte, our annual employee survey shows that 90% of workers who experience all three lattice ways are engaged. Contrast that with the results of a major global workforce study by Towers Perrin in 2007–2008 that found just over 60% of employees in surveyed companies were engaged.23 Not only does a lattice framework promote internal integration and idea-sharing, the concept also promotes the use of solutions from external sources. In many cases, members of a lattice-type organization are encouraged to look for nonstandard solutions to difficult problems, even if that means branching outside of organizational norms. Analyzing a recent case, the iPhone encryption issue surrounding the San Bernardino terrorist attack is an example of a federated approach to problem-solving. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) was able to crack the iPhone’s encryption, despite Apple’s unwillingness to support. Apple’s fear stemmed from the idea that if it provided the requested support, the government would then own the key to all encryption security measures for iPhones around the world.24 When the international media reported and publically debated the issue, the FBI received calls from individuals and companies claiming to possess the tools necessary to break the encryption. In fact, one company was able to break the encryption and allowed the FBI to retrieve the desired data from the terrorist’s phone. This example shows the power of information in multiple ways; the first is the fact that the government was unable to use traditional methods of gaining support from a private company. Second, media, as the primary driver, brought attention to the problem and forced a public debate, which worked in favor of the government. There were arguments on both sides of the issue, but it should be assumed that the challenge in and of itself was enough to stimulate a solution, whether right or wrong. The key point to this example is that the proliferation of information drove a solution, regardless of Apple’s standpoint, the FBI’s authority, and even despite popular public opinion for or against the FBI. If the power of information can easily dictate the outcome of such an example, what are the long-term implications for warfare? The U.S. Government can take measures now, organizationally, to harness IW concepts and be positioned to maintain the information advantage in a dynamic and unsure information age. Future IW solutions will also need to involve multidomain skills from individuals with varying backgrounds. In today’s military, once a Servicemember is branded with a specific skill set, it is challenging to break from that community and maneuver effectively between communities, while still maintaining upward mobility. To achieve greater effectiveness in IO planning and execution, cross-domain and diverse IRC careers should become a desired career path option for future leaders. Amazon Meets the U.S. Government To harness the information age and enable IW capability toward the success of future U.S. conflicts, a new organization should be created within the U.S. Government. The Cold War has passed, and so has USIA; however, it is possible that a new version of USIA is required as Russia continues to test its limits of power. As in the case of Ukraine, Georgia, and Estonia, as well as the need to combat terrorist groups such as ISIL, a renewed effort on U.S. information warfare is required. The dynamic and ever-changing environment requires a fundamentally different organizational structure than that of current government hierarchical structures in order to be flexible and adaptable for 21st-century problems. Additionally, as we move forward in the information age, our lives will be increasingly intertwined and connected with information systems. This information environment will continue to play a critical role in how the U.S. Government and military interact with allies, partners, and adversaries in all of the operational domains. To shape the environment to meet our desired endstates, we must recognize the importance of information warfare and work to ensure that IO concepts are properly integrated into all actions and operations, if not become an end themselves. We must also search for innovative ways to build and employ IO concepts. Our IO experts must have the required training and expertise necessary to meet these requirements by way of strategic guidance. Operators must have flexibility and agility engrained into their ethos through a lattice-type organizational structure, which honors a multidomain career path. The ability to carry out all IW requirements must be done in a timely and succinct manner that allows for the fastest possible action with the most flexibility. If we are not able to achieve these objectives, we will most definitely fall behind in the fast-paced and constantly changing world of IT and IW, and we will likely be ineffective in identifying and combating enemy COGs, such as ISIL’s reliance on IT. It is time to implement ideas that exist in industry, and force change, before change is unattainable—through a sustainable and repeatable process and organization within the U.S. Government. *About the authors: Major William R.

Even with multi-user support, Google Home can't create reminders or calendar appointments Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/04/20 1:39pm PDTApr 20, 2017 31 Plus 1 on G+ 20 Share on Facebook 40 Share on Twitter Total Shares91 Google Google Home News Videos Google announced multi-user support for Google Home earlier today, but it's only launching in the US right now. This is finally a chance for Google to rectify things and add all those features Home was lacking at launch, and indeed Google has included a few new features. We're still missing some big ones, though. You still cannot create a reminder or add events to your calendar. After going through the setup process for multi-user, Google Home has access to some of your personal account information. That allows you to ask questions about what's on your calendar, view photos tied to your Google Photos account, and so on. However, writing data to your account appears to be a sticking point. If you try to create a reminder or a calendar appointment, Home tells you it can't do that yet, just like it did before. Hopefully the addition of multi-user support will let Google add these very basic features soon. Seriously, adding something to your calendar has to be one of the most common tasks for a human assistant. It's certainly not impossible to do this stuff, either. Assistant on the phone can create reminders and events just fine. Tags Google google assistant google home video subscribe ...

I'll make millions (of reminders)! Good_Ole_Pinocchio Google can't even handle the basics of their own services here.....SAD! lzdking Make Google Great Again! #MGGA mark555055d Such a disappointment. Google better start ramping up the functions on this thing or it will fail. Also, if they do something stupid like releasing a Google home 2 anytime soon, the shit will fly. LondonLeedsFan I thought about Google Home 2 about 3 days after buying this one and realising it doesn't do so much... I can't help but think it's going to happen. mark555055d Yeah... i could totally see them doing something stupid like making a GH2, with bluetooth pairing capability, improving the mics and speaker, charging $30 more for it, and then giving it an "exclusive" software version that allows reminders and calendar support, all while leaving the GH1 back for months due to "hardware differences". LondonLeedsFan IMO something like this should not be on a 1 or 2 year upgrade cycle. If that's how it goes, I'll leave it! Pete Still no assistant on my Nexus 5X in the UK! LondonLeedsFan Have you set phone language to English US and got latest play services? That will basically push it to your phone within 5 minutes. Pete Latest Play Services (even gone for the beta), same with Google app. As for language, tried that & it didn't work, but why should I? They say it's available in the UK and various other manufacturers (Samsung, OnePlus etc) have made it available on theirs, but Google haven't rolled it out to Nexus devices over here yet. A farce. LondonLeedsFan I have a 6P in the UK and I've had it for about 6 weeks now. Strange. Roderick Gadellaa I don't have it on my Moto X 2014 either and I updated the Google app, Play Services and even edited the build.prop. Somehow it's not working for everyone yet. That said, on the Moto X it may be Moto Voice that's the problem because it also prevents Ok Google hotword detection from anywhere but the Google app itself - it doesn't even work in Google Now On Tap although the searchbar says "Say OK Google". Leonardo Baez create reminder to bitch about you. :,D brian. Careful, she'll turn that insult on you... sbeaulieu The biggest problem assistant got is support. Only one country(officialy). dcdttu Gotta have one before the other, maybe. So that's what they hopefully are going to do next. pfmiller Once you can distinguish between users that's all you should need for both reading and writing appointments. I'm wondering if they are not fully confident in the reliability of the multiple user recognition, so they figure implementing read-only functions is safer while they work on getting the reliability up. denisu So, am I right in saying it can only make calendar disappointments? elchuby Can't even do that. Crystalatracy Managing director of Google!, is explaining to users to start off "Work at home" method, that People have been doing for about one year now. These days alone, I generated close to $36,000 until now with no more than my home computer as well as some spare time, despite that i have a fulltime 9 to 5 job.

I'm more excited to find out how they intend to handle messaging, though. surethom I'm sorry but why can Google not do the most simplest things. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Because they're a bunch of overpaid prima donnas who think they're geniuses but can't even match what a simple diligent grunt coder can do. M6 Over 90% of those grunt coders you mention probably couldn't write a simple service that serves a 'hello world' webpage at the thousands of QPS that Google's least popular services have to handle. Most of the work done to spin up such a service are done by SREs not SWEs. This is why start ups can add features so quickly. They simply don't have that many users and can worry about scalability after they get popular, and they have months if not years to work out a scalable solution in the meantime. Also, most grunt coders that add features quickly end up accumulating vast amounts of technical debt in the code they write. Morten Ulv Readers of Android Police are highly trained in pitchforking and kneejerk reactions. No critical thought allowed here, get out! abqnm If I hired an assistant and he or she couldn't add appointments to my calendar, I'd fire that motherfucker on the spot. I guess it must be time to get jobs at Google. Because they sure as shit don't know what an assistant is or what they are supposed to be able to do. Morten Ulv I'm sure they are not aware of the problem and that you would totally be fix it in 5 minutes. That's how it is, I'm sure! Lateef Alabi-Oki I'm just glad that the multiuser support works as well as it does. It hasn't failed in distinguishing the voices in my household. My spouse told it to show pictures from Google Photos and it executed. It's truly magical. Forgive my honeymoon phase. I'll be back to bitching in a day or two. makapav The next thing Google needs to enable us family sharing of all pictures and albums instead of doing it one by one. mustbepbs Still can't even add time to an existing fucking timer. Seriously, this company has the weirdest priorities. makapav Stickers FTW! Duder12 Google literally just tackled the biggest hurdle. Its all game over from here on out for the competition. bozzykid Considering you can hardly do anything with the multi-user support, it isn't even clear if it truly works. Martin Still don't get the point of this trash... If it can't make a simple reminder or cal app... What for people use it? Weather? Time? When you are surrounded or 10 more gadgets doing the same (watch, phone, tv, Pc and many more)... This is why I am never too exited when Google releases something new, it's never good, not even close to what they promise it is going to be... :) Matt Terk I have 3 devices, whole home music is wonderful along with all the assistant functions and control of all my smarthome devices. It would be hard to live without it now. boop It's the cheapest cast-enabled speaker I know of and it works fantastically. The voice commands for pulling up music are also best-in-class. I have a few smart home devices as well and virtually any combination of words construable as a command mumbled from anywhere in the room will do what I want. I doesn't do everything it ought to but it does quite a lot and does it exceptionally well. jdrch Google Home: a solution in desperate search of a problem. Deeco AP is the biggest Android media site, please make articles about all the short comings of Google and shame them until we are heard. Too much crap going on itsatrap Why people buy this thing?

Some Pixel phones are having problems with backups, Google is looking into it Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/04/20 10:35am PDTApr 20, 2017 22 Plus 1 on G+ 14 Share on Facebook 42 Share on Twitter Total Shares78 Bug Watch Google News Pixel Pixel XL Some users have been experiencing issues with backup on Google's Pixel devices, most notably backups of SMS, call history, and apps, although other accounts of all backup types failing have also been reported.  The current cause isn't known, but reports of the problem on Google's product forums stretch back to just after the launch of the device, and for many the matter remains unresolved. Even one of Google's support specialists discovered he was experiencing the issue, but apart from reaching out to those affected for bug reports no information has been publicly provided. To be clear, for those with the problem their personal data in one or more categories may not be being backed up as they would expect. Not to be alarmist, but with this backup error occurring silently, it might be prudent for Pixel users to check that their devices are, in fact, performing their backups as expected and intended. To check for yourself, navigate to Settings, Backup and Reset, Backup and see if any of the items listed under Content are "Waiting to backup." If you are among those suffering the problem you might want to exercise some caution and consider another backup method for whatever might be failing for you. Also, feel free to add your voices (and log-files) down at Google's product forums. They're currently reaching out to those affected there for additional information, and with more data the issue can probably be fixed that much more quickly.

Gustavo Me too, also only seeing it in Call History on my Pixel teh Jax At least the important ones are working fine! Andrew same here Ryne Hager That's not a huge deal, then. Not the worst thing to lose if your phone eats it. Photos or SMS could be a bigger problem, though. teh Jax Right. If somebody is experiencing this bug with other pieces of data, this is a big deal! If this is all it is, hardly anybody is going to care. And those that do care probably should be using multiple forms of backup anyway. Sachin Bahal Same here Suicide_Note Same. That's the only one that had any issue on my device. steb0ne Same here... So most people in this comment section who actually have Pixel devices seem to be having the same issue with the call history not backing up and a bunch of trolling by other people talking about how it's plagued with bugs, lol! Got it! I wonder how long it's been acting up... Everything else shows backed up this morning. If this is a daily backup and it didn't backup one day is this really that big of a deal? The screenshot posted shows December... I'm curious to know is this a Google feature or Pixel feature? Can someone else with a phone running Nougat confirm if theirs is backing up? teh Jax Definitely a lot of trolling and ignorance going on in these comments. That's pretty typical by people commenting about a premium device that they either can't buy or chose not to buy - it helps them justify their situation. Which is fine by me. It's rare that comments are actually insightful. ¯_(ツ)_/¯ teddyfrozevelt Mine hasn't backed up since I factory reset it in december. Everything else has backed up. Impulse_Vigil It's an Android feature, has been forever, but O and the Pixel are the first places where it's status has been exposed and broken down by category. So it may or may not be working elsewhere, you wouldn't really know. Now freak out! Heh... steb0ne That's what I thought... So it's possibly happening on other non Pixel devices. The article made it seem Pixel specific CJ Me too. Maxr1998 Same for me, Nexus 6P, O Preview. Also had that issue for SMS & apps after I clean-flashed the update, but I could at least fix the latter by manually running "bmgr backupnow --all" in a su shell. SMS somehow resolved itself it seems. Impulse_Vigil Same, everything else is backed up, didn't even know call history could be backed up. 4Ui812 Better call Saul. Bat Man 1 day = 1 problem? 4Ui812 Nausea, heartburn, indigestion, upset stomach, diarrhea.... Google's quality control is hard at work. Middlefinger Yeah, but at least it gets 'Timely updates' /s Phalkon30 Just bought my 6p 2 weeks ago, not a single thing moved to it from my previous device. It's like I never had a Google history, even though I have app backups on my Google Drive. I even tried to to set up from another device, it gave an unknown error and moved nothing I'm going to have to root to fix it, awful backup solution sproc I think it only works with the same phone honestly, cause otherwise I bet no one uses it sadly. Tiuri Elvander Sent in my 6p for an RMA, it was fully backed up. Tried to restore the backup on my replacement 6p but it only offered my One plus One (which I used while I was waiting for my replacement). The whole thing lasted less than a week, yet my original backup was not available as an option to restore. Very annoying!! Jordan VanCampen Same here. My work phone which is a Moto z play stopped working. I got a replacement and thought that I'd be able restore it from the previous one, but nope. The setup process only gave me the option to restore from my Vizio tablet that came with my TV that I recently bought. My pixel that is my personal phone wasn't an option. So I decided that I would use the NFC option. So I I did that with my pixel and it didn't restore anything at all. The backup situation on Android is still pretty much a dumpster fire. Ryne Hager I've had the restore from previous device thing bug out as well, I usually just set everything up as a new device now. blindexecutioner $800 device running never-ending beta software. Jingwei Zhang It does backup a lot of settings for many apps. As for games, if the game requires logging in, it backs up the log in information if you had it set as memorized. It also memorizes the layout of the apps. The backup is definitely not the best, but it's automatic and much more comprehensive than the native backup other manufacturers provide, including ios. Roy Hm, no. I used an iphone and ipod touch ages ago and they actually have a backup solution that works. When you restore, it's like you never left - even between devices. Even Blackberry had a better backup system than Android ever has - the only decent backup solution Android has is Titanium backup (which is, to be fair, excellent), and that requires root so most people are SOL. I've never even had my wifi settings restored properly, even though that's supposedly backed up. Jingwei Zhang Hm, no. We have six iPhones in the family and none of them backup like you said here (like you never left). However, my Nexus to Pixel transfer was like that. All apps, photos, sms and etc were restored to the same position and most pertinent settings were restored. IIRC, the phone even restored my company's WIFI setting with the correct credential. I don't know which android phone you have, but Google's backup does some pretty amazing things for requiring absolutely no maintenance on the user's side. EDIT: I just remembered. My sister and mom actually use Google Photo on their iPhone 6S/7 because it's free and easy as opposed to the tiny iCloud storage. JohnyNoLegs Its free when it compresses your photos. Also iPhone does whole phone backup, android does not. Also if you lose your pixel right now, you are screwed, as you can't do a transfer. Jingwei Zhang IIRC Pixel has full photo backup without any compression. I believe I specifically said that it does some amazing things with absolutely no user side maintenance. You can always do a manual full backup with titanium or in recovery. Root and unlocked bootloader are needed, but that's just takes a few minutes with Nexus and Pixel. How is that? Everything is automatically backed up including video, pic and sms, call history and etc on a daily basis. I would wager that you can retrieve more current information from a lost Pixel/Nexus than from a lost iPhone if they were both lost and went completely off the grid. JohnyNoLegs Wager away, then send me the money. iPhone does a bit for bit backup, it backs up the current state of the whole iPhone. Google does not do this. Google selectively backs up items like call history, sms etc. Pixel is the only Android phone that offers uncompressed backup for free, not really an option for everyone mate. Titanium backup is for ROOT LOLOLOLOL. Recovery is for unlocked devices LOLOLOLOLOL iPhone does complete backup with any hacking required, talk about no user side maintenance! BTW, my Pixel stopped backup up photos, it's a bug. Doesn't sound like no user maintenance required haha Jingwei Zhang hmm comparing full backup that can take upwards of an hour to one that runs in the background huh? You definitely understand what no user maintenance is and are certainly brilliant. Comparing apple to orange as long as it suits your narrative. Are we talking about any other android phone? I don't think so. Unlocking bootloader and granting root access are considered hacking now? Bugs and failures happen, just like how two of our iPhone 6 bricked just out of warranty. Also, my Pixel is not experiencing this bug, so it's not a problem for me (yet). JohnyNoLegs Think logically for a second mate. You are talking a out no user maintenance. IPhone does full backups while you sleep. Android does not. To root your phone and unlock the bootloader requires user maintenance. Impulse_Vigil I do think iOS backup functionality is more comprehensive, it doesn't leave things up to individual devs either... OTOH it does gobble up a pretty decent amount of storage on accounts where people often end up having to pay extra for... Nothing is perfect. JohnyNoLegs It's true, but for the person who just wants their stuff backed up, IOS has it covered much better than android. Even the simplicity of setting up iCloud to do everything is great. In Android it is a bit all over the shop in deep settings and different apps. I'm fine with Androids implementation, but then again I don't care about doing factory resets etc which is kinda the nature of android. iPhone users perhaps are less used to having to restore their data all the time. Ryne Hager I think it backs up some appdata, like Netflix login information carrying over to new devices, that sort of thing. JohnyNoLegs After an RMA and a few factory resets, I can tell you it hasn't in my case. Impulse_Vigil It can do that, but apps need to be written for it, backup has always been a joke on Android but it's largely because devs ignore the existing tools tbh. Killa I'm not seeing any option on my Nexus 6 in the Backup & Reset area that shows the breakout of the different backup content like it does in the image above. There's just the On/Off switch and language that says backups are in Google Drive...etc. Is this only a Pixel thing or higher version of Android? Phalkon30 Must be a pixel thing, I don't see it on my 6P either, and I'm on 7.1.2 Cyan Thayn It's also an O thing apparently, have the exact menu shown in the screenshots on my 6P on the O preview (and have the same bugs as well!). Ryne Hager It's a pixel thing, no need to worry. Impulse_Vigil I'm not even sure what the point is, I guess extra info and transparency (which is good), because none of those options really do anything but tell you what's being backed up. There's nothing to toggle besides the main backup option and the option to backup to Drive. Shoot, other phones could be suffering the same issues but because the backup status isn't displayed nobody would know! On my Pixel everything but call history is up to date, and I couldn't care less about that. Ishimaru Another day, another Pixel issue. Ramon Google is fucking up a lot lately. What's taking so long to fire some people? Just not just lately Conrad Okay, so what happened to the review of the Synology 416play? I'd really like to read it! lomsha Some premium device lol. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Once again, I told you so. You should really run a daily series called "Google Screwup Of The Day". Ryne Hager Your name is amazing. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Not many people get it. ;) J.J. Pixel and problem are two words heard often lately! Leif Sikorski Same with previous Nexus and some other Google Hardware devices. It's one reason why I'm glad that other OEMs update slower these days. Google keeps giving me the impression that they still see their devices as geeky developer devices where the user does the final testing. If they want to be more serious with their hardware efforts and compete with the big brands they need to invest much more money into testing and customer support. Ryne Hager Eh, bugs happen with any tech, and the volume of problems has gotten a lot smaller than things used to be back in the day. Progress has its pitfalls, is all. Nick I'm with you here. I get that people expect nothing but excellence from a device that they paid a pretty penny for, but stuff happens sometimes and so far it hasn't been anything that warrants the level of indignation I am seeing here in the comment section. I'm sure Google will fix the issue as soon as they possibly can. JohnyNoLegs And by progress, you mean they haven't really done anything different right? Still the same updates with bugs, still take ages to fix anything. I am still having the worst bluetooth experience of any phone I have owned, and that's after an RMA already! Anon Now we know why the pixel includes 24/7 support. Lisarbeams Managing director of Google!, is explaining to users to start off "Work at home" method, that People have been doing for about one year now.

Let's see what the bug list for the S8 looks like six months down the line! Phil We're already on a pink screen and what's it been? 2 weeks? I've not heard any reports of exploding Pixels so far at least. Most of the people trolling these articles are Sammy Knights who should know better. I'm looking forward to seeing what problems the S8 has over the next 6 months. By the way, is Bixby's working yet? Mike Bastable The Pixel handsets seen to be agreeing poorly... Lot of bugs recently... Sachin Bahal no device will ever be perfect, there will always be some issue(s) during a device's life cycle, and it just so happens that the Pixel's issues/bugs are happening 6 months into the phone's life cycle Ryne Hager Yeah, I expect they'll probably get things fixed. Bugs happen. Sachin Bahal The Pixel is just crawling with bugs ;) Hussain Ahmadi And some go on to call this crap as best Android phone? A big joke and Google has made a really big joke of itself by releasing this iAndroid phone!! Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ The Pixel is STILL listed as the Best Android Phone on most sites, despite all the problems, the halos in the pictures, etc. Even though I NEVER thought it deserved that status, I can understand that most of its problems surfaced after web magazines rated it. But it's clear now that the phone sucks and its software sucks. If publishing had any integrity, they'd issue a correction, revoke that title and make some other phone the best phone of 2016. Impulse_Vigil Or most of the problems aren't really as wide spread as some seem to believe, I've had pretty much no issues with mine. Marty I had a Google backup issue on my OP3T. I factory wiped it after an update and the restore function usually seen during set up didn't appear. YaKillaCJ Something about that picture just bugs me... Impulse_Vigil I see what you did there! Have a ^ Arcest Not new adb restore failed to re-install apk https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/37130390 Sir_Brizz Compromise free device. Actually getting tired of making this joke, which says something. Impulse_Vigil Compromise and bug free since Nov here. /shrug New_Guy Geez, they Pixel has so many issues, it's crazy... Phil This problem is only being reported by people enrolled on the beta testing of Android O ffs. Of course there are going to be bugs with am OS still in the testing stage. That's the whole point isn't it? Give people an early look in order that they can identify bugs and instabilities? The problem is not the phone, it a Dev version of an OS. Kevin Sword Loving your hero images Ryne! Mr.Bean ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ We're gonna need a can of Raid to squash these bugs. Muzaffar Don't mind the bugs, as long as it get stock android and latest update. ashjas Are these options only pixel specific..? I mean I don't see such backup options on my Nexus 4 with nougut custom rom? Impulse_Vigil Call history is waiting to be backed up here weird, everything else is current. I didn't even know my phone backed up call history tbh... Seems I've gotten ultra lucky with Pixel bugs, outside a handful of sporadic instances of Bluetooth turning off thru the start of the year I've avoided just about everything else. Got mine in November FWIW, tap on wood. Bala Same here since day one for SMS and call history ,it's funny when they say they are looking into. A feature that's supposed to work with final release is not working for a while and still they are looking Jan Machovec Is this something Pixel specific? Because I don't see any option to backup SMS, Call log and others on my SGS7.

WSJ: Google planning to block bad ads in Chrome on desktop and mobile Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/04/19 6:31pm PDTApr 19, 2017 67 Plus 1 on G+ 132 Share on Facebook 74 Share on Twitter Total Shares273 Google News Rumors Advertising is very much a balancing act for websites these days. You want to make enough money from an ad-supported site to cover costs, but you don't want to annoy users to the point they block all your ads. Some websites don't seem to care how much they annoy you, though. Google is reportedly getting ready to take a stand against the worst ads on the web with a built in ad-blocker for Chrome. According to the Wall Street Journal, Google's ad-blocking feature could be turned on by default in the desktop and mobile versions of Chrome. It would filter out only the ads Google deems unacceptable. That would cover things like pop-ups, auto-playing video ads, and “prestitial” ads with countdown timers. Google may even build the feature such that it blocks all the ads on a site that serves one of these unacceptable ads. That would nudge website operators to get all their ads in order—after all, Chrome is a huge chunk of usage. Google has not commented on the Wall Street Journal's story, probably because it's still trying to figure out how to pitch the ad blocker (if it's real). This could be seen as an attempt to coerce website operators to only run Google's AdSense ads, which are guaranteed not to run afoul of Google's blocking policies. It's a risky direction for an advertising powerhouse like Google to go, but it might not see a better way to deal with the prevalence of ad-blocking.

AbbyZFresh What did WSJ do to you? Nathan J What did they do for you? The Wall Street Journal is owned by Rupert Murdoch's News Corp, which runs the propaganda arm of the Republican party in the US, better known as Fox News. Murdoch's interference in politics and opposition to freedom isn't limited to the US. I don't recall the details, but the EU or UK was about to kick him out for starting trouble over there a year or two ago. I'm not real big on politics, but I think a certain distrust of News Corp, to a point, is healthy and should not really be questioned. Cakefish You might be referring to News of The World - a British tabloid newspaper run by Rupert Murdoch that was closed down a few years ago because it was found to have spied on people's phones. This included hacking the phone of a murdered teenager and soldiers who had died in combat. It caused a massive uproar. ZettabyteGamer Spread a lot of false information about YouTubers, and YouTube as a platform. They focus on clicks, and getting subscribers instead of accurate information reporting. givitumibeybi WSJ is a wannabe BuzzFeed newspaper. Trooper311 Awesome. Josh Crumley Good. Those ones where you load a page and start reading then suddenly disappears and a fullscreen ad with a 5 "second" timer starts going that takes about 5 seconds *per* second...ugh (looking at you gawker media). I just hope they don't automatically assume all google ad placements are ok just because they're google ads. DozensOfUs If you read gawker sites, it means you're a liberal weenie and deserve to be annoyed. Josh Crumley It was a kotaku article about zelda breath of the wild... 😆😄 https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/d88dd0554cbbcfbefae945805e94ca40e0596a9a2abfb8beb5f9b9b849ce1225.gif Martin The one that are making Sound and are pretty much impossible to close need to be first!!! (You won an iPhone - beeeeeeeeeeeeeep beeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeep beeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeep)... :) DragoCubed The vibrations! MJ Cool I guess but I recommend everyone just get a real ad blocker like uBlock Origin and be done with it. RyRyTheFunBun I begrudgingly use Dolphin on all my Android devices for the ad blocker. Their are better, but dolphin renders almost all sites correctly and is fast. freshprince_87 Chrome is better D.Smithee Are you kidding me? You're using that shitty adblocker add-on for Dolphin? That extension hasn't been updated in years. Just use Brave Browser for Android--it's essentially Chrome with adblocking, tracker blocking, HTTPS and fingerprinting protection with a few added necessities. Nathan J On mobile, just run a system-wide ad blocker. AdGuard on Android and AdBlock on iOS. Chrome works just fine with no ads seen anywhere. MJ Nothing wrong with Adguard but installing a whole app seems overkill when an browser add-on will do. I really have no interest in using Chrome on mobile. ZettabyteGamer What mobile browser do you use, our of curiosity? My1 well because if you do things like adaway and whatnot all the apps' ads will be kicked right into oblivion and not just the browser's ones. also when you have root, you can let the adblocker just play with the hosts file and let the networking layer do its thing. MJ I just need an ad blocker for the browser. I normally don't install programs that don't let you pay to remove ads. Root is a go since I use Android Pay. Finding it weird I have now had a half dozen replies giving me suggestions and "solutions" yet I didn't express having any problem... My1 well I dunno how secure android pay is but unless there is a chip similar to a smartcard or apple's secure enclave in the phone which stores all the needed data, it can be copied, effectively killing everything. I like my banking card with chip which is pretty much exactly a smart card meaning you cant read out any data without essentially destroying the card itself, and if made properly, the data will destroy itself when tampering happens. MJ I don't know where you live but in the US the smart chip on cards as been a disaster. This is the procedure to do a transaction... 1. Look at machine and wonder if the smart card reader is active? Is there a sign? Will the clerk tell me? No? Ask or guess... 2. The smartcard reader is active so now have to choose 1-3 options with buttons than wait 5-10 seconds for the transaction to be done. 3. Be startled by the annoying sound many terminals make like there was a error but it just means remove your card. Security? The magnetic stripe is still there! The procedure for a wireless transaction... 1. Look for the wireless/Android Pay symbol. Hold phone up to terminal and a second later transaction is done. Security? I know it uses end-to-end encryption for transactions. What will copy what and how? Carsten AdGuard is not for your browser, but for your whole system. So, "Free with ads" becomes basically free, for example ;) Nathan J Or "free with a white space taken out from where the ad was." Some ad blockers on the computer (or most now, maybe) can also remove the space, but we're not there yet on phones. Of course, you shouldn't use an ad blocker to rip off app developers. Buy the ad-free version. The only one I'm not doing that for is the weather apps. Most of them won't let you just buy an ad free version. They'll let you take the ads off for a year, but then they come back and/or they charge you again. Pretty greedy! Of course, there are pay-once weather apps, but the popular ones (Weather Channel, Weather Underground) only have the subscription. (I really need to just suck it up and get Dark Sky...) Carsten Well, we are - in most apps I don't get empty spaces. In Chrome definitely not, AdGuard uses some stuff (I don't know how) to remove the spaces entirely. Also: you can get lifetime licenses ;) For details, see this. They have written about such things just a few days ago: https://blog.adguard.com/en/adguard-vs-adaway-dns66/ Cakefish BBC Weather app. Free with no ads. Nathan J Android only? UK only perhaps? BBC is great but often they limit things to people who pay their fees — which is completely understandable. But when the Boston Marathon bombing happened, I went straight to the Beeb for coverage, online, in the US, and it was pretty great. Live video coverage, live tweets from their people (I guess), and a summary of what went down. They're the best. Cakefish Android and iOS. I checked on the website and apparently it's only available to download in the UK. That's a shame as it's a great app but understandable. Nathan J That's a pretty arbitrary limitation, and why I got a 128GB phone. Probably more than I need, but I've used more than a 64GB phone will hold. I don't know about Adguard on Android, but AdBlock on iPhone uses 16.9MB of space. That's with its filters. The app and its data and cache. And apps are usually bigger on iOS because, unlike Android, they can't share libraries, they're totally sandboxed. My biggest space hog is Spotify at 35.4GB. But again, why I got a 128GB phone. Second biggest is a game taking up about a tenth of that. Followed by VLC, which contains all videos stored on this phone (I don't use iTunes). Get a bigger phone, man. You'll thank yourself for it many times. Or go on arbitrarily limiting yourself. But don't think it's anything but that. MJ What? I don't need a bigger phone? I mentioned nothing about storage? Limiting myself? What are talking about? LOL How about you stop trolling? Nathan J This word, trolling. It doesn't mean what you think it means. If anything, you were trolling and I tried to respond rationally. Grow up. MJ You wrote a 100 some word essay about how I needed a "bigger" phone that was not relevant to anything. BLOCKED Nathan J Run on home to your safe space, bully. Ladies and gentlemen, this is why you stand up to bullies. They usually fold. Occasionally, in epic fashion. Especially online when they find out they don't have quite the presence they do on the playground. Jorge I guess no ad blocker will work on Android if you still use Chrome. Chrome serves the content right to you instead of your phone fetching the content from the source website. You need to use a different browser to block ads. Nathan J You guess incorrectly. What you're experiencing is Google proxying around your ad blocker. You have Chrome's data saver turned on. Bypassing your ad blocker is an unintended side effect. Turn off the data saver feature and the ad blocker will in fact block ads in Chrome. Chrome is not magically evading your ad blocker. You're just using Google's proxy instead of the one your ad blocker establishes. And that's really all there is to it. However, the Google App on iOS (Google Search + Now) will always proxy around an ad blocker. I don't know if it's a data saver that just can't be disabled (which would explain it) or malice on Google's part. I'm leaning toward the latter. But the fact remains, if I Google gaming stuff and go to a Wikia site, I get slammed with ads. If I Bing it, the ads don't show up. And Bing makes a great app. Shame fandroids slam it Because It's Not Google. Real shame. They're missing out. Jorge Adguard tells you what browsers work with adblockers on install. They only accept Yandex and Samsung Internet. There's no option to make it work with Chrome and I'm forced to install one of those if I want to continue with the installation. Anyways, I'll give it a try disabling data saver but it hasn't worked in the past with other ad blockers. Carsten AdGuard DOES work with Chrome, but not the browser-plugin adguard, you have to use the full app adguard. It even works with data saver, what confuses me, but it does. Necdet Ali Özdür Try Samsung Browser on mobile, it supports ad blocking. MJ I already have an ad blocker and no interest in the Samsung browser. LOL Hrishikesh Bisen Why? bekifft I've been impressed with Brave, it's basically uBlock plus https everywhere. Or Adguard if you must use Chrome. It's worth it. I wouldn't mind ads if they didn't try to hijack my phone and install malware. senor_heisenberg Noice, about time. Tom Erlandsen Google working on an ad-blocker? Now there's something I never expected to read haha JD Gotta finish off the competition somehow. They weren't going to do it by releasing polished products Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ LOL, unfortunately, true. My1 google releases polish products? do they also have a subcompany on Poland? SCNR. demarcmj He said "They weren't going to do it by releasing polished products" Bombaglad have you ever heard of editing comments? Jorge Yes, only Adsense will pass the "fair ad policy" and will be correctly displayed. All the other "your phone is full of viruses" won't be displayed. I will miss the sexy vibrations in my hand. :-( JG Does ChromeOS fall into the desktop category? or is this going to be browser only? kenspiracy ChromeOS would fall into the desktop category, yes. 4Ui812 Adgaurd for the win and the block. Untung Dwi Prasetyo Yes D.Smithee They make a great content blocker for Samsung browser--and let's face it, their Adguard VPN blocker for unrooted Android is a godsend. Cakefish I have a choice to use either the preinstalled Chrome browser or the preinstalled Samsung Internet browser on my phone. Samsung Internet supports adguard content blocker. Chrome does not. The choice is clear. In fact, it's hard to call it a choice. There is only one viable option to take. D.Smithee Did you not see my mention of the Adguard VPN that blocks ads in all browsers? So, yeah--you can use Chrome. Carsten I never thought I would pay for an ad blocker, but AdGuard ist sooooooo ♥ ♥ ♥ ! Also, right into the face of haters: "There is no get-everything-free-world today!" - "Dude, I'm actaully PAYING for not seeing ads!" :D Madis Surely you're paying, but who the money goes to is what matters... Carsten Yep, it is. You see, the argument against adblockers is: "There must be ads, otherwise everything would cost money and don't tell me you would pay for stuff online! Aha! So don't be an a-hole and disable your adblocker." But: I am paying! That's the point: Not just being a guy who wants everything for free, but saying "yes, I am okay with paying for good content." Problem is, websites with ads are no good content, while an adblocker is. Johny M This is not good. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/a6fddce77432d41dfcd3c6f79fcc7fa1244c36a5ce08a0227a141e8521e57f3e.gif So the biggest online add company will punish websites that post "bad" commercials. What can go wrong with that? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Exactly. Google ad services monopoly, here we come. Necdet Ali Özdür It's been done before. I mean blocking "bad" commercials. Almost all browsers now have an option to block pop up pages. I consider this an extension of it. rockstarr27 Google will use it to block non google approved ads, furthering their monopoly. Predictable. 4Ui812 Bingo MaroonMushroom All of the bigger advertising companies would probably meet Google's standards without issue. I'm sure the bar will be set low enough to mostly target the full screen ads that say your Android phone has 6 memory viruses while it's vibrating at you. rockstarr27 "Google will only block the bad ads, they wouldn't ever try to make their ad blocking more dominant compared to competitors with this move." - Ah to be young and naive. saf1927 Ah yes, because they want another antitrust case on them. As if Android weren't enough of a headache. Yep, really nice to be naive. LAMMJR O plz god yes, block those stupid ads that block chrome in android, spamming pop ups and using vibration saying my phone will be destroyed in x seconds if I don't install whaterver app they tell me to. Carson Saldanha Omg fr. I can't believe this is still a thing. Max I only can wish suffering to whoever developed those nasty ads. Nicoleckeys Google is paying 97$ per hour!

Mr.Bean ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I would think they put those ads for curious eyes. LOL Stop playing with yourself and these ads will disappear! Defenestratus Sadly it's not just porn sites that have those these days. LAMMJR This is not exclusive to porn sites, porn sites are probably worse. Any site that offers ad-suported download can end up having one of those annoying ads. For example, sites that uses ad.fly as url shortening can end up stuffing this type of ads on your face. Modest Mind I'm not sure Google will integrate an adblocker to Chrome because Google and Ads are synonymous. Unless Google integrates an add-blocker that has a "white list" and Google Ads are at the top of that list. demarcmj They're just blocking "bad" ads Randroid Read the article. It's going to be the opposite. It's going to be a blacklist of ads that are dangerous, annoying, or intrusive Modest Mind Annoying, intrusive? That is the definition of Google ad business... justmy2pennies2012 The ones the block what you are reading and stays oin the screen as you scroll down are the worst. alexb88 Use Adguard! YaKillaCJ Oh that sounds horrible. I didn't kno ads got that bad. Been using AdAway for years now. Latheryin Ads will never be accepted by everyone. A lot of people see no use for them at all and will continue to block all ads. If they wanted commercials they can watch cable. Max Be careful with what you wish, the day ads die is the day everything will be paid on internet. TechGuy22 Like pirate don't exist lol tookieboy stupid people do though. happy pirating your gmail account Latheryin Yeah that will never happen. Even if it cuts people's use of the Internet by 65% that would not be a bad thing. And like TechGuy22 said. It will be broken. DragoCubed I can see a future with less outright box ads and ads that are hard to even tell that they are ads. Sponsored content and stuff. TechGuy22 Block these ads or the hijacked one on here specially https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/1abd2d9979769332aaaefa91b671e6683737b8fb001f1b9b41820b6a94d1eee9.png Josh Crumley But look at this one weird trick I learned! https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/c8c0b953c6e85700fbc7f7073a9f5ec68cb6a87dbf0c0afbca12b88428163ea5.png ilovetesla seriously , try it , its very good and a healthy tip for the phone internet never lies Jorge That only works on iOS.

Totally worth it ilovetesla #FANTAPOWER Chris ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) How fantastic. Bruce Wayne Those ads are annoying. They are usually served up by a company called Outbrain. Jorge They're not that annoying. No other ads make your phone vibrate that sexy. Bruce Wayne Jorge, I'm going to need you to take your phone out of your pants. Jorge Why? I like the vibes inside my pants. They put me in the mood. Cakefish And Taboola and Revcontent jonzey231 "You'll never guess what she looks like now!!" Brian Kittelson I have add blocked these. Some of these are borderline NSFW. I don't need T&A ads while browsing a tech news website at work thank you. DragoCubed Awesome sauce LOL So no more pussiеs and тiтs on the side bar? Damn.... Michael Hazell Never thought I'd see the day that Google would assume the role as an ad blocker, but honestly I appreciate them filtering those ads on mobile devices where it's like "your device has 6 million viruses, install to fix." Those are just cancer and needed to be blocked anyways. I've been such a heavy ad blocker that I forgot what it's like to deal with cancerous ads on the internet. xmascarroll For some reason, my stock V20 always gets "Android Alert! Your device, GENERIC ANDROID DEVICE, has xxx viruses! Run Android GENERIC ANDROID DEVICE Cleaner now!" D.Smithee We'll assume you didn't run said cleaner. ilovetesla then, follow the instructions, its a generic cleaner Jorge What are you waiting for? Go do that right now. Your phone and your bank account will appreciate that. YuCMi Yes please! If this works the way it is described here, I'll turn off my indiscriminate adblocker. Dmitry Stepanushkin ADBlock. Problem solved 😂 Lord Argyris Somehow I'm categorizing this one in the "I'll believe it when I see it" category. It sounds an awful lot like an Outbrain story, which, incidentally enough, is one of the reasons people run ad blockers. That all said, these are the kinds of things I want to see blocked: -Anything that autoplays, makes noise, etc. -Anything that blinks, pops up, obscures the screen, or otherwise tries to distract me -Clickbait repos -Any and all forms of tracking--leave ad content selection up to the host site, or just push random ads The first two might be reasonably expected from a hypothetical Google ad blocker, but the third is questionable (the stories don't usually run afoul of the other criteria on the list; they're just trashy and take up page space and bandwidth). For the last one, however, I can barely hear myself typing over the laughter of the big ad companies (Google included). Tracking makes ads much more effective, and I don't see anything (apart from federal regulation, which has its own problems, not to mention scope limitations) that will ever manage to shove that genie back into the bottle. I'll play along with the rumor for a moment. What Google is likely doing here is protecting not just its ad revenue, but its ability to build up tracking data, which is immensely valuable. Trackers can be blocked by sufficiently motivated individuals, and third party extensions make this a lot easier. This is where Google wants to move in. By offering a basic solution to casual ad blockers, who just don't want to deal with the annoyance and page slowdown of heavily ad-infested sites, Google is ensuring that those tracking cookies are still set and that it (Google) and other third party ad companies can keep harvesting that data, even if people aren't seeing as many annoying ads. As an end user, this benefits me in some ways and hurts me in others. On the one hand, I feel like the presence of a Chrome-native, on-by-default blocker will bring about at least some progress on eradicating the Internet of the worst ad offenders, particularly if the penalty for non-compliance is that your site gets no revenue whatsoever from Chrome users who stick with the defaults. On the other hand, this will put the squeeze on more capable third party extensions that offer more granular control (as well as the ability to block more than just the ads themselves), which might drive some of them out of the market. Also, it abstracts the issue of tracking away from ad blocking--everybody can see the ads (and be creeped out at how relevant they are), but fewer people know about the tracking behind the scenes. If Google just makes some of the most annoying ads go away, many people will be satisfied, even if the tracking is still taking place. It also seems dangerously close to the sort of anticompetitive behavior commonly associated with late 90s-era Microsoft, since it's clear Google isn't being altruistic here. It's going to benefit from this initiative, and disproportionately to the other players in the market (both ad blockers and other ad companies). Notice what's not ever going to be blocked: Google-sourced ads. Everything else is theoretically fair game. Companies looking to advertise, as well as sites looking for ad revenue, will both be more confident in going with the Google ad platform than with competitors because they know that their ads will be compliant and that they won't risk losing revenue due to Google's ad blocker. We'll see how this shakes out. If a Chrome ad blocker is indeed under consideration, I suspect this information was purposely leaked to see what sort of reaction it gets. ast00 Block ads? Yes, please. Only accept AdSense? Oh hell no! (please link the gif) bozzykid The report says it will use the same "Acceptable Ads" that Adblock Plus supports so it wouldn't be accepting just Adsense. tookieboy don't bother.. people don't read ast00 I know what it says, but Google is no stranger to uncompetitive tactics. bozzykid I'm not sure you can read. The report makes it clear. Cory Wilson I want to be rid of the stupid ads that take over the whole screen and say "congratulations we're giving away giftcards to users who live in , you have 5 minutes to redeem". you can't get out of them unless you close the window and reopen. Anonymous and what about adsense? My1 well I think google isnt stupid enough to make adsense that bad so it would fall under the blocking guidelines, I mean adsense ads I saw were iirc usually just banners on the top, bottom or side. cr08 Yeah. Adsense has always been really lean and unobstrusive with their ads. I'd be happy with allowing adsense ads and also ads from other networks that are also unobtrusive. Hopefully with Google's knack for self learning algorithims they can nail this down. D.Smithee It's good news--but a little too late, Google. I've been using a content blocker since the very early 2000's with Firefox. Now I use uBlock Origin with Chrome desktop. I came to the conclusion a LONG time ago that sites don't have our best interests at heart. Even the ones that proclaim they do. For me, ads/trackers/etc. became a security issue quite some time ago--I just can't trust sites, so I just block ALL ads/trackers/undesirable content. And if a site objects to it or blocks users using content blockers, I just get my information elsewhere. It's that simple. Branko So awesome. Will it eventually filter "hate speech" and "fake news" too Google? If you want to place in a mechanism for ad blocking, users must have control over it. Otherwise it's prone to abuse of self interests. Go fuck yourselves Google. Disphouf Thats funny, I changed Chrome with Brave browser because their adblocker givitumibeybi lol. I can't understand why everyone is so excited. This will just be an Embrace, Extend, and Extinguish move. Kwetsima Maluleke Wow Google. Not bad. Its not like Samsung and Apple haven't had ad blockers for years now. givitumibeybi What's the difference between morals of using torrents to install overpriced things for free, and using adblockers to get access to the content of a website with disturbing advertisements for free? Cakefish - Taboola - Outbrain - Revcontent ^ THIS SCOURGE OF THE INTERNET MUST BE DESTROYED!!! I will not retire the use of my adblocker until those companies are wiped off the face of the planet. Truly, they are evil incarnate. They must die in a pit of flaming fury. Morten Ulv I wonder what happens on pages that block people from reading if they have an ad blocker. My mother would surely not know what to do. Markus Birth The fun thing is: Once EVERY Chrome user gets blocked from viewing those pages, they will very soon die or turn off their adblock-blocker. Better for everyone. Zach Mauch Hopefully it will also fight against adds using excessive processing. That is the major reason I still run it on sites as prominent as Android Central. They can just destroy performance. jonzey231 I could see this turning an anti-competition suit very quickly. It wouldn't be intentional but it would end up being Google blocking their own competitor's ads while allowing their own to flourish. It'll be seen the same as Android using only Google as the default search provider...and that definitely hasn't gone well for them abroad. Mark Curtis ALL ads are bad, I'm entitled to free content, gimme gimme gimme Chris Sanner I'll be honest - if they do this, I'd probably disable my other ad blocker entirely. I don't mind ALL ads, it's the ones that are COMPLETELY obnoxious that cause me to block the rest. currently most hated? the ones that show up as you scroll through a story and you have to scroll through them to get back to scrolling the site. John Petersen No way. This is just asking for abuse and conflicts of interest. Just enable add-ons for mobile, and let unvested third parties take care of the ad-blocking. PVL_93_RU I'm waiting to see how advertisement companies find a way around this built-in blocking LOL I am using adblocker via router so all devices connected are blocked BC This would be a lovely thing because I only disdain the annoying adverts that pop up and block my screen...Banners aren't bad as I can see those without having content obscured, also Google needs to get better at blocking the ads that cause redirects. Those really piss me off. PIucky Duck 🇩🇪 Rooted phone with AdAway is the way to go F4LL0U7 FYI, Adguard for Android is awesome. No root required. They have a desktop Chrome extension too, if you like having your ad blockers match across all devices. Michael Payton Endgame will be to block all ads not sold thru Google. That's how they make most of they're money, and other people will have to advertise thru them to get their ads seen. Vivek Rameses Don't be fooled, all ads are bad. YaKillaCJ Or here's a better idea, allow extensions in mobile. Maybe keep it in the beta to keep away the average person or at least express its a little advance. Brandon Good! Google is the ONLY ad network I trust to not contain malware. Until these websites properly audit their ad content and ensure it's not laden with malware then I will continue running an ad-blocker and a DNS blackhole. Anyone with a Pi checkout PiHole. bekifft If only Google offered some sort of service that would let you pay them money to block the ads...you'd still contribute to the sites, but only the ones that serve Google ads. They could call it something like... Google Contributor maybe? Just a crazy idea... I know I'd use it...

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Friday, 21 April 2017 | MYT 10:30 AM Apple Maps update for Europe includes focus on electric vehicles Improving its mapping products has become a key focal point for Apple in its battle with Alphabet Inc's Google. — Apple Apple Inc is expanding the capabilities of its Maps app in Europe to help users charge their electric vehicles or find bike rental hubs, in another bid to keep iPhone users away from rival Google.  The company has added the locations of the UK’s electric vehicle charging stations by incorporating data from Munich-based Cirrantic’s Moovility service, which lists re-juicing points for cars made by Tesla and Nissan, among others.  It has also added public bicycle rental and drop-off points to maps of London, New York and Paris in a catch-up to long-time mobile navigation leader Google, which has listed such stations in multiple countries for some time.  Improving its mapping products has become a key focal point for Apple in its battle with Alphabet Inc's Google. In May last year, Apple's chief executive officer Tim Cook said his company would open a new Indian development centre in Hyderabad, with a specific focus on speeding up the development of more competitive mapping tools. It plans to employ as many as 4,000 people in that facility.  In December, Bloomberg reported that Cupertino, California-based Apple is assembling a team to use drones to create and update map information faster than it can currently do with camera-equipped road vehicles. “There are thousands of layers of useful information that could be added to digital maps as an overlay,” said Martin Garner, an analyst at CCS Insight, “and there's a benefit in becoming known for adding as many as possible. But adding overlays like this is an enormous undertaking and needs an industrial approach in order to source, manage and maintain the information for a large number of layers across many countries.”  Apple first integrated transit information for the UK into Apple Maps in December, which includes route information for trains and busses across the nation, as well as London Underground services in the capital.  According to data compiled by Zap-Map, there are just under 4,400 locations in Britain for recharging an electric vehicle. More than 3,000 of these will now be marked in Apple Maps. To identify these, Apple is using live data provided by Munich-based Cirrantic GmbH, a mobility services company founded in 2014, and pinpointing EV charge points on a map. Google lists charging points globally but doesn’t explicitly label them with easily identifiable icons.  “We think that consistent, live information of the growing charger infrastructure increases the confidence of EV drivers and, especially with Apple Maps, attracts new user groups to sustainable mobility offerings like EV cars,” said Arne Meusel, CEO and co-founder of Cirrantic. “In the UK we started with supporting the major charger operators, including Podpoint, CYC, Ecotricity, NPower and NewMotion. Any interested operator is welcome to set up a connection with us.” — Bloomberg Related Stories You May Be Interested Olympic Council welcomes eSports at Asian Games, ‘FIFA 2017’ named China's Bitauto unit raises US$1bil from Internet giants Tencent, Baidu Facebook out to read minds Lufthansa, Air France departures briefly hit by computer outage How to own your first home with zero down payment Pedalling to save the planet Others Also Read Inaugural football course a big hit India opener Rahul set to miss Champions Trophy Discovering Asia’s Las Vegas advertisement Latest News Messaging app said to be used in White House does not work: lawsuit Spotify ensures independent artistes are on board with fresh deal Robots, chefs hope to bring invasive lion fish to restaurants near you Uber extends sexual harassment probe; expects report by end-May German chancellery investigated in probe into WikiLeaks sources Most Viewed in Tech Uber extends sexual harassment probe; expects report by end-May Robots, chefs hope to bring invasive lion fish to restaurants near you Uber could face higher licence fees in London under new proposals German chancellery investigated in probe into WikiLeaks sources Lufthansa, Air France departures briefly hit by computer outage Xiaomi’s preparing to make a comeback with latest marquee phone Alibaba backs decision to add videogames to ‘Asia Olympics’ Tinder survey unveils naked truths about Millennial dating The biggest time suck at the office might be your computer Experts say automated accounts sharing fake news ahead of French election Powered by advertisement advertisement site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Lifestyle Tech Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services Magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs Advertising View Our Rate Card Policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu StarProperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com Search The Star Online Connect with us Content Partner Our Radio Stations site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Tech Lifestyle Travel Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs advertising View Our Rate Card policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu starproperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com social media Facebook Twitter Copyright © 1995- Star Media Group Berhad (ROC 10894D)

Google did not mention when exactly we can expect the feature, but as it turns out we didn’t have to wait too long because in a blog post, Google has confirmed that the feature is now available to Google Home users. According to Google, “Starting today, I can—and so can you. We’re adding the ability for up to six people to connect their account to one Google Home. So now when I ask my Google Assistant for help, it can distinguish my voice from my wife’s and I can hear my own personal playlists, my own commute time, my own schedule and more.” How it works is that Google Home will identify users by their voice to know who they are and what their preferences are so as to offer up a more personalized experience. This is done when users connect their account on a Google Home device, after which they will be asked to say a couple of phrases which are then analyzed by a neural network to detect characteristics in a person’s voice to determine who they are. Once that’s done, Google Home should have no problems distinguishing between its users. The feature is expected to be made available to users in the US first, but it is expected to eventually expand to the UK in the coming months. Filed in Gadgets >Home.

Venture capitalist Chamath Palihapitiya led a $10 million investment in the start-up. The Project is in secretive stealth mode. Ari Levy | @levynews 5 Hours AgoCNBC.com SHARES David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty Images Larry Page Google has slowly been pulling back the curtain on homegrown silicon that could define the future of machine learning and artificial intelligence. Some key creators of that project -- the Tensor Processing Unit, or TPU -- recently left to team up with Chamath Palihapitiya, one of Silicon Valley's most prominent and outspoken young venture investors, on a stealth start-up. Groq Inc. is the name of the company, at least for the time being. There's no website and no promotional materials. All that exists online are a couple SEC filings from October and December showing that the company raised $10.3 million, and an incorporation filing in the state of Delaware on September 12. "We're really excited about Groq," Palihapitiya wrote in an e-mail. "It's too early to talk specifics, but we think what they're building could become a fundamental building block for the next generation of computing." Groq names three principals in the SEC documents: Jonathan Ross, who helped invent the TPU, Douglas Wightman, an entrepreneur and former engineer at the Google X "moonshot factory" and Palihapitiya, the founder of investment firm Social Capital. The listed address is Social Capital's headquarters. Palihapitiya told CNBC last month that he invested in a team of ex-Googlers who helped build the chip, which he first heard about on an earnings call two-and-a-half years ago. "They randomly mentioned that they built their own chip for AI and I thought, what is going on here, why is Google competing with Intel?" Palihapitiya said in an interview on "Squawk Box." show chapters Chamath Palihapitiya: I spent 1½ years trying to find the people who made Google's AI chip    Thursday, 16 Mar 2017 | 10:39 AM ET | 00:38 The company (which we now know is Groq) now has eight of the first 10 people from the TPU team "building a next-generation chip," he said. All start-ups are hard, but a new chip company is something most venture capitalists won't touch. The research and development costs required to get a working prototype can be exorbitant. Then there's manufacturing and the Herculean challenge of finding device makers to take a chance on unproven technology. Also, the incumbents -- Intel, Qualcomm and Nvidia -- are massive, and Google, Apple and Amazon are developing their own silicon. As crazy as it may be, Palihapitiya is taking the plunge. This next wave of chip innovation "can empower companies like Facebook and Amazon, Tesla, the government to do things with machine learning and computers that nobody could do before," he said in last month's interview. Ross's LinkedIn page says he left Google in September and is currently "gainfully unemployed." According to Wightman's profile, he left the same month but doesn't say where he went. Wightman confirmed the funding in an e-mail and said, "we're still heads down right now." Launching the TPU Google made its first public pronouncement about the TPU in May with a blog post just ahead of the company's annual developers conference. Norm Jouppi, one of the project heads, said Google had been using the technology internally for over a year for things like improving the relevance of search results and the accuracy of its maps. It's also part of Google's Cloud Platform in a product called TensorFlow that lets other companies run machine learning workloads in Google's data centers. The essence of TPUs is the ability to squeeze heavy and highly sophisticated computation into less silicon. Machine learning, or the training of computers to get smarter as datasets increase and without the need of human interference, is weaving its way into all types of consumer and business apps. At Google's scale, that work is too taxing for today's processors. Palihapitiya said at a conference in January that the main reason he's bullish on Google as an investment is because "they're an order of magnitude ahead" of everyone else. He's not the only investor paying attention. Denny Fish, a portfolio manager who focuses on technology at Janus, said that Google is doing everything it can to ensure maximum performance and efficiency to handle the heft of machine learning workloads. Source: Google Google’s tensor processing unit or TPU. "They've said, if we're going to do this and win, we need the most efficient way using the least amount of power," he said. "They feel like they've cracked the code." Earlier this month, Google provided its first real update on TPUs in a 17-page report titled, "In-Datacenter performance analysis of a Tensor Processing Unit." In a summary blog post, Jouppi wrote that AI workloads using TPUs are running 15 to 30 times faster than contemporary processors, while efficiency is 30 to 80 times better. The study compared TPUs to chips from Intel and Nvidia. Ross was one of 75 authors of the report. He's also listed in the paper as an inventor on four patents, all tied to neural networks processors and computation, which you can think of as computing systems designed to mimic the brain. Ross's LinkedIn page says he started the TPU with one other engineer as part of a 20 percent project, the perk that lets Google employees spend one-fifth of their time working on a side project they think will benefit the company. From 2013 to 2015, he worked as a Google hardware engineer in Madison, Wisconsin, home to one of the principal hotbeds of TPU development. Wightman co-founded four companies prior to his Google days. At Google X he worked on futuristic projects like Loon, a network of balloons that's setting out to provide a more extensive internet.

An update released on Thursday enables Home's built-in assistant to learn the different voices of up to six people, although they can't all be talking to the internet-connected speaker at the same time. Distinguishing voices will allow Home to be more personal in some of its responses, depending on who triggers the assistant with the phrase, "OK Google" or "Hey Google." For instance, once Home is trained to recognise a user named Joe, the assistant will automatically be able to tell him what traffic is like on his commute, list events on his daily calendar or even play his favourite songs. Then another user named Jane could get similar information from Home, but customised for her. The ability to distinguish voices may help Home siphon sales from Amazon.com's Echo, a competing product that features its own voice-activated assistant, Alexa.

Even with multi-user support, Google Home can't create reminders or calendar appointments Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/04/20 1:39pm PDTApr 20, 2017 31 Plus 1 on G+ 20 Share on Facebook 40 Share on Twitter Total Shares91 Google Google Home News Videos Google announced multi-user support for Google Home earlier today, but it's only launching in the US right now. This is finally a chance for Google to rectify things and add all those features Home was lacking at launch, and indeed Google has included a few new features. We're still missing some big ones, though. You still cannot create a reminder or add events to your calendar. After going through the setup process for multi-user, Google Home has access to some of your personal account information. That allows you to ask questions about what's on your calendar, view photos tied to your Google Photos account, and so on. However, writing data to your account appears to be a sticking point. If you try to create a reminder or a calendar appointment, Home tells you it can't do that yet, just like it did before. Hopefully the addition of multi-user support will let Google add these very basic features soon. Seriously, adding something to your calendar has to be one of the most common tasks for a human assistant. It's certainly not impossible to do this stuff, either. Assistant on the phone can create reminders and events just fine. Tags Google google assistant google home video subscribe ...

I'll make millions (of reminders)! Good_Ole_Pinocchio Google can't even handle the basics of their own services here.....SAD! lzdking Make Google Great Again! #MGGA mark555055d Such a disappointment. Google better start ramping up the functions on this thing or it will fail. Also, if they do something stupid like releasing a Google home 2 anytime soon, the shit will fly. LondonLeedsFan I thought about Google Home 2 about 3 days after buying this one and realising it doesn't do so much... I can't help but think it's going to happen. mark555055d Yeah... i could totally see them doing something stupid like making a GH2, with bluetooth pairing capability, improving the mics and speaker, charging $30 more for it, and then giving it an "exclusive" software version that allows reminders and calendar support, all while leaving the GH1 back for months due to "hardware differences". LondonLeedsFan IMO something like this should not be on a 1 or 2 year upgrade cycle. If that's how it goes, I'll leave it! Pete Still no assistant on my Nexus 5X in the UK! LondonLeedsFan Have you set phone language to English US and got latest play services? That will basically push it to your phone within 5 minutes. Pete Latest Play Services (even gone for the beta), same with Google app. As for language, tried that & it didn't work, but why should I? They say it's available in the UK and various other manufacturers (Samsung, OnePlus etc) have made it available on theirs, but Google haven't rolled it out to Nexus devices over here yet. A farce. LondonLeedsFan I have a 6P in the UK and I've had it for about 6 weeks now. Strange. Roderick Gadellaa I don't have it on my Moto X 2014 either and I updated the Google app, Play Services and even edited the build.prop. Somehow it's not working for everyone yet. That said, on the Moto X it may be Moto Voice that's the problem because it also prevents Ok Google hotword detection from anywhere but the Google app itself - it doesn't even work in Google Now On Tap although the searchbar says "Say OK Google". Leonardo Baez create reminder to bitch about you. :,D brian. Careful, she'll turn that insult on you... sbeaulieu The biggest problem assistant got is support. Only one country(officialy). dcdttu Gotta have one before the other, maybe. So that's what they hopefully are going to do next. pfmiller Once you can distinguish between users that's all you should need for both reading and writing appointments. I'm wondering if they are not fully confident in the reliability of the multiple user recognition, so they figure implementing read-only functions is safer while they work on getting the reliability up. denisu So, am I right in saying it can only make calendar disappointments? elchuby Can't even do that. Crystalatracy Managing director of Google!, is explaining to users to start off "Work at home" method, that People have been doing for about one year now. These days alone, I generated close to $36,000 until now with no more than my home computer as well as some spare time, despite that i have a fulltime 9 to 5 job.

Artem Russakovskii (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻ Gaurav Arora Please keep the table back where it was senor_heisenberg Goddamn Aaron Berlin I'm sure that's coming. I'm more excited to find out how they intend to handle messaging, though. surethom I'm sorry but why can Google not do the most simplest things. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Because they're a bunch of overpaid prima donnas who think they're geniuses but can't even match what a simple diligent grunt coder can do. M6 Over 90% of those grunt coders you mention probably couldn't write a simple service that serves a 'hello world' webpage at the thousands of QPS that Google's least popular services have to handle. Most of the work done to spin up such a service are done by SREs not SWEs. This is why start ups can add features so quickly. They simply don't have that many users and can worry about scalability after they get popular, and they have months if not years to work out a scalable solution in the meantime. Also, most grunt coders that add features quickly end up accumulating vast amounts of technical debt in the code they write. Morten Ulv Readers of Android Police are highly trained in pitchforking and kneejerk reactions. No critical thought allowed here, get out! abqnm If I hired an assistant and he or she couldn't add appointments to my calendar, I'd fire that motherfucker on the spot. I guess it must be time to get jobs at Google. Because they sure as shit don't know what an assistant is or what they are supposed to be able to do. Morten Ulv I'm sure they are not aware of the problem and that you would totally be fix it in 5 minutes. That's how it is, I'm sure! Lateef Alabi-Oki I'm just glad that the multiuser support works as well as it does. It hasn't failed in distinguishing the voices in my household. My spouse told it to show pictures from Google Photos and it executed. It's truly magical. Forgive my honeymoon phase. I'll be back to bitching in a day or two. makapav The next thing Google needs to enable us family sharing of all pictures and albums instead of doing it one by one. mustbepbs Still can't even add time to an existing fucking timer. Seriously, this company has the weirdest priorities. makapav Stickers FTW! Duder12 Google literally just tackled the biggest hurdle. Its all game over from here on out for the competition. bozzykid Considering you can hardly do anything with the multi-user support, it isn't even clear if it truly works. Martin Still don't get the point of this trash... If it can't make a simple reminder or cal app... What for people use it? Weather? Time? When you are surrounded or 10 more gadgets doing the same (watch, phone, tv, Pc and many more)... This is why I am never too exited when Google releases something new, it's never good, not even close to what they promise it is going to be... :) Matt Terk I have 3 devices, whole home music is wonderful along with all the assistant functions and control of all my smarthome devices. It would be hard to live without it now. boop It's the cheapest cast-enabled speaker I know of and it works fantastically. The voice commands for pulling up music are also best-in-class. I have a few smart home devices as well and virtually any combination of words construable as a command mumbled from anywhere in the room will do what I want. I doesn't do everything it ought to but it does quite a lot and does it exceptionally well. jdrch Google Home: a solution in desperate search of a problem. Deeco AP is the biggest Android media site, please make articles about all the short comings of Google and shame them until we are heard. Too much crap going on itsatrap Why people buy this thing? Morten Ulv Because these small (but important) issues will get ironed out and Google has a much better potential than Amazon at nailing it. JG What about Hangouts? I'm assuming since you said it can't yet write to the account, could it at least read my incoming Hangouts to me? davidofmidnight never forget...

However the good news is that in May, all Android Wear devices that are eligible for the update should get the update already. This is according to a recent post on Google’s Support website in which Google posted a list of devices that will be getting the update either by the end of April or sometime late May. This includes devices such as the Moto 360 Gen 2, Moto 360 Sport, LG Watch Urbane 2nd Edition LTE, Huawei Watch, Huawei Watch Ladies, Asus ZenWatch 2, and Asus ZenWatch 3. None of these devices have yet to receive their update so if you own any of them, then do keep an eye out for it. Android Wear 2.0 is supposed to represent a pretty major update for the Android Wear platform. It was originally planned for a release last year but Google delayed it due to feedback they got from developers. We know that it’s been a long time coming but all of the waiting should eventually come to a close by the end of next month, so until then Android Wear users who have yet to receive the update will just have to remain patient.

The size of the deal was not disclosed, while the company said that acquisition will allow it to develop Real View Digital Map Twin, a 360-degree mapping platform. VIDTEQ had raised an undisclosed Series A funding from KITVEN in 2011, a VC firm operated by a consortium of Karnataka state-owned corporations. VIDTEQ was founded by Chandra Thimmannagari and Navada Muraleedhara in May of 2008. Its VideoMaps software is live in 20 cities across India and the technology is being used by builders, schools, resorts, businesses, etc. for construction and planning operations. Apart from this, VIDTEQ develops other mapping software with three-dimensional modeling, and products like Drone View, 360 Interior/Exterior View, among others. VIDTEQ also owns mapmyhome.com, a real estate listing portal for new project launches. Issues with geospatial mapping in India Note that in India, the Ministry of Home Affairs had issued a draft “Geospatial Information Regulation Bill” last year which sprang up a debate around how map data is collected by private companies. The bill looked at regulating collection of map-related info, creation of digital maps, and even sharing of map-related data. Although the bill yet to be passed, it could literally make it illegal for private companies and individuals to collect mapping data without a license, and also hinder services of companies like Ola, Uber, Google Maps etc. who depend mainly on map data. Advertisement Interestingly, MayMyIndia’s competitor WoNoBo which had raised close to  $35 million investment, suspended its consumer-facing “street view” website a month after the geospatial bill was issued. Around the same time, Google’s 360-degree panoramic street view feature ran into trouble with government officials who hired security agencies to check whether Google’s Street View compromised India’s “security Interest”. Google’s Street View feature also has a history of issues when it comes to India. Google ran into trouble with Bangalore Police in June 2013 as the Commissioner of Police asked Google to stop Street View cars from plying in Bangalore. In September 2013, Google relaunched Street View in India by focusing only on private properties like Sula Vineyards. At that time we had pointed out irregularities in how the government looked at mapping companies: Local firms like VIDTEQ were already being allowed to map out cities and publish videos of streets online, while Google was not. MapMyIndia funding and partnerships  Flipkart had picked up a minority stake in MapmyIndia for an undisclosed amount in December 2015.

Multi-user voice recognition is rolling out to Google Home today Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/04/20 9:01am PDTApr 20, 2017 70 Plus 1 on G+ 125 Share on Facebook 89 Share on Twitter Total Shares284 Google News Videos Update 1: 2017/04/20 12:02pm PDT Here is the setup flow, courtesy of Artem Russakovskii: Bringing Google Assistant out of the phone and dropping it into Google Home comes with some difficulties. Not the least of which is, how do you handle personal account preferences and data when Google Home is available to everyone in the house? Until now the solution has been "don't." Starting today, you can register multiple users with your Google home, which recognizes them by voice. To set this up. look for a device card in the Home app that says"Multi-user is now available" or "Link your account." The setup process has you say the "OK Google" and "Hey Google" hotwords twice each. From then on, Google Home will be able to provide personal results because it knows who you are. The same is true for up to five other people in the house. The personal results affected by multi-user include My Day, calendars, flights, shopping lists, photos, and more. Each user of Google Home will also be asked to set some preferences for things like video and music services. If you set up a new user and don't do that, Google Home just defaults to the ones used by the first account. You can get started fiddling around with this today, but only in the US. Multi-user will roll out to the UK in the coming months.

Evolutionary at best. cusaitech Will this prevent ads from activating Google home? Jonathan Berry I believe unrecognized users will continue to work, just without the personalization it can do if it recognizes you. Shagnscooby I'm wondering if you can specify the default account if it's an unrecognized person. The biggest reason I've been looking forward to this is because of someone in my house using the Google Home for music with GPM and me in the car listening and it stops playing because of simultaneous streams. I'd probably specify one of my kids as the default account so it never overlaps my listening. Kakairo Yes! Can't wait to set this up when I get home. Hopefully adding calendar events and reminders isn't far behind. Carson Saldanha Roll out... :( Kakairo I've been lucky with roll outs lately, hopefully that streak continues. surethom UK coming month not good. Will this FINALLY let us ask for my music uploaded by artist name & song to play without a subscription? Defenestratus Thank goodness. I'm really sick of having my wife's terrible music selections showing up as recommendations in GPM. MrCalifornia If my wife doesn't have her own Google Music subscription can she not play music on Google Home anymore? Lisarbeams Managing director of Google!, is explaining to users to start off "Work at home" method, that People have been doing for about one year now.

M. Luciano Not without sharing your calendar to the other account. F4LL0U7 My IT department blocks sharing our work calendars externally. gSyncit is the only thing that worked for me, and it works great. I love getting my work meeting agenda & reminders on my personal phone & watch. Check it out. http://www.fieldstonsoftware.com/software/gsyncit4/ lgg4 On this note, whats the best way to manage a gapps vs gmail account? I have my calendar, google drive and play store apps all on my gapps acocunt, but gplay music and non-business stuff on my gmail. Shoudl i try to transfer everything over to my consumer gmail account and just share my biz calendar to personal? I ask this as features seem to be limited at times with gapps accounts and when i linked my gapps with Home (due to my calendar), it says it cannot access my agenda. David Hyman Will this allow me to use my Spotify account on my phone while my wife uses hers on our Google home? jonzey231 As long as she specifies her Spotify account under her profile, I wouldn't see why not. David Hyman If that's the case it would solve such a first world problem for us! Let's hope that's how it works jonzey231 My brother is adding my Fiancee and I to his GPM family plan right now so we can take advantage of this.

Morten Ulv My 6P is over two years old and I have both the battery and the bootloop issue. Luckily, in my Norway, phones (and most electronics) have by law a 5 year "extended warranty" (from the seller, not the manufacturer) to protect consumers from issues like this. NexusPhan You're posting on the wrong article. Also, no your 6P is not over two years old as it wasn't released two years ago. Morten Ulv Guess I fucked that up. I bought it used, and my reciept is from march 2015, so that's why. Maybe the preorder date or an error. benjammin03 What does it do with an unrecognized voice? Does it default to a primary account? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ "Google Home Problems With Multi-User Voice, Google Is Looking Into It" Story to be published in 5... 4... 3... Bill Van I can't wait to see if this multi-user update will work with my twin brother. Our voices are so close that we have always had a tough time trying to figure out who is speaking during many recording. I guess I'll find out later this evening but for now my fingers are crossed..... rslh This would be interesting to know. Google is smart, but not sure if it's THAT smart! I would think assigning different hot words for each user would be ideal, but what do I know. trickytree1984 So why the UK delay?

Deeco US only, In the coming months, End of Q4, Rolling out in a couple weeks... We are tired of this shit Google!!! Shai Pal Anyone succeeded in doing this outside of U.S?

Google may be sued over Nexus 6P early shutdown and bootloop issues Scott Scrivens View All Posts 2017/04/14 11:09am PDTApr 14, 2017 134 Plus 1 on G+ 296 Share on Facebook 83 Share on Twitter Total Shares513 Android OS Legal Marshmallow 6.0 News Nexus 6P The Android hardware space is fast beginning to look like a watered down episode of Suits. Following on from news earlier in the week that LG is facing a bootloop lawsuit regarding several of its phones, Huawei's Nexus 6P could be responsible for Google encountering a similar inconvenience. As well as being accused of the same bootloop problem that has blighted LG devices, there are reports from consumers that the Nexus 6P has a premature battery shutdown problem. We reported late last year that certain Huawei Nexus 6Ps were suffering from the early shutdown problem, causing them to die with as much as 60% battery still indicated. Now, law firm Chimicles & Tikellis LLP is investigating the possibility of bringing a class action lawsuit against Google on behalf of customers who have faced this issue. Also included in any potential suit would be the same bootloop issue that has also affected owners of the LG Nexus 5X. The problems have mostly been reported by users running Android 7.0 Nougat, but there are also claims that backpedalling to Marshmallow 6.0 on the same devices doesn't fix anything. Neither Google nor Huawei seems to be taking either responsibility or action to resolve issues such as these. While Google is aware of the problems, having assigned both the shutdown and bootloop issues in its tracker, its official position is that those affected by the issue should reach out to customer support for a replacement device. But customers going directly to Huawei about the fault are also out of luck, as they are being told that the problem is with the software and not the hardware, and thus not an issue covered by the manufacturer's warranty - whether it's still in date or not. This is a very frustrating situation for the consumer when neither company seems willing to investigate properly or hold their hands up. Let us know in the comments if any of you Nexus 6P owners have experienced either issue. We'll report back with any further developments as they come in.

Thankfully our Ombudsman financially bullies the carrier until we get a resolution in Australia. Got a free refurb replacement, hopefully won't suffer the same. Matthew Hanson Mine seems to love to die around 10%. As a few others have stated, the low power notification will appear, I will use it for a few minutes and then it powers off. The battery history shows this steep cliff falloff after beginning the recharging and power on. Melad360 i always saw my 6p shut off as soon as the power saving mode came on at 15% battery. this started to happen after an update, i think 7.0 or 7.1, never happened before that though Latheryin This really is a software issue with what they ship out to nexus devices. It also effects the nexus 6 from Motorola. Seems every nexus device that got 7.x has this issue. Packer Backer Nope, doesn't affect the Nexus 6. Provide some links or just don't comment. Latheryin Sorry not a baby sitter. Why not do some research before you post. Also might want to look at the source code and try to understand what you are talking about before posting. abrasive I myself did start to see this issue after about a year, but the device was easily replaced for another warranty-related issue. I would assume my clock was started over again. Not that I haven't seen the same problem on computers with old batteries, but I would hope to get substantially more mileage out of a battery. Nexus 6p Issues Its about time! There are so many issues with the Google branded phones, it doesn't make any sense. We have already reached out to the firm to provide any support they need in accomplishing their potential goal of this class action lawsuit. Its time someone sticks up for the consumers who have been ripped off by this multi-billion dollar company. In the mean time, please follow us on Twitter and sign our petition at Change.org regarding this very issue. We have a lot of signatures and would appreciate your's and your share as well. Thank you in advance! 3fren I'm seeing so many comments about the battery issue going away with just replacing it. I guess I have to give it try. I'm always cautious when it comes to replacing a OEM battery with a replica though. Doug The early shutdown has been an issue on my Nexus 6P ever since I upgraded to Android 7. This has been a frustrating experience - I cannot trust the phone to not die on me when I need it and find myself constant carrying an external battery pack so I can start my phone back up if it dies. P. Sherman Just get an iPhone. It has SIGNIFICANTLY LESS DEVASTATING defects and actually functional software Quality Control team. thereasoner Lol, iOS is the worst when it comes to software issues and iPhone hardware is junk. No Google devices have yet to suffer the nightmares that were error 53 and Touch Disease much less the related class action lawsuits against Apple because of them! Are you trying to be funny? P. Sherman Yeah, no Android devices have had to deal with Touch Disease or error 53. Instead, they spontaneously combust (Note 7,) bootloop for no reason at all (ALL LG'S,) have glass backs that pop out when exposed to a little heat (Xperia Z2 and Z3,) have nearly unusable Bluetooth connectivity (Pixel, Xperia Z5,) heat so badly you can cook an egg on it (every Android that had a massive update,)... I could go on! I'm simply stating that iOS has historically been significantly less buggy and disastrous than Android when a new update rolls around (Think the disaster that was KitKat to Lollipop. The transition from iOS 6 to 7 was SIGNIFICANTLY less dramatic than that in terms of bugs and drains.) Also, Have an open mind and stop automagically trashing the iPhone. The iPhone may be lacking significantly in some areas, but it has two significant advantages - USABILITY AND LONGEVITY. thereasoner Correct, any serious issues facing Android phones have been a one off affecting only one model out of dozens of different models/manufacturers while both device bricking issues found in recent iPhones in error 53 and touch disease affected a much smaller base of phones and just one manufacturer . All the other minor issues you mentioned, be they real or exaggerated, are also very similar to minor issues various iPhones have faced as well its just that it's even worse for iPhones because there are so few models from one manufacturer(and they're still worse) vs several dozens models from over a dozen different manufacturers. That's how bad iPhones are when they have more serious issues despite producing so few models. Issues with Android phone should dwarf those of iPhones by a huge margin considering how many models /manufacturers are involved but they don't, the iPhones still manage to be worse! It's mind boggling when you think about but that's how bad Apple quality is these days. Jon Puhl My 6P is absolutely absurd. It shuts down as high up as 51%, and almost always when the battery percentage is lower than 30%. I'm really upset about this, because it's Google's last Nexus flagship, and it can't even last a full two years without having this dumb battery problem. Daniel Orchard I got a full refund for my 6p, and bought a pixel xl, was out of pocket a little for the upgrade but device was just out of warranty so im still happy with the outcome. Props to Google store support. Yeah i still l got charged the pixel while waiting for the refund, took about 2 weeks to come through but they organised the return shipping etc just like an rma. Im actually really happy. Mine would shutdown between 15-30% and i only lived with that for 2 weeks before starting the process of fixing it. Yes it happened after moving to 7.0 and yes rolling back to 6.x did not fix it so im convinced its software, nfi why they havent rolled out a fix yet. I suggest doing the same because all replacement n6p are still vulnerable to the bug afaik. Morenicano Just wanna make sure I follow, You saying you had your 6P for more than a year and they authorized a refund? I ask because I just reached them for an exchange but if I can get a refund and upgrade to the Pixel, I'll do it. Morenicano Just a heads up, JUST I contacted Google through the support tab in the settings of my 6P and they warranty replaced both mine and my wife's 6P and we bought them through Project Fi in November 2015 with no extended warranty. They said it's a known issue and setup the replacement with no problem and it has next (business) day shipping for the new one and you send the old one back once you have the new one up and running. They do put a hold for the value of the phone on your card while they wait for the old one to come back but they don't charge you Cory Wilson Crybabies. Seriously, my phone developed the issue last week, contacted Google, now I'm rocking a brand new Nexus 6p. Luckily I happened to be on the last day of my warranty but I also got protect so even if I was out of warranty I wasn't paying another $500 again. Just call Google instead of your lawyers dumb asses Packer Backer Wow, a snowflake playing Internet tough guy. Brandon Andrews I had my Nexus 6P become bricked by the bootloop issue. I bought my phone through Best buy and was still well within my 1 year manufacturer warranty when the problem occurred. Unfortunately when I called Best buy customer service and asked how to take care of the situation they told me to send it to this company called Jeg & Sons to get the problem reviewed and a replacement. Needless to say there was like a month long ordeal of mix ups with this company before they finally sent my phone back and told me they don't deal with my phone. Finally I eventually figured out I needed to send my phone to Huawei and they replaced my phone no problem. Sarah Despars I've never had this issue with my 6p so far. Hopefully it doesn't start! k_nonymous I experience this exact same problem and it drives me nuts. Battery saver mode on my 6P is supposed to be activated at 15% battery. The phone shuts off before it ever gets to that point. Also, 95% battery life is equivalent to 1h 5m???? Packer Backer Well well, according to thereasoner he thinks it's your fault. gparmar76 This is 100% hardware related...If it was the OS, it would be a widespread issue across all Android 7 handsets...Huawei is using cheap batteries... People who like the phone should go buy a replacement from a company like Zero Lemon (if available)..Or just buy another stock battery. Kirkster My Nexus 6P is 11 months old, and so far the only anomaly I've had is that it spontaneously factory-reset while in my pants pocket about two weeks ago, which was annoying. I recovered from the cloud backup, which restored all my apps, settings, etc, and my photos were set to back up to Google photos. I lost my call log and SMS messages though, but luckily most of my messaging is via WhatsApp (which restored everything). Still, annoying. I now have a SMS+call log app installed in case it happens again. No battery problems *yet*, now I'm dreading the one-year mark, after reading all the comments. Chalet_Badger My 6P bootloops, i can get it to start normally when the battery is ~5% or so but it will freeze and start to bootloop about a minute or two after. Duane I've had no issue with my 6p. Sounds like an annoying issue from the comments here. Robert B I've been having this problem for a few months now...I carry external battery around all the time because you never know when it feels like it's going to shut off and not turn back on Packer Backer According to thereasoner, it's your fault. clarence jones My 6p did not have the random shutdown at a certain percent issue before. After the 7.1.2 update it would crash and restart when the camera app was opened. About two days after the update it started boot looping and nothing i have tried has gotten it to successfully boot again. Packer Backer Tell thereasoner because he thinks it's your fault. Spudos Woah I thought this was just me. My ending battery life varies wildly, sometimes dying at 15% and on bad days dying around 40-50%. I would replace the battery myself but the teardown process looks like it requires an electrical engineering degree. Packer Backer thereasoner thinks it's your fault. Maybe you should straighten him out. Đức Thành Maybe Google deserves to be sued. Kyle Zess I am plagued by this issue. My phone shutdown after 5 minutes of non charging use. Packer Backer thereasoner thinks it's your fault. David Vogt Only time mine would shut down early at 30% or less is if I was out in freezing cold weather, phone just didn't like freezing weather, keep it warm and it's fine blueman24 Just admit it that your "quick charge" bs killed the battery early. Truth hurts huh My Nexus 6p 128 was barely a year old and it never recovered from the bootloop issue where it would keep restarting and not getting past the Google screen then restart over and over, losing precious pictures and videos of my children. My sister's Nexus 5 eventually broke from the bootloop issue 3 months later. We both had the $80 warranty but it seemed unfair having to pay for a replacement REFURBISHED Nexus 6p when the damage was caused by bad software. Sucked how although Nexus/Google/Huwei knew of ongoing repeated problems a 6 -9 months earlier, yet FAILED to try to resolve or prevent the recurring boot loop issue from infecting more phones. Finally, a lawsuit is in place. Damani Boyce After 7.1.1 update my Nexus 6p got bootloop an can't be fixed shame on them not even a reply from Google or Huawei. thereasoner Many on here are saying that they had no problem getting it fixed/replaced. Packer Backer Yeah, it's ALL his fault.... Posts like yours make some people dream of twisting your head off. thereasoner Why would you say it's his fault? Smoking one to many fatties?, Lol. Razed Mine currently dies at around 10%. I use it moderately and have had it since launch. Got Nexus Protect, but that seems worthless as all reports are that using that service will just get me an even worse battery. thereasoner My Pixel has been great, I'll have to ask a friend at work about his 6p to see if he's having issues. By the sounds of it only a small percentage of devices are affected. Packer Backer Nexus 6 by Motorola was a better direction. Gordon Mine would shut off at 25% consistently. I called Huawei and they actually replaced the battery for free. I had to pay for shipping 1 way, but the covered the rest. I got my phone December 2015, and it was just replaced this February. ThEGr33k Which country? Gordon Canada Trey Bradshaw I haven't encountered any bootlooping and my phone doesn't shut off unless my battery drops to about 2%. olivrstal happens to my 6p quite a bit as well :( hope it's gonna make it till the pixel 2 comes out :D mrjoeyloke My wife just got the bootloop of death on her 6p. I think that might be a whole different issue though. Kuldeep Choudhary This happens when a gaint company like google hires a Chinese company to manufacture it's top line product. I'm using my motorola nexus 6 for 2.5 years and still not a single problem im facing and decided to keep it for 1 more year. Omar Al Matar Had the problem, I was out of warranty, called them, no frustration or arguments, 5 minutes i had the email to get my new phone, and i sent them the one i had, i was even out of the country. Now I got it to last me another year, so idk about y'all Kristen Oliver This happened with me until I replaced the battery... At my own cost. Funnily enough that is not a software issue 12321 Please click the links below for details of my experience, which is echoed by thousands of other Nexus 6P owners.

Sue them! Merxury My Nexus 6p died, it stuck at bootloop every time when I turn on my phone. Sara Bales I've had the Huawei Nexus 6P since July of 2016, purchased new in the box. It started randomly shutting down within weeks, often multiple times a day. It was annoying and inconvenient, even shutting down once when I was on a 911 call reporting an intruder in the garage (talk about chaos. . . I had to wait for it to reboot and call again). My phone entered the "boot loop of death" the last week of March. The first 6 or so crashes, it rebooted just fine. But then it started getting hung up on the rainbow google animations, until finally it wouldn't even push past the Google screen. I was able to pull up the barcodes but other system reboots were useless. Since my phone is still under warranty, Huawei agreed to repair it but I had to wait 5 days for a label from UPS. It's been almost 3 weeks and I've heard nothing. They also didn't offer to send a loaner phone. At least mine was under warranty, I see on the forum that Google and Huawei have refused to help and neither want to accept responsibility. Ron Nguyen My 6p shutdown prematurely everyday but at different battery percentages. Mostly around 30%, but I have had 40, 50s and 60. Anunnaki A battery replacement fixes the early shutdown problem. Sriidhar sriidhar My 6p died couple of weeks ago and Google and Huawei must be sued for not taking the responsibility, I'm a student and I saved a lot of money to buy the phone but now they're like, it's not our concern as you're out of warranty! Konstigt2 Very good, they should have issued a recall and fixed them all. To not have your phone avail when you need it in case of emergency could be fatal. I have gotten my battery and screen replaced and that fixed it for me. arpit saxena My 6p shutdown few months back, after bootloop and hasn't been turned on since them. Both companies failed to address the situation and to fix the fault Huawei asks for 400$. I don't seem to find any kind of Justice in this area. David Berry All you poor nexus folks hot rolled. High price.shite processor thats had issues in every phone its been put in & sealed in battery copping quick charge for 12months through then the new usbc port then add that to the Chinese manufacturer &issues that causes with returns & you have a massive recipie for disaster. So is your nexus 6p still beter than an s7e or note5or7?Maybe the little fire issue puts it on a par with note 7 just but with that 810 inside it was always doomed from the start. No wonder they canned it for the now overpriced pixel. I think id rather a umi z plus for under half the price. So wheres the samsung haters now? I hate them too but they do make the best phones once you tweak this & that & set it up right. My note5 died after 18 months too. It did cop a real hammering as a wifi hotspot for a while there though. It used to get real hot with a few people connected at once & my bro never let it rest & would run it hot & flat every day. Sometimes 2x a day so it was to be expected. I got 2 note 7s for Sweet f%$ck all & a free s7e from samsung so ill forgive them a little & send back my note5 in the fire proof box & keep the other note 7 as a spare & as compensation for losing all my music &stuff on the note5& the fiasco of the n7recall. Sealed in batteries suck unless you replace your phone every 18months. Boy Ling Mine shuts down at 33% maybe 8 Times out of 10. I never updated to android 7. Mandeep Singh Pannu Mine normally dies off at 30%, then I connected it to charge, it comes back on at 30%.... Also I live up north in the UK, and at early in the morning, if I go out, and it's too cold it just dies randomly theadamsegal Very disappointed with Google. My Nexus 6P started shutting off at around 20% less than a year after I purchased it. The basically pulled an Apple with the release of the Pixel. After purchasing 3 Nexus phones in 4 years, I won't be buying a Google handset again. Ashwini Kumar Same issue here. Phone dies suddenly at 10-15% without any warnings. I love the phone but battery is pathetic. I barely get 10 hours on light usage. I hate apple but the 6s plus from work would be at 50% battery at the end of the day. First google deserted the nexus brand and then not honouring the issue. Disappointed! Sean Stone I'm currently replying from my just received RMA replacement for the boot loop issue. My warranty was technically up in November but the Google Tech Support hooked me up anyway. Better outcome than I was expecting. Thomas Boel Mine shut's down at round about 20%, but only when the screen is turned on! The warning comes and immediately it starts shutting down. Maggie Smith I don't get any warning. It just reboots at random. I wish I did get a warning. David Schleifstein Shuts down at 15% for me, closer to 30% for my wife's. I also noticed that a short time in colder temperatures can cause the battery to drop dead at 50% and up. Ger PG How is this affecting users? David McFee Same issue. Daily premature shutdown. So annoying. Jon Watts Get a grip people. It's just a phone. If it doesn't work just get a new one. I've had the 6P since its release in 2015. Yes I've had a few issues but nothing that didn't eventually get fixed. Dirge Yeah, all those thousands of people that suffer from this problem better just get a grip. So Google sold a defective product, so what? Go buy another one. Duh. "I'm not having any problems therefore these people need to get their shit together." *Rolls eye's* Drew Harden https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/fff14c9ec4b9b4966ae37554f13b373d9bfa270aa644c3e5ef01a5fca3723410.png Mine usually shuts down when the phone is pretty cold and then I turn the screen on and then it just dies. In the warmer weather it still dies with 15% every time though. If I start a Snapchat video below 20% it's instantly off. Dan Molina I haven't had a shut down at 60% but I get it at 25% pretty consistently. Bootloop is rare too; however, I do get random restarts usually while on a phone call. Danny Mestriner Good, maybe they will finally get off their lazy asses and treat us like actual customers. I also have the shutdown issue since Nougat. Philip Quach I've had the same issue even after factory reset. It's especially bad when the temperature outside is cold. I'm really disappointed with Huawei and Google about this. Artūras Rimonis Having the same issue. It always shuts down at 15% or even more. Cara Buttitta sometimes mine dies at 20% sometimes at 60%. just today my 6p was at 90%, I took one picture without the flash and it shut down. very frustrating David Perez Yes, it's been an issue since nougat, from what I recall. Both Nexus 6p devices I have suffered from increased battery drain, and sudden shutdown anywhere from 15 to 25%. Google points to Huawei, Huawei points to Google. I downgraded one device back to marshmallow. Battery drain is still pronounced, but at least no shutdown. I get my warning at 15% and can run until the single digits. John Adams Will die between 20-35% every time, also randomly restarts at around 50%. This phone has been plagued with bugs since release... Jordan Hindley https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/0aef98131463828edbc4ecec53b90938738636b0a4ab26649126e2b51247d48d.png My device shuts down at lots of different battery percentages and won't reboot until i attach to a power source. It's a nightmare. MeanBeans I get that all the time as well even after I changed the battery Mike I Easy. Have Google make their own phones. Call them, oh, Pixel? I'm writing this on my lg5x with 7.1.2. Very happy with it, but will take 200 off coupon on the LG g6 against any and all future 5x claims. Seiga Is it safe to say I should utilize my Nexus protect? I too am suffering from this issue. CJ Nexus 6p start shutting down with 1 to 2 times a day, which increase to more than 10 times within 3 month..huwaei and Google blaming each other for issues..phone is under warranty, but can't do anything.. Miresnare Love my 6p. Never had an issue with it apart from the slo-mo on the camera. Wonderful device. Rob Paek My 6P shut off abruptly right after it gave me the 15% warning the other day. Other than that it has been freezing lately and forcing me to reboot. lance colton Suing is great and all, but every AMERICAN class action lawsuit does absolutely nothing for those of us that aren't in the USA. All the times Nvidia and Sony got sued for stuff they sold me that didn't work as advertised, I'm entitled to NOTHING. This phone is such garbage. Just got it back from the bootloop repair, and the battery starts dying at 20% left. Then 40%. Yesterday, 60%. WTF. I don't think it's Google's fault, though. They would have fixed the software if they can by now. More like Huawei built this thing out of garbage, so it actually needs to be replaced after a year. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/776a4957bbcf9a86578fe290eba3107f160fabf3d0d520adb81993f61d67cca0.png You wouldn't believe the trouble I had getting this thing in for repairs either. I bought it from my carrier so I can't deal with Google or Huawei. They do troubleshooting but for warranty I have to deal with 'Freedom mobile'. I have to go into a certain shopping mall and go to a specific kiosk that is a designated repair center. They refused to honor the terms of the warranty, specifically that the original bootloop repair gives me 90 days more warranty. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/735c6d189c2684ae884f4c97c0d443766058dfa8c7119577c26c17b6da30b031.png Even the Huawei website says it's under warranty for a few more days. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/63182bf80270d912f90486d64178eff22d06e6ef98c0bbc1b1c6fcad3b6f4c62.png I had to give up at the kiosk, go to my car, and phone 611. Talked to an idiot that wastes my time with irrelevant troubleshooting, then she tries to tell me the warranty is expired too. Ask for a supervisor. Same story, but she speaks better English. I argue with her that they need to honor the terms on their website, but she says I'm not understanding them. I refuse to give up, she finally places me on hold for 5 min, comes back, admits I'm correct. I still have 3 days warranty according to her now. She puts a note on the account, then I go back to the kiosk, tell the guy there to read the note and finally he calls his manager, and figures out how to process the claim. If they didn't glue the stupid thing together, I'd replace the battery myself. They choose to make it un-repairable, they can fix it. Cindy Up until the April 2017 update, I was experiencing this same issue. My Nexus 6P would die with as much as 23% battery life left. oscar acevedo Oh that explains why my phone unexpectedly shuts down from time to time. Nexus 6P v7.1.2 blenderboy People still buy google devices like Pixel. Consumers vote with their money. The moment you buy a device you are promoting the brand. I don't think there will be any outcome for this lawsuit. This is just a publicity stunt. Samsung hardware is great, software is shit. Google software is ok but hardware partners do not work properly with Google(initial supply, firmware updates, warranty replacements). I am waiting for Pixel(maybe in 2 yrs) after seeing how current Pixel owners are treated by Google. Apple hardware is great, software works as expected. I use Linux at home and without itunes it is difficult to use a iPhone. So only option for me is Android. Charles Jordan I have the Nexus 6P a lotnd I have no issues and it's all updated. ThEGr33k Sent mi e of for RMA in the UK they did a "software update" to android 7 and sent it back. Safe to say the early shutdown and terrible battery life is still here... Have sent an email asking for the battery to be replaced so see what i hear back... Felipe I had my 6P fallen into the bootloop problem, I was given a replacement as Huawei honored its 15 months warranty (even though the documentation everywhere says it has 12 months factory warranty, it in fact has 15 months, with Huawei, but NOT with Google, shame Google!). Now, I'm about to get this replacement unit and pray, really pray hard that nothing new appears with this phone. Even tough there are now reports of replaced phones crashing again into the bootloop bug and, recently that Android 7.1.2 final, screwed the fingerprint sensor. Many are not liking the way Google+Huawei (yes, both) is handling this crisis, which in fact is a major one. I think customers who spent lots of hard earned money should get a quality device which keeps on working well, even after its warranty period expired and, wheren there is a well known massive problem, the manufacturer(s) Hardware+Software should honor fixes or reimburses, despite the fact that there are now the Pixels phones. If my replacement phone fails, I'd be more than willing to participate in a class action suit. Jacob Kraniak I thought I was going crazy when I noticed my 6P constantly rebooting on it's own. At least now I know I'm not alone with htis issue. Hopefully they give us something back in return. Maybe a replacement? Hell, I'd rather just return it at this point and use whatever credit they give me towards a Pixel or OP3T. that's not to say I haven't loved the 6P of course. Alexander Dumo Ive had this issue since updating my 6P sometime this past December. We shouldn't have to live with charging our phone before it hits approx 15%-20% battery life. When that warning pops up, the phone just shuts down. Make no sense...please fix this Huawei/Google! Charles Constantine I reported shutdowns at battery levels of 20-60 percentage remaining and was given a list of things to do including a "factory reset" and then told to report back by Google Project fi support. ARDankar I am glad I did not upgrade to nougat yet. Keep me posted on any news regarding issues with the Nexus 6P. David Droddy The Goog replaced my 6P very quickly when I demonstrated the sudden shut down problem even in safe mode and after full factory reset. Why would you report that Google is not responsive to this issue? Seanmiz Yep, I've experienced both issues on my 6P. I got hit with the bootloop of death a few months ago, luckily still under warranty with Huawei and got a replacement. I get the early battery shutdown usually in the 10-20% range. prwnd https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/cd48abb593ae6c1dd226cbe06ba45cf7195abd40318303b2290ca9229846939e.png Biojoe Me too. Travis Coble Oddly enough, sometimes it shuts down early, and sometimes it's fine. However, given my use of it and constant recharging, I'm convinced that this will end up going nowhere because the problem is actually pretty normal for devices that are going on two years of age due to the use of LIon batteries. People claiming shutdown at 60%? I'd need to see it to believe it... maverick7526 https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/3b98bc27cfb84fed5d59d503e403949c6d1cd50a18f37dd23dc58235aba80ad6.png It happens. It happened to me in Feb. It was very cold out and the phone just shut off, and would not turn on again until it was plugged into a charger. Brett Crowley Mine just hit a random boot loop and recovery mode is not working. Hussain Ahmadi I really hope they sue google for this. 6P keeps restarting without any reason, not to forget the excessive freezing issues. Google is getting very arrogant and need some spanking Hussain Ahmadi And of course this will be the last phone I've ever buy from google. Waiting eagerly for Note 8 mercado79 Yes, both issues. The battery issue was covered under warranty directly by Google. The bootloop issue occurred 1 month out of warranty and both companies told me there​ was nothing they could do for me. Marcin Nowak I had this issue since beginning of the year and Google forums just said wait for update. Finally contacted Google about it just last week feed up asking for help and they told me to F.off pretty much. zefred Got it. It started RIGHT after the one year mark. Contacted google AND Huawei, and was turned down by both. My N6p doesn't even last half a day with recharging. I need to carry extra external batteries everywhere with me, as well as a charge and cable, and the device is barely a year and a half old. NOT a happy camper :( 12321 Law360, Dallas (April 17, 2017, 5:29 PM EDT) -- Google Inc. and Huawei Technologies USA Inc. were hit with a putative class action in Texas federal court Friday over an allegedly defective smartphone, the Nexus 6P, which the user claims suffers from premature battery drainage. Plaintiff Alex Gorbatchev wants to represent a class of consumers who bought the Google Nexus 6P phones, which he says also suffer from a problem that sends the phone into a “death spiral” in which the phones suddenly switch off and then restart in what is referred to as an... https://www.law360.com/texas/articles/913933/class-hits-google-with-suit-over-defective-nexus-phones https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Bad-Cellphones.pdf Claude L Now it's getting worst with android 7.1.2. I was also experiencing early shutdown with my 6p when using 7.1.1. But now I'm unable to use my phone on a daily basis without having a early shutdown. Today again battery was at 20% and last week it happened at 37%. I was so happy when I bought my phone a year and a half ago because I was able to use it for the whole day without having to charge the battery... Now I have to carry a charger with me... It sucks theadb Anything we can do in Canada? Mine just shuts off randomly all the time. This is was a RMA from an older 6P that had massive battery issues. The guy I just spoke to said my original warranty was up in January this year and there was nothing he could do. This phone shuts down randomly all the time now. I've missed by alarm to wake up twice now because it just shuts off. Only way to power it back on is to go into bootloader and restart. adi sararu mine had his 20% dying today first time... and after reading above... my time to never touch google phones again :D Steve I had same battery problem with my 6p, rather than taking out a lawsuit against Google I just purchased a new battery and replaced it. Phone no longer has the issue, lawsuit closed Kyle Snider Phone shuts off early on me allllllll the time, does this lawsuit affect us in Canada? Adam Macias I'm suffering the premature battery death. I have yet to cross the boot loop issue though.

Some Pixel phones are having problems with backups, Google is looking into it Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/04/20 10:35am PDTApr 20, 2017 22 Plus 1 on G+ 14 Share on Facebook 42 Share on Twitter Total Shares78 Bug Watch Google News Pixel Pixel XL Some users have been experiencing issues with backup on Google's Pixel devices, most notably backups of SMS, call history, and apps, although other accounts of all backup types failing have also been reported.  The current cause isn't known, but reports of the problem on Google's product forums stretch back to just after the launch of the device, and for many the matter remains unresolved. Even one of Google's support specialists discovered he was experiencing the issue, but apart from reaching out to those affected for bug reports no information has been publicly provided. To be clear, for those with the problem their personal data in one or more categories may not be being backed up as they would expect. Not to be alarmist, but with this backup error occurring silently, it might be prudent for Pixel users to check that their devices are, in fact, performing their backups as expected and intended. To check for yourself, navigate to Settings, Backup and Reset, Backup and see if any of the items listed under Content are "Waiting to backup." If you are among those suffering the problem you might want to exercise some caution and consider another backup method for whatever might be failing for you. Also, feel free to add your voices (and log-files) down at Google's product forums. They're currently reaching out to those affected there for additional information, and with more data the issue can probably be fixed that much more quickly.

Gustavo Me too, also only seeing it in Call History on my Pixel teh Jax At least the important ones are working fine! Andrew same here Ryne Hager That's not a huge deal, then. Not the worst thing to lose if your phone eats it. Photos or SMS could be a bigger problem, though. teh Jax Right. If somebody is experiencing this bug with other pieces of data, this is a big deal! If this is all it is, hardly anybody is going to care. And those that do care probably should be using multiple forms of backup anyway. Sachin Bahal Same here Suicide_Note Same. That's the only one that had any issue on my device. steb0ne Same here... So most people in this comment section who actually have Pixel devices seem to be having the same issue with the call history not backing up and a bunch of trolling by other people talking about how it's plagued with bugs, lol! Got it! I wonder how long it's been acting up... Everything else shows backed up this morning. If this is a daily backup and it didn't backup one day is this really that big of a deal? The screenshot posted shows December... I'm curious to know is this a Google feature or Pixel feature? Can someone else with a phone running Nougat confirm if theirs is backing up? teh Jax Definitely a lot of trolling and ignorance going on in these comments. That's pretty typical by people commenting about a premium device that they either can't buy or chose not to buy - it helps them justify their situation. Which is fine by me. It's rare that comments are actually insightful. ¯_(ツ)_/¯ teddyfrozevelt Mine hasn't backed up since I factory reset it in december. Everything else has backed up. Impulse_Vigil It's an Android feature, has been forever, but O and the Pixel are the first places where it's status has been exposed and broken down by category. So it may or may not be working elsewhere, you wouldn't really know. Now freak out! Heh... steb0ne That's what I thought... So it's possibly happening on other non Pixel devices. The article made it seem Pixel specific CJ Me too. Maxr1998 Same for me, Nexus 6P, O Preview. Also had that issue for SMS & apps after I clean-flashed the update, but I could at least fix the latter by manually running "bmgr backupnow --all" in a su shell. SMS somehow resolved itself it seems. Impulse_Vigil Same, everything else is backed up, didn't even know call history could be backed up. 4Ui812 Better call Saul. Bat Man 1 day = 1 problem? 4Ui812 Nausea, heartburn, indigestion, upset stomach, diarrhea.... Google's quality control is hard at work. Middlefinger Yeah, but at least it gets 'Timely updates' /s Phalkon30 Just bought my 6p 2 weeks ago, not a single thing moved to it from my previous device. It's like I never had a Google history, even though I have app backups on my Google Drive. I even tried to to set up from another device, it gave an unknown error and moved nothing I'm going to have to root to fix it, awful backup solution sproc I think it only works with the same phone honestly, cause otherwise I bet no one uses it sadly. Tiuri Elvander Sent in my 6p for an RMA, it was fully backed up. Tried to restore the backup on my replacement 6p but it only offered my One plus One (which I used while I was waiting for my replacement). The whole thing lasted less than a week, yet my original backup was not available as an option to restore. Very annoying!! Jordan VanCampen Same here. My work phone which is a Moto z play stopped working. I got a replacement and thought that I'd be able restore it from the previous one, but nope. The setup process only gave me the option to restore from my Vizio tablet that came with my TV that I recently bought. My pixel that is my personal phone wasn't an option. So I decided that I would use the NFC option. So I I did that with my pixel and it didn't restore anything at all. The backup situation on Android is still pretty much a dumpster fire. Ryne Hager I've had the restore from previous device thing bug out as well, I usually just set everything up as a new device now. blindexecutioner $800 device running never-ending beta software. Jingwei Zhang It does backup a lot of settings for many apps. As for games, if the game requires logging in, it backs up the log in information if you had it set as memorized. It also memorizes the layout of the apps. The backup is definitely not the best, but it's automatic and much more comprehensive than the native backup other manufacturers provide, including ios. Roy Hm, no. I used an iphone and ipod touch ages ago and they actually have a backup solution that works. When you restore, it's like you never left - even between devices. Even Blackberry had a better backup system than Android ever has - the only decent backup solution Android has is Titanium backup (which is, to be fair, excellent), and that requires root so most people are SOL. I've never even had my wifi settings restored properly, even though that's supposedly backed up. Jingwei Zhang Hm, no. We have six iPhones in the family and none of them backup like you said here (like you never left). However, my Nexus to Pixel transfer was like that. All apps, photos, sms and etc were restored to the same position and most pertinent settings were restored. IIRC, the phone even restored my company's WIFI setting with the correct credential. I don't know which android phone you have, but Google's backup does some pretty amazing things for requiring absolutely no maintenance on the user's side. EDIT: I just remembered. My sister and mom actually use Google Photo on their iPhone 6S/7 because it's free and easy as opposed to the tiny iCloud storage. JohnyNoLegs Its free when it compresses your photos. Also iPhone does whole phone backup, android does not. Also if you lose your pixel right now, you are screwed, as you can't do a transfer. Jingwei Zhang IIRC Pixel has full photo backup without any compression. I believe I specifically said that it does some amazing things with absolutely no user side maintenance. You can always do a manual full backup with titanium or in recovery. Root and unlocked bootloader are needed, but that's just takes a few minutes with Nexus and Pixel. How is that? Everything is automatically backed up including video, pic and sms, call history and etc on a daily basis. I would wager that you can retrieve more current information from a lost Pixel/Nexus than from a lost iPhone if they were both lost and went completely off the grid. JohnyNoLegs Wager away, then send me the money. iPhone does a bit for bit backup, it backs up the current state of the whole iPhone. Google does not do this. Google selectively backs up items like call history, sms etc. Pixel is the only Android phone that offers uncompressed backup for free, not really an option for everyone mate. Titanium backup is for ROOT LOLOLOLOL. Recovery is for unlocked devices LOLOLOLOLOL iPhone does complete backup with any hacking required, talk about no user side maintenance! BTW, my Pixel stopped backup up photos, it's a bug. Doesn't sound like no user maintenance required haha Jingwei Zhang hmm comparing full backup that can take upwards of an hour to one that runs in the background huh? You definitely understand what no user maintenance is and are certainly brilliant. Comparing apple to orange as long as it suits your narrative. Are we talking about any other android phone? I don't think so. Unlocking bootloader and granting root access are considered hacking now? Bugs and failures happen, just like how two of our iPhone 6 bricked just out of warranty. Also, my Pixel is not experiencing this bug, so it's not a problem for me (yet). JohnyNoLegs Think logically for a second mate. You are talking a out no user maintenance. IPhone does full backups while you sleep. Android does not. To root your phone and unlock the bootloader requires user maintenance. Impulse_Vigil I do think iOS backup functionality is more comprehensive, it doesn't leave things up to individual devs either... OTOH it does gobble up a pretty decent amount of storage on accounts where people often end up having to pay extra for... Nothing is perfect. JohnyNoLegs It's true, but for the person who just wants their stuff backed up, IOS has it covered much better than android. Even the simplicity of setting up iCloud to do everything is great. In Android it is a bit all over the shop in deep settings and different apps. I'm fine with Androids implementation, but then again I don't care about doing factory resets etc which is kinda the nature of android. iPhone users perhaps are less used to having to restore their data all the time. Ryne Hager I think it backs up some appdata, like Netflix login information carrying over to new devices, that sort of thing. JohnyNoLegs After an RMA and a few factory resets, I can tell you it hasn't in my case. Impulse_Vigil It can do that, but apps need to be written for it, backup has always been a joke on Android but it's largely because devs ignore the existing tools tbh. Killa I'm not seeing any option on my Nexus 6 in the Backup & Reset area that shows the breakout of the different backup content like it does in the image above. There's just the On/Off switch and language that says backups are in Google Drive...etc. Is this only a Pixel thing or higher version of Android? Phalkon30 Must be a pixel thing, I don't see it on my 6P either, and I'm on 7.1.2 Cyan Thayn It's also an O thing apparently, have the exact menu shown in the screenshots on my 6P on the O preview (and have the same bugs as well!). Ryne Hager It's a pixel thing, no need to worry. Impulse_Vigil I'm not even sure what the point is, I guess extra info and transparency (which is good), because none of those options really do anything but tell you what's being backed up. There's nothing to toggle besides the main backup option and the option to backup to Drive. Shoot, other phones could be suffering the same issues but because the backup status isn't displayed nobody would know! On my Pixel everything but call history is up to date, and I couldn't care less about that. Ishimaru Another day, another Pixel issue. Ramon Google is fucking up a lot lately. What's taking so long to fire some people? Just not just lately Conrad Okay, so what happened to the review of the Synology 416play? I'd really like to read it! lomsha Some premium device lol. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Once again, I told you so. You should really run a daily series called "Google Screwup Of The Day". Ryne Hager Your name is amazing. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Not many people get it. ;) J.J. Pixel and problem are two words heard often lately! Leif Sikorski Same with previous Nexus and some other Google Hardware devices. It's one reason why I'm glad that other OEMs update slower these days. Google keeps giving me the impression that they still see their devices as geeky developer devices where the user does the final testing. If they want to be more serious with their hardware efforts and compete with the big brands they need to invest much more money into testing and customer support. Ryne Hager Eh, bugs happen with any tech, and the volume of problems has gotten a lot smaller than things used to be back in the day. Progress has its pitfalls, is all. Nick I'm with you here. I get that people expect nothing but excellence from a device that they paid a pretty penny for, but stuff happens sometimes and so far it hasn't been anything that warrants the level of indignation I am seeing here in the comment section. I'm sure Google will fix the issue as soon as they possibly can. JohnyNoLegs And by progress, you mean they haven't really done anything different right? Still the same updates with bugs, still take ages to fix anything. I am still having the worst bluetooth experience of any phone I have owned, and that's after an RMA already! Anon Now we know why the pixel includes 24/7 support. Lisarbeams Managing director of Google!, is explaining to users to start off "Work at home" method, that People have been doing for about one year now.

Let's see what the bug list for the S8 looks like six months down the line! Phil We're already on a pink screen and what's it been? 2 weeks? I've not heard any reports of exploding Pixels so far at least. Most of the people trolling these articles are Sammy Knights who should know better. I'm looking forward to seeing what problems the S8 has over the next 6 months. By the way, is Bixby's working yet? Mike Bastable The Pixel handsets seen to be agreeing poorly... Lot of bugs recently... Sachin Bahal no device will ever be perfect, there will always be some issue(s) during a device's life cycle, and it just so happens that the Pixel's issues/bugs are happening 6 months into the phone's life cycle Ryne Hager Yeah, I expect they'll probably get things fixed. Bugs happen. Sachin Bahal The Pixel is just crawling with bugs ;) Hussain Ahmadi And some go on to call this crap as best Android phone? A big joke and Google has made a really big joke of itself by releasing this iAndroid phone!! Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ The Pixel is STILL listed as the Best Android Phone on most sites, despite all the problems, the halos in the pictures, etc. Even though I NEVER thought it deserved that status, I can understand that most of its problems surfaced after web magazines rated it. But it's clear now that the phone sucks and its software sucks. If publishing had any integrity, they'd issue a correction, revoke that title and make some other phone the best phone of 2016. Impulse_Vigil Or most of the problems aren't really as wide spread as some seem to believe, I've had pretty much no issues with mine. Marty I had a Google backup issue on my OP3T. I factory wiped it after an update and the restore function usually seen during set up didn't appear. YaKillaCJ Something about that picture just bugs me... Impulse_Vigil I see what you did there! Have a ^ Arcest Not new adb restore failed to re-install apk https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/37130390 Sir_Brizz Compromise free device. Actually getting tired of making this joke, which says something. Impulse_Vigil Compromise and bug free since Nov here. /shrug New_Guy Geez, they Pixel has so many issues, it's crazy... Phil This problem is only being reported by people enrolled on the beta testing of Android O ffs. Of course there are going to be bugs with am OS still in the testing stage. That's the whole point isn't it? Give people an early look in order that they can identify bugs and instabilities? The problem is not the phone, it a Dev version of an OS. Kevin Sword Loving your hero images Ryne! Mr.Bean ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ We're gonna need a can of Raid to squash these bugs. Muzaffar Don't mind the bugs, as long as it get stock android and latest update. ashjas Are these options only pixel specific..? I mean I don't see such backup options on my Nexus 4 with nougut custom rom? Impulse_Vigil Call history is waiting to be backed up here weird, everything else is current. I didn't even know my phone backed up call history tbh... Seems I've gotten ultra lucky with Pixel bugs, outside a handful of sporadic instances of Bluetooth turning off thru the start of the year I've avoided just about everything else. Got mine in November FWIW, tap on wood. Bala Same here since day one for SMS and call history ,it's funny when they say they are looking into. A feature that's supposed to work with final release is not working for a while and still they are looking Jan Machovec Is this something Pixel specific? Because I don't see any option to backup SMS, Call log and others on my SGS7.

Communities North County Google gives Oceanside students crash course on internet safety Google gives Oceanside students crash course on internet safety Google web safety roadshow comes to Cesar Chavez Middle School in Oceanside.  Google web safety roadshow comes to Cesar Chavez Middle School in Oceanside.  Deborah Sullivan BrennanContact Reporter Two Google employees gave hundreds of Oceanside middle-school students an energetic crash course in digital dos and don’ts Thursday, stressing the permanent impact the Internet can leave on their lives. Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Vista) had invited the company to present its Google Online Safety Roadshow at Cesar Chavez Middle School in Oceanside, and the congressman also participated in the event. The program — which has been presented in 40 states — targets middle schoolers because that’s the point at which kids go from simply being viewers of online content to actors on its many platforms, said Google spokeswoman Catherine Williams. “Ninety-three percent of teens are online,” she said. “They’re moving from a more passive use of technology to an active one.” Using interactive games and pop culture examples, the event aimed to show students how their online activities can take them down unexpected paths, and how they can steer toward safer practices. Explaining that things students share online can reach up to three billion viewers, the presenters offered a physical example of a viral post. Google employee Clayton Hunter asked one student to look for a message under his chair, and then instructed other students to look for the message, simulating the way an online post can spread among viewers. The example in this case was a photo of a co-worker with french fries up her nose — arguably not the kind of thing middle-school students would choose to share with their classmates. Other portions of the presentation centered on setting a strong password, and keeping it secure. In that segment, Issa — who made his fortune by founding a successful auto alarm company and reviewed cyber security issues as chairman of the House Oversight Committee — competed with students in a game-show type contest to create a tough password. Following Google’s recommendation to mix up upper and lower-case letters, punctuation and numerals, Issa tied with a girl who challenged him in the first round, and narrowly beat a boy who played the second. The goal of the exercise, Issa said, is to keep kids on their guard in the digital realm. “We’re trying to get them to be suspicious in the cyber world, the way that they would at the mall (if) someone says ‘Come here, I’ve got candy,’” he said. The Google staff also warned that password security is only as good as the people who have access to it, citing statistics that one in three teens share their passwords with friends. “There’s lots of great things you can share with your friends,” presenter Jaquetta Gooden said. “But your password is not one of them.” Some students said they also appreciated the tip that they should change passwords for different websites. The presentation also covered phishing scams, reminding students not to respond to ads or e-mails requesting their passwords, identification or other personal information, no matter how tempting. “You don’t want to take offers that look too free or too good to be true, like a trip to Hawaii or free iPad,” Hunter said. The Google workers also urged students to be aware of their settings on social media platforms and other apps, and share their profiles only with those they trust. Alexis Villanueva, 13, said that was a helpful reminder, adding that he planned to go home and check his privacy settings that afternoon. Presenters summed up the assembly with a discussion of online etiquette, noting that the best way to avoid embarrassing or hurtful mistakes online is to be respectful as a matter of habit. “It was really neat,” said Kimberly Ontivors, 12, adding that the assembly offered “a lot of excitement and encouragement to be positive.” Three must-see headlines  Dumanis to resign July 7, mulls run for county board Petco not liable in fatal 'rat bite fever' case, jury says Zahau wrongful death suit narrowed to her boyfriend's brother    Dumanis to resign July 7, mulls run for county board Petco not liable in fatal 'rat bite fever' case, jury says Zahau wrongful death suit narrowed to her boyfriend's brother   See more videos deborah.brennan@sduniontribune.com Twitter@deborahsbrennan Copyright © 2017, The San Diego Union-Tribune Oceanside Should North Korea nuclear strikes worry California at all?

Whether you’re dodging through the narrow alleys of Kobe, Japan, or skimming Lake Achen in Austria, Google Earth offers rich 360-degree content, along with spectacular satellite imagery that can satiate any hunger for exploration. But Google went a step further this week with a major update that not only redesigned the interface, but also added rich textual and visual content from partners such as BBC Earth, NASA, and the Jane Goodall Institute. The new Voyager tab acts as a curated magazine that houses stories from these select partners, and it even features never before seen behind-the-scenes content from shows such as Planet Earth II. There’s also plenty of packaged content from the Google Street View team you can check out. Say goodbye to any other plans you had this weekend, as we explore all the new possibilities in the new Google Earth. This is home The first address most of us type when we see the blue marble floating in space is home. It’s why one of the highlights of the Culture category in the new Voyager tab is a series called “This is Home.” This series takes a look at some traditional homes of cultures and people most of us may not know much about. There are five homes you can visit at the moment: an Inuit Igloo, Bedouin tent, Reed House, Sherpa home, and Greenlandic Illoq. Tap on one and you’ll be taken to the geographical coordinates, with a brief description of the person and the area. There are usually three “cards” telling the story of the culture and the home — the first shows the satellite view, the second offers a Street View 360-degree image, and the third takes us into the home itself. Stories of more homes are on the way. This is Home Nature and wildlife Google Earth With the new Voyager tab, you can learn more about nature and wildlife than ever before. Partners include BBC Earth, the Jane Goodall Institute, the World Wildlife Fund, and The Ocean Agency, among others. What’s neat is that much of the content is from decades of back catalogs from these various agencies, and you can even find behind-the-scenes content that has yet to be aired — such as when the BBC Earth team found a Komodo dragon in their bathroom. A lot of this content includes videos you can watch in Google Earth, without needing to leave the site. Read More The Natural Treasures series, for example, lets you choose environments like “Islands,” “Mountains,” and “Jungles,” to explore. For example, if you choose Mountains, you’ll get a story describing major mountains and the surrounding area. Most of these have accompanying videos you can enjoy. “We’re trying to give viewers that deeper experience,” Chadden Hunter, a producer at the BBC Natural History Unit, told Digital Trends. “With this fully interactive tool, we’re hoping people will just explore for hours.” There’s a lot of content to sift through, as there’s more than a 100 assets from BBC Earth alone. You can check it all out by tapping on the Voyager icon on the left, and clicking on Nature. The view from space Julian Chokkattu/Digital Trends You can’t talk about Earth and satellite images without mentioning NASA, a partner with the new Google Earth. The space agency currently has two stories you can explore in Google Earth: “Scenes from Space” and “Reading the ABCs from Space.” The latter involves scrolling through the alphabet with geographical structures that look just like the letters — you’ll also find fun, quirky descriptions with each letter. “Scenes from Space” takes a look at gorgeous landscapes via satellite images, with a description and links to read more about what you’re seeing. To check out NASA Earth Observatory’s content, tap the Voyager icon, and head to Nature. Travel and history Google Earth Google already has Trips, an app you can use to plan your next vacation, but you can use the new Google Earth for this as well. The Travel tab in Voyager offers curated points of interest in major cities around the world, such as Paris, Tokyo, New York City, and more. If you choose to explore Paris, for example, you can find stories like “72 Hours in Paris: Day 1,” where you’ll see multiple points of interest to visit. The History tab seems to be more of an assortment of random stories from the Street View team and some other partners. The list here is small, but you can explore interesting pieces such as “The Hidden Worlds of the National Parks,” and “Lost Civilizations from Above.” A surprising Sesame Street tie-in Julian Chokkattu/Digital Trends Sesame Street is broadcast in more than 150 countries, reaching more than 156 million children around the world. The tie-in here is to provide educational content for children through the Muppets, who act as role models promoting education, good habits, respect, and understanding. The first story from Sesame Street on Google Earth is called “Girls Around the World,” and you’ll find aired content from 12 different co-productions in places such as Afghanistan and India. Tap on a country and children can learn a little about the place, meet the local Muppet, and even see the Muppet interviewing locals. There’s also a lot of content that’s told by kids, for kids. To find Sesame Street in Google Earth, tap on the Voyager icon on the left, tap on Culture, and find Sesame Street’s Girls Around the World. Expect more content to be added often. Sesame Street’s Girls Around the World Tips and tricks Julian Chokkattu/Digital Trends There are a few neat tricks in the new Google Earth you should know about. Firstly, if you have a Google Chromecast, you can cast to your TV. On Chrome, find the Cast icon on the top right and share your tab to a nearby Chromecast device. On Android, you’ll need to open the Google Home app, slide out the navigation drawer, and tap on Cast screen/audio.  There’s also a dice icon below Voyager on the sidebar — tap it to trigger “I’m Feeling Lucky,” where Google will take you to a random point in the world. You can bookmark any place you visit, and you can find these saved places in the My Places tab on the sidebar. You can also share a location with just a link. Tap the Share icon in the sidebar and you can either copy the link to your clipboard, or share it directly to Facebook, Twitter, and Google+. Immerse yourself to the max in VR Google Earth VRMore Got an Oculus Rift or an HTC Vive? The Google Earth VR app is now available on both platforms, and it allows you to fly to anywhere in the world. You can take cinematic tours, visit featured places, and even move the position of the sun to transform the place you’re in from day to night. You can grab the app from the Oculus store here, and you can find it on Steam for the HTC Vive. Google told Digital Trends that Voyager content will regularly be updated with partners. The new Google Earth is available on Android and the Google Chrome browser. An iOS version is in the works, and the company is looking to bring the experience to other browsers as well.

Life & Style Books New book 'Move Fast and Break Things' takes on Amazon, Facebok, Google Google Virginia Mayo / AP 2010 Google’s cavalier disregard for copyright laws are also well-documented. Google’s cavalier disregard for copyright laws are also well-documented. (Virginia Mayo / AP 2010) Nick Romeo America's major tech companies like to present themselves as cool and countercultural institutions. Their employees and executives wear jeans to work, hold "hackathons" to solve problems and speak in soaring language of how their "disruptive innovations" will positively transform the world. How could these companies not be a force for good? Jonathan Taplin's excellent new book explains exactly how Google, Facebook and Amazon are undermining democratic institutions, accelerating the rise of oligarchy in America, and destroying both cultural and economic opportunities for millions of people. The book's title is "Move Fast and Break Things," a slogan popular in Silicon Valley that has gradually gained a set of connotations far less flattering than tech oligarchs might realize. As Taplin writes, "a culture and its art are not like an old flip phone — to be thrown in the trash as soon as it has been 'disrupted' by the Next Big Thing." RELATED: TRENDING LIFE & STYLE NEWS THIS HOUR Many elements of Taplin's case are familiar. Newspaper ad revenue has declined by roughly $40 billion between 2000 and 2014, recorded music revenue has dropped $10 billion in the same period, and over 5,000 independent book and record stores have closed in the last two decades. Facebook's covert experiments in manipulating the emotions of hundreds of thousands of users, Amazon's atrocious treatment of workers at its distribution centers and Google's cavalier disregard for copyright laws are also well-documented. Taplin, director emeritus of the University of Southern California Annenberg Innovation Lab, argues that the major tech companies are fundamentally monopolistic and parasitic — they exploit positions of market dominance to ignore legal regulations, extract inflated prices from advertisers and rely on content produced by others, often without their consent or knowledge. But his explanation of how these practices arose starts much earlier. Thomas Jefferson wanted a "restriction against monopolies" added to the Bill of Rights, alongside freedom of religion, freedom of the press and protection against standing armies. Alexander Hamilton, founder of the Bank of New York, disagreed and ultimately prevailed. Though wealthy banking interests prevented the adoption of a clause against monopolies in the Bill of Rights, the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890 allowed President Theodore Roosevelt to break up John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil Trust. Taplin quotes Roosevelt, whose words still resonate: "the prime need is to change the conditions which enable these men to accumulate power which it is not for the general welfare that they should hold or exercise." 'Move Fast and Break Things' Little, Brown and Co. "Move Fast and Break Things," by Jonathan Taplin, Little, Brown and Co., 320 pages, $29. "Move Fast and Break Things," by Jonathan Taplin, Little, Brown and Co., 320 pages, $29. (Little, Brown and Co.) Taplin explores how the influential legal theorist and rejected Supreme Court nominee Robert Bork helped shift public and regulatory opinion in the second half of the 20th century. By claiming that the only question regulators should ask is whether monopolies affect consumer welfare, Bork essentially proposed that as long as prices fall, increasing concentrations of corporate power do not matter. Even if Wal-Mart were the only store in America, this would be a problem only if consumer prices rose. Of course, this myopic thinking ignores the fact that there might be no consumers to shop at Wal-Mart if it were allowed to obliterate every other retail business in the country. Because Wal-Mart would then be the only purchaser of many goods from wholesalers, it could extract ruinous prices. This is precisely the position of Amazon vis-a-vis book publishers. Because Amazon can deny publishers access to its enormous customer base, it can force them to accept artificially deflated prices. Google and Facebook can do something similar with advertisers by threatening to deny them access to billions of users. Taplin cites the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index, a widely used measure of market concentration in antitrust law that allows regulators to determine whether markets are becoming monopolistic. A score of 2,500 is considered highly concentrated. The HHI for internet search markets is 7,402. The sort of free-market libertarianism that scorns all government regulation is particularly ironic given the origins of the internet. Taplin recounts early research funded by the U.S. Department of Defense that explicitly structured the internet in a decentralized architecture so it could survive a nuclear attack. Not only does the absurdly concentrated power of a few companies contradict this vision, the internet itself might not exist if the anti-government visions of many tech oligarchs had been a reality in the 1960s.

Jonathan Taplin’s latest book explains how Google, Facebook and Amazon are undermining democratic institutions, accelerating the rise of oligarchy in America, and destroying both cultural and economic opportunities for millions of people. (Little, Brown and Co.) Taplin makes a forceful and persuasive case that companies like Google and Facebook could employ their powerful artificial intelligence programs to prevent the infringement of existing copyright laws. They've demonstrated their capacity to stop pornography and illegal drug markets from surfacing on search results. It would not be difficult for them to enforce copyright infringements more effectively and share some of their enormous profits with the industries they are decimating. The 2016 presidential election was a dramatic demonstration of the unintended consequences of gutting the once-influential field of journalism. But Taplin believes that his case has implications far beyond the creative industries. "We need to understand that every one of us will stand in the shoes of the artist before long. Musicians and authors were at the barricades first because their industries were the first to be digitized. ... (S)oon the technologists will be coming for your job, too, just as they will continue to come for more of your personal data," he writes. This is not a prophecy but a warning — without changes to legislation, corporate behavior and consumer values, the oligarchic dreams of a few billionaires could reshape the country even more than they already have.

WSJ: Google planning to block bad ads in Chrome on desktop and mobile Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/04/19 6:31pm PDTApr 19, 2017 67 Plus 1 on G+ 132 Share on Facebook 74 Share on Twitter Total Shares273 Google News Rumors Advertising is very much a balancing act for websites these days. You want to make enough money from an ad-supported site to cover costs, but you don't want to annoy users to the point they block all your ads. Some websites don't seem to care how much they annoy you, though. Google is reportedly getting ready to take a stand against the worst ads on the web with a built in ad-blocker for Chrome. According to the Wall Street Journal, Google's ad-blocking feature could be turned on by default in the desktop and mobile versions of Chrome. It would filter out only the ads Google deems unacceptable. That would cover things like pop-ups, auto-playing video ads, and “prestitial” ads with countdown timers. Google may even build the feature such that it blocks all the ads on a site that serves one of these unacceptable ads. That would nudge website operators to get all their ads in order—after all, Chrome is a huge chunk of usage. Google has not commented on the Wall Street Journal's story, probably because it's still trying to figure out how to pitch the ad blocker (if it's real). This could be seen as an attempt to coerce website operators to only run Google's AdSense ads, which are guaranteed not to run afoul of Google's blocking policies. It's a risky direction for an advertising powerhouse like Google to go, but it might not see a better way to deal with the prevalence of ad-blocking.

AbbyZFresh What did WSJ do to you? Nathan J What did they do for you? The Wall Street Journal is owned by Rupert Murdoch's News Corp, which runs the propaganda arm of the Republican party in the US, better known as Fox News. Murdoch's interference in politics and opposition to freedom isn't limited to the US. I don't recall the details, but the EU or UK was about to kick him out for starting trouble over there a year or two ago. I'm not real big on politics, but I think a certain distrust of News Corp, to a point, is healthy and should not really be questioned. Cakefish You might be referring to News of The World - a British tabloid newspaper run by Rupert Murdoch that was closed down a few years ago because it was found to have spied on people's phones. This included hacking the phone of a murdered teenager and soldiers who had died in combat. It caused a massive uproar. ZettabyteGamer Spread a lot of false information about YouTubers, and YouTube as a platform. They focus on clicks, and getting subscribers instead of accurate information reporting. givitumibeybi WSJ is a wannabe BuzzFeed newspaper. Trooper311 Awesome. Josh Crumley Good. Those ones where you load a page and start reading then suddenly disappears and a fullscreen ad with a 5 "second" timer starts going that takes about 5 seconds *per* second...ugh (looking at you gawker media).

Just use Brave Browser for Android--it's essentially Chrome with adblocking, tracker blocking, HTTPS and fingerprinting protection with a few added necessities. Nathan J On mobile, just run a system-wide ad blocker. AdGuard on Android and AdBlock on iOS. Chrome works just fine with no ads seen anywhere. MJ Nothing wrong with Adguard but installing a whole app seems overkill when an browser add-on will do. I really have no interest in using Chrome on mobile. ZettabyteGamer What mobile browser do you use, our of curiosity? My1 well because if you do things like adaway and whatnot all the apps' ads will be kicked right into oblivion and not just the browser's ones. also when you have root, you can let the adblocker just play with the hosts file and let the networking layer do its thing. MJ I just need an ad blocker for the browser. I normally don't install programs that don't let you pay to remove ads. Root is a go since I use Android Pay. Finding it weird I have now had a half dozen replies giving me suggestions and "solutions" yet I didn't express having any problem... My1 well I dunno how secure android pay is but unless there is a chip similar to a smartcard or apple's secure enclave in the phone which stores all the needed data, it can be copied, effectively killing everything. I like my banking card with chip which is pretty much exactly a smart card meaning you cant read out any data without essentially destroying the card itself, and if made properly, the data will destroy itself when tampering happens. MJ I don't know where you live but in the US the smart chip on cards as been a disaster. This is the procedure to do a transaction... 1. Look at machine and wonder if the smart card reader is active? Is there a sign? Will the clerk tell me? No? Ask or guess... 2. The smartcard reader is active so now have to choose 1-3 options with buttons than wait 5-10 seconds for the transaction to be done. 3. Be startled by the annoying sound many terminals make like there was a error but it just means remove your card. Security? The magnetic stripe is still there! The procedure for a wireless transaction... 1. Look for the wireless/Android Pay symbol. Hold phone up to terminal and a second later transaction is done. Security? I know it uses end-to-end encryption for transactions. What will copy what and how? Carsten AdGuard is not for your browser, but for your whole system. So, "Free with ads" becomes basically free, for example ;) Nathan J Or "free with a white space taken out from where the ad was." Some ad blockers on the computer (or most now, maybe) can also remove the space, but we're not there yet on phones. Of course, you shouldn't use an ad blocker to rip off app developers. Buy the ad-free version. The only one I'm not doing that for is the weather apps. Most of them won't let you just buy an ad free version. They'll let you take the ads off for a year, but then they come back and/or they charge you again. Pretty greedy! Of course, there are pay-once weather apps, but the popular ones (Weather Channel, Weather Underground) only have the subscription. (I really need to just suck it up and get Dark Sky...) Carsten Well, we are - in most apps I don't get empty spaces. In Chrome definitely not, AdGuard uses some stuff (I don't know how) to remove the spaces entirely. Also: you can get lifetime licenses ;) For details, see this. They have written about such things just a few days ago: https://blog.adguard.com/en/adguard-vs-adaway-dns66/ Cakefish BBC Weather app. Free with no ads. Nathan J Android only? UK only perhaps? BBC is great but often they limit things to people who pay their fees — which is completely understandable. But when the Boston Marathon bombing happened, I went straight to the Beeb for coverage, online, in the US, and it was pretty great. Live video coverage, live tweets from their people (I guess), and a summary of what went down. They're the best. Cakefish Android and iOS. I checked on the website and apparently it's only available to download in the UK. That's a shame as it's a great app but understandable. Nathan J That's a pretty arbitrary limitation, and why I got a 128GB phone. Probably more than I need, but I've used more than a 64GB phone will hold. I don't know about Adguard on Android, but AdBlock on iPhone uses 16.9MB of space. That's with its filters. The app and its data and cache. And apps are usually bigger on iOS because, unlike Android, they can't share libraries, they're totally sandboxed. My biggest space hog is Spotify at 35.4GB. But again, why I got a 128GB phone. Second biggest is a game taking up about a tenth of that. Followed by VLC, which contains all videos stored on this phone (I don't use iTunes). Get a bigger phone, man. You'll thank yourself for it many times. Or go on arbitrarily limiting yourself. But don't think it's anything but that. MJ What? I don't need a bigger phone? I mentioned nothing about storage? Limiting myself? What are talking about? LOL How about you stop trolling? Nathan J This word, trolling. It doesn't mean what you think it means. If anything, you were trolling and I tried to respond rationally. Grow up. MJ You wrote a 100 some word essay about how I needed a "bigger" phone that was not relevant to anything. BLOCKED Nathan J Run on home to your safe space, bully. Ladies and gentlemen, this is why you stand up to bullies. They usually fold. Occasionally, in epic fashion. Especially online when they find out they don't have quite the presence they do on the playground. Jorge I guess no ad blocker will work on Android if you still use Chrome. Chrome serves the content right to you instead of your phone fetching the content from the source website. You need to use a different browser to block ads. Nathan J You guess incorrectly. What you're experiencing is Google proxying around your ad blocker. You have Chrome's data saver turned on. Bypassing your ad blocker is an unintended side effect. Turn off the data saver feature and the ad blocker will in fact block ads in Chrome. Chrome is not magically evading your ad blocker. You're just using Google's proxy instead of the one your ad blocker establishes. And that's really all there is to it. However, the Google App on iOS (Google Search + Now) will always proxy around an ad blocker. I don't know if it's a data saver that just can't be disabled (which would explain it) or malice on Google's part. I'm leaning toward the latter. But the fact remains, if I Google gaming stuff and go to a Wikia site, I get slammed with ads. If I Bing it, the ads don't show up. And Bing makes a great app. Shame fandroids slam it Because It's Not Google. Real shame. They're missing out. Jorge Adguard tells you what browsers work with adblockers on install. They only accept Yandex and Samsung Internet. There's no option to make it work with Chrome and I'm forced to install one of those if I want to continue with the installation. Anyways, I'll give it a try disabling data saver but it hasn't worked in the past with other ad blockers. Carsten AdGuard DOES work with Chrome, but not the browser-plugin adguard, you have to use the full app adguard. It even works with data saver, what confuses me, but it does. Necdet Ali Özdür Try Samsung Browser on mobile, it supports ad blocking. MJ I already have an ad blocker and no interest in the Samsung browser. LOL Hrishikesh Bisen Why? bekifft I've been impressed with Brave, it's basically uBlock plus https everywhere. Or Adguard if you must use Chrome. It's worth it. I wouldn't mind ads if they didn't try to hijack my phone and install malware. senor_heisenberg Noice, about time. Tom Erlandsen Google working on an ad-blocker? Now there's something I never expected to read haha JD Gotta finish off the competition somehow. They weren't going to do it by releasing polished products Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ LOL, unfortunately, true. My1 google releases polish products? do they also have a subcompany on Poland? SCNR. demarcmj He said "They weren't going to do it by releasing polished products" Bombaglad have you ever heard of editing comments? Jorge Yes, only Adsense will pass the "fair ad policy" and will be correctly displayed. All the other "your phone is full of viruses" won't be displayed. I will miss the sexy vibrations in my hand. :-( JG Does ChromeOS fall into the desktop category? or is this going to be browser only? kenspiracy ChromeOS would fall into the desktop category, yes. 4Ui812 Adgaurd for the win and the block. Untung Dwi Prasetyo Yes D.Smithee They make a great content blocker for Samsung browser--and let's face it, their Adguard VPN blocker for unrooted Android is a godsend. Cakefish I have a choice to use either the preinstalled Chrome browser or the preinstalled Samsung Internet browser on my phone. Samsung Internet supports adguard content blocker. Chrome does not. The choice is clear. In fact, it's hard to call it a choice. There is only one viable option to take. D.Smithee Did you not see my mention of the Adguard VPN that blocks ads in all browsers? So, yeah--you can use Chrome. Carsten I never thought I would pay for an ad blocker, but AdGuard ist sooooooo ♥ ♥ ♥ ! Also, right into the face of haters: "There is no get-everything-free-world today!" - "Dude, I'm actaully PAYING for not seeing ads!" :D Madis Surely you're paying, but who the money goes to is what matters... Carsten Yep, it is. You see, the argument against adblockers is: "There must be ads, otherwise everything would cost money and don't tell me you would pay for stuff online! Aha! So don't be an a-hole and disable your adblocker." But: I am paying! That's the point: Not just being a guy who wants everything for free, but saying "yes, I am okay with paying for good content." Problem is, websites with ads are no good content, while an adblocker is. Johny M This is not good. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/a6fddce77432d41dfcd3c6f79fcc7fa1244c36a5ce08a0227a141e8521e57f3e.gif So the biggest online add company will punish websites that post "bad" commercials. What can go wrong with that? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Exactly. Google ad services monopoly, here we come. Necdet Ali Özdür It's been done before. I mean blocking "bad" commercials. Almost all browsers now have an option to block pop up pages. I consider this an extension of it. rockstarr27 Google will use it to block non google approved ads, furthering their monopoly. Predictable. 4Ui812 Bingo MaroonMushroom All of the bigger advertising companies would probably meet Google's standards without issue. I'm sure the bar will be set low enough to mostly target the full screen ads that say your Android phone has 6 memory viruses while it's vibrating at you. rockstarr27 "Google will only block the bad ads, they wouldn't ever try to make their ad blocking more dominant compared to competitors with this move." - Ah to be young and naive. saf1927 Ah yes, because they want another antitrust case on them. As if Android weren't enough of a headache. Yep, really nice to be naive. LAMMJR O plz god yes, block those stupid ads that block chrome in android, spamming pop ups and using vibration saying my phone will be destroyed in x seconds if I don't install whaterver app they tell me to. Carson Saldanha Omg fr. I can't believe this is still a thing. Max I only can wish suffering to whoever developed those nasty ads. Nicoleckeys Google is paying 97$ per hour!

Mr.Bean ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I would think they put those ads for curious eyes. LOL Stop playing with yourself and these ads will disappear! Defenestratus Sadly it's not just porn sites that have those these days. LAMMJR This is not exclusive to porn sites, porn sites are probably worse. Any site that offers ad-suported download can end up having one of those annoying ads. For example, sites that uses ad.fly as url shortening can end up stuffing this type of ads on your face. Modest Mind I'm not sure Google will integrate an adblocker to Chrome because Google and Ads are synonymous. Unless Google integrates an add-blocker that has a "white list" and Google Ads are at the top of that list. demarcmj They're just blocking "bad" ads Randroid Read the article. It's going to be the opposite. It's going to be a blacklist of ads that are dangerous, annoying, or intrusive Modest Mind Annoying, intrusive? That is the definition of Google ad business... justmy2pennies2012 The ones the block what you are reading and stays oin the screen as you scroll down are the worst. alexb88 Use Adguard! YaKillaCJ Oh that sounds horrible. I didn't kno ads got that bad. Been using AdAway for years now. Latheryin Ads will never be accepted by everyone. A lot of people see no use for them at all and will continue to block all ads. If they wanted commercials they can watch cable. Max Be careful with what you wish, the day ads die is the day everything will be paid on internet. TechGuy22 Like pirate don't exist lol tookieboy stupid people do though. happy pirating your gmail account Latheryin Yeah that will never happen. Even if it cuts people's use of the Internet by 65% that would not be a bad thing. And like TechGuy22 said. It will be broken. DragoCubed I can see a future with less outright box ads and ads that are hard to even tell that they are ads. Sponsored content and stuff. TechGuy22 Block these ads or the hijacked one on here specially https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/1abd2d9979769332aaaefa91b671e6683737b8fb001f1b9b41820b6a94d1eee9.png Josh Crumley But look at this one weird trick I learned! https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/c8c0b953c6e85700fbc7f7073a9f5ec68cb6a87dbf0c0afbca12b88428163ea5.png ilovetesla seriously , try it , its very good and a healthy tip for the phone internet never lies Jorge That only works on iOS.

Totally worth it ilovetesla #FANTAPOWER Chris ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) How fantastic. Bruce Wayne Those ads are annoying. They are usually served up by a company called Outbrain. Jorge They're not that annoying. No other ads make your phone vibrate that sexy. Bruce Wayne Jorge, I'm going to need you to take your phone out of your pants. Jorge Why? I like the vibes inside my pants. They put me in the mood. Cakefish And Taboola and Revcontent jonzey231 "You'll never guess what she looks like now!!" Brian Kittelson I have add blocked these. Some of these are borderline NSFW. I don't need T&A ads while browsing a tech news website at work thank you. DragoCubed Awesome sauce LOL So no more pussiеs and тiтs on the side bar? Damn.... Michael Hazell Never thought I'd see the day that Google would assume the role as an ad blocker, but honestly I appreciate them filtering those ads on mobile devices where it's like "your device has 6 million viruses, install to fix." Those are just cancer and needed to be blocked anyways. I've been such a heavy ad blocker that I forgot what it's like to deal with cancerous ads on the internet. xmascarroll For some reason, my stock V20 always gets "Android Alert! Your device, GENERIC ANDROID DEVICE, has xxx viruses! Run Android GENERIC ANDROID DEVICE Cleaner now!" D.Smithee We'll assume you didn't run said cleaner. ilovetesla then, follow the instructions, its a generic cleaner Jorge What are you waiting for? Go do that right now. Your phone and your bank account will appreciate that. YuCMi Yes please! If this works the way it is described here, I'll turn off my indiscriminate adblocker. Dmitry Stepanushkin ADBlock. Problem solved 😂 Lord Argyris Somehow I'm categorizing this one in the "I'll believe it when I see it" category. It sounds an awful lot like an Outbrain story, which, incidentally enough, is one of the reasons people run ad blockers. That all said, these are the kinds of things I want to see blocked: -Anything that autoplays, makes noise, etc. -Anything that blinks, pops up, obscures the screen, or otherwise tries to distract me -Clickbait repos -Any and all forms of tracking--leave ad content selection up to the host site, or just push random ads The first two might be reasonably expected from a hypothetical Google ad blocker, but the third is questionable (the stories don't usually run afoul of the other criteria on the list; they're just trashy and take up page space and bandwidth). For the last one, however, I can barely hear myself typing over the laughter of the big ad companies (Google included). Tracking makes ads much more effective, and I don't see anything (apart from federal regulation, which has its own problems, not to mention scope limitations) that will ever manage to shove that genie back into the bottle. I'll play along with the rumor for a moment. What Google is likely doing here is protecting not just its ad revenue, but its ability to build up tracking data, which is immensely valuable. Trackers can be blocked by sufficiently motivated individuals, and third party extensions make this a lot easier. This is where Google wants to move in. By offering a basic solution to casual ad blockers, who just don't want to deal with the annoyance and page slowdown of heavily ad-infested sites, Google is ensuring that those tracking cookies are still set and that it (Google) and other third party ad companies can keep harvesting that data, even if people aren't seeing as many annoying ads. As an end user, this benefits me in some ways and hurts me in others. On the one hand, I feel like the presence of a Chrome-native, on-by-default blocker will bring about at least some progress on eradicating the Internet of the worst ad offenders, particularly if the penalty for non-compliance is that your site gets no revenue whatsoever from Chrome users who stick with the defaults. On the other hand, this will put the squeeze on more capable third party extensions that offer more granular control (as well as the ability to block more than just the ads themselves), which might drive some of them out of the market. Also, it abstracts the issue of tracking away from ad blocking--everybody can see the ads (and be creeped out at how relevant they are), but fewer people know about the tracking behind the scenes. If Google just makes some of the most annoying ads go away, many people will be satisfied, even if the tracking is still taking place. It also seems dangerously close to the sort of anticompetitive behavior commonly associated with late 90s-era Microsoft, since it's clear Google isn't being altruistic here. It's going to benefit from this initiative, and disproportionately to the other players in the market (both ad blockers and other ad companies). Notice what's not ever going to be blocked: Google-sourced ads. Everything else is theoretically fair game. Companies looking to advertise, as well as sites looking for ad revenue, will both be more confident in going with the Google ad platform than with competitors because they know that their ads will be compliant and that they won't risk losing revenue due to Google's ad blocker. We'll see how this shakes out. If a Chrome ad blocker is indeed under consideration, I suspect this information was purposely leaked to see what sort of reaction it gets. ast00 Block ads? Yes, please. Only accept AdSense? Oh hell no! (please link the gif) bozzykid The report says it will use the same "Acceptable Ads" that Adblock Plus supports so it wouldn't be accepting just Adsense. tookieboy don't bother.. people don't read ast00 I know what it says, but Google is no stranger to uncompetitive tactics. bozzykid I'm not sure you can read. The report makes it clear. Cory Wilson I want to be rid of the stupid ads that take over the whole screen and say "congratulations we're giving away giftcards to users who live in , you have 5 minutes to redeem". you can't get out of them unless you close the window and reopen. Anonymous and what about adsense? My1 well I think google isnt stupid enough to make adsense that bad so it would fall under the blocking guidelines, I mean adsense ads I saw were iirc usually just banners on the top, bottom or side. cr08 Yeah. Adsense has always been really lean and unobstrusive with their ads. I'd be happy with allowing adsense ads and also ads from other networks that are also unobtrusive. Hopefully with Google's knack for self learning algorithims they can nail this down. D.Smithee It's good news--but a little too late, Google. I've been using a content blocker since the very early 2000's with Firefox. Now I use uBlock Origin with Chrome desktop. I came to the conclusion a LONG time ago that sites don't have our best interests at heart. Even the ones that proclaim they do. For me, ads/trackers/etc. became a security issue quite some time ago--I just can't trust sites, so I just block ALL ads/trackers/undesirable content. And if a site objects to it or blocks users using content blockers, I just get my information elsewhere. It's that simple. Branko So awesome. Will it eventually filter "hate speech" and "fake news" too Google? If you want to place in a mechanism for ad blocking, users must have control over it. Otherwise it's prone to abuse of self interests. Go fuck yourselves Google. Disphouf Thats funny, I changed Chrome with Brave browser because their adblocker givitumibeybi lol. I can't understand why everyone is so excited. This will just be an Embrace, Extend, and Extinguish move. Kwetsima Maluleke Wow Google. Not bad. Its not like Samsung and Apple haven't had ad blockers for years now. givitumibeybi What's the difference between morals of using torrents to install overpriced things for free, and using adblockers to get access to the content of a website with disturbing advertisements for free? Cakefish - Taboola - Outbrain - Revcontent ^ THIS SCOURGE OF THE INTERNET MUST BE DESTROYED!!! I will not retire the use of my adblocker until those companies are wiped off the face of the planet. Truly, they are evil incarnate. They must die in a pit of flaming fury. Morten Ulv I wonder what happens on pages that block people from reading if they have an ad blocker. My mother would surely not know what to do. Markus Birth The fun thing is: Once EVERY Chrome user gets blocked from viewing those pages, they will very soon die or turn off their adblock-blocker. Better for everyone. Zach Mauch Hopefully it will also fight against adds using excessive processing. That is the major reason I still run it on sites as prominent as Android Central. They can just destroy performance. jonzey231 I could see this turning an anti-competition suit very quickly. It wouldn't be intentional but it would end up being Google blocking their own competitor's ads while allowing their own to flourish. It'll be seen the same as Android using only Google as the default search provider...and that definitely hasn't gone well for them abroad. Mark Curtis ALL ads are bad, I'm entitled to free content, gimme gimme gimme Chris Sanner I'll be honest - if they do this, I'd probably disable my other ad blocker entirely. I don't mind ALL ads, it's the ones that are COMPLETELY obnoxious that cause me to block the rest. currently most hated? the ones that show up as you scroll through a story and you have to scroll through them to get back to scrolling the site. John Petersen No way. This is just asking for abuse and conflicts of interest. Just enable add-ons for mobile, and let unvested third parties take care of the ad-blocking. PVL_93_RU I'm waiting to see how advertisement companies find a way around this built-in blocking LOL I am using adblocker via router so all devices connected are blocked BC This would be a lovely thing because I only disdain the annoying adverts that pop up and block my screen...Banners aren't bad as I can see those without having content obscured, also Google needs to get better at blocking the ads that cause redirects. Those really piss me off. PIucky Duck 🇩🇪 Rooted phone with AdAway is the way to go F4LL0U7 FYI, Adguard for Android is awesome. No root required. They have a desktop Chrome extension too, if you like having your ad blockers match across all devices. Michael Payton Endgame will be to block all ads not sold thru Google. That's how they make most of they're money, and other people will have to advertise thru them to get their ads seen. Vivek Rameses Don't be fooled, all ads are bad. YaKillaCJ Or here's a better idea, allow extensions in mobile. Maybe keep it in the beta to keep away the average person or at least express its a little advance. Brandon Good! Google is the ONLY ad network I trust to not contain malware. Until these websites properly audit their ad content and ensure it's not laden with malware then I will continue running an ad-blocker and a DNS blackhole. Anyone with a Pi checkout PiHole. bekifft If only Google offered some sort of service that would let you pay them money to block the ads...you'd still contribute to the sites, but only the ones that serve Google ads. They could call it something like... Google Contributor maybe? Just a crazy idea... I know I'd use it...

Some Pixel phones are having problems with backups, Google is looking into it Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/04/20 10:35am PDTApr 20, 2017 22 Plus 1 on G+ 14 Share on Facebook 42 Share on Twitter Total Shares78 Bug Watch Google News Pixel Pixel XL Some users have been experiencing issues with backup on Google's Pixel devices, most notably backups of SMS, call history, and apps, although other accounts of all backup types failing have also been reported.  The current cause isn't known, but reports of the problem on Google's product forums stretch back to just after the launch of the device, and for many the matter remains unresolved. Even one of Google's support specialists discovered he was experiencing the issue, but apart from reaching out to those affected for bug reports no information has been publicly provided. To be clear, for those with the problem their personal data in one or more categories may not be being backed up as they would expect. Not to be alarmist, but with this backup error occurring silently, it might be prudent for Pixel users to check that their devices are, in fact, performing their backups as expected and intended. To check for yourself, navigate to Settings, Backup and Reset, Backup and see if any of the items listed under Content are "Waiting to backup." If you are among those suffering the problem you might want to exercise some caution and consider another backup method for whatever might be failing for you. Also, feel free to add your voices (and log-files) down at Google's product forums. They're currently reaching out to those affected there for additional information, and with more data the issue can probably be fixed that much more quickly.

Gustavo Me too, also only seeing it in Call History on my Pixel teh Jax At least the important ones are working fine! Andrew same here Ryne Hager That's not a huge deal, then. Not the worst thing to lose if your phone eats it. Photos or SMS could be a bigger problem, though. teh Jax Right. If somebody is experiencing this bug with other pieces of data, this is a big deal! If this is all it is, hardly anybody is going to care. And those that do care probably should be using multiple forms of backup anyway. Sachin Bahal Same here Suicide_Note Same. That's the only one that had any issue on my device. steb0ne Same here... So most people in this comment section who actually have Pixel devices seem to be having the same issue with the call history not backing up and a bunch of trolling by other people talking about how it's plagued with bugs, lol! Got it! I wonder how long it's been acting up... Everything else shows backed up this morning. If this is a daily backup and it didn't backup one day is this really that big of a deal? The screenshot posted shows December... I'm curious to know is this a Google feature or Pixel feature? Can someone else with a phone running Nougat confirm if theirs is backing up? teh Jax Definitely a lot of trolling and ignorance going on in these comments. That's pretty typical by people commenting about a premium device that they either can't buy or chose not to buy - it helps them justify their situation. Which is fine by me. It's rare that comments are actually insightful. ¯_(ツ)_/¯ teddyfrozevelt Mine hasn't backed up since I factory reset it in december. Everything else has backed up. Impulse_Vigil It's an Android feature, has been forever, but O and the Pixel are the first places where it's status has been exposed and broken down by category. So it may or may not be working elsewhere, you wouldn't really know. Now freak out! Heh... steb0ne That's what I thought... So it's possibly happening on other non Pixel devices. The article made it seem Pixel specific CJ Me too. Maxr1998 Same for me, Nexus 6P, O Preview. Also had that issue for SMS & apps after I clean-flashed the update, but I could at least fix the latter by manually running "bmgr backupnow --all" in a su shell. SMS somehow resolved itself it seems. Impulse_Vigil Same, everything else is backed up, didn't even know call history could be backed up. 4Ui812 Better call Saul. Bat Man 1 day = 1 problem? 4Ui812 Nausea, heartburn, indigestion, upset stomach, diarrhea.... Google's quality control is hard at work. Middlefinger Yeah, but at least it gets 'Timely updates' /s Phalkon30 Just bought my 6p 2 weeks ago, not a single thing moved to it from my previous device. It's like I never had a Google history, even though I have app backups on my Google Drive. I even tried to to set up from another device, it gave an unknown error and moved nothing I'm going to have to root to fix it, awful backup solution sproc I think it only works with the same phone honestly, cause otherwise I bet no one uses it sadly. Tiuri Elvander Sent in my 6p for an RMA, it was fully backed up. Tried to restore the backup on my replacement 6p but it only offered my One plus One (which I used while I was waiting for my replacement). The whole thing lasted less than a week, yet my original backup was not available as an option to restore. Very annoying!! Jordan VanCampen Same here. My work phone which is a Moto z play stopped working. I got a replacement and thought that I'd be able restore it from the previous one, but nope. The setup process only gave me the option to restore from my Vizio tablet that came with my TV that I recently bought. My pixel that is my personal phone wasn't an option. So I decided that I would use the NFC option. So I I did that with my pixel and it didn't restore anything at all. The backup situation on Android is still pretty much a dumpster fire. Ryne Hager I've had the restore from previous device thing bug out as well, I usually just set everything up as a new device now. blindexecutioner $800 device running never-ending beta software. Jingwei Zhang It does backup a lot of settings for many apps. As for games, if the game requires logging in, it backs up the log in information if you had it set as memorized. It also memorizes the layout of the apps. The backup is definitely not the best, but it's automatic and much more comprehensive than the native backup other manufacturers provide, including ios. Roy Hm, no. I used an iphone and ipod touch ages ago and they actually have a backup solution that works. When you restore, it's like you never left - even between devices. Even Blackberry had a better backup system than Android ever has - the only decent backup solution Android has is Titanium backup (which is, to be fair, excellent), and that requires root so most people are SOL. I've never even had my wifi settings restored properly, even though that's supposedly backed up. Jingwei Zhang Hm, no. We have six iPhones in the family and none of them backup like you said here (like you never left). However, my Nexus to Pixel transfer was like that. All apps, photos, sms and etc were restored to the same position and most pertinent settings were restored. IIRC, the phone even restored my company's WIFI setting with the correct credential. I don't know which android phone you have, but Google's backup does some pretty amazing things for requiring absolutely no maintenance on the user's side. EDIT: I just remembered. My sister and mom actually use Google Photo on their iPhone 6S/7 because it's free and easy as opposed to the tiny iCloud storage. JohnyNoLegs Its free when it compresses your photos. Also iPhone does whole phone backup, android does not. Also if you lose your pixel right now, you are screwed, as you can't do a transfer. Jingwei Zhang IIRC Pixel has full photo backup without any compression. I believe I specifically said that it does some amazing things with absolutely no user side maintenance. You can always do a manual full backup with titanium or in recovery. Root and unlocked bootloader are needed, but that's just takes a few minutes with Nexus and Pixel. How is that? Everything is automatically backed up including video, pic and sms, call history and etc on a daily basis. I would wager that you can retrieve more current information from a lost Pixel/Nexus than from a lost iPhone if they were both lost and went completely off the grid. JohnyNoLegs Wager away, then send me the money. iPhone does a bit for bit backup, it backs up the current state of the whole iPhone. Google does not do this. Google selectively backs up items like call history, sms etc. Pixel is the only Android phone that offers uncompressed backup for free, not really an option for everyone mate. Titanium backup is for ROOT LOLOLOLOL. Recovery is for unlocked devices LOLOLOLOLOL iPhone does complete backup with any hacking required, talk about no user side maintenance! BTW, my Pixel stopped backup up photos, it's a bug. Doesn't sound like no user maintenance required haha Jingwei Zhang hmm comparing full backup that can take upwards of an hour to one that runs in the background huh? You definitely understand what no user maintenance is and are certainly brilliant. Comparing apple to orange as long as it suits your narrative. Are we talking about any other android phone? I don't think so. Unlocking bootloader and granting root access are considered hacking now? Bugs and failures happen, just like how two of our iPhone 6 bricked just out of warranty. Also, my Pixel is not experiencing this bug, so it's not a problem for me (yet). JohnyNoLegs Think logically for a second mate. You are talking a out no user maintenance. IPhone does full backups while you sleep. Android does not. To root your phone and unlock the bootloader requires user maintenance. Impulse_Vigil I do think iOS backup functionality is more comprehensive, it doesn't leave things up to individual devs either... OTOH it does gobble up a pretty decent amount of storage on accounts where people often end up having to pay extra for... Nothing is perfect. JohnyNoLegs It's true, but for the person who just wants their stuff backed up, IOS has it covered much better than android. Even the simplicity of setting up iCloud to do everything is great. In Android it is a bit all over the shop in deep settings and different apps. I'm fine with Androids implementation, but then again I don't care about doing factory resets etc which is kinda the nature of android. iPhone users perhaps are less used to having to restore their data all the time. Ryne Hager I think it backs up some appdata, like Netflix login information carrying over to new devices, that sort of thing. JohnyNoLegs After an RMA and a few factory resets, I can tell you it hasn't in my case. Impulse_Vigil It can do that, but apps need to be written for it, backup has always been a joke on Android but it's largely because devs ignore the existing tools tbh. Killa I'm not seeing any option on my Nexus 6 in the Backup & Reset area that shows the breakout of the different backup content like it does in the image above. There's just the On/Off switch and language that says backups are in Google Drive...etc. Is this only a Pixel thing or higher version of Android? Phalkon30 Must be a pixel thing, I don't see it on my 6P either, and I'm on 7.1.2 Cyan Thayn It's also an O thing apparently, have the exact menu shown in the screenshots on my 6P on the O preview (and have the same bugs as well!). Ryne Hager It's a pixel thing, no need to worry. Impulse_Vigil I'm not even sure what the point is, I guess extra info and transparency (which is good), because none of those options really do anything but tell you what's being backed up. There's nothing to toggle besides the main backup option and the option to backup to Drive. Shoot, other phones could be suffering the same issues but because the backup status isn't displayed nobody would know! On my Pixel everything but call history is up to date, and I couldn't care less about that. Ishimaru Another day, another Pixel issue. Ramon Google is fucking up a lot lately. What's taking so long to fire some people? Just not just lately Conrad Okay, so what happened to the review of the Synology 416play? I'd really like to read it! lomsha Some premium device lol. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Once again, I told you so. You should really run a daily series called "Google Screwup Of The Day". Ryne Hager Your name is amazing. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Not many people get it. ;) J.J. Pixel and problem are two words heard often lately! Leif Sikorski Same with previous Nexus and some other Google Hardware devices. It's one reason why I'm glad that other OEMs update slower these days. Google keeps giving me the impression that they still see their devices as geeky developer devices where the user does the final testing. If they want to be more serious with their hardware efforts and compete with the big brands they need to invest much more money into testing and customer support. Ryne Hager Eh, bugs happen with any tech, and the volume of problems has gotten a lot smaller than things used to be back in the day. Progress has its pitfalls, is all. Nick I'm with you here. I get that people expect nothing but excellence from a device that they paid a pretty penny for, but stuff happens sometimes and so far it hasn't been anything that warrants the level of indignation I am seeing here in the comment section. I'm sure Google will fix the issue as soon as they possibly can. JohnyNoLegs And by progress, you mean they haven't really done anything different right? Still the same updates with bugs, still take ages to fix anything. I am still having the worst bluetooth experience of any phone I have owned, and that's after an RMA already! Anon Now we know why the pixel includes 24/7 support. Lisarbeams Managing director of Google!, is explaining to users to start off "Work at home" method, that People have been doing for about one year now.

Let's see what the bug list for the S8 looks like six months down the line! Phil We're already on a pink screen and what's it been? 2 weeks? I've not heard any reports of exploding Pixels so far at least. Most of the people trolling these articles are Sammy Knights who should know better. I'm looking forward to seeing what problems the S8 has over the next 6 months. By the way, is Bixby's working yet? Mike Bastable The Pixel handsets seen to be agreeing poorly... Lot of bugs recently... Sachin Bahal no device will ever be perfect, there will always be some issue(s) during a device's life cycle, and it just so happens that the Pixel's issues/bugs are happening 6 months into the phone's life cycle Ryne Hager Yeah, I expect they'll probably get things fixed. Bugs happen. Sachin Bahal The Pixel is just crawling with bugs ;) Hussain Ahmadi And some go on to call this crap as best Android phone? A big joke and Google has made a really big joke of itself by releasing this iAndroid phone!! Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ The Pixel is STILL listed as the Best Android Phone on most sites, despite all the problems, the halos in the pictures, etc. Even though I NEVER thought it deserved that status, I can understand that most of its problems surfaced after web magazines rated it. But it's clear now that the phone sucks and its software sucks. If publishing had any integrity, they'd issue a correction, revoke that title and make some other phone the best phone of 2016. Impulse_Vigil Or most of the problems aren't really as wide spread as some seem to believe, I've had pretty much no issues with mine. Marty I had a Google backup issue on my OP3T. I factory wiped it after an update and the restore function usually seen during set up didn't appear. YaKillaCJ Something about that picture just bugs me... Impulse_Vigil I see what you did there! Have a ^ Arcest Not new adb restore failed to re-install apk https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/37130390 Sir_Brizz Compromise free device. Actually getting tired of making this joke, which says something. Impulse_Vigil Compromise and bug free since Nov here. /shrug New_Guy Geez, they Pixel has so many issues, it's crazy... Phil This problem is only being reported by people enrolled on the beta testing of Android O ffs. Of course there are going to be bugs with am OS still in the testing stage. That's the whole point isn't it? Give people an early look in order that they can identify bugs and instabilities? The problem is not the phone, it a Dev version of an OS. Kevin Sword Loving your hero images Ryne! Mr.Bean ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ We're gonna need a can of Raid to squash these bugs. Muzaffar Don't mind the bugs, as long as it get stock android and latest update. ashjas Are these options only pixel specific..? I mean I don't see such backup options on my Nexus 4 with nougut custom rom? Impulse_Vigil Call history is waiting to be backed up here weird, everything else is current. I didn't even know my phone backed up call history tbh... Seems I've gotten ultra lucky with Pixel bugs, outside a handful of sporadic instances of Bluetooth turning off thru the start of the year I've avoided just about everything else. Got mine in November FWIW, tap on wood. Bala Same here since day one for SMS and call history ,it's funny when they say they are looking into. A feature that's supposed to work with final release is not working for a while and still they are looking Jan Machovec Is this something Pixel specific? Because I don't see any option to backup SMS, Call log and others on my SGS7.

To support Ad Age and the industry we cover please either: SUBSCRIBE or WHITELIST US Publishers Voice Cautious Optimism On Google's Ad-Blocking Browser By Garett Sloane. Published on April 20, 2017. Most Popular Google may indeed be working on a browser with ad-blocking capabilities built in, as the Wall Street Journal reported today. In a series of interviews, publishers reported being cautiously optimistic about the idea. However they issued a warning: If Google oversteps, it could lead them to rethink buying its ad technology. Beyond that, they said, the move could raise antitrust concerns. The search giant is working on an ad filter that would be built into its Chrome web browser, people familiar with the plans confirmed. The browser would have an option for users to stop ads from loading on sites that Google blacklists for having poor ad experiences, such as videos that play automatically with the sound on and other annoying formats, according to multiple people familiar with the plans, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Google has discussed its ad-block browser option for months with publishers. It has also been floating other components of the strategy: Helping publishers collect payments from people who employ ad blockers when visiting their sites -- a program being called "Funding Choices," according to one person familiar with the initiative. Funding Choices is a new take on Google Contributor, which had been in the works for years as a way to get people to pay for web content. Google also is working on scoring websites for their ad experiences, and would blacklist sites that fail, meaning the site would then be prevented from showing ads, a publishing source said. "If they blacklist you because of bad creative, Chrome will block all the ads on the site," said one publishing exec, not authorized to discuss the offering. "Google becomes the judge, jury and executioner. Next thing you know, you're making zero money." Still, most publishers were cautiously optimistic, because Google would likely take care not to alienate its top ad tech customers. Many publishers use Google's DoubleClick to sell ads on their sites and use its analytics to track data on their sites. Google may be all powerful, but it is not suicidal. As such, many publishers see Google's ad-block plans as a way to clean up the web: Currently 29% of impressions are blocked in the U.S., according to Frédéric Montagnon, CEO of Secret Media, a company that works with publishers on ad blocking. "Building an ad blocker into Chrome is a way to tell the market it needs to clean up," Montagnon said. "They are communicating that this is not a sustainable way web pages can be monetized." Secret Media has seen the effect of ad blocking--the more people block, the worse ads get. Some publishers are stuffing videos with up to three pre-roll ads at a time to make up for lost impressions from ad blockers. The average page has 20% more ads on it compared to a year ago, Montagnon said. Google did not respond to requests for a comment. If successful, premium publishers and advertisers could benefit from a flight to quality websites and enforcing a whitelist of acceptable domains. Some voiced concerns that well-meaning sites might get caught in the filter as Google works out its ad-blocking tech. Related Stories Why Ad Blocking Will Save the Ad Industry: You Don't Want Consumers Who Don't Want You VIDEO: Thank Goodness for Ad Blockers? And if it were used to aggressively punish publishers, or promote Google's sites, then the ad blocking function could raise the suspicions of antitrust regulators, who already keep a close watch on the company: Google's Chrome accounts for almost 60% of the browser market, according to Net Market Share. Google's ad quality conversations have coincided with the work of the Coalition for Better Ads, of which a number of brands and publishers are a part. The coalition has extensively studied what ads consumers find acceptable online, and Google's Chrome ad filter could help drive that vision, according to Michael Smith, senior VP-revenue and platform operations at Hearst Magazines Digital Media. "It is awesome. It's a move that is going to clean up digital advertising," Smith said. "This is the best way to respond to the ad blocking phenomenon that developed over the past two years."

The added advantage of using Google Assistant to add events is that you can use it from any Android screen and add events to your Google Calendar by just dictating a single line. Do note that if you are running Android versions lower than 6.0 (Marshmallow), then you can’t use this method, as Google Assistant is not supported for older versions. So, if you are on Android 6.0 or above then you can use the Google voice commands to save an event on the Google Calendar. Users on lower Android versions can still interact with Google Assistant via Google Allo messenger app. Sponsored Links How to add events to Google Calendar via Google Assistant: Before explaining the exact steps to save events via Google Assistant, I hope you have already configured Google Assistant on your device. Well, if you haven’t yet, then open Google app and train it to listen to your voice from any screen on your phone. This will allow you to call Google Assistant at your service and you can direct it to play songs, add notes, get answers, weather info, etc and yes add events on your Google Calendar. Let’s now see how to direct Google Assistant to save our dictated events on Google Calendar for specified date, time, and title: Trigger Google Assistant: Speak “Ok Google” phrase to activate Google Assistant. This will instantly open Google Assistant and now you can speak the voice command to add the event to Google Calendar. There are numerous commands that can be used for this purpose, so, you don’t have to stick to the voice commands that I am going to tell. Feel free to explore at your end; Google Assistant will understand it if the command is in the right context.  Let’s see simpler voice commands first, speak “add an event” and Google Assistant will then ask you details of the event and then saves it to your Google Calendar. It asks “When is the event?” which you have to reply by the date of the event. Google Assistant then asks you the date and time of the event and then the title. Once you have dictated all of these event details the Google Assistant will ask whether to save it or not. If you want to save, then speak “Ok/Done/Yes, etc”, if not, then say “cancel, no, etc”. If you choose to save the event, then Google Assistant will add the event as per the details to your Google Calendar, as shown in the main screenshot. In the same way, you can also view your Google calendar events, just ask Google Assistant “show my events to see today’s event or show my tomorrow events”. It will then fetch all events and displays them, as you can see in the screenshot below. Verdict: Google Assistant is super smart, and can perform a lot of activities for you. Above I have explained how you can easily use this to add events to your calendar. Couldn’t get simpler.

Plastc joins the likes of Coin, declaring bankruptcy Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/04/20 2:39pm PDTApr 20, 2017 14 Plus 1 on G+ 45 Share on Facebook 41 Share on Twitter Total Shares100 News Some of you might remember Plastc. They were a company that jumped on the re-programmable credit card train Coin and Google Wallet started in '13 and '12, respectively. They may have been a bit later to the game in 2014 after even Google had decided that it wasn't a good idea anymore, but they made the attempt. Later even the funding-successful Coin had to close shop due to delays, problems, and a general failure to properly keep up with the market. Unlike Coin, though, Plastc never managed to actually deliver on a product. And now just like its forebears, Plastc has decided it's time to die. This news isn't entirely surprising. Plastc's preorder update messages started verging on the Saygus-esqe: making promises of more features and upgrades, and fewer mentions of actual dates. The Plastc subreddit even decided seven months ago that the business had become a scam and was recommending people to steer clear. The company nonetheless raised in excess of $ 9 million in preorders, which is quite a lot to cut and run with. Plastc, unlike Coin, never actually managed to make or deliver a product to anyone who purchased it. Hopefully at least some of the money is left to return to backers. If not, given the quantity of cash there's always the chance of a decent lawsuit against whatever or whoever is left standing after the bankruptcy settles. The full details of their message to those who preordered are too long to quote here, but their bankruptcy statement is included below.Feel free to check out the full details at the source link. We Regret to Inform You... For the past 3 years, our mission here at Plastc was to build and deliver the most technically ambitious smart card on the planet. After making enormous leaps in development, product innovation and progress towards our goal, Plastc has exhausted all of its options to raise the money it needs to continue. Plastc, Inc. is exploring options to file Chapter 7 Bankruptcy and will cease operations on April 20, 2017. While we have fallen short of our goal, we are proud of our team and the effort that went into developing a working Plastc Card. However, without the necessary capital to continue, all employees have been let go, which means that Customer Care and Social Media channels are unmanned or have been shut down.

Is there any recourse to a refund at this point? David Ruddock Declaring bankruptcy probably doesn't bode well for refunds, no. KlausWillSeeYouNow No kidding...But what about people who submitted a refund request before they declared bankruptcy that was never answered? That's the boat I'm in. Ryne Hager Bankruptcy might interfere with that. Thankfully there's always the potential recourse of personal liability on the part of whoever owned the joint. That's gonna depend on something like a class action, though. Christina B. Try your bank and claim fraud. If that don't work a class action lawsuit has been started. Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ You can always try to get your bank or credit card issuer to do a chargeback. Technically they aren't supposed to do it beyond a certain point, but under certain circumstances they may do it for you, even after a couple of years. infiniteh I'm so glad that I got my refund when I did. Aaron Huffman I 'pre ordered' and I've been very excited for it for so long however there is a big thing I have on this. All these news entries are saying raised $9M from backers or pre orders and all that however near the end of the pre order email I have it shows plain as day just as my bank statements: "Your card will be charged at time of shipping." tldr; I was not charged a dime because they weren't shipping. Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ There seems to be differing stories on this. Some email screenshots in /r/plastc don't show that line in the email and the posters have claimed they were in fact charged. If you didn't get charge, count yourself lucky you won't have to deal with the headache of losing $150 and trying to get it back. Aaron Huffman That's all between Stripe payment and Plastc because things just have been working the way they should for me also the Plastc charge has been a gut feeling in me for about 3 years to always keep that $150 in my bank account so I can get my shipment on time when they are ready because I'm not the best at my finances yet. I've been watching my emails and bank like a hawk waiting for either a charge, an update or a decline on my card from Plastc. sbeaulieu Was sure this was a second post about Saygus Ryne Hager Thank David for the picture idea. crutchcorn Why is Mr. Davenport standing on the tombstone?

Mastercard The Government Is Clueless About eBay And Online Retail The Easiest Ways To Run Multiple Accounts From One Phone David Nield Apr 21, 2017, 10:00am ⋅ Filed to:  android apps fieldguide ios Share If you use Gmail and your office uses Google Apps or you like to maintain multiple Facebook accounts, than operating on a phone can be a nightmare. Multiple logins means constant logging out of apps and then logging back in — a process that only gets more excruciating when you have two-factor authentication (and you should really have two-factor authentication). Image: Screenshot But there's a way to have a multiple accounts without juggling multiple phones or trying to juggle multiple logins on one phone. Here are a few tips to help make your life easier. Managing multiple accounts inside apps Image: Screenshot Some apps do a decent job of handling multiple accounts all by themselves. Gmail is one example of this: the apps for iOS and Android can handle different Google email addresses very well. In fact the apps do a much better than the web interface does. You can even add other accounts, from the likes of Yahoo and Outlook, and combine all your inboxes together via the Manage accounts link on the app menu. Twitter lets you manage multiple accounts from inside the official apps for iOS and Android too. On iOS, open the Me tap, tap the Accounts icon (two portraits), then choose More options and Create new account. On Android, tap your avatar then tap the downward arrow at the top of the menu and pick Add existing account. You can't merge account streams, but you can quickly switch between them. Image: Screenshot Another app we can add to the natively-handles-multiple-accounts list is Instagram for iOS and Android. Head to your profile page, tap the menu button (three dots on Android, a cog icon on iOS), then choose Add Account. Up to five different accounts can be added (switch between them by tapping the username on the profile page), and you get push notifications for all the accounts where alerts are switched on. Meanwhile multiple account support has also made it to Facebook Messenger for iOS and Android. If you tap your profile image at the top then choose Switch Account, you can log in using different credentials, allowing you to keep up with your conversations across several different accounts. Image: Screenshot Other apps aren't so generous: Snapchat, WhatsApp, Signal and the primary Facebook app don't natively allow you to manage multiple accounts without repeatedly logging in and out (although you could log into a different Facebook account in your mobile web browser). The good news is there are a handful of apps that can help, though the major ones only work on Android for now, with Apple's OS being more restrictive in what it lets apps do. There are a few solutions for iOS that require installing unverified software from unknown sources so we're not particularly comfortable with recommending them. If you're prepared to proceed at your own risk, a quick web search will pull up some options for running multiple instances of WhatsApp or Snapchat on an iPhone. Managing multiple accounts with a third-party app Image: Screenshot First we'll look at the one app that work on Apple devices reliably: Friendly. It's available for both iOS and Android. It works as a kind of wrapper for the Facebook mobile website, and promises to reduce storage and data usage compared with the official app, as well as adding some extra bonuses — such as multiple account support. Install and log into Friendly and you can log into your Facebook (and Instagram) accounts one by one, then switch between them with a tap. It's not the fastest or most stylish app we've ever seen, and you need to pay a couple of dollars to remove the ads, but if you're on iOS it's the best choice currently available. Image: Screenshot Android users will have a much easier time supporting multiple instances of an app. App Cloner does an incredibly thorough job. As the name suggests, it creates a clone of your original app that you can set up with an alternative set of user credentials, so you have two instances of the same app running side-by-side. App Cloner lets you tweak the name and icon style of the second instance of your apps, and even hide the shortcut from the app drawer if you want. It works with the likes of Facebook, Skype and Spotify, though you might find bugs with some apps, and it struggles with apps requiring Google accounts. If you upgrade to the premium version of the app, you can gain access to more customisation options for your cloned apps, and clone WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger. Image: Screenshot Equally impressive in its capabilities is Parallel Space, which does just about the same job as App Cloner. In fact its list of supported apps is longer than App Cloner's, and includes WhatsApp free of charge. All your duplicate apps are handled through the Parallel Space interface, which makes them a bit more awkward to use. Some users have reported issues with crashes and excessive battery drain on Parallel Space, but we didn't notice any major problems with the app during our testing, though, of course, with anything like this it's liable to break at any time as developers update their code and sign-in processes change. Bear in mind too that apps like WhatsApp are tied to your mobile number, so you'll need a second number to set up a separate instance of the app. The app does feature plenty of ads too, but you can remove those with an in-app purchase.

Plastc joins the likes of Coin, declaring bankruptcy Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/04/20 2:39pm PDTApr 20, 2017 14 Plus 1 on G+ 45 Share on Facebook 41 Share on Twitter Total Shares100 News Some of you might remember Plastc. They were a company that jumped on the re-programmable credit card train Coin and Google Wallet started in '13 and '12, respectively. They may have been a bit later to the game in 2014 after even Google had decided that it wasn't a good idea anymore, but they made the attempt. Later even the funding-successful Coin had to close shop due to delays, problems, and a general failure to properly keep up with the market. Unlike Coin, though, Plastc never managed to actually deliver on a product. And now just like its forebears, Plastc has decided it's time to die. This news isn't entirely surprising. Plastc's preorder update messages started verging on the Saygus-esqe: making promises of more features and upgrades, and fewer mentions of actual dates. The Plastc subreddit even decided seven months ago that the business had become a scam and was recommending people to steer clear. The company nonetheless raised in excess of $ 9 million in preorders, which is quite a lot to cut and run with. Plastc, unlike Coin, never actually managed to make or deliver a product to anyone who purchased it. Hopefully at least some of the money is left to return to backers. If not, given the quantity of cash there's always the chance of a decent lawsuit against whatever or whoever is left standing after the bankruptcy settles. The full details of their message to those who preordered are too long to quote here, but their bankruptcy statement is included below.Feel free to check out the full details at the source link. We Regret to Inform You... For the past 3 years, our mission here at Plastc was to build and deliver the most technically ambitious smart card on the planet. After making enormous leaps in development, product innovation and progress towards our goal, Plastc has exhausted all of its options to raise the money it needs to continue. Plastc, Inc. is exploring options to file Chapter 7 Bankruptcy and will cease operations on April 20, 2017. While we have fallen short of our goal, we are proud of our team and the effort that went into developing a working Plastc Card. However, without the necessary capital to continue, all employees have been let go, which means that Customer Care and Social Media channels are unmanned or have been shut down.

Is there any recourse to a refund at this point? David Ruddock Declaring bankruptcy probably doesn't bode well for refunds, no. KlausWillSeeYouNow No kidding...But what about people who submitted a refund request before they declared bankruptcy that was never answered? That's the boat I'm in. Ryne Hager Bankruptcy might interfere with that. Thankfully there's always the potential recourse of personal liability on the part of whoever owned the joint. That's gonna depend on something like a class action, though. Christina B. Try your bank and claim fraud. If that don't work a class action lawsuit has been started. Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ You can always try to get your bank or credit card issuer to do a chargeback. Technically they aren't supposed to do it beyond a certain point, but under certain circumstances they may do it for you, even after a couple of years. infiniteh I'm so glad that I got my refund when I did. Aaron Huffman I 'pre ordered' and I've been very excited for it for so long however there is a big thing I have on this. All these news entries are saying raised $9M from backers or pre orders and all that however near the end of the pre order email I have it shows plain as day just as my bank statements: "Your card will be charged at time of shipping." tldr; I was not charged a dime because they weren't shipping. Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ There seems to be differing stories on this. Some email screenshots in /r/plastc don't show that line in the email and the posters have claimed they were in fact charged. If you didn't get charge, count yourself lucky you won't have to deal with the headache of losing $150 and trying to get it back. Aaron Huffman That's all between Stripe payment and Plastc because things just have been working the way they should for me also the Plastc charge has been a gut feeling in me for about 3 years to always keep that $150 in my bank account so I can get my shipment on time when they are ready because I'm not the best at my finances yet. I've been watching my emails and bank like a hawk waiting for either a charge, an update or a decline on my card from Plastc. sbeaulieu Was sure this was a second post about Saygus Ryne Hager Thank David for the picture idea. crutchcorn Why is Mr. Davenport standing on the tombstone?

IIRC Coin wasn't a Kickstarter project, but a pre order/website style deal. And they didn't go bankrupt, Fitbit bought them. :) (Source: http://fortune.com/2016/05/18/no-more-products-from-digital-wallet-startup-coin) Ryne Hager As someone who gave Coin money I should have known that, I could have sworn. Fixed! davidofmidnight "As someone who gave Coin coin" FIFY mcored Well Znaps didn't even openly admitted they will not deliver. Plastic at least did. Regardless, bad news for backers. abqnm Should have hired the people behind Saygus. Barry Kaufman All of these credit card replacement concepts are eventually going to die out.

Even with multi-user support, Google Home can't create reminders or calendar appointments Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/04/20 1:39pm PDTApr 20, 2017 31 Plus 1 on G+ 20 Share on Facebook 40 Share on Twitter Total Shares91 Google Google Home News Videos Google announced multi-user support for Google Home earlier today, but it's only launching in the US right now. This is finally a chance for Google to rectify things and add all those features Home was lacking at launch, and indeed Google has included a few new features. We're still missing some big ones, though. You still cannot create a reminder or add events to your calendar. After going through the setup process for multi-user, Google Home has access to some of your personal account information. That allows you to ask questions about what's on your calendar, view photos tied to your Google Photos account, and so on. However, writing data to your account appears to be a sticking point. If you try to create a reminder or a calendar appointment, Home tells you it can't do that yet, just like it did before. Hopefully the addition of multi-user support will let Google add these very basic features soon. Seriously, adding something to your calendar has to be one of the most common tasks for a human assistant. It's certainly not impossible to do this stuff, either. Assistant on the phone can create reminders and events just fine. Tags Google google assistant google home video subscribe ...

I'll make millions (of reminders)! Good_Ole_Pinocchio Google can't even handle the basics of their own services here.....SAD! lzdking Make Google Great Again! #MGGA mark555055d Such a disappointment. Google better start ramping up the functions on this thing or it will fail. Also, if they do something stupid like releasing a Google home 2 anytime soon, the shit will fly. LondonLeedsFan I thought about Google Home 2 about 3 days after buying this one and realising it doesn't do so much... I can't help but think it's going to happen. mark555055d Yeah... i could totally see them doing something stupid like making a GH2, with bluetooth pairing capability, improving the mics and speaker, charging $30 more for it, and then giving it an "exclusive" software version that allows reminders and calendar support, all while leaving the GH1 back for months due to "hardware differences". LondonLeedsFan IMO something like this should not be on a 1 or 2 year upgrade cycle. If that's how it goes, I'll leave it! Pete Still no assistant on my Nexus 5X in the UK! LondonLeedsFan Have you set phone language to English US and got latest play services? That will basically push it to your phone within 5 minutes. Pete Latest Play Services (even gone for the beta), same with Google app. As for language, tried that & it didn't work, but why should I? They say it's available in the UK and various other manufacturers (Samsung, OnePlus etc) have made it available on theirs, but Google haven't rolled it out to Nexus devices over here yet. A farce. LondonLeedsFan I have a 6P in the UK and I've had it for about 6 weeks now. Strange. Roderick Gadellaa I don't have it on my Moto X 2014 either and I updated the Google app, Play Services and even edited the build.prop. Somehow it's not working for everyone yet. That said, on the Moto X it may be Moto Voice that's the problem because it also prevents Ok Google hotword detection from anywhere but the Google app itself - it doesn't even work in Google Now On Tap although the searchbar says "Say OK Google". Leonardo Baez create reminder to bitch about you. :,D brian. Careful, she'll turn that insult on you... sbeaulieu The biggest problem assistant got is support. Only one country(officialy). dcdttu Gotta have one before the other, maybe. So that's what they hopefully are going to do next. pfmiller Once you can distinguish between users that's all you should need for both reading and writing appointments. I'm wondering if they are not fully confident in the reliability of the multiple user recognition, so they figure implementing read-only functions is safer while they work on getting the reliability up. denisu So, am I right in saying it can only make calendar disappointments? elchuby Can't even do that. Crystalatracy Managing director of Google!, is explaining to users to start off "Work at home" method, that People have been doing for about one year now. These days alone, I generated close to $36,000 until now with no more than my home computer as well as some spare time, despite that i have a fulltime 9 to 5 job.

Artem Russakovskii (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻ Gaurav Arora Please keep the table back where it was senor_heisenberg Goddamn Aaron Berlin I'm sure that's coming. I'm more excited to find out how they intend to handle messaging, though. surethom I'm sorry but why can Google not do the most simplest things. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Because they're a bunch of overpaid prima donnas who think they're geniuses but can't even match what a simple diligent grunt coder can do. M6 Over 90% of those grunt coders you mention probably couldn't write a simple service that serves a 'hello world' webpage at the thousands of QPS that Google's least popular services have to handle. Most of the work done to spin up such a service are done by SREs not SWEs. This is why start ups can add features so quickly. They simply don't have that many users and can worry about scalability after they get popular, and they have months if not years to work out a scalable solution in the meantime. Also, most grunt coders that add features quickly end up accumulating vast amounts of technical debt in the code they write. Morten Ulv Readers of Android Police are highly trained in pitchforking and kneejerk reactions. No critical thought allowed here, get out! abqnm If I hired an assistant and he or she couldn't add appointments to my calendar, I'd fire that motherfucker on the spot. I guess it must be time to get jobs at Google. Because they sure as shit don't know what an assistant is or what they are supposed to be able to do. Morten Ulv I'm sure they are not aware of the problem and that you would totally be fix it in 5 minutes. That's how it is, I'm sure! Lateef Alabi-Oki I'm just glad that the multiuser support works as well as it does. It hasn't failed in distinguishing the voices in my household. My spouse told it to show pictures from Google Photos and it executed. It's truly magical. Forgive my honeymoon phase. I'll be back to bitching in a day or two. makapav The next thing Google needs to enable us family sharing of all pictures and albums instead of doing it one by one. mustbepbs Still can't even add time to an existing fucking timer. Seriously, this company has the weirdest priorities. makapav Stickers FTW! Duder12 Google literally just tackled the biggest hurdle. Its all game over from here on out for the competition. bozzykid Considering you can hardly do anything with the multi-user support, it isn't even clear if it truly works. Martin Still don't get the point of this trash... If it can't make a simple reminder or cal app... What for people use it? Weather? Time? When you are surrounded or 10 more gadgets doing the same (watch, phone, tv, Pc and many more)... This is why I am never too exited when Google releases something new, it's never good, not even close to what they promise it is going to be... :) Matt Terk I have 3 devices, whole home music is wonderful along with all the assistant functions and control of all my smarthome devices. It would be hard to live without it now. boop It's the cheapest cast-enabled speaker I know of and it works fantastically. The voice commands for pulling up music are also best-in-class. I have a few smart home devices as well and virtually any combination of words construable as a command mumbled from anywhere in the room will do what I want. I doesn't do everything it ought to but it does quite a lot and does it exceptionally well. jdrch Google Home: a solution in desperate search of a problem. Deeco AP is the biggest Android media site, please make articles about all the short comings of Google and shame them until we are heard. Too much crap going on itsatrap Why people buy this thing? Morten Ulv Because these small (but important) issues will get ironed out and Google has a much better potential than Amazon at nailing it. JG What about Hangouts?

Multi-user voice recognition is rolling out to Google Home today Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/04/20 9:01am PDTApr 20, 2017 70 Plus 1 on G+ 125 Share on Facebook 89 Share on Twitter Total Shares284 Google News Videos Update 1: 2017/04/20 12:02pm PDT Here is the setup flow, courtesy of Artem Russakovskii: Bringing Google Assistant out of the phone and dropping it into Google Home comes with some difficulties. Not the least of which is, how do you handle personal account preferences and data when Google Home is available to everyone in the house? Until now the solution has been "don't." Starting today, you can register multiple users with your Google home, which recognizes them by voice. To set this up. look for a device card in the Home app that says"Multi-user is now available" or "Link your account." The setup process has you say the "OK Google" and "Hey Google" hotwords twice each. From then on, Google Home will be able to provide personal results because it knows who you are. The same is true for up to five other people in the house. The personal results affected by multi-user include My Day, calendars, flights, shopping lists, photos, and more. Each user of Google Home will also be asked to set some preferences for things like video and music services. If you set up a new user and don't do that, Google Home just defaults to the ones used by the first account. You can get started fiddling around with this today, but only in the US. Multi-user will roll out to the UK in the coming months.

Evolutionary at best. cusaitech Will this prevent ads from activating Google home? Jonathan Berry I believe unrecognized users will continue to work, just without the personalization it can do if it recognizes you. Shagnscooby I'm wondering if you can specify the default account if it's an unrecognized person. The biggest reason I've been looking forward to this is because of someone in my house using the Google Home for music with GPM and me in the car listening and it stops playing because of simultaneous streams. I'd probably specify one of my kids as the default account so it never overlaps my listening. Kakairo Yes! Can't wait to set this up when I get home. Hopefully adding calendar events and reminders isn't far behind. Carson Saldanha Roll out... :( Kakairo I've been lucky with roll outs lately, hopefully that streak continues. surethom UK coming month not good. Will this FINALLY let us ask for my music uploaded by artist name & song to play without a subscription? Defenestratus Thank goodness. I'm really sick of having my wife's terrible music selections showing up as recommendations in GPM. MrCalifornia If my wife doesn't have her own Google Music subscription can she not play music on Google Home anymore? Lisarbeams Managing director of Google!, is explaining to users to start off "Work at home" method, that People have been doing for about one year now. These days alone, I generated close to $36,000 until now with no more than my home computer as well as some spare time, despite that i have a fulltime 9 to 5 job. Even everyone not used to this, can make $89/per h easily and the earnings can go even higher over time... This is how i started !wr241c: ➽➽ ➽➽➽➽ http://GoogleFinancialCashJobs241BuzzGlobal/GetPaid$97/Hour... ★✫★★✫★✫★★✫★✫★★✫★✫★★✫★✫★★✫★✫★★✫★✫★★✫★✫★★✫★✫★★✫★✫★★✫★✫★★✫:::!wr241u:..... surethom So each person has to upload all there music to each account for Playlists to work? Or can you ask for any Playlists from somone else's music uploaded? Still Google. Does not explain properly. trickytree1984 Same question Scott Olsen I'm guessing I still won't be able to link my work account to my personal account so that I can get both calendar events when I ask about my day. M. Luciano Not without sharing your calendar to the other account. F4LL0U7 My IT department blocks sharing our work calendars externally. gSyncit is the only thing that worked for me, and it works great. I love getting my work meeting agenda & reminders on my personal phone & watch. Check it out. http://www.fieldstonsoftware.com/software/gsyncit4/ lgg4 On this note, whats the best way to manage a gapps vs gmail account? I have my calendar, google drive and play store apps all on my gapps acocunt, but gplay music and non-business stuff on my gmail. Shoudl i try to transfer everything over to my consumer gmail account and just share my biz calendar to personal? I ask this as features seem to be limited at times with gapps accounts and when i linked my gapps with Home (due to my calendar), it says it cannot access my agenda. David Hyman Will this allow me to use my Spotify account on my phone while my wife uses hers on our Google home? jonzey231 As long as she specifies her Spotify account under her profile, I wouldn't see why not. David Hyman If that's the case it would solve such a first world problem for us! Let's hope that's how it works jonzey231 My brother is adding my Fiancee and I to his GPM family plan right now so we can take advantage of this. Previously, we had a $10/mo GPM sub using a shared gmail account. jonzey231 Will be doing this as soon as I get home from work. dcdttu OMG adorable gay couple in ad because Google wants me to buy 1 of these for every square foot of my house. <3 morteum IS THAT THE PIXEL 2???

Morten Ulv My 6P is over two years old and I have both the battery and the bootloop issue. Luckily, in my Norway, phones (and most electronics) have by law a 5 year "extended warranty" (from the seller, not the manufacturer) to protect consumers from issues like this. NexusPhan You're posting on the wrong article. Also, no your 6P is not over two years old as it wasn't released two years ago. Morten Ulv Guess I fucked that up. I bought it used, and my reciept is from march 2015, so that's why. Maybe the preorder date or an error. benjammin03 What does it do with an unrecognized voice? Does it default to a primary account? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ "Google Home Problems With Multi-User Voice, Google Is Looking Into It" Story to be published in 5... 4... 3... Bill Van I can't wait to see if this multi-user update will work with my twin brother. Our voices are so close that we have always had a tough time trying to figure out who is speaking during many recording. I guess I'll find out later this evening but for now my fingers are crossed..... rslh This would be interesting to know. Google is smart, but not sure if it's THAT smart! I would think assigning different hot words for each user would be ideal, but what do I know. trickytree1984 So why the UK delay?

Deeco US only, In the coming months, End of Q4, Rolling out in a couple weeks... We are tired of this shit Google!!! Shai Pal Anyone succeeded in doing this outside of U.S?

Separate shopping lists now? froemer I wonder if multi-user would also make it so that my kids can't adjust the thermostat or mess with the lights? JG OK, now that we have multi-user support...

Starting today, U.S. users can train their Home hubs to recognize up to six different voices and keep profiles on each individual. According to Google’s Yury Pinsky: We’re adding the ability for up to six people to connect their account to one Google Home. So now when I ask my Google Assistant for help, it can distinguish my voice from my wife’s and I can hear my own personal playlists, my own commute time, my own schedule and more. You can use the Google Home app to train your assistant to recognize each of the different voices. After you do, Home will address each person in its records by name and give them customized responses. Ever been to a tech festival? TNW Conference won best European Event 2016 for our festival vibe. See what's in store for 2017. LEARN MORE Hopefully this sophisticated voice recognition system will make hijack-by-advertising less likely. It also gives Home an advantage over Alexa: the latter supports multiple user profiles, but so far it cannot tie a profile to a particular voice. Multiple-user support rolls out to U.S. users today and to U.K. users “in the coming months.” via SearchEngineLand Tomato, tomahto.

Plastc joins the likes of Coin, declaring bankruptcy Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/04/20 2:39pm PDTApr 20, 2017 14 Plus 1 on G+ 45 Share on Facebook 41 Share on Twitter Total Shares100 News Some of you might remember Plastc. They were a company that jumped on the re-programmable credit card train Coin and Google Wallet started in '13 and '12, respectively. They may have been a bit later to the game in 2014 after even Google had decided that it wasn't a good idea anymore, but they made the attempt. Later even the funding-successful Coin had to close shop due to delays, problems, and a general failure to properly keep up with the market. Unlike Coin, though, Plastc never managed to actually deliver on a product. And now just like its forebears, Plastc has decided it's time to die. This news isn't entirely surprising. Plastc's preorder update messages started verging on the Saygus-esqe: making promises of more features and upgrades, and fewer mentions of actual dates. The Plastc subreddit even decided seven months ago that the business had become a scam and was recommending people to steer clear. The company nonetheless raised in excess of $ 9 million in preorders, which is quite a lot to cut and run with. Plastc, unlike Coin, never actually managed to make or deliver a product to anyone who purchased it. Hopefully at least some of the money is left to return to backers. If not, given the quantity of cash there's always the chance of a decent lawsuit against whatever or whoever is left standing after the bankruptcy settles. The full details of their message to those who preordered are too long to quote here, but their bankruptcy statement is included below.Feel free to check out the full details at the source link. We Regret to Inform You... For the past 3 years, our mission here at Plastc was to build and deliver the most technically ambitious smart card on the planet. After making enormous leaps in development, product innovation and progress towards our goal, Plastc has exhausted all of its options to raise the money it needs to continue. Plastc, Inc. is exploring options to file Chapter 7 Bankruptcy and will cease operations on April 20, 2017. While we have fallen short of our goal, we are proud of our team and the effort that went into developing a working Plastc Card. However, without the necessary capital to continue, all employees have been let go, which means that Customer Care and Social Media channels are unmanned or have been shut down.

Is there any recourse to a refund at this point? David Ruddock Declaring bankruptcy probably doesn't bode well for refunds, no. KlausWillSeeYouNow No kidding...But what about people who submitted a refund request before they declared bankruptcy that was never answered? That's the boat I'm in. Ryne Hager Bankruptcy might interfere with that. Thankfully there's always the potential recourse of personal liability on the part of whoever owned the joint. That's gonna depend on something like a class action, though. Christina B. Try your bank and claim fraud. If that don't work a class action lawsuit has been started. Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ You can always try to get your bank or credit card issuer to do a chargeback. Technically they aren't supposed to do it beyond a certain point, but under certain circumstances they may do it for you, even after a couple of years. infiniteh I'm so glad that I got my refund when I did. Aaron Huffman I 'pre ordered' and I've been very excited for it for so long however there is a big thing I have on this. All these news entries are saying raised $9M from backers or pre orders and all that however near the end of the pre order email I have it shows plain as day just as my bank statements: "Your card will be charged at time of shipping." tldr; I was not charged a dime because they weren't shipping. Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ There seems to be differing stories on this. Some email screenshots in /r/plastc don't show that line in the email and the posters have claimed they were in fact charged. If you didn't get charge, count yourself lucky you won't have to deal with the headache of losing $150 and trying to get it back. Aaron Huffman That's all between Stripe payment and Plastc because things just have been working the way they should for me also the Plastc charge has been a gut feeling in me for about 3 years to always keep that $150 in my bank account so I can get my shipment on time when they are ready because I'm not the best at my finances yet. I've been watching my emails and bank like a hawk waiting for either a charge, an update or a decline on my card from Plastc. sbeaulieu Was sure this was a second post about Saygus Ryne Hager Thank David for the picture idea. crutchcorn Why is Mr. Davenport standing on the tombstone?

Because the Galaxy S series is the second-most popular line of smartphones on earth, its audience is unashamedly mainstream, and the vast majority of sales of these devices will be to consumers who aren't what you'd call tech-savvy. The issue for Samsung, increasingly, is learning how to split the difference between a smartphone that provides a good experience for everybody and maintaining that all important credibility with its fans and enthusiasts. The Galaxy S8 and S8+, for example, have Quad HD displays - the best ones I've ever seen. But they're set to 1080p by default for improved performance. And as enthusiasts clamor for ever-larger batteries, Samsung has put very average, if not exactly small, ones in these new phones (though they should degrade less noticeably). The S8 is still a slippery metal and glass sandwich that essentially requires additional protection unless you like to live life on the edge, which is great news for case manufacturers, but less so for you and me. And then there's the new fingerprint scanner, which is just a bit tragic (especially on the S8+). Of course, there are big upsides: the latest chipset from Qualcomm, the Snapdragon 835, ensures that the Galaxy S8 will probably have the best LTE performance of any phone on the market here in the US. That chip also brings features like Bluetooth 5.0, improved Wi-Fi performance, and better image signal processors for the cameras. Samsung's Infinity Display is genuinely breathtaking: this is the best screen I've seen on a smartphone, period. The rear-facing camera is still great, the quality of the phone itself seems almost unimpeachable, and Samsung continues to make legitimate value-adds to the smartphone experience with features like Samsung Pay, wireless charging, and advanced network feature support across all four major US carriers. The fact that you can just walk in to a store and buy one generally speaking (ahem, Google) is something worth pointing out, too. Samsung's ubiquity is absolutely a product feature. Like the S7 and S7 edge last year, the S8 and S8+ feel iterative - in a good way. But I also believe they're evidence that what makes a smartphone "great" is becoming more and more subjective. These are great smartphones, but how great really depends a lot on your priorities. The Good Display The best displays I've ever seen on a smartphone. They're bright, they're beautiful, they have excellent viewing angles, and tiny little bezels. You get a ton of screen in a remarkably compact package. Battery I only tested the S8+ in depth, but the battery life on this phone was great. If you disable the always-on display, it gets even better. Camera While I still prefer the Pixel's camera, the S8's has its own strengths, including excellent low-light performance, fast captures, and bright, vivid colors. GraceUX isn't bad TouchWiz has come a long way. Setting aside the conversation about updates, I find GraceUX perfectly good, and Samsung has genuine value-adds in the software these days. Virtual keys FINALLY. Samsung has entered the modern Android era and given us virtual navigation keys. It has noticeably improved my feelings about using a Samsung phone. The Not So Good Fingerprint scanner I actively hate the fingerprint scanner on the S8+. It may be better on the standard S8. But yeah, it's bad. Updates The S8 and S8+ ship with Android 7.0, and I've seen exactly nothing from Samsung indicating they plan to change their attitude about timely Android platform updates. Bixby Is utterly worthless. A waste of a perfectly good hardware key. So much glass I would seriously worry about breaking this phone if I bought it. There is so much glass - Samsung phones essentially require cases. Pricey At $750 and $850 for the S8 and S8+, respectively, there's no denying Samsung is asking a lot for the privilege of joining the Galaxy S club this year. Design and materials Not all glass and metal sandwiches are created equal. With the S8 and S8+, Samsung has proven once again that, yes, there is still room for refinement when it comes to packaging and polishing a smartphone. To call these phones "pretty" would be to do them a disservice (I also don't necessarily think it's true). They have an almost precious quality to them, something that tends to be strongly evoked when you hold them in the slightly awkward "claw" grip a curved-edge smartphone sort of requires. But the phones look and feel so solid - their seams so uniform and tight - that you get the sense they can't even be taken apart, because they must have been forged whole in some kind of dark ritual (especially in this black finish). I don't mean to fawn, but when you compare Samsung's industrial design here on the S8+ to something like the Google Pixel XL, the Pixel looks and feels like yesterday's smartphone. And I don't just mean the bezels. Compare it to the Galaxy S7 edge, and the new S8+ is clearly a more moderate step forward, though. The biggest change is of course the display, which we will get to soon, but let's talk about those bezels. Samsung hasn't made what you'd call a "bezellless" phone (no one has), but their bezel reduction approach is more similar to LG's than, say, Xiaomi's. Instead of making the ludicrous compromise of moving the front-facing camera and various sensors down to the chin of the phone and messing with the earpiece speaker just to achieve that not-bezelless look, Samsung's chopped off some bezel on both the top and bottom. The result is much more screen in a package that doesn't need to grow dramatically to accommodate it. This is the smart approach to maximizing screen to body ratio (conversely, I would argue the Xiaomi approach is not smart). The one compromise Samsung had to make was the home button - it was time for it to go. We'll talk more about the software keys later, but for those of you who liked to tap the home key to quickly check your notifications, be at ease: it has a replacement. The pressure-sensitive, always-on virtual home key can be configured to wake the screen on a double tap or long press for quick glances. As you know, this also means the fingerprint scanner had to be put... somewhere else. Samsung hasn't chosen well. The fingerprint scanner on the Galaxy S8+, in particular, is nothing short of a bad experience. My success rate on reads hovers around 50% at the time of this writing, and it's become a frustration so constant that I've started to feel a bit annoyed by the whole thing. Why couldn't it have gone in a more natural, isolated location below the camera sensor? It's not just the reach - the scanner itself is incredibly finicky about making sure the whole sensor area is covered, and sometimes just doesn't recognize my finger is on it at all. This is not to mention that said scanner is right next to the camera, which has the same sort of raised edge design as the scanner and feels exactly the same to your finger. Unlocking the S8+ with your right hand requires immense discipline and active attention to how you grasp the phone. It isn't even worth the trouble (my fingers are pretty long, by the way). With your left, it's doable as you build up the muscle memory instead of having to actively feel out the scanner. But I use a lot of phones, and this is hands down the worst fingerprint scanner I have used since Samsung's old swipe-to-read ones. It boggles my mind how far backward Samsung has gone with this experience. Even the registration process is annoying: it refused to read any of my attempts to register the sides and edges of my finger because the scanner wasn't completely covered. Anyway, that's my fingerprint scanner rant. Samsung, you messed this up. On the bottom of the phone you'll find the 3.5mm headphone jack, a USB 3.0 Type C port, the microphone, and the outlet for the speaker. The design of the power key is unchanged, but Samsung has switched back to a rocker for the volume key to avoid confusion with the new Bixby button. The buttons all provide good feedback and have a nice, clicky feel. I will say the volume rocker is a bit high up on the S8+, presumably in order to make room for said Bixby key. Out back, the camera hump is gone, meaning you can tap away at the S8 sitting on a flat surface and it won't rock or wobble (at least, not significantly). To the right of the sensor is the fingerprint scanner, and to the left is the flash and Samsung's weirdly persistent heart-rate monitor. On the front, things have become substantially more subdued with this generation of phone. The earpiece speaker is much smaller, the Samsung logo is nowhere to be found (a victory, I would say), and there's no chroming or accents around any of the sensors or front-facing camera. All colors of the Galaxy S8 have black bezels around the screen, so no matter which shade you choose, you'll get a pretty stealthy fascia. Undoubtedly, some of you are coming into this review with a question: S8, or S8+? If you're currently using a Galaxy Note5, S6 edge+, or S7 edge, I would actually advise you to consider the S8 over the larger model I'm testing here. The S8+ is a big phone - as tall as a Nexus 6, if not nearly as wide. This will make pocketability a genuine question for some, especially if you're going to be throwing a case on this big, expensive slab of metal and glass. If you typically find yourself liking a 5.5-5.7" smartphone, I'd say go for the regular S8. But if you do want something bigger, the S8+ offers a ton of screen in a package that is a lot easier to handle than phablets (sorry, sorry) of the past. Because all of the extra display area is packaged vertically, the phone is still very narrow and easy to manage with one hand - for most tasks. Reaching the top of the screen can be a real bear, and that can mean risky maneuvers (i.e., potentially dropping it) to access certain parts of the UI one-handed. I still think it's way easier to manipulate than my old Nexus 6, though. The comparative narrowness makes my grip on it a lot more confidence-inspiring, even if those stretches for the notification bar can feel a bit dicey. And because I wasn't sure where else to put it: Yes, the multi-color notification LED is still there. Even with the reduced bezel, Samsung managed to hold onto it. Display If you're sick and tired of hearing every year that "Samsung has done it again - the best smartphone display ever!" then I am sorry, you will continue to be sick and tired. The Galaxy S8 and S8+ have the best smartphone screens. Ever. They get extremely bright, the colors are exceptionally vivid (or accurate, if you switch to the Basic display mode), viewing angles are excellent, blacks are very deep, and the AMOLED panel can get ultra-dim for those late-night reading sessions. Samsung continues to demonstrate that its Super AMOLED technology is the gold standard for displays with the Galaxy S8, and that the bar can still be raised higher yet. I'm always impressed with Samsung's ability to iterate this technology with such consistent success. While this is a Quad HD panel with a native resolution of 2960x1440 (that's a lot of pixels), Samsung configures the S8 and S8+ out of the box to run at 1080p (2220x1080). Why? Because it improves performance. And that feels like something of a copout, doesn't it? Google can run the Pixel XL with its older, less efficient Snapdragon 821 chip at full QHD resolution and achieve performance and battery life that go toe-to-toe with a fresh-out-of-the-box Galaxy S8+. So, why make the phones QHD at all? VR! At least, that's a convenient scapegoat. Notably, you can change the resolution manually to the full QHD. I'll have a few more words about this in the performance section of the review, so stay tuned. Getting back to the screen, I found it worked well even in direct sunlight, with Samsung's ultra-high contrast overboost mode kicking in to maximize readability even in the most challenging conditions. Sure, that'll drain your battery real fast, but it's better than not being able to see your phone. The Galaxy S8s also have support for HDR video, but I believe it's only the HDR10 standard (not Dolby Vision). As far as I know, this will work with select apps that have specifically optimized for Samsung devices, so I would expect adoption of this in a wide way will be fairly slow for the time being outside the core video services like Netflix and Amazon. Still, it's good to have, because the screens on these phones really do deserve HDR video to fully take advantage of their impressive capabilities - especially those positively inky black levels. I applaud Samsung for continuing to include its helpful screen mode setting, which allows you to choose one of four color profile presets depending on how you want the screen to look. The "basic" mode offers the most unforgivingly accurate reproduction of colors, something I find helpful when reviewing photos. Finally, let's talk about the edge. Last year, I was pretty clear on my feelings about the Galaxy S7 edge having issues properly rejecting fingers or palms at the edge of the display. Because of the way curved-edge displays are shaped and the fact that Samsung curves both the front and the back of the device, it's essentially impossible to hold a curved-edge phone without your fingers or palms touching the edge of the screen. On the S7 edge, this was absolutely maddening at times. It made the phone nearly impossible for me to use if I was lying on my back, for example, doing some email in bed, and it was one of the reasons I stopped using it so quickly after my review period. I am happy to report that it looks like Samsung has given some serious attention to the issue of edge rejection. I tapped out a full email on the S8+ lying back on the couch and didn't get a single misread character or failure to respond to input. I browsed the web, scrolled through Twitter, did some texting, and it all went off without a hitch. That's cause for a sigh of relief - I was really worried Samsung would just continue to act like this issue didn't exist. Battery life and charging I've only been using the Galaxy S8+, so that's the phone I can give you battery life impressions on. My take so far is that battery life is at least as good as the Snapdragon Galaxy S7 edge from last year, a phone that offered above-average performance in this area. In single-day heavy use, the phone could reliably get 5 hours of screen time, sometimes creeping closer to 6 hours. That's very good - exceeding the Pixel XL in performance, even. Will the Exynos variant once again clean Qualcomm's clock on efficiency? I guess we'll have to see how they compare in reviews around the web. Still, the S8+ does really well here, and if you want the version of the phone that's going to be able to power you through the most usage possible, that extra 500mAh of capacity (3500mAh total for the S8+) over the standard S8 isn't anything to sneeze at - and I doubt the larger display cannibalizes all of it. Samsung has also claimed that these batteries should hold up better over the long haul than those in last year's phones, saying that the S8 and S8+ will retain 95% of their effective capacity after a full year of typical usage (the S7 retained just 80%). That's welcome news, because as we all know, battery life doesn't tend to get better as a phone ages. The idle drain on the S8+ wasn't particularly great in my experience, but that's because I had the always-on display enabled. Samsung estimated on the S7 that you'd drain under 1% of your battery per hour with the feature turned on, so I think those of you really looking to get every bit of battery bang for your buck possible will want to turn this off. It does have an effect. I also turned off Samsung's very annoying app "sleep" feature, which looks at apps that are using power in the background but that you don't use regularly and then forces them into an "sleep" state to prevent them from waking the phone. It's well-intentioned, I know, but if I want something like that, I tend to trust Greenify, and honestly, I'm generally OK with letting Android's Doze do its work. Finally, just as a note: all of my testing was done in the standard 1080p mode the phone ships in - I've not turned up the resolution to full QHD. Obviously, if you do this, your battery life will suffer as a result of the increased number of pixels which need to be rendered (apparently not - it's just performance). However, I really can't be sure just how big an effect this will have, and it's not a particularly easy thing to test outside of a highly controlled environment. Charging the S8 and S8+ is just the same as it's been for years with the Galaxy line of phones, using Samsung's Adaptive Fast Charge technology based on Qualcomm Quick Charge 2.0. The one change comes in the port, which is now a USB-C connector. Oh, and Samsung has made the charging bricks and cables black now, instead of white. It charges at the same speed all Samsung phones with Adaptive Fast Charge have over the years, and the charger still has a Type A USB port. Samsung says the retention of the older charging tech and Type A port is to make transitioning from legacy products easier for their customers, and it looks like the S8 will even include a microUSB to type C adapter tip in the box. When you sell as many smartphones to "normals" as Samsung, these are very valid considerations, and so while enthusiasts might be a bit miffed than Qualcomm Quick Charge 4.0 and USB Power Delivery aren't in tow here, it's not like the phones charge slowly. Samsung also still includes wireless charging, and it is releasing a new wireless fast charging pad which provides the same speed as the fast charging pad for the S7 did last year. This year, the pad has a rubbery, leather-texture surface and pops up to act as a phone stand, which is kind of cool. Wireless charging is available on all Galaxy S8 models, too - no worrying about regional variants here. Storage, wireless, and call quality The Galaxy S8 and S8+ come with as much storage as you'd like - as long as it's 64GB. There's only one storage tier being offered in the US (I wouldn't be surprised if China gets a 128GB model), but you can expand that with a microSD card. I really will hand it to Samsung for upping their base offering to 64GB - 32GB just doesn't cut it these days, and 128GB can seem a bit overkill. This T-Mobile variant I tested came with 53GB of that available to the user out of the box, which should be more than enough for most of us. Wireless performance on the phone has been excellent for me. Data speeds on T-Mobile have been great, and the Galaxy S8 and S8+ support a large number of advanced network technologies here in the US to ensure you're getting the most possible out of your carrier's network. Be it advanced LTE carrier aggregation, wireless MIMO, VoLTE, HD Voice, Wi-Fi calling, LTE-U - it's all here. You can thank Qualcomm's X16 LTE modem for most of this. A lot of things can be said of Samsung, but they rarely ever miss out on a chance to be a showcase for the carriers' newest features. T-Mobile, for example, says the S8 and S8+ will be the fastest-ever smartphones on its network thanks to 4x4 MIMO, carrier aggregation, and 256 QAM support. Wi-Fi performance on the S8+ has been great for me, and Bluetooth in my car has been flawless, providing strong reception and zero pairing issues (something that can't be said of certain phones starting with "P"). I've come to expect Samsung to get Bluetooth right over the years, and they still are. Bluetooth 5.0 support is on board courtesy of the Snapdragon 835 chipset, but no real consumer devices out there using the standard exist yet. But you can take advantage of some of the standard's increased power right now - for example, Samsung has introduced a new feature called dual audio that lets you stream to two pairs of Bluetooth headphones at once. That's pretty awesome. Audio and speakers The Snapdragon 835 features a newer revision of Qualcomm's Aqstic audio "codec" (basically, the DAC and headphone amplifier), and I do think some noticeable gains have been made here. For one, I feel output on the headphone jack is better - driving big, high-impedance headphones left me with more room on the volume slider than attempting to play the same tracks with my Pixel XL. I also might be hearing some improved bass response, but that could just be the extra "oomf" the new amplifier is providing. Quality itself is still excellent, and I really noticed no difference on that front between the 821 and 835. Annoyingly, Samsung's volume warning still won't let you exceed a certain threshold until you accept a warning dialogue saying you might blow out your ears. It is very annoying. I realize there are laws on the books about this in Europe, but why does this have to be in the firmware for every variant of the phone, and why does it have to tell you every time you plug in a set of headphones? That's certainly not the case with Apple or Google's phones here, but Samsung seems dogged in its resistance to this regional accommodation. Samsung doesn't seem to have really done much with its external speaker. It sounds decent, but the direction it fires and the peak output leave a fair bit to be desired. In the age of waterproofed smartphones with itty-bitty bezels, it's hard to see speakers being a major priority anymore. It's sad, but it's true. Camera I was a fan of the camera on the Galaxy S7 and S7 edge, though I do still have my critiques as they've aged: colors are exaggerated and processing can be overbearing. Samsung claims that while the camera in the S8 and S8+ is the same one found in last year's phones, they've done work on the processing side to increase image quality. What does that mean, exactly? For my eyeballs, it means less aggressive sharpening. As with last year's phones, the S8 is an incredibly capable camera in low light conditions. The f/1.7 lens hoovers up a surprising amount of light even in challenging conditions, and with a steady hand you can get some pretty crisp shots where other phones would just render an unpleasing mess of noise and blur. Even Google's Pixel is no match for the S7 in low light - the dual-pixel autofocus and aforementioned lens make a formidable duo in the dark. Photos shoot off fast and the camera launches quickly, though I had honestly hoped for some improvement in speed given the new Spectra ISP the Snapdragon 835 features. In fact, the Galaxy S8's camera still doesn't launch as consistently quickly as my Pixel XL's, especially when using the quick launch feature, where the Pixel XL is very noticeably faster on the draw. That's... not great. It's still quick to start up, but you'd think Samsung would be focusing on this kind of stuff in terms of trying to be the best. Previous Next When we get to the actual business of the photos, I think nearly everyone who buys this phone will be incredibly happy with how their snapshots turn out. They're vivid, crisp, and as I said, the results in challenging light are still as impressive today as they were last year. I definitely approve of Samsung's reduction in the amount of sharpening applied to photos - things just look more natural now. The colors are still a bit unrealistic at times, and Samsung's automatic HDR is nowhere near as impressive as Google's HDR+, meaning you'll still get blowouts in particularly high-contrast scenarios. But the camera is good. In terms of the app experience, Samsung has added Snapchat-like overlays and stickers (for joy), but aside from a new option to place a floating shutter button on the UI, the camera app is essentially unchanged from how it appears on the Galaxy S7's current Nougat build with Grace UX. That means you get a Pro mode with a few more shooting options (including RAW output), filters, slow motion, panorama, hyperlapse, and more. All in all, the camera experience on the S8 hasn't really changed much this year, and while I wouldn't call that a letdown, per se, I don't think Samsung had the best smartphone camera last year overall, and leaving it essentially unchanged for 2017 means it probably won't this year, either. Performance The version of the Galaxy S8+ I'm testing uses Qualcomm's Snapdragon 835 chipset, not the Samsung Exynos chip that many other markets around the world will get. If you want to know about the 835's capabilities on paper, we have an extensive post benchmarking its performance. In the real world, the Galaxy S8 and S8+ are the very first smartphones to utilize Qualcomm's new chip. How's that gone? Well, I am happy to report that the Galaxy S8+ I'm testing is very noticeably faster than an S7 edge with a fairly fresh Nougat install. It's a pretty stark difference. Has Samsung conquered the infamous lag its devices develop over longer periods of time? I can't answer that today, obviously, and Samsung really isn't interested in discussing it, either. As more reviewers and eventually consumers spend more time with the phone, we'll be able to better assess that issue. That said, out of the box, the Galaxy S8+ feels almost as quick as my Google Pixel XL. A little faster in some scenarios, too, but I would say the two phones offer reasonably comparable performance based on the week I had to really compare the two. The Pixel XL isn't what I'd call the fastest Android phone for raw speed (I'd say the OnePlus 3T wins there), but it's the consistency of its performance that has really impressed me in the last six months. If Samsung can keep even close to this level of performance on the Galaxy S8 six months from now, that'd be a huge boost for the user experience on its phones. That is, unless you really heat up the S8+. Between benchmark testing runs, I noticed the phone developed the very typical kind of lag I'd found on devices like the Galaxy S7 edge last year. The Pixel doesn't do this. The OnePlus 3T doesn't do this. Why are Samsung phones so aggressively throttling under thermal load? Still, the number of times I worked the phone hard enough in regular use for this to be an issue were negligible - as in, it really didn't happen at all outside the back-to-back benchmarking scenario. One performance asterisk I'd like to point out is that the Galaxy S8 and S8+ do give themselves something of an edge on phones like the G6 and Pixel XL inherently, because they run at 1080p resolution out of the box instead of the 1440p every other QHD phone does, but you really can't tell the difference 95% of the time. On the whole, I'm satisfied with how this phone performs. During the hands-on event, I was much more tepid, as I just didn't have the time to really get a feel, especially comparatively, for the overall smoothness and consistency of the experience. There are, however, some areas where I think Samsung could improve. The way the notification shade draws down feels a bit clunky (not slow, just weird), and sometimes the virtual navigation keys have a split-second delay on interaction. It's also definitely a bit easier to choke up the S8+ with manic opening and closing of apps than the Pixel XL - it does start to get a little overwhelmed when you really, really push it. I also think Google is doing a better job on touch latency, as sometimes the S8+ feels just a bit behind my fingers. As for benchmarks, you probably won't be surprised to learn Samsung's implementation of the Snapdragon 835 isn't as fast as Qualcomm's reference device. I've pasted a results table for popular tests below.

Instead I'm going to devote this section to brief thoughts on thoughts I've had when using the phone - specific, relatively concise observations about what the Galaxy S8+ is like to use. The fingerprint scanner is too hard to reach on the S8+, misreads are common. You may smudge the camera lens when reaching for the scanner, meaning blurry photos if you're not an obsessive lens wiper like me. I tried to use the iris scanner, but it was even worse than the fingerprint sensor with my glasses, my hit rate was well under 20%. Unlike with the Pixel, Bluetooth performance in my car ('16 Mazda) was great - I didn't even need to take the phone out of my pocket. The S8+ is fairly easy to keep a grip on width-wise, but it is very tall, and pulling down on the notification bar one-handed just feels risky. The top area of my homescreen is basically a no man's land for the same reason. I can't say I actually care the phone renders in 1080p by default, you can't really tell. I didn't end up using the always-on home button feature at all, even though it is kind of neat. If I bought this phone, I'd turn off always-on display to keep the idle battery drain lower. While not the newest or fastest standard, Samsung's 15 watt fast charging still tops up the phone pretty quickly in my experience. On the launcher, the Samsung Pay quick-access peeking thing reduces the size of the touch targets for the nav keys. I switched the navigation key order to the traditional Android layout (back, home, recent apps) and haven't looked back. Samsung's new launcher looks alright but I went straight to Nova, in part to get my round icons back (yes, I have been Pixel indoctrinated). I don't know how anyone lives with the stock Samsung keyboard. Yikes. Even with all this extra vertical space, I still can't find a single compelling reason to split-screen apps on Android. Samsung still isn't allowing "OK Google" hotword recognition when the display is off (probably because Bixby). Software For the purpose of this review, much of my definition of "new" is going to rely on what is new versus a Galaxy S7 running Samsung's GraceUX update on Android 7.0. So with that in mind, let's get to it. What's new Navigation keys The biggest change, of course, is down at the bottom of the screen: virtual navigation keys! I'm not going to get caught up on how they look - I just care that they're there and they work. And you can change them to the proper back-home-recents order, which I did immediately upon setting up the phone. Choice feels good. You can also change the background color for the navbar if you're so inclined. The home button has a few extra tricks up its sleeve, too. It's always on - even if the always-on display mode is off and your screen isn't illuminated, there's a pressure sensitive area where the home button displays. Just press with some force (the amount of force can be adjusted in settings), and your phone will wake up just like you'd pressed a physical home button. You can see why rumors are swirling that Samsung wanted to integrate a fingerprint scanner with this feature - it would make complete sense. The home key will also respond to hard presses even when an app is overlaying the navbar. Honestly, I didn't end up using the hard press feature pretty much ever. You can also set it up to just display the lockscreen on a double-tap of the button. (Which is fine, but seems an inferior solution to tapping anywhere on the display to do a wake as LG, HTC, and other phones do.) Bixby *cracks knuckles.* OK, let's talk about Samsung's intelligent assistant... thing. Bixby exists in three incarnations on the Galaxy S8 at this time. First, there is Bixby Home (Google Now). Then, there is Bixby Reminders (which is, well, reminders). And then we have Bixby Vision (Google Goggles). We'll talk about each of them, I guess. Bixby's banner feature, voice controls, is not available at the time of this review, and will supposedly launch here in the US later this Spring. For now, then, all the Bixby button does is launch Bixby Home.    Bixby Home is the most involved of the three, so let's begin there. Bixby Home is a bit like someone took your Google Now feed and made it less useful. It displays recent photos you've taken, advertises themes on Samsung's Galaxy Apps store, suggests wallpapers, gives you unnecessarily large calendar event cards, displays random GIFs from giphy (why), gives you a list of your most frequently visited websites (if you use Samsung's browser), as well as your most frequently used apps. There's also weather, your step count (helpful), and news served from Flipboard (which you can remove entirely). Currently, Bixby home integrates with a few third-party apps, too. Spotify, Twitter, Uber, Giphy, Facebook, CNN, and Foursquare all can pipe in data to the Bixby Home app if they're installed on your device. Of note: Bixby Home by default can run from your lockscreen, though Samsung does disable cards that might contain personally identifying information like your contacts or calendar. Bixby Home does look kind of nice, so there's that, but I just don't see anybody using this. Google Now is helpful for the deep insights it has about your habits and interests based on the fact that Google knows an insanely creepy amount about what you do on the internet. Samsung will probably never be able to get that deep. Then, we've got Bixby Reminders. Bixby Reminders is exactly what it sounds like: you can set a reminder to do something, including based on a time or location. There are roughly, I don't know, a billion apps and services out there that do this much more robustly and with far more powerful features. I don't see any reason to care about Bixby Reminders unless you're a big fan of Bixby Home, which is where you will be able to find said Bixby Reminders. Finally, there's Bixby Vision. You use it by opening the camera app and pressing the Bixby Vision button. Right now, Bixby Vision can identify wine. I tried a bottle, it didn't work. Bixby Vision can also identify text for translation. That's kind of nice. Bixby Vision can identify objects. I showed it a Galaxy S7. It gave me results for iPads. And it can read QR codes, because it's 2017 and we're still using those. So, yes, it really is just Google Goggles but kind of different (and worse?). You can probably safely ignore Bixby for now, but maybe voice commands will make it actually somewhat useful when they do arrive. Try not to hit the button accidentally, though - I'm doing it all the time and it's getting kind of annoying. Snap window Snap windows is an interesting attempt by Samsung to make Android's splitscreen functionality suck less when you're using it to watch video. Let's say you're watching something in YouTube but you also want to keep texting someone without interrupting your video. You could use Android's built-in splitscreening to do this, but every time you pop out the keyboard in the chat app, your video is going to get pushed around and interrupted and reload constantly. It's a bad experience, and kind of shows just what a sorry state multitasking really still is in on the platform.    Snap window is a band-aid, of sorts, on that problem. With your video player open and the video in view (in portrait mode), open the multitasking UI and the card for the video app should have a third icon to the left of the splitscreen button. Hit that, and you're given a crop interface. Move the rectangle over the area where the video is playing, adjust the size if necessary, and hit "done." At this point, the video will "pin" to the top of the screen, and the lower part of the interface becomes the app switcher. Pick an app, and you're off and running - the video won't move at all even if you pop out the keyboard, and plays back smoothly. I have no idea how this really works, but Samsung clearly understood that video was a pain point in the Android splitscreen experience, and this makes it much better. I can't say I'll use it, but given all that vertical screen space on the S8+, I'm sure someone wants to know about this. Snap window works with any app, of course, but video is the most obvious application. Dual audio Thanks to Bluetooth 5.0, the Galaxy S8 can transmit the same audio to two pairs of Bluetooth audio devices at once. This could be great for watching movies or listening to music on a plane together, for example. I tested it, and it works. Samsung does note that because you only get one volume slider to adjust on the phone, the output level to each connected Bluetooth device will probably vary, and you'll need to adjust the device volume for individual control. Still, it's pretty cool. Separate app sound This is another one I found digging around in Samsung's labyrinthine settings menu: a new feature called separate app sound. I know, this sounds boring, but hold on - it may actually solve a problem that's been bugging you for years. Streaming music over Bluetooth is convenient, but it does tend to come with a catch: your device can't play any other media audio when you're streaming music, because that'll pause the player app. So if you want to play a game or watch a video silently on your phone while you're streaming tunes to a Bluetooth speaker or headphones, you can't - there's only one media channel. This fixes that. Once separate app sound is enabled, you can select one app and make it the exclusive media audio provider to a connected Bluetooth device. So, if you want to make sure Play Music is coming through your Bluetooth speaker, pick the Play Music app and select the Bluetooth device, and only that app will be allowed to send media audio to that speaker while this setting is enabled. (Notification audio, unfortunately, is not blocked - that will still come through.) But, now you can open up YouTube, a game, or browse the web on phone while Play Music is going without worrying about pausing your Bluetooth stream, as all other media audio will play directly through the device speaker instead. This is a pretty decent idea. Other changes I've got some smaller features and changes I discovered, and I'll list them out here. Fingerprint scanner can be set to pull down the notification shade and, from the home screen, to launch Samsung Pay by swiping up. Face unlock mode Always-on display mode has some very slight aesthetic tweaks. That's really it. The software changes versus the current GraceUX OS on the GS7 and S7 edge are pretty minor. General UI (launcher, notifications, lockscreen, navigation keys) The notification tray is essentially unchanged from the current version of Samsung's skin running on a Galaxy S7, though the launcher is all-new version of TouchWiz Home that uses a swipe-up (or down, actually) app drawer a la Pixel. Samsung has also implemented some kind of ape on launcher shortcuts, but they're not really launcher shortcuts - they're just a bunch of actions you can take on the icon. For example, you can multi-select icons in the launcher, remove a shortcut, sleep an app, uninstall it, or go to the info screen. It's kind of handy, really, but I'm not sure it could easily coexist with Android's app shortcuts - the list of items would get really long. In lieu of Google Now, the TouchWiz launcher has a pane for Bixby home to the left of the first homescreen. Yay.    Like me, you're probably going to toss off that stock launcher almost immediately, so I won't dive in too deep. It seems like a fine launcher as OEM launchers go, but if you want any kind of customization, you've still got to go third party. The recent apps menu is the same as you'll find on any up to date S7, and the lockscreen has seen a slight visual refresh, though still offers the same shortcuts for the dialer, Samsung Pay, and the camera app. Of note: Samsung takes a more conservative approach with whether or not it will stretch apps into "full-screen" mode on this new, longer display. There's an area in the settings menu where you can force toggle apps to display in the full UI space, as I've noticed many, even some Google apps, are not set to by default. I forced this on for all my apps and haven't had any issues, but your mileage may vary. Software: Opinion I really don't mind GraceUX. Samsung doesn't mess with stock Android too much these days from a strictly functional perspective. I don't like that I have to disable some things like Samsung's app sleeping, touch sounds, or navigation button order - but here's the thing: I can. There are very few things which I cannot change about the software experience on the Galaxy S8 that are genuine annoyances. Don't like the launcher? Throw on a new one. Don't care for Bixby? Ignore it. Almost every potential software negative on this phone is either easily replaced or simply kept out of sight and out of mind.    Throw on your own launcher, set up Samsung Pay, and try to ignore that you'll probably be seeing "7.0" on this screen for a while - that's my advice. Meanwhile, Samsung adds genuinely useful features like Samsung Pay, screen modes, its dual audio Bluetooth feature, game modes, fingerprint scanner gestures, face recognition, a system-level audio EQ, tons of various configuration options, and more all packaged in what is probably the most technologically advanced smartphone on sale right now. That's not small potatoes. The one sticking point for me, though, is the Android version. The Galaxy S8 ships with Android 7.0, already a version and change behind. Samsung seems to have no interest in changing its approach to platform updates, and that's disappointing. I guess we'll see how they handle things with the S8 and S8+, but I don't have my hopes up. Additionally, while performance is decent out of the gate, I really think we should be demanding more. "Almost as good as the Pixel" is not huge praise considering this phone runs a next-generation chipset and renders the OS at a fraction the resolution a Pixel does. These aren't small concerns for the enthusiast set, but I don't think they're at all fatal to the phones. They're just worth considering. Value In essence, the Galaxy S8 and S8+ retail for $750 and $850, respectively, here in the US. That's a chunk of change more than an LG G6, though that phone does only come with 32GB of storage and features an older chipset. I think that considering the advanced display, processor, and level of quality Samsung is delivering, the prices are totally justifiable. Now, that doesn't mean they're not expensive phones - they are. Really, really expensive phones. But the standard S8 to me is more the competitor to the G6 and Pixel XL, while the S8+ sort of stands on its own as a direct challenge to the iPhone 7 Plus. Many people may not find the size of the S8+ very practical - it really is quite tall. Samsung phones also mean a glut of accessory choices for things like cases, full compatibility with any US carrier (including advanced network features), and more attention from 3rd-party developers in terms of ensuring apps run as they should. These aren't trivial things, even if they may not often go into the traditional smartphone value assessment. Is there nearly $300 more hardware in a Galaxy S8 than a OnePlus 3T? Of course not. But that's not really the question anyone is seriously asking. I think Samsung is charging a pretty penny for the S8 and S8+, but I also think they're doing more to convince the average consumer than, say, Google, that the price of admission is actually worth it. Conclusion The Galaxy S8 and S8+ are great smartphones, I have no doubt of this. Are they great smartphones for everyone? That's a question that, as an Android enthusiast myself, I have a harder time sounding decisive answering. I really like the Infinity Display. I like the very good battery life. I don't mind GraceUX - it's fine! I like the cameras, I like the quality of the phone itself, and I like the new software navigation keys. I have a harder time accepting the update situation and the already-slightly-shaky performance. These things give me genuine pause. But if they don't concern you - and they may well not - it's hard to find truly major faults with these phones. Samsung has done an excellent job building upon and refining the formula that it... built upon and refined with the S7 and S7 edge. The S8+ is probably a little big for most people, but I like that Samsung is offering a "real" big phone in its mainstream lineup. And if you don't want a "big" phone, the standard S8 really is very manageable. Samsung has built two excellent smartphones with the S8 and S8+. We're awarding both the S8 and S8+ our editor's choice "Most Wanted" accolade as well. Whether or not that gets you excited really comes down to what you value in a phone. For me? I'm still pretty happy with my Pixel XL. But if I was shopping today, I'd give the S8, or the S8+, a long, hard look. Tags galaxy 8 review galaxy s8 review subscribe ...

Marty Just for interest since you used Geekbench, my Honor 8 got this score. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/4b179b912ffc406ee06b6dff18a2017929f27362c4f2d6b7945c1341904cf980.png Mark Whelan my Mate 9 scored 1859 single core 6474 multi-core I still think the battery life is going to be just average on these new Samsung phones on the Snapdragon chipset...I get a solid 36 hours out of my phone with 8 hrs screen time. S8+ will get 5 hours most likely on a 15 hr day...and badly needing the charger.... What's the point of a QHD screen if you ship it running 1080p? Marty My opinion is that Huawei's going to displace Samsung as the top Android OEM since they are making such good phones. iKon Agreed, Huawei are slowly climbing up, they already in top 3 and it won't take long to get past apple. Anon probably in just a year or 2 to overtake Apple. It will still take quite a while to displace Samsung. 4 years? Marty If Sammy keeps languishing with their mobile division, it won't take 4 years. Samsung's software, while brimming with features, just isn't good. The only software Sammy has put out that's above and beyond anything else in its class is an app: Samsung Internet Beta. Dubs816 lmaoooooo dickchao Yeah these guys are delusional lol Marty By the way, the resolution is selectable. I'm pretty sure the S8 wouldn't be locked to FHD. Steve McQueen Love my Mate 9. Getting 8-9 hours of SOT is pretty nice. And I love not having to worry about battery life even during a 20 hour day. Stu Would you recommend this phone? I'm thinking of grabbing it the next time it's on sale. Marty Absolutely. It's one of the best phones I've ever owned. It's gorgeous, superbly made, feels good in the hand and is probably the fastest phone I've used. The fingerprint scanner is amazingly quick. The phone works so well too. If you don't mind an Android phone more similar to an iPhone, this is it. The system pretty much looks more like an iPhone than any Android. But it doesn't lack features like an iPhone would. My opinion why the Honor 8 hasn't received the fanfare it deserves has to do with religious hatred of Apple and the iPhone by Android enthusiasts. They can be quite irrational. Anything that even hints of iOS is likely to be shunned no matter how good the device is. I got the 64GB blue one and have been smiling since. And get a Spigen case for it if you get one. The Spigen really enhances the beauty of the Honor 8 while protecting it. m477 I like iOS. I really don't like cheap copies of it, and some of the common chinese-OEM software solutions, like a pre-installed, intrusive cleaner. I hate bullshit like that. Marty I wouldn't call EMUI on the Honor 8 a cheap copy of iOS. But it sounds like you have a gripe against the Honor 8. m477 I'm just calling EMUI what it is. It's clearly meant to mimic iOS, and it has some very questionable design choices. I have nothing against Huawei's hardware, I own a P9 lite. Marty Yeah, well I don't see a problem with it. It isn't iOS. It definitely runs quick. Smoothest, fastest Android yet. m477 My problem it's that I find it ugly to look at, compared to other interface, and I really don't like that it tries so hard to mimic iOS. To each their own. Marty Like how Samsung tries so hard to copy the iPhone. But, that's how it goes... Marty You know something? I used to listen to people like you about the Honor 8 before I finally decided to do an impulse buy and get one. Things that people like you say kept me from taking a chance on it. I'm glad I did an impulse buy because it turns out to be one of the best phones I've ever owned. It isn't nearly like what people like you say about it. I've already said that Android enthusiasts raise objection to the Honor 8 for whatever reasons, but the general public will love this device because it is that good. All people have to do is disregard the "Android enthusiast" rhetoric about it and give it a go. D13H4RD2L1V3 EMUI 5 is pretty good. Tried it on a Mate 9 along with its Pro variant and it does zip past screens without effort. Sure, its aesthetics are questionable but it is much improved. m477 Good for you. I'm not an Android enthusiast as much as a tech enthusiast. My daily driver is an iPhone, and I've tried most of the various Android UIs (even ColorOS and MIUI). In my opinion EMUI design wise is one of the most derivative. I don't like the fact that is a copy mostly because it seems to be screaming "I want to be an iPhone but I'm not". It got much better with the fifth version, and it will not get in your way (most of the time, at least). It's obviously still Android under the hood. Most Huawei phones are overall good, but you can't deny that software design is not their forte. A normal user will be fine with that. I personally just don't like copycats. Marty Comparing EMUI to Touchwiz, I'd say Huawei is an expert on software. Meaning EMUI is way better than Samsung's junky software. My Honor 8...the software experience...feels refined and high quality compared to many other Android systems. If anyone wants the truth about it, just give an Honor 8 a try. Update it to EMUI 5/Android 7 and use it daily. It's impressive. This is coming from someone who has a great many phones and has experienced many more. I can list all the phones I've owned and have used and this Honor 8 is the finest of them. m477 The hate on Touchwiz/GraceUX is a little more than a meme right now. Design wise it's not that bad, actually. Every modern, highly specced phone is a good phone (with a few exceptions), and will be "impressive" in daily usage. It's mostly a matter of preference. Marty Heh...so if someone who has a significant number of modern devices sees one of them stand out as impressive, it means nothing? Like you say, "to each, their own". Michaels_28 EMUI = Spyware. I tossed out my Honor 8. It was a good phone for the price I paid ($350 with a promo) but if I had to do it again I would avoid it. Having said that, the reason why Huawei is not selling their affordable phones like hotcakes in the U.S. is not because of irrational hatred. It's because of 1) national security interest, and 2) patents. If you remember the length Apple went after Samsung because of "rectangles with rounded corners," then you should be able to picture the legal barrier Huawei (or anyone really) is facing. Marty If the government was concerned about national security, Obama would never have been president. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I like MIUI. It's very iPhoneish. m477 If you can stand EMUI, which is a cheap copy of the iPhone's interface, and some of the crappy software solutions, it's a good phone. Cakefish Galaxy S7 w/Exynos 8890 https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/d012918ef89a330af9de9ee732fbd0c60a69cebc2441f666b62a620328a3c72c.png MJ "...already-slightly-shaky performance." LOL Someday Samsung, someday. I really like look of the phone but the fingerprint scanner location (and shape) is really tragic and a no go. Toss3 Pretty sure that's just the 835 slowing things down, as the exynos version I tried was buttery smooth (smoother than my tweaked exynos S7). There are always going to be some slowdowns, but in the case of the S-series most of it can be linked back to the Snapdragon SoCs. David Ruddock Plenty of OEMs make Snapdragon chips run perfectly smooth. It says far more about Samsung than it does Qualcomm. Toss3 Didn't mean to make it sound like there is anything wrong with Snapdragon SoCs; they just aren't a priority over at Samsung and if you want a smooth experience, you need to get the international version. Samsung is definitely to blame, but they do offer an alternative and it's always better to let people know that the Exynos version is the one to get. MJ The international version is not really an option in the US for most people. Warranty, Samsung Pay (that fixed yet?), and some type of payment plan are all big things. ericshmerick No wifi calling, no gogo pass functionality (on T-Mo). whispy_snippet "if you want a smooth experience, you need to get the international version" ...you need to get a different phone all together. MJ What? No... tu3218 Just use google smart Lock. I rarely need to use my fingerprint scanner on my S7 edge because of this. MJ I rarely use my phone at home and don't have a smartwatch so Smart Lock is of limited use to me. The fingerprint scanner is the best option for me and I am not buying the S8 so it doesn't really matter. tu3218 On body detection...this doesn't just apply to the s8. It's any phone. Just in case you were unaware of that feature. I know I always forget about that one. S8 does the best of everything besides the fingerprint scanner. Very easy to look over. m477 Is not easy to look over. Even budget phones have nailed the fingerprint reader. It's unacceptable that it sucks on a flagship. tu3218 I agree. Last minute terrible decision. It helps knowing that. Doesn't make it right though. TBD how bad it is when I get my s8. Smart Lock helps though. Rick Atherton it might just be me but every phone I've used the on body detection the phone always does stuff in my pocket so i always turn it off Drakenoid I use Gravity Screen instead of that, works far better. Scott It sucks they couldn't figure out how to put in under the display as they clearly wished they could. I just hope Apple has the same issue, or Samsung will have some serious egg on their face come iPhone time. MJ While the under the display fingerprint scanner would be cool tech I am not sure about having a permanent fingerprint smudge on my screen. LOL whispy_snippet A fingerprint sensor under the display makes perfect sense. I can't wait until every phone can do it well. MJ A fingerprint sensor under the display would be cool but NOT any more practical (I would argue LESS practical) than a sensor on the back (and less costly to implement). whispy_snippet Having owned a Pixel since launch I'd have to say I disagree. I love my phone. I think the Pixel is such a well rounded experience. But the one area I really think could be better is the fingerprint sensor placement. Sure, it's great when it's in my hand. But it's almost always on a desk in front of me - just like right now. If I want to quickly check something, I need to pick it up to use the fingerprint sensor or leave it on the table and swipe in my pattern. Sucky. If the fingerprint sensor was on the front this issue would be eliminated immediately. I feel like putting fingerprint sensors on the back is just a way of being different to Apple for different's sake - and I guess I can sorta understand this given Apple kicks up such a huge song and dance the moment anyone tries to do anything coming close to their approach. But fuck it. Just put it on the front and fight them I say. MJ A Pixel XL owner since launch myself. The fingerprint sensor is quick and accurate and my finger slides into place naturally. What is there not to like? I never could understand "the phone on the desk argument". Incoming text and call information shows right up on the lock screen. I can just double tab and put in my pin if really need to do interact but I would pick it up and use the fingerprint scanner just like any other time I use my phone. I mostly use my phone when on the go anyway which means it is in my pocket and a rear sensor works much better (and natural) than the front sensor on my former HTC 10 ever did. "I feel like putting fingerprint sensors on the back is just a way of being different to Apple for different's sake...". Huh? No... Again, I would argue a sensor on back just makes more sense and in the case of Google they have always used on-screen buttons so a single fingerprint reader on the front would just look stupid (aka see Moto) and also the Nexus 6P/5X had front facing speakers so the sensor had to go on the back. whispy_snippet The thing is, double tap to wake doesn't work reliably. It works maybe 75% of the time. Not bad, but when it lets you down it grates. In fact the same goes for Google's screen off voice unlock - it works maybe 60% of the time and this REALLY annoys me... but I digress. The fingerprint scanner on the back is great when it's in your hand but annoying when it's on a desk. A fingerprint scanner on the front is good in your hand and good on a desk. Ultimately, I think I'd prefer a consistently good user experience. I think a fingerprint sensor behind the display will be the end goal for every phone maker. In a couple of years I reckon everyone will be doing it. Bryan Breguet Fingerprint sensor on the back makes no sense to me and is an automatic dealbreaker. I truly hate it. Also, really, you don't understand the argument of when the phone is on your desk? Surely you are trolling. MJ I think people who think they can't use their phone because it's sitting on a desk and it has rear fingerprint scanner are trolling. Alejandro You can double tap the screen to read the notifications...No need to unlock the phone with the fingerprint sensor. Bryan Breguet You can double tap to read the notification, not the full email or even picture or whatever. Are you guys really that thick that you are trying to use this argument? You'll ultimately need to unlock the phone and therefore it means you won't use the fingerprint almost half the time. Scott You mean on your touchscreen? MJ Yes. whispy_snippet On the one hand, yes. I expect Apple will get the fingerprint scanner under the display right for their upcoming flagship. On the other hand if Apple comes out with a minimal bezel, curved edge display it's going to be a special moment for Samsung. Finally, Samsung will be able to say outright "You copied US, Apple" and they'll be right. m477 You hope that a competing product has some issue and the advanced technology that everyone want's will not be ready, so Samsung's sells won't be hindered? Do you own Samsung stocks or something? Scott Hell yeah I want the iPhone to faceplant. enoch861 I've switched my S7 Edge between UHD and HD and I've never really noticed a battery life difference between the two. My battery has been overall atrocious for some reason, but I can't find the perpetrator. Overall I'm not sure if I'll be upgrading even though the S8+ looks quite attractive. illregal Samsung cheap garbage mainstream phones for the followers TechGuy22 LOL illregal funny because it's true. 2kool4skool ...that will sell millions. illregal yeah, there are walmarts all over the place as well. Quantity sold is not a factor of quality. 2kool4skool Then what is the factor of quality in this case? Amount of raging fanboys in tech forums? Flagships cost a lot these days. The fact that tens of millions of people trust their hard earned money with Samsung devices might say something about its quality. illregal It actually says something about their inability to think for themselves. Their inability to know what the difference between devices is in the first place. Most people call android devices droids. or think samsung is the only company that even makes android devices. You're giving people to much credit. They are much more dumb than you assume. Plus they saw 4 commercials for samsung crap during their episode of dancing with the stars, so it has to be good right!?? 2kool4skool And how do you think Samsung able to get all over the place in the first place? Samsung mobile division also start with with a humble beginning like every other android oem company. Htc arguably was a bigger player in early android days. But Samsung has consistently able to give what people want until today, that's why it keeps growing and expanding and now you can see 4 commercial about it during episodes of dancing with the stars. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ It's called capitalism. And it works most of the time. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yes quantity is an indicator of quality. McDonald's doesn't make the best quality food, but they sell the most because it's the best and most consistent quality fast food. I say that as someone who would never eat there, too. You don't compare McDonald's to Ruth's Chris, because they're not in the same category. The S8 and S8+ will sell gazillions because they're the best quality flagship phones. illregal You just contradicted yourself. They will sell gazillions because they are all over the place, and people are bombarded with ads, and don't know any better. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Debating with you is a waste of time, but McDonald's is all over the place because people like the food. If nobody liked it, they couldn't open so many locations. Consumers love Samsung phones. Deal. illregal I know what people love.. Problem is I have to support their poor choices. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Well, I don't have to support your idiotic comments. You're blocked now. Suicide_Note Cheap? Nope. Garbage? Nope. Mainstream? Yes, but that's what happens when you sell tens of millions of devices. XDAMM Excuse me while I enjoy my gorgeously designed phone with the best display and top tier cameras, performance and battery life. Samsung's S series are indeed mainstream but they're not cheap and they are definitely not garbage. Their software could always improve and they could release major Android versions faster but their hardware game is just too strong and at least their software is usually stable and reliable (unlike previous Nexus phones and the Pixel which continue to be plagued by Bluetooth issues even months after release). I'd love having a consistent 60fps UI like the Pixel does but I won't sacrifice other software additions and considerably better hardware just for smoothness. illregal sweet pink display yo. sweet top tier, meaning not as good as some cameras yo. Performance, yo.. Enjoy your stutters. and average battery life. Cat Astrophy Enjoy your pocket explosive XDAMM Really? That was funny and relevant when the Note 7 was confirmed of having that issue but not anymore. If you think about it every battery powered device is a potential hazard but we don't usually worry about our Bluetooth headphones or laptops exploding even though that happens often. A few S8 will likely combust because statistically speaking it's nearly impossible to make a perfect phone, but its quite unlikely for that to become a widespread issue again. Jumanji! Be honest - do you work for Saygus? Middlefinger Compared to who? Google? Its phones are total junk, riddled with hardware and software faults, and over priced. TechGuy22 i'm buying S8+ used probably the exynos version so i can put AOSP on it Bewear That would have been considered a crazy idea some years ago. Time sure changes everything! 2kool4skool Always go with exynos version. Smother and more battery life. The only drawback is a bit weaker gpu than SD version, but meh, we're not going to play crysis on it anyway. TechGuy22 yeah i can't be with a locked down phone. Tech Writer The GPU is more powerful on exynos this time around. Toss3 "I would seriously worry about breaking this phone if I bought it. There is so much glass - Samsung phones essentially require cases." - Not sure I agree as the glass is pretty tough if the S7/S7 Edge are anything to go by. Only thing I didn't like about the S8 is the curvature on the front glass, as it is just too much and makes the display look distorted. Middlefinger I agree, plus the glass can be changed, whereas a metal unibody cant (as easily) and dents/ scratches much more easily. Ammar I just cannot decide between this and the Pixel XL. S8 is just a sultry, almost exotic looking device. But despite what the reviews will say, I doubt the performance and battery will be as consistent. jonathan If you want consistent performance and timely updates go for the pixel or wait for the next pixel, if you want a sexy device go with the S8. Me myself I always prefer the device with consitant performance and timely updates XDAMM I care more about a fast and responsive UI, fast app opening and switching and good gaming performance than 60FPS UI. Because of this, the better display, cameras, ingress protection rating, iris scanner, wireless charging and 64GB of (faster) storage by default there is just no comparison and I'll get the S8. The Pixel is an interesting proposition but it's not sold officially in my country and they have so many Bluetooth and battery related issues they're just not worth the asking price and trouble IMO. Rod http://i.imgur.com/kHx9ayV.gif http://i.imgur.com/qa22ZNQ.gif P. Sherman Bluetooth on Pixels are damn near UNUSABLE since launch. The fingerprint reader was rendered UNUSABLE in 7.1.2. Lags here and there are infinitely more acceptable than hardware failures, which apparently the Pixel is very good at. Rod I don't think inconsistent performance is acceptable on a > 720 bucks device. P. Sherman But it's still better than NON-PERFORMANCE. 2kool4skool The only thing I don't like from this otherwise great devices is the extra "Bixby" button. It kinda mess up the seamlessness of the device a little bit. But I don't think it's would be a significant upgrade from s7 edge, but I really like where Samsung is heading with these new devices, though. I'll wait for the next iteration, if the rumors are true, next galaxy s would probably feature an under-screen fingerprint scanner. It would make the device evn more seamless, they could get rid the home button entirely. One could only hope. Ome Dries Are the screenshots on the S8 square? That means it renders pixels the display can't even show, imagine how much performance & battery life they could've gained 2kool4skool Considering it renders 4262400 pixels by default, I don't think few pixels on the corners would make that much of a difference. create812 Stock Android or bust. Also, what's the deal with Project Fi? Can any phone with the proper radios take advantage of a Project Fi SIM, or does Goog only allow "approved" phones? Marty Only Nexii and the Pixels. create812 I think I saw a video early in the Project Fi days of a Samsung phone having a Fi SIM in it, and it partially worked (only worked with one of the carriers). I'm wondering what the current status of this is. Can someone pop a Fi SIM into their S8 and figure out what happens? Max Apparently we can also include now Nokia phones. raazman Can't wait to see what they're gonna do. OligarchyAmbulance Nokias are supposed to work on Fi? Max Not at the moment, but the rumor mill is that they want to be "the next Nexus" so depending on their relationship with Google that could be the case in the future. Just a guess based on rumors so take it with a grain of salt. FeelThePoveR Or OnePlus. (Or custom roms in my case) Roy No. OnePlus tow don't got any nougat Defenestratus What is stock android these days? I don't even know. EvilHowl AOSP Eric Abreu You can use a Project Fi sim card with other phones, but you'll only have access to the T-Mobile network. I think that you'll also need to activate the sim card on a Nexus or Pixel device before moving it to a non-Google device 2kool4skool "Stock Android or bust." You're missing out so many great phones out there. raazman What's so great about them? Mike Limited bezels is a good start. Realistically, to keep this short it would be more what's so great about stock phones: 1. Fast Updates 2. Quicker UI 3. ........ That's about it. raazman Quicker UI? I beg to differ. Fast updates? Um what? Not even remotely close. Mike You need to read the entire comment to get what I'm saying. Unless you are, in fact, saying that Samsung's phones will get quicker updates than Pixel phones. raazman Oh, oops. I replied to 2kool4skool. I already know Google's Nexus Pixels are better in both regards. Mike And that's also where it ends in terms of what does stock offer over other Android phones. raazman Opinions I guess, because I differ on that stance. Mike Other than the two things I named, name something stock Android does better than a phone Samsung/LG released. FeelThePoveR Customizability which is the main point of android I guess. Middlefinger Whos updates? Googles or Samsungs? Recent events should tell you that rushing to install whatever Google pushes out isnt always a good thing. 2kool4skool They don't have endless problems like pixel and pixel xl for a start. raazman Ummm...you sure buddy? LG? Samsung TouchWiz? Which phones are we talking about here? And my Pixel XL has not had a problem yet. So I'm not convinced. Mike Ah, the good old "My ____ is working fine so obviously there's no issues at all". Hearing this always makes me appreciate what we've become. raazman I just commented saying I've seen this trend since the S3 among friends and family, calm down. Mike "And my Pixel XL has not had a problem yet. So I'm not convinced." Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Nobody who owns a Pixel XL has a problem with it. Except those who do. 2kool4skool I don't know man, I tend to believe tech sites like this more than the trend among your friends and family. And this site talks a lot about pixel problems. The last one was 2 days ago about some pixels losing fingerprint scanner functionality after latest update, look it up. raazman How about note 7 explosions? TouchWiz lag? And now it seems like the S8 screen has color issues. 2kool4skool Here we go again with "my phone might have a lot of problems, but at least it doesn't explode" argument. Note 7 is dead, and people get their money back, so it literally cost people 0$. How much pixel cost? 800$? Stop comparing 0$ phone to 800$ one. raazman Haha you're delusional if you think the galaxies don't have issues. 2kool4skool I never think or said that. All phones have issues including galaxies. But it's the first time I see devices (pixel and pixel xl) with so much problems that continously popped up and being featured on Android sites for almost every two weeks. Roy Because everybody want to hear about Pixel so even it's a little bunch of users let's make a headlight. Rod Actually, many people lost $ due to cases and other accessories not being refunded. Middlefinger Never seem this mythical lag, the Note was bad, but a one off, this screen colour seems like a first batch issue like all devices have. The Pixel is just riddled with faults even the newest batch. Remember the N5 was redesigned because the first run was so poor, the N7 had terrible screen quality problems and slow NAND, HTCs have had multiple camera issues, the iPhone also had screen issues, Sony had battery issues. Its common. Rod How about this one? http://i.imgur.com/kHx9ayV.gif Middlefinger Right, first release software (or even pre-release). Ive seen just as bad on a Nexus at release, if not worse. My Samsungs have never exhibited anything like that. Rod I've had 3 Nexus, and never saw anything like that either. Middlefinger Ive had 5, all had some lag, I returned 2 because they were poor quality. Roy Not really he was talking also about 6p and shocking it's smooth as ever. Most of the users don't have this problems. Middlefinger Samsung sell hundreds of millions of phones, Google has sold about 12 Pixels.. OK an exaggeration, but the point remains. If you sell more, a LOT LOT more, then problems seem more common, but as a percentage they arent. 2kool4skool And out of 12 pixels sold, 9 have problems. 9/12, needs more bugs. - IGN Rashad Actually, 9/12=.75 7.5 = Good -IGN Roy Not really. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Correction: HTC has shipped about 2 million Pixels and Pixel XLs since launch 6 months ago. Samsung has 20 million S8/S8+ phones ready for launch. Middlefinger and will sell more than 2 million in the first day. Nexus/pixel sales have always been poor, just like the product. Roy My 6p also no problem. illregal Samsungs have more hardware and software issues than everyone else combined. raazman Since the S3, yes this is what I've personally seen among friends and family. 2kool4skool Lol, who are we kidding here? You can find bunch of articles about pixel problems on this site. Last article I read was 2 days ago about some pixels lost ability to set up fingerprint scanner after latest update. Roy Haha but it isn't true my 6p rocking with a great fingerprint scanner. Middlefinger I think the Pixel has that crown now. I have had zero problems with any of my Samsungs, ive returned all my Nexus devices due to faults and poor quality. create812 I know, but stock Android, fast updates, and compatibility with Fi are my top priorities. Roy Not really. Not looking for junk. Defenestratus Picking up my S8+ on Friday - despite Bixby stupidity. I'm praying that the community figures out how to disable it. I currently have a Nexus 6P that constantly infuriates me. The pixel was not a value proposition that I was convinced was worth it - and I doubt the Pixel 2 will be either if they stick with the old, tired form factors and tiny screen sizes. So S8+ is what I'm left with. We'll see if it leads to user angst or not. I'm trying my best to be optimistic. Jay If it can be disabled by a package disabler, I'll be happy. I think. catalysto Early rumors say Pixel 2 will have a much smaller bezel like the other phones coming out this generation. I wouldn't make any assumptions yet. 2kool4skool If Google wanted smaller bezel for their pixel 2, they gonna need to pick some company other than Htc to do their devices. Htc simply can't manufacture a phone with small bezel or water resistant because their manufacturing process is outdated. catalysto Who says Google won't do that? 2kool4skool I never said, that. In fact, I think It would be cool if they go with Motorola this year. illregal their manufacturing process isn't outdated. They just care. They mill out unibody designs from a solid block. Which takes time and effort. Unlike samsung, who just stamps out garbage, quantity quantity quantity. 2kool4skool Have you seen their latest device, htc u? It's enormous in size, but only has 3000mah battery. It's thick af, yet it still has a very protuding camera. It doesn't even have audio jack, water resistance, and wireless charging yet yet it still cost an arm and leg. If that's what you mean by care, I can't imagine how much shittier their device would be if they made if without care. Jay There might be a few more compromises here than I originally thought but it's too late to cancel my pre-order. Now I don't know whether I should even bother. 😕 Thanks for this uncertainty now, David. (Partially kidding..) 4Ui812 I see the red tint in most pics. AC has a story about that problem with some phones in Korea . Is the bootloader locked down like with the S7E ? http://www.androidauthority.com/galaxy-s8-displays-red-discoloration-764692/ https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2550b567c5a3bd243534cc66e251d0edbb770bd373e83a7961b5012e2e49c482.jpg Marty Holy shit! The HTC S8. 2kool4skool Probably just some devices with miscalibrated screen, for now can be solved by lowering red pixel intensity in setting. But they'll probably fix it via OTA later. Samsung introduced new screen calibration setting on nougat, you can set the intensity of each of RGB pixels to meet your desired color balance. Here's setting screenshot on my s7 edge. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/78c23a79995e1f76d6daf742ac05cc0f8893b2871459eeb4cdfec41c6eef2872.png illregal You can't fix poor screen quality with an OTA. If you lower a setting to calibrate a device via an update. The ones without the issue will then be more off. It's not a matter of adjustments, its a matter of poor qc and not yielding consistent products. 2kool4skool How it's "poor screen quality"? It's not hardware problem. Just some minor adjustments via OTA, and it will be fixed. If you're asking how they're gonna fix it without ruining other devices, the answer is the same way Google fixes pixels with Bluetooth problem without ruining the ones that's function just fine. It's software problem, they're gonna figure something out. FeelThePoveR It may as well be a hardware problem, because why couldn't it be? 2kool4skool I highly doubt that, because as I said before the problem can simply be solved by lowering red pixel intensity in setting. Galaxy s screens has always feature calibration setting as a feature, probably it's just some sloppy written code messing up with the setting. And if that's the case, it would be fixable via OTA. Take my answer with a grain of salt, though. Because we still need confirmation from Samsung if that's indeed the case. This is merely the logical answer I can think of for this problem. catalysto Is calibration the problem? Because software cannot calibrate a screen without being able to see it. So no, an OTA would not be able to fix that. The screen must be calibrated at the factory. 2kool4skool Software doesn't necessarily needs to see the screen in this case. Samsung can get their hands on the affected device, tweak it and figure which screen batch affected, and send tweaked software to all devices via OTA. Your comment does make sense, though. Unless Samsung can figure out which devices affected and need for fix, users probably will have to resort to the last option, go to setting and tweak it themselves manually. illregal what I'm saying is.. You can't push out an ota to adjust the screen calibration. Because how is that OTA gonna pick n choose which ones need the adjustment and which ones don't. It's a hardware issue. Samsung makes garbage. 2kool4skool They don't necessarily have to send out an OTA that needs to pick which ones need adjustment and which ones don't. They can just send an OTA that works for both as intended. But whatever, you can believe what you want to. I merely stated what I think a logical answer for this problem. Middlefinger You can if its due to a setting. HTC managed to get rid of a huge red blob in the middle of the HD2 camera with an update. Plenty, like you, assumed it was a hardware fault. Rod It's not. https://i.imgur.com/oYe2HPZ.jpg Rod The problem is, if those devices already have those values maxed out. 2kool4skool Actually, rather than fixed values, these RGB settings act more like percentage values. Meaning you can set them lower and it wouldn't make a difference unless one value is bigger than another. It's hard to describe but I'll include another screenshot. The result would be the same even if you lower those values as long as it's on the same level. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2788b47dbae19707db41c131c25f545abf51fe7ac923621517261397b1c4390b.png same as https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/78c23a79995e1f76d6daf742ac05cc0f8893b2871459eeb4cdfec41c6eef2872.png Rod Yeah, I know. That value was arbitrary. Though now I'd like to know from Ruddock himself what were the default values in his review unit. 2kool4skool Yeah, and apparently some screens might interpret those values differently / inaccurately, hence the problem. And if that's correct, an OTA fix should be logically possible. That's all what I was saying. Rod I hope so. But all OLED panels I've seen to this date, has screen tint of some color. Either red or green. 2kool4skool Can't deny that. Some OLED panels, especially the lower end ones are struggling to produce a balanced color, it's usually most noticeable while viewing white color. That's why IPS screens usually produce better whites than oleds. But oleds produce deeper black than IPS. In the end, each have strength and weaknesses. Get what you prefer. Rod Yeah. I, for one, prefer pure white. Can't stand the reddish whites on the S8 reviewed here. C Lo Who doesn't enjoy buying a $900 device and then having to fix it yourself. Sounds like a swell situation to me. /s 2kool4skool Nobody said that. It sucks that this problem happens. We're just discussing possible fix for it, not trying to disregard the problem itself. Rod Oh boy..... https://i.imgur.com/oYe2HPZ.jpg 2kool4skool You really don't get it, do you? That's why I said it's miscalibrated. Although both of those devices have the same RGB values, the affected device read and interpret those values incorrectly. On affected device, you need to lower the Red value to something like this in order to make the red tint disappear. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/5ae0be301ee03f23d53f275a783d6c59be4e7147070152bed2c42ae2ce2551fe.png These articles might explain it better that I do.

Tests have demonstrated that using lower then native resolutions has no appreciable benefit to the battery. What you gain is a more stable FPS count. dabug91 Exactly, there may be a slight difference if you're constantly playing games, but regardless of whether you're in 1080p or 1440p mode, every single one of those pixels on the screen is still turned on and using the same amount of power other than pure black. makapav You will only recover energy saved on CPU and GPU cycles that would otherwise have been used for rendering those extra pixels. Morten Ulv Wont those just be used at giving you higher FPS? Either way, I guess the point was that the difference is negligible. Abhishek Saral So like if I run a 4K XPS 15 on 1080P resolution. Will I see a battery improvement? Tech Writer Not much at all. On the other hand, if you get the 1080p XPS 15, it will last much longer. Most of the higher power consumption of higher res screens comes from the panel itself. Changing render resolution doesn't change this, unless you do native res 3D rendering or play games. David Ruddock Alright, that may well be. I'll adjust to "performance." D13H4RD2L1V3 Probably the only savings you'd get is from the processor not needing to drive a lot more pixels. It's usually quite minimal at best, imperceptibly so at worst. Rod 1080p vs 1440p when drawing 2D is a non-issue, actually. godutch It's less calculations though, gpu is less used and can clock lower m477 The impact of the GPU on the battery is very, very small, unless graphically intensive games are in use. End even then, the difference between 1440p and 1080p is not that big. DanSan I pre-ordered the GS8+. Coming from the Nexus 6, this seemed to be my best option even after playing with both phones extensively the day after they were announced. I'm going to miss my Nexus experience but honestly I'm tired of being a beta tester for Googles software. Past couple of months my N6 has been almost useless at times, freezing doing basic tasks. I don't care about locked bootloaders or rooting anymore, I just want to be able to tweak a few things to my liking and have a phone that just.... works. Max If you're picky then there's a very high chance that you will regret moving to a Samsung phone if you are looking for "a phone that just... works". Samsung software has many annoyances for people accustomed to the Google Android experience. demarcmj This. Every time I try to help a family member with their galaxy device I get really frustrated trying to figure out how the damn thing works. DanSan I assume thats because you're going from stock android to Samsung experience, I can understand the confusion Zsolt V And hundreds of millions of people have no such problems. Interesting. DanSan Totally agree with you but doing simple things now are a pain for me. I just want to unlock it and take a picture or text somebody. easy and simple. catalysto Not sure what the problem is on yours. Mine can open the camera instantly with a power button double-press. DanSan That may be true, time will tell. I have an iPhone 6S as a work device, I end up using that because my Nexus 6 has become so bad. Even after a factory wipe. I will take any kind of change Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ We have two iPhone 6S phones in our family. They both "just work" unless there's an iOS update waiting. After updating, they both "just work" again. I have to wonder if some of the apps update before the OS does, and that's why the problems occur when the update hasn't yet been applied. Just a guess. Suhas I switched to S6 Edge+ eighteen months ago from a N5 after being a loyal Nexus user since the Galaxy Nexus. Surprisingly, it was the best decision ever. Back in the day I used to root, flash custom ROMs and tinker with the phone a lot which I ain't bothered to do so anymore. Also the Nexus kept failing on me in certain areas (Bluetooth, memory leaks, sub-par speakers, camera, battery etc.) and I got fed up. The S6 Edge+ was worth the price and it has been an amazing phone. Can't wait to get my hands on the S8! Switch and you will not regret. DanSan I'm pumped but definitely going to be a learning curve when it comes to samsung settings and what not. But i think we were in the same boat, just tired of tweaking and tinkering to get it to do what i want. Even now I have to make excuses for how bad my phone is, granted its a few years old but I'm over it. Gjorgi Lazarovski well you made the wrong choice going with a Samsung device, since "nothing" works on them. You always get the weirdest bug reports from Samsung users. They have issues with a bunch of apps. 2kool4skool Lol if you're talking about bugs, look no further than pixel and pixel xl. You can find bunch of articles about problems with these devices on this site. You have problems ranging from Bluetooth issue, camera halo / lens flare, dodgy connection, fingerprint issue, etc etc, I lost track. Do your research. Gjorgi Lazarovski I was talking about apps compatibility, but yeah Rod Correct. https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/3xgxg2/why_is_there_so_much_hate_against_samsung/ Rod Welcome aboard. http://i.imgur.com/qa22ZNQ.gif Roy My 6p doing the best job until today and still rocking, very smooth and very consist software. Just love it. Heiro78 i never planned on using the fingerprint sensor so thats not an issue. I would only use this along with the other biometric security features if I could have all of them turned on and required to unlock the device. im wondering if the double press home to open the camera is still functional. im guessing not. EvilHowl Yes, it works Heiro78 Cool thanks, i assume you're talking about the double press on the home for the camera shortcut. EvilHowl Yep Chippah Peckas Fresh360 So. Many. WORDS! I LOVE IT! zooster Gemme an on screen fingerprint scanner, a 18:9 screen (not 18,5:9, too long), shave off upper and bottom bezel by some millimeter more, add stereo speakers, dual camera, quick charge 4 and a battery somewhat larger... Then I'll but it ☺️ plexabyte What is this, the Turing Cadenza? Jaime does anybody know if the galaxy s8 has the At&t logo on the back? can't find any image of it (which is great!), but I don't want to be disappointed when my phone arrives with an ugly logo on it's back. wests It does not. The Rebrand Nation From laggy touchwiz 5 of the galaxy s5 to near perfect smasung experience 8.1 Not bad for 4 years FeelThePoveR Considering that OnePlus rose from nothing to the company they are today in 4 years and the fact that Samsung is supposed to be the top player with highest development budget of all, it's pretty bad. Bob Marley They didn't rise from nothing. They have the funding and resources of Oppo, a major smartphone player, behind their back. FeelThePoveR They had to build their "brand" from nothing and their success is impressive, becouse at least where I live people prefer to buy things from known brands even if it's not the best bang for buck, as they don't trust the newcomers. Middlefinger But Oneplus phones still have boatloads of issues and very dubious quality, both hardware and software. FeelThePoveR Boatloads of issues? I wouldn't say so, every device has it's quirks but OnePlus is really good at listening to the community and fixing them. Dubious quality? 1+3 and 1+3T are the fastest Snapdragon 820 and 821 devices ever for half of the price of other comperable devices so what about that is so dubious? Maybe camera is not a top notch one but it's good anyway, certainly good enough for the price. Middlefinger Build quality, and reliability is the problem. I'm a regional manager for a electronics service/retail company, we get a lot back, they just aren't made very well. FeelThePoveR Well I've seen a couple from the inside and they seemed really neatly designed/put together and besides even phones from the "old players" could cause more trouble then 1+ ones i.e. LG with its loose components on the motherboard causing bootlops, Samsung Note 7 burning battery or my oldy HTC M7 purple camera tint issue. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ From feature-free stock Android to Nougat with split screen. Not bad for 4 years. Middlefinger Really it was done in 1 year. The S5 wasnt good, but the S6 was in a different league. The S7 and S8 have just been refinements really. Rod Near perfect? http://i.imgur.com/qa22ZNQ.gif http://i.imgur.com/kHx9ayV.gif Nishant i guess this would be a great upgrade from my Galaxy S3!!! :) Cat Astrophy So what you're saying...is that this phone is THE BOMB? Typical Samsung. I like my phones non-explodey. My name is…. biased, as always. You call this phone pricey? Then what is Pixel? DanSan There is a difference between being pricey for the sake of being pricey (read: Pixel) and being pricey because you have the best spec available. lomsha Yep at least this looks and feels like an $850 phone. Gjorgi Lazarovski Why biased tho? They called out the Pixel for it's price too, wtf. Like, everyone did. David Ruddock I don't know, maybe read our review? "Price: There's no way around it, the price points are high. iPhone high. And you're going to be hard-pressed to convince the value-obsessed that there's nearly $800 of smartphone in a Pixel XL." http://www.androidpolice.com/2016/10/18/google-pixel-review-a-very-good-phone-by-google/ My name is…. Pixel is a dud, worst value for money ever. You should have been far more negative for Pixel than you were. Sweet talking it doesn't change things. Just because you mention that the price was high, doent meant that you shouldnt have angrily bashed it (if you were a subjective reviewer) And no, S8 doesn't ask a lot. Its a true flagship with the appropriate price. 1+3 owner here. 2kool4skool Shhh... Pixels have G logo on their back. That alone worth the $200. Seriously though, pixels are often get too many undeserved praises (just my opinion) in tech sites, probably because it's the "nerds and purists" devices, which make up most of tech sites target audience. It even got best phone of the year award if I'm not mistaken despite the fact it doesn't have a lot of features a $800 phones should have anf it's infested with bugs and problems even until this day. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ All Google phones get undeserved praise, especially on Android sites. The reason for that should be self-evident. It's self-preservation. Defenestratus It's just a dang shame that you aren't on the editorial payroll at AP. Just a dang shame I tell ya. Max Big comment fail... Both are pricey and both were called for it. Middlefinger Still hung up on updates i see. Is Googles 7.1.whatever really any better than 7.0 with Samsungs mods? Whats the difference? Whats the advantage? In reality, there isnt any. Samsung doesnt run stock android, and isnt bound by Googles mods, or Googles fixes. It can do its own, and that may mean having a slightly lower number in the settings, but it has no negative effect on the security or experience. Other OEMs are the same LG never used 4.4.3 or 4.4.4 on the G2 or 3, but had al the fixes and updates they needed, because the Google updates were device specific and not necessary. Benjamin Walburn It might not make a difference for bugs and security flaws, but certain APIs need the OS update. The image keyboard and app icon shortcuts are two examples. More importantly, there's just no reason to not use 7.1. It's been 4 months since official launch, and major OEMs get early access. Middlefinger Maybe Samsung arent happy with the quality? 7.1 and its variant have been rather.. buggy, of late. Lollipop was like that, its was the worst, and i know Samsung had a lot of custom code in their version. There is no reason though why Samsung cant implement its own version of APIs, or simply wait to avoid issues. Rod Just stop. Middlefinger Stop what? Do you even read this site, the evidence is right here. Rod Samsung doesn't keep their phones updated because they're too busy making unwanted, duplicate apps. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yeah, Google never makes unwanted duplicate apps. Rod Such as? tim242 You need to get a life, if all you have to do is bitch about duplicate apps. EVERY DAY. Rod My life is fine, thanks. Middlefinger No they make time to release to make sure the software works properly. They have to do that because Googles release often doesn't, just like all the problems seen on 7.1.2 lately. Unwanted apps you say?? Like most of the Google apps.. Rod You make it look better than it is. Samsung phones are the most buggy, according to the developers. Middlefinger Are they now, where is this 'developer' news i seem to have missed? Rod https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/3xgxg2/why_is_there_so_much_hate_against_samsung/ Middlefinger One temporary example that is not longer true. What about all of googles messy code and bugs, that kill phones? Benjamin Walburn Oh, they definitely could, but a duplicate API isn't the same as the original, especially in Android. App developers would have to add additional code for the Samsung API. Even mirroring the API entirely wouldn't work, as apps look at the system API level to decide how to run. Even if Samsung copied it perfectly, apps would still detect it as an older Android version and not use the features. I can't comment on the bugginess of the later release. I haven't had any problems with updates, but that would be a valid concern. Godspoken That hero image is freaking amazing. Is the picture on the screen photoshopped? I almost read AP reviews for the great photographs of phones as much as I do for the actual facts and opinions at this point. David Ruddock It's a real image. The screen is color corrected a bit (thanks to Jeff for that) to match the tone of the pavement. But I took the photo on the S8, zoomed in and lined it up, then took the picture with my RX10, yeah. Rod Of course it was edited, to remove the red tint. Lol Crafted Crows It is an impressive piece of hardware but after 1 day of use my fingers hurt :). I have the S7 and I find that size to be perfect. While the screen gorgeous, it's too tall for 1 hand use and the infamous hamburger menu is killing my fingers. Not comfortable at all. Margaritas Ante Porcos Great review. As always. Beautiful phone but we won't see the beauty because we'll have to hide this fragile cutie inside a case. Also Bixby is total crap. So sad to say this but as many other disappointed Galaxy fans I will skip on S8. Absolutely not worth buying. At least not for that money. Fr0gg0 Better luck next time, Samsung. Dallas King Fingerprint scanner on the power button, on the side would have been better. Eumelanin Knight Samsung sees to have an innovative then perfect cycle with their phone. I look forward to seeing what's up with the S9. Yup, I went there. That full screen fingerprint sensor, maybe? Rod There's a really noticeable red tint on that display tim242 Where is that in the review? Oh, it is not there. Rod There's an obvious red tint on the reviewed unit, unless you're daltonic. https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nexus2cee_DSC07210-1.jpg https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nexus2cee_DSC07227-1.jpg https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nexus2cee_DSC07218.jpg https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nexus2cee_DSC07222.jpg https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nexus2cee_DSC07220.jpg Plus, there's this: https://www.cnet.com/news/some-samsung-galaxy-s8-phones-ship-with-red-tinted-screens/ tim242 He did not mention it, so it could be lighting. The story you linked says only SOME UNITS AND CAN BE MANUALLY FIXED. Rod Well, let's ask @rdr0b11:disqus then BTW: never saw anyone take pictures in broad daylight whilst illuminating the subject with a red light. Maybe the sun shines differently where he lives. Roy You are right, the red tint is clearly noticeable from the pictures and it's bothering me a lot that no one (not even the reviewer) is talking about it. Rod As a LCD-phone owner, I'm deeply disturbed by screen tint. I like my whites milk-like. mlj11 I know Bixby's gonna be unpopular (around the enthusiast crowd at least) but I wish I had something like Bixby Vision. After Goggles' apparent abandonment by Google, I still haven't found a simple and good enough replacement for it. Using Assistant on my Pixel XL just plain doesn't work for stuff like item recognition or QR code reading. Rod Cannot unsee the lag. http://i.imgur.com/kHx9ayV.gif Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Flipboard has always been very laggy. It doesn't surprise me that its replacement is also laggy. Personally, it doesn't matter to me. I never use Flipboard anymore, I don't use Google Now, and I would be very unlikely to use Bixby. ericshmerick The defense has begun lol Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ No defense. Bixby's info thing is laggy. If that matters to you, don't buy the phone. Rod You can deal with low framerate... But I doubt you can deal with the phone freezing up! http://i.imgur.com/qa22ZNQ.gif Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Fake. He's not even touching the phone, except when he touches a grayed out option that doesn't do anything. That makes me think your Bixby lag gif is fake, too. Rod If you watched the video, you'll see that he mentions the software has problems, exactly when that part is displayed. whispy_snippet "Fake". Classic. m477 Yeah, Michael Fisher is payed by Samsung competitors to make the S8 look laggy, obviously. Iamsecond Your comment was brilliantly sarcastic, but 'payed?' Seriously? I'm sorry for picking on you, but this is the third time I've seen this misspelling this week and I'm starting to wonder if I'm going slightly mad! Surely 'paid' is a common enough word that everyone should know how to spell it? m477 Welp, I must have been drunk or something. I usually write in mostly correct English, I swear. Miles Reiter To add on to what others have already said, that's not a grayed out option, there's no scenario in Instagram where the search button will be grayed out and non-functional. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ So he just didn't touch it. It's very obvious he's not touching anything on the phone in that GIF. You could also take a screen shot of that Instagram page, and fake it that way. I'll believe these problems when I see them widely reported, not because some bozo posts a gif. JC Just go watch the video. Winston Thats a strange issue. I loaded the S8 home screen + Hello Bixby onto my S7. No lag. Rod It's called inconsistent performance. Which means it won't happen all the time. PoisonApple31 Which is why it is not a big deal Rod For someone shelling out 800 bucks for a phone, I think it's not ok. iPhones will be butter-smooth for the same price. Peter World Citizen Looks fake ... Rod What does? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ It is fake. Kevin Davis Great review, thanks. Beautiful phones, but they're going to be a pass for me. Vivek Rameses You can install the new launcher by updating the TouchWiz apk on apkmirror. Had it for a few weeks and it runs fine. Rocket Bixby Vision can identify objects. I showed it a Galaxy S7. It gave me results for iPads. Sounds like Apple will be picking up this idea for Siri pretty soon Marty LMAO...Even machines know Sammy copies Cakefish Interestingly, from the reviews that I have been reading, the Exynos 8890 beats the Snapdragon 835 in single-core Geekbench performance and loses narrowly in multi-core performance. So, overall, very similar levels of performance. Shows that Samsung was ahead of the curve last year, meaning that the Galaxy S7 should age well CPU-wise. Marty I think I can easily pass on the S8. I prefer a device not have a pink tinted display. The last time this happened was with the HTC 10. Too much competition, Samsung, for you to put out lackluster products. 4Ui812 David Ruddock 2 questions. Do you know if the bootloader is locked like on the S7E from T-MOBILE ? Why is this 8 hour old article pushed to the top of the list ? I think I know the answer to the second question. But do you have any info on the first ? Rod Because it's relevant? 4Ui812 Paid. Rod Yes, they get paid better when more people click on pages with ads. roverstim ewww, pink tint. D13H4RD2L1V3 I can definitely see the fingerprint sensor placement being an afterthought. Had Synaptics and Samsung got that display sensor working in time, the feature where you can wake the device from sleep by "pressing" the portion of the display that houses the home button would have a lot more worth. Oh well, hope it's ready in time for the Note 8, but with rumors that even Apple is having issues with it, we may have to wait for 2018. I don't find Bixby all that useful, and certainly not to the point where it needs its own button. It has its merits, but overall, I feel that it's one of those features where people use once or twice after unboxing and then forget that it existed, like Siri, or those who are deeply-vested in the Google ecosystem would probably just use Google Now. I find that rather sad, because some of its other add-ons, such as the ability to play other forms of audio through the device itself while it's casting another audio source via Bluetooth is one of those things that are immensely useful. I just wish that they're actually more prominently shown so that people know it exists. It's a nice phone overall, though. Makes me optimistic for the next Galaxy Note. tim242 THE CAMERA IS NOT THE SAME AS THE S7. 260 VS 333 Rod Who do those numbers represent? tim242 The S7 has the Sony 260. The S8 has the Sony 333. dblock I am a huge fan of rooting and ROMing my phones, but the truth is, being a crack flasher and flashing new ROMs all the time is really time consuming. So while it will take a while to get used to not being able to do this, and losing Viper4Android (hoping I can make Samsung's EQ work somewhat close to V4A) and some other customizations/tweaks, overall I think I will be more satisfied not worrying about trying to flash the "best" ROM all the damn time. I do hold out hope that basic root is achieved on the phone so I can get V4A going on this thing, but I won't hold out too long. 2kool4skool If you're so worried about sound, galaxies have Adapt Sound feature that you might want to try out. I'm also a former user of viper4android, but decided to ditch it last year because adapt sound is easier to set up. It also sounds fantastic on my hd 449. dblock I can't remember if Adapt Sound works with Bluetooth headphones or not, do you know if it does? That's why I loved V4A, could really fine tune all different output types; phone speakers, headset, Bluetooth and dock. 2kool4skool Well, that's a bummer. No, as far as I know it doesn't work with Bluetooth headphones. ROB You need to add something... DO NOT BUY the unlocked version Chips N Care to explain? ROB Google the S7 unlocked fiasco...they are still on 6.0.1...all other S7 have been updated to 7.0 and they have abandoned the ones bought directly from Samsung... Cakefish Galaxy S7 Geekbench scores. The Exynos 8890 processor was ahead of its time, it'll remain very competitive throughout 2017. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/ccc4e4d7770fbc4f43c68d526b56060883fe49a88537a5e39d175e8207d6c05e.png Rod If even the Snapdragon 800 holds well to this day.. blairh Fingerprint placement is complete garbage. Still no stereo speakers. S8 is too tall. More impressed with the S8 Plus. TeeJay1100 Size is personal preference. I'll say this, after playing with them in Best buy, the S8 feels just right. The S8+ is a tad taller. blairh The S8 is too tall IMO. tim242 The S8+ is even taller... blairh I just think the S8 is way too tall when compared to the iPhone 7. Apple will be releasing a 5.8" screen phone this fall with roughly the same footprint of the iPhone 7. That to me makes a lot more sense then going so tall as the S8 for the same size screen. tim242 You have no idea what dimensions the next iphones will be. blairh You're right. But I also believe the strong rumors of a 5.8" screen with a footprint the size of the current iPhone 7. tim242 There were those same strong rumors about the S8. The current iphone 7 would not fit a 16:9 5.8" display... blairh I believe this is what we will see this fall. http://www.iclarified.com/60037/diagram-allegedly-reveals-design-of-58inch-iphone-with-4mm-bezels-images tim242 Yeah, no. Apple has had gigantic bezels for 10 years. They aren't going to be suddenly nothing. Rod Isn't the S8 even taller? Lol blairh I'm assuming you mean the S8 Plus. Yes, it is, but it also has a larger screen. I just think the S8 is way too tall when compared to the iPhone 7. Apple will be releasing a 5.8" screen phone this fall with roughly the same footprint of the iPhone 7. That to me makes a lot more sense then going so tall as the S8 for the same size screen. Rod But the S8+ is proportionally taller than the S8 lol. blairh I understand that. But I can swallow that size phone when the screen is that large. I think the next iPhone will give you the same size screen in a smaller package. Semianonymous Kinda reminds me of the s6 in a lot of ways. Sacrifices made to acheive a new design. At least they didn't kill the waterproofing and SD slot this time around. lomsha I'm quite tempted. Paul Quinn We knew about the poor fingerprint sensor placement for quite some time. I thought that's probably something that could prove to be less of an issue over time (muscle memory). But now it's sounding like it doesn't even work well. That is enough to kill it for me. I am spoiled by instantaneous unlock on the Mate 9. I don't understand how a brand new phone from THE premier Android manufacturer isn't at least getting close to that. Rod Rushed changed. It was supposed to be underneath the screen. Zahir_SMASH I just want to know what round icon pack that is. Cakefish Pretty sure it's the same one as I use: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.themezilla.pixelui Rod Looks neat for a free app. Zahir_SMASH Thanks! Roy Am I the only one noticing the red-tinted screen issue with the photos of the reviewed device? tim242 Some units have that, mostly the units sent out early. It can be adjusted in settings. Roy Not necessarily. Xda reported that in some units the red-tinted display is not being fixed even after adjusting the rgb and samung is replaging those units. Also, why this reviewed unit was not adjusted before taking the pictures? Just look at them and tell me, the issue is pretty noticeable. Rod Don't worry, there are lots of people in denial here. Rod Oh boy... https://i.imgur.com/oYe2HPZ.jpg Rod Nope. ×XWreckTeamX× Which pics are you talking about I cant notice it that much. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ It seems pretty obvious to me in all the photos of the phone where there's white on the display. The white looks pinkish. The screen shots look pure white, though. morrisp Are you in Studio City, David? Ahmad Alnusif Is this review applicable also to the Exynos version of S8+? I see mention of SnapDragon 835 specific features so will they be there in the international version? Fred Question is, where did you get that burger ? Anton Kuznetsov ADOPTABLE STORAGE Does it have it? Rod Seeing as they blocked it in the S7, I wouldn't hold my breath. Nathan J This is the first Android phone since last April when I chose the iPhone 6s over the LG G5 (which, given the bootloop reports, was probably a good choice) that has made me seriously consider switching back. One thought keeps repeating itself to me: the 2015 iPhone 6s will most likely get updates for one year after the 2017 Galaxy S8 stops getting them, given the companies' five and two year update ranges. I can see entry level phones only getting a year or two of updates, but a $750 or $850 phone? This is a hard truth that Android fanboys are going to have to accept, and really start demanding changes to. It's one thing that Apple absolutely does better, and I think it's something that would not be very hard to change. Let's demand five years of updates. Apple can do it and they're more profitable than anyone. Stop. Don't make excuses about why Apple's phones aren't that good or their updates aren't as significant. Don't excuse bad behavior. Have the courage to demand better. If all the phone manufacturers adopted all the best practices of their competitors, and shed their biggest problems, imagine how much more awesome phones would be. That said, we really don't know how long Samsung will update the S8. Maybe they give it three years. Who knows. They've done almost everything right here, and I commend them for that. I wouldn't have minded if they kept the physical home/fingerprint button, if they did it like on the iPhone 7. Not a real button but a part of the screen that vibrates in such a way that feels like a button. Go to a Best Buy and check it out. It's very cool. The fingerprint scanner as-is on the S8... I have seen no one praise this. I'm sure Samsung knows, and it was just too late for them to change it. If everything is the same next year (but updated of course), but the fingerprint reader is mid-center of the back, the S9 will be damn near perfect. As for Bixby — in my opinion, the less said about it, Siri, and Google Assistant, the better. I'll just Google it. Or Bing it if I know I'll be running into ad-infested sites (like Wikia) as the Google app tunnels around my ad blocker (iOS). Either way, I'll take a search app over an assistant app any day of the week. I've tried Siri, Google, and Cortana and have found all of them lacking. So no thanks to Bixby. Disappointing about buttongate, but not a dealbreaker, either. Rod In most cases, the updates are ceased due to the SoC vendor (read: Qualcomm) not providing new blobs after 24 months. That's why there's a rumor Google is designing its own chip, like Apple and Samsung do, so they don't get blocked by Qualcomm. Nathan J I had a Motorola Photon. We heard all the excuses. At the end of the day, it's still a flagship that got zero updates, so it doesn't really matter whose fault it is or why. I mean, it's interesting on a trivial level to find out why, but you're no less screwed at the end of the day. That said, if Google could get control over the hardware in their phones, they'd be better off. Maybe. Can they make more money selling phones that are supported for five years? That's a cycle and a half they're pissing away. Apple can take that. Rod I really hope Google pulls an Apple someday. 5 years of support sounds great to me. Talos the Robot You are reviewing a defected phone with a red tint display and you are awarding it with editor's choice "Most Wanted" accolade, hahaha LOL.... francoism Still sure it'll suffer from the much staggered OTA updates. roverstim Seriously, no mention of the pink screen in the review ?

Actions on Google (third-party services for Assistant) will come to languages other than US English... one day Rita El Khoury Follow View All Posts 2017/04/19 5:45am PDTApr 19, 2017 5 Plus 1 on G+ 12 Share on Facebook 34 Share on Twitter Total Shares51 Google News If you bought a Google Home in the UK, you may be wondering why your new gadget feels less powerful than what you had expected. Sure, you can ask it questions and play music, but the services supported aren't as numerous as what you originally thought. Where's Logitech for example? And Todoist? And all those fancy names you keep reading about? Well, they should be under Services in the Assistant settings of your Google Home, but they're not. That's for one reason: the Actions on Google platform, which was opened to devs last December, is only available in US English. Add this to the list of inconsistencies with Assistant. Oh, oh, and the fact that Actions on Google are, for now, only accessible from Assistant on Home and not on phones, Pixels, or other devices. Not to beat a dead horse, but those distinctions are starting to get very annoying. You shouldn't be thinking about what you can do, in which language, in which syntax (services require you to say "talk to X" first), and on which device when you want something from a smart "assistant." The slightly good news though is that Google is working on bringing more language support to the Actions on Google platform. When? Googler Wayne Piekarski says he has no formal release date, but it's happening. They'll let us know when they let us know. In other words, cross your fingers and hope for the best. It's nice though to see someone at Google acknowledging the missing features for our friends across the pond.

Rita El Khoury You mean on the support pages? Yeah, that page seems gone. Tom Erlandsen This feels like the kind of thing that maybe should have been worked out BEFORE releasing Home in the UK? neoKushan Given they announced a load of new partners at almost the exact same time they announced the UK launch, I (Naively) assumed the two were related and that they only wanted to do the UK launch after they had enough partners on board to suit that market. Nope, just shitty communication from Google as per usual. Mario Wouldn't simply setting the device to US english help? Are US and UK so different? Rita El Khoury I know some users who have done that, but from their experience, it can't always recognize their British accent then. They'd have to speak with an American accent to make it work more reliably. Not sure if anyone has faced the same issue, but that's what I was told. Guy R Bailey You can but it's a pain mike shwilly It's almost the same only on paper Darek Czubacki With a last name of Piekarski, I would hope that my native tongue of Polish will be supported soon in Google Assistant as it was in Google Now. Google Now supported a primary voice search language as well as a secondary. Matt Great point. But even Google Now in Polish, doesn't have that many commands as in English. Google Now in Polish is really useful for one of my friends and I hope they support stuff more soon. Tomáš Petrík Yeah, one day, I have a dream I will be able to say "navigate to Základná škola Sándora Petöfiho" and it will understand. Atoqir They are starting to be like Microsoft these days it seems. makapav 'Old Microsoft'. Atoqir Not really, after almost 2 years after release Cortana is still not available in countries like Belgium and the Netherlands makapav It's very clear to me that Google Home will not be ready until 2018 winter. They aimed too high without any drugs for their deteriorating condition from ADHD. Way too much promise and hype at launch. King_Android I mean this would be a major project. Can they get around to offering more support while also building up Assistant? I mean its a robust assistant that just got introduced and needs to be refined more. Siri was a total mess when released and is not much better. At least Google is obviously making strides into getting GA to everyone. People will complain about anything. Deeco We are Beta testers to Google. As much as I hate to admit it, but Apple does It's shit right from day one before releasing to general public unlike Google. Andy J Now...... if they could just go ahead and explain what EXACTLY the technical issue is - how exactly can something like a text based adventure, or even actions you have written yourself , not be supported. There is a text to speech engine, it supports British English. There is a speech to text engine, it too supports British English. So what is technical reason Google - given that the 2 major parts of the system both support British English, and the "agents" / "services" / "actions" - whatever they are being called today, are 3rd party and therefore outside your control. I wouldn't be half as upset if you would at least let us run the previews of our own actions on our own devices - but nope, that's not supported either.

Some Pixel phones are having problems with backups, Google is looking into it Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/04/20 10:35am PDTApr 20, 2017 22 Plus 1 on G+ 14 Share on Facebook 42 Share on Twitter Total Shares78 Bug Watch Google News Pixel Pixel XL Some users have been experiencing issues with backup on Google's Pixel devices, most notably backups of SMS, call history, and apps, although other accounts of all backup types failing have also been reported.  The current cause isn't known, but reports of the problem on Google's product forums stretch back to just after the launch of the device, and for many the matter remains unresolved. Even one of Google's support specialists discovered he was experiencing the issue, but apart from reaching out to those affected for bug reports no information has been publicly provided. To be clear, for those with the problem their personal data in one or more categories may not be being backed up as they would expect. Not to be alarmist, but with this backup error occurring silently, it might be prudent for Pixel users to check that their devices are, in fact, performing their backups as expected and intended. To check for yourself, navigate to Settings, Backup and Reset, Backup and see if any of the items listed under Content are "Waiting to backup." If you are among those suffering the problem you might want to exercise some caution and consider another backup method for whatever might be failing for you. Also, feel free to add your voices (and log-files) down at Google's product forums. They're currently reaching out to those affected there for additional information, and with more data the issue can probably be fixed that much more quickly.

If this is all it is, hardly anybody is going to care. And those that do care probably should be using multiple forms of backup anyway. Sachin Bahal Same here Suicide_Note Same. That's the only one that had any issue on my device. steb0ne Same here... So most people in this comment section who actually have Pixel devices seem to be having the same issue with the call history not backing up and a bunch of trolling by other people talking about how it's plagued with bugs, lol! Got it! I wonder how long it's been acting up... Everything else shows backed up this morning. If this is a daily backup and it didn't backup one day is this really that big of a deal? The screenshot posted shows December... I'm curious to know is this a Google feature or Pixel feature? Can someone else with a phone running Nougat confirm if theirs is backing up? teh Jax Definitely a lot of trolling and ignorance going on in these comments. That's pretty typical by people commenting about a premium device that they either can't buy or chose not to buy - it helps them justify their situation. Which is fine by me. It's rare that comments are actually insightful. ¯_(ツ)_/¯ teddyfrozevelt Mine hasn't backed up since I factory reset it in december. Everything else has backed up. Impulse_Vigil It's an Android feature, has been forever, but O and the Pixel are the first places where it's status has been exposed and broken down by category. So it may or may not be working elsewhere, you wouldn't really know. Now freak out! Heh... steb0ne That's what I thought... So it's possibly happening on other non Pixel devices. The article made it seem Pixel specific CJ Me too. Maxr1998 Same for me, Nexus 6P, O Preview. Also had that issue for SMS & apps after I clean-flashed the update, but I could at least fix the latter by manually running "bmgr backupnow --all" in a su shell. SMS somehow resolved itself it seems. Impulse_Vigil Same, everything else is backed up, didn't even know call history could be backed up. 4Ui812 Better call Saul. Bat Man 1 day = 1 problem? 4Ui812 Nausea, heartburn, indigestion, upset stomach, diarrhea.... Google's quality control is hard at work. Middlefinger Yeah, but at least it gets 'Timely updates' /s Phalkon30 Just bought my 6p 2 weeks ago, not a single thing moved to it from my previous device. It's like I never had a Google history, even though I have app backups on my Google Drive. I even tried to to set up from another device, it gave an unknown error and moved nothing I'm going to have to root to fix it, awful backup solution sproc I think it only works with the same phone honestly, cause otherwise I bet no one uses it sadly. Tiuri Elvander Sent in my 6p for an RMA, it was fully backed up. Tried to restore the backup on my replacement 6p but it only offered my One plus One (which I used while I was waiting for my replacement). The whole thing lasted less than a week, yet my original backup was not available as an option to restore. Very annoying!! Jordan VanCampen Same here. My work phone which is a Moto z play stopped working. I got a replacement and thought that I'd be able restore it from the previous one, but nope. The setup process only gave me the option to restore from my Vizio tablet that came with my TV that I recently bought. My pixel that is my personal phone wasn't an option. So I decided that I would use the NFC option. So I I did that with my pixel and it didn't restore anything at all. The backup situation on Android is still pretty much a dumpster fire. Ryne Hager I've had the restore from previous device thing bug out as well, I usually just set everything up as a new device now. blindexecutioner $800 device running never-ending beta software. Jingwei Zhang It does backup a lot of settings for many apps. As for games, if the game requires logging in, it backs up the log in information if you had it set as memorized. It also memorizes the layout of the apps. The backup is definitely not the best, but it's automatic and much more comprehensive than the native backup other manufacturers provide, including ios. Roy Hm, no. I used an iphone and ipod touch ages ago and they actually have a backup solution that works. When you restore, it's like you never left - even between devices. Even Blackberry had a better backup system than Android ever has - the only decent backup solution Android has is Titanium backup (which is, to be fair, excellent), and that requires root so most people are SOL. I've never even had my wifi settings restored properly, even though that's supposedly backed up. Jingwei Zhang Hm, no. We have six iPhones in the family and none of them backup like you said here (like you never left). However, my Nexus to Pixel transfer was like that. All apps, photos, sms and etc were restored to the same position and most pertinent settings were restored. IIRC, the phone even restored my company's WIFI setting with the correct credential. I don't know which android phone you have, but Google's backup does some pretty amazing things for requiring absolutely no maintenance on the user's side. EDIT: I just remembered. My sister and mom actually use Google Photo on their iPhone 6S/7 because it's free and easy as opposed to the tiny iCloud storage. JohnyNoLegs Its free when it compresses your photos. Also iPhone does whole phone backup, android does not. Also if you lose your pixel right now, you are screwed, as you can't do a transfer. Jingwei Zhang IIRC Pixel has full photo backup without any compression. I believe I specifically said that it does some amazing things with absolutely no user side maintenance. You can always do a manual full backup with titanium or in recovery. Root and unlocked bootloader are needed, but that's just takes a few minutes with Nexus and Pixel. How is that? Everything is automatically backed up including video, pic and sms, call history and etc on a daily basis. I would wager that you can retrieve more current information from a lost Pixel/Nexus than from a lost iPhone if they were both lost and went completely off the grid. JohnyNoLegs Wager away, then send me the money. iPhone does a bit for bit backup, it backs up the current state of the whole iPhone. Google does not do this. Google selectively backs up items like call history, sms etc. Pixel is the only Android phone that offers uncompressed backup for free, not really an option for everyone mate. Titanium backup is for ROOT LOLOLOLOL. Recovery is for unlocked devices LOLOLOLOLOL iPhone does complete backup with any hacking required, talk about no user side maintenance! BTW, my Pixel stopped backup up photos, it's a bug. Doesn't sound like no user maintenance required haha Jingwei Zhang hmm comparing full backup that can take upwards of an hour to one that runs in the background huh? You definitely understand what no user maintenance is and are certainly brilliant. Comparing apple to orange as long as it suits your narrative. Are we talking about any other android phone? I don't think so. Unlocking bootloader and granting root access are considered hacking now? Bugs and failures happen, just like how two of our iPhone 6 bricked just out of warranty. Also, my Pixel is not experiencing this bug, so it's not a problem for me (yet). JohnyNoLegs Think logically for a second mate. You are talking a out no user maintenance. IPhone does full backups while you sleep. Android does not. To root your phone and unlock the bootloader requires user maintenance. Impulse_Vigil I do think iOS backup functionality is more comprehensive, it doesn't leave things up to individual devs either... OTOH it does gobble up a pretty decent amount of storage on accounts where people often end up having to pay extra for... Nothing is perfect. JohnyNoLegs It's true, but for the person who just wants their stuff backed up, IOS has it covered much better than android. Even the simplicity of setting up iCloud to do everything is great. In Android it is a bit all over the shop in deep settings and different apps. I'm fine with Androids implementation, but then again I don't care about doing factory resets etc which is kinda the nature of android. iPhone users perhaps are less used to having to restore their data all the time. Ryne Hager I think it backs up some appdata, like Netflix login information carrying over to new devices, that sort of thing. JohnyNoLegs After an RMA and a few factory resets, I can tell you it hasn't in my case. Impulse_Vigil It can do that, but apps need to be written for it, backup has always been a joke on Android but it's largely because devs ignore the existing tools tbh. Killa I'm not seeing any option on my Nexus 6 in the Backup & Reset area that shows the breakout of the different backup content like it does in the image above. There's just the On/Off switch and language that says backups are in Google Drive...etc. Is this only a Pixel thing or higher version of Android? Phalkon30 Must be a pixel thing, I don't see it on my 6P either, and I'm on 7.1.2 Cyan Thayn It's also an O thing apparently, have the exact menu shown in the screenshots on my 6P on the O preview (and have the same bugs as well!). Ryne Hager It's a pixel thing, no need to worry. Impulse_Vigil I'm not even sure what the point is, I guess extra info and transparency (which is good), because none of those options really do anything but tell you what's being backed up. There's nothing to toggle besides the main backup option and the option to backup to Drive. Shoot, other phones could be suffering the same issues but because the backup status isn't displayed nobody would know! On my Pixel everything but call history is up to date, and I couldn't care less about that. Ishimaru Another day, another Pixel issue. Ramon Google is fucking up a lot lately. What's taking so long to fire some people? Just not just lately Conrad Okay, so what happened to the review of the Synology 416play? I'd really like to read it! lomsha Some premium device lol. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Once again, I told you so. You should really run a daily series called "Google Screwup Of The Day". Ryne Hager Your name is amazing. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Not many people get it. ;) J.J. Pixel and problem are two words heard often lately! Leif Sikorski Same with previous Nexus and some other Google Hardware devices. It's one reason why I'm glad that other OEMs update slower these days. Google keeps giving me the impression that they still see their devices as geeky developer devices where the user does the final testing. If they want to be more serious with their hardware efforts and compete with the big brands they need to invest much more money into testing and customer support. Ryne Hager Eh, bugs happen with any tech, and the volume of problems has gotten a lot smaller than things used to be back in the day. Progress has its pitfalls, is all. Nick I'm with you here. I get that people expect nothing but excellence from a device that they paid a pretty penny for, but stuff happens sometimes and so far it hasn't been anything that warrants the level of indignation I am seeing here in the comment section. I'm sure Google will fix the issue as soon as they possibly can. JohnyNoLegs And by progress, you mean they haven't really done anything different right? Still the same updates with bugs, still take ages to fix anything. I am still having the worst bluetooth experience of any phone I have owned, and that's after an RMA already! Anon Now we know why the pixel includes 24/7 support. Lisarbeams Managing director of Google!, is explaining to users to start off "Work at home" method, that People have been doing for about one year now.

I'm looking forward to seeing what problems the S8 has over the next 6 months. By the way, is Bixby's working yet? Mike Bastable The Pixel handsets seen to be agreeing poorly... Lot of bugs recently... Sachin Bahal no device will ever be perfect, there will always be some issue(s) during a device's life cycle, and it just so happens that the Pixel's issues/bugs are happening 6 months into the phone's life cycle Ryne Hager Yeah, I expect they'll probably get things fixed. Bugs happen. Sachin Bahal The Pixel is just crawling with bugs ;) Hussain Ahmadi And some go on to call this crap as best Android phone? A big joke and Google has made a really big joke of itself by releasing this iAndroid phone!! Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ The Pixel is STILL listed as the Best Android Phone on most sites, despite all the problems, the halos in the pictures, etc. Even though I NEVER thought it deserved that status, I can understand that most of its problems surfaced after web magazines rated it. But it's clear now that the phone sucks and its software sucks. If publishing had any integrity, they'd issue a correction, revoke that title and make some other phone the best phone of 2016. Impulse_Vigil Or most of the problems aren't really as wide spread as some seem to believe, I've had pretty much no issues with mine. Marty I had a Google backup issue on my OP3T. I factory wiped it after an update and the restore function usually seen during set up didn't appear. YaKillaCJ Something about that picture just bugs me... Impulse_Vigil I see what you did there!

Phil This problem is only being reported by people enrolled on the beta testing of Android O ffs. Of course there are going to be bugs with am OS still in the testing stage. That's the whole point isn't it? Give people an early look in order that they can identify bugs and instabilities? The problem is not the phone, it a Dev version of an OS. Kevin Sword Loving your hero images Ryne! Mr.Bean ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ We're gonna need a can of Raid to squash these bugs. Muzaffar Don't mind the bugs, as long as it get stock android and latest update. ashjas Are these options only pixel specific..? I mean I don't see such backup options on my Nexus 4 with nougut custom rom? Impulse_Vigil Call history is waiting to be backed up here weird, everything else is current. I didn't even know my phone backed up call history tbh... Seems I've gotten ultra lucky with Pixel bugs, outside a handful of sporadic instances of Bluetooth turning off thru the start of the year I've avoided just about everything else. Got mine in November FWIW, tap on wood. Bala Same here since day one for SMS and call history ,it's funny when they say they are looking into. A feature that's supposed to work with final release is not working for a while and still they are looking Jan Machovec Is this something Pixel specific? Because I don't see any option to backup SMS, Call log and others on my SGS7.

Home Issues Experts Newsletters & Trading Services Login Attention Digital News Sites: Your Death is Imminent Posted on April 20, 2017 by Brad Hoppmann The law of the jungle, both in nature and in the corporate world, is simple. Adapt or die. For the once-mighty online media giant Yahoo! (YHOO), it just couldn’t adapt. Now, the company’s web business is being swallowed up by a much-bigger telecom behemoth, Verizon Communications (VZ). The takeover deal is set to close in June. That means Yahoo’s quarterly earnings announcement, released Tuesday, is likely the company’s official last reporting hurrah. (At least, as its own entity.) I must admit that I am a bit saddened by the decline in Yahoo! in recent years. Sure, the company failed to report two major customer database hacks. Yet I still use many of its websites for quick news gathering. There are still plenty of other customers like me who frequent the Yahoo! news pages. But when it comes to advertisers, well, they’re looking elsewhere. That’s the message of a story this week in The Atlantic with the ominous title, "Yahoo’s Demise Is a Death Knell for Digital News Orgs." The story speculates about Yahoo’s struggle to capture advertising dollars. The same struggle is likely to be seen across the web, particularly among news and information organizations that rely heavily on advertising for the bulk of their revenue. Here’s the money quote from the piece: Yahoo’s demise is a signal that web-native companies are next. If you run a business that relies on digital-advertising revenue for an outsized portion of your funding, you need to find new streams of revenue. Now. It may already be too late. This should make anyone in the online news business think hard about how to adapt. So, where are all the online advertising dollars going? Simple. They’re going where the customers are … and that means they’re going to Facebook (FB) and Google, aka Alphabet (GOOGL). Here’s how The Atlantic tells it: Facebook and Google are practically drowning in ad revenue — together they command a huge portion of global digital-ad dollars — and that’s the root of the problem for every other business trying to clamor for a piece of it. The precise estimates vary. One often-repeated stat, based on last year’s financials, is that Facebook and Google account for 85-percent of every new dollar spent on digital advertising. That doesn’t leave much room — only about 15%, to be precise — of every new ad dollar to be spread out among the thousands of other digital news sites, blogs, niche publications, etc. Yet the situation might even be far worse than that. *** The Atlantic story cites one industry expert, Jason Kint of Digital Content Next. He estimates that Facebook and Google accounted for about 99% of all advertising growth in the third quarter of 2016. (54% Google, 45% Facebook, 1% everybody else.) Facebook shares are up 25% in 2017; Alphabet/Google is up 8.7% so far this year. Per The Atlantic: "The ad-tech market will go the way of search, social, and mobile as investors and entrepreneurs concede that Google and Facebook have won and everyone else has lost," the venture capitalist and blogger Fred Wilson wrote in January. "It will be nearly impossible to raise money for an online advertising business in 2017." If this is true, it could have a tremendous dislocating effect on a lot of news sites that you might visit regularly. Moreover, it could concentrate more and more information into fewer and fewer hands. And this would represent a distinct reversal of the democratization of news we’ve seen since the explosion of the digital info age. Of course, if this is true, then the logical investment thesis is to embrace FB and GOOGL … which both now trade at or near their respective all-time highs. *** Fear is rising too, although perhaps not as quickly as Facebook and Google’s share prices. So, trying to trade the Volatility Index isn’t the best way to play it. However, the "real" fear index is looking like a good bet, according to our small-cap mining expert Sean Brodrick. A very good bet, in fact. Take it away, Sean … Mining for Money The Real Fear Index By Sean Brodrick Do you want to see a picture of fear? Just look at what’s happening in the world’s largest gold ETF. The SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE: GLD) added 11.84 metric tons of gold on April 19. That’s the most since Sept. 6, 2016. And it brought the GLD’s holding to 860.76 metric tons. That’s 27,674,076 troy ounces. What’s driving this? Fear. North Korea is turning up the heat on its nuclear threat. In fact, North Korean state media just warned the United States of a "super-mighty preemptive strike." What does that mean? Who the heck knows! We do know that the U.S. is now calling North Korea an "imminent threat." And you can bet people are hedging nuclear fears with gold. Related story: When U.S. Stocks are Expensive, and Volatile Meanwhile, the Trump administration may walk away from the nuclear deal with Iran. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said Wednesday that Iran, if left "unchecked," could follow North Korea’s path to becoming a nuclear rogue nation. "The evidence is clear. Iran’s provocative actions threaten the U.S., the region and the world." Tillerson said. Another nuclear threat? Maybe. And maybe time for more gold. Related story: A Slow March to Nuclear War Then take the French election. (Please!) The two leading contenders are, on the right, someone who wants to take France out of the euro and NATO. And, on the left, a good ol’ fashioned left-wing socialist. Yeah, that’s gonna make investors nervous either way. These are the known problems. But you can bet your bottom krugerrand that the market is starting to worry about black swans, too. The events you can’t predict. You know who else is buying gold? Russia. Slowly, steadily, the Russians add to their Smaug-worthy hoard o’ gold every month. Russia’s gold holdings just hit 54 million troy ounces. That’s up 800,000 troy ounces in one month. But it’s the tip of an iceberg that has been rising for years. Here is a chart of official Russian gold holdings since 2011. Russia has its own fears, its own problems. One is the fear of U.S. sanctions, which bite even harder because the U.S. dollar is the world’s reserve currency. I believe Russia has long-term plans to change that. That’s a goal shared by some of our other "frenemies," including China and Saudi Arabia. They all chafe under the mighty U.S. dollar as the world’s reserve currency. That’s one reason why the world’s central banks keep buying gold. To diversify away from greenbacks. And ALL the world’s leaders share one fear in common: That the global financial system could come crashing down like a wobbly Jenga tower. And gold is a great way to insure against currency and financial unrest, too. So why are investors shoving more money into the GLD? Fear. It’s the real Fear Index. What Lies Ahead We can’t predict the future. But we already know we are in a bullish cycle for gold. Supply/demand forces are in play that should shift prices into higher gear. Now, add to that, it sure seems like we are in a cycle of worsening global tensions. Increasing conflicts. And heightening global fears. The fear index is pointing up — for gold.

Good luck and happy investing, Brad Hoppmann Publisher Uncommon Wisdom Daily Your thoughts on “Attention Digital News Sites: Your Death is Imminent” ron goddard says: April 20, 2017 at 7:00 pm hi brad. i really look forward to reading your articles. it is obvious where and why the gold is going. china and russia have been smart these past few years, and i don’t think that u.s.a. sanctions will worry russia too much despite what the western press or anybody else thinks. the russians have gone along quite nicely even taking into account the vitrillic press they receive. same for assad and syria. once again it is obvious that the chemical warfare thing was just another w.m.d. (bush) rumour, but acted heavily on by the ‘allies’. how many countries have suffered once they have lost their ‘dictators’; countries that have been obliterated by the democratic forces of the heroic west. being a citizen of oz, and having access to many sources including lots from u.s.a. it is becoming apparent that many things we believed to be true in the past have simply been lies. i find that very disturbing. can we not trust our ‘leaders’ any more? is there any credibility left in our western world where the m.s.m. media keep lying to us? many of my friends are unaware of anything more than their local newspaper and ‘conspiracy theories’, but really, how much stuff can we discount as being a theory when after a while they become fact? quite simply if you want to strike a match to set a fire one needs an abrasive surface to strike. (match and matchbox) take either one away and you won’t get a flame. now which one is the match and which is the matchbox? u.s.a. or north korea. u.s.a or russia? u.s.a. or iran. u.s.a. or china? golly the same country comes up every time; the good ol’ u.s.a. the world policeman! is there a message there? now the latest info. just come to hand is that the russians have just immobilised the alaskan us.a. air bases because pres. putin was very angry over an article in ‘vanity fair’ saying that russian people were medieval and not worth saving..just blast them away. really?? wow, just who is the savage here? but you won’t read that bit about alaska in the western press(m.s.m). it keeps the western world ignorant en masse about the truth, furthermore pres. putin has promised that any more b.s. like vanity fair he will take out all of the u.s.a. airforce and navy throughout the world. and he has the capability!! buy gold ? certainly. you might need it if your power goes off across the nation soon. sorry brad but that how it is. the u.s.a. military needs to go home and all will be well. cheers, ron from oz.

Some Pixel phones are having problems with backups, Google is looking into it Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/04/20 10:35am PDTApr 20, 2017 22 Plus 1 on G+ 14 Share on Facebook 42 Share on Twitter Total Shares78 Bug Watch Google News Pixel Pixel XL Some users have been experiencing issues with backup on Google's Pixel devices, most notably backups of SMS, call history, and apps, although other accounts of all backup types failing have also been reported.  The current cause isn't known, but reports of the problem on Google's product forums stretch back to just after the launch of the device, and for many the matter remains unresolved. Even one of Google's support specialists discovered he was experiencing the issue, but apart from reaching out to those affected for bug reports no information has been publicly provided. To be clear, for those with the problem their personal data in one or more categories may not be being backed up as they would expect. Not to be alarmist, but with this backup error occurring silently, it might be prudent for Pixel users to check that their devices are, in fact, performing their backups as expected and intended. To check for yourself, navigate to Settings, Backup and Reset, Backup and see if any of the items listed under Content are "Waiting to backup." If you are among those suffering the problem you might want to exercise some caution and consider another backup method for whatever might be failing for you. Also, feel free to add your voices (and log-files) down at Google's product forums. They're currently reaching out to those affected there for additional information, and with more data the issue can probably be fixed that much more quickly.

Gustavo Me too, also only seeing it in Call History on my Pixel teh Jax At least the important ones are working fine! Andrew same here Ryne Hager That's not a huge deal, then. Not the worst thing to lose if your phone eats it. Photos or SMS could be a bigger problem, though. teh Jax Right. If somebody is experiencing this bug with other pieces of data, this is a big deal! If this is all it is, hardly anybody is going to care. And those that do care probably should be using multiple forms of backup anyway. Sachin Bahal Same here Suicide_Note Same. That's the only one that had any issue on my device. steb0ne Same here... So most people in this comment section who actually have Pixel devices seem to be having the same issue with the call history not backing up and a bunch of trolling by other people talking about how it's plagued with bugs, lol! Got it! I wonder how long it's been acting up... Everything else shows backed up this morning. If this is a daily backup and it didn't backup one day is this really that big of a deal? The screenshot posted shows December... I'm curious to know is this a Google feature or Pixel feature? Can someone else with a phone running Nougat confirm if theirs is backing up? teh Jax Definitely a lot of trolling and ignorance going on in these comments. That's pretty typical by people commenting about a premium device that they either can't buy or chose not to buy - it helps them justify their situation. Which is fine by me. It's rare that comments are actually insightful. ¯_(ツ)_/¯ teddyfrozevelt Mine hasn't backed up since I factory reset it in december. Everything else has backed up. Impulse_Vigil It's an Android feature, has been forever, but O and the Pixel are the first places where it's status has been exposed and broken down by category. So it may or may not be working elsewhere, you wouldn't really know. Now freak out! Heh... steb0ne That's what I thought... So it's possibly happening on other non Pixel devices. The article made it seem Pixel specific CJ Me too. Maxr1998 Same for me, Nexus 6P, O Preview. Also had that issue for SMS & apps after I clean-flashed the update, but I could at least fix the latter by manually running "bmgr backupnow --all" in a su shell. SMS somehow resolved itself it seems. Impulse_Vigil Same, everything else is backed up, didn't even know call history could be backed up. 4Ui812 Better call Saul. Bat Man 1 day = 1 problem? 4Ui812 Nausea, heartburn, indigestion, upset stomach, diarrhea.... Google's quality control is hard at work. Middlefinger Yeah, but at least it gets 'Timely updates' /s Phalkon30 Just bought my 6p 2 weeks ago, not a single thing moved to it from my previous device. It's like I never had a Google history, even though I have app backups on my Google Drive. I even tried to to set up from another device, it gave an unknown error and moved nothing I'm going to have to root to fix it, awful backup solution sproc I think it only works with the same phone honestly, cause otherwise I bet no one uses it sadly. Tiuri Elvander Sent in my 6p for an RMA, it was fully backed up. Tried to restore the backup on my replacement 6p but it only offered my One plus One (which I used while I was waiting for my replacement). The whole thing lasted less than a week, yet my original backup was not available as an option to restore. Very annoying!! Jordan VanCampen Same here. My work phone which is a Moto z play stopped working. I got a replacement and thought that I'd be able restore it from the previous one, but nope. The setup process only gave me the option to restore from my Vizio tablet that came with my TV that I recently bought. My pixel that is my personal phone wasn't an option. So I decided that I would use the NFC option. So I I did that with my pixel and it didn't restore anything at all. The backup situation on Android is still pretty much a dumpster fire. Ryne Hager I've had the restore from previous device thing bug out as well, I usually just set everything up as a new device now. blindexecutioner $800 device running never-ending beta software. Jingwei Zhang It does backup a lot of settings for many apps. As for games, if the game requires logging in, it backs up the log in information if you had it set as memorized. It also memorizes the layout of the apps. The backup is definitely not the best, but it's automatic and much more comprehensive than the native backup other manufacturers provide, including ios. Roy Hm, no. I used an iphone and ipod touch ages ago and they actually have a backup solution that works. When you restore, it's like you never left - even between devices. Even Blackberry had a better backup system than Android ever has - the only decent backup solution Android has is Titanium backup (which is, to be fair, excellent), and that requires root so most people are SOL. I've never even had my wifi settings restored properly, even though that's supposedly backed up. Jingwei Zhang Hm, no. We have six iPhones in the family and none of them backup like you said here (like you never left). However, my Nexus to Pixel transfer was like that. All apps, photos, sms and etc were restored to the same position and most pertinent settings were restored. IIRC, the phone even restored my company's WIFI setting with the correct credential. I don't know which android phone you have, but Google's backup does some pretty amazing things for requiring absolutely no maintenance on the user's side. EDIT: I just remembered. My sister and mom actually use Google Photo on their iPhone 6S/7 because it's free and easy as opposed to the tiny iCloud storage. JohnyNoLegs Its free when it compresses your photos. Also iPhone does whole phone backup, android does not. Also if you lose your pixel right now, you are screwed, as you can't do a transfer. Jingwei Zhang IIRC Pixel has full photo backup without any compression. I believe I specifically said that it does some amazing things with absolutely no user side maintenance. You can always do a manual full backup with titanium or in recovery. Root and unlocked bootloader are needed, but that's just takes a few minutes with Nexus and Pixel. How is that? Everything is automatically backed up including video, pic and sms, call history and etc on a daily basis. I would wager that you can retrieve more current information from a lost Pixel/Nexus than from a lost iPhone if they were both lost and went completely off the grid. JohnyNoLegs Wager away, then send me the money. iPhone does a bit for bit backup, it backs up the current state of the whole iPhone. Google does not do this. Google selectively backs up items like call history, sms etc. Pixel is the only Android phone that offers uncompressed backup for free, not really an option for everyone mate. Titanium backup is for ROOT LOLOLOLOL. Recovery is for unlocked devices LOLOLOLOLOL iPhone does complete backup with any hacking required, talk about no user side maintenance! BTW, my Pixel stopped backup up photos, it's a bug. Doesn't sound like no user maintenance required haha Jingwei Zhang hmm comparing full backup that can take upwards of an hour to one that runs in the background huh? You definitely understand what no user maintenance is and are certainly brilliant. Comparing apple to orange as long as it suits your narrative. Are we talking about any other android phone? I don't think so. Unlocking bootloader and granting root access are considered hacking now? Bugs and failures happen, just like how two of our iPhone 6 bricked just out of warranty. Also, my Pixel is not experiencing this bug, so it's not a problem for me (yet). JohnyNoLegs Think logically for a second mate. You are talking a out no user maintenance. IPhone does full backups while you sleep. Android does not. To root your phone and unlock the bootloader requires user maintenance. Impulse_Vigil I do think iOS backup functionality is more comprehensive, it doesn't leave things up to individual devs either... OTOH it does gobble up a pretty decent amount of storage on accounts where people often end up having to pay extra for... Nothing is perfect. JohnyNoLegs It's true, but for the person who just wants their stuff backed up, IOS has it covered much better than android. Even the simplicity of setting up iCloud to do everything is great. In Android it is a bit all over the shop in deep settings and different apps. I'm fine with Androids implementation, but then again I don't care about doing factory resets etc which is kinda the nature of android. iPhone users perhaps are less used to having to restore their data all the time. Ryne Hager I think it backs up some appdata, like Netflix login information carrying over to new devices, that sort of thing. JohnyNoLegs After an RMA and a few factory resets, I can tell you it hasn't in my case. Impulse_Vigil It can do that, but apps need to be written for it, backup has always been a joke on Android but it's largely because devs ignore the existing tools tbh. Killa I'm not seeing any option on my Nexus 6 in the Backup & Reset area that shows the breakout of the different backup content like it does in the image above. There's just the On/Off switch and language that says backups are in Google Drive...etc. Is this only a Pixel thing or higher version of Android? Phalkon30 Must be a pixel thing, I don't see it on my 6P either, and I'm on 7.1.2 Cyan Thayn It's also an O thing apparently, have the exact menu shown in the screenshots on my 6P on the O preview (and have the same bugs as well!). Ryne Hager It's a pixel thing, no need to worry. Impulse_Vigil I'm not even sure what the point is, I guess extra info and transparency (which is good), because none of those options really do anything but tell you what's being backed up. There's nothing to toggle besides the main backup option and the option to backup to Drive. Shoot, other phones could be suffering the same issues but because the backup status isn't displayed nobody would know! On my Pixel everything but call history is up to date, and I couldn't care less about that. Ishimaru Another day, another Pixel issue. Ramon Google is fucking up a lot lately. What's taking so long to fire some people? Just not just lately Conrad Okay, so what happened to the review of the Synology 416play? I'd really like to read it! lomsha Some premium device lol. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Once again, I told you so. You should really run a daily series called "Google Screwup Of The Day". Ryne Hager Your name is amazing. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Not many people get it. ;) J.J. Pixel and problem are two words heard often lately! Leif Sikorski Same with previous Nexus and some other Google Hardware devices. It's one reason why I'm glad that other OEMs update slower these days. Google keeps giving me the impression that they still see their devices as geeky developer devices where the user does the final testing. If they want to be more serious with their hardware efforts and compete with the big brands they need to invest much more money into testing and customer support. Ryne Hager Eh, bugs happen with any tech, and the volume of problems has gotten a lot smaller than things used to be back in the day. Progress has its pitfalls, is all. Nick I'm with you here. I get that people expect nothing but excellence from a device that they paid a pretty penny for, but stuff happens sometimes and so far it hasn't been anything that warrants the level of indignation I am seeing here in the comment section. I'm sure Google will fix the issue as soon as they possibly can. JohnyNoLegs And by progress, you mean they haven't really done anything different right? Still the same updates with bugs, still take ages to fix anything. I am still having the worst bluetooth experience of any phone I have owned, and that's after an RMA already! Anon Now we know why the pixel includes 24/7 support. Lisarbeams Managing director of Google!, is explaining to users to start off "Work at home" method, that People have been doing for about one year now.

Let's see what the bug list for the S8 looks like six months down the line! Phil We're already on a pink screen and what's it been? 2 weeks? I've not heard any reports of exploding Pixels so far at least. Most of the people trolling these articles are Sammy Knights who should know better. I'm looking forward to seeing what problems the S8 has over the next 6 months. By the way, is Bixby's working yet? Mike Bastable The Pixel handsets seen to be agreeing poorly... Lot of bugs recently... Sachin Bahal no device will ever be perfect, there will always be some issue(s) during a device's life cycle, and it just so happens that the Pixel's issues/bugs are happening 6 months into the phone's life cycle Ryne Hager Yeah, I expect they'll probably get things fixed. Bugs happen. Sachin Bahal The Pixel is just crawling with bugs ;) Hussain Ahmadi And some go on to call this crap as best Android phone? A big joke and Google has made a really big joke of itself by releasing this iAndroid phone!! Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ The Pixel is STILL listed as the Best Android Phone on most sites, despite all the problems, the halos in the pictures, etc. Even though I NEVER thought it deserved that status, I can understand that most of its problems surfaced after web magazines rated it. But it's clear now that the phone sucks and its software sucks. If publishing had any integrity, they'd issue a correction, revoke that title and make some other phone the best phone of 2016. Impulse_Vigil Or most of the problems aren't really as wide spread as some seem to believe, I've had pretty much no issues with mine. Marty I had a Google backup issue on my OP3T. I factory wiped it after an update and the restore function usually seen during set up didn't appear. YaKillaCJ Something about that picture just bugs me... Impulse_Vigil I see what you did there! Have a ^ Arcest Not new adb restore failed to re-install apk https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/37130390 Sir_Brizz Compromise free device. Actually getting tired of making this joke, which says something. Impulse_Vigil Compromise and bug free since Nov here. /shrug New_Guy Geez, they Pixel has so many issues, it's crazy... Phil This problem is only being reported by people enrolled on the beta testing of Android O ffs. Of course there are going to be bugs with am OS still in the testing stage. That's the whole point isn't it? Give people an early look in order that they can identify bugs and instabilities? The problem is not the phone, it a Dev version of an OS. Kevin Sword Loving your hero images Ryne! Mr.Bean ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ We're gonna need a can of Raid to squash these bugs. Muzaffar Don't mind the bugs, as long as it get stock android and latest update. ashjas Are these options only pixel specific..? I mean I don't see such backup options on my Nexus 4 with nougut custom rom? Impulse_Vigil Call history is waiting to be backed up here weird, everything else is current. I didn't even know my phone backed up call history tbh... Seems I've gotten ultra lucky with Pixel bugs, outside a handful of sporadic instances of Bluetooth turning off thru the start of the year I've avoided just about everything else. Got mine in November FWIW, tap on wood. Bala Same here since day one for SMS and call history ,it's funny when they say they are looking into. A feature that's supposed to work with final release is not working for a while and still they are looking Jan Machovec Is this something Pixel specific? Because I don't see any option to backup SMS, Call log and others on my SGS7.

Multi-user voice recognition is rolling out to Google Home today Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/04/20 9:01am PDTApr 20, 2017 70 Plus 1 on G+ 125 Share on Facebook 89 Share on Twitter Total Shares284 Google News Videos Update 1: 2017/04/20 12:02pm PDT Here is the setup flow, courtesy of Artem Russakovskii: Bringing Google Assistant out of the phone and dropping it into Google Home comes with some difficulties. Not the least of which is, how do you handle personal account preferences and data when Google Home is available to everyone in the house? Until now the solution has been "don't." Starting today, you can register multiple users with your Google home, which recognizes them by voice. To set this up. look for a device card in the Home app that says"Multi-user is now available" or "Link your account." The setup process has you say the "OK Google" and "Hey Google" hotwords twice each. From then on, Google Home will be able to provide personal results because it knows who you are. The same is true for up to five other people in the house. The personal results affected by multi-user include My Day, calendars, flights, shopping lists, photos, and more. Each user of Google Home will also be asked to set some preferences for things like video and music services. If you set up a new user and don't do that, Google Home just defaults to the ones used by the first account. You can get started fiddling around with this today, but only in the US. Multi-user will roll out to the UK in the coming months.

Evolutionary at best. cusaitech Will this prevent ads from activating Google home? Jonathan Berry I believe unrecognized users will continue to work, just without the personalization it can do if it recognizes you. Shagnscooby I'm wondering if you can specify the default account if it's an unrecognized person. The biggest reason I've been looking forward to this is because of someone in my house using the Google Home for music with GPM and me in the car listening and it stops playing because of simultaneous streams. I'd probably specify one of my kids as the default account so it never overlaps my listening. Kakairo Yes! Can't wait to set this up when I get home. Hopefully adding calendar events and reminders isn't far behind. Carson Saldanha Roll out... :( Kakairo I've been lucky with roll outs lately, hopefully that streak continues. surethom UK coming month not good. Will this FINALLY let us ask for my music uploaded by artist name & song to play without a subscription? Defenestratus Thank goodness. I'm really sick of having my wife's terrible music selections showing up as recommendations in GPM. MrCalifornia If my wife doesn't have her own Google Music subscription can she not play music on Google Home anymore? Lisarbeams Managing director of Google!, is explaining to users to start off "Work at home" method, that People have been doing for about one year now. These days alone, I generated close to $36,000 until now with no more than my home computer as well as some spare time, despite that i have a fulltime 9 to 5 job. Even everyone not used to this, can make $89/per h easily and the earnings can go even higher over time...

Or can you ask for any Playlists from somone else's music uploaded? Still Google. Does not explain properly. trickytree1984 Same question Scott Olsen I'm guessing I still won't be able to link my work account to my personal account so that I can get both calendar events when I ask about my day. M. Luciano Not without sharing your calendar to the other account. F4LL0U7 My IT department blocks sharing our work calendars externally. gSyncit is the only thing that worked for me, and it works great. I love getting my work meeting agenda & reminders on my personal phone & watch. Check it out. http://www.fieldstonsoftware.com/software/gsyncit4/ lgg4 On this note, whats the best way to manage a gapps vs gmail account? I have my calendar, google drive and play store apps all on my gapps acocunt, but gplay music and non-business stuff on my gmail. Shoudl i try to transfer everything over to my consumer gmail account and just share my biz calendar to personal? I ask this as features seem to be limited at times with gapps accounts and when i linked my gapps with Home (due to my calendar), it says it cannot access my agenda. David Hyman Will this allow me to use my Spotify account on my phone while my wife uses hers on our Google home? jonzey231 As long as she specifies her Spotify account under her profile, I wouldn't see why not. David Hyman If that's the case it would solve such a first world problem for us! Let's hope that's how it works jonzey231 My brother is adding my Fiancee and I to his GPM family plan right now so we can take advantage of this. Previously, we had a $10/mo GPM sub using a shared gmail account. jonzey231 Will be doing this as soon as I get home from work. dcdttu OMG adorable gay couple in ad because Google wants me to buy 1 of these for every square foot of my house. <3 morteum IS THAT THE PIXEL 2???

Morten Ulv My 6P is over two years old and I have both the battery and the bootloop issue. Luckily, in my Norway, phones (and most electronics) have by law a 5 year "extended warranty" (from the seller, not the manufacturer) to protect consumers from issues like this. NexusPhan You're posting on the wrong article. Also, no your 6P is not over two years old as it wasn't released two years ago. Morten Ulv Guess I fucked that up. I bought it used, and my reciept is from march 2015, so that's why. Maybe the preorder date or an error. benjammin03 What does it do with an unrecognized voice? Does it default to a primary account? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ "Google Home Problems With Multi-User Voice, Google Is Looking Into It" Story to be published in 5... 4... 3... Bill Van I can't wait to see if this multi-user update will work with my twin brother. Our voices are so close that we have always had a tough time trying to figure out who is speaking during many recording. I guess I'll find out later this evening but for now my fingers are crossed..... rslh This would be interesting to know. Google is smart, but not sure if it's THAT smart! I would think assigning different hot words for each user would be ideal, but what do I know. trickytree1984 So why the UK delay? Why can i ask my phone for my agenda from my exchange calendar but not my home? Will my wife still be able to use my GPM subscription? Deeco US only, In the coming months, End of Q4, Rolling out in a couple weeks... We are tired of this shit Google!!! Shai Pal Anyone succeeded in doing this outside of U.S? Morten Ulv One should think that it's language (US vs UK) restricted and not location, though from their wording, it seems to be location based. I want to import one soon, so hopefully I'll be able to use these features and not having to wait. Shai Pal My setup is US english and a US google account.

Google Home will recognize each user’s voice, and deliver customized results accordingly. This is a feature Google Home devotees have been requesting since day one, and Google has finally acquiesced. Google Home is, for the uninitiated, a smart home speaker similar to the Amazon Echo. The two are currently embroiled in a battle for control of the smart home market, although Apple is rumored to be working on its own competitor Amazon Echo vs. Google Home vs. Apple's Competitor Amazon Echo vs. Google Home vs. Apple's Competitor In this article, you'll learn the differences between the Amazon Echo and Google Home. We'll also take a look at what features an Apple speaker may include. Read More . The problem for Apple is the Google Home is getting better all the time. Recognizing Multiple Users By Voice Alone The latest addition to Google Home’s growing skillset is support for multiple users. Starting today, your Google Home speaker can be made to remember six different users, and differentiate them by voice alone. Each user can then customize their Google Home experience to suit them. To make use of support for multiple users you’ll need to do the following. First, make sure you have the latest version of the Google Home app. Then look for the card which says “multi-user is available”. If you don’t see the card, click on the icon in the top-right, and find your Google Home from the list of connected devices. Then, click, “Link your account”. After this it’s just a matter of teaching your Google Home to recognize your voice. To accomplish this you’ll need to repeat the phrases “OK Google” and “Hey Google” several times apiece. A neural network will analyze your voice, and be able to recognize you from then on. A Clear Advantage Over the Competition Support for multiple users is available from today in the U.S., and set to arrive in the UK in the coming months.

MSPU Windows Phone Windows 10 Surface Xbox Enterprise Tip us Settings Text Input: Windows 10 Windows Phone Surface Xbox Enterprise Settings Tip us Forum Text Input: Microsoft and Google reportedly planning on adding a built-in ad blocker to Edge and Chrome 2 by Mehedi Hassan  @mehedih_ Apr 20, 2017 at 22:30 GMT9 hours ago Google was recently rumored to be adding a built-in ad-blocker to its Chrome browser. Google is not the only company that might be adding a built-in ad-blocker to its browser — in fact, Microsoft may also be working on bringing a built-in ad-blocker to Windows 10’s default browser, Microsoft Edge. According to AdAge, Microsoft, Google, Facebook, and a couple of other members of the Coalition for Better Ads are reportedly discussing the idea of the built-in ad-blocker in browsers. The ad-blocker in Microsoft Edge and Google Chrome won’t be the run-of-the-mill ad-blocker where all ads in a web page get blocked. Instead, the “new” ad-blocker will only block ads that possibly violate the Better Ads Standards set by the Coalition for Better Ads. For instance, things like auto-playing video ads with sound, pop-up ads, large sticky ads would get blocked by this new technology. The report claims that the members of the Coalition for Better Ads might release the new blocking mechanism to remove ads that violate the Better Ads Standards by the end of this year. Stu Ingis, counsel to the coalition and attorney at Venable LLP, told AdAge: “The end game here is to remove these types of ads which are undercutting the consumer internet experience. Truthfully, those ads can potentially and seriously undercut the broader internet ecosystem.” The Coalition for Better Ads is still apparently in the process of “drawing up its roadmap” which will apparently be ready in the coming weeks. It is unlikely the new ad-blocking mechanism on Microsoft Edge and Google Chrome will arrive anytime soon — but if the new mechanism succeeds, the internet browsing experience for consumers may improve radically.

Even with multi-user support, Google Home can't create reminders or calendar appointments Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/04/20 1:39pm PDTApr 20, 2017 31 Plus 1 on G+ 20 Share on Facebook 40 Share on Twitter Total Shares91 Google Google Home News Videos Google announced multi-user support for Google Home earlier today, but it's only launching in the US right now. This is finally a chance for Google to rectify things and add all those features Home was lacking at launch, and indeed Google has included a few new features. We're still missing some big ones, though. You still cannot create a reminder or add events to your calendar. After going through the setup process for multi-user, Google Home has access to some of your personal account information. That allows you to ask questions about what's on your calendar, view photos tied to your Google Photos account, and so on. However, writing data to your account appears to be a sticking point. If you try to create a reminder or a calendar appointment, Home tells you it can't do that yet, just like it did before. Hopefully the addition of multi-user support will let Google add these very basic features soon. Seriously, adding something to your calendar has to be one of the most common tasks for a human assistant. It's certainly not impossible to do this stuff, either. Assistant on the phone can create reminders and events just fine. Tags Google google assistant google home video subscribe ...

I'll make millions (of reminders)! Good_Ole_Pinocchio Google can't even handle the basics of their own services here.....SAD! lzdking Make Google Great Again! #MGGA mark555055d Such a disappointment. Google better start ramping up the functions on this thing or it will fail. Also, if they do something stupid like releasing a Google home 2 anytime soon, the shit will fly. LondonLeedsFan I thought about Google Home 2 about 3 days after buying this one and realising it doesn't do so much... I can't help but think it's going to happen. mark555055d Yeah... i could totally see them doing something stupid like making a GH2, with bluetooth pairing capability, improving the mics and speaker, charging $30 more for it, and then giving it an "exclusive" software version that allows reminders and calendar support, all while leaving the GH1 back for months due to "hardware differences". LondonLeedsFan IMO something like this should not be on a 1 or 2 year upgrade cycle. If that's how it goes, I'll leave it! Pete Still no assistant on my Nexus 5X in the UK! LondonLeedsFan Have you set phone language to English US and got latest play services? That will basically push it to your phone within 5 minutes. Pete Latest Play Services (even gone for the beta), same with Google app. As for language, tried that & it didn't work, but why should I? They say it's available in the UK and various other manufacturers (Samsung, OnePlus etc) have made it available on theirs, but Google haven't rolled it out to Nexus devices over here yet. A farce. LondonLeedsFan I have a 6P in the UK and I've had it for about 6 weeks now. Strange. Roderick Gadellaa I don't have it on my Moto X 2014 either and I updated the Google app, Play Services and even edited the build.prop. Somehow it's not working for everyone yet. That said, on the Moto X it may be Moto Voice that's the problem because it also prevents Ok Google hotword detection from anywhere but the Google app itself - it doesn't even work in Google Now On Tap although the searchbar says "Say OK Google". Leonardo Baez create reminder to bitch about you. :,D brian. Careful, she'll turn that insult on you... sbeaulieu The biggest problem assistant got is support. Only one country(officialy). dcdttu Gotta have one before the other, maybe. So that's what they hopefully are going to do next. pfmiller Once you can distinguish between users that's all you should need for both reading and writing appointments. I'm wondering if they are not fully confident in the reliability of the multiple user recognition, so they figure implementing read-only functions is safer while they work on getting the reliability up. denisu So, am I right in saying it can only make calendar disappointments? elchuby Can't even do that. Crystalatracy Managing director of Google!, is explaining to users to start off "Work at home" method, that People have been doing for about one year now. These days alone, I generated close to $36,000 until now with no more than my home computer as well as some spare time, despite that i have a fulltime 9 to 5 job. Even everyone not used to this, can make $89/per h easily and the earnings can go even higher over time...

Artem Russakovskii (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻ Gaurav Arora Please keep the table back where it was senor_heisenberg Goddamn Aaron Berlin I'm sure that's coming. I'm more excited to find out how they intend to handle messaging, though. surethom I'm sorry but why can Google not do the most simplest things. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Because they're a bunch of overpaid prima donnas who think they're geniuses but can't even match what a simple diligent grunt coder can do. M6 Over 90% of those grunt coders you mention probably couldn't write a simple service that serves a 'hello world' webpage at the thousands of QPS that Google's least popular services have to handle. Most of the work done to spin up such a service are done by SREs not SWEs. This is why start ups can add features so quickly. They simply don't have that many users and can worry about scalability after they get popular, and they have months if not years to work out a scalable solution in the meantime. Also, most grunt coders that add features quickly end up accumulating vast amounts of technical debt in the code they write. Morten Ulv Readers of Android Police are highly trained in pitchforking and kneejerk reactions. No critical thought allowed here, get out! abqnm If I hired an assistant and he or she couldn't add appointments to my calendar, I'd fire that motherfucker on the spot. I guess it must be time to get jobs at Google. Because they sure as shit don't know what an assistant is or what they are supposed to be able to do. Morten Ulv I'm sure they are not aware of the problem and that you would totally be fix it in 5 minutes. That's how it is, I'm sure! Lateef Alabi-Oki I'm just glad that the multiuser support works as well as it does. It hasn't failed in distinguishing the voices in my household. My spouse told it to show pictures from Google Photos and it executed. It's truly magical. Forgive my honeymoon phase. I'll be back to bitching in a day or two. makapav The next thing Google needs to enable us family sharing of all pictures and albums instead of doing it one by one. mustbepbs Still can't even add time to an existing fucking timer. Seriously, this company has the weirdest priorities. makapav Stickers FTW! Duder12 Google literally just tackled the biggest hurdle. Its all game over from here on out for the competition. bozzykid Considering you can hardly do anything with the multi-user support, it isn't even clear if it truly works. Martin Still don't get the point of this trash... If it can't make a simple reminder or cal app... What for people use it? Weather? Time? When you are surrounded or 10 more gadgets doing the same (watch, phone, tv, Pc and many more)... This is why I am never too exited when Google releases something new, it's never good, not even close to what they promise it is going to be... :) Matt Terk I have 3 devices, whole home music is wonderful along with all the assistant functions and control of all my smarthome devices. It would be hard to live without it now. boop It's the cheapest cast-enabled speaker I know of and it works fantastically. The voice commands for pulling up music are also best-in-class. I have a few smart home devices as well and virtually any combination of words construable as a command mumbled from anywhere in the room will do what I want. I doesn't do everything it ought to but it does quite a lot and does it exceptionally well. jdrch Google Home: a solution in desperate search of a problem. Deeco AP is the biggest Android media site, please make articles about all the short comings of Google and shame them until we are heard. Too much crap going on itsatrap Why people buy this thing? Morten Ulv Because these small (but important) issues will get ironed out and Google has a much better potential than Amazon at nailing it. JG What about Hangouts?

Google Assistant adds support for Lowes Iris, Lutron Caseta, and Osram Lightify Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/04/18 3:41pm PDTApr 18, 2017 23 Plus 1 on G+ 14 Share on Facebook 41 Share on Twitter Total Shares78 Google News Even if you have a wide array of smart home products from different manufacturers, Google wants to make sure they all work seamlessly on Assistant (and thus, the Google Home). The company has gradually added more supported services since launch, and now Assistant works with Lowes Iris, Lutron Caseta, and Osram Lightify. I've never heard of any of these products before, and maybe you haven't either, so I'll go over what these actually are. Lowes Iris is the store's smart home lineup, comprised of light bulbs, outlets, locks, and thermostats. Iris is already compatible with Amazon Alexa, so it's nice to see some support for the Google Home as well. Next up is Lutron Caseta Wireless, which includes dimmers, remote control shades, and a thermostat. Finally, Osram's Lightify product line includes smart LED lamps and light bulbs. If you have any of these devices, you can now connect them to Assistant through the Google Home app. Source: Google Home Help Tags google assistant google home lowe's lowes iris lutron lutron caseta osram osram lightify smart bulb smart home smart lock smart outlet subscribe ...

I want to see more aggressive IoT support from the Googs. A little piglet dies every time I have to concede the Amazon Echo has more IoT support than Google Home. Even though I think the Home is a better product in general. dcdttu You might mention that most if not all of those devices require a hub to work with Google Assistant. Individual items such as a Litton Caseta light switch won't simply work with Google Home. Itchy_Robot WeMo individual devices work dcdttu You are correct. However, this article isn't about WeMo. It's about Iris (requires a hub), Lutron Caseta (requres a hub) and Osram Lightify (requires a hub) devices. DarenTx I want Hulu support. Alfred Ridiculous. So my Google Home can turn off the lamp for me, but it still can't even play an mp3 I have on my phone or my PC. David Hyman Try all cast or es file Explorers Chromecast player. Both of those options work great for me when I want to cast something. All cast in particular works quite well mlm5em If the song is uploaded to Google play music, can it play from there? Or do you have to actually pay for the GPM subscription plan? (I pay for GPM so I can't test this). surethom If you ask for a song by artist & song title Google home will not play buy assistant on all other android devices will??? You can only request Playlists you have created. Barrie McNaught That is not true, worked for me right now. All that I use song title - artist when searching. surethom I don't subscribe but have 10000 songs uploaded to Google play service & you cannot ask for Google Home to play a song by artist & title but you cannon Mobile l device. Not sure if u have a subscription service? Alfred I have the same experience. I uploaded a bunch of ripped CDs to Google Play Music. Then I ask the Google Home to play it, but it can't. The only option seems to be to create a 'playlist' for every CD and ask it to stream that playlist. Rather disappointing that Google can't make this work. Alfred I just uploaded my CDs, but unless you make playlists for each CD or group of songs you want to stream, the Google Home can not play songs you upload. papastevez Why can't they add support for google play movies???? ITS YOUR OWN PRODUCT (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻ Melissacdonnelly Managing director of Google!, is explaining to users to start off "Work at home" method, that People have been doing for about one year now.

Paito Anderson I just purchased a Wink Hub 2 to get my Lutron Caseta light switches to play nicely with Google Home, I guess I can return that now! tzfardaya I'm still waiting for wemo led lights to be supported... Bill_Surowiecki "Ive never heard of these products, lets talk about them". Ugggg Kids! Ok just kidding, since this is lacking a ton of information, about these products lets add some more. IRIS - This is a smart hub or bridge much like Smartthings. You really should not by this hub, as it seems stupid to pay $20+ for nothing. The IRIS HUB is what is now compatible with the Google Assistant, not the Zigbee peripherals for the hub. Google Home does not support Zigbee by itself, you need the HUB to act as a bridget. Of note those peripherals area compatible with Smartthings and several other Smart Home hubs that support the Zigbee protocol. Lutron Caseta - How on earth have you never heard of Lutron, they have only been making light switches for your entire life. The Caseta platform is a proprietary wireless lighting standard. It also has its own hub that its switches and remotes require to function. This HUB is what connects to the Assistant. Osram Lightify - This is a subdivision of Sylvania, which among other products has been making light bulbs for a long time. The Lightify system is similar to the Philips HUE in that it is a bulb and hub setup. Where it differs from the HUE is in its pricing and the fact that out of the box the bulb can work without the Lightify Hub, so long as you have another Hub that supports the Zigbee Light Link standard such as Smartthings. So if you already have Smartthings you already have control of these bulbs with your Google Assitant, but if you dont you can always buy the Lightify Hub and now Assistant can talk directly to it. alsosavagemike Thank you for the info. alsosavagemike For services like GPMovies and Hulu which don't work directly you can do this little work-around to gain a lot of the functionality. 1. Initiate a stream of what you want to watch from the particular app to a Chromecast. For this example I'll call that device Chromecast device "Screen1". 2. Once it is playing say to Google Home "OK Google, Pause Screen1". Sometimes I have to say this twice but usually not. GHome will pause the stream and also now understands that this is an active stream for it to act on. So any further deck commands - such as Pause, Rewind, Play, Stop, Etc... - will now work without having to name the Screen1 device. It will continue to work until you stop that stream or initiate another stream of some kind with that GHome device. For example if you started playing a radio station on that GHome then deck commands would control that stream. But who does that? I use this method all the time. Not quite as convenient as built in support but gets me 90% of the way there as you can control all playback after initially taking control of the stream.

The iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus, Samsung Galaxy S8, and Galaxy S8+ are four of the best smartphones money can buy. From their excellent cameras, to their speed, to their beautiful displays, these devices have it all. Close to it anyway. These days though it can be hard to tell the iPhone and Galaxy S apart, particularly for those that aren’t plugged into the world of smartphones. While the hardware lines are blurred, there are some key differences that you must consider before you commit to one or the other. Today we want to walk you through some basics to keep in the back of your mind as you try and make up your mind. These tips aren’t aimed at hardcore Android or iOS users. These are focused on those of you that don’t possess any brand loyalty and are simply in the market for the best device, for the right price, to suit your needs. Software Support Software support is one of the key differences between the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus vs. Galaxy S8+ and Galaxy S8: Software support. If you’ve owned, or currently own, an iPhone or Galaxy S you probably know where we’re going with this. Let’s start with Apple and the iPhone. Apple is in complete control of the iOS software that powers the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. Carriers have some input but ultimately it decides what to put on its software updates. It also decides how and when to roll software updates out to its mobile devices. So what does this mean for the end user (you)? It means the iPhone doesn’t have any carrier bloatware. It means you can test beta software ahead of time. It means you get rapid fire iOS updates with bug fixes and security patches. It means your device is constantly updated with new features and tweaks. It also makes predicting when you’ll get your next big software release easy. Apple is predictable in that it announces new software in the summer, releases a beta, and then releases the new iOS update in the fall alongside a new iPhone. All iPhone users get the new iOS software at the same time. You also know that Apple will keep your device supported for a long stretch of time. The iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus are new and should be supported for at least three to four more years before they’re kicked to the curb. Compare this to Samsung. While things have improved over the year, Samsung’s software support still isn’t on par with Apple’s. And this is something to consider if you hate bugs, love getting new software features, and/or plan to keep your device for a long time. Samsung, in some ways, is still at the mercy of Google and its carrier partners. What does this mean for you? It means the Galaxy S8 comes with annoying carrier bloatware. Some can be removed, others can’t and will just sit there taking up space on your screen/internal storage. It means big Android releases for the Galaxy S8 will be unpredictable. Google is planning to announce more Android O details at Google I/O in May ahead of a probable release this fall but it won’t talk about Samsung’s plans for the new operating system. It’ll probably be awhile before you hear anything concrete about the Galaxy S8 Android O update. Samsung’s typically months behind Google’s roll out. Case in point: The Galaxy S7 and Android 7.0 Nougat. Android 7.0 Nougat rolled out to Nexus devices in August. The first Samsung Galaxy S7 Nougat update landed in January. It’s also worth noting that the Galaxy S7 isn’t running Android 7.1.1 (released in late 2016) or Android 7.1.2 Nougat (released by Google in April). It means Galaxy S8 bug fix updates will be sporadic and unpredictable. You could go long stretches without seeing receiving key bug fixers from Samsung and your carrier. Samsung and its partners will roll out monthly security updates but these patches typically don’t come with bug fixes. And then there’s the longevity of Galaxy S devices. With Apple, again, you typically get four years of software support before your device gets cut off. With Samsung, its typically two, three if you’re really lucky. Take the Galaxy S5, Samsung’s most popular device in the United States. It was released in 2014 (same year as the iPhone 6) and it probably won’t get Nougat. And while its still getting bug fix updates and security patches, we expect support to slow as Samsung and carriers focus on more pressing matters (Galaxy S8, Galaxy S7, newer devices). Storage With the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, Apple changed up how it handles storage. They still don’t feature expandable storage but there’s more internal space for photos, videos, and applications. The 64GB iPhone is no more. Instead, Apple and its partners offer 32GB (cheapest), 128GB (same price as 64GB in years past), and 256GB of internal storage. Of course, you don’t actually get 32GB, 128GB or 256GB of storage. Apple’s software requires some space to operate. For instance, on a 32GB iPhone 7, you’ll probably only get 25GB of space with which to work. That won’t be a problem for some people but you’d be surprised how quickly that space can fill up. You’ll also get 5GB of free iCloud storage before you have to start shelling out real cash to Apple for additional space on the cloud. 5GB isn’t much either. Samsung also offers a cloud solution, Samsung Cloud, but it’s not as vital as iCloud. This is because the Galaxy S8 features expandable storage. The Samsung Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ come with 64GB of internal storage. There are not other storage options. This might seem like a problem but it’s not when you consider that you can buy a cheap microSD cards to expand your storage up to 256GB. That’s a mind-boggling amount of space for $20. So this is something to keep in mind as you decide which to buy. If you typically find yourself scrounging for free space on your device, you might take a closer look at the Galaxy S8 and the peace of mind it could deliver. Price The Samsung Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8 are the new guys in town but that doesn’t mean they’re more expensive than the seven month old iPhone 7/iPhone 7 Plus. Samsung’s flagship devices cost about the same at America’s most popular carriers, AT&T and Verizon. AT&T iPhone 7 32GB Monthly: $21.67/mo Full Price: $649.99 iPhone 7 Plus 32GB Monthly: $25.67/mo Full Price: $769.99 Samsung Galaxy S8 Monthly: $25/mo Full Price: $749.99 Samsung Galaxy S8+ Monthly: $28.34/mo Full Price: $849.99 Verizon iPhone 7 32GB Monthly: $27.08/mo Full Price: $649.99 iPhone 7 Plus 32GB Monthly: $32.08/mo Full Price: $769.99 Samsung Galaxy S8 Monthly: $30/mo Full Price: $720 Samsung Galaxy S8+ Monthly: $35/mo Full Price: $840 So what should you take away from these numbers? Both of these phones are expensive. You have to pay up if you want the latest and greatest features. If these prices are too much for your blood, consider the Galaxy S7/Galaxy S7 Edge or the iPhone 6s/iPhone 6s Plus. They’re a year old but they’re still excellent devices. The Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ are actually a little cheaper at Verizon even though the monthly payments are larger. iPhone vs. Android The Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ run Google’s Android 7.0 Nougat with the Samsung Experience (formerly known as TouchWiz) on top. The iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus run Apple’s iOS 10 operating system. More specifically, they run iOS 10.3.1. If you trying to decide between the iPhone 7 or Galaxy S8 you’ll want to get acclimated to both of these operating systems before you buy. All of these phones come with powerful hardware so it’ll be the software, and your comfort level with that software, that helps to separate one device from the rest of the pack. There are also some key differences between iPhone and Android you’ll want to be aware of. For instance, Android doesn’t have a unified messaging experience like Apple’s iMessage service. Read about the differences between iPhone vs. Android but make sure to go hands-on with the software before you make a final decision. Moving from one device/operating system is easier than ever. If you own an Android device you might be thinking about how hard it will be to transfer all of your data over to the iPhone 7 or iPhone. Same goes for you iPhone users. This might seem daunting but don’t let it influence your decision. It’s actually very easy to make the switch. Both Apple and Samsung make it simple to switch from Android to iPhone and vice versa. Samsung offers its Samsung Smart Switch service and Apple has its Move to iOS app that takes you step-by-step through the process. Galaxy S8 Fingerprint Sensor We remember the days when you used to have to enter a PIN or a password to unlock an iPhone or a Galaxy S. These days, smartphones are smart enough to unlock with a fingerprint. The fingerprint sensors on the iPhone 7 (known as Touch ID) and Galaxy S8 are important for security but they also make opening the device and paying for items through Samsung Pay and Apple Pay much more convenient. The iPhone 7’s Touch ID fingerprint sensor isn’t perfect but it’s not considered to be a detriment like the Galaxy S8’s fingerprint sensor. The Samsung Galaxy S8’s sensor is located on the back of the device and its has been widely panned in reviews from around the web. Even Android-centric sites hate it. In our brief experience, its awkward placement can make it hard to unlock with your index finger leading to longer unlock times. Your finger also might gravitate to the camera sensor which is placed right next to the sensor. This isn’t a feature you’ll use once or twice a day. This is a feature you could use 100+ times a day. It’s important. Unfortunately, this isn’t something Samsung can fix with a software update and it’s a change you’ll really want to see for yourself before you commit to one device or the other. 3 Reasons Not to Install Galaxy S7 Nougat & 7 Reasons You Should Install Nougat If You Want Better Security   1 / 10 Let's start with some basics. If you value your security, and most of you probably do, you'll want to think about installing the Galaxy S7 Nougat update soon after it arrives for your device.  Every month, Google and Samsung release important security patches for Android devices. The Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Android Nougat updates should bring the latest security patches to your device. Samsung's initial batch of Galaxy S7 Nougat updates delivered the company's January security update while upcoming updates could deliver the patches from the February security update. You can read more about their contents on Samsung's website.  If you failed to download or receive an older security update (December, November, etc), the patches from those updates might be baked into your version of Nougat. If not, you might be forced to install them manually before you can download Nougat.  On top of the patches, Samsung's Galaxy S7 Nougat update brings Samsung Pass, a way to secure your identity using biometric data rather than entering your password or ID.  Samsung Pass is like a master key for your various logins and it relies on Galaxy S7's fingerprint scanner. The biometric data is encrypted and stored safely by Samsung Knox.   1 / 10 Leave a Reply Cancel Reply Your email address will not be published. Comment Name* Email* Website

But appearances are deceiving. In fact, according to a new report by the London venture capital firm Atomico, European startups are now taking the lead in artificial intelligence, building new tech hubs, and drawing investment from traditional industrial stalwarts. Last year, a record-setting $13.6 billion was invested in Europe’s tech sector, compared with $2.8 billion in 2011. Gone are the days when Europe’s “tech” sector largely comprised consumer-oriented e-commerce businesses – often blatant knockoffs of successful US companies. Today, Europe is the home of real pioneering innovation, led by what Atomico calls “deep tech” – the kind of artificial intelligence developed by Google’s DeepMind. Deep tech accounted for $1.3 billion of European venture investments in 2015, delivered in 82 rounds, up from $289 million, delivered in 55 rounds, in 2011. Europe’s new tech hubs are emerging in unexpected places, far beyond the early hotspots of London, Berlin, and Stockholm. Atomico pinpoints Paris, Munich, Zurich, and Copenhagen as the cities to watch over the coming years. The French capital, Atomico points out, is already starting to challenge London and Berlin in terms of the number and volume of venture-capital-financed deals. Europe’s traditional industries are now awakening to tech. Two-thirds of Europe’s largest corporates by market capitalization have made a direct investment in a tech company. One-third of those companies have acquired a tech company since the beginning of 2015. Foreign firms are also rushing to take advantage of Europe’s tech talent. Google, Facebook, and Amazon have all announced major expansions of their European tech hubs. Transactions worth more than $88 billion took place last year – compared to just $3.3 billion in 2014 – including SoftBank’s purchase of the British semiconductor-design firm ARM and Qualcomm’s $47 billion purchase of NXP Semiconductors. Another study, by the Boston Consulting Group, points out that many small export-oriented European Union member countries – namely, the Benelux, Baltic, and Nordic countries – rank well above the US in so-called “e-intensity,” which covers IT infrastructure, Internet access, as well as businesses, consumer, and government engagement in Internet-related activities. These “digital frontrunners” generate about 8% of their GDP from the Internet, compared to 5% in Europe’s Big Five (Germany, France, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom). Digitization is expected to generate between 1.6 million and 2.3 million more jobs than it eliminates in these countries between 2015 and 2020. Of course, Europe’s tech sector still has its weaknesses, reflected in its failure so far to produce a tech giant to rival the behemoths of Silicon Valley. While European tech entrepreneurs find it as easy as their American counterparts to raise startup funds, US firms enjoy 14 times more later-stage capital. That funding gap would disappear, if European pension funds allocated just 0.6% more of their capital under management to venture investments. A related weakness is the lack of a true European single digital market. In the US or China, tech entrepreneurs gain immediate access to a massive market. In Europe, they still must navigate 28 different consumer markets and regulatory regimes. To be sure, the European Commission promised to create a single digital market two years ago, estimating that it could boost the EU economy by €415 billion ($448.5 billion) annually. But Hosuk Lee-Makiyama and Philippe Legrain of the Open Political Economy Network recently delivered a scathing assessment of the results. Europe’s “single digital market,” they argue, currently amounts “to a jumble of outdated, corporatist, counterproductive industrial policies that favor producers over consumers, big companies over small, traditional incumbents over digital startups, and EU firms over foreign ones.” Instead of liberalizing, the EU wants to regulate. For example, it is working to ban companies from refusing online sales (except for copyright reasons) or setting different prices on the basis of a customer’s home country. Other dangerous possibilities – such as an effort to regulate data ownership, access, and usability – lie on the horizon. Despite these risks, the overall trend in Europe’s tech sector is a positive one. A new appetite for risk seems to be sweeping the continent; Atomico reports that more than 85% of founders say it is “culturally acceptable” to start one’s own company. Add to that deep research talent – five of the top ten global computer science faculties are within the EU – and Europe’s start-up boom looks sustainable. Politically, too, there is reason for optimism. Europe’s digital frontrunners are beginning to organize into a potent force, with 16 small EU countries, from Denmark to Ireland and Estonia, having formed a pro-Internet group. Together, these countries have urged the EU to ban data-localization requirements. At a time when the US is pursuing protectionist, insular, and backward-looking policies, Europe is stepping up as an innovative and forward-looking economic force. Wouldn’t it be ironic if, as now seems likely, it is the supposedly backward EU that ended up leading the way in unlocking the Internet’s true economic potential?

Google's browser will block ads by default: report Friday April 21, 2017 10 Share KeallHauled Chris Keall Play NBR radio on Here's yet another piece of news that makes me glad NBR has a subscription-heavy funding model: Google plans to add an ad-blocking feature to its popular Chrome web browser within weeks – and have it turned on by default, according to a Wall Street Journal report quoting unnamed insiders. Ad blockers are already a bane for those trying to prosper in the cruel landscape of online advertising. According to one report (albeit by a crowd pushing a tool to thwart the technology), nearly a quarter of Kiwis are now using software that blocks many web ads. At the moment, those who want to block ads have to install a web browser extension. That’s actually straightforward but it takes several steps and involves jargon that’s offputting to mainstream users. But Google’s apparent plan is to build web-blocking ability into Chrome, with the user required to turn it off if they don’t want it. That could be a big step in making ad-blocking an everyday thing, as Chrome is now the world’s most popular browser by most measures and it happens to be NBR readers’ favourite too. Here are our visitor stats from the past week: Google Chrome: 38.30% Apple Safari 33.7% Microsoft Internet Explorer: 15.70% Mozilla Firefox: 4.87% Microsoft Edge: 3.32% Others: 4.38% There are no prizes for guessing whether the Chrome ad-blocker will let Google’s own ads through. But which will it block by default? Insiders quoted by the WSJ says details are still being ironed out but the Chrome ad-blocker could “filter out certain online ad types deemed to provide bad experiences for users as they move around the web …  Unacceptable ad types would be those recently defined by the Coalition for Better Ads, an industry group that released a list of ad standards in March. According to those standards, ad formats such as pop-ups, auto-playing video ads with sound and ‘prestitial’ ads with countdown timers are deemed to be “beneath a threshold of consumer acceptability.” Read more from Chris Keall Email Chris: ckeall@nbr.co.nz Follow @@ChrisKeall 10 · Got a question about this story?

It is easy enough to force people who are switched on enough to install an ad blocker to turn it off to visit your webpage; but what about the masses? I think that the way in which Google seem to be doing this makes sense. Block the crappy ads and let the good ones through - I don't mind advertising on websites, but some go so overboard that their sites are almost unusable without ad blockers. Reply Share Share   0 0 #5 by Harry 7 hours ago Might be interesting to note that Firefox has been experimenting with anti-tracking protection (which has the practical effect of blocking ads, as almost all of them track you around the web). It's enabled by default in private browsing, and can be turned on manually for everything else.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Mobile Image Source: Samsung Here’s the real reason Samsung forces you to use Bixby Chris Mills @chrisfmills April 20th, 2017 at 4:47 PM Share Tweet On the new Galaxy S8, Samsung debuted a brand-new intelligent assistant, called Bixby. It’s the same kind of smart AI that we’ve all come to know and love, but it lives in unholy harmony with Google Assistant. Samsung’s said that Bixby is supposed to help you use your phone’s features, rather than be a catch-all digital AI. At least, that’s Samsung’s excuse for having both Bixby and Google Assistant loaded on the Galaxy S8. But Samsung has given Bixby a major leg up over Google Assistant, by dedicating a hardware button the side of the phone to launching Bixby. Samsung has gone out of its way to make sure you can’t remap that button to anything else, which seems like the kind of anti-consumer, locked-down move you’d expect from Apple. Don't Miss: 🦄 Starbucks’ Unicorn Frappucino didn’t kill me 🦄 But here’s the thing: statistically, people don’t care about what digital assistant they have on a phone. A statistically-significant survey from Fluent says that three-quarters of smartphone users don’t care which digital assistant they have on their phone, or if they have one at all. For most people, a digital assistant is just a way to get the weather or set an alarm: the average user don’t come close to using the full capabilities of different assistants, so they can’t really differentiate between them. Given Samsung’s outsized R&D budget, you have to assume that Samsung knows that people don’t have an affinity for Google Assistant over Bixby in the same way that they would for, say, WhatsApp over Samsung’s own messaging app. People just don’t care that you can’t remap the Bixby button to Google Assistant, because they wouldn’t have bothered to do that even if they could. But while consumers might not care which digital AI they use, Samsung sure does. Google’s entire Android business model is built around collecting data and using it to target ads and products; nothing does that better than a digital AI that gets to know you. Samsung has long had ambitions to do more than just make phones. It’s been working on its own mobile OS for years, and a digital assistant is just the next place Samsung will try and do war with Google.

This was made known today by Yury Pinsky, Product Manager Google Assistant in a blog post. This upgrade means multiple users in the US can train their Home hubs to recognize different voices of up to six people. That’s not all, the app now has the ability to keep profiles of every one of them. “Starting today, I can—and so can you. We’re adding the ability for up to six people to connect their account to one Google Home. So now when I ask my Google Assistant for help, it can distinguish my voice from my wife’s and I can hear my own personal playlists, my own commute time, my own schedule and more,” Pinsky said. Getting started is quite easy; first step is to make sure you have the latest version of the Google Home app. Once you have the latest version of the app, look for a card that says “multi-user” is available [of course, this card clearly indicates that you have the very latest version]. However, you can still click on the icon in the top right to see all of your connected devices if the card is not in the top right. There you will find Google Home from the list; select “Link your account.” The real task of teaching the service how to recognize or identify your voice and distinguish it from any other member of the family or friend: “From there, you’ll teach your Assistant to understand it’s you, not your partner, family member or roommate—and vice versa, based on who’s speaking. For certain features, like personalized music and commute, you’ll also need to set up your preferences within the app” Pinsky added. Credit: https://blog.google/products/assistant/tomato-tomahto-google-home-now-supports-multiple-users/ When your account is connected to Google Home, you will be asked to say the phrases “Ok Google” and “Hey Google” twice each. The two phrases will then be analyzed by a neural network that has the ability to detect certain characteristics of a person’s voice. Once the analysis has been successfully completed, Google Home will be able to compare the sound of your voice to its previous analysis anytime you say “Ok Google” or “Hey Google.” The sound of your voice is then compared to the previous analysis so the Assistant can understand the exact person speaking. The comparison, according to Yuri, “takes place only on your device, in a matter of milliseconds.” You can use Home to train your assistant to recognize each of the different voices—and of course, it can start addressing each person found in its records by name. Video Credit: https://blog.google/products/assistant/tomato-tomahto-google-home-now-supports-multiple-users/ The feature has started rolling out to users in the US today; and all things being equal, users in the UK can expect to start using it in the coming months, Google promised. It is a good more, and one that will encourage more people to start using the service. It also places Home in a better position to compete with the likes of Amazon Echo and Apple Siri.

Google accidentally pushed a Dogfood test build of the May 2017 security update to the Pixel XL Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/04/18 4:20pm PDTApr 18, 2017 48 Plus 1 on G+ 119 Share on Facebook 55 Share on Twitter Total Shares222 Applications Google News Google seems to have a problem with keeping testers and customers apart. Last month, the company pushed an unfinished Google Drive for Windows update, causing Drive to break for thousands of users. Now Google has accidentally released a confidential build of the May 2017 security update to normal Pixel XL owners. We've received a few reports of the update so far, and our own Artem has received the update on his Pixel XL as well. As you can see from the below screenshot, this was clearly not meant for public release:   There isn't any user-visible changes in this update, which has a build number of N2G47O. One tipster said he received the new Play Store UI after updating, but that's likely just a server-side change that was flipped by coincidence. Let us know in the comments below if you see it on your phone. Thanks: Everyone who sent this in Tags dogfood Google N2G47O ota security update update subscribe ...

Last month, the company pushed an unfinished Google Drive for Windows update, causing Drive to break for thousands of users." Edit: ..causing Drive to break for tens of users. Corbin Davenport Between all the posts on the Drive Product Forums, Twitter, Reddit, and other sites, there were definitely thousands (myself included). NinoBr0wn That comment definitely wasn't being facetious. But this one is. Trooper311 Nothing showed up for me on my PIxel Xl. I am sure they have fixed the issue by now. derk p :: checks software update:: Nothing showed up for me on my Pixel. I am sure they have fixed the issue by now. Defenestratus There's that vaunted Google QA again. Total Insecurity Google needs to bring their machine learning technology to the next step and help them to differ between testers and customers! mrjayviper doesn't seemed to be a problem with Apple and I doubt they use any AI (or at least to Google's level) on their OTA updates PhantomGamers He was joking... -.- Total Insecurity They have less devices. So it's easier to coordinate the updates for them. mrjayviper Apple supports more devices than Google. That's a fact. Sir_Brizz No compromises device. Knowledgeborn Allah 😂😂😂 stan gurule Same here on my HTC 10. Adam Margeson Same what? stan gurule Whatever dogfood update it was, everyone else was saying "same here" so I had too also. Wasn't serious though... DragoCubed Uh okay 4Ui812 It wasn't an accident it's Google. They been fucking up a lot shit lately. JohnyNoLegs Prob shows that customers are getting beta/alpha/dogfood builds anyway. pks OTA link: https://ota.googlezip.net/packages/ota-api/google_marlin_marlin/6ea1ccda14a13cd03ab763d27fd7047025a53d3f.zip MrJakeK Next can we talk how horrible their beta forum is? Open non-private GooglePlus board where all the comments are random jerks asking for beta on their old broken phones? Google take notes from Motorola, you owned them for a second you should have learned. YuCMi I guess the idea of "being professional" is lost on Google. Karen Fennell I got this as well! https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/329aa615888972a22bb6aed46e9dc9321d2ef29076d01d8cfa5c7cd3f0277b50.png Nathan J "Google seems to have a problem with keeping testers and customers apart." They seem to be taking a page out of Bethesda's book. All of the Fallout and Elder Scrolls games released in the past 15 years have been buggy messes. And like Android, they are usually fixed by a dedicated community of developers. That settles it. Google needs to release Android for the Pip-boy. /s The limited edition Pip-boy can hold a phone, but I don't think any Android phones are small enough. Maybe, just maybe the Xperia Mini line. It seems to have been made with the iPhone 6 in mind. Sadly, it can't charge one and blocks the port. If someone could 3D print, paint, and polish up a good one, I can see an Android phone where the screen goes, a 10,000mAh power pack where the tape deck is, and wires on the inside connecting the two. The official Pip-boy design is too bulky for practicality, but a slimmer design meant for bigger phones, like the S8/+, G6, Pixel XL, iPhone Plus, etc., holding the phone at an angle over the arm, could be very cool. Especially with an interface geared toward one-handed, landscape use. Anonymous Vagrant What's the name of the download speed monitor app seen on the screenshots? iCoerce I have the new play store ui on both my 3T and S7. 3T running 7.1.2 and my S7 still only on 7.0, so that was definitely just a server side switch. jon Glad to know they do that. Jaufder in Granite Bay (Sac) My Pixel XL has gone absolutely batshit since the 7.1.2 upgrade I did last week. I had previously been dealing with battery problems noted on 7.1.1 ( which mysteriously resolved even before I upgraded to 7.1.2). Now, with 7.1.2, my phone app is locking up, audio is cutting out and/or making amazingly loud crackling noises, headphone audio stops working periodically, the phone randomly shuts off, phone calls won't hang up...etc, etc. It's barely useable at this point. saf1927 No issues here. Aufar Ramadhan My Nexus 6 running Android 7.1.1 is perfect! No downgrades, and no bugs! Gonna flash LineageOS before 2018. Sudev Seems they did it on purpose... They're showcasing that they are "internally testing" things before they release it to public. /s Teja Don't know why lately Google has been messing up things. Nexus 6P OTA with major issues causing rollback, Pixel 7.1.2 OTA having fingerprint issues and this one. jonzey231 That was the regular N6, not the 6P. The 6P is the one with early shutdowns and horrid battery life. Lol. Your argument still stands though lol. Teja Yeahh.. Corrected. :) P. Sherman Please remind me again on how Google is still "superior" to Samsung and OnePlus for pulling s--- like this. As if they weren't content enough on disabling fingerprint readers and borking Bluetooth connectivity... Sumeet Gandhi It updated the playstore for me on my Pixel XL. Now it looks pretty neat tough. Zachary Kew-Denniss Not showing on my XL in the UK. RNTMPX "Dogfood"?! What does it mean?! What's the link with a smartphone?! Dirge Dogfood refers to the googlers themselves, essentially. It's dogfood for the googlers. Internal, confidential software or apps that are for googlers only. Todd Yates It comes from the the phrase "to eat your own dog food" which is when a company uses its own products/services within the business. RNTMPX Thanks! Weird! Besnik Rrustemi Got the new Play Store UI Yesterday on my Nexus 6P Dirge Thank God! I can finally sleep at night knowing you got it Besnik Rrustemi Great man !!. Im glad you can sleep now since i didn't know you were watching other people's​ comments day and night without having anything else to do on your useless life but to care for people's business. Sleep well :-* Hasan I got this update on my Pixel XL, should I update to it? Or no jonzey231 That's the bad side about automated OTAs with that dual system partition. It'll probably update on its own and be waiting for you to reboot. DragoCubed That play store update is definitely just a coincidinc SIGTRAP The level of incompetence at Google is getting completely unacceptable Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Google Screwup of the Day. I told you you should run a series called that. JL Dear Corbin Davenport did you read when it says don´t discuss or comment?.... mike shwilly The only mistake they made is they forgot to replace changelog with "Bug fixes and stability improvements". LoadGamePL Considering what is Google doing lately, stock Android and fast updates are slowly turning into a disadvantage... Manjot Singh I got the new play store UI Dirge And this has what to do with the story? Manjot Singh "One tipster said he received the new Play Store UI after updating, but that's likely just a server-side change that was flipped by coincidence" I got it too on my 1+3 abc Damn!

Even with multi-user support, Google Home can't create reminders or calendar appointments Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/04/20 1:39pm PDTApr 20, 2017 31 Plus 1 on G+ 20 Share on Facebook 40 Share on Twitter Total Shares91 Google Google Home News Videos Google announced multi-user support for Google Home earlier today, but it's only launching in the US right now. This is finally a chance for Google to rectify things and add all those features Home was lacking at launch, and indeed Google has included a few new features. We're still missing some big ones, though. You still cannot create a reminder or add events to your calendar. After going through the setup process for multi-user, Google Home has access to some of your personal account information. That allows you to ask questions about what's on your calendar, view photos tied to your Google Photos account, and so on. However, writing data to your account appears to be a sticking point. If you try to create a reminder or a calendar appointment, Home tells you it can't do that yet, just like it did before. Hopefully the addition of multi-user support will let Google add these very basic features soon. Seriously, adding something to your calendar has to be one of the most common tasks for a human assistant. It's certainly not impossible to do this stuff, either. Assistant on the phone can create reminders and events just fine. Tags Google google assistant google home video subscribe ...

I'll make millions (of reminders)! Good_Ole_Pinocchio Google can't even handle the basics of their own services here.....SAD! lzdking Make Google Great Again! #MGGA mark555055d Such a disappointment. Google better start ramping up the functions on this thing or it will fail. Also, if they do something stupid like releasing a Google home 2 anytime soon, the shit will fly. LondonLeedsFan I thought about Google Home 2 about 3 days after buying this one and realising it doesn't do so much... I can't help but think it's going to happen. mark555055d Yeah... i could totally see them doing something stupid like making a GH2, with bluetooth pairing capability, improving the mics and speaker, charging $30 more for it, and then giving it an "exclusive" software version that allows reminders and calendar support, all while leaving the GH1 back for months due to "hardware differences". LondonLeedsFan IMO something like this should not be on a 1 or 2 year upgrade cycle. If that's how it goes, I'll leave it! Pete Still no assistant on my Nexus 5X in the UK! LondonLeedsFan Have you set phone language to English US and got latest play services? That will basically push it to your phone within 5 minutes. Pete Latest Play Services (even gone for the beta), same with Google app. As for language, tried that & it didn't work, but why should I? They say it's available in the UK and various other manufacturers (Samsung, OnePlus etc) have made it available on theirs, but Google haven't rolled it out to Nexus devices over here yet. A farce. LondonLeedsFan I have a 6P in the UK and I've had it for about 6 weeks now. Strange. Roderick Gadellaa I don't have it on my Moto X 2014 either and I updated the Google app, Play Services and even edited the build.prop. Somehow it's not working for everyone yet. That said, on the Moto X it may be Moto Voice that's the problem because it also prevents Ok Google hotword detection from anywhere but the Google app itself - it doesn't even work in Google Now On Tap although the searchbar says "Say OK Google". Leonardo Baez create reminder to bitch about you. :,D brian. Careful, she'll turn that insult on you... sbeaulieu The biggest problem assistant got is support. Only one country(officialy). dcdttu Gotta have one before the other, maybe. So that's what they hopefully are going to do next. pfmiller Once you can distinguish between users that's all you should need for both reading and writing appointments. I'm wondering if they are not fully confident in the reliability of the multiple user recognition, so they figure implementing read-only functions is safer while they work on getting the reliability up. denisu So, am I right in saying it can only make calendar disappointments? elchuby Can't even do that. Crystalatracy Managing director of Google!, is explaining to users to start off "Work at home" method, that People have been doing for about one year now. These days alone, I generated close to $36,000 until now with no more than my home computer as well as some spare time, despite that i have a fulltime 9 to 5 job.

Artem Russakovskii (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻ Gaurav Arora Please keep the table back where it was senor_heisenberg Goddamn Aaron Berlin I'm sure that's coming. I'm more excited to find out how they intend to handle messaging, though. surethom I'm sorry but why can Google not do the most simplest things. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Because they're a bunch of overpaid prima donnas who think they're geniuses but can't even match what a simple diligent grunt coder can do. M6 Over 90% of those grunt coders you mention probably couldn't write a simple service that serves a 'hello world' webpage at the thousands of QPS that Google's least popular services have to handle. Most of the work done to spin up such a service are done by SREs not SWEs. This is why start ups can add features so quickly. They simply don't have that many users and can worry about scalability after they get popular, and they have months if not years to work out a scalable solution in the meantime. Also, most grunt coders that add features quickly end up accumulating vast amounts of technical debt in the code they write. Morten Ulv Readers of Android Police are highly trained in pitchforking and kneejerk reactions. No critical thought allowed here, get out! abqnm If I hired an assistant and he or she couldn't add appointments to my calendar, I'd fire that motherfucker on the spot. I guess it must be time to get jobs at Google. Because they sure as shit don't know what an assistant is or what they are supposed to be able to do. Morten Ulv I'm sure they are not aware of the problem and that you would totally be fix it in 5 minutes. That's how it is, I'm sure! Lateef Alabi-Oki I'm just glad that the multiuser support works as well as it does. It hasn't failed in distinguishing the voices in my household. My spouse told it to show pictures from Google Photos and it executed. It's truly magical. Forgive my honeymoon phase. I'll be back to bitching in a day or two. makapav The next thing Google needs to enable us family sharing of all pictures and albums instead of doing it one by one. mustbepbs Still can't even add time to an existing fucking timer. Seriously, this company has the weirdest priorities. makapav Stickers FTW! Duder12 Google literally just tackled the biggest hurdle. Its all game over from here on out for the competition. bozzykid Considering you can hardly do anything with the multi-user support, it isn't even clear if it truly works. Martin Still don't get the point of this trash... If it can't make a simple reminder or cal app... What for people use it? Weather? Time? When you are surrounded or 10 more gadgets doing the same (watch, phone, tv, Pc and many more)... This is why I am never too exited when Google releases something new, it's never good, not even close to what they promise it is going to be... :) Matt Terk I have 3 devices, whole home music is wonderful along with all the assistant functions and control of all my smarthome devices. It would be hard to live without it now. boop It's the cheapest cast-enabled speaker I know of and it works fantastically. The voice commands for pulling up music are also best-in-class. I have a few smart home devices as well and virtually any combination of words construable as a command mumbled from anywhere in the room will do what I want. I doesn't do everything it ought to but it does quite a lot and does it exceptionally well. jdrch Google Home: a solution in desperate search of a problem. Deeco AP is the biggest Android media site, please make articles about all the short comings of Google and shame them until we are heard. Too much crap going on itsatrap Why people buy this thing? Morten Ulv Because these small (but important) issues will get ironed out and Google has a much better potential than Amazon at nailing it. JG What about Hangouts?

(Screenshot/Google) Share Written by Dave Gershgorn April 20, 2017 Google and its sister company, Verily, are taking a classic medical research study design and giving it a Silicon Valley spin. The companies, along with researchers from Duke and Stanford universities, will monitor the health of 10,000 people for four years each, using a battery of gadgets and health tests, like wearables, blood tests, x-rays, and genome mapping. In medical research, this is called a longitudinal cohort study: Get a bunch of people from different walks of life, and follow them around for a long time to see which subjects develop the ailment you’re looking for. Then, go back over the data and see if you can pick out any patterns that suggest a potential cause for the disease. What sets the Google study, called Project Baseline, apart, is that it’s not looking for a specific ailment, like cancer development in older adults or developmental disorders in children—it wants to build a comprehensive, data-driven profile of human health. The test won’t take place all at once, according to MIT Tech Review, which reports that patients will be brought in on a rolling basis, the entire project taking up to 10 years. Each person in the study will wear a health-tracking smartwatch every day, slip a sleep-tracking device under their mattress, and set up a hub in their home to send the encrypted data back to researchers. Notably, the smartwatch is not approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for use as a medical device, but is legal as a “investigational device,” meaning it won’t give the participant health data, just sends it back to Google. The FDA status of the sleep-tracking device is unclear, since the Project Baseline site doesn’t say exactly what it is or does; Google, Alphabet, nor Verily have any FDA approved devices according to the regulatory agency’s website. They’ll also have up to four in-person appointments per year, at a Baseline study site. During one comprehensive yearly appointment, researchers will assess physical strength, take x-rays and heart scans, ask questions about health and lifestyle, and sample blood, saliva, stool, and tears. Researchers will call interesting or anomalous participants in to be questioned further up to three more times per year, or after major life events. In addition to all that, participants will have to fill out additional surveys online every three months, and answer other questions via the study’s mobile app. In other words, it will be a slight lifestyle change. Verily, Alphabet’s life science company with an interest in “making the world’s health data useful,” would presumably use this data for its own pursuits, as would the Stanford and Duke medical centers. “Most of what we see as treating physicians are snapshots in time after people are already ill,” writes Sanjiv Sam Gambhir, Stanford professor and researcher on the project, on the Project Baseline website. “By focusing on health and wellness, we can have a meaningful impact on the well-being of patients around the world.” The study will also give Google vast troves of medical data to do…well, we really don’t know. It has the ability to give or sell the data to pretty much anyone, per the study’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. For it’s part, Google has expressed vague interest in contact lenses that monitor biological data, and not dying (a stated interest of the Calico company). Last but not least, Verily has the rights to sell the data to third parties after names, addresses, and phone numbers are scrubbed, MIT Tech review reports, and patients won’t get any comprehensive analysis of their own data. It’s unknown whether this is enough to keep companies from re-identifying participants from that data.

Stuck Pixel: How Google is dropping the ball with its "consumer" phone strategy (opinion) Trevor Newman View All Posts 2017/04/10 12:08pm PDTApr 10, 2017 75 Plus 1 on G+ 145 Share on Facebook 66 Share on Twitter Total Shares286 Editorials News Pixel Pixel XL Videos I admit it. I am a Google fanboy. It’s not that I love Google at the exclusion of any other company. I appreciate the merits of Apple’s business model as well as the thoughtful design of Microsoft's Surface devices. However, there’s something about that #4885ed Google Blue that spices up my life more so than #3b5998 Facebook Blue could ever do. Is it bias? Considering I am legally color blind, the answer is an affirmative yes. However, this bias has not blinded me to the fundamental difference between a company like Google and one like Apple. At Apple, the customer - the revenue generator - is you and me, the consumer. Though many of their decisions may be viewed as anti-consumer (e.g. the #donglelife), much can be said about their comparatively strong customer service as well as the fact that a part of the “Apple Tax” for their products goes toward the maintenance of brick and mortar facilities to which you can bring a broken device and receive a repair or replacement on the spot. On the other hand we have Google, and Google has customers, too. But those customers are neither you nor me. Google’s lifeblood is advertising, and the essential nutrient for ads is data - our data. We the consumers are not Google’s customers. Rather, we are batteries that power Google’s cash advertising engine. While this information is probably not new to most of you, nor is it to me, it helps to explain why Google can't successfully sell a product to save its life (which, at the moment, it has no need to do). Google’s inability to make a successful play in the consumer space is no more apparent than with the Pixel. Google’s first attempt at a “true” Google Phone (R.I.P Nexus) has been a success, but one with reservations. The Pixel is a solid phone. So is the OnePlus 3T. Sure the OP3T lacks the Pixel’s camera, but it is otherwise decent and happens to cost $400 less than a comparable Pixel XL - and is generally available for purchase, which the Pixel most certainly is not. Let’s also just pause for a minute to acknowledge the tone-deaf hubris of charging $30 for a poorly-made clear plastic case. Sure Apple charges Pixel prices, but if my iPhone is defective I can go to an Apple Store, get a replacement on the spot, and have some peace of mind that the extra expense went to maintaining this store and the general customer service model. With Google, the extra cost goes to the bottom line and maybe a month-long replacement process of ‘ship and pray’ with buggy refurbished replacements and full-price holds on my credit card. In my mind, the Nexus program was much truer to Google's “essence.” Nexus users, of which I was one, were willing batteries, providing our data, input, and patience to Google with the promise of reasonably priced hardware, decent specifications, a clean Android experience, and quick updates in return. Granted, despite the aforementioned caveats and the niche market, some of the shortfalls of the Nexus program were simply unacceptable by any standard for a product marketed and sold to consumers. Now we have the Pixel poseur masquerading as the poster child for a Google that cares about the consumer. While the software experience has been generally solid and bugs are being more regularly acknowledged and addressed, the high price, lack of new stock, and sorry replacement process show the pig under the lipstick. Google is still using us to acquire data on product demand and how much people value - in cash - a clean Android experience and quick updates. Once they have our data, we consumers are left holding the bag with a bitter taste in our mouths. Before I get too far down this rabbit hole I must remind myself that I am not the customer, and that I still admire Google for its pie in the sky curiosity and drive to experiment like the Bell Labs of old. So why as a consumer do I continue to throw my money at a lover who could care less? Because I am a fanboy and because, I guess, being Google Blue is better than being some other kind of blue.

Indian Yes we guessed him to be the new man by reading his name, Trevor "Newman" Marcie Mtz Good article...But it's "couldn't care less". chromaniac I have owned the Nexus One, Galaxy Nexus, Nexus S, Nexus 5 and the Nexus 7. I am currently using the Nexus 6P. And I am now waiting for Nokia 9 to replace the Nexus. I never considered getting the Pixel and I am not looking forward to Pixel 2. Google can continue targeting the iPhone user base. I am out. 2×4 oneplus is the new nexus chromaniac Yup. Would have bought the 3T already if Nokia had not arrived on the scene. I recommend 3T to anyone looking for a great phone at reasonable price. Might end up getting the 3T or 4 (when it launches) if Nokia fails to impress. Suicide_Note http://gifsec.com/wp-content/uploads/GIF/2014/08/Funny-laugh-laughing-no-no-way-Not-ok-GIF.gif Corbin Davenport Except when it comes to updates. http://www.androidpolice.com/2017/04/07/oneplus-silent-nougat-oneplus-2-oneplus-x-owners-pissed/ 2×4 OnePlus X can't get Nougat -- it runs a msm8974 OnePlus 2 could. still a better track record than most other OEMs Kevin Sauer Why though? Is it the price? FWIW I can't think of a phone I've loved more than the Pixel and I've tried more than a few, including the 6P. chromaniac Price is of course the biggest issue. Since the launch Google has a permanent 10-15% cashback offer through one route or the other. Even after that most variants are still pricier than S7 Edge. I cannot justify spending this much money on a phone. Devices like 3T are selling for half the price so it would make it even harder to sell it the next year at even 30% of the original cost. Not for me. I have no complaints though. I am no longer the target market for Google and it's perfectly OK. Competition is getting better and better. OnePlus has not sorted out software updates properly. Nokia just might fix that issue as well. Plus they have a history of coming out with phones with brilliant cameras so that part could also be solved with a high end Nokia device. Gotta love Android. Nexus was great. I do not really have to go for Pixel as excellent alternatives exist today. TheCarlosFontes Agreed. I still can't get over my Pixel XL experience. I bought the phone, didn't add insurance, and then found out I couldn't add insurance afterwards. I was never advised! I return my Pixel XL (Really Blue) to Google and when I go to order it again WITH insurance.. it's sold out. Now, who knows how long before it's back in stock. And what happens to the phone I bought? It was in perfect condition, in a case, for maybe 3 days. I can't imagine Google is just going to take that kind of loss on a phone. Are they selling refurbished devices as new? Jay Pixel sold out. Pixel XL 128GB sits in never-ending backorder land. It's been over 6 fucking months, Google. Get your and your partner's shit together​. K thanks.. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Have you seen all the comments (on this and other web sites) about people who are on their 3rd or 4th Pixel? Replacing bad phones takes priority over making new ones, I guess. So you'll just have to wait. Which makes me wonder about how many of those 2 million shipped since launch are just replacements... Jay I have just now, yes. I actually returned my Pixel XL due to constant bootlooping. 😕 I've wanted to go back to it but I'm sad to say that this wait to buy another has gotten tiring... and old. Very old. That, and the price staying the same after 6 months is now becoming a deterrent. TechGuy22 google never does anything right it's nothing new. Brad Well, they did Gmail right in my book. It's why I use it over all the other options out there. Jalal Welcome aboard, Trevor :) Aaqib Ismail It's almost like having to wait for an invite to buy the phone! That might be an exaggeration, but the fact of the matter is that Google is terrible at offering a phone which is not out of stock or back ordered for months. Have they learned nothing from the Nexus days? It's not even like they don't have the capital to produce enough phones to keep a constant supply JTio I don't get this article. I finished reading it and didn't really understand how Google is dropping the ball. Synacks Don't worry, I'll sum it up for everyone. 1. Massive price 2. Terrible design 3. Huge bezels (see #2) 4. Terrible screen 5. No wireless charging 6. No water resistance 7. Super effing huge phone with awful screen to body ratio (see #2 again) It's a fast phone, and it gets updates very quickly. But that's where it stops. ZettabyteGamer 1. Agreed 2. I think it's a beautiful phone, and so do many others 3. Agreed 4. How? It seems pretty great to me 5. Not that big of a deal, Apple doesn't either 6. Not a big issue either, the phone has been tested to function under water for over an hour Synacks 2. If they modified the bezels to fit better, then definitely yes. 4. Screen is just no bueno when compared to Samsung/Apple 5. Not a game changer, but a pretty common feature these days. 6. I'd prefer if it was listed as a spec so I don't get denied warranty. If I brought my S7E in for a warranty issue after water damage, they would replace it if the water strip wasn't pink. Not so sure Google would do the same. Jdban Isn't it a samsung screen though? JTio Yes Synacks A bit of Googling says that it's the same Samsung panel that HTC put in their A9 model which is basically the identically designed phone to the Pixel (but came out before the Pixel). JTio first of all huge difference of internals from the A9 to the Pixel. 2nd - are you even a pixel owner? And if you are, why haven't you sold yours yet and moved on? Synacks I have: 1. Personal S7 Edge & iPhone5S 2. Work Pixel & iPhone 6 S7E will be replaced with S8 in 11 days. 4Ui812 I'd wait for a price drop or the S9. Really no point in upgrading. The S7E is a solid phone. Synacks Unfortunately the S7's are plagued with bad silicon lottery. It's a known issue for them to end up slow and much less responsive after 6 months. Mine isn't as bad as some people have claimed but I do notice it. I could either pay $200 for a replacement unit or I can pay $60 (tax) to upgrade to the S8. I am just going to get the S8 and hope that they fixed that problem seen on the S7 line. I'd like my phone to be snappy for at least a year. 4Ui812 I've had mine since launch. The only issues I've had was a freeze up or 2. But that's it. Speeds been fine CF542 6 months? I replaced my S7E three times in four months for chronic and various problems before giving up and going Pixel blueman24 "Right, if I bought a OnePlus phone at $300 I wouldn't ever complain if it didn't have wireless charging or water resistance. But in a $700 phone.... YES." "I have: 1. Personal S7 Edge" "Unfortunately the S7's are plagued with bad silicon lottery. It's a known issue for them to end up slow and much less responsive after 6 months." You brought a $700 S7edge and not a $300 oneplus, so it should not be acceptable for it to become less responsive after 6 months? Daniel Orchard Except for the snap821 which is the reason it works pretty well... VAVAMk_2 It is a Samsung panel. HTC's role is purely as a manufacturer like FoxConn is for Apple iPhone. Synacks I'm not sure what HTC put in the first version of the Pixel. But looks like LG screen could be in the second. ZettabyteGamer I'm pretty positive the Pixel has a Samsung panel. madmax0609 It is a Samsung screen, but Samsung wouldn't be stupid enough to sell Google their best amoled screens... Those they keep for themselves. Joshua The Pixel has a top of the line Samsung display in it.. now you're just making shit up. Synacks Just because the display has a Samsung logo on it doesn't mean it's top of the line. The S7 screens are noticeably better. When you see a Chevy Cruze, do you automatically think that it has a top of the line Corvette motor in it? Samsung doesn't make just one display.... Joshua Google it. The model number of the pixel display was one of the top displays Samsung made during the time. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman They're merely tuned differently. Did you even try switching it from CMYK to RGB? Some people prefer one over the other. Bryan Breguet And badly calibrated so it looks like shit. Unless you are blind. madmax0609 Google made that phone look like an iPhone on purpose. Humans are visual creatures... if a product looks like an iPhone, and has the price tag of an iPhone, then it must be as good or better than an iPhone. Therefore, people will buy. Very smart advertising on Google's part. WARLORD VIII On the up side the Pixel isn't catching on fire 😎 das I thought that was a feature for survivalists. :P Eric Works for me. The most stable software wise of any phone I've ever used. Paid 300 for mine and prefer it over the s7. Curved screens don't like screen protector. Nothing like water resistant on a phone that looks like a cat danced on it. Another huge plus is the lack of carrier spam. I'm not getting all the complaints. Google showed us we'd be getting if we choose to buy it. I for one have no regrets about doing so. J.J. Yes the things it lacks are not a big deal but when you can get a different phone for same or less price with said features it deminishes it's value. Synacks Right, if I bought a OnePlus phone at $300 I wouldn't ever complain if it didn't have wireless charging or water resistance. But in a $700 phone.... YES. Kristian Ivanov I'm not going to comment on the actual design, I want to hear thoughts comparing it to the undesputed legend - Nexus 5 (design only) JTio 1. Debatable 2-4. Disagree 5. Who cares 6. Would be nice but it's not Google dropping the ball Why did you put #7? Synacks See edited version. basically a placeholder JTio Got it. add 7 to 2-4 for me. I totally disagree with this. Plus it doesn't really relate to the article Christopher Bement #8. Unavailable for purchase destinyhud but this article dont even talk about any of it u posted. its about customer service Mix 8. Sell as lake front property! Drakenoid 9. Profit Matt Pretty sure 2-7 were not mentioned in the article. Max Terrible design and terrible screen? You need new glasses... All the others I can agree on different degrees... Synacks Sorry I was just comparing them to other phones in the same price range. All of them having better design and displays. If the Pixel was sitting in its technically suitable price rance where the Nexus's were ($350/450), both things would be acceptable. Max The only existing phone with undoubtedly "better design and display" would be the S7 edge, and now S8 (which tbf should be compared with Pixel 2 in 2017). All others are basically on similar level or below. But the S7e/S8 suffer from other disadvantages so they aren't perfect either. Synacks I really hope Pixel 2 will be the best phone ever. CF542 The only thing that the S7/S8 truly suffer from is having Samsung as a parent. They turned the phone (s) into a piece of bloatware full of crappy software that nobody wants. Christopher Bement You missed the part where it's near impossible to buy. None of the other shit really matters? Roy 1. New brand new tactic. 2. First generation made in 9 months.. 3. First generation made in 9 months. 4. Not really. 5. First generation made in 9 months. 6. First generation made in 9 months. 7. First generation made in 9 months. Still the best camera and the best software. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman 1. You mean comparable to all other flagships. 2. At worst it's an uninspired design, but not remotely terrible. 3. Meh. They're not great, but not actually *huge*. 4. Not remotely accurate. Fantastic screen. 5. Disappointing, but literally only one other flagship regularly has this and overall nobody but a few of us seem to really care. 6. Also disappointing, but somehow didn't hurt anybody else for years. 7. Nah. Not huge at all, and the ratio's merely not as great as we'd like. ike3232 LIST OF NUMBERS! Ryan Forgot the state of Google's Android, which is nowhere near reliable​ enough to be charging top dollar for AND selling your info. Daniël Franke If that's the truth, then neither is iOS, they both suck in different ways. I recently received an iPhone from work and I consider it quite unpleasant to work with compared to my OnePlus 3t. The notifications are horrible, the settings are difficult to reach. The keyboard is just annoying. Ryan Those are usability preferences. I will agree the settings are a freaking nightmare to find, but I dont go into settings often. Right now, and for over a year now, bluetooth audio has been straight-up broken. They implemented that absoloute volume BS without coding how to handle devices that dont send volume information, breaking it in my car. Then the idiots put developer setting that is to allow you to disable it but they didnt even test it and the user doesnt have permissions to change that setting, so the switch does nothing. That is a BIG bug, and one that Google has refused to address for over a year. Then there is the fact that my phone, and the first Nexus phone I have had to deal with this on, has to be rebooted every few weeks because it slows down horribly. Jack Smith Based on what? Had every iPhone since the 3G and relatively recently added Android as carry both and Android is excellent. So much is written is just simply not true. Suggest actually give recent Android a try and you might be surprised ;). Ryan Ive had android for coming up on 8 years, HTC Hero was the first, then one more HTC before going Nexus. Been on Nexus and still am with my 5x. I know, personally, some of the MAJOR shortcomings of Googles implementation of Android. Notpoliticalyet Mate 9 solves most of those issues EcE I guess by this sentence: "I must remind myself that I am not the customer"? JTio Nailed it except if you buy this phone...then you are the customer EcE I 100% agree. I don't care if I am not their "main customer". If I'm paying you iPhone prices, I should at least receive decent customer care. FAR from the case. JTio Sorry you haven't received good support. I have had great support so far. Even had to replace my original. EcE Not just the customer support, the quality of the devices (everything, pixel, home, whatever the wifi is called), they are plagued with issues. These are not subsidized devices anymore. JTio I guess I have been lucky. I have two Onhubs. Have had no issues so far. Nope.jpeg It's raising the price, but not providing the quality that Apple does at the same. jonzey231 I was wondering who Trevor was...you basically speak for most of us. Haha. We hate Google but we just keep investing our time and resources in them...because Google lol. Welcome aboard! Suicide_Note I don't hate Google, and i use their products because i genuinely like them and the company. Of course, they're not perfect, but no company is, not to mention the majority of their products are FREE. Trevor Newman Thanks @jonzey231:disqus!. Been an avid follower of the site since '11 and happy to be contributing. turbooo Not really adding thing new to the conversation here... Jordan Palmer Welcome to fun, Trevor. HSidhu Hey explain us abt their messaging mess some day... Mr Google fan boy. Trevor Newman In process. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ "Google’s first attempt at a “true” Google Phone (R.I.P Nexus) has been a success" Not sure how you're measuring success. The Pixel has been plagued with problems, one of which cannot be fixed (halos in pictures). And 6 months after release, HTC has still only shipped about 2 million. That's pathetic compared to the competition. Trevor Newman "...but one with reservations." Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Halos in pictures, crackling speakers, bluetooth turning off at random, microphones not working, random switching to speakerphone, shutting down at 30%-40% battery, boot loops, pathetic sales, all for the low low price of $869 for the Pixel Xl 128. And that's not to mention missing features like wireless charging, microSD... Those are a sheet load of reservations. skillfulshoe Well, I got mine for tree fiddy bringing it to t-mobile. So I'd say it wasn't a bad choice. Mix I am on my 3rd 128GB Pixel XL. 'When' it works it is a great phone.... whispy_snippet You've collected a bunch of disparate, isolated complaints and then implied they affect every Pixel. They don't. ScratchC The problem with the Internet is how do I know you actually own one? Or are you just a troll. In any case, I unfortunately had to pass on the Pixel my S6 shit the bed and I had just upgraded to the S7. My gf tho.. I somehow convinced her to grab a Pixel on Verizon. She has not had not 1 issue. I'm not saying they don't exist. It's just not as bad as commenters trying to win an argument make it seem. whispy_snippet Halos in pictures. For goodness sake. I think I've seen this happen once, maybe twice, since buying it at launch. And I take a LOT of photos. If this is the biggest issue you can find in the Pixel it speaks volumes for the quality of the product. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Phandroid did an LG G6 vs. Pixel photo comparison. 4 out of the 22 Pixel photos had halos. None of the LG G6 photos had halos. whispy_snippet Wow. wicketr If Google wants to compete against other Android manufacturers, they've got to figure out their manufacturing problems. It's a disgrace it's taking them numerous years to figure this out. Secondly, if they want to ever compete with Apple, they're going to need to either match their retail stores so that a "genius bar" can fix problems/replace devices on the spot. That of course costs money, but Apple is doing, so should Google. Otherwise Google is just pocketing that money and calling us fools. They're already making a ton off the data they sell, so the devices should be subsidized. Why on Earth do they cost as much as an Apple and Samsung device when they're already selling our data and they have no retail space to help consumers out. They're completely mismanaged and meanwhile we're eating up the crap their giving us. Suicide_Note While i agree with much of what you said, there's no reason at all that Google's devices should be subsidized. That's insane. wicketr Ok, then they shouldn't be selling our data. That's insane. Apple is not selling user's data. Why should Google do it and why should we accept it if that's not being trickled down to the buyers of their devices? I'm not talking about fully subsidizing the device. I'm talking about $50-100 or something. Suicide_Note I think you're forgetting that Gmail, Inbox, Photos, Drive, Docs, Sheets, and on and on are all free to use. That's what you get in exchange for Google selling your data. Apple doesn't do it because they're a different company than Google. Apple has been about hardware since day one, whereas Google was about advertising, and only fairly recently got into the hardware game. AD1980 What? Paying Apple prices without the support and when they're also selling your data is what's insane. Jimk4003 Obviously, you're entitled to your opinion, but why not enjoy having an opinion based on facts, rather than misinformation? Google doesn't sell your data: https://privacy.google.com/intl/en-GB/how-ads-work.html Suicide_Note Right. So they should forever give away or charge cost for their phones? That's not a good long term business model. Adeel Ejaz I think this has been the case with pretty much everything​Google has done. They still work like a start-up and notorious for killing projects that don't stick. And I mean "stick" at Google's scale. Wave, Picasa, Voice, Talk, Reader, all these products were built as a start-up, and got killed like one. But like a fanboy, I do believe there will be brick about mortar stores, and eventually the pre-orders will disappear as well. But all this will take some time but Google will turn it's model much like as Apple's; there is no other option. Suicide_Note Voice is still around and isn't in danger of being killed any time soon. skillfulshoe Gmail was built as a start-up experiment. My point is, Google has a lot of projects that they do not kill and become something great. For example, the technology behind the camera in Google Glass ended up going into the phones as HDR+ and now is responsible for the Pixel's great camera. Suicide_Note Reports claim that the reason behind the lack of supply of Pixel phones is due to supply issues with the AMOLED screens they use. Apparently Google can't secure enough of them to fulfill what demand there is for the Pixel. It would seem Google woefully underestimated the demand for the Pixel, and didn't properly plan ahead to make sure there wouldn't be supply issues after the initial product run. skillfulshoe And that's why Google is investing almost $1billion in LG's display factories IIRC. http://www.reuters.com/article/us-google-lg-display-idUSKBN17C00M Andrew Gallagher Billion, not trillion skillfulshoe Oops, my mistake. Fixed. Suicide_Note https://media.giphy.com/media/13B1WmJg7HwjGU/giphy.gif MadMartigan Okay. So that explains the Pixel. Sadly, that's just the latest in a long list of woefully executed products. Nick V They only shipped 2.5 million phones. With all the advertising, you are saying they weren't expecting to ship that many? Most of the worst ship that in a year Sammy Phillips "Dead Pixel" is a headline just begging to be written. catalysto Or "Stuck Pixel". Sammy Phillips Given Google proclivity for killing products, "Dead Pixel" is latent gold. QuantumFoam Probably different country, but how do you not go with "Pixel Sticks"? Stefan van Manen Where Google messed up in my opinion is at the basics: price (too expensive for the non cutting-edge hardware) and availability (Im not even able to buy it on contract at the 4 big networks here in Holland). 2×4 he's newman give him a break! EcE Helloooooo Newwwman https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2aefe2a4891db81811a1be9e7044f178d36f24a3fc310d6674ccf60af1a0cab6.gif MJ I am not sure it's fair to compare a company (Apple) that has been in hardware day one while Google is fairly new to the game. Google started as and is an Internet company at heart and I am not sure how else you make money except via ads. George Messaging apps... you make money with messaging apps... how else were they gonna sell those stickers? mattcoz And if one messaging app doesn't make enough money, just make another, and another, and... EcE and... MOAR STICKERS!! EcE It is fair when they are trying to compete with such company in every aspect, including prices. Google shouldn't get a pass, almost every single piece of hardware they have released (Nexus included) has been plagued with issues. They've been messing around with hardware since 2010 (unless there was something before the Nexus One). As far as I know the OP 3T has less issues than the Pixel at half the price. skillfulshoe Increase in cost gets you increase in criticism. The Pixels should have not had these problems, but stuff like this is not new to Google. The Nexus phones always had issues but was underplayed by, "But it is half the cost of flagship phones." Hopefully the Pixel 2 will be more thought out and have less issues. MJ Plagued with issues? I have owned three Nexus devices and now a Pixel XL with no major issues. Google hasn't designed a phone yet beyond "these are featured we like" to an OEM. The next Pixel will be totally designed by Google. That's why the OEM name has been on the Nexus phones and NOT Google's name. EcE Nexus 5, no mention of LG, 6p no mention of guaguei, pixel, no mention of htc. The fact that you have not had any issues does not mean there aren't any. (half related) I had 3 LG G3s and 2 G4s (upgraded) before I got one I could sell "as is". There have been boot loop deniers all over the place and now there is a class action suit. Not because those people were lucky, the rest of us didn't have any issues. I had issues with a Nexus One a Nexus 4 and a Nexus 5. The first two were replaced a couple of times by my carrier. I don't own a Pixel but I've read about all the issues. Paul_Werner lol @ guaguei MJ "Nexus 5, no mention of LG, 6p no mention of guaguei, pixel, no mention of htc." What? The Nexus 5 had LG stamped on the back and the 6P had Huawei on it's back. LOL I owned both so please Google images of them. The Pixel XL does not say HTC but I did say the OEM name was on the Nexus phones. The fact is Google didn't do anymore more with the Pixel but take over the branding. Again, this will change with the next Pixel as Google will actually design the phone. I didn't say they have had no issues at all. EcE True, both were at the bottom, my bad. I completely forgot about the 5 (had a red one) and the first images that appear are of the black one. Still, why should they get a pass and not be compared to Apple when they are purposely placing the Pixels against the iPhone? MJ I didn't say they can't be compared but questioned if it was fair (at this point). EcE I still think it is fair. Otherwise, they should have released the Pixel as a Nexus and let the Pixel 2 be their true flagship. Will then be fair to compare them to Apple? Christopher Bement Battery life isn't an issue? I've owned 3 Nexus devices and now a Samsung S series, and each of the Nexuses would barely last a day, while my S7 Edge will last for two. Hell, aside from Doze, the Nexus 6 had built in CPU throttling at something like 50% battery which crippled the phone. And it still died before leaving work. I get that they like to push their charging technology, but you should be able to take the phone away from an outlet for a whole day, that's a safety issue. MJ I have always gotten a day most the time with my Nexus phones (did NOT has a N6) and now usually two days with my Pixel XL. Yes, I am on the lower end of usage which is by far the biggest factor on one's battery life. Your Edge S7 with a SD820 got better battery life? Shocker! That chipset rocks which is what my Pixel XL has... Safety issue? Christopher Bement Safety issue: Not being able to call for help because phone died. That's all really. Vega007 My Pixel is, by far, the best phone I have ever had for battery life. Christopher Bement I'm only going with devices I've actually used, I haven't touched a Pixel personally. All I can say is it's day and night between the N6 and S7 on a given work day where I'm calling, texting and emailing almost constantly. Vega007 That's a good point, it all depends on what phone we have used to compare it to. I have never used a S7 Edge, but I have used a S7. While the battery life was fine, the Pixel does do better for my usage (I'm using the 5" btw). And that's the real key to battery issue is personal use. We all use our devices differently so battery life will always be subjective. T4rd I agree, which is why Google has no business charging the same premium Apple does for hardware they can't supply or support nearly as well as Apple. MJ That's a fair argument as I felt the Pixel were over priced myself but still bought the XL because prefer stock Android at the end of day. Still... I am not interested in Apple phones at all so would compare Google to other Android OEMs. ddevito I agree, but if that's true then you can't charge iPhone prices. Otherwise the market will respond. Every. Single. Time. Zsolt V Yes, they can. At some point the Galaxy S line actually overtook iPhone sales. I honestly feel that if it weren't for the Note 7 debacle, Apple would be in serious trouble this year, even with the mythical iPhone 8 savior. You can only ride the hype on name recognition for so long with an inferior product. ddevito Your Android fanboyism is showing. I'm not a big Cupertino fan but you can't honestly say the iPhone is in trouble. Zsolt V I didn't. ScratchC The iPhone has been in trouble for some time. It's why it started playing catch up (Forget current sales up to now. Poll after poll, iPhone users are bored of iPhones) Actually Google's Android is in trouble as well. Samsung is doing their own thing. Google needs to put it's foot down or compete. The Pixel is an attempt to do so. It's not perfect by any means. it's better than nothing and it was a solid first entry. If you simply don't like it.. Buy elsewhere. that's the beauty of Android. I think you guys forget, that out of our fanboy bubble, most people when they think of Android have a distinct definition. I'm talking the average consumer...they think Android = cheap phone from prepaid carrier that's slow, plastic, horrible camera & full of bugs. Or.. Android = Samsung Galaxy. Your average consumer still doesn't know what a Pixel is nvm that they don't even know what a Nexus was. Android phones need to be a premium product to compete. They need to charge the amount of money it takes for proper R&D.. Customer support etc. Google cannot sell at a loss and accomplish this. This very reason is why Samsung holds the Android crown. Regardless of your opinion towards their devices. Remember that Carrier subsidizing is how Galaxy devices sell by the millions. Iphones as well. Google is on the right path. They just need to bring the next Pixel to all carriers. Lindsay Meyer You're right. I've been an Apple user for a long time. Loved those iPhones and loyally stuck by them, albeit with a little less enthusiasm every year after iPhone 4s. I was bored, wanting to venture outside the Apple cycle (which is hard to break once you've spent $$$$$ over the years in apps and compatible Apple devices), and bitter that Apple essentially abandons support of their costly older models and all but forces you to continually upgrade. Also, I was tired of clinging to Apple's old identity as a game changer, seeing as their 7 was a nothing but new shade of lipstick (and their new iOS just made using the hardware on my 6s buggier and more annoying - using the home button w/ fingerprint ID was enough to make me want to throw my phone at the ground). SO.. Hubby, a long time member of the opposing Android camp, finally talked me into the Pixel, which is what I have now. I gotta say, aside from the gorgeous camera and the option to stick some widgets on my display, it's a let down. The fact that it was the same cost as an iPhone is, honestly, shocking. Many have said before me, and it's true, that Apple doesn't want the risk of unveiling truly new and innovative features. When Jobs left, there was no one crazy enough to continue to push the envelope and risk failure of Apple's #1 moneymaker, so now Apple excels at what Android (or at least my Pixel) does not - fluid, exceptionally clear and reliable usability, and an unfailingly friendly UI, omnipresent support and a $#¡+ ton of amazing, well-supported apps. Other phones, incl my Pixel, will have Cecil Hardwood BS. Google has been around long enough and have worked with many hardware companies. This is not new to them. They are not stupid. Just incompetent. MJ Yes, working with hardware companies is the same as being a hardware company for over 30 years. #facepalm madcanada Well, no, Google didn't just start. Pixel is not made any differently than Nexus - it's still a 3rd party product in essence. Google took tighter control of design, sure, but considering that they didn't dramatically change the approach I think it's fair to say that Google was in their form of hardware game for some time now, and as far as cellphones go Apple only had a few years of a headstart. MJ Your comment made no sense to me... You started with Google didn't just start followed by the Nexus/Pixel phones are basically 3rd party devices (true) than said "Google was in their form of hardware game for some time now". no idea what that means... Apple has been designing and in control of their iPhone devices almost from the start. They have even designed their own SoC. Apple has been a true hardware company from day one and for over 30 years now. Google is mainly a software and Internet company. madcanada Well, I just mean we're either saying that Google didn't yet even start being in the hardware game, or that they were in their hardware game (whatever the form it took - 3rd party or other) since the fist Nexus. It's not like with Pixel they're doing anything dramatically different, so your comment about Google being fairly new isn't entirely correct. They either still aren't a hardware company, which strengthens the position of the article, or they are a hardware company (that outsources the hardware) which didn't get on top of their game in almost a decade. MJ What? My argument is it's not fair to compare them to Apple in hardware experience and I already laid that out in very clear terms. mrjayviper Fairly new? How long have they been selling Nexus phones and other devices? MJ Let me get this straight... You left a comment without reading the whole discussion? I already very clearly laid out an actual argument but thanks for your input. brgulker Sure Apple charges Pixel prices, but if my iPhone is defective I can go to an Apple Store, get a replacement on the spot, and have some peace of mind that the extra expense went to maintaining this store and the general customer service model. With Google, the extra cost goes to the bottom line and maybe a month-long replacement process of ‘ship and pray’ with buggy refurbished replacements and full-price holds on my credit card. This is a really big part of why I decided to fully buy into the Apple ecosystem about a year and a half ago. I still own an Nvidia Shield for gaming, but that's it at the moment. That, and security updates, which at least some Google OEMs are taking more seriously now. madcanada my problem with pixel was the fact that compared to Nexus 6P they only gave an incremental update to processor and ram, everything else was literally the same. People will say "camera was different", I would beg the differ. Download Camera NX for Nexus 6P and do a comparison with Pixel, you'll see what I mean. They didn't bring back waterproofing, didn't give us a bigger battery, didn't give us wireless charging, and didn't give us a dual camera set up. It felt as if they took Nexus 6P, added ram and changed the sot, and then locked a bunch of features behind the new product. Sure I can understand timed exclusive of Assistant, I can even swallow Pixel launcher being exclusive, but not giving zero-shutter lag to Nexus 6P users (which Nexus is perfectly capable of) was a dick move. So we essentially got a slightly faster Nexus 6P at double the price with exclusive software features, which pissed everyone off because we bought Nexus over Galaxy for the Google support and all them features! Getting an iPhone next, didn't use one since 3GS, gonna try it out. Sammy Phillips At least the Pixel can process more than 1 HDR+ shot at a time. The 6P took forever doing that. madcanada what do you mean? how Nexus compresses them one by one in the gallery afterwards and Pixel can do few at a time? Sammy Phillips Yeah when you take an HDR+ image on the 6P you have to wait for it to finish before you can take more. They fixed that on the Pixel, although I read someone else's comment here that mentioned they could have brought that feature to the 6P as well. madcanada there are two types of HDR+ modes on Pixel, HDR+ Auto and HDR+. Auto is the zero-lag one, Pixel consistently taking photos as soon as you open camera, when you press the button it simply starts to process the last couple of shots. HDR+ will take time to evaluate the picture and then take the shots it needs to take, which is why there is lag and which is why HDR+ pictures look a bit better quality wise. Nexus did not have zero lag HDR+ auto up until Camera NX brought it over, but now Nexus can do the same thing as Pixel - take shots all the time and then just mark those it needs in Auto mode. You can take many consecutive HDR shots on Nexus with Camera NX, I haven't tested the upper limit, but it works for up to 10 shots just tapping as fast as my finger can do it. My issue is that some third party developer had to do it, Google just fucked us over. Paul_Werner Yep, Camera NX stopped me from missing out on pretty much every feature of the Pixel Camera. Not that I'd spend that type of money on a minor update (Pixel from 6P) madcanada same thing, the update too minor. what pissed me off is that Google didn't release the camera app themselves. T4rd I have a 6P, but am not a big picture taker, so I haven't cared about camera performance much. But I'm rooted (on Pure Nexus ROM) and am wondering if no one at XDA or something has ported the Pixel's camera app over to the 6P or other phones..? Or did Google lock it down to only Pixel hardware somehow? madcanada they did, Camera NX is exactly that. It's a Google Camera app from Pixel, basically. FRKSUP While I agree, it was overpriced for what it is, they had to set a precedent. If they made it Nexus cheap, and then raise the price this year when they add waterproofing, feature Y, etc. consumers (non-tech savy people who know cost 2016 vs cost 2017 and not the specs driving the cost) would question the change in price. They're never going to be able to compete with Apple with less-than-Apple experience phones at high prices, nor with equal-to-Apple experience phones with lower prices. madcanada I think the article brings up the right point about why that is. Google isn't aiming for Apple experience, they want Apple dough. We're the stuff they're selling. FRKSUP I disagree. If we are the stuff they're selling, they should make the best experience for the least price to get more of us to give up our data as easy and cheap as possible. Nexus was closer to that model than Pixel. Pixel is more about the experience for the end customer (us) than the data we type into it for them to sell. I do not think the ads differentiate based on what phone or how expensive it is. madcanada Pixel is, yes, Google's business model is not though. The difference is that if Apple can't sell any more iPhones - they go out of business. If Google can't sell Pixels - no one at Google would really even care that much - it's not their lifeline, even if you limit Google to Android in the scope of this conversation. Android would make money for Google regardless of how Google treats their customers. itguy08 "The difference is that if Apple can't sell any more iPhones - they go out of business. " Except Apple has the Mac business which they state is a Fortune 100 company by itself. Let that sink in just a little bit.... madcanada Okay there, Drax the Destroyer, we know nothing goes over your head. Suicide_Note I own both, and the Pixel camera far surpasses the 6P. madcanada are you using Camera NX instead of default Google Camera on Nexus? Alternatively are you using the HDR+ plus mode on both, because due the to the way zero-lag HDR works, Pixel uses higher ISO and the picture may look brighter. If you use Camera NX on Nexus you would get the same exact settings and same exact quality, not even close to "far surpassing". Feel free to verify yourself, compare pictures on the computer after, better yet post them here. Paul_Werner Yup or just watch Max Lee do it for you: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THwm57tjZQg madcanada that's a good video, but again it doesn't actually compare them the proper way. let me explain. Pixel is using a preset ISO for it's HDR+ auto mode, and that ISO is higher, so the shots could be taken quicker (mind you Pixel is doing it as soon as you open the camera app). That is why you see warmer tones and brighter pictures on the Pixel. Nexus (in the comparison video) is using the old HDR+ mode, the one where the phone evaluates the image and then takes a few shots with the ISO related to what the phone sees as opposed to what the preset for speed is. If the person in the video compared Pixel in HDR+ mode (the one with the lag), they would get identical to Nexus image - no warm tones, no overblown skies, and a bit darker overall. If Nexus was to use Camera NX in HDR+ auto mode - it would get identical images to Pixel in the comparison. Paul_Werner Oh I'm totally with you on that madcanada this guy did an updated video, with HDR+ on on both pixel and nexus, no auto. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZI81pqRLeEs this is what I was talking about ) Paul_Werner Yeah my Google-fu was a bit weak. I meant to find that video to share whispy_snippet Go and ask a regular consumer to do what you're asking. A camera is more than the hardware. madcanada what do you mean? whispy_snippet Most people, I think it's fair to say, stick with defaults. Default messaging app. Default web browser. Default mapping application. Just ask Apple! It's why they're so successful with lock-in. The point I'm making is that most people will stick to the default camera application when they purchase a phone. Out of the box, the Pixel's camera delivers much better images than the 6P. Sure, you could go trawling through the Google Play store to find a camera app for your 6P that gives you results closer to what you want. But most people will never even think to do this or even know it's possible. For this reason, Google took the time to develop a rock solid camera application with hugely impressive image processing. The resources and effort required to develop a kick ass camera experience out of the box is factored into the price. So when someone says "the camera is different" to the 6P, it is. The Pixel has a much better (arguably the best) camera out of the box and ultimately this is what matters to most people. madcanada I agree with your point, but it's entirely irrelevant to the discussion we're having. Nexus 6P and Pixel cameras are identical, save for 12.2 MP vs 13 MP respectively, the difference is only in software​. If Google cared about their customers they would've released the same camera app for Nexus themselves, instead some XDA dude did it. Without the artificial gap created by Google, Pixel is just a tat faster Nexus 6p, so charging twice the price and justifying it by simply fucking over the customer base is extremely annoying. whispy_snippet You said: 'People will say "camera was different", I would beg the differ.' I'm saying the camera on the Pixel IS different because of the software (the app and ISP). The software is everything and was the product of years of research and development work from Google. It's the reason why they were able to enter the market with their first, genuine mainstream flagship phone and trump Apple and Samsung's best cameras immediately. My point is entirely relevant. Correct me if I'm wrong, but it sounds like you're pissed off that you're not getting the same experience with your 6P camera as Pixel customers are getting with their cameras - even though the hardware is fundamentally very similar. Am I right more or less? Look, I can sympathise to an extent. I was a Nexus user from way back. But ultimately, the Pixel was a more expensive device than the 6P. Pixel owners paid more and got a better camera. Why would Google try to bring a cheaper device's camera up to the same level? They want to sell more high end Pixels, not last gen's dead (RIP) Nexus 6P. When people try to argue "the Pixel is so expensive but the price isn't justified" this is one of the reasons why I say it actually is. madcanada That's correct, I'm pissed that Pixel gets a better camera software while Nexus is fundamentally the same in the department. I understand your point about camera being a combination of both hardware and software, but unlike, say, Apple, where each iteration is actually better in terms of hardware, and older iPhones still get whatever features they can physically run, Google decided to accentuate the difference by simply denying their last year phone the same updates. Where Apple only denies updates when the old phone can't actually handle them Google is simply abandoning their last year model to justify the price of the Pixel. whispy_snippet Except there's one key difference. Unlike iPhones that release each year, the Nexus 6P is not of the Pixel lineage. The Pixel is the first of its kind. madcanada That makes not a shred of difference in the argument I'm making. I find denying last year phone updates it perfectly capable of running, so you can justify the price of the new phone ethically questionable. I don't care if they rebranded, their decision to not give Nexus the updates it can handle is only guided by the fact that they wanted to charge twice the price for Pixel, and they couldn't have if Nexus got the goodies. whispy_snippet Ethically questionable? No, mate, it's business. Google's ultimate responsibility is maximising profits for shareholders. You're cranky that your 6P can't do what the more expensive a Pixel can do. Now imagine how Pixel owners would feel if they saw cheaper, older phones from the same company doing exactly the same thing as theirs. Again, I sympathise to an extent, but ultimately you get what you pay for. If you want the Pixel experience, buy it. madcanada I'm not cranky because my Nexus 6P can't do things Pixel can, on the contrary, I get full Pixel experience with free unlimited full size photo upload, Pixel launcher, Pixel camera, and day one Google Assistant on Nexus 6P. I'm cranky because I need to go to XDA to get them goodies. I understand it's business, but if you want to sell charge twice for the phone - sell a better phone, give us a better camera, bigger battery life, and don't downgrade our goddamn speakers. whispy_snippet Mate, you're simply not making sense anymore. You're effectively wanting something for nothing. You want Google to give you a Pixel quality camera experience on an older, less expensive phone from an entirely different lineage - for free. You're not entitled to free stuff. I guess we're just going to have to agree to disagree. madcanada you can disagree all your want, i outlined my gripe with Google in the first post, then you decided to argue about the camera. New lineage or not, when you market Nexus as the phone that gets all the Google love, and then you just leave users behind right next generation simply to justify the price hike of new Pixel - that's low. Apple's feature fragmentation is driven solely by the hardware - newer phones get new exclusive features because older models can't do the same thing physically. Google is creating artificial fragmentation in order to justify twice the price. That's not the Google I remember and that's not the direction I like. Obviously it's their choice. T4rd Did you mean "Camera MX", not "NX"? I'm not seeing a "NX" in the Play Store, just "MX": https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.magix.camera_mx. madcanada you have to google an apk. wait up. https://forum.xda-developers.com/nexus-6p/themes-apps/mod-camera-nx-v4-google-camera-zsl-hdr-t3494435 T4rd Ahh, nice. Thanks! madcanada you just need the one apk, don't worry about 60 fps mod, it's already there. Ocepi The biggest failure was the verizon "exclusivity". The Verizon edition has almost always been readily available since launch, but most consumers don't realize it is unlocked. William R. Washington I just had a friend walk into Best Buy, buy a Verizon model and pop his AT&T SIM, and he couldn't be happier. FRKSUP Most sheep don't know this though... Sir_Brizz And then when he has problems with it and Google won't help him nor Verizon or Best Buy? Steve McQueen Now that Huawei's new EMUI 5+ doesn't horribly suck, I'm liking them more and more. Can't see myself ever spending pixel money for a phone that doesn't get 7-9 hours of SOT on a single charge. skeeterfood Unless they finally start updating their phones to keep up with the Android security patches (My Honor 8 is still on the Dec 2016 security patch) and start releasing their kernel source in a timely matter, my Honor 8 will be the last Hauwei phone I ever touch... Mix I love stock Android and when the PIxel works it is an amazing phone; HOWEVER, I am on my 3rd 128GB Pixel XL and, so help me, if this ones dies I am fucking DONE with it. Google will be refunding that shit. Suicide_Note What happened with the other two? I'm genuinely curious because my 128 GB XL has been fantastic since day one. Mix 1st - Microphone died less than 3 weeks in. 2nd - Phone was at 95% charge, playing a game on my lunch and it bricked. 3rd one has been stellar (so far) but my 2nd one was great until a few weeks before it died. It starting rebooting itself and freezing. Warranty replacement's from Google have been good though it sucks not having a phone for 7 days. This is my 4th Android phone and hardware wise, my worst phone that I have ever owned. John Doe I am pretty sure Google sends you a replacement out first then you send back yours and they send it by next day shipping. T4rd Yeah, they cross-shipped my 6P when I RMA'd it so I wouldn't be without a phone until its replacement arrived. I didn't have to pay extra for it either. Mix Since I have done 2 RMA's with Google (Canada) I kind of know what they do. You can either have them place a hold for the phone ($1,400) on your creditcard and they ship you a phone, one you get it you put the label on the box and send it back and they release the hold once they get the phone, OR, you can do the no holds but you send them back your busted phone first and once they get it and look at it they send you your new device. Next day shipping it is not! 1st phone was 5 days to arrive from the day I called and my second phone was 7 days. 1st phone was easier to deal with as I could still use it for everything but calls, the second phone was bricked to no phone for a week kind of sucks. John Doe Ok so you chose the bad option that is your fault. Apple does the same exact thing. And it is next day here in the USA so maybe if you complained a bit they would have made it next day or 2 day shipping. Also wtf?...$1,400? Was that the cost of the phone? Mix Sounds like you have not done this before because sending your phone to Google first, waiting for them to get it and look it over THEN sending a replacement is, 100%, the bad choice. Having them send you the phone first and put a hold on your creditcard is the better and faster choice! Complaining gets you nothing, USA got free daydream headsets, Canadians got nothing. The phone, after taxes, was $1,320.48 - close enough for me to complain about it at the $1,400 point, lol. John Doe OMG, YOU CAN'T READ? That is what I said Google does but you said you had to wait 7 days for your phone but they send you the phone first then you send yours in so no waiting. Yes I have done this before. With Apple, Google, and other companies...it is standard practice. No, they don't charge you taxes they just put a hold of the price of the phone not your total purchase price. Maybe it is just different in Canada...you should stop buying Google products there *rolls eyes* Lindsay Meyer If your damaged, soon-to-be-returned Pixel phone is broken and unusable, there would indeed be a waiting period to have a working phone in either case, because, being unable to easily switch your device at a physical brick and mortar store, you would be at the mercy of waiting for for Google's mailed replacement to have a working phone again. John Doe Google sens it next day here in the US Mix You straight up told me that I chose the bad option: "Ok so you chose the bad option that is your fault." when I did not choose the bad option. If my phone bricked, which it did, and it takes 7 days for Googles phone to get to me I have no phone for 7 days, that is waiting without a phone! I think we are both right, 12 of this and a dozen of that, lol. <3 Stuff in Canada is more expensive and shipping generally sucks. I normally chose 2 day shipping with Amazon and get refunded shipping costs because the shipping companies miss the delivery date constantly. Nexus 4 and 5 have been sweet, my Pixel experience has been garbage. Their customer service has been good though so yay for that. Lindsay Meyer Canadian $ ≠ US $ John Doe Yeah but the phone still does not cost $1,400 in canada so yeah destinyhud google needs a sales center for all their hardware. heck even a google rep at bestbuy would do Juan Sutton The only way Google has dropped the ball is by not having enough stock to fill the demand, other wise the pixel is a great phone and it's been a joy to use since day one tim242 You are living in an alternate reality #alternativefacts Juan Sutton Naw bro, the vast majority of people that own the phone love the phone. The software experience (which in my opinion is the most important thing) is great. tim242 Software is nothing without reliable hardware Juan Sutton Ok, the pixel has that. But again the vast majority are not buying phones based on hardware, geeks obsess after that. they are buying the software on the phone and the eco system around it. When I take my phone out my pocket and begin to use it what does it do and how well it does it. tim242 The vast majority buy based on hardware, which is why Samsung sells so many phones. Juan Sutton The vast majority don't even know about hardware, just ask the average consumer. They couldnt tell what type of processor or pixels per square inch or any other hardware question. Samsung sells phones because then advertise like crazy, and most of the time when you go into a store the sales people push you to a iPhone or galaxy. Now I didn't say hardware isn't part of the equation. But not the most important. Now I do agree, most geeks buy based on hardware but not the average consumer. I'm out, have to go to work Lateef Alabi-Oki We are Google's customers. Let's see what happens to Google without us. Then the debate about whether or not we are customers is a non-starter. This idea that Google doesn't care about you because of advertising is a hopelessly flawed argument. Google just doesn't devote as many resources to being good a making, distributing, and MARKETING hardware as they do with their software services. If they devoted as much effort as Apple to the complete life cycle of making, selling and supporting their hardware, they'd be just as good as Apple, if not better. Investments in hardware cannot be short-term and half-assed. The currency for consumers buying and investing in hardware is trust. This is something Apple is keenly aware of, and Google is going to, unfortunately, have to figure out the hard way. You can't keep disowning and disavowing your products with reckless abandon and establish trust with users. You can't stop providing OS and security updates for perfectly functioning devices and earn users' loyalty. If Apple launched the iTurd, not only will it sell out in minutes, it will sell in millions of units. That's the power of an infinite brand cache. That's the power of trust. That's the power of loyalty. It happens when companies stand by their product no matter what. This is Google's fundamental crisis. Even their most ardent supporters are left anxious about how soon they'll abandon their products, much less how long they'll support it. Is it any wonder why they can't sell anything other than ads? opticalgenesis very confused when I read "#donglife" instead of "#donglelife" mjsalinger The idea that "we are not the customer" in ad-supported businesses is a fallacy created by Apple fan-boys to try to argue that Apple is inherently superior to Google. In ad-supported businesses, the user *is* the end-customer of the business' products, and the advertisers are the monetization source 'partners'. At the end of the day, the value of ads lessens greatly if the end customers aren't happy with the product produced. For a TV show, if the show is crap, then it will get lower ratings, and therefore fewer advertisers will want to purchase ads or they will only purchase ads at a lower price. Same with a newspaper. Although newspapers usually charge a small fee, most of the cost and profit is obtained via advertising. But if the product is crappy, it won't sell and ad $'s decline. In a case like Google, it's products and services are designed for users, to keep the user (who is the end "customer" of those products and services, not the advertiser, even if said products are free) happy. Happy users mean more users, and more users mean more advertisers wanting to reach those users for greater $ amounts, which means more profit for Google. The same is true for any ad-supported business. The customer relationship isn't necessarily related to who foots the bill (the monetization source), but who is the user. How it's monetized is a different question entirely. Even in most direct-to-consumer products, the customer doesn't directly buy the product from the producer of that product. If I buy an LG TV from Best Buy, for example, my transaction isn't with LG, but it's with Best Buy. Best Buy is LG's direct customer, and LG is dependent on Best Buy and other retailers purchasing enough stock to move it's product. While the line between monetization source and end-customer is closer in a direct-sale relationship than an ad-supported one, it's still not direct. An exception where there actually is a direct relationship between a consumer and a company is a case like buying an iPhone directly from the Apple Store; but the indirect nature still applies if you buy an iPhone at Verizon or at Best Buy... So can we please stop with the "we're not Google's customer" fallacy? We certainly are, because we use the products Google creates, and if we don't use them, then Google doesn't get $$. It's just slightly more indirect than with direct sale-to-consumer products... whispy_snippet 100% this. Cecil Hardwood I disagree. Google is selling data they gathered from you using their services. The people buying the data is the customer. The people using the services are users. mjsalinger You can disagree all you want, but from an economics point of view, you're wrong. 1) Google doesn't sell data. They sell ads that you can target to specific demographics. 2) The services are a product. If the product isn't good and doesn't keep a user base, then no ads. 3) 'Customer' doesn't always signify a monetary transaction. There are many examples in business where people are referred to as customers without a monetary transaction. In Google's case they have two customers. One, they sell adspace to a certain # of people in specific demographics for money. The second, they provide services for users in exchange for viewing ads. Both are customer relationships (providing a good or service in exchange for something of value). Nerds Logic Guess I should feel lucky. My wife and I both have pixel's and I have yet to have an issue with it. Not the ones mentioned in comments or any others. And I use the shit out of this phone. Also, this makes my 30th Android phone and only the 1st to not be rooted. tim242 "So why as a consumer do I continue to throw my money at a lover who could care less?" *couldn't care less rattyuk This is an American / British thing. I assume your from the U.K. where couldn't care less is the phrase. In the USA it's the opposite. But really this is a tempest in a teapot, the American way of saying... Well you can guess. Two nations separated by the same language. tim242 I am in the US. The phrase is "couldn't care less". Peoppe just say it incorrectly. If you could care less, that means that you have some level of caring. If you could not care less, that means you don't care at all. Oh, and it's "you're from", not "your from". : ) Roger Siegenthaler Google most definitely does have to find a new way to make money except for ads and they know it. There's their investor notes that detail them knowing that adblockers and regulatory changes could prove very damaging to their ad revenue. And their intention to get <50% of their revenue from ads by 2020 all say truckloads about why they desperately want to get google home and pixels selling. sweenish I don't like the Apple store argument. I live in Wichita, the most populous city in Kansas. Everyone lives on the Missouri side of Kansas City. I have no Apple store. Plenty of other people don't have this recourse to fall back on. It's a bogus argument that holds no water outside of a 1 hour radius of Apple stores, and that's a massive chunk of the US. Sammy Phillips Well, it's not really a "bogus" argument as much as one that doesn't apply to a certain percentage of consumers. I think, though, that even if you don't live near an Apple store, you're likely to get a replacement from them faster and more reliably than Google. sweenish Based on what? Google has, by most accounts really stepped up their customer service for hardware issues, and that's been the case for a couple years now. And if an argument doesn't apply, it's bogus. And like I've said, it didn't apply to a lot of people. Sammy Phillips Ah, that's not what my understanding of it is. I've been under the impression that getting replacement Pixel is kind of a nightmare. I hear you though. My parents have iPhones and they live over an hour from an Apple store. Not exactly right around the corner. Aloys Garnier de Kermerc’hou I strongly disagree. You can't judge a company's strategy on the first attempt. Wait for at least the 2nd generation to declare if Google is dropping the ball or not. Right now the Pixel has been hailed, with all its flaws and shortcomings, as the best Android phone of 2016. For a first shot, it's a hell of an achievement. Sure, it's not sexy. It's not water resistant. It doesn't have stereo speakers. But it still was enough of a success that Google didn't keep up with the demand. The question is "will they have learned for the 2nd generation?". If they did, then they have a recipe for success. Google Home, Google Wifi, Nest, these are indicators that Google is moving into the hardware space and that can't happen without a mobile phone lineup. Google isn't dropping the ball, they were testing the waters, and they were too shy about it. Let's wait and see about Pixel 2. pfmiller This wasn't their first attempt just because it's the first phone with a new name. Aloys Garnier de Kermerc’hou Same comment as I did for Bruce Wayne above. Google didn't even try for Nexus. It was more or less a developer's program that worked on the word-of-mouth. Nothing comparable to the amount of advertisement done for the Pixel, which was comparable to Apple's. pfmiller So they didn't do a good job before, that doesn't mean they didn't do it before. That only makes their mistakes less excusable. Next time will they have learned for the 9th generation? Doesn't sound so likely now, does it? Aloys Garnier de Kermerc’hou It's not that they didn't do a good job before. Before it simply wasn't a strategy to push the Nexus line. It was primarily intended as a developer-oriented, sort of geek-appealing program. Never pushed as a product for the masses like the Pixel was. Look, you can criticize as much as you want, there are many things Google could have done better. But wait for the second generation before you say "they dropped the ball". That will be a much better indicator than any pseudo-analysis made by people like us who only see a tiny window of the situation. Bruce Wayne They've been selling phones for years now. They're not new to the game. Aloys Garnier de Kermerc’hou They never tried with the Nexus. Little to no advertising. Pixel was a whole different story. They did try and seemed to sell more than they anticipated. You have to compare oranges to oranges. Sir_Brizz This same argument was made when the Nexus 4 came out, because that also represented a shift in how the Nexus program was marketed and worked. TBF, the N5, N6, and 6P all got about the same amount of advertising as the Pixel has gotten. Ultimately, those programs could be considered a success because they sold those devices at a price point relative to their value proposition. I didn't mind having a hold on my account for my 6P, but that was also $300+ less than a comparable Pixel XL. I also knew I was buying a device with slower support and I was paying a good deal less for that. Pixel doesn't change much (it's just another Nexus with the same concessions and everything), but it does shift Google into a new game where they actually have to make a value proposition now, and they aren't in a good position to do that. The fact that they can't even keep stock of the Pixels is a pretty sad indicator of how ill prepared they are. Aloys Garnier de Kermerc’hou Oh no. Not even close in terms of advertising. 6P got a little bit of it. But the amount of TV air time, of billboards and online ads? You can't be serious when you say the N5, 6 and 5x/6P got the same treatment. Maybe the closest was the 6 but is was mostly a carrier-level, b&m stores level one. Sir_Brizz I know it's hard to remember, but they did give lots of advertising. Even the N7 had a super bowl commercial. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_12rHKqFD0 They have advertised these devices in the past. There is nothing that unique about the Pixel. Maybe it is slightly more, but I basically don't hear about it anymore. It had a decent initial push and now it's just like it was before. UniBroW This post summarizes why I have an iPhone 7 plus instead of a pixel in my pocket after years of dismissing Apple entirely sebastianer I can throw bullshit to the Nexus and Pixel line, while praising a lot the iPhones... But I can't still switch to an iPhone...even the latest iPhone 7 after 1-2 hours using it i want to kill myself (sarcastically). Also I've been using an iPhone for a week after my LG 5X died...but after a week ended up buying a 6P and can't be more happy (no matter the years I hated phablet...it's still so good to be using vanilla Android again). Most of the people can switch from iOS to Android or from Android to iOS...I'm part of the small group that can't switch to iOS, it's so different the way it works and so different to the way I use the phone. (As some people is part of the small group that can switch from iOS to Android, despite the hardware quality between Apple vs Nexus/Pixels). And when I say Android, I'm only referring to Nexus/Pixel/AndroidOne... Maybe Moto...but no. UniBroW I agree, mostly. There are so many things that make me want to throw the iPhone out the window so it's not all just peaches and cream but I went full on iOS. Sold my Pixel C for an iPad Pro and ordered a mini that I'm installing in my car dash as Android Auto and car play leave much to be desired. Overall though, I'm enjoying iOS more. I used to use iOS and think it was cumbersome but swiping back to go back in an app is way more intuitive then Androids broken back button that will either close an app or go back. Not to mention Google play music is much nicer from a ui standpoint on iOS then Android Knowledgeborn Allah ^^^Exactly! This is precisely what led me to purchase an iPhone 7+ too. I have a Pixel XL also, but I ran into so many problems with it that I gave up and haven't used it in months. For Google to be charging iPhone prices for the Pixel, they definitely don't deliver on the iPhone experience. I bashed Apple for years based almost entirely on specs, pushing the narrative that their products are overpriced. But, now that Google is charging the same prices for products that are clearly inferior, what does that say about them? I was a die-hard Nexus user for years, buying nearly all of them since the Nexus 4 (with the exception of the 5X). And that's the biggest problem with the Pixel line as a whole. I had the Nexus 6P, and it beats out the Pixel XL in more than one area. I'd go so far as to say that the Pixel phones are essentially just a new Nexus devices, with a higher price tag and "made by Google" promotion. Sudarshan Krish It is absolutely not true that Google is not as good as Apple when it comes to replacements. Having bought my pixel off the Google store in the UK, replacement for me has been spontaneous, everytime I've had an issue with my phone.. It is almost as good as the next day delivery. Google has never let me down when it comes to covering me with replacement of my faulty devices, let alone pixel, even with my Nexusus (4, 6p) EcE Which store did you step into and talked to a person and get a replacement on the spot for your Nexus 4? destinyhud a call to customer care. not in stores Sudarshan Krish Sorry, I should have mentioned. I bought it online on Google play store here in the UK which is now the Google store.. Every time I've had an issue with my device they've RMAed it and sent a new device promptly! Hope that answers your question mate EcE That's cool. But it's not at the same level of customer care. They are charging a premium for all their products now and when there are issues, in some cases people are not as lucky as you have been. It's not difficult to find people complaining about waiting for weeks before getting a replacement. Something you can get done at an Apple store. I'm not a fan boy, I wish Google had their shit together but the fact is that they don't in most places in the world. UniBroW That's not as good, and when you had that you also had a hold for the full amount of the phone on your card. Also, good luck having them fix a screen on a broken Pixel C or Nexus 6p if you should be so unlucky to break one rmagruder My burning desire to get a Pixel went down the crapper the day I discovered Camera NX and zero-lag HDR+ auto on the 6P. I'll take my front firing stereo speakers, as well, thank you. Google really really overpriced the Pixel. They almost got away with the camera sleight of hand, but Camera NX fixes that. I'll wait and see what happens with the Pixel 2. And on another note, anyone note that the android audio latency is still not great on a Pixel, and it doesn't sound like other OEM's are stepping up either. Until Google a) delivers its own phone with sub 10ms audio loopback latency through the headphone jack and b) uses its Google Play licensing to make sure every OEM does as well, Android will continue to be a joke in the music-creation/DAW/Smule business. 4Ui812 Hey Trevor , your boss told me to tell you to refer to the Pixel phone as the Fixel from now. 😃 magnamentis no details, just generally think into the same direction but want to add that without that "bias" which you mentioned, one with a clear analytic approach could start to see it coming with the nexus 6 ( i own it ) and the 6p/5x line were in parts confirming my reservations and the pixel has not even been on my list to consider anymore. the last great "nexus" was the N5 which of course i own as well and the nexus 4 at it's time was a very nice phone as well. all the rest like pricing an the likes you mentioned, not talking even about huge bezels and too many flaws (defective devices etc) i'm just wondering how long ti will take (hopefully never) until you will have to divert from your straight line of thinking (and writing) and moderate the little bit that counts to survive (the web is cruel as we know and many don't want to hear the truth but only confirmation that their decisions were smart and right ) kudos and good luck iernie *couldn't care less Sorry, I just had to. You're saying Google could actually care less about you when I think you tried to convey the opposite. ipsofact Well written article. Bienvenido :) ! sebastianer 750€ for a Pixel that still has terrible compass accuracy, also can't retain accuracy, compared to old Phones like the iPhone 5S...using-the-same-google-Maps-application. 24 months of updates... And who knows if it's gonna boot loop or kill the battery in the next 8-12 months like the 5X and the 6P did. I'm gonna wait for the Next pixel line... YouNex Wtf is this article ? No matter which camp you belong to, this will still trigger you ! Calm down AP, sometimes you need to think twice before taking a dump like this.. Mark McCoskey I guess I'm a bit of a fanboy myself. I'm using a 2+ year old Moto Nexus 6 on Project Fi. I prefer the pure Android experience, with it's frequent updates (like Apple iOS). I am not a fan of the Pixel's "Premium" price, though. I'm a cheap bastard. I'm holding out for the release of US Android One's. I even periodically Tweet Sundar about Google's need to open up Fi to all manufactures, making all phones Fi ready, and the NEED for budget, sub $300 pure Android phones and tablets. I like Project Fi's low cost, and want a pure Android phone, tablet to match. ddevito Can we just finally say the Pixel is an overall failure? Whether we're talking hardware, specs, pricing, customer service, etc...This thing so far has been a failure for Google. On this site you're either a Pixel lover or labeled a troll, yet now even the AP staff is writing posts about this. Averix I don't know if you can class it as a failure. They've sold a decent number of them from what we can infer. Even without the wireless charging, waterproofing, and having bezels the size of an iPhone, it seems to be selling ok. Personally, I hate it. It looks like a home button neutered iPhone. But, that doesn't necessarily mean it's a failure in the marketplace. ddevito It's been riddled with issues, they can't make enough or ship them, their customer service is atrocious. And it's extremely expensive. In any other industry that's considered a failure. Google gets a pass because the industry needs and wants a solid Apple competitor. Inexcusable mjsalinger Actually, that's *not* how they define success or failure in any industry. 1) "They can't make enough or ship them". That implies that their demand is far exceeding their planned supply. That's usually a sign of *success* in the marketplace, not failure. 2) Riddled with issues: So that's a hard one to say. Pretty much every consumer device has many issues, and they often get amplified on the Internet. I know several people with Pixels with zero issues, so I'm not sure how widespread the issues really are for most people. 3) "Their customer service is atrocious": What evidence do you have? Google's customer service has been top-notch in the past few years. Also, many product successes happen with poor customer service on the other end. Not the case here, but that doesn't come close to defining it as a "failure". 4) Expensive: That's your subjective opinion. It is on the higher end of phones, but if it's still selling at a high price, that's the very definition of success in an industry, not failure. tl; dr; None of the above points would indicate a failure in any industry - in fact, at least two of them would indicate *success*. Sir_Brizz 1) Or, they just can't produce even a small amount of them quickly. Which, given HTCs history, is not very unlikely here. 2) But it does have at least as many issues as any Nexus phone. 4) It's not subjective to say it's expensive. It's relative to previous Google phones. It's more expensive than the Nexus 6 and the Galaxy Nexus, both also partnered with carriers and relatively more expensive than other Nexus devices. Also, it is the same high price as the most expensive phones in the industry right now. mjsalinger 1) Maybe, that's possible. But the argument was made "they can't keep up with supply, therefore the Pixel is a failure." I'm not making an argument as to whether the Pixel is a failure or not, I'm saying that @ddevito didn't present any real evidence that the Pixel was a failure. I presented one reason why they can't keep up with demand. You presented another. Both are possible. But there's not enough evidence presented here to say which one is true, and neither prove that the Pixel is a failure as a product. 2) As does the Galaxy S7, iPhone 7, etc... Phones have issues. Maybe the Pixel has more, maybe not. But that doesn't define whether it's a failure as a product. 4) Sure, it's more expensive than the previous Google products and at the same high price as the most expensive phones. But the argument was that the product was a failure because it was expensive. My point was an economic one - if people are willing to pay for it at that price, then it's not "extremely expensive" for the market and it's not evidence that the product is a failure.. My whole point is that the Pixel can't be declared a failure by the arguments presented by @ddevito:disqus. They don't add up. Sir_Brizz 1) However, one of the scenarios is actually realistic and lines up with our history of both companies in manufacturing. The other is not. 2) I'm not arguing that the phone is the only one with problems, but I would say that it doesn't have less problems than a normal Nexus phone, which tended to have more problems generally speaking than a mainstream OEM phone would. Again, there is historical precedent on this one. 4) I would argue that it does make the phone less likely to succeed than otherwise, but I don't really know what his fail state was. The Pixel is definitely not a great successor to the Nexus line, definitely not a "new generation" of Google devices, etc. From those perspectives it IS a failure. It could still be a financial success (though, I personally doubt it's much more financially viable than any Nexus phone). ddevito Just because they can't ship them out fast enough does not automatically imply high demand. Not even close, if you believe that you're a blind fanboy and not worthy of an adult conversation. The issues are documented and proven. Not widespread for many but there are definitely issues with a lot, indicating poor quality assurance. Yes their customer service sucks. Not just for Pixel. It takes DAYS for G Suite support to fix my issues at times, I RMA'd a couple devices in the past, absolutely horrendous. Expensive. Okay so by your definition a Ferrari isn't necessarily expensive. The Pixel is a high priced phone. When you sell at that price, expectations rise. Welcome to Capitalism. Take your fanboy cap off once and a while. mjsalinger > Just because they can't ship them out fast enough does not automatically imply high demand. Of course it doesn't. But it also doesn't imply that it's a failure, as you indicated. So, this isn't evidence either way, and you didn't present any. On the issues with the phone, yes they are documented and proven. There are also plenty of documented and proven issues with the Galaxy S7, iPhone 7, etc... This is something that all smartphones have and go through. This is also Google's first phone, so this isn't alone enough to declare the Pixel a "failure", although it's probably your most credible point. > I RMA'd a couple devices in the past, absolutely horrendous. Agree with you there, used to be pretty bad. But their support lately has been outstanding in the device department. I had to RMA a Nexus device recently, went through a couple of diagnostic steps, and then got my replacement phone two days later with a shipping label to ship the old one back. NBD. > Expensive. Okay so by your definition a Ferrari isn't necessarily expensive. The Pixel is a high priced phone. When you sell at that price, expectations rise. Welcome to Capitalism. No, a Ferrari is expensive to me, but not necessarily to the type of person who would buy a Ferrari. Ferrari is targeting a higher price point than I can afford, but there are many who are willing. That's how capitalism works. And it being "expensive" or not doesn't determine that it is a failure. Otherwise, by your own definition, Ferrari's are failures because they are expensive. Last I checked, Ferrari's were selling quite well. This has nothing to do with my being a "Fanboy" or not. It has everything to do with you declaring the Pixel a failure and making arguments to support that fact that don't in any way indicate that the phone is a failure (except maybe the quality one, that's your only decent argument here...) whispy_snippet It has not been "riddled with issues". What nonsense. The odd software bug is something any device experiences whether it be from Google, Apple, Samsung or whoever. They haven't been able to make enough to ship them. That's correct. But that's not a failure of the Pixel but a failure of Google's relationships with suppliers. And finally, on the matter of price, it's not "extremely expensive" when compared to other high end flagship phones. ddevito Right. You just proved my point. When you put it all together you have a failure. Not every product sold is a success, sure they sold a few and sure they probably made money on it (but obviously without disclosing those numbers they're hiding something), but this isn't just any other OEM. It's the platform defacto owner. If Microsoft had a similar experience with the Surface it would have been DOA. Yet Google gets a pass because the media and the Android fanboys won't have it. You're not better than iSheep. whispy_snippet Put what all together? I deconstructed each of your points and the only issue still standing is a supply constraint - not a product problem. The first Surface, hell multiple iterations of the Surface, had its issues. That doesn't make it a failure. What it sounds like, to me, is wishful thinking. You seem to want the Pixel to be a failure so you've constructed some shonky narrative to fit your wish. The Pixel has a supply constraint issue. That's it. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ It's impossible for any Google phone to be a failure because, well, because Google. Google could sell a picture of a phone scribbled in crayon as the Pixel 2, and Android web sites would say it's the Best Android Phone of 2017. Self-preservation. Sir_Brizz I just want to give you mad props that you didn't say "we are the product" or some version of that. It's a reciprocal relationship. Google provides us great services and we provide some aggregate data they can use to get more advertisers. The services they provide us are the products they create, not the other way around. I also have to agree that Pixel seems like a departure. I also don't think Google is in a position to compete in the handset market the way the Pixel implies they are. Their support capabilities and turnaround times, and the overall customer experience they can provide, are significantly inferior to even the worst OEM in their price bracket right now (probably HTC, which is saying something). I don't think that's a good thing. It really seems like this program needed some more time to bake, but really it should have been baking since the day they bought Motorola. Patrick Smithopolis The high price is a personal problem. I'm not sure what the lack of new stock has to do with you unless you're looking for a device. The replacement process is not ideal because they don't have brick and mortar stores. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman "...maybe a month-long replacement process of ‘ship and pray’ with buggy refurbished replacements and full-price holds on my credit card." I contacted Google by chat on Friday to describe my problem. My replacement arrives tomorrow. Outside of being able to walk into an Apple store and walk out with the replacement, nobody's warranty support is as good as Google's when purchased from their store. Sir_Brizz You do still have a full price hold on your credit card, though. I generally agree that Google has as good support as you can get with the methods they have available. However, the fact that it is not comparable to their competitors by default means that the phone has a lower value proposition. That's not as much a complaint about their support as it is about their pricing. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman I can't think of a single company that's ever done an advance exchange for me that didn't put a full-price hold on my credit card. It's standard. If you're willing to send it to them first, they won't. But if you want one sent to you first, they have to secure the value. I don't fault this. I don't find the phone incomparable to its competitors at all. But that's a non sequitur. Has nothing to do with the quote I was arguing against. Sir_Brizz I can't think of one, either. But that does make the fact they don't have any real in-store support (even at carrier stores, really) even harder to cope with. Even with Samsung, I can use my carrier store as a last resort if I am having problems. As far as the value proposition, I was pointing out that support plays into the value proposition of the device. From that perspective, it has everything to do with what you were arguing. Kevin Davis Verizon has done a no hold exchange for me, more than once. As a matter of fact, a couple of months ago, I had 2 "extra" iPhone 7 plus 128Gb models in my house that I had to send back to them. It's true, they do have my account info, but they have never placed an additional monetary hold on any card of mine that they have on record. Sir_Brizz Great, if you have Verizon. Oh, I see you were pointing out a company that didn't do a hold. Sorry. I guess there are a few. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman My experience with carriers is that they facilitate the process of the warranty exchange with the manufacturer, but you're still stuck with their terms. So when my daughter's phone's charging port broke, we took it into the carrier, and they charged me a $35 fee to handle the process for us, in which case a backordered replacement was shipped to the store later the next week, which we then came in to pick up. It wasn't a bad experience, but it wasn't a great one. And we had to jump through a lot of hoops to prove the issue to them, which I didn't with Google. And yes, I actually purposefully pay more for my phones to get Google's support. I learned the hard way from earlier Nexus devices how despite sometimes getting a deal from third-party stores, it was worth it to buy from them to gain access to their amazing support. So yes, for me it is part of the value proposition, but in a positive way. Certainly of ALL Android options, since I have zero interest in Apple, they're unrivaled. Sir_Brizz That is completely true, however it's the in-store experience that makes a difference. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman I'd far rather spend 5-10 minutes online from home getting my replacement shipped to me for free than having to go into a store, talk to someone who's less knowledgeable about my phone than I am, convince them to get it replaced, and then pay them an additional $35 to have them facilitate my phone then getting shipped to their store where I have to return to pick it up. Sir_Brizz But most people will feel less like that than you when their phone isn't working at all. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman If it still takes a week to get the replacement as was my experience, I don't see what difference it makes. Again, only Apple's consistently better in this regard, and irrelevant to those of us who don't want Apple products. Sir_Brizz What? I've used AT&T and T-Mobile to get replacements, I just walk in, hand them my broken phone, they give me a new one, and I'm on my way. Sometimes there is a "deductible" or something but if I need my phone right then, that's better than waiting forever. I agree that Apple is consistently better, but the carriers aren't that bad depending on your situation. I guess that Google is somewhat equally comparable to a carrier store in some fringe situations. Daniel Corbett I got one of the Google live cases and within 6 months it's useless. The live case software works only for days before it requires bring reset. After the charging port failed I went through the replace scenario. So far the refurbished replacement is adequate. Hopefully that continues. Kevin Davis I admire you for being able to use one of their"live" cases for 6 months. I purchased one for my Pixel XL and it was the slickest phone case I've ever owned, by far. I could have sprayed my naked phone down with WD40 and had a better grip. Marty Lol VAVAMk_2 One carrier in US and not enough inventory sucks Vega007 Works great on T-Mobile. VAVAMk_2 But for those who buy from carriers only 1 option. I buy from Google, but I know most people in US buy directly from their carrier. Eric Brown I feel like the article over-simplifies the in store experience at the Apple store when dealing with iPhones. It's extremely frustrating in reality. You have to schedule an appointment which is usually days out (same amount of time it would take to ship a Pixel). After scheduling the appointment, and you show up days later at the specified time, you generally have to wait around in the store for the service. Any customer in there trying to buy a new phone is supported immediately, but the existing customer with an appointment is forced to wait around. It's a terrible model and I don't give Apple any points for it. Sir_Brizz This isn't always the case. Especially when I've had a broken device, I can usually get an appointment within a couple hours and they will give me a refurbished device the same day. I have many complaints about Apple support for sure, but they really can't be beat on having a store you can actually go to. ck125 It's ok they will get it next time around (Every time Google does something with a phone). Face it, Google is horrible at product launches/stock with phones. Come on Google. Vega007 Screen, software and camera have to be the three most important things a phone needs to get right, everything else after that is just water under the bridge. And this is why I love my Pixel. Jens Knutson "you're not the customer, you're the product" UGH. Can we *please* retire this lame old chestnut? https://goo.gl/MQ7j26 Very disappointed to see an AP writer using this flawed, populist opinion. The only real problem with the Pixel is that they don't make *nearly* enough of them. That isn't to say it's perfect -- it isn't -- but availability is the only true deal breaker for the masses. (I realize that doesn't mean that people won't have their own individual deal-breakers, especially on a nerd-news site like AP, but don't make the mistake of projecting that onto the mass market. I'm sure the iPhone has some hardware deal-breakers for many AP readers, but that doesn't seem to have held it back either.) whispy_snippet "We the consumers are not Google’s customers." I fundamentally disagree with this. Just because advertisers are Google's customers doesn't mean the regular consumer can't be as well. Google sells a range of hardware products to consumers with varying levels of success. Yes, user data extracted from these devices is very important to Google. But these devices are still physical products being purchased with cash by consumers. This relationship is the same as that of an iPhone purchaser and Apple. The only difference is the product itself. Ryan And youre right. The Nexus was acceptable as a beta becuase it was half priced. At full-price im not buying into a beta. Im not buying a phone with a schizophrenic assistant​, broken bluetooth audio that hasnt been​ resolved in over a year and a garbage messaging platform. If the next Pixel is Nexus priced I'll consider it but goven the current state of the software if I'm paying a premium price im getting a premium phone, the iPhone. Ill start the process with an ipad. After 3 disappointing android tablets im done. So that will really soften the landing when i finally break my 9 year boycott of Apple products. Ian Mitchell Not to mention that you have to be a Verizon customer, which is dumb as hell, unless you buy one unlocked, which is outrageous. Zepid Nonsense. You can finance it just like you would through a carrier or subsidize it through Google's own service. Marcelove @Trevor Newman With Nexus the owners were beta testers of Google's products (me included). We didn't care much about that because the reasons you already wrote here... People now got upset because the experience with Dead Pixel was virtually the same as with Nexus devices, but Google charged a premium price. But at the end, you know who is the responsible? You and every single buyer of a Dead Pixel. So stop whining because you allowed this scenario when you didn't give a f**k when the Nexus program was chopped... You didn't care and happily send hundreds of dollars at Google's way... So man up, stop being a pu**y and accept the fact you are the only one to blame. JD Vote with your wallet, walk away from Google and block them from mining your data David MacKenzie I've had my Pixel since the day it came out in the US. It had been 3 years since I had given the Android world a try. I was overjoyed to finally cast my iPhone aside as the paperweight it was meant to be and get down to customizing my new..."Truely Pure" Google phone. ​Sadly, after 5-months in, I have officially declared the iPhone the more superior of the two. Google did not do a good enough job keeping the fanboys like me happy. The ongoing bugs, the spotty customer service when reaching out and the lack of apology for the bad user experience has left me with a bad taste in my mouth. Where are the damn headphones by the way!? mrjayviper wholeheartedly agree with this article. If I'm paying Apple prices, I might as well get Apple since I know there customer service is topnotch and I can easily go to the hundreds of stores out there. Max Johnson Which is why I ended up getting an iPhone for the first time. JD Me too. Aaron Yeah, top notch. Tell that to all those iPhone 6plus users with the death screen disease and Apple does nothing... mrjayviper Out of warranty? I don't think Google supports out of warranty devices to Aaron You missed the point. Point is, Apple produced a product with a design flaw that affected nearly 40% of the users. They went cheap with a connector to the main board. And if that phone fails at month 13 (even though it is a known flaw, in the Auto industry this would have had a government mandated recall), but Apple with it's top notch customer service tells the consumer to pound sand. I worked retail and it was funny that people could be on their 3rd replacement iPhone with same issues (speakers, mics, button, etc) yet they are okay with that shoddy product. One time an Android fails it's "Android phones are cheap junk).". Smh donkeygoat Welcome Trevor! A good read! I like many, when hearing about the rumblings of the pixel was excited and then disappointed when it was released with the price. I am still kinda confused what the pixel is and where it wants to be. For example, my mate has been disappointed with the pixel's bluetooth. Connection is less reliable and the sound quality isn't as good as what you would expect a 'traditional flagship'. Then he finds out that the pixel doesn't support run of the mill codecs such as aptx. Now the nexus never had aptx and I thought the reasoning for that was because the nexus devices was more a cost effective option for developers. Why would Google waste money on spending licencing fees for aptx when the primary goal was to get the latest 'stock android' into developers hands? The pixel on the other hand is a premium priced phone for consumers - and sure, the there's plan for it in O, but I would argue that it should have been in place from the beginning if the phone was so consumer focused. bekifft Ideally these problems will all be solved when the phone is truly made by Google. It's painfully obvious that this first generation Pixel is just slapped together from the HTC spare parts bin. I look forward to their first REAL first party phone. jawsnnn I'm fine with the Pixel being what it is as phone "zero". But the next version better hit it out of the park in every single way or it is a dead fish to me. James Briano I'm gonna drive my 6P into the ground then check out iPhones. Google's been telling me "wait until next year" since the Galaxy Nexus. Cecil Hardwood You are 100% correct but it is ok. Google users are loyal to a fault and will continue giving the company a pass. Almost every product Google releases is a beta product so people are use to Google falling short. Just look at ChromeBooks. While not made by Google, Google fanboys use them and I have noticed that "Good Enough" is the new mantra because they are cheap (in price). Google has trained their followers to expect less while giving more. Berni Hargrove Hold on now, Chromebooks are more than good enough if you go price for price on a cheap laptop. There's no way that $200 Windows laptop with 2gigs of ram is performing on the same level as a $200 Chromebook with the same specs. In addition the reason why "Good Enough" applies to this is because the average person wants to pay very little for a computer, but have it be "fast and last a long time" to effectively browse and use Office. Anyone here should know, unless you are getting over on someone, the least you should pay for decent laptop is $500, but the amount of times I've had people in Best Buy whine that that's too expensive for them to just be using Office and small tasks is frequent. Google can make good products that are ready for primetime when they don't have their ass or in the clouds, but sadly as their messaging strategy has showed us, that's increasingly uncommon. JD This post echoes all of my feelings. I want to love you Google and I'm willing to compromise. But not with what you want for the Pixel I'm not paying for that privilege to beta test for you and those recent shit decisions you've made Google. Adrian G I couldn't agree more. I've owned every Google phone other than the first. I reluctantly bought the Pixel XL at iPhone matching prices. Same price as the iPhone but no where near the service you get from Apple. To make matters worse, do you know how embarrassing it is when once every few times I try to connect to my chromecast to Netflix but it fails and then my wife's iPhone 6 connects no problem. Why does an iPhone work better with Chromecast than a Google Pixel!!! Michael2011 Google Pixel: Priced like an iPhone​ but without the iPhone support. Google's also continuing to data mine the heck out of the user. No thanks Google. Margaritas Ante Porcos Some of us are simply tired of this game of fighting Google just to be able to use a phone. It's 2017 now. We're supposed to be using normally working Android phones by now and yet Google is still experimenting and "labratting" us. And when it comes to any problem, Google never reacts, leaving us on our own with draining batteries or any other fckps. Maybe it's time for some of us to to go vocations for couple years to an Apple world. Where problems are rare and are fixed like it's Apple's business to take care of customers. I miss Apple. No company screws paying customers like Google does. It's not normal. Roy https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/fef4fa148cb6b5c2f15fcd856ec70e90ed88abb6606e0f6554b4d09654040535.png Max Johnson X-tra Bezel. Eric Marciniak Doesn't help that Best Buy has a giant iPhone 7 ad that literally blocks the pixel display from view right when you walk in haha. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/8283702e9d03a34df4cfb2bd525ea593d0304d3937690392b7b3acc57eb7620e.jpg Berni Hargrove Best Buy is terrible with product placement. Shit literally changes every season if not more. Good luck finding anything remotely niche on your own. lol Jon E. Great article. Just fix the end with "couldn't care less" :) abc My favorite argument from Pixel fanboys is the imaginary tremendous sales that they keep claiming. Obviously, no official figures exist so one must speculate. But the facts are that the Pixel is only sold in 5 countries. That instantly makes it hard to have a phone with insane sales. Now if we presume that those countries are purchasing millions of Pixels, then we have to wonder why we don't see Pixels out in the wild nearly everyday in those countries. Obviously, if you sold millions of devices in a country, you expect to see a lot of those devices in people's hands. But we don't. Berni Hargrove While I agree with a lot of what you said, some of your logic is flawed. Take america for example. There's over 150 million people here. It would take at least 15 million in sales here alone, just to see 1 in 10 people with it. john o’carroll I absolutely love your article! I have suffered the wrath of an extremely poor customer service on project fi and the flawed design of the Nexus 6P. RIP Nexus...Long story short, 5 phones later, all of which had the same problem with the frame and screen separation. Never allowed to return my phone for a refund and ended up leaving project fi and back to T-Mobile. Amazing what brick and mortar stores​ do for a company in keeping their customers happy. Keep up the good work Trevor! Gary The pixel is not a good phone. It has the worst reception of any cell phone that I've ever owned. It has a nice camera though. Insight Spinner I'm a Google fangirl. I admit it. I find this rant lackluster, but just like with Google I'll forgive you diluting the quality of your product in hopes the end result will be superior. I'll forgive you for not actually serving my needs, but rather, focusing on your own in the hours that eventually what you are saying will accidentally have greater benefit to me. Heeyyyy...Wait. Are YOU Google? Welcome! SimonPieman If you live in a big city, and an Apple store is a few blocks away, there might be some merit for this. For me, if I wanted to visit an Apple store, it's a 400 mile trip for a store replacement. Google on the other hand both times have had a posted replacement in my hands within 24 hours. I much prefer Google's model, it's universally suitable for everything, not just city dwellers. C Lo Good first article Trevor. Welcome aboard. Suyash Bansal I liked the article. 🙃 Orjuan Google Pixels customer service is great if you ask me. It takes like a week to get a replacement, not a month. Also, comparing it to the One Plus 3T is unfair, you didn't mention the superior processing and graphical power and the fact that it gets updates for the next 5-8 years. It also features Google Assistant, which is a big selling point. Add all those up and pixel is worth the extra 400. Plus, I got a regular pixel, with a two year protection plan, 128 GB, and it's still cheaper than iPhone. Google Pixel is a commercial and consumer success. Do your research before spouting out shit, all you did was look at the obvious facts and ignored the small stuff that counts. "UGHHHHH, it has a better camera and that's it.". RESEARCH YOUR TOPICS, Google Pixel is $400 more than One Plus 3T because it's better! Orjuan Plus, Nexus was barely Google at all, they just supplied the best version of Android while hiring an OEM to make the parts and design, while slapping their logo on it. Nexus was good, but not Google's essence, it was a startup for Pixel, which is 100% Google. AJZ16 couldn't care less* usamaisawake I had an entire column of pixels that were not working properly. Thing is my Pixel arrived in the first shipment and I had to leave the country so I didn't umbox it until 4 weeks later. When I called to let them know, they were curious why I waited so long and I explained I hadn't turned it on till just then. They didn't give me any trouble with it and exchanged it right away. They sent the new phone and then after I received it I shipped the old back to them. Perhaps this was still early in the release of the phone so they felt more obligated to make sure the experience was good. Phil Rowley My pixel bricked. I thought Google's customer service (along with bestbuy even though I paid for their stupid geek squad) were horrible. I hate to say it but Verizon was the most helpful and luckily I pay for their monthly insurance. Colin Richardson I miss the Nexus line.. Thankfully I can still buy some Nexus 5X phones (not refurbished). But that will not last. I have no idea what I will do for a phone after that.. I want a Stock Android phone, not a Stock Android Flagship phone. Max Johnson There are plenty of stock-like flagship and non-flagship Android phones. HTC, Sony, Moto and OnePlus are all stock based at varying prices. If you want direct update from Google and good customer service that's a different story, I think that's the main thing now, to get the same quality of support as Apple on Android. I'm surprised to get frequently updates from Sony with latest monthly security patches on my X Compact. Micah T "couldn't* care less." Think about it.... Tr3ple I bought a Pixel XL for 370 and I threw my Galaxy S7 edge in the drawer LMAO 😂 oh Happy day. Sammy Phillips 370 USD? or 370 Euro? Tr3ple USD, bought it 220 with a broken screen and fixed it for 150. So I spent 370. Sammy Phillips I definitely prefer Android but iMessage is really nice. It's a ubiquitous rich media messaging platform. I wish they'd bring it to Android. Tr3ple Yeah but to sell me the phone so cheap? I guess lol, I'm not complaining mtz Interesting article however, in the same way Microsoft is not really trying to sell the overpriced Surface Studio , Google is not trying to sell Pixels. Why? Simple. Goole has OEM partners that have supported the Android platform by providing the hardware from the beginning. While it one thing for Google to partner with a carrier each year and release a basic Nexus phone its an entirely different thing for them to release top tier Device and undercut thoes partners on price. Tony Bundy Replied via non-existent really blue Pixel. Yes, wasn't easy but here I am. 😀 Pixel.ization.alism Well precisely Google Blue would be #4285F4 not #4485ED if you would ask. Zuxs13 This was a rather poor opinion piece. You make claims like you can't "easily get a replacement pixel" which is completely untrue. The Apple store is hardly the only place that sells phones and offers good customer service. The OP3T might be readily available, but most consumers have no clue what it is or where to even buy one and would rather buy a phone that is sold at their service provider or local best buy and is supported by 24/hr support service. das "Couldn't care less" - if one *could* care less, than it currently cares. Lindsay Meyer I mentioned this in another thread but feel it probably merits its own post here, coming from the perspective of a disenchanted iPhone user who now owns a Pixel (and is still disenchanted). I've been an Apple user for a long time. Loved the iPhones and loyally stuck by them, albeit with a little less enthusiasm every year after iPhone 4s. I was bored, wanting to venture outside the Apple cycle (which is hard to break once you've spent $$$$$ over the years in apps and compatible Apple devices) and bitter that Apple essentially abandons support of their costly older models and all but forces you to continually upgrade. Also, I was tired of clinging to Apple's old identity as a game changer, seeing as their 7 was a nothing but new shade of lipstick, or worse, new packaging on the same lipstick (and their upgraded iOS just made using the hardware on my 6s buggier and more annoying - using the home button w/ fingerprint ID was enough to make me want to hurl my phone at the ground). SO.. Hubby, a long time member of the opposing Android camp, finally talked me into the Pixel, which is what I have now. I gotta say, aside from the gorgeous camera and the option to stick some widgets on my display, it's kind of a let down. The fact that it was the same cost as an iPhone is, honestly, shocking. Many have said before me, and it's true, that Apple doesn't want the risk of unveiling truly new and innovative features. When Jobs left, there was no one crazy enough to continue to push the envelope and risk failure of Apple's #1 moneymaker, so now Apple excels at what Android (or at least my Pixel) does not - fluid, exceptionally clear and reliable usability and an unfailingly friendly UI, omnipresent support and a $#¡+ ton of amazing, well-supported apps. Other phones, incl my Pixel, will have more innovative features, but Apple with come right behind it and perfect those features. That's what they do now. Still glad I didn't get the iPhone 7; Apple didn't deserve my business, but Pixel has been a disappointment to me thus far. For the price, I'd prefer my husband's Nexus 6. I think he'd prefer his old HTC if it had front-facing speakers lol. I just don't feel there's a lot of good options out there right now that justify the cost. I have given serious thought to trying to find a replacement comparable to the old Sanyo 6100 (yes, that one) and then throwing an iPad or a tablet in my purse. Maybe even that old B&O phone would be fun. I'm just tired of my need for a smartphone to be continually exploited by these inferior products; half the time they break right after the warranty expires, and like an endentured servant, I'm forced into the process all over again. Also, the fact that this Pixel wants to track everything I do scares the bejeezus out of me. I'm sure Apple has done the same thing more covertly for years, but seeing everything I say, type, search, view, read.. not to mention every place I eat at, travel to or shop.. neatly organized into a little packaged profile makes me feel like a product more than ever. Eliminating Google's permissions to track this info also eliminates much of the Pixel's functionality as a smart phone with fluid communication between apps. I should have probably mentioned this first because I absolutely hate that aspect of it. Renee Looker I don't know about anyone else's opinion on the Pixel phone but I have the Pixel XL Blue and have had it since release. I've not had any issues with my phone, absolutely love it. Really quite eager to see what Google will be releasing next, the rumors are on the rise on what's up next. Nicholas Conrad Great article! techieland You and we are the customers when it come to the Pixel and Pixel Xl. And even the late and great Nexus products to some extent. Personally I think the Pixel phones were a fail, Google should have stuck to making reference level phones to ensure the manufacturers understand what the minimum an Android phone is supposed to be like. Samsung and OnePlus obviously gets it but it seems LG, HTC, & Motorola, are struggling despite all 3 being manufacturers of Nexus/AOSP devices. sgtguthrie *couldn't care less James Perry Good article. But it just barely touches the issues at GOOGLE. However, most of the missteps and pratfalls can be attributed to one individual - Sundar Pichai.

Using the refreshed Google Home mobile app, Home owners can train the device to recognize individual voices for everyone in your house. Google says it is able to do this through the use of neural networks. Once properly trained, people will be able to ask Google Home for their daily schedule, preferred news, commute details, and personal playlists. The functionality requires the latest Home app from Google on each associated account. This feature will start rolling out today for Google Home users in the U.S., but will expand to the U.K. in the coming months. Google Home is a $129 in-home connected speaker that relies on the same Google Assistant app found on Android handsets. more info at Google » Related Google Assistant to Live In (Your) Google Home Google today made its Amazon Echo competitor, Google Home, available for preorder.

 Here’s how many people use ad blockers around the world Jeff Dunn Apr. 20, 2017, 4:56 PM 2,194 facebook linkedin twitter email print More Charts   Google will soon announce a built-in ad blocking tool for its Chrome web browser, according to a report from The Wall Street Journal. At first, that seems a bit odd. Digital advertising is Google’s bread and butter, and reports say that Google Chrome is still by far the world’s most-used browser. So why would Google want to handicap itself? Well, in the long run, it may not be. The report says Google’s tool wouldn’t kill every ad, but would instead filter out “unacceptable” ads as defined by the Coalition for Better Ads, an industry group of which Google (and Facebook, the other digital ad giant) are members. The Coalition currently names auto-playing videos with sound, large ads that stick to your web page even as you scroll, prestitial ads with countdowns (i.e., those ads that make you wait a few seconds before letting you see the page), and pop-ups as examples. So, in a sense, this may be Google’s attempt at getting other publishers and advertisers to do better, which would lessen the need for an ad blocker, which would mean more money in Google’s pocket. How harshly Google will treat “offending” websites is still up in the air, but as this chart from Statista shows, it’s dealing with a not-insignificant amount of ad-blocking users around the world. According to a recent PageFair report, those figures are only growing. The hangup is that none of this is likely to include Google’s own ads. And regardless of how bad some ads may be, Google could still end up leveraging its own dominant platform (Chrome) to not only shut out competing ad-blockers, but strong-arm other advertisers into following its orders. If the report comes to fruition, Google is likely to face careful scrutiny from regulators. Mike Nudelman/Business Insider/Statista Get the latest Google stock price here.

The security patch appears to be the only thing in this update package. The patch contains a grand total of 49 security fixes from Google, as well as 16 Galaxy-specific fixes from Samsung, though the patch notes don’t say exactly what those Galaxy-specific fixes are. The update isn’t a terribly large download, and will bring the build number of Galaxy S8+ units that take it up to G955FXXU1AQDD. While Samsung may not be revealing exactly what’s in this update as far as Galaxy-specific fixes, those who want to know what’s been patched up on Google’s side are free to look over the update notes about April’s patch right at the source, being Google themselves. According to them, there are no less than six critical level fixes in this patch, as well as fixes for privilege escalation bugs in essential Android core services like SurfaceFlinger, AudioServer, and CameraBase. Of the 49 total fixes to be found, a whopping 15 of the security fixes are either high or critical level. Some of the critical fixes are for bugs that were reported to Google as far back as December of 2016. To put it bluntly, this is a very important security patch. The patch is rolling out in stages across Europe. Reportedly, users in Belgium and Germany are already getting the update, meaning that it should be rolling out across all of Europe in the next few days or weeks at most. Given the extremely slight differences between the Galaxy S8+ and its smaller sibling, it’s surprising that there’s no word yet on when the vanilla Galaxy S8 will see this patch in Europe. That can be said doubly so because this is a mere security patch; not a lot is changing, functionally. The two phones share the same software, so even if there was some sort of user-facing or deep-level change, it could theoretically be implemented just as easily on the S8 as on the S8 Plus.

Internet by Ian Sherr April 20, 2017 1:33 PM PDT @iansherr Google's logo. Google We know governments send requests to Google for our data. We know they sometimes get a court order, and they've even done so secretly. And though Google puts out a semiannual transparency report giving us a broad sense of how often governments are asking to access private data of its users, Google says a new problem has cropped up: The number of requests from governments outside the US is growing. In fact, Google said the more than 45,000 requests it received in the second half of last year were the most ever, and that over 31,000 of those requests came from outside the US. "This volume underscores the need for an improved international framework that meets legitimate law enforcement needs and ensures high standards of due process, privacy and human rights," Kent Walker, Google's senior vice president and general counsel, wrote in a blog post. "Without better and faster ways to collect cross-border evidence, countries will be tempted to take unilateral actions to deal with a fundamentally multilateral problem."

Like a pro LG G6 review - - - Google Home now supports up to six different users Post your comment Comments (3) Vlad 20 April 2017 Google Misc Almost ten days ago we told you that multi-user support coming to the Google Home was inevitable. The only question, back then, was when we'd see this introduced. It turns out the answer is: today. Google has announced that its smart speaker with a virtual assistant built-in has gained support for up to six separate people. So when you ask it about your day, it will deliver information tailored to you, but when your significant other asks, they will receive stuff that's relevant to them. To do this, Google Home distinguishes between different voices. Basically, it 'knows' who's asking it stuff, and thus it answers accordingly. For this to work, every one of those six users needs to train the device, by saying "OK Google" and "Hey Google" two times each. The way each person says those phrases is analyzed by a neural network, which detects certain characteristics in human voices. After you train it, anytime you utter one of the activation phrases, the neural network will compare the sound to its previous analysis, so it can understand if it's you speaking or not. The comparison takes place inside your Google Home, in a matter of milliseconds. The feature is rolling out today in the US, and will be available in the UK "in the coming months". To get started, you need to look inside the newest version of the Google Home mobile app for a card that says "multi-user is available". Then you teach the Google Assistant to recognize you, as described above. Finally you set up your preferences, in the app, for some features like personalized music and commute info.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile  ⋮  Software  ⋮  Web Google Might Bring Its Default Ad-Blocking Feature for Chrome Browser By Zara Ali 15 hours ago 25Shares Share Tweet Submit Google Chrome might finally get the ad-blocking feature for its the mobile and desktop versions. The news comes from inside sources at Google Inc. Not that we have not been enjoying ad-blocks, thanks to ad-block extensions on Chrome Store. But a default ad-blocker by Chrome would be a welcome addition. The feature would come enabled by default within Chrome, and it would keep out specific types of online advertisements that are bad redirects and open in multiple videos on one click. There are chances that Google might announce this feature within a few weeks, but it is still working on a few aspects and is in the deciding phase whether to go ahead with it. Related Chrome 58 Rolling Out to Mac, Windows, & Linux, Lacks Touch Bar Support for MacBook Pro Kind of ads to get filtered with this ad-blocker would be the ones who come under Coalition for Better Ads, which is an industry group that released a list of ad standards in March. These standards circle out the advertisements formats like pop-ups, auto-playing video ads with sound, ads with countdown timers. Such ads are regarded to be “beneath a threshold of consumer acceptability.” The tech giant is also considering to block all the ads that appear in collaboration with offensive ads. In this way, it is planning to target a group of ads rather than individual ads. Website owners would be required to make sure of the quality of the ads or Google will block all the ads. Advertisement On the contrary, the ad-blocking policy on Chrome seems like overkill for Google as its revenue model depends on advertising as well. The demand for extension-based Chrome extension has grown manifold in recent years. In the US alone, 26% users are using ad-blocking software. Now, Google seems to be interested in tapping the growth of ad-block tools. According to the analytics firm StatCounter, Chrome has nearly 47.5% share of the browser market across all the platforms. Google is already a part of an “Acceptable Ads” program, which is run by software company Eyeo GmbH. The same company is behind the famous ad-blocking tool Adblock Plus. Google’s partnership with the program is the reason why some of the ads on Google are allowed to go through Adblock Plus on Chrome. Related Google Accidentally Releases a “Confidential Internal Only” Update to Pixel XL It remains to be seen if Google goes ahead with its decision. If it does, then we wonder what will happen to all the other ad-blocking tools for Chrome.

An update coming out Thursday will enable Home’s built-in assistant to learn the different voices of up to six people, although they can’t all be talking to the internet-connected speaker at the same time. Distinguishing voices will allow Home to be more personal in some of its responses, depending on who triggers the assistant with the phrase, “OK Google” or “Hey Google.” For instance, once Home is trained to recognize a user named Joe, the assistant will automatically be able to tell him what traffic is like on his commute, list events on his daily calendar or even play his favorite songs. Then another user named Jane could get similar information from Home, but customized for her. The ability to distinguish voices may help Home siphon sales from Amazon.com’s Echo, a competing product that features its own voice-activated assistant, Alexa. The Echo doesn’t yet recognize different voices, so Alexa can’t retrieve more personal information for different accounts. Google’s voice-distinction feature, however, won’t prevent unauthorized users from activating the assistant, as long as Home’s microphone is turned on. That loophole allowed Burger King to recently air a commercial that included the phrase “OK Google” to prompt Home’s assistant to recite the ingredients of the fast-food restaurant’s burger from a Wikipedia entry. Google quickly blocked Burger King’s commercial from toying with the Home assistant, but the marketing stunt illustrated how the technology can be manipulated. Voice-personalization eventually could enable Home’s users to block others from accessing the device, but Google isn’t ready to do that yet. “It’s important to balance making sure the assistant on Google Home is still useful and able to answer a guest’s or friend’s question while also answering a few specific questions just for you,” Google spokeswoman Kara Stockton said. The voice-distinction feature also isn’t being offered for the same digital assistant that operates on Google’s Pixel phone and other smartphones running on the latest version of its Android software. Google doesn’t think the technology is necessary on phones because most of those devices are password-protected and are usually used by just one person.

We’d like to take this time to sit back and reminisce on our fond, and large, memories of the device. Death, however, is not the end, but a new beginning. Or, at least, an excuse for those of us without upgrade fever to move ourselves over to a nice and shiny new ROM. While Google may have given up on Shamu, some devices just can’t stay down. And there are a few different flavors for your favorite fish out there. Free Willy, or what now to do with your Shamu? We all know what is dead may never die (as long as your kernel sources oblige), but I’m going to operate under the premise that we’ve all made it past denial and bargaining and into acceptance on the sad but inevitable fate of Shamu. Fortunately there are a some options for software going forward detailed below, and it's worth taking the time to sit down and consider exactly what you want and need. An important aside, this should be an informed decision. Installing any other operating systems on your Nexus device will potentially void your (probably already expired) warranty, and the process required to do so can result in a dead device if you make any significant mistakes. Additionally, the security of your device might be more easily compromised, and as a result of that potential liability a number of developers of applications (such as mobile banking apps and some games) do their best to block such devices from using their applications. As a general note you should be aware that camera support can be poor in many ROMs for many devices, as a result of missing binaries. The Nexus 6 doesn't use any closed binaries for the camera, so that's not a significant concern here, but it's worth keeping in mind if you're looking at this list for another device or decide you want to stick with a ROM you like when you move to a new one. Unlocking your bootloader, installing a ROM or custom recovery (and rooting, if that's your preference) are all things that should only be done when you understand the steps involved and the risks associated. Remember: a bricked device isn’t the worst case scenario, the really bad things just start there. Unfortunately, as Google's base AOSP has gotten better and added more of the type of features people used to use ROMs for, fewer new basic features have been wanted by the sort of power-users that spearhead ROM development. A lot of the old projects have fallen by the wayside. LineageOS For those who haven’t followed things, LineageOS is the continuation of the popular CyanogenMod Android ROM, and that is a long and storied history in all regards. It’s been around in commercial and noncommercial forms since 2009, and although its most up-to-date releases (based on Android 7.1.1) are labeled as nightlies they are (mostly) stable. It’s basically a "stock+" ROM based on a blend of the CAF sources released by Qualcomm and Google’s AOSP (the Android Open Source Project handled by Google), but it does have a lot of extra features added in. For those hoping to hang onto their devices for a couple of years while still reaping the benefits of monthly security updates, LineageOS is probably your best bet, and my personal recommendation. Download. The Good Features At this point the LineageOS devs know pretty well what features to include and ignore. They aren't as heavy-handed as some other groups are with their changes, and most of the stuff you'll find is fairly basic. They've got their own launcher, EQ, a filesystem explorer, and basic modifications to things like notifications, battery icons, and reboot menus. Nothing too over the top. Updates LineageOS gets nightly builds (that are actually weekly builds, called nightlies), and usually gets updated to the latest released version of Android after only a short delay. Support Everyone uses LineageOS, so if you run into an issue, odds are someone else has and you'll find a solution or be more likely to get help. Device Selection Incredibly huge list of supported devices. If you decide you like LineageOS and want to use it on your next phone or tablet, it's very likely to be supported. The Not So Good Features Compared to some of the others on this list LineageOS is comparatively bare-bones, which could be a con. AOSPA (Mostly Dead) AOSPA, now mostly dead, used to go by the name Paranoid Android and has a shorter history than some of the other ROMs here. Their release schedule has also slowed down (read: stopped) quite a bit since OnePlus hired a few of the developers. As a result the latest release they have available for Shamu is fairly old, sitting at 6.0.3. For perspective it’s worth noting that 6.0 (Marshmallow) originally came out in 2015, and even then the AOSPA release didn't land until mid 2016. For the security conscious or those wanting to run the latest versions, the probable lack of future support and no regular build schedule or nightly release is a significant impediment, but AOSPA has a reputation of stability and an excellent feature set, and historically they were on the bleeding edge of interesting new features and modifications for stock Android. Maybe they will be again, someday. Download. The Good Features Pretty basic, which can be a plus for beginners. As with every ROM you'll get some nice new features, all the basics like battery icons, reboot menus, status bar/notification customization, etc. Nothing too intense. Stability They don't do nightlies, each release is intended to be stable. Themes It's got the old CyanogenMod Theme Engine, which means you've got a huge selection. Device Selection Not as expansive as LineageOS, but most Nexus and OnePlus devices are supported, as well as a handful of other easily unlocked devices. The Not So Good Probably Dead No updates in almost a year, but they could come back. Out of Date Current build is really pretty old, only 6.0.3. Features Pretty light on modifications these days, which can be a con if you decide you dig tweaks. Pure Nexus Project The Pure Nexus Project is only a few years old, but it’s become one of the most popular AOSP-based (based on Google’s open-source android code) distributions for turning phones into faux Nexus/Pixel devices, and is especially popular in regards to the Nexus 6. It is currently sitting at Android 7.1.1, and has a good record of receiving regular updates in the past. But it is worth keeping in mind that, although it's quite popular now, compared to LineageOS or AOSPA in its heyday it is a smaller project. Download. The Good Low-budget Pixel If you want one, but don't want to pay the price, you can get close. Pure Nexus takes a very Googly approach to their design, porting over a hand-full of features from Pixel devices that you won't see on many other ROMs, like Pixel-style software keys, the Pixel launcher, and pixel-stock GApps. Features In addition to the Pixel changes you also get all the regular ROM tweaks you'd expect like notification tray customization, battery icons, notification light control, etc. Themes One of the few large 7.x ROMs with current theme support via substratum. Volume Control Pre 7.x-type volume controls options. The Not So Good Device Support As the name suggests, their primary development is for Pixel/Nexus devices, although there are some unofficial builds about for others. OmniROM OmniROM is one of the older ones. Created when Cyanogen took things commercial, it historically takes the old-school CM approach to ROM building: whatever fits. They even helped pioneer early multi-window efforts. It's got an AOSP base and a lot of unique features, but it also takes a bit more of a customized kitchen-sink approach to things. That method of including every possible feature can be overwhelming if you're new to ROMs, but it does offer an unarguable degree of customization. Download. The Good Updates Nightlies! Features Want to customize the precise sensitivity of the Flick2Wake gesture? A Launcher with adjustable grids and hotwords? the OmniSwitch recents menu? If an omelet, for you, is an exercise in fitting your entire fridge inside a pan, you'll like OmniROM. And, of course, it's got all the basic changes you'd expect, too. Updates Omni sometimes sees updates faster than LineageOS, even. Device Selection OmniROM supports a good number of devices The Not So Good Not For the Faint of Heart Not necessarily a con, but OmniROM has a whole lot going on. (Or, on the plus, it has a whole lot going on.) Dirty Unicorns Dirty Unicorns is old, originally based on AOKP (my all-time favorite historical ROM) but now usually an AOSP/CAF base. It has a slim but still solid number of supported devices, two lines of their own GAPPS packages (which is kind of insane), and its famous "Dirty-Tweaks." If you thought OmniROM had a lot going on, Dirty Unicorn takes things even further. These guys are prolific and communicative developers, and Dirty Unicorns is probably my 2nd favorite ROM these days behind LineageOS. Just like OmniROM, though, it can be overwhelming for newcomers used to sailing stock on their Shamu. Download. The Good Features Changes abound, there's a whole lot to customize. In addition to all the basics you'd expect mentioned above you've got a ton of changes, even basic device interaction methods like the nav bar present new options for things like gestures. And it inherits OmniROM's OmniSwitch option. Even more nice, navigating all the options in Dirty Unicorns isn't actually too difficult with their famous Dirty-Tweaks settings pane. Themes One of the few, if that's your thing. Substratum based. Updates It might not have nightlies, but it gets updated fairly frequently. However, expect a larger delay at major version releases compared to OmniROM or LineageOS. Device Selection Most of the devices on this list are the sort of devices you want if you're into ROMs anyway. The Not So Good Not For the Faint of Heart Not necessarily a con, but Dirty Unicorns, like OmniROM, has a whole lot going on. (Or, on the plus, it has a whole lot going on.) Etc. There are plenty of other distributions available for the Nexus 6 worthy of note, like Bliss ROM's builds and Ressurection Remix, but many of them are a bit less focused on general use, less frequently updated, or unofficial and unsupported individual projects. For the truly adventurous, however, the options are there, and some have very interesting or unique features. But, be fully prepared for home-made ROMs to have weird bugs, include potential privacy concerns, or to end development at inconvenient times. Spring, Summer, Fall, Dead Nexus Shamu may have reached Autumn in Google's eyes, but it doesn't have to in our hearts. Thankfully you have some choices to make when you're finally ready to put it down and move on. Although, I don't think anyone would blame you for making eyes at a Pixel XL. Again, be sure that you're willing to handle the responsibility and risks involved. I recommend doing things the right (read: long) way. One-click solutions, auto-rooters, and toolboxes should be avoided. If learning to use CMD or bash scares you, you might be better off consigning your Shamu to his watery grave, and instead just buying a new phone. There are resources out there for collaborative help when you need it at places like XDA or reddit, but if you don't know how to pull a log or use ADB and fastboot you're not going to find a lot of sympathy. Education, as always, is key. And, frankly, ADB and fastboot aren't too difficult to learn to use. Update April 8, 2017: The story was revised, camera warnings made more specific and moved to the top, and more feature details and two more ROMs added at readers' requests.

Thanks. Gordon Spurgeon Spooner I would say OmniROM. https://forum.xda-developers.com/nexus-9/orig-development/omnirom-pre-weeklies-flounder-t3537414 buxbaum3055 Dirty Unicorns is working fine on mine 7-down PA is a poor excuse of a ROM. They make big announcements and then leave people hanging for years just to come back with promises that they can't keep. P.S. That cover image is awesome! David Ruddock Yeah, we included it because, really, it's one of the few "proper" ROMs still out there for the N6 aside from Lineage and PNP. It's probably pretty stable and maybe some PA fans could still want some PA-specific features. Also, rare possibility somebody doesn't want to up to Nougat, I guess. Devin Rodriguez Truly a whale of a photoshop. Ryne Hager PA's future (or lack thereof) makes me sad, I hope they push some updates. Michael Weisberg Have you....used a Nexus 6 recently? Camera performance on this phone is notoriously bad, so most custom ROMs probably have BETTER camera performance than stock. Also, why would you recommend a Marshmallow ROM that isn't being developed anymore? Kenneth Porter I think he was just trying to give the lay of the land as opposed to recommending mx3 "Unsupported: the best Nexus 6 ROMs to check out in a post-update world" Devin Rodriguez It's out of date for sure, but it's still a good ROM. Jesse Lee No... no it's not, that's the point. It WAS a good ROM, on devices pre N6. What's the title of the article again.

Per the article in regards to Lineage "my personal recommendation" Ryne Hager Yeah, the camera is pretty terrible, but even so I figured if anyone used this to make a decision about another device it was worth including. Tim R. NX Camera makes it bearable again. But it will be a lovely day when I can upgrade to something with a better camera. operator207 To give a real world example of camera performance; I have PureNexus (7.1.1) on my N6. I took a picture with "auto flash" turned on, in a dark room, and the flash didn't go off. I assumed the picture would be a black nothing. It wasn't. I could see the difference between the black leather couch, the dark blue blanket and the dark brown cat laying on the blanket. It was MUCH better than I thought it would be. I could not see squat in the view finder when I took the picture, it was a black blob. Running the stock rom for the N6 (MM 6.0.1 was the last version I ran) the flash would have needed to be used, or if it hadn't, the picture would have been horrible. Gordon Spurgeon Spooner I'm a big fan of OmniROM. It doesn't get the attention of some of the others, but it's been stable for me, and gets great battery life. https://forum.xda-developers.com/nexus-6/orig-development/rom-omni-rom-t2968425 Ryne Hager Omni info is up! balthazar Omni is really great. More people should check it out Marty I just use LineageOS on my N6. But whatever you do, don't go to the LineageOS Reddit forum and ask about support for any device not already listed....lol. It's an unforgivable sin and you will face wrath. 😉 Carson Saldanha Bet you've had personal experience in that, haven't you? 😂 Marty It's how I know the flavor of wrath it brings...lol keithzg But whatever you do, don't go to the LineageOS Reddit forum FTFY ;) Davin Peterson LineageOS is available several older unsupported Nexus devices such as the 2013 Nexus 7. It works well on my 2013 Nexus 7. h4rr4r There are unofficial builds for even the 2012 N7. I have one at the office that works ok. Ernie Manning Been on Pure Nexus since I found out the developer was making ROMs for it. (He was making ROMs for the Note 2 previously as well) I have tried other ROMs but keep coming back to it as it is the most stable. Carson Saldanha How close is the UI to stock? I just want a ROM that's up-to-date and stock. T4rd It's just like using a Pixel, basically. Doesn't get much more stock than that. Carson Saldanha Sweet, do you recommend it over Lineage OS? T4rd I can't personally speak towards Lineage, as I've never used it. Because the last year I've been running Pure Nexus ROM on my 6P, it hasn't given me any reason to try another ROM. Carson Saldanha Ok, thanks man. 👌 Ernie Manning I would recommend over any ROM. If you look on the XDA Developers page for it you can see it has the most users. Kyle Lyles 100% in agreement with you. Jesse Lee Ahhh... it's Pure Nexus, says it all. (Pure Pixel technically now) robert lemons jr Man where is Dirty Unicorns? Ryne Hager I'll def add Dirty Unicorns, expect it. Grojnak Yeah!! DU is the best ROM out there ddevito I love my Op3 in every way, but I do miss my Shamu's screen. I also miss how legendary it felt in my hands, it was a well designed tank. Marty I bet you had a hard time carrying it, though...as little as you are. 😋 Ryne Hager Shamu nestled so nice in the palm. But I definitely don't miss the inaccurate colors on it, way over-saturated. The OP3 has that sweet sweet sRGB calibrated mode. Jamiejkrebs Google is paying $97 per hour!

R Firestone ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ Some one yesterday was reporting Nexus 6 getting Android O was confirmed by Google. waloody88 i also read it, but it was from just one source. probably fake. Carson Saldanha #fakenews Suicide_Note It's not, and it wasn't. someone755 You mention Pure Nexus and RR but no Carbon or Omni. Great work, you just lost any credibility in regards to custom ROMs. marcusmarcus2 http://www.reactiongifs.us/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/frowny_face_supernatural.gif someone755 Make jokes all you want, but when you're done I'd advise you to read up on RR and PN. marcusmarcus2 I'll never be done but http://i.imgur.com/xpk30mU.gif Nate What's wrong with PN someone seems a little salty, David said the scope of the article was near stock experience... marcusmarcus2 The article even says "the options are there" with a link to a ton of different ROMs for it. Going through the list, I see Carbon and OMNI ROMs. So he covered it well enough. Alex Cruz Yeah I want to know what exactly is wrong with PN. I mean I could see the knock on RR but if we're talking about near stock experience, I don't see the beef there with PN. Not unless you're a salty mofo because you're on a zombie ROM (Carbon) Ryne Hager Omni isn't bad, but it can be a bit kitchen sink and I've had some stability issues with it in the past. However, that's a legit point, I'll add Omni in. Carson Saldanha For a new writer, you're getting quite the bit of harsh criticism. Sucks. 🤷‍♂️ Devin Rodriguez He can take it. He's a strong independent writer who don't need no comments! marcusmarcus2 That's right. Plus he seems very responsive in the comments anyway, not taking any of the comments poorly. Hey @ryne_hager:disqus https://media.tenor.co/images/d1bcd7be62c1f27d4e6978ad3cd2ab29/tenor.gif Devin Rodriguez I like you with the gifs, and all from Supernatural I just realized. marcusmarcus2 Well shucks http://i1255.photobucket.com/albums/hh640/mimajki/Feedback%20gifs%202/tumblr_m42wgjg6E11qgtbrgo7_r2_250.gif Miku is Best Vocaloid You missed "sassy". Devin Rodriguez By gum you are right! Edited! Ryne Hager No worries, that's part of how it works. And really, I should have included Omni, it was an oversight that was later supplemented. Really, I'm just happy to get to work on stuff I enjoy. Biff Wonsley Probably outside the scope of this offering, but you can also get some extra functionality & options using alternative kernels. Kyle Lyles Pure Nexus with Franco's kernel is an excellent combo. 11 hrs of decent use on my N6 Knowledgeborn Allah RIP to the Nexus 6... Kyle Lyles Nothing out there that makes me want to migrate elsewhere. I'm likely to go to an iPhone 8+ after 9 yrs with Android and 8 yrs with Palm before that.Yeah, yeah, yeah, I've heard it all... Knowledgeborn Allah Honestly, I don't think there's anything wrong with that. I spent 6 years on Android, primarily with Nexus devices, and last year I bought an iPhone 7+. Now, I still like Android, and I have a Pixel XL, which is a decent device; but I'd say that getting an iPhone was one of the best decisions I've made. I'm not saying the iPhone changed my life or anything (LOL), but it's turned out to be the best smartphone I've ever purchased. There's nothing wrong with checking out other stuff, and if you like it, use it. Fanboyism is played out. Тарас Мукин PureNexus is the best choice, I think. I use it on my Xiaomi as well and I love how I don't have to deal with all the stuff like GApps, kernels, theme (I love Pixel's blue), setting up or updating. Maybe it is not the best in all the aspects, but it is easy and it works. Carson Saldanha Could you define "not the best in all the aspects"? What's the cons you've experienced? Тарас Мукин I mean some small stuff. Additional customization options are basic, some ROMs can offer bizzare levels if changing everything. Some other ROMs (or other kernels) can squeeze out more battery life. Others sacrifice all that to bring speed. And some people want some of this stuff. But it always comes with a price of stability and simplicity of installation — so I prefer PireNexus. For example my previous ROM had "snartbar" instead of regular navbar. Different animations for button pressing, gesture mode (1 button and swipes), themes for other stuff — but 1 in 10 apps didn't understand it. Telegram was just breaking on some screens with this "smartbar", and buttons weren't even pressing correctly a lot of times. Now I have simple Pixel navbar — but it freaking works. Carson Saldanha Thanks for the info man! 👌 T4rd Indeed, I've been running Pure Nexus ROM on my 6P for the last year I've had it and couldn't ask for any more in a ROM. Performance, stability, and battery life are as good, if not better than stock, and the additional tweaks and options are pretty nice. Carson Saldanha Guys, LineageOS or Pure Nexus Project? I want something that's up-to-date and as close to stock as possible, but I also want it stable. Which do you recommend for my N6? Suicide_Note Pure Nexus Trav Montana I still have mine , jumped to the 6P last October and been happy with ever since. At first tho I did miss the buig screen size but got use to the slightly smaller screen. On a side note I really wished Google would've came out with bigger Nexus 5 since that was my favorite Nexus phone til date :( iFeign I'm hoping somebody creates a ROM like Fake Nexus for the N4, which is just compiled from source and can be sideloaded like an official OTA. Devin Rodriguez ITT: People are upset about their ROM of choice not being mentioned. Alex Cruz OnePlus 3T is the best! magnamentis i'm quite sure that you did not run so many of the roms you mentioned yourself recently and none of the unmentioned. i on the other hand have used all the roms you've mentioned and a few more and can definitely not agree with almost anything in your article and that's quite rare. i really like to comment on good stuff as some of your fellow authors know but this is no seriously and thorougly elvaluated. to recommend lineage which is the base for most other custom roms means that any stable custom rom that is based on linage but has more and at times very useful features is better than lineage because it has all that lineage has + what i said. the best maintained over the last few years, most devices as well as dedicated core team that brings the base to a stable state (including add-ons) often within no time and that is clearly ResurrectionRemix and before the heads left bliss, bliss was once on par for one season. mentioning a dead (for long) rom on second position is ( won't say but nothing good comes to my mind and they failed dearly on Oneplus development as well ) however i have no fixed preference but after using dozens of roms on dozens of devices and at a very sophisticated and loaded level, including xposed and the likes before nougat, i can say that over the last 4 years i switched on device after another (currently 6 active) to RR, always keeping an eye on alternatives and cataclysm for N5 and N6 was king. Steven Murphy WTF no OmniROM mention???? jibust Another vote for OmniROM. Truly the most stable of the 7.1.1 roms. Ryne Hager Legit omission on my part, it's added. Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) I'd suggest a ROM like Dirty Unicorns...you'll get Android 7.1.2 :) Ryne Hager Hey now, we've got kids here. Don't tempt them with that, they're liable to become ROM crazed monsters if you start them out on the hard stuff. Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) Tempt them with what ? ^^ A nice ROM ? Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) DU is AOSP based btw :) Ryne Hager Did they cut the CAF inherited from OMNI? Ryne Hager Yup, looks like the switched to CAF from Omni on L, I'll correct. YaKillaCJ Lol Dirty Unicorn and Resurrection Remix are definitely on the hard end. For us who been at this a long time, we embrace cutting edge options. For the newbie, they definitely could get overwhelmed. balthazar Where is Slim btw? Alex Cruz Oh look another Zombie ROM! Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) A ROM that stole Substratum doesnt deserve a spot on the list :) balthazar oh, is that still going on? I thought things have been settled? Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) Its been settled...but they still did it you know :) balthazar I don't know what they do or don't do as I don't use Slim. If everything's settled there shouldn't be any more hard feelings, you know Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) Well when someone said that they stole it they denied it and said that they wrote it themselves...they are shamelss liars :) balthazar Well this sucks lol 30014 When I was a kid watching free willy, the scene this post is riffing on brought tears to my eyes. When the Michael Jackson song started playing I really felt it. keithzg I'm just going to take this opportunity to lament that the phones Google has released since have had progressively smaller displays. Hell, the Pixel XL is small enough screen-wise that if my 6P dies and I have to upgrade to it I might end up carrying a tablet around again! If only the 6 had had a fingerprint scanner where they originally intended, and the camera hadn't been so goddamn slow, I would have been sorely tempted to fork out for a replacement screen rather than just slapping a screen protector on it when it cracked and giving it to my flatmate whose Nexus 5 finally gave up the ghost (well, stopped being able to use the cellular radio, which made it just a very small wifi tablet, heh). Suicide_Note Early rumors suggest the next Pixel XL, codenamed Muskie, may be bigger than the current XL. There's also the device 'Taimen' that's bigger still, but no one knows if it's a larger display phone a'la the S8+, or if it's a new tablet. Bewear It's nice to see you guys giving custom ROMs some love :) Ryne Hager Oh my god it's a Pokemon. Bewear Well, it happens that we can install custom ROMs too. Geoff Johnson I would disagree with the camera. On phones from Samsung, LG, HTC, etc. that have their own camera software, there usually is a large difference in camera performance, but on stock Android phones like Nexus/Google, there is rarely any negative difference regarding the camera. Ryne Hager For the N6 you are exactly right. And for other devices it depends on whether they use any closed-source secret sauce to parse photos. I really just wanted to include the mention of it, since it does have an effect on devices using closed binaries, for anyone who might use this outside it's intended Shamu-related purpose. Indefinite Implosion Anyone know the best nexus-like ROM for Nexus 4 now that fake nexus has stopped being updated? DanSan Still rocking my Nexus 6… I hate to see it go but its age is definitely showing. Apps are slow as hell, camera is horrible too. Really wish they'd make a new version just like it but looks like I'm switching to the GS8+ Ryne Hager Man, have you seen the screen on that thing? 1000 nits and all those calibrated color spaces, it's super exciting. DanSan Oh hell yeah I did. I fell in love. Got to play with them the day after it was announced. Samsung rep at Best buy let me have fun before he put them on display https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/22f6785bd8af78d427f6eb1464b6114bb93a161258becc9c5becd893436fe11f.jpg Ryne Hager Man, I'd be all over one of those, but I'm a junkie for easily unlocked bootloaders. Plus, that price is painful. Grojnak You say about Dirty Unicorns: "However, expect a larger delay at major version releases compared to OmniROM or LineageOS." Well, today they released their version 11.3, based on Android 7.1.2, only 4 days after Google. Any other rom (neither your beloved Lineage) did that. tehboogieman Can I suggest doing a similar article for Hammerhead? pointman_12 pure nexus is a great rom...i was on chroma until the dev stopped supporting it...glad PN is around...will use my N6 until it dies or PN is gone...i'm cheap... JustAnotherG Meh, GZR ROMs ignored while PA is included? Tipsy, Tesla and Validus are all up to date and updated regularly, and all are full OMS, stop showing favoritism, Android Police. Char G Dn Bro a bricked device isn’t the worst case scenario, the really bad things just start there. This line is funny to me. I totally agree with it to just the other day I went to update my phone ROM and accidentally wiped internal memory along with everything else. I had never done that before. It was quite the adventure learning how to fix that one. Kyle Lyles Almost impossible to truly brick an Android. I've tried every way possible, couldn't do it. SVTCobra Really only happens to developers trying to hack around things like locked bootloaders. They do a good job of releasing relatively safe software. YaKillaCJ Oh it's possible with locked down devices. These devices tend to need backdoors just to get access to certain partitions. Power failure or the wrong command can force the need to take the device apart and/or a special cable. Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) Impossible to brick a Nexus device yes....any other devices like Samsung with their Stupid Knox are easy to brick PhantomGamers I managed to brick my N6 by fastboot flashing the latest update, making sure it boots, and then locking my bootloader which then caused me to bootloop when starting. Tried everything to unbrick it, but couldn't reunlock it because it required me to toggle a setting in developer options which would have required it to boot in the first place. I guess pro tip would be to always wipe data FIRST and then confirm it boots before relocking bootloader. TomCos My N6 is almost as unusable as my N4 was after 3 years. Not sure I really understand why either.... Kyle Lyles And what makes it unusable? operator207 If it was like mine, it needed a full wipe and load of a ROM. If I had not done that, I would feel the same way. It was slow and sluggish before the wipe. I moved to PN, but I am sure if I had reloaded a stock ROM, it would have been peppy too. Also, I have heard that if you just upgrade from one major revision to the next (6.x -> 7.x) you can have slowness as well. TomCos My N6 and N4 both have an unbelievable lagg in the display. Sometimes it can take up to 10 seconds for the gui to reply to input. Same story on both devices, latest OS. Jesse Lee AOSPA... seriously? Lost credibility immediately throwing that in here at all. GZR, Nitrogen, AOSiP, Cyanide, list goes on and on before mentioning PA in the same sentence with N6. Dan Gwinn Do these alternate ROMs fully support Project Fi? Kevin Vesga Pure Nexus does afaik. Other ROMs could work too. You just need to make sure you have Project Fi and Google Connectivity Services installed as system apps. Tamil Not entirely relevant to this article, but the best custom ROM experience I got was with my Nexus 5, and the ROM was developed by psychopompos. Tried a hell lot of custom ROMs with different nexuses, but that guy was awesome, he developed a super smooth, stable ROM that even put the stock ROM into shame. Too bad that he chose a different driection. There always be different developers who do phenomenal job on building ROMs and may not get the attention they deserve. So, it is in a way crude to list out a few ROMs and get the attention only to them. I don't say those ROMs are bad, infact I'm using purenexus in my 6p, but quite a lot of users may think like these are their only options, which is not fair IMO. Anyways, talking about customs ROMs in AP, it's a good head start, may be you can start a section like ROM of the week or ROM of the month or conduct polls for favourite ROMs, that may help a few good developers to come into notice. RNTMPX It's the most beautiful Nexus phone ever build! I think that's the way a phone should looks like. A phone for MENS! Roh_Mish I remember KitKat AOSPA 4.99RC2. the most stable ROM I'd had on my nexus 4. Chris sorry. just to clarify, will Lineage roll out a stable 7.1.2 ROM for nexus 6? It's kind of hard to believe that Google rolled it out then downgraded everyone instead of supporting their device. I was looking into LiquidSmooth (maybe called LiquidDark now) awhile back but it looks like it's stopped development. Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) If you want 7.1.2 better switch the ROM :) Anthony Marz Should have mentioned nitrogen os. I use it on my 5 yo Nexus 4 mako and aside from the hardware, my Nexus 4 is a pixel EowynCarter I don't really want to mess up with custom ROM again. I liked the 'just works' :( Is there a rim that works like the stock rom? Install, and then one click OTA? Max Johnson Lineage OS probably. But if it work anything like CyanogenMod, you'll get nightly update which you can choose to install (bad idea for stability), and once a while there will be a stable release. I haven't use Lineage OS though, I'm sure they're going to improve it over CM, but I don't plan to root or custom Rom from now on. Stock Android or "stockish" and iOS only from now. Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) If you read the Article you would have know that PureNexus is pretty much stock... LineageOS is always a bad idea btw EowynCarter I did read the article, but it don't mention anything about how updates are done. Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) They have a OTA updater app :) hkklife Google must be thrilled. The last Nexus/Pixel device with wireless charging and a man-sized screen is offically EOL. kmand I keep seeing articles about Nexus 6 and Android 8.0. For example http://www.droidreport.com/articles/5965/20170406/google-nexus-6-reportedly-eligible-for-android-8-0-update.htm It seems a little late for April fools. Is this some echoing fake news. abc Shame about Paranoid Android. Loved that ROM back in the days when Google had just ditched updates for the Galaxy Nexus. Browningate Author, did you mean "it" instead of "its" in the paragraph about OmniRom? jibust Did the author even try out the roms before posting?? Omni Rom has too many features?!?!? Come on that is entirely not true, they tend to prioritize stability over features, they like to do things right, so they can take a lot of time to add new features (OMS was just added a few weeks ago). Just feel the author made it look like it's so bleeding edge it's unstable. And it is the complete opposite, usefull and few additions on top of a stable up to date AOSP base.

RSS ALL ARTICLES FEATURES ONLY Search How to Create Custom Voice Commands for Alexa and Google Home With Android and Tasker By Eric Ravenscraft on April 20th, 2017 Tasker is one of the most powerful automation tools on Android. Plugins like AutoVoice let you expand Tasker’s core functionality to do even more cool things…like create custom voice commands for your Amazon Echo or Google Home. Here’s how to make your own voice commands. The built in voice commands in Alexa and Google Home can do some cool things, but Tasker gives you almost complete control over your phone. So, using AutoVoice, you could set your phone to battery saving mode, read your notifications aloud, turn your PS4 on and off, and more. Tasker may not always be the most user-friendly app in the world, but you can build some pretty awesome profiles with it. What You’ll Need RELATED ARTICLE How to Use Tasker to Automate Your Android Phone We’ll assume for the purposes of this article that you’re already familiar with Tasker. If you’re not, check out our guide here to learn the basics. Before you get started, you’ll also need the following: A Google Home or Amazon Echo: Naturally, you’ll need to have one of these voice assistant devices in your living room if you’re going to talk to it. If you haven’t set one up, you can check out our guides to setting up an Amazon Echo or Google Home here. An Android Phone: We’re using an Android app called Tasker for this, so you’ll need an Android phone—there’s no way around this. Thankfully, even older Android phones should work fine. Tasker: This Android automation app lets you create triggers and tasks to manage your phone, or any remote device that you can control through your phone. It costs $2.99 on the Play Store. AutoVoice: For our purposes, this plugin is where the real magic happens. AutoVoice is one of many handy plugins created by developer Joaoapps. AutoVoice comes with a free 7-day trial, but you can buy the AutoVoice Pro Unlock for $2.49. Once you have everything installed, you’ll need to do a bit of setup before you can start creating your own custom voice commands. Link AutoVoice to Your Google Home or Amazon Echo As with anything involving Tasker, setting up AutoVoice will take more than a few steps. First, you’ll need to connect your Google Home or Amazon Echo to your AutoVoice account. If you’re using Google Home, open up the Google Home app and tap the menu icon in the top-left corner. Then, tap “More settings.”   Scroll down and tap Services. In the giant list of services, scroll down until you find AutoVoice. Fortunately, the list is alphabetical, so AutoVoice should be close to the top.   On the AutoVoice service screen, tap the words Link Account in blue. Choose the account you want to link—this should be the same one that you’re using on the phone that’s running Tasker—and give AutoVoice the permissions it needs.   If you’re using an Amazon Echo, you can connect the AutoVoice skill on the web. You can find it on Amazon’s website here. Head to that link, make sure you’re signed in, then click Enable. Just like with Google Home, you’ll need to link your Google account and give it permission. Once you’ve done that, you’re ready to move on to the fun part. Create Your Own Custom AutoVoice Commands Next, we’ll show you how to create your own voice commands. You can use these commands to trigger any task that you can make in Tasker, so use your imagination. For our guide, we’ll trigger a popup to keep things simple. To get started, open the AutoVoice app on your phone and tap AutoVoice Devices. First, AutoVoice will ask for permission to view your contacts to determine which accounts are available on your phone. Tap Allow. Then, choose the same Google account you linked to the AutoVoice service on Google Home or Alexa and tap OK.   Next, open up the Tasker app on your phone. Tap the + symbol at the bottom of the screen to create a new Profile, then tap Event.   In the popup that appears, tap Plugin, then choose AutoVoice.   In the drop down list that appears, scroll to the bottom and choose Recognized. On the next screen, there will be a bar at the top that says Configuration. Tap the pencil icon at the right of this bar. This will take you to the AutoVoice configuration page. First, tap Commands at the top of the screen to enter your custom voice commands. You can add multiple trigger words or phrases separated by a comma if you want Google or Alexa to recognize multiple phrasings for the same command. For example, below we added “hello” and “hi” as commands. If AutoVoice hears either one, it will trigger the same task.   Next, tap Responses. Here, you can set how AutoVoice will respond to you. This gives you a verbal confirmation that AutoVoice received your command, plus it’s a nice way to make your voice assistant a little more conversational. In this case, we told AutoVoice to respond with “hi back at you.” This won’t actually trigger any tasks (we’ll do that part in a second), but it adds some nice flavor to your interaction. Once you’ve added all the commands and responses you want for this task, tap the check box at the top to return to Tasker. Back in Tasker, you’ll see that AutoVoice has filled in the configuration page. You shouldn’t need to change anything here. Just tap the back button at the top (or use your phone’s back button). At this point, you can assign your command to any task you want. If you’ve already made a task in Tasker, you can assign it from your existing library. If you want to create your own, tap the New Task button and give it a name. In our case, we’ll name it Popup, but you should give yours a name based on whatever task you end up creating.   Your process will probably differ from our instructions after this, but we’ll finish our task just to demonstrate. On the task page, tap the + icon at the bottom to add a new action. In the box that pops up, tap Alert, then choose Popup.   Under Text, write a message like “Hi everybody!” When you’re done, tap the back arrow at the top-left corner of the screen, or press your phone’s back button. Now, it’s time to try your command out! Say “[Ok google/Alexa], tell Autovoice hello” and open your phone. You should see a popup that looks like the one below. That should confirm that your AutoVoice command worked. You can replace this sample task with anything you want. Once again, check out our full Tasker guide for how to make more tasks.

However, it sounds as though not all ads will be filtered out, according to the report in the Wall Street Journal. WSJ reports Chrome’s ad blocker will only filter out ads which are considered to provide a poor experience. What’s considered a bad ad type? ”Unacceptable ad types would be those recently defined by the Coalition for Better Ads, an industry group that released a list of ad standards in March. According to those standards, ad formats such as pop-ups, auto-playing video ads with sound and “prestitial” ads with countdown timers are deemed to be “beneath a threshold of consumer acceptability.” Does that mean some ads may make it through Chrome’s ad-blocking filter while others won’t? According to the WSJ, a possible option Google is considering is blocking ads across an entire site if any offending ads are detected anywhere. If this ends up being true, then all ads on a site must adhere to the recently released ad standards or all ads will end up getting blocked. There’s a lot of questions left to be answered, but the WSJ says we could learn more soon with Google being on track to announce the feature “within weeks.” Why Would Google Create an Ad Blocker? No doubt the question on everyone’s minds is why would Google create an ad blocker in the first place. According to WSJ’s report, it has to do with the growth of third-party ad blockers creating a concern within the company. Google would essentially have “more control” over the state of ad blocking. Perhaps there’s a feeling within the company that if bad ads are filtered out, internet users will be more receptive to good ads and less inclined to block them. We’ll have to wait and learn more when the company officially announces the new feature.

The feature can be used on both Apple iOS and Google Android smartphones and tablets, and also lets users monetize the live videos and include in playlists. In addition, users can ask for donations to feature comments from subscribers with the “Super Chat” option. The live streams can be found through YouTube’s existing search function, playlists, or recommendations, and are protected from unauthorized use. Thinking of live-streaming someone else’s content for monetary gain? Think twice.

A Google Doodle was rolled out last Tuesday to celebrate the industrious Ghanaian woman who was instrumental in helping millions of low-income women secure loans and other funding for their businesses. The Google doodle which also celebrated the entrepreneurial and inspirational legacies of “Auntie Ocloo” as she was affectionately called was on display on the homepage of the search engine, to mark what would have been her 98th birthday, last Tuesday, 18th April, 2017. Google said the Doodle depicts what Auntie Ocloo represents; “empowering the women of Ghana with the tools to improve their lives and communities.” According to Google, “Auntie Ocloo” had just six shillings (less than one dollar), when she began making and selling marmalade and orange squash as a young woman in the 1930s. After securing a loan, she further grew her business and eventually founded the Nkulenu Industries, the first food processing business in the then Gold Coast in 1942 after leaving Achimota College. She then traveled to the U.K. to learn more about food processing. On her return, she shared with other Ghanaian women the technical knowledge and skills of how to start and run a business. Due to her success she was invited to the first U.N. World Conference on Women in 1975. Throughout her life, Auntie Ocloo helped improve women’s lives in Ghana and advocated their success in business. She saw the importance of helping women with soft loans to achieve better health and prosperity, but poor black women were often ignored by the banks. So she helped established Women’s World Banking, a global non-profit bank that provided low-income women with micro-loans to help start their own businesses. Mrs. Ocloo who died in 2002, was also the first president of the Federation of Ghana Industries (now, Association of Ghana Industries). The Nkulenu Industries Ltd is still in active business processing Ghanaian food products for export and for domestic consumption.   From Fred Duodu ([email protected] ) TAGS africa daily founder google guide Honors Nkulenu SHARE Facebook Twitter tweet ghanamma RELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHOR Nkonya/Alavanyo: Volta REGSEC beefs up security amidst renewed clash 2 Arrested At Agbogbloshie With Ammunition Gov’t may acquire 100-year disputed land to end Alavanyo, Nkonya conflict Nana Addo Outdoors 750,000 Jobs WASCAL appoints Prof Adegoke as new interim Executive Director Judge Testifies In Robbery Trial LEAVE A REPLY Cancel reply Log in to leave a comment EVEN MORE NEWS Google Honors Nkulenu Founder – Daily Guide Africa April 20, 2017 Bagbin Shocked Over Mahama’s Defeat April 20, 2017 Bisa KDei honoured by Netherlands Embassy April 20, 2017 POPULAR CATEGORY Local News43001 Football26549 Entertainment18746 Politics14446 Nigeria12189 Nollywood11333 Business9609 About Us Advertise Contact Us Disclaimer Privacy Policy © We use cookies to ensure that we give you the best experience on our website.

The company notes that requests are at their highest levels since reports were first published in 2010. Nintendo Switch There were 45,549 requests in the second half of 2016, compared to 44,943 in the previous six month period. Like Google, Microsoft reported a similar uptick in government requests last week. By country, requests from the United States declined from 14,168 in H1 2016 to 13,682 in H2. Requests from Germany and France, which are second and third, respectively, behind the US, rose. However, the times that Google handed over data fell four percentage points after holding steady at 64% for the year prior. The current 60% compliance is at the lowest rate in seven years. In a statement, Google notes the rise of cross-border data requests, with 30,755 requests from countries other than the United States in the first half of 2016 compared to 31,877 in the second half. This scenario is when a crime occurs in one country but data is held by a foreign company. Google is calling for an improved international framework for procuring data as the current governing Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty takes too long. For instance, a request takes 10 months to process in the United States, which the company points out is a “long time for an investigator to wait.” As a result, this increases the possibility of countries passing unilateral legislation to a “fundamentally multilateral problem.” A sustainable framework for handling digital evidence in legitimate cross-border investigations will help avoid a chaotic, conflicting patchwork of data location proposals and ad hoc surveillance measures that may threaten user privacy and generate uncertainty for users and businesses, all without fundamentally advancing legitimate law enforcement and national security interests.

Twitter Facebook 12 tips to curb data usage in Android If your Android device is guzzling data, it can cost you or your employer a bundle. Here are 12 ways to prevent that. JR Raphael (Computerworld (US)) 20 April, 2017 20:00 - - - - print email Comments At a time when a great deal of business is conducted on the go using smartphones, it's become even more important to be conscious of how much data you're using. Whether you're using your own phone or one issued by your company, mobile data is money -- and if you don't optimize your phone to handle it intelligently, you're throwing dollars down the drain. After all, whether you have a plan with a monthly data cap or a setup where you're billed for the data you use, you're essentially paying for all the virtual info you transmit over your carrier's network. In the former case, reducing your data usage could let you move to a cheaper level of service. In the latter, every megabyte you save will directly lower your monthly bill. The good news is that you can cut back on your phone's mobile data usage dramatically -- without much meaningful impact on your day-to-day experience. Here are 12 steps you can follow to track your data and lessen its effect on your -- or your company's -- budget. (Note: Any tips that are specific to a particular version of Android will be noted.) 1. Diagnose your data usage You have to understand a problem before you can fix it -- so start by heading into your system settings and looking for the section labeled "Data usage." Tap that line, then tap "Cellular data usage" on the next screen. JR Raphael / IDG You have to understand a problem before you can fix it. That'll pull up a detailed overview of exactly what apps burned through your mobile data over the most recent 30-day cycle (and if you want even more context, you can look back in previous cycles by tapping the dates at the top of the screen and selecting an earlier range). Many of the top offenders will likely be social media programs, web browsers, and apps that involve streaming audio or video. Make a mental note of any such items; we'll get into the specifics of dealing with them in a moment. If you see anything else that's responsible for more than a few megabytes of mobile data, tap on it to take a closer look. That'll give you a breakdown of how much of the app's data usage was in the foreground -- in other words, the result of something you actively did with your display on -- and how much of it was in the background, or taking place without your active involvement. Keep all of that in mind as we move through the following steps. 2. Battle unnecessary background trickles Now that we know what's eating through your mobile data, it's time to start addressing it. We'll start by seeking out and limiting specific instances of unnecessary background data use. Social and news apps tend to be among the worst at this, as they often check in at regular intervals throughout the day in order to pull in new updates. You can opt to disable that behavior -- and in most cases, you probably won't notice much of a downside from doing so. One by one, open up any social or news apps on your phone and look for data-saving opportunities in their settings. In the Twitter Android app, for instance, you'll find a section called "Data usage." Tap it and then uncheck the box next to "Sync data" to make the app update only when you're actively using it. (That won't affect your ability to get notifications, incidentally; those are controlled separately in the "Notifications" section of the settings.) [ Further reading: 30 tasty tips for Android Nougat ] In a news app like Flipboard, meanwhile, there's an option called "Reduce Data Usage" that's set to "Full use" by default. Change it to either "On demand" or "Don't use mobile data" -- because really, why have the app pull in new stories when you aren't even looking? Finally, if you have an app that showed up as a high consumer of background data in our first step but that doesn't have any obvious way to control its data use within its settings -- like Facebook, for instance, which is a notorious data guzzler but no longer allows you to disable background activity -- take control at the system level: Head into the "Apps" section of your system settings and tap the relevant app's line. Tap "Data usage," then deactivate the toggle next to "Background data." That'll prevent the app from using data in the background unless you're connected to Wi-Fi. (Be sure to use common sense with this. If you disable background data for something like a messaging app, the app isn't going to be able to receive messages in the background when you're out and about during the day. That probably isn't something you want. Even with an app like Facebook, disabling background data means you won't be able to receive new activity notifications unless the app is actively open. Make sure you're OK with any such tradeoffs.) 3. Stop the autoplay insanity Videos are among the most voracious consumers of data -- and lots of apps have the bad habit of playing them when you aren't even paying attention. Social media apps, for example, love to autoplay videos as you scroll through a feed or timeline. But you can change that. JR Raphael / IDG In the Facebook (left) and Twitter (right) Android apps, you'll find options for restricting when media is allowed to autoplay. In the Facebook Android app, if you open the main menu and look all the way down for the line labeled "App Settings," you'll find an option for restricting when media is allowed to autoplay. In Twitter, you'll find a similar option in the "Data Usage" section of the app's settings -- and you'll also find data-saving options for disabling image previews in your timeline and avoiding high-quality video altogether whenever you're on a mobile network. Instagram, Snapchat and other social apps have settings to achieve the same purposes. Seek them all out, and stop letting your data get tossed into the trash. 4. Compress your mobile web experience Next up is an easy fix: Making your browser less of a data hog. Google's Chrome Android browser has an option called Data Saver that routes pages through Google's servers so they're compressed when they reach you. It can save a significant amount of data and actually make your browsing faster, too. JR Raphael / IDG Google's Chrome Android browser has an option called Data Saver that |routes pages through Google's servers so they're compressed when they reach you. To try it out, go into Chrome's settings and look for the line labeled "Data Saver." Tap it, then make sure the toggle there is activated. If you want even more data-saving tools, try Opera or Opera Mini. Both browsers offer their own forms of remote page compression along with options for compressing videos on the web and restricting files to download only when you're connected to Wi-Fi. 5. Optimize your music apps Got Google Play Music? Head into the app's settings and look for the "Quality on mobile network" option. Try setting it to "Low" or "Normal" and then see if the more data-friendly audio quality is good enough for your ears. While you're in the settings, take a moment to confirm that the option for "Download only on Wi-Fi" is activated -- and think carefully about the option to "Cache music while streaming." That'll cause the app to download every song while you stream it, which means the song will then be locally stored and won't require any additional data if you listen to it again in the future. If you tend to listen to the same songs over and over, activating that option is advisable. If you don't repeat-listen too often, you'd probably be better off leaving it deactivated so you don't needlessly use the data required for downloading (especially if you're using one of the lower-quality mobile streaming settings). Play Music isn't the only audio app with these sorts of options, of course. Spotify, Pandora and most other music and podcast services have similar controls. Be sure to look through the settings of any such apps on your phone to make sure they're configured in the most data-efficient manner possible. 6. Put YouTube on a mobile data diet While we're on the subject of streaming, open up the YouTube app and look in the "General" section of its settings. There, you'll find an option to "Limit mobile data usage." Activate it, and the app will use a lower-quality and thus less data-intensive stream whenever you're on a mobile network. On the same screen, find the option labeled "Autoplay" and make sure it's disabled. 7. Download media in advance The best way to cut back on mobile data streaming is to avoid it -- and many multimedia apps make that easy to do. The trick is simply to download the content you want in advance, while you're connected to Wi-Fi, so it'll be locally stored and available whenever you're relying on mobile data. And don't forget that if you subscribe to Google Play Music, you also have the ability to download videos from YouTube for on-the-go viewing. Look in the "Background & offline" section of the YouTube app's settings to get started. (Assuming you have an active Play Music subscription, that is -- if you don't, the section won't show up for you.) 8. Take your navigation offline You know what else can download data in advance and help you avoid expensive streaming? Google Maps. The next time you know you're going to need navigation, open the Maps app in advance while you're still somewhere with Wi-Fi. Punch in the route you'll need, then look for the box with the option to download offline directions. JR Raphael / IDG The next time you know you're going to need navigation, open the Maps app in advance while you're still somewhere with Wi-Fi, punch in the route you'll need, then look for the gray box with the option to download offline directions. You can see and manage your downloaded maps in the "Offline areas" section of Maps' settings. 9. Put the Play Store on notice App updates are great! They're also, however, often large -- and if you aren't careful, they can use an awful lot of your mobile data allotment. Make sure that isn't happening by opening up the Play Store on your phone, finding its settings and ensuring the "Auto-update apps" option is set to "Wi-Fi only." 10. Plug up senseless leaks Now's a good time to think about any apps on your phone that you no longer use and to uninstall them (or disable them, if they came preinstalled and can't be removed) -- especially if they showed up in your list of top mobile data drainers. Keeping any such items on your phone is like keeping an out-of-use cable box plugged into an electrical outlet. Every little bit adds up -- so why allow a leak on your resources for no real reason? 11. Perform an account syncing audit While you've got your plumber pants on, head into the "Accounts" section of your system settings. Tap "Google," then tap the line for your main Google account. See all that stuff your phone is syncing? Odds are, at least some of it is related to services you never use. If, say, you never use Google Drive or Google Play Movies or Google+, deactivate the toggle next to the corresponding line. That's one less thing your phone will check in on throughout the day. Got multiple Google accounts connected to your phone? Repeat this step for each of 'em. 12. Go nuclear on unnecessary data use If you've tried all the above options and still feel like you could stand to use less data, there's one more step to try -- and it's a drastic one. Android (version 7.0 and up) has a system-level tool called Data Saver that prevents most apps from using mobile data unless they're open on your screen and actively being used. That means apps won't be able to do anything in the background, including fetching and notifying you about new messages, unless you're on Wi-Fi (or unless you manually whitelist them as an exception). It's an extreme measure, to be sure -- but if you're desperate to curb your mobile data use, even temporarily, it's one final step worth considering. You can find the option within the "Data usage" section of your system settings. 7 Habits of the Effective Network Manager More from NetScout Join the Computerworld newsletter!

Baig, USA TODAY 4:11 p.m. ET April 20, 2017 Google Home (Photo: Google) 1 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE Among the first things you might ask the cloud-based voice activated Google Assistant inside Google Home is to “tell me about my day.” Google Assistant will then rattle off the local weather, upcoming appointments and connect you to preferred news sources. Until now, though, the standalone artificial intelligence-infused $129 speaker — Google’s rival to Amazon’s popular Alexa voice-based Echo speaker — couldn’t distinguish your voice from that of a spouse, partner or roommate. Heck, they want to hear about their day too. Google began rolling out a feature this week to remedy the situation in households with a shared Google Home unit: the ability for up to six people to connect their account to that unit and, following a brief training period, have the speaker recognize each person’s voice independently. Google Home can then deliver their commute times, calendars, playlists and so on — not yours. Related: MSU's $62M business school expansion aims for Google vibe It’s a welcome feature that addresses a potential nuisance — and is a stunt Alexa can’t yet pull off on Echo devices, though  Amazon no doubt is at work trying. Amazon Echo  (Photo: Amazon) You’ll need the latest Google Home app to get started. Then, look for a card that says “multi-user is available” and if you can’t find it, click the icon in the upper right to locate your connected devices, and make sure to link your account. Google asks you to train your voice by saying the phrases, “OK Google” and “Hey Google” twice each.  The way Google explains it, the phrases are analyzed by a neural network that can detect certain characteristics of each voice. From then on, any time you say "OK Google" or "Hey Google" to your Google Home, the neural network will compare the sound of your voice to its previous analysis to determine whether it is you speaking or not, a comparison Google claims takes place in a matter of milliseconds. A few things to keep in mind: If you have more than one Google Home in your house, you’ll have to set up each one independently even if you share the same network; voice training is local to the device.  The feature doesn’t work on smartphones that incorporate the Google Assistant either, though phones of course are more personal anyway. Google Home in the kitchen  (Photo: Google) Google also adds that the feature is not available for kids under 13. The feature rollout comes to the U.S. first and will expand to the U.K. in coming months, Google says.

After Google delaying the update at the eleventh hour, Google has provided a new timeline for when owners of those devices can expect to see Wear 2.0 arrive. In a recently published Android Wear 2.0 FAQ, Android Wear support forums community manager Ernest says Wear smartwatch users can expect Android Wear to come to those smartwatches sometime either at the end of this month or towards late May. Many of the devices included in the list are some of the most popular Android Wear smartwatches, including the Moto 360, Huawei Watch and Asus ZenWatch 3. Unfortunately, Google did not provide a more specific start time for the rollout. The full list can be shown below: Moto 360 Gen 2 Moto 360 Sport LG Watch Urbane 2nd Edition LTE Huawei Watch Huawei Watch Ladies Asus ZenWatch 2 Asus ZenWatch 3 In an interview with Engadget, a spokesperson for the company said the delay was due to an unspecified bug found in final testing.

Through a series of peculiar job listings and key hires, it became clear Facebook was up to something unlike anything it had ever pursued. Building 8, as the company would name it, was to be a new division under famed technologist Regina Dugan, former director of the government's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). Dugan had transitioned to the tech industry in 2012, serving as the head of Google’s experimental ATAP group. Among other things, it was responsible for the promising but now defunct Ara modular smartphone project. On Wednesday, Facebook took the wraps off Building 8 and had Dugan tell the world know what exactly her fast-growing team has been working on. At the day-2 keynote at the company’s F8 developer conference in San Jose, Dugan announced Facebook’s plans for two ambitious projects: one to develop a system for letting you type with just your thoughts, and another to let you “hear” using vibrations on your skin. This would be done through brain-computer interfaces — devices that can read neural activity and translate it into digital signals, and vice versa. Facebook wants to help you type with your thoughts The objective: to help Facebook take the lead in the burgeoning field of augmented reality, which integrates our online and offline lives using a variety of still yet-to-be-built devices. “The goal of an [augmented reality] system is to have a much more blended physical and digital world,” Dugan told The Verge in an interview. “I break that if I have an input mechanism that is not also blended between my physical and digital world.” In Facebook’s view, the road to AR will be paved with the smartphone camera. But eventually, it leads to the brain — which is where Dugan and her team come in. Dugan says Facebook’s goal is to develop something it calls a “brain click — a way to complete tasks in augmented reality using your mind. You could brain click to dismiss a notification that popped up on your AR glasses, for example. Researchers at Building 8, who have teamed up with medical institutions around the country, want to turn the brain into an input device, starting with letting people type with their thoughts. Even “something as simple as yes/no, on/off” would be the “equivalent of having the actual mouse in the advent of the graphical user interface,” Dugan says. AR glasses that receive inputs directly from your brain would be ideal, Dugan says, because that would further reduce the disconnect that technology creates between people and their surroundings. She feels similarly about Building 8’s second announced project, an effort to broadcast messages to your skin. “It’s the whisper being delivered,” Dugan says. “It wouldn’t break the social contract. If I pick up my phone while we’re talking, I have broken the connection I feel to the people here in this room.” And so Building 8 is pursuing a way to “hear” with your skin, using what amount to a series of vibrations on one’s arm that correspond to words and phrases. Eventually, you may be able to send discrete messages delivered through touch. You may be able to send messages delivered to the skin The work builds on the advent of Braille and a technique known as the Tadoma method, a communication format developed for deaf and blind individuals that relies on the impaired person feeling the movement of the lips and the vibrations of a speaker’s throat with their hands to make out the spoken words. Facebook wants to build on those techniques, which extract semantic meaning from touch, to create what just might amount to a new form of language. “I think the thing that is so interesting to me is how inherently wired we are to language and communication,” Dugan says. “Our cochlea works in one way. But we can interpret language through Braille, the Tadoma method… we’re just wired for it.” The company has rigged up a working device that has allowed a Facebook employee to differentiate between three shapes, colors, and actions through just vibrations on her skin. “She learns how the word black feels and how the word blue feels different,” Dugan says. “You could imagine over time you could begin to understand how the components of the words feel.” Facebook imagines this as both a method of discreet communication for healthy consumers and a way to restore communication to people with disabilities. Photo: Facebook They are bold goals, but Building 8 has set a concrete path for achieving them. Dugan became famous at Google’s ATAP unit by implementing an aggressive two-year deadline for each project it pursued. Dugan adapted this method from DARPA, where it was used to great effect. It was DARPA that laid the foundation for the early internet, in the late 1960s, and has been responsible for early versions of everything from GPS to Google Street View to Wikipedia. At Google, the strategy bore less fruit. The Ara project ran into repeated roadblocks and was eventually shuttered, but Dugan has reportedly altered her approach at Building 8. According to The Information, Dugan is working more closely with product specialists at Facebook to ensure projects can exit the prototype phase and make it to market. Dugan’s work at Google hit roadblocks Google ATAP’s Project Ara was a modular smartphone concept that never manifested as a consumer product. Building 8’s first two-year goal is to improve the rate at which people can type with their thoughts to 100 words per minute using implanted electrodes. At Stanford University, implanted electrode arrays inside paralyzed patients allow them to type with their thoughts at up to eight words per minute. To increase typing speeds, Dugan and her team are monitoring medical trials and working with partner institutions including UC San Francisco, UC Berkeley, and Johns Hopkins Medicine. The second goal of Building 8 over the next two years is to determine whether typed thoughts can be read non-invasively — which is to say, without having to implant a device in the brain. That would lower the cost of the device dramatically, and make it available (and desirable) to a much wider group of people. “Implanted electrodes simply won’t scale,” Dugan said on stage Wednesday. Instead, the company is exploring how optical imaging could get real-time data from the brain and translate it into words. The resulting device could be something like a neural cap worn on the head, or some type of band that stretches around the back of the skull. “Implanted electrodes simply won’t scale.” Of course, it’s possible to hear about Facebook’s plans and worry the company is planning to invade your privacy in new, more dystopian ways — literally getting inside your head and under your skin. But Mark Chevillet, Facebook’s technical lead on the thought typing project, says the technology should be designed to operate only during the final part of the speech process, right before your brain tells your mouth to start moving. The thought is already formed, and you have made an explicit choice to share it. “If you’ve dictated to Siri, imagine the same thing but without you speaking outside,” he says. “You would be speaking internally — you’re just not actually making the sounds.” Dugan was quick to point out onstage at F8 that the company is not interested in reading your thoughts. “That might be more than any of us care to know,” Dugan said. “And it’s not something any of us should have a right to know.” Dugan became well known in the industry for her high-energy presentations of concept projects at Google’s ATAP unit. Whatever their plans, Dugan and Building 8 have a significant amount of scientific challenges to overcome. Other companies, like Elon Musk’s Neuralink and Bryan Johnson’s Kernel, are also pursuing brain-computer interfaces, though with more grandiose visions of turning us into smarter, faster cyborgs. Though we know little about Musk’s efforts, Kernel has more than $100 million from Johnson, a PayPal co-founder, to advance neuroscience research. Dugan is unfazed by competing efforts. “You can talk about it in general terms, or you can get down to business,” she says. “This isn’t cocktail party talk. This is serious.” It’s one thing to lay out a grand vision, she says, and another to build a process capable of achieving it. Building 8 has a concrete plan, Dugan says, and it is already attracting some of the best minds in the industry. “This is a style of work I know,” she says. “If you want to look at 60 years of history and success, that’s the model you use. That’s what we do.” In this Storystream Facebook F8 conference 2017: the latest news and biggest changes coming to the platform Facebook’s plans to augment reality are as dystopian as they are smart How Facebook is taking mind reading from sci-fi to reality Facebook’s AI-powered camera can blur photo backgrounds in real time View all 16 stories Next Up In Science The bizarre biology of the naked mole rat means oxygen is a bonus Tesla app update lets Powerwall owners keep an eye on their electricity The light of this distant supernova was warped and split in four ways by a passing galaxy Stress yourself out with this coloring book about climate change Can hemp extract provide health benefits without getting you high?

ITSHOW 2017 Search for: Home > Google > Google Earth Receives Dramatic New Update GoogleNews Google Earth Receives Dramatic New Update David F. April 19, 20170240 In its biggest update yet, Google Earth adds new features and overhauls its interface. A big update dropped for Google Earth yesterday which overhauls the interface and adds several new features. The coolest feature is undoubtedly Voyager, which offers several guided tours of the planet. You can select from various topics, such as tours of national parks, famous buildings, or UNESCO World Heritage sites, and Earth will take you from spot to spot and showcase a handful of locations. On one side of the screen, you’ll have a bird’s eye view of the area, while the right side of the screen will have a short description, and some kind of media. At its simplest, the media may be images of the location, but there’s also video clips, and sometimes 360-degree video tours. One of the national parks tours for example, begins by showing you a 360-degree guided tour of a glacial crevasse! Another new feature is an “I’m feeling lucky” button, which throws you to a random location on the planet. When using this feature (or the search function), you’ll notice another cool feature which enhances your exploration. Google have integrated their search engine technology into Earth to provide “knowledge cards” containing a blurb about any location you happen to end up at. The interface has been overhauled as well, and while it does look more modern, it is somewhat clunky to use. A slim panel of buttons on the left and navigational controls in the lower right corner are all you have to obstruct the view of the planet, but it seems as if the focus on slim design means some control has been sacrificed. For one, there’s no longer a zoom slider (just zoom buttons), and no rotate view buttons. Since these controls are largely accessible from your mouse, it isn’t a major problem, but the mini-map poses some serious drawbacks. In previous versions of Earth, a panning button allowed for an alternative to moving the map around, but that has been removed and replaced by a miniature globe. The globe highlights your location with a red X (or, when zoomed out, a red shape showing your field of view). You can use the mouse to navigate this globe, but it’s made difficult since you can only see one half of the planet at a time. Navigating involves click dragging to form an arrow and then releasing the mouse button and getting a short fly-to animation. It’s pretty, but not very functional. One noteworthy change is that Earth is no longer the ‘download alternative’ to Google Maps. If you’re using Chrome, you can access Earth from your browser. It’s still available as a downloadable version of course, and there’s an Android app, both of which look as pretty as the online version. The overhaul is apparently the result of two years of work by Google. source: Business Insider ChromeGooglegoogle earth David F.

While this original document is only available to Google employees, Wells adapted it and posted it to a public community that caters to Chromium developers. “After several recent efforts to remove gender-specific code from Chromium, we’d like to keep our code base gender-neutral,” Wells announced on the discussion thread. “Help keep our code base gender free :)” The gender-neutral guidelines contain sections on the significance of gender-neutral terms, specific suggestions, and tools to help developers find and remove gendered terms. “Some points in our code, documentation and comments contain needless assumptions about the gender of a future reader, user, etc,” say the guidelines. “Example: “When the user logs into his profile.” (emphasis in original) The guidelines cite the “Be respectful and constructive” section of Chromium’s Code of Conduct and adds emphasis to the phrases “enjoy our experience,” “discrimination,” and “condescension.” “Unnecessarily gendered code is discriminatory and condescending,” notes Google. “And reading biased code isn’t enjoyable.” The guidelines say to avoid gendered pronouns and words like “brother,” “mother,” and “man.” “[‘He or she,’ ‘his/hers,’ and ‘(s)he’] exclude those who don’t identify with either gender, and implicitly (slightly) favor one gender via listing it first,” explain the guidelines, before suggesting users “[avoid] ‘guys’ as a gender-neutral term, which has male associations.” “Usually in comments it implies anthropomorphism of inanimate objects and should be replaced with a more precise technical term. If it does refer to people, consider using ‘everyone,’ ‘folks,’ ‘people,’ ‘peeps,’ ‘y’all,’ etc.” “These are only suggestions,” the guidelines say at one point. “You make the call.” The Chromium guidelines assert it’s alright to use gendered language when referring to a specific person, using names like “He” and “Guy” that resemble gendered words, and using “He” as an abbreviation for “helium.” The guidelines also suggest using the singular pronoun “they,” or changing the hypothetical person to plural people in order to avoid singular gendered pronouns. Users can also reword sentences to exclude pronouns entirely. “The guidelines are pretty new,” Google spokeswoman Maggie Shiels told The Daily Caller News Foundation. “3 weeks old and generally speaking well received.” Follow Rob Shimshock on Twitter Connect with Rob Shimshock on Facebook Send tips to [email protected] .

Hey, there. It looks like you're using an ad blocker. The news and features are funded in part by our advertisers. To support Ad Age and the industry we cover please either: SUBSCRIBE or WHITELIST US Ad Industry Powers Consider Adopting Ad Blocking on a Wide Scale By George Slefo. Published on April 20, 2017. Most Popular The biggest players in advertising and tech are mapping out a strategy to kill off the digital ads that have been deemed as the absolute worst by consumers. The most likely approach is the adoption of a "technology" -- the term "ad blocker" has baggage among many of the participants in talks on the subject -- that would prevent browsers such as Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge from displaying autoplaying video ads with sound, pop-up ads and ads that quickly flash or change colors. The discussions are taking place among members of the industry's Coalition for Better Ads, including Google, Microsoft, Procter & Gamble, Unilever, WPP's ad-buying giant GroupM, Facebook, Thomson Reuters, The Washington Post, the Interactive Advertising Bureau and the Association of National Advertisers, according to Stu Ingis, counsel to the coalition and attorney at Venable LLP. "The end game here is to remove these types of ads which are undercutting the consumer internet experience," Ingis said. "Truthfully, those ads can potentially and seriously undercut the broader internet ecosystem." A "blocking mechanism" or "technology" to prevent such ads from appearing will be put into place before the end of this year, Ingis predicted. Google said it does not comment on speculation, but said it's been working closely with the coalition for Better Ads and its members. The IAB declined to comment. GroupM, Facebook, Unilever and P&G could not immediately be reached for comment. Earlier this year, the Coalition for Better Ads paid some 25,000 participants in the U.S. and Europe to rate 104 different ad experiences on desktop and mobile. Their findings, released in March, revealed what many already know: Consumers don't like autoplay video ads with sound, pop-up ads and ads that quickly flash or change colors. Though the findings seemed obvious, the coalition was partly trying to create a ranking of sorts to inform its effort to stop the worst ads. An independent monitoring group would be required should the coalition decide on adopting ad blocking technology, Ingis said. "I don't see a scenario where there is a technology solution, but there isn't oversight," he said. "Oversight is needed to make sure the tech is doing what it is supposed to. Oversight is needed so no one company is by themselves in setting or making determinations." Ad blocking tech would elevate premium publishers that don't sell annoying ad formats and protect them from actors that will sell anything possible, Ingis said. Hamish Nicklin, chief revenue officer at the Guardian, said the idea was promising. "We welcome any initiative that helps to create an open web where the experience of readers is put first, and in which publishers like the Guardian -- which has long believed in a fewer, better approach to the ads we place across our products -- can prosper," Nicklin said. Questions about implementation remain though, he added. "While these developments will help to promote good formats, it's unclear how they will deal with the gaming of good formats, with bad dynamic creatives, which we have seen being served through mainstream programmatic exchanges," Nicklin said. As it stands right now, no solution has been adopted. In fact, the Coalition for Better Ads is still in the process of drawing up its roadmap, something it says will be complete within the coming weeks. From there, coalition board members will decide on what solution they will use to stop annoying ads from surfacing. That decision will likely come in September or by the end of this year, Ingis said. "What I would say is stay tuned, because I think as we really develop this, the consumer is going to see a rapidly improved ad experience," he said. "If the question is, 'Isn't this motivated by self-interest,' the answer is absolutely it is driven by self-interest." "The ad industry has a self-interest to make sure the ad supported internet that consumers love continues," he added. "The incentives of the ad industry, from my view, are exactly right. And they are perfectly aligned with what consumer interest would want." ~ ~ ~ CORRECTION: An earlier version of this article erroneously attributed information about the talks at the Coalition for Better ads to Chuck Curran, counsel to the coalition and attorney at Venable LLP.

In creating the site back in 2011, hiking enthusiast Mike Todd says he meant it to be useful for hikers of all experience levels, from people who’ve done a lot of hiking before and can name their favorite best tactical backpack brand off the top of their head, to those who might be just getting into it. “I found that a lot of the hiking resources online were for 10- to 15-mile hikes, and that’s great for some people, but that’s not what a casual day-hiker is generally looking to do. This is really designed so that a complete beginner — if you didn’t know anything about the area or about the hike or location — will have everything they need to know to successfully navigate the hike and hopefully have a great day out there.” A custom Google map with color-coded pins dropped on all the trailheads — red for the toughest hikes, yellow for intermediate and green for the easiest — is a quick way to get a thumbnail view of a particular hike and situate it within the larger landscape. But the best way to start is to go straight to “The Hikes” and choose which side of the Hudson you’re on. An alphabetical listing of each hike is charted along with its scenery rating (on a scale from “one to five cameras”), a difficulty rating from one to ten, the distance the hike covers and a brief description of what’s encountered on the hike. One can figure out quickly here that while Millbrook Mountain offers five-camera scenery and Kaaterskill Falls is listed as a four-camera destination, the former’s difficulty rating of “9” versus the latter’s “5” may determine the choice of which to hike if looking for great views but a less strenuous experience. Todd says his five-camera scenery rating system is admittedly “highly subjective;” just his opinion on which hikes have the best views, or if there’s a waterfall, which is the most beautiful. “Any of the hikes that have five cameras are like the quintessential Hudson Valley hike,” he adds. “They’re the ones that people might want to start checking off their list first.” Advertisement Once a hike is selected from the chart, the play-by-play begins with a weekly weather forecast for that area and other extras like a link to a Google Terrain map and a Google Earth flyover of the hiking route. A personal review from Todd compares the hike to ones with similar attributes or provides information that might be helpful from the start, like whether it’s too steep for your dog or whether little kids will be able to stay the course. The actual trail guide follows all of that, including lots of photos and sometimes videos, and then the opportunity for hikers to weigh in with their comments after taking the hike. Todd often updates the guides as people write in, especially if the signage or trail conditions have changed since he was there. His most popular trail guides, he says, are the ones for Breakneck Ridge (five cameras, a “10” difficulty rating, 3.7 mile loop with “insane views”) on the east side of the river and Mohonk Mountain House: Labyrinth & Lemon Squeeze on the west (five cameras, a “9” difficulty rating, 5.5 mile loop with “great views, crazy rock labyrinth and Skytop Tower”). Trending Saugerties approves 53-unit village apartment complex Medical marijuana slow to take off, with legal recreational use not happening any time soon Some weedy recipes to bring your edibles game to a higher level For something less traveled, Todd says the Taconic Mountains in the northeast corner of Dutchess County offer truly gorgeous views, with Brace Mountain (click on “Brace Mountain II”) at the highest point offering a five-camera, “9” level difficulty, 3.8 mile hike with “amazing views, an open field at the summit and a waterfall”). The easiest hike is the Walkway Over the Hudson, which has a wheelchair-accessible elevator to get visitors up to and down from the deck. There are also several hikes rated a 2 or 3 that are not as arduous as the rest. (In Todd’s explanation of how he came up with the difficulty ratings, a “4” is listed as “the last safe number on which to bring friends who don’t like hiking.”) The website is written in a very approachable manner, friendly and jargon-free. Mike Todd also writes a weekly humor column — “It’s a slice of life kind of thing, sort of a poor man’s Dave Barry,” he says — published in the Roxborough Review and several other newspapers outside Philadelphia, where he grew up. The column is called “Just Humor Me” in most of the papers (one calls it “Over the Top”), and Todd maintains a blog at www.justhumormeweekly.wordpress.com that serves as a repository for those columns after publication. Todd started hiking after moving to Poughkeepsie in 2000. Not knowing anybody in the area and looking for something to do after work “that didn’t involve a PlayStation2,” he bought some trail guides at the local bookstore and started exploring the region. When his employer, IBM, was looking for someone to coordinate outdoor activities for new hires, he volunteered to lead a weekly hike after work every Thursday. In the Hudson Valley, says Todd, “You can start your hiking day at 5 p.m. in the summertime and have so many great choices of places to hit and still get back to your car by sunset.” But after five years of leading the hiking group, he was no longer a new hire and his family began to grow. Hiking went on the back burner until his oldest son, Evan, who is now five, was around a year old. “If he was having a fussy day in the house, teething, whatever, I had this hiking backpack and I would put him in it. He could sit in that thing all day long and be perfectly happy, so we’d give my wife what we called her ‘moment of Zen,’ and I would take Evan and the dog and we’d clear out of the house.” And that’s when Todd had the idea for HiketheHudsonValley.com. “I just started taking my son on all these different hikes around here and exploring new places that I’d never been. And there are a lot of great web resources out there for hiking in the Hudson Valley, but I couldn’t find one that had all my favorite spots on it, that would tell somebody who didn’t know anything about these places how to get there, where to park, what trails to take, what can you expect to find, the viewpoint… so I thought doing this website would be a fun project.” Todd and his wife, Kara — also employed as a manager at IBM — met at Penn State, where they both went to college. (In a classic “meet cute” scenario, they both happened to be sick on the same day and skipped the same class to go to the health services building, where he struck up a conversation with her.) The couple has a second son now, Zack, who just turned three. “So at the moment, I can pretty much do any hike that a three-year-old can do,” says Todd. “When I’m walking and his older brother is walking, he doesn’t want to be in the backpack; he wants to get down and walk with us. So I haven’t been getting out quite as much this year, but as the kids grow, we’ll get there soon with all of us getting out there. Evan did Storm King Mountain when he wasn’t even four years old, and that’s a pretty decent hike.” Todd plans to keep adding to the website. “It took a lot of work to set it up, and at first I wondered if anybody was even going to use it and were the guides going to be useful. But it’s gotten really good, positive comments and a ton of traffic and feedback. People seem to like having a lot of detail and pictures. It takes me a long time to put a new guide on there, but I just try to spend a few minutes a day on it, after work.” Todd’s latest trail guides are for Red Wing Recreation Area in Billings (near Lagrangeville), a relatively easy “4” difficulty, three-camera trail loop of two miles, and the more challenging five-hour, 7.5 mile loop of “Gertrude’s Nose” at Minnewaska in Gardiner. “That’s a five-camera hike,” he says. “I took a friend visiting from Philadelphia there and spent the whole time saying, ‘This might be the nicest hike in the Hudson Valley.’ It’s at least toward the top of the list.”   For more information, visit www.Hike the Hudson Valley.com or email Mike Todd at mikectodd@gmail.com.  Read more stories from Almanac Weekly Related Tagged: almanac weekly nature nature Sign up for the Almanac Weekend newsletter Almanac Weekend You might like these By Jove: It’s a great week to look up into the night sky Interfaith Earth Day — At the intersection of theology and ecology Jane Colden, America’s first female botanist, classified plants locally Check it out Harvey G.

WSJ: Google planning to block bad ads in Chrome on desktop and mobile Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/04/19 6:31pm PDTApr 19, 2017 67 Plus 1 on G+ 132 Share on Facebook 74 Share on Twitter Total Shares273 Google News Rumors Advertising is very much a balancing act for websites these days. You want to make enough money from an ad-supported site to cover costs, but you don't want to annoy users to the point they block all your ads. Some websites don't seem to care how much they annoy you, though. Google is reportedly getting ready to take a stand against the worst ads on the web with a built in ad-blocker for Chrome. According to the Wall Street Journal, Google's ad-blocking feature could be turned on by default in the desktop and mobile versions of Chrome. It would filter out only the ads Google deems unacceptable. That would cover things like pop-ups, auto-playing video ads, and “prestitial” ads with countdown timers. Google may even build the feature such that it blocks all the ads on a site that serves one of these unacceptable ads. That would nudge website operators to get all their ads in order—after all, Chrome is a huge chunk of usage. Google has not commented on the Wall Street Journal's story, probably because it's still trying to figure out how to pitch the ad blocker (if it's real). This could be seen as an attempt to coerce website operators to only run Google's AdSense ads, which are guaranteed not to run afoul of Google's blocking policies. It's a risky direction for an advertising powerhouse like Google to go, but it might not see a better way to deal with the prevalence of ad-blocking.

AbbyZFresh What did WSJ do to you? Nathan J What did they do for you? The Wall Street Journal is owned by Rupert Murdoch's News Corp, which runs the propaganda arm of the Republican party in the US, better known as Fox News. Murdoch's interference in politics and opposition to freedom isn't limited to the US. I don't recall the details, but the EU or UK was about to kick him out for starting trouble over there a year or two ago. I'm not real big on politics, but I think a certain distrust of News Corp, to a point, is healthy and should not really be questioned. Cakefish You might be referring to News of The World - a British tabloid newspaper run by Rupert Murdoch that was closed down a few years ago because it was found to have spied on people's phones. This included hacking the phone of a murdered teenager and soldiers who had died in combat. It caused a massive uproar. ZettabyteGamer Spread a lot of false information about YouTubers, and YouTube as a platform. They focus on clicks, and getting subscribers instead of accurate information reporting. givitumibeybi WSJ is a wannabe BuzzFeed newspaper. Trooper311 Awesome. Josh Crumley Good. Those ones where you load a page and start reading then suddenly disappears and a fullscreen ad with a 5 "second" timer starts going that takes about 5 seconds *per* second...ugh (looking at you gawker media). I just hope they don't automatically assume all google ad placements are ok just because they're google ads. DozensOfUs If you read gawker sites, it means you're a liberal weenie and deserve to be annoyed. Josh Crumley It was a kotaku article about zelda breath of the wild... 😆😄 https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/d88dd0554cbbcfbefae945805e94ca40e0596a9a2abfb8beb5f9b9b849ce1225.gif Martin The one that are making Sound and are pretty much impossible to close need to be first!!! (You won an iPhone - beeeeeeeeeeeeeep beeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeep beeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeep)... :) DragoCubed The vibrations! MJ Cool I guess but I recommend everyone just get a real ad blocker like uBlock Origin and be done with it. RyRyTheFunBun I begrudgingly use Dolphin on all my Android devices for the ad blocker. Their are better, but dolphin renders almost all sites correctly and is fast. freshprince_87 Chrome is better D.Smithee Are you kidding me? You're using that shitty adblocker add-on for Dolphin? That extension hasn't been updated in years. Just use Brave Browser for Android--it's essentially Chrome with adblocking, tracker blocking, HTTPS and fingerprinting protection with a few added necessities. Nathan J On mobile, just run a system-wide ad blocker. AdGuard on Android and AdBlock on iOS. Chrome works just fine with no ads seen anywhere. MJ Nothing wrong with Adguard but installing a whole app seems overkill when an browser add-on will do. I really have no interest in using Chrome on mobile. ZettabyteGamer What mobile browser do you use, our of curiosity? My1 well because if you do things like adaway and whatnot all the apps' ads will be kicked right into oblivion and not just the browser's ones. also when you have root, you can let the adblocker just play with the hosts file and let the networking layer do its thing. MJ I just need an ad blocker for the browser. I normally don't install programs that don't let you pay to remove ads. Root is a go since I use Android Pay. Finding it weird I have now had a half dozen replies giving me suggestions and "solutions" yet I didn't express having any problem... My1 well I dunno how secure android pay is but unless there is a chip similar to a smartcard or apple's secure enclave in the phone which stores all the needed data, it can be copied, effectively killing everything. I like my banking card with chip which is pretty much exactly a smart card meaning you cant read out any data without essentially destroying the card itself, and if made properly, the data will destroy itself when tampering happens. MJ I don't know where you live but in the US the smart chip on cards as been a disaster. This is the procedure to do a transaction... 1. Look at machine and wonder if the smart card reader is active? Is there a sign? Will the clerk tell me? No? Ask or guess... 2. The smartcard reader is active so now have to choose 1-3 options with buttons than wait 5-10 seconds for the transaction to be done. 3. Be startled by the annoying sound many terminals make like there was a error but it just means remove your card. Security? The magnetic stripe is still there! The procedure for a wireless transaction... 1. Look for the wireless/Android Pay symbol. Hold phone up to terminal and a second later transaction is done. Security? I know it uses end-to-end encryption for transactions. What will copy what and how? Carsten AdGuard is not for your browser, but for your whole system. So, "Free with ads" becomes basically free, for example ;) Nathan J Or "free with a white space taken out from where the ad was." Some ad blockers on the computer (or most now, maybe) can also remove the space, but we're not there yet on phones. Of course, you shouldn't use an ad blocker to rip off app developers. Buy the ad-free version. The only one I'm not doing that for is the weather apps. Most of them won't let you just buy an ad free version. They'll let you take the ads off for a year, but then they come back and/or they charge you again. Pretty greedy! Of course, there are pay-once weather apps, but the popular ones (Weather Channel, Weather Underground) only have the subscription. (I really need to just suck it up and get Dark Sky...) Carsten Well, we are - in most apps I don't get empty spaces. In Chrome definitely not, AdGuard uses some stuff (I don't know how) to remove the spaces entirely. Also: you can get lifetime licenses ;) For details, see this. They have written about such things just a few days ago: https://blog.adguard.com/en/adguard-vs-adaway-dns66/ Cakefish BBC Weather app. Free with no ads. Nathan J Android only? UK only perhaps? BBC is great but often they limit things to people who pay their fees — which is completely understandable. But when the Boston Marathon bombing happened, I went straight to the Beeb for coverage, online, in the US, and it was pretty great. Live video coverage, live tweets from their people (I guess), and a summary of what went down. They're the best. Cakefish Android and iOS. I checked on the website and apparently it's only available to download in the UK. That's a shame as it's a great app but understandable. Nathan J That's a pretty arbitrary limitation, and why I got a 128GB phone. Probably more than I need, but I've used more than a 64GB phone will hold. I don't know about Adguard on Android, but AdBlock on iPhone uses 16.9MB of space. That's with its filters. The app and its data and cache. And apps are usually bigger on iOS because, unlike Android, they can't share libraries, they're totally sandboxed. My biggest space hog is Spotify at 35.4GB. But again, why I got a 128GB phone. Second biggest is a game taking up about a tenth of that. Followed by VLC, which contains all videos stored on this phone (I don't use iTunes). Get a bigger phone, man. You'll thank yourself for it many times. Or go on arbitrarily limiting yourself. But don't think it's anything but that. MJ What? I don't need a bigger phone? I mentioned nothing about storage? Limiting myself? What are talking about? LOL How about you stop trolling? Nathan J This word, trolling. It doesn't mean what you think it means. If anything, you were trolling and I tried to respond rationally. Grow up. MJ You wrote a 100 some word essay about how I needed a "bigger" phone that was not relevant to anything. BLOCKED Nathan J Run on home to your safe space, bully. Ladies and gentlemen, this is why you stand up to bullies. They usually fold. Occasionally, in epic fashion. Especially online when they find out they don't have quite the presence they do on the playground. Jorge I guess no ad blocker will work on Android if you still use Chrome. Chrome serves the content right to you instead of your phone fetching the content from the source website. You need to use a different browser to block ads. Nathan J You guess incorrectly. What you're experiencing is Google proxying around your ad blocker. You have Chrome's data saver turned on. Bypassing your ad blocker is an unintended side effect. Turn off the data saver feature and the ad blocker will in fact block ads in Chrome. Chrome is not magically evading your ad blocker. You're just using Google's proxy instead of the one your ad blocker establishes. And that's really all there is to it. However, the Google App on iOS (Google Search + Now) will always proxy around an ad blocker. I don't know if it's a data saver that just can't be disabled (which would explain it) or malice on Google's part. I'm leaning toward the latter. But the fact remains, if I Google gaming stuff and go to a Wikia site, I get slammed with ads. If I Bing it, the ads don't show up. And Bing makes a great app. Shame fandroids slam it Because It's Not Google. Real shame. They're missing out. Jorge Adguard tells you what browsers work with adblockers on install. They only accept Yandex and Samsung Internet. There's no option to make it work with Chrome and I'm forced to install one of those if I want to continue with the installation. Anyways, I'll give it a try disabling data saver but it hasn't worked in the past with other ad blockers. Carsten AdGuard DOES work with Chrome, but not the browser-plugin adguard, you have to use the full app adguard. It even works with data saver, what confuses me, but it does. Necdet Ali Özdür Try Samsung Browser on mobile, it supports ad blocking. MJ I already have an ad blocker and no interest in the Samsung browser. LOL Hrishikesh Bisen Why? bekifft I've been impressed with Brave, it's basically uBlock plus https everywhere. Or Adguard if you must use Chrome. It's worth it. I wouldn't mind ads if they didn't try to hijack my phone and install malware. senor_heisenberg Noice, about time. Tom Erlandsen Google working on an ad-blocker? Now there's something I never expected to read haha JD Gotta finish off the competition somehow. They weren't going to do it by releasing polished products Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ LOL, unfortunately, true. My1 google releases polish products? do they also have a subcompany on Poland? SCNR. demarcmj He said "They weren't going to do it by releasing polished products" Bombaglad have you ever heard of editing comments? Jorge Yes, only Adsense will pass the "fair ad policy" and will be correctly displayed. All the other "your phone is full of viruses" won't be displayed. I will miss the sexy vibrations in my hand. :-( JG Does ChromeOS fall into the desktop category? or is this going to be browser only? kenspiracy ChromeOS would fall into the desktop category, yes. 4Ui812 Adgaurd for the win and the block. Untung Dwi Prasetyo Yes D.Smithee They make a great content blocker for Samsung browser--and let's face it, their Adguard VPN blocker for unrooted Android is a godsend. Cakefish I have a choice to use either the preinstalled Chrome browser or the preinstalled Samsung Internet browser on my phone. Samsung Internet supports adguard content blocker. Chrome does not. The choice is clear. In fact, it's hard to call it a choice. There is only one viable option to take. D.Smithee Did you not see my mention of the Adguard VPN that blocks ads in all browsers? So, yeah--you can use Chrome. Carsten I never thought I would pay for an ad blocker, but AdGuard ist sooooooo ♥ ♥ ♥ ! Also, right into the face of haters: "There is no get-everything-free-world today!" - "Dude, I'm actaully PAYING for not seeing ads!" :D Madis Surely you're paying, but who the money goes to is what matters... Carsten Yep, it is. You see, the argument against adblockers is: "There must be ads, otherwise everything would cost money and don't tell me you would pay for stuff online! Aha! So don't be an a-hole and disable your adblocker." But: I am paying! That's the point: Not just being a guy who wants everything for free, but saying "yes, I am okay with paying for good content." Problem is, websites with ads are no good content, while an adblocker is. Johny M This is not good. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/a6fddce77432d41dfcd3c6f79fcc7fa1244c36a5ce08a0227a141e8521e57f3e.gif So the biggest online add company will punish websites that post "bad" commercials. What can go wrong with that? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Exactly. Google ad services monopoly, here we come. Necdet Ali Özdür It's been done before. I mean blocking "bad" commercials. Almost all browsers now have an option to block pop up pages. I consider this an extension of it. rockstarr27 Google will use it to block non google approved ads, furthering their monopoly. Predictable. 4Ui812 Bingo MaroonMushroom All of the bigger advertising companies would probably meet Google's standards without issue. I'm sure the bar will be set low enough to mostly target the full screen ads that say your Android phone has 6 memory viruses while it's vibrating at you. rockstarr27 "Google will only block the bad ads, they wouldn't ever try to make their ad blocking more dominant compared to competitors with this move." - Ah to be young and naive. saf1927 Ah yes, because they want another antitrust case on them. As if Android weren't enough of a headache. Yep, really nice to be naive. LAMMJR O plz god yes, block those stupid ads that block chrome in android, spamming pop ups and using vibration saying my phone will be destroyed in x seconds if I don't install whaterver app they tell me to. Carson Saldanha Omg fr. I can't believe this is still a thing. Max I only can wish suffering to whoever developed those nasty ads. Nicoleckeys Google is paying 97$ per hour! Work for few hours & have longer with friends and family! !su184c: On tuesday I got a great new Land Rover Range Rover from having earned $8752 this last four weeks..

Mr.Bean ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I would think they put those ads for curious eyes. LOL Stop playing with yourself and these ads will disappear! Defenestratus Sadly it's not just porn sites that have those these days. LAMMJR This is not exclusive to porn sites, porn sites are probably worse. Any site that offers ad-suported download can end up having one of those annoying ads. For example, sites that uses ad.fly as url shortening can end up stuffing this type of ads on your face. Modest Mind I'm not sure Google will integrate an adblocker to Chrome because Google and Ads are synonymous. Unless Google integrates an add-blocker that has a "white list" and Google Ads are at the top of that list. demarcmj They're just blocking "bad" ads Randroid Read the article. It's going to be the opposite. It's going to be a blacklist of ads that are dangerous, annoying, or intrusive Modest Mind Annoying, intrusive? That is the definition of Google ad business... justmy2pennies2012 The ones the block what you are reading and stays oin the screen as you scroll down are the worst. alexb88 Use Adguard! YaKillaCJ Oh that sounds horrible. I didn't kno ads got that bad. Been using AdAway for years now. Latheryin Ads will never be accepted by everyone. A lot of people see no use for them at all and will continue to block all ads. If they wanted commercials they can watch cable. Max Be careful with what you wish, the day ads die is the day everything will be paid on internet. TechGuy22 Like pirate don't exist lol tookieboy stupid people do though. happy pirating your gmail account Latheryin Yeah that will never happen. Even if it cuts people's use of the Internet by 65% that would not be a bad thing. And like TechGuy22 said. It will be broken. DragoCubed I can see a future with less outright box ads and ads that are hard to even tell that they are ads. Sponsored content and stuff. TechGuy22 Block these ads or the hijacked one on here specially https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/1abd2d9979769332aaaefa91b671e6683737b8fb001f1b9b41820b6a94d1eee9.png Josh Crumley But look at this one weird trick I learned! https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/c8c0b953c6e85700fbc7f7073a9f5ec68cb6a87dbf0c0afbca12b88428163ea5.png ilovetesla seriously , try it , its very good and a healthy tip for the phone internet never lies Jorge That only works on iOS.

Totally worth it ilovetesla #FANTAPOWER Chris ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) How fantastic. Bruce Wayne Those ads are annoying. They are usually served up by a company called Outbrain. Jorge They're not that annoying. No other ads make your phone vibrate that sexy. Bruce Wayne Jorge, I'm going to need you to take your phone out of your pants. Jorge Why? I like the vibes inside my pants. They put me in the mood. Cakefish And Taboola and Revcontent jonzey231 "You'll never guess what she looks like now!!" Brian Kittelson I have add blocked these. Some of these are borderline NSFW. I don't need T&A ads while browsing a tech news website at work thank you. DragoCubed Awesome sauce LOL So no more pussiеs and тiтs on the side bar? Damn.... Michael Hazell Never thought I'd see the day that Google would assume the role as an ad blocker, but honestly I appreciate them filtering those ads on mobile devices where it's like "your device has 6 million viruses, install to fix." Those are just cancer and needed to be blocked anyways. I've been such a heavy ad blocker that I forgot what it's like to deal with cancerous ads on the internet. xmascarroll For some reason, my stock V20 always gets "Android Alert! Your device, GENERIC ANDROID DEVICE, has xxx viruses! Run Android GENERIC ANDROID DEVICE Cleaner now!" D.Smithee We'll assume you didn't run said cleaner. ilovetesla then, follow the instructions, its a generic cleaner Jorge What are you waiting for? Go do that right now. Your phone and your bank account will appreciate that. YuCMi Yes please! If this works the way it is described here, I'll turn off my indiscriminate adblocker. Dmitry Stepanushkin ADBlock. Problem solved 😂 Lord Argyris Somehow I'm categorizing this one in the "I'll believe it when I see it" category. It sounds an awful lot like an Outbrain story, which, incidentally enough, is one of the reasons people run ad blockers. That all said, these are the kinds of things I want to see blocked: -Anything that autoplays, makes noise, etc. -Anything that blinks, pops up, obscures the screen, or otherwise tries to distract me -Clickbait repos -Any and all forms of tracking--leave ad content selection up to the host site, or just push random ads The first two might be reasonably expected from a hypothetical Google ad blocker, but the third is questionable (the stories don't usually run afoul of the other criteria on the list; they're just trashy and take up page space and bandwidth). For the last one, however, I can barely hear myself typing over the laughter of the big ad companies (Google included). Tracking makes ads much more effective, and I don't see anything (apart from federal regulation, which has its own problems, not to mention scope limitations) that will ever manage to shove that genie back into the bottle. I'll play along with the rumor for a moment. What Google is likely doing here is protecting not just its ad revenue, but its ability to build up tracking data, which is immensely valuable. Trackers can be blocked by sufficiently motivated individuals, and third party extensions make this a lot easier. This is where Google wants to move in. By offering a basic solution to casual ad blockers, who just don't want to deal with the annoyance and page slowdown of heavily ad-infested sites, Google is ensuring that those tracking cookies are still set and that it (Google) and other third party ad companies can keep harvesting that data, even if people aren't seeing as many annoying ads. As an end user, this benefits me in some ways and hurts me in others. On the one hand, I feel like the presence of a Chrome-native, on-by-default blocker will bring about at least some progress on eradicating the Internet of the worst ad offenders, particularly if the penalty for non-compliance is that your site gets no revenue whatsoever from Chrome users who stick with the defaults. On the other hand, this will put the squeeze on more capable third party extensions that offer more granular control (as well as the ability to block more than just the ads themselves), which might drive some of them out of the market. Also, it abstracts the issue of tracking away from ad blocking--everybody can see the ads (and be creeped out at how relevant they are), but fewer people know about the tracking behind the scenes. If Google just makes some of the most annoying ads go away, many people will be satisfied, even if the tracking is still taking place. It also seems dangerously close to the sort of anticompetitive behavior commonly associated with late 90s-era Microsoft, since it's clear Google isn't being altruistic here. It's going to benefit from this initiative, and disproportionately to the other players in the market (both ad blockers and other ad companies). Notice what's not ever going to be blocked: Google-sourced ads. Everything else is theoretically fair game. Companies looking to advertise, as well as sites looking for ad revenue, will both be more confident in going with the Google ad platform than with competitors because they know that their ads will be compliant and that they won't risk losing revenue due to Google's ad blocker. We'll see how this shakes out. If a Chrome ad blocker is indeed under consideration, I suspect this information was purposely leaked to see what sort of reaction it gets. ast00 Block ads? Yes, please. Only accept AdSense? Oh hell no! (please link the gif) bozzykid The report says it will use the same "Acceptable Ads" that Adblock Plus supports so it wouldn't be accepting just Adsense. tookieboy don't bother.. people don't read ast00 I know what it says, but Google is no stranger to uncompetitive tactics. bozzykid I'm not sure you can read. The report makes it clear. Cory Wilson I want to be rid of the stupid ads that take over the whole screen and say "congratulations we're giving away giftcards to users who live in , you have 5 minutes to redeem". you can't get out of them unless you close the window and reopen. Anonymous and what about adsense? My1 well I think google isnt stupid enough to make adsense that bad so it would fall under the blocking guidelines, I mean adsense ads I saw were iirc usually just banners on the top, bottom or side. cr08 Yeah. Adsense has always been really lean and unobstrusive with their ads. I'd be happy with allowing adsense ads and also ads from other networks that are also unobtrusive. Hopefully with Google's knack for self learning algorithims they can nail this down. D.Smithee It's good news--but a little too late, Google. I've been using a content blocker since the very early 2000's with Firefox. Now I use uBlock Origin with Chrome desktop. I came to the conclusion a LONG time ago that sites don't have our best interests at heart. Even the ones that proclaim they do. For me, ads/trackers/etc. became a security issue quite some time ago--I just can't trust sites, so I just block ALL ads/trackers/undesirable content. And if a site objects to it or blocks users using content blockers, I just get my information elsewhere. It's that simple. Branko So awesome. Will it eventually filter "hate speech" and "fake news" too Google? If you want to place in a mechanism for ad blocking, users must have control over it. Otherwise it's prone to abuse of self interests. Go fuck yourselves Google. Disphouf Thats funny, I changed Chrome with Brave browser because their adblocker givitumibeybi lol. I can't understand why everyone is so excited. This will just be an Embrace, Extend, and Extinguish move. Kwetsima Maluleke Wow Google. Not bad. Its not like Samsung and Apple haven't had ad blockers for years now. givitumibeybi What's the difference between morals of using torrents to install overpriced things for free, and using adblockers to get access to the content of a website with disturbing advertisements for free? Cakefish - Taboola - Outbrain - Revcontent ^ THIS SCOURGE OF THE INTERNET MUST BE DESTROYED!!! I will not retire the use of my adblocker until those companies are wiped off the face of the planet. Truly, they are evil incarnate. They must die in a pit of flaming fury. Morten Ulv I wonder what happens on pages that block people from reading if they have an ad blocker. My mother would surely not know what to do. Markus Birth The fun thing is: Once EVERY Chrome user gets blocked from viewing those pages, they will very soon die or turn off their adblock-blocker. Better for everyone. Zach Mauch Hopefully it will also fight against adds using excessive processing. That is the major reason I still run it on sites as prominent as Android Central. They can just destroy performance. jonzey231 I could see this turning an anti-competition suit very quickly. It wouldn't be intentional but it would end up being Google blocking their own competitor's ads while allowing their own to flourish. It'll be seen the same as Android using only Google as the default search provider...and that definitely hasn't gone well for them abroad. Mark Curtis ALL ads are bad, I'm entitled to free content, gimme gimme gimme Chris Sanner I'll be honest - if they do this, I'd probably disable my other ad blocker entirely. I don't mind ALL ads, it's the ones that are COMPLETELY obnoxious that cause me to block the rest. currently most hated? the ones that show up as you scroll through a story and you have to scroll through them to get back to scrolling the site. John Petersen No way. This is just asking for abuse and conflicts of interest. Just enable add-ons for mobile, and let unvested third parties take care of the ad-blocking. PVL_93_RU I'm waiting to see how advertisement companies find a way around this built-in blocking LOL I am using adblocker via router so all devices connected are blocked BC This would be a lovely thing because I only disdain the annoying adverts that pop up and block my screen...Banners aren't bad as I can see those without having content obscured, also Google needs to get better at blocking the ads that cause redirects. Those really piss me off. PIucky Duck 🇩🇪 Rooted phone with AdAway is the way to go F4LL0U7 FYI, Adguard for Android is awesome. No root required. They have a desktop Chrome extension too, if you like having your ad blockers match across all devices. Michael Payton Endgame will be to block all ads not sold thru Google. That's how they make most of they're money, and other people will have to advertise thru them to get their ads seen. Vivek Rameses Don't be fooled, all ads are bad. YaKillaCJ Or here's a better idea, allow extensions in mobile. Maybe keep it in the beta to keep away the average person or at least express its a little advance. Brandon Good! Google is the ONLY ad network I trust to not contain malware. Until these websites properly audit their ad content and ensure it's not laden with malware then I will continue running an ad-blocker and a DNS blackhole. Anyone with a Pi checkout PiHole. bekifft If only Google offered some sort of service that would let you pay them money to block the ads...you'd still contribute to the sites, but only the ones that serve Google ads. They could call it something like... Google Contributor maybe? Just a crazy idea... I know I'd use it...

Those of you with a husband or kids or a roommate will appreciate Google Home's latest update. If you've ever said to the speaker "OK Google, good morning", you know it will tell you the time, weather, schedule, and news. But if you didn't set up Google Home with your Google account (maybe it's set up under your son's account), then you won't hear results that are meant for you. You'll get someone else's schedule, news, and music preferences. However, starting 20 April 2017, that's no longer an issue. Google Home now lets up to six people connect their account to one Google Home speaker. So, when you ask Google Assistant for help going forward, it'll be able to distinguish your voice from your son's or husband's or daughter's or roommate's and switch to the right account. You'll get your own playlists, schedule, and more. Here's everything you need to know. Google Home review: Better than Amazon Echo? What is Google Assistant and how does it work? 7 best Google Home compatible devices you can buy today Google Home: How to add multiple users First, make sure you're using the latest version of the Google Home app on your mobile device. Getting started When you open the app, look for a card that says ”multi-user is available”. If you don’t see a card, click on the icon in the top right to see all of your connected devices. Once you see your Google Home listed, select “Link your account.” Voice training The app will prompt you to teach Google Assistant your voice so that it can understand and recognize you when you speak. It will ask you to say the phrases "Ok Google" and "Hey Google" two times each. Google said those phrases are analyzed by a neural network that can detect certain characteristics of a person's voice in a matter of milliseconds. Preferences You’ll also need to set up your preferences within the Google Home app (such as personalized music and commutes).

Tech Search Search WMPWThe World’s Most Powerful Women: April 21 VerizonWhy Verizon Is Putting Actual Employees in Its New TV Ads Digital HealthElon Musk Outlines His Mission to Link Human Brains With Computers in 4 Years steel industryU.S. Steel Stocks Surge as Trump Launches a Probe Into Cheap Chinese Imports Michael Short — Bloomberg via Getty Images Google Google Just Added This Important Feature to Its Amazon Echo-Rival Leena Rao Apr 20, 2017 Google added a major new feature on Thursday to its home automation device, Google Home—the ability to distinguish between different voices in a household. The upgrade means family members or roommates will be able to use the device to play their own music or get their day's schedule without having to manually switch accounts within an app. Google Home is an Internet-connected speaker that lets users search for information like the weather, traffic, and their daily schedule by using their voices. The device is powered by the company’s voice assistant, Google Assistant, which responds to questions and can connect to things like personal calendars and Gmail accounts to provide personalized information to users who ask. Google Home is a challenger to Amazon (“amzn”) Echo, a connected speaker that does much of the same thing. The big drawback to the six-month old Google Home is that it lacks some of those features available in Amazon Echo, which premiered a year earlier. Get Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter. Today, Google Home closed some of that gap with the Echo. Echo and Alexa lets multiple account holders integrate their music and Amazon shopping accounts, for example. However, to switch between accounts on Echo, users must specifically tell Alexa to do so while Google now automatically tells the difference between different voices. For more on Google, watch: To add various accounts to the Home, users must go into the Google Home mobile app and link accounts for up to six users for one device. From there, Google says that the Assistant will automatically learn to distinguish different voices. When someone starts speaking to Home with "Okay, Google" or "Hey, Google," the device compares the voice to previous voices it has heard and determines its identity—all in a matter of milliseconds. This feature will start rolling out today for Google Home users in the U.S., and will expand to the U.K. in the coming months, the company said.

Skip to content Publishers fear fallout of Google-backed ad blocker News Podcasts Pulse Events Careers Sections News Podcasts Pulse Events Careers Hot Topics The Platform Effect Marketing on Platforms Brands in Culture Modern Newsroom Agency Culture Video Anywhere Retail Revolution Categories Media Marketing Publishers fear fallout of Google-backed ad blocker Duopoly Video Anywhere Brands in Culture The Confessions Media Marketing Ad Blocking Wars Publishers fear fallout of Google-backed ad blocker April 20, 2017 by Jessica Davies and Lucia Moses Publishers are responding to a Wall Street Journal report that Google is reportedly launching an ad blocker for Chrome with official cheer but private skepticism and fear. Officially — and on the record — publishers are genuflecting at the altar of user experience, welcoming moves by Google or other companies to improve online advertising. But go on background, conversations turn to the inevitable imbalance of power when it comes to the duopoly of Facebook and Google. And for some, the move smacks of hypocrisy. Here’s Google, vacuuming up the largest share of digital advertising, positioning itself as the arbiter of what ads constitute a poor user experience. Don’t expect a half page of ads at the top of a search results page to get dinged, no matter the third-party Google officially christens as the standard bearer. “A monopoly which is already not affected by ad blocking in general because of paid whitelisting having more power is scary,” said Meagan Lopez, global digital business director for The New York Times. “Owning every aspect of the advertising world from tech to search to exchanges to measurement to servers to ad blocking within the browser just means less control again for everyone else.” Google is yet to make an official announcement, but the Journal reported that Google’s criteria for what ads should be blocked, stems from the industry committee-led Coalition for Better Ads, of which Google is a founding member. That means pop-ups and autoplaying video ads with sound, and “prestitial” ads with countdown timers, formats which the Coalition has previously deemed unacceptable, could be blocked. Most wouldn’t object to these particular ads, but these type of things tend to snowball. And these days, few publishers are in the mood to give any platform carte blanche. One scenario Google is considering is to block all advertising that appear on sites with offending ads, instead of just the offending ads themselves, per the Journal. One publisher who’s talked to Google said that Google has already decided it will take the preemptive approach, though. That in and of itself is enough to set off alarm bells. “We’re all waiting to see if any ads we have would be considered noncompliant,” said another publisher, speaking anonymously. While many publishers share Google’s interests in keeping the web safe for digital advertising, publishers aren’t without fear of Google’s dominance. The Coalition is described as a big tent, with Google being a founding member, but some members privately say they consider the Coalition to essentially be a front for Google. As evidence of the search giant’s power, many publishers contacted for this story said they were under strict NDA with Google not to breathe a word about the ad blocking plans. That alone speaks volumes to the power dynamic at play here. Google briefing publishers, not asking for collaboration here. Certainly no one thinks Google will block ads on its own YouTube, but the fear is that it could block ads on a whim. “That’s frightening,” Lopez said. “Not only that, but if they intend to block entire sites that have one bad ad, what is the process for being white listed? How do you get back in their good graces?” Digiday Publishing Summit September 25 - 27, 2017 Key Biscayne, FL REGISTER NOW Sponsored Infographic: Native is scaling, 45 percent of brands now buy programmatic Sponsored by Nativo The issue raises clear antitrust concerns. Google is at the very least a dominant player in digital advertising. Using that power to an unfair advantage would prick the ears of regulators, if not in a Trump administration than certainly in the more interventionist European Union. If nothing else, a Google ad blocker could put the onus on publishers to clean up the web (although the fact that it’d be Google making them do it makes it easier to sell it to advertisers). “If I’m a publisher, Google can afford to serve a ransom on publishers,” said Patrick Keane, president of Sharethrough and a former top Google ad exec. “Chrome is the largest browser in market. Publishers would have to sacrifice monetization dollars.” Ironically, Google already pays Eyeo, owner of the popular ad blocker AdblockPlus, to whitelist sites as part of the German company’s “Acceptable Ads” program. Will Google keep paying to have its products whitelisted, said Pete Wootton, managing director of digital for Dennis Publishing. He also wondered if the ad block move will lead to Google making its fast-loading article protocol, Accelerated Mobile Pages, the default for all devices. Others wonder if Google will next move to dictate how sponsored content is labeled. Google hasn’t made an official announcement about its intentions, only issuing a statement saying: “We do not comment on rumor or speculation. We’ve been working closely with the Coalition for Better Ads and industry trades to explore a multitude of ways Google and other members of the Coalition could support the Better Ads Standards​.”​ Some see plenty to be positive about. “It is great for premium publishers, as it will help to shut off the demand going toward low quality, highly intrusive inventory and shift the pre-roll market to entirely skippable ads,” said one U.S. publisher. “It’s not ad blocking all commercial content, just rubbish commercial content,” said Simon Haynes, digital director at Northern & Shell, owner of the Express newspapers. “If they screw supply and publishers they ultimately have no business, and they’re unlikely to do that. Their business is based on the facilitation of advertising.” Some said another consequence of Google blocking bad ads, unintended or not, could be to cut off the revenue of shady websites that help fund the content recommendation engines that gunk up many publishers’ article pages. “This could be targeted to the Outbrains and Taboolas of the world, which have become real important oxygen for publishers,” Keane said. “This could be an effort to force the hand of those.” And yet, others worry that if Google goes ahead with these plans, it will undermine publishers’ own progress in reducing ad blocking. Chrome has just under 60 percent of the internet browsing market, according to NetMarketShare. “We may now have to have two ad blocking strategies, one for Chrome and another for everything else,” said John Barnes, chief digital officer at magazine group Incisive Media and former chairman of the Association of Online Publishers. Many publishers have staunched the flow of ad blocking on their sites by improving the user experience and communicating with them to understand why they’re blocking ads. Their approaches have ranged from preventing ad blocker users from accessing their site, serving pop-ups to inform users why they need advertising, or asking them to donate or subscribe. For others, it’s meant culling ad tech vendor partners and making pages load faster. Pop-up ads, which have long been deemed intrusive, will be among the type to be reportedly blocked by Chrome. Given publishers have been serving notices to users with ad blockers switched on, via pop-up messages, that is a concern for Barnes. “Why should someone who makes the browsers make the decision, when they themselves are so embedded in the ecosystem?” he said. One thing is clear: ad blocking will require collective attention from the industry, regardless of what Google does. “While these developments will help to promote good formats, it’s unclear how they will deal with the gaming of good formats, with bad dynamic creatives, which we have seen being served through mainstream programmatic exchanges,” said Hamish Nicklin, chief revenue officer at Guardian News and Media. “While this could be a good step it won’t solve all the problems with the digital ecosystem. We also need to reconnect readers with the value that good advertising plays in funding high-quality journalism, whilst also finding news ways to help those readers who don’t want advertising to contribute to that journalism financially.” Related Articles Business Insider fights ad blocking in the UK with whitelists, micropayments and subscriptions March 10, 2017 by Ross Benes ‘Everyone has been wary’: Inside the Adblock Plus ‘acceptable ads’ committee March 17, 2017 by Ross Benes The Platform Effect Pinpricks: Why Pinterest and publishers aren’t getting along April 21, 2017 by Max Willens The Platform Effect HowStuffWorks is going long — and making money — with Amazon video April 21, 2017 by Sahil Patel Video Anywhere How lifestyle publisher Shortlist Media is increasing weekly video production from 5 to 60 April 21, 2017 by Lucinda Southern Sponsored State of the Industry: Powering programmatic video Sponsored by Teads Beyond Ads Thanks to surprise British election, The Spectator triples daily subscriber sales April 20, 2017 by Jessica Davies The Platform Effect Publishers are seeing another big decline in reach on Facebook April 20, 2017 by Lucia Moses Subscribe To Digiday Pulse Join Digiday Pulse and get Digiday Magazine with your membership.

Those of you with a husband or kids or a roommate will appreciate Google Home's latest update. If you've ever said to the speaker "OK Google, good morning", you know it will tell you the time, weather, schedule, and news. But if you didn't set up Google Home with your Google account (maybe it's set up under your son's account), then you won't hear results that are meant for you. You'll get someone else's schedule, news, and music preferences. However, starting 20 April 2017, that's no longer an issue. Google Home now lets up to six people connect their account to one Google Home speaker. So, when you ask Google Assistant for help going forward, it'll be able to distinguish your voice from your son's or husband's or daughter's or roommate's and switch to the right account. You'll get your own playlists, schedule, and more. Here's everything you need to know. Google Home review: Better than Amazon Echo?

(PRWEB)—At this year’s Webby Awards— the Academy Awards for website design — a team of up-and-comers is taking on the corporate giants. Motiv, a San Francisco-based venture that makes an award-winning smart ring, received a nomination in the Advertising, Media & PR Products and Services category. Their competitors in this category are Adidas, Uber, Google, and Project Muze (a collaboration between Google and fashion retailer Zolando). What makes this nomination even more atypical is that Motiv’s website was not produced by a large agency, but by a tight-knit coalition of up-and-coming creative professionals and boutique shops. The team includes Marketing Strategist David Sperry, independent Creative Director Anthony Wiktor, web development team Dirango led by Diran Yanikian, and video production studio Friendly Filmworks led by Ara Soudjian. Operating out of a converted studio in the Hollywood Media District, the team set out to “capture Motiv’s combination of fashion and technology in a responsive interactive site,” says Wiktor. “It took a lot of sleepless nights, but we created a digital experience with the same feel and polish that the big agencies deliver,” says Yanikian. David Sperry, principal of marketing consultancy, Mutant Unicorn, the agency responsible for selecting the trio of shops, noted that he originally reached out to Wiktor and his team because of their “visionary, modern aesthetic. I trusted them with bringing the Motiv brand from idea to reality and it paid off.” Sperry notes that the team’s work was singled out as one of the five best in the world in its category (and among the top 9% of all work entered). As a nominee, Motiv is also eligible to win a Webby People’s Voice Award, which is voted online by fans across the globe. From now until April 20th, Motiv fans can cast their votes at voteformotiv.com “We enjoy working with companies like Motiv that are trying to challenge the status quo because that’s part of our DNA too. We’re looking forward to earning the votes from all those who like supporting the underdog,” adds Soudjian. Winners will be announced on Tuesday, April 25, 2017, and honored at a star-studded ceremony on Monday, May 15, 2017, at Cipriani on Wall Street in New York City. There they will have an opportunity to deliver one of The Webby Awards’ famous 5-Word Speeches. Past 5-Word Speeches include: Steve Wilhite’s “It’s Pronounced “Jif” not ‘Gif’; Stephen Colbert’s “Me. Me. Me. Me. Me.”; and Björk ‘s “A E I O U.” Founded in 2013 and based in San Francisco, Motiv Ring is the first highly advanced wearable device that changes the way people measure activity and sleep. The Motiv Ring won Best of Innovation at the 2017 Consumer Electronics Show. For more information, see http://mymotiv.com.

Google Home Now Recognizes Specific Users’ Voices, Allows For Multiple Accounts Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share Google Home Now Recognizes Specific Users’ Voices, Allows For Multiple Accounts April 20, 2017 2:03 pm EDT By Chris Morran@themorrancave Alexa amazon apple google Google Home pardon my google privacy siri In a move to differentiate its Google Home voice-activated assistant from competitors like Apple’s Siri, Amazon’s Alexa, or Microsoft’s Clippy (yes, we know it’s Cortana, but we prefer Clippy), Google has tweaked its Google Home assistant to allow for multiple users, each of whom can supposedly be uniquely identified by their voice. This is not a shock to folks who noticed that a recent update to the Home app on Android included a mention of the ability to have multiple accounts, but today the company confirmed the news and showed how you go about setting up your specific voice recognition. In terms of setup, it’s relatively simple, if the new feature has been rolled out to your Home app, when you launch it you’ll be asked to repeat the phrase “Ok, Google” three times. So when you later talk to your Google Home hub it should be able to distinguish your voice — and therefore any apps, contacts, or preferences you have linked to your account — from others who also use that Home hub. Google gives the example of a family where two busy parents can each ask the same Home device what their schedule is like for the day, without having to identify themselves, switch accounts, or press any buttons. While we were able to set up user-specific voice recognition on an Android device, the Consumerist HQ is lacking in a Google Home hub so we don’t yet know how well the multi-user experience is playing out. We know some families with siblings who have remarkably similar voices, so we’re definitely curious to see how it works in those homes — or if recordings or particularly good impersonations will suffice in tricking Google Home into coughing up someone else’s info. Each Home hub will be able to recognize up to six different unique voices, so if you have a really large family, little Timmy is out of luck. Sorry kid; send your tears to Google. The ability to recognize individual users doesn’t lock out others from being able to access your Home hub. Guests — and even Burger King ads — will still be able to trigger actions like web searches without having their voices registered on that particular device. While this may be a convenience for households with multiple people who feel compelled to shout requests to disembodied virtual assistants, it also ramps up the privacy concerns. Previously, Google would know what sort of searches, requests, and directions you gave to Home, but it never knew if it was specifically you or just anyone within microphone range who wanted to hear a summary of the Wikipedia entry on Botswana. Now it knows with some certainty that it was you — or your husband, or your cousin Ralph — who made that request. Individual voice-recognition seems like the logical next step for Amazon’s Alexa, but not necessarily for Apple and Siri. The Apple voice assistant is mostly targeted at mobile users — iPhones, iPads, Apple Watches — where there is minimal use in having multiple people shouting orders into the same microphone.

The new phone is better in almost every respect than its predecessors but there are still some issues to nitpick about. In such a beautifully crafted device that has industry-leading specs it's not easy to find faults, but there certainly are some. As always has been the case, Samsung is not necessarily a good software company, despite it excels in industrial design and can stand against pretty much any company toe to toe specifications-wise. The newest phone definitely showcases the company's technological prowess as well as industrial design especially with exclusive edge displays. However, the UI is again pretty ugly, and comes with apps that are not really needed. One of these apps that are pretty much carbon copies of Google's offerings, already found on the Android device as well obviously, is the new assistant software Bixby. Even though Bixby is pretty much exactly what the Google Assistant offers, it's not the software implementation that makes it frustrating for us customers – we can always choose not to use the app. It is the fact that Samsung has added a completely new button on the side of the device that opens up Bixby. Well, you might as, why would an additional functionality be so bad? First of all, adding more buttons is not necessarily a good thing. Secondly the button takes to a service that is currently crippled and seems to not be as good as Google Assistant. Even this might be acceptable, even a good thing, if you could program the button to do something else. Samsung does not include this option in their UI but some people have hacked the option to Android phones. Unfortunately Samsung has just made the worst decision for its new flagship. According to XDA forums, Samsung has completely disabled all the user customizations of this button and it can now definitely be used only for Bixby. One might see the positives in this and hope that Bixby will come around and actually be good, but this is hardly any consolation to people who do not use their phone in any Bixby supported language. There is some hope still, though, some people with review units have said that the remapping hasn't been disabled. Also rumors have it that the remapping option might be available depending on the region or carrier. Obviously for non-English speaking world this would be the most important. We'll just have to wait and see how Samsung deals with this.

Multi-user voice recognition is rolling out to Google Home today Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/04/20 9:01am PDTApr 20, 2017 70 Plus 1 on G+ 125 Share on Facebook 89 Share on Twitter Total Shares284 Google News Videos Update 1: 2017/04/20 12:02pm PDT Here is the setup flow, courtesy of Artem Russakovskii: Bringing Google Assistant out of the phone and dropping it into Google Home comes with some difficulties. Not the least of which is, how do you handle personal account preferences and data when Google Home is available to everyone in the house? Until now the solution has been "don't." Starting today, you can register multiple users with your Google home, which recognizes them by voice. To set this up. look for a device card in the Home app that says"Multi-user is now available" or "Link your account." The setup process has you say the "OK Google" and "Hey Google" hotwords twice each. From then on, Google Home will be able to provide personal results because it knows who you are. The same is true for up to five other people in the house. The personal results affected by multi-user include My Day, calendars, flights, shopping lists, photos, and more. Each user of Google Home will also be asked to set some preferences for things like video and music services. If you set up a new user and don't do that, Google Home just defaults to the ones used by the first account. You can get started fiddling around with this today, but only in the US. Multi-user will roll out to the UK in the coming months.

Evolutionary at best. cusaitech Will this prevent ads from activating Google home? Jonathan Berry I believe unrecognized users will continue to work, just without the personalization it can do if it recognizes you. Shagnscooby I'm wondering if you can specify the default account if it's an unrecognized person. The biggest reason I've been looking forward to this is because of someone in my house using the Google Home for music with GPM and me in the car listening and it stops playing because of simultaneous streams. I'd probably specify one of my kids as the default account so it never overlaps my listening. Kakairo Yes! Can't wait to set this up when I get home. Hopefully adding calendar events and reminders isn't far behind. Carson Saldanha Roll out... :( Kakairo I've been lucky with roll outs lately, hopefully that streak continues. surethom UK coming month not good. Will this FINALLY let us ask for my music uploaded by artist name & song to play without a subscription? Defenestratus Thank goodness. I'm really sick of having my wife's terrible music selections showing up as recommendations in GPM. MrCalifornia If my wife doesn't have her own Google Music subscription can she not play music on Google Home anymore? Lisarbeams Managing director of Google!, is explaining to users to start off "Work at home" method, that People have been doing for about one year now. These days alone, I generated close to $36,000 until now with no more than my home computer as well as some spare time, despite that i have a fulltime 9 to 5 job. Even everyone not used to this, can make $89/per h easily and the earnings can go even higher over time... This is how i started !wr241c: ➽➽ ➽➽➽➽ http://GoogleFinancialCashJobs241BuzzGlobal/GetPaid$97/Hour... ★✫★★✫★✫★★✫★✫★★✫★✫★★✫★✫★★✫★✫★★✫★✫★★✫★✫★★✫★✫★★✫★✫★★✫★✫★★✫:::!wr241u:..... surethom So each person has to upload all there music to each account for Playlists to work? Or can you ask for any Playlists from somone else's music uploaded? Still Google. Does not explain properly. trickytree1984 Same question Scott Olsen I'm guessing I still won't be able to link my work account to my personal account so that I can get both calendar events when I ask about my day. M. Luciano Not without sharing your calendar to the other account. F4LL0U7 My IT department blocks sharing our work calendars externally. gSyncit is the only thing that worked for me, and it works great. I love getting my work meeting agenda & reminders on my personal phone & watch. Check it out. http://www.fieldstonsoftware.com/software/gsyncit4/ lgg4 On this note, whats the best way to manage a gapps vs gmail account? I have my calendar, google drive and play store apps all on my gapps acocunt, but gplay music and non-business stuff on my gmail. Shoudl i try to transfer everything over to my consumer gmail account and just share my biz calendar to personal? I ask this as features seem to be limited at times with gapps accounts and when i linked my gapps with Home (due to my calendar), it says it cannot access my agenda. David Hyman Will this allow me to use my Spotify account on my phone while my wife uses hers on our Google home? jonzey231 As long as she specifies her Spotify account under her profile, I wouldn't see why not. David Hyman If that's the case it would solve such a first world problem for us! Let's hope that's how it works jonzey231 My brother is adding my Fiancee and I to his GPM family plan right now so we can take advantage of this. Previously, we had a $10/mo GPM sub using a shared gmail account. jonzey231 Will be doing this as soon as I get home from work. dcdttu OMG adorable gay couple in ad because Google wants me to buy 1 of these for every square foot of my house. <3 morteum IS THAT THE PIXEL 2???

Morten Ulv My 6P is over two years old and I have both the battery and the bootloop issue. Luckily, in my Norway, phones (and most electronics) have by law a 5 year "extended warranty" (from the seller, not the manufacturer) to protect consumers from issues like this. NexusPhan You're posting on the wrong article. Also, no your 6P is not over two years old as it wasn't released two years ago. Morten Ulv Guess I fucked that up. I bought it used, and my reciept is from march 2015, so that's why. Maybe the preorder date or an error. benjammin03 What does it do with an unrecognized voice? Does it default to a primary account? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ "Google Home Problems With Multi-User Voice, Google Is Looking Into It" Story to be published in 5... 4... 3... Bill Van I can't wait to see if this multi-user update will work with my twin brother. Our voices are so close that we have always had a tough time trying to figure out who is speaking during many recording. I guess I'll find out later this evening but for now my fingers are crossed..... rslh This would be interesting to know. Google is smart, but not sure if it's THAT smart! I would think assigning different hot words for each user would be ideal, but what do I know. trickytree1984 So why the UK delay? Why can i ask my phone for my agenda from my exchange calendar but not my home? Will my wife still be able to use my GPM subscription? Deeco US only, In the coming months, End of Q4, Rolling out in a couple weeks... We are tired of this shit Google!!! Shai Pal Anyone succeeded in doing this outside of U.S? Morten Ulv One should think that it's language (US vs UK) restricted and not location, though from their wording, it seems to be location based. I want to import one soon, so hopefully I'll be able to use these features and not having to wait. Shai Pal My setup is US english and a US google account. Nothing here... selonmoi Me in November: "Well, at least it'll probably be available in Canada by the time they get multi-user voice recognition working." Me now: _(ツ)_/¯ whispy_snippet Now Google, please fix voice unlock on the Pixel because it works roughly 50% of the time. xuohtx Wait? Separate shopping lists now? froemer I wonder if multi-user would also make it so that my kids can't adjust the thermostat or mess with the lights? JG OK, now that we have multi-user support... Can we have multi-Home support as well? If I'm in the living room, I only want the living room Home to respond, I don't need the one in my bedroom rattling off information as well.

Those of you with a husband or kids or a roommate will appreciate Google Home's latest update. If you've ever said to the speaker "OK Google, good morning", you know it will tell you the time, weather, schedule, and news. But if you didn't set up Google Home with your Google account (maybe it's set up under your son's account), then you won't hear results that are meant for you. You'll get someone else's schedule, news, and music preferences. However, starting 20 April 2017, that's no longer an issue. Google Home now lets up to six people connect their account to one Google Home speaker. So, when you ask Google Assistant for help going forward, it'll be able to distinguish your voice from your son's or husband's or daughter's or roommate's and switch to the right account. You'll get your own playlists, schedule, and more. Here's everything you need to know. Google Home review: Better than Amazon Echo? What is Google Assistant and how does it work? 7 best Google Home compatible devices you can buy today Google Home: How to add multiple users First, make sure you're using the latest version of the Google Home app on your mobile device. Getting started When you open the app, look for a card that says ”multi-user is available”. If you don’t see a card, click on the icon in the top right to see all of your connected devices. Once you see your Google Home listed, select “Link your account.” Voice training The app will prompt you to teach Google Assistant your voice so that it can understand and recognize you when you speak. It will ask you to say the phrases "Ok Google" and "Hey Google" two times each. Google said those phrases are analyzed by a neural network that can detect certain characteristics of a person's voice in a matter of milliseconds. Preferences You’ll also need to set up your preferences within the Google Home app (such as personalized music and commutes). You can learn more about how to adjust your preferences from Google's Help hub. Google: How does multiuser support work? Google said Google Assistant on Google Home should recognise you going forward and be personalised to you - from music to news.

The addition of multi-user support means that Google Home will now tailor its answers for each person and know which account to pull data from based on their voice.

Lisa Felepchuk - Apr 20 Facebook Twitter Pinterest + Linkedin WhatsApp Email SHARE THIS Facebook Twitter Pinterest Linkedin WhatsApp Email Remember how much fun you had when Google Earth was first released? Most people lost at least one entire morning at work trying to spot the house they grew up in, or scoping out a city they’d always wanted to visit. Well, bad news for bosses everywhere, because a new and improved version of Google Earth has arrived. And you’re going to want to go ahead and block off a few hours in your calendar to test it out. Take a look: If that doesn’t ease your wanderlust, nothing will. The new version has been in development for two years and uses upgraded satellite imagery to provide users with an extremely detailed, 3D view of the planet. Until now, this 3D feature was only available to certain locations. Ever seen the lake palaces in Udaipur, India? Well, now you have. Google Earth “With the new Earth, we want to open up different lenses for you to see the world and learn a bit about how it all fits together; to open your mind with new stories while giving you a new perspective on the locations and experiences you cherish,” wrote Google Earth’s product manager Gopal Shah in a post on Google’s official blog. “It’s everything you love about Google Earth, plus new ways for you to explore, learn and share. Zoom in and see what adventures await you in the new Google Earth.” One of the new features include an “I feel lucky” button (similar to the one on Google’s search page) that takes you to a new spot somewhere on earth for a curated view — there are 20,000 of these in total, so feel free to click away. Plus, Google Earth is now offering a tool called Voyager, which hosts guided nature tours narrated by Sir David Attenborough… and there goes your afternoon. Google Earth The updated version is currently accessible on the web in Chrome and on Android (it’ll be coming for iOS soon, too). Have fun exploring the world through your laptop… but try to at least get a bit of work done today.

Google Evan Selleck Contributing Editor | April 20, 2017 5 shares 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 1 2               Late last year, Google made a declaration: Things would be changing in how it launches phones. For many years now the company has had the Nexus program to host its dreams, which promoted a stock version of Android more than anything else. That option propelled, and held, the Nexus program in high esteem throughout the years, even when the hardware wasn't that great, or when a launch was bungled in one way or another. Things changed last year, though. The Nexus program, for all intents and purposes, is apparently gone, and instead we've got a renewed vigor for the Pixel brand. What started in other markets other than smartphones has now led the way for what Google can accomplish, set a new high standard for Android as a whole, and even blew away the competition with its camera -- both on a hardware and software front. The Google Pixel, and Google Pixel XL, are high-end flagship phones that deserve all of the praise they received last year. And it's exciting to see what Google will do next. Will the Pixel 2 revolutionize the design? Offer slimmer bezels, an even better camera, and more? Or will Google take a more held-back approach with an iterative upgrade? That being said, the phone market moves quickly, and, sometimes, there's a new piece of hardware to stare at just a few months after one high-end phone's arrival. That's certainly the case this year. The Pixel launched just before the end of 2016, with shipments and inventory being constrained for many, and here we are near the end of April --just a few months later-- and Samsung has the Galaxy S8 to show off to the world. I know of at least two people who picked up the Pixel as soon as they could, and have loved their phone ever since they took it out of the box. At least one of them constantly shares photos they've taken with the phone, practically glowing at the results. The other is just a huge fan of the phone in general. And both of them are picking up a Galaxy S8. In fact, one of them got their order shipped to them early, so they've got a Galaxy S8 Plus in hand. The other has to wait until tomorrow, but he's already sold his Pixel XL off. In both cases they managed to spend some hands-on time with the Galaxy S8 (and Galaxy S8 Plus), and they both walked away knowing it would be their next phone. One of those former Pixel owners got their phone in December, which means they've only had it four months before they were coaxed into picking up a new phone. He's not typically known for switching phones on a whim, so the Galaxy S8 really impressed him. The other got his in October, right when it became available, so six months is a bit more understandable, I think. As for me, if I still had my Google Pixel I'd have a tough decision in front of me. Like I've said in the past, the Galaxy S8's display is ridiculous, and it's a pretty strong, and convincing, reason for me to consider it as my next daily driver. However, I think the Pixel would win out for me, simply because the camera in it is stupendous, and I hate the fingerprint sensor location on the Galaxy S8. Still, I'd have to give it some serious thought. In any event, these two got me thinking: Are any of you Pixel or Pixel XL owners out there already working on picking up a Galaxy S8? And if so, what about Samsung's newest flagship smartphone convinced you to make the switch? How long have you had your Pixel? Let me know!

Some Pixel phones are having problems with backups, Google is looking into it Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/04/20 10:35am PDTApr 20, 2017 22 Plus 1 on G+ 14 Share on Facebook 42 Share on Twitter Total Shares78 Bug Watch Google News Pixel Pixel XL Some users have been experiencing issues with backup on Google's Pixel devices, most notably backups of SMS, call history, and apps, although other accounts of all backup types failing have also been reported.  The current cause isn't known, but reports of the problem on Google's product forums stretch back to just after the launch of the device, and for many the matter remains unresolved. Even one of Google's support specialists discovered he was experiencing the issue, but apart from reaching out to those affected for bug reports no information has been publicly provided. To be clear, for those with the problem their personal data in one or more categories may not be being backed up as they would expect. Not to be alarmist, but with this backup error occurring silently, it might be prudent for Pixel users to check that their devices are, in fact, performing their backups as expected and intended. To check for yourself, navigate to Settings, Backup and Reset, Backup and see if any of the items listed under Content are "Waiting to backup." If you are among those suffering the problem you might want to exercise some caution and consider another backup method for whatever might be failing for you. Also, feel free to add your voices (and log-files) down at Google's product forums. They're currently reaching out to those affected there for additional information, and with more data the issue can probably be fixed that much more quickly.

Gustavo Me too, also only seeing it in Call History on my Pixel teh Jax At least the important ones are working fine! Andrew same here Ryne Hager That's not a huge deal, then. Not the worst thing to lose if your phone eats it. Photos or SMS could be a bigger problem, though. teh Jax Right. If somebody is experiencing this bug with other pieces of data, this is a big deal! If this is all it is, hardly anybody is going to care. And those that do care probably should be using multiple forms of backup anyway. Sachin Bahal Same here Suicide_Note Same. That's the only one that had any issue on my device. steb0ne Same here... So most people in this comment section who actually have Pixel devices seem to be having the same issue with the call history not backing up and a bunch of trolling by other people talking about how it's plagued with bugs, lol! Got it! I wonder how long it's been acting up... Everything else shows backed up this morning. If this is a daily backup and it didn't backup one day is this really that big of a deal? The screenshot posted shows December... I'm curious to know is this a Google feature or Pixel feature? Can someone else with a phone running Nougat confirm if theirs is backing up? teh Jax Definitely a lot of trolling and ignorance going on in these comments. That's pretty typical by people commenting about a premium device that they either can't buy or chose not to buy - it helps them justify their situation. Which is fine by me. It's rare that comments are actually insightful. ¯_(ツ)_/¯ teddyfrozevelt Mine hasn't backed up since I factory reset it in december. Everything else has backed up. Impulse_Vigil It's an Android feature, has been forever, but O and the Pixel are the first places where it's status has been exposed and broken down by category. So it may or may not be working elsewhere, you wouldn't really know. Now freak out! Heh... steb0ne That's what I thought... So it's possibly happening on other non Pixel devices. The article made it seem Pixel specific CJ Me too. Maxr1998 Same for me, Nexus 6P, O Preview. Also had that issue for SMS & apps after I clean-flashed the update, but I could at least fix the latter by manually running "bmgr backupnow --all" in a su shell. SMS somehow resolved itself it seems. Impulse_Vigil Same, everything else is backed up, didn't even know call history could be backed up. 4Ui812 Better call Saul. Bat Man 1 day = 1 problem? 4Ui812 Nausea, heartburn, indigestion, upset stomach, diarrhea.... Google's quality control is hard at work. Middlefinger Yeah, but at least it gets 'Timely updates' /s Phalkon30 Just bought my 6p 2 weeks ago, not a single thing moved to it from my previous device. It's like I never had a Google history, even though I have app backups on my Google Drive. I even tried to to set up from another device, it gave an unknown error and moved nothing I'm going to have to root to fix it, awful backup solution sproc I think it only works with the same phone honestly, cause otherwise I bet no one uses it sadly. Tiuri Elvander Sent in my 6p for an RMA, it was fully backed up. Tried to restore the backup on my replacement 6p but it only offered my One plus One (which I used while I was waiting for my replacement). The whole thing lasted less than a week, yet my original backup was not available as an option to restore. Very annoying!! Jordan VanCampen Same here. My work phone which is a Moto z play stopped working. I got a replacement and thought that I'd be able restore it from the previous one, but nope. The setup process only gave me the option to restore from my Vizio tablet that came with my TV that I recently bought. My pixel that is my personal phone wasn't an option. So I decided that I would use the NFC option. So I I did that with my pixel and it didn't restore anything at all. The backup situation on Android is still pretty much a dumpster fire. Ryne Hager I've had the restore from previous device thing bug out as well, I usually just set everything up as a new device now. blindexecutioner $800 device running never-ending beta software. Jingwei Zhang It does backup a lot of settings for many apps. As for games, if the game requires logging in, it backs up the log in information if you had it set as memorized. It also memorizes the layout of the apps. The backup is definitely not the best, but it's automatic and much more comprehensive than the native backup other manufacturers provide, including ios. Roy Hm, no. I used an iphone and ipod touch ages ago and they actually have a backup solution that works. When you restore, it's like you never left - even between devices. Even Blackberry had a better backup system than Android ever has - the only decent backup solution Android has is Titanium backup (which is, to be fair, excellent), and that requires root so most people are SOL. I've never even had my wifi settings restored properly, even though that's supposedly backed up. Jingwei Zhang Hm, no. We have six iPhones in the family and none of them backup like you said here (like you never left). However, my Nexus to Pixel transfer was like that. All apps, photos, sms and etc were restored to the same position and most pertinent settings were restored. IIRC, the phone even restored my company's WIFI setting with the correct credential. I don't know which android phone you have, but Google's backup does some pretty amazing things for requiring absolutely no maintenance on the user's side. EDIT: I just remembered. My sister and mom actually use Google Photo on their iPhone 6S/7 because it's free and easy as opposed to the tiny iCloud storage. JohnyNoLegs Its free when it compresses your photos. Also iPhone does whole phone backup, android does not. Also if you lose your pixel right now, you are screwed, as you can't do a transfer. Jingwei Zhang IIRC Pixel has full photo backup without any compression. I believe I specifically said that it does some amazing things with absolutely no user side maintenance. You can always do a manual full backup with titanium or in recovery. Root and unlocked bootloader are needed, but that's just takes a few minutes with Nexus and Pixel. How is that? Everything is automatically backed up including video, pic and sms, call history and etc on a daily basis. I would wager that you can retrieve more current information from a lost Pixel/Nexus than from a lost iPhone if they were both lost and went completely off the grid. JohnyNoLegs Wager away, then send me the money. iPhone does a bit for bit backup, it backs up the current state of the whole iPhone. Google does not do this. Google selectively backs up items like call history, sms etc. Pixel is the only Android phone that offers uncompressed backup for free, not really an option for everyone mate. Titanium backup is for ROOT LOLOLOLOL. Recovery is for unlocked devices LOLOLOLOLOL iPhone does complete backup with any hacking required, talk about no user side maintenance! BTW, my Pixel stopped backup up photos, it's a bug. Doesn't sound like no user maintenance required haha Jingwei Zhang hmm comparing full backup that can take upwards of an hour to one that runs in the background huh? You definitely understand what no user maintenance is and are certainly brilliant. Comparing apple to orange as long as it suits your narrative. Are we talking about any other android phone? I don't think so. Unlocking bootloader and granting root access are considered hacking now? Bugs and failures happen, just like how two of our iPhone 6 bricked just out of warranty. Also, my Pixel is not experiencing this bug, so it's not a problem for me (yet). JohnyNoLegs Think logically for a second mate. You are talking a out no user maintenance. IPhone does full backups while you sleep. Android does not. To root your phone and unlock the bootloader requires user maintenance. Impulse_Vigil I do think iOS backup functionality is more comprehensive, it doesn't leave things up to individual devs either... OTOH it does gobble up a pretty decent amount of storage on accounts where people often end up having to pay extra for... Nothing is perfect. JohnyNoLegs It's true, but for the person who just wants their stuff backed up, IOS has it covered much better than android. Even the simplicity of setting up iCloud to do everything is great. In Android it is a bit all over the shop in deep settings and different apps. I'm fine with Androids implementation, but then again I don't care about doing factory resets etc which is kinda the nature of android. iPhone users perhaps are less used to having to restore their data all the time. Ryne Hager I think it backs up some appdata, like Netflix login information carrying over to new devices, that sort of thing. JohnyNoLegs After an RMA and a few factory resets, I can tell you it hasn't in my case. Impulse_Vigil It can do that, but apps need to be written for it, backup has always been a joke on Android but it's largely because devs ignore the existing tools tbh. Killa I'm not seeing any option on my Nexus 6 in the Backup & Reset area that shows the breakout of the different backup content like it does in the image above. There's just the On/Off switch and language that says backups are in Google Drive...etc. Is this only a Pixel thing or higher version of Android? Phalkon30 Must be a pixel thing, I don't see it on my 6P either, and I'm on 7.1.2 Cyan Thayn It's also an O thing apparently, have the exact menu shown in the screenshots on my 6P on the O preview (and have the same bugs as well!). Ryne Hager It's a pixel thing, no need to worry. Impulse_Vigil I'm not even sure what the point is, I guess extra info and transparency (which is good), because none of those options really do anything but tell you what's being backed up. There's nothing to toggle besides the main backup option and the option to backup to Drive. Shoot, other phones could be suffering the same issues but because the backup status isn't displayed nobody would know! On my Pixel everything but call history is up to date, and I couldn't care less about that. Ishimaru Another day, another Pixel issue. Ramon Google is fucking up a lot lately. What's taking so long to fire some people? Just not just lately Conrad Okay, so what happened to the review of the Synology 416play? I'd really like to read it! lomsha Some premium device lol. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Once again, I told you so. You should really run a daily series called "Google Screwup Of The Day". Ryne Hager Your name is amazing. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Not many people get it. ;) J.J. Pixel and problem are two words heard often lately! Leif Sikorski Same with previous Nexus and some other Google Hardware devices. It's one reason why I'm glad that other OEMs update slower these days. Google keeps giving me the impression that they still see their devices as geeky developer devices where the user does the final testing. If they want to be more serious with their hardware efforts and compete with the big brands they need to invest much more money into testing and customer support. Ryne Hager Eh, bugs happen with any tech, and the volume of problems has gotten a lot smaller than things used to be back in the day. Progress has its pitfalls, is all. Nick I'm with you here. I get that people expect nothing but excellence from a device that they paid a pretty penny for, but stuff happens sometimes and so far it hasn't been anything that warrants the level of indignation I am seeing here in the comment section. I'm sure Google will fix the issue as soon as they possibly can. JohnyNoLegs And by progress, you mean they haven't really done anything different right? Still the same updates with bugs, still take ages to fix anything. I am still having the worst bluetooth experience of any phone I have owned, and that's after an RMA already! Anon Now we know why the pixel includes 24/7 support. Lisarbeams Managing director of Google!, is explaining to users to start off "Work at home" method, that People have been doing for about one year now.

Let's see what the bug list for the S8 looks like six months down the line! Phil We're already on a pink screen and what's it been? 2 weeks? I've not heard any reports of exploding Pixels so far at least. Most of the people trolling these articles are Sammy Knights who should know better. I'm looking forward to seeing what problems the S8 has over the next 6 months. By the way, is Bixby's working yet? Mike Bastable The Pixel handsets seen to be agreeing poorly... Lot of bugs recently... Sachin Bahal no device will ever be perfect, there will always be some issue(s) during a device's life cycle, and it just so happens that the Pixel's issues/bugs are happening 6 months into the phone's life cycle Ryne Hager Yeah, I expect they'll probably get things fixed. Bugs happen. Sachin Bahal The Pixel is just crawling with bugs ;) Hussain Ahmadi And some go on to call this crap as best Android phone? A big joke and Google has made a really big joke of itself by releasing this iAndroid phone!! Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ The Pixel is STILL listed as the Best Android Phone on most sites, despite all the problems, the halos in the pictures, etc. Even though I NEVER thought it deserved that status, I can understand that most of its problems surfaced after web magazines rated it. But it's clear now that the phone sucks and its software sucks. If publishing had any integrity, they'd issue a correction, revoke that title and make some other phone the best phone of 2016. Impulse_Vigil Or most of the problems aren't really as wide spread as some seem to believe, I've had pretty much no issues with mine. Marty I had a Google backup issue on my OP3T. I factory wiped it after an update and the restore function usually seen during set up didn't appear. YaKillaCJ Something about that picture just bugs me... Impulse_Vigil I see what you did there! Have a ^ Arcest Not new adb restore failed to re-install apk https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/37130390 Sir_Brizz Compromise free device. Actually getting tired of making this joke, which says something. Impulse_Vigil Compromise and bug free since Nov here. /shrug New_Guy Geez, they Pixel has so many issues, it's crazy... Phil This problem is only being reported by people enrolled on the beta testing of Android O ffs. Of course there are going to be bugs with am OS still in the testing stage. That's the whole point isn't it? Give people an early look in order that they can identify bugs and instabilities? The problem is not the phone, it a Dev version of an OS. Kevin Sword Loving your hero images Ryne! Mr.Bean ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ We're gonna need a can of Raid to squash these bugs. Muzaffar Don't mind the bugs, as long as it get stock android and latest update. ashjas Are these options only pixel specific..? I mean I don't see such backup options on my Nexus 4 with nougut custom rom? Impulse_Vigil Call history is waiting to be backed up here weird, everything else is current. I didn't even know my phone backed up call history tbh... Seems I've gotten ultra lucky with Pixel bugs, outside a handful of sporadic instances of Bluetooth turning off thru the start of the year I've avoided just about everything else. Got mine in November FWIW, tap on wood. Bala Same here since day one for SMS and call history ,it's funny when they say they are looking into. A feature that's supposed to work with final release is not working for a while and still they are looking Jan Machovec Is this something Pixel specific? Because I don't see any option to backup SMS, Call log and others on my SGS7.

Multi-user voice recognition is rolling out to Google Home today Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/04/20 9:01am PDTApr 20, 2017 70 Plus 1 on G+ 125 Share on Facebook 89 Share on Twitter Total Shares284 Google News Videos Update 1: 2017/04/20 12:02pm PDT Here is the setup flow, courtesy of Artem Russakovskii: Bringing Google Assistant out of the phone and dropping it into Google Home comes with some difficulties. Not the least of which is, how do you handle personal account preferences and data when Google Home is available to everyone in the house? Until now the solution has been "don't." Starting today, you can register multiple users with your Google home, which recognizes them by voice. To set this up. look for a device card in the Home app that says"Multi-user is now available" or "Link your account." The setup process has you say the "OK Google" and "Hey Google" hotwords twice each. From then on, Google Home will be able to provide personal results because it knows who you are. The same is true for up to five other people in the house. The personal results affected by multi-user include My Day, calendars, flights, shopping lists, photos, and more. Each user of Google Home will also be asked to set some preferences for things like video and music services. If you set up a new user and don't do that, Google Home just defaults to the ones used by the first account. You can get started fiddling around with this today, but only in the US. Multi-user will roll out to the UK in the coming months.

Evolutionary at best. cusaitech Will this prevent ads from activating Google home? Jonathan Berry I believe unrecognized users will continue to work, just without the personalization it can do if it recognizes you. Shagnscooby I'm wondering if you can specify the default account if it's an unrecognized person. The biggest reason I've been looking forward to this is because of someone in my house using the Google Home for music with GPM and me in the car listening and it stops playing because of simultaneous streams. I'd probably specify one of my kids as the default account so it never overlaps my listening. Kakairo Yes! Can't wait to set this up when I get home.

Lisarbeams Managing director of Google!, is explaining to users to start off "Work at home" method, that People have been doing for about one year now.

M. Luciano Not without sharing your calendar to the other account. F4LL0U7 My IT department blocks sharing our work calendars externally. gSyncit is the only thing that worked for me, and it works great.

I have my calendar, google drive and play store apps all on my gapps acocunt, but gplay music and non-business stuff on my gmail. Shoudl i try to transfer everything over to my consumer gmail account and just share my biz calendar to personal? I ask this as features seem to be limited at times with gapps accounts and when i linked my gapps with Home (due to my calendar), it says it cannot access my agenda. David Hyman Will this allow me to use my Spotify account on my phone while my wife uses hers on our Google home? jonzey231 As long as she specifies her Spotify account under her profile, I wouldn't see why not. David Hyman If that's the case it would solve such a first world problem for us! Let's hope that's how it works jonzey231 My brother is adding my Fiancee and I to his GPM family plan right now so we can take advantage of this.

Morten Ulv My 6P is over two years old and I have both the battery and the bootloop issue. Luckily, in my Norway, phones (and most electronics) have by law a 5 year "extended warranty" (from the seller, not the manufacturer) to protect consumers from issues like this. NexusPhan You're posting on the wrong article. Also, no your 6P is not over two years old as it wasn't released two years ago. Morten Ulv Guess I fucked that up. I bought it used, and my reciept is from march 2015, so that's why. Maybe the preorder date or an error. benjammin03 What does it do with an unrecognized voice? Does it default to a primary account?

Some Pixel phones are having problems with backups, Google is looking into it Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/04/20 10:35am PDTApr 20, 2017 22 Plus 1 on G+ 14 Share on Facebook 42 Share on Twitter Total Shares78 Bug Watch Google News Pixel Pixel XL Some users have been experiencing issues with backup on Google's Pixel devices, most notably backups of SMS, call history, and apps, although other accounts of all backup types failing have also been reported.  The current cause isn't known, but reports of the problem on Google's product forums stretch back to just after the launch of the device, and for many the matter remains unresolved. Even one of Google's support specialists discovered he was experiencing the issue, but apart from reaching out to those affected for bug reports no information has been publicly provided. To be clear, for those with the problem their personal data in one or more categories may not be being backed up as they would expect. Not to be alarmist, but with this backup error occurring silently, it might be prudent for Pixel users to check that their devices are, in fact, performing their backups as expected and intended. To check for yourself, navigate to Settings, Backup and Reset, Backup and see if any of the items listed under Content are "Waiting to backup." If you are among those suffering the problem you might want to exercise some caution and consider another backup method for whatever might be failing for you. Also, feel free to add your voices (and log-files) down at Google's product forums. They're currently reaching out to those affected there for additional information, and with more data the issue can probably be fixed that much more quickly.

Gustavo Me too, also only seeing it in Call History on my Pixel teh Jax At least the important ones are working fine! Andrew same here Ryne Hager That's not a huge deal, then. Not the worst thing to lose if your phone eats it. Photos or SMS could be a bigger problem, though. teh Jax Right. If somebody is experiencing this bug with other pieces of data, this is a big deal! If this is all it is, hardly anybody is going to care. And those that do care probably should be using multiple forms of backup anyway. Sachin Bahal Same here Suicide_Note Same. That's the only one that had any issue on my device. steb0ne Same here... So most people in this comment section who actually have Pixel devices seem to be having the same issue with the call history not backing up and a bunch of trolling by other people talking about how it's plagued with bugs, lol! Got it! I wonder how long it's been acting up... Everything else shows backed up this morning. If this is a daily backup and it didn't backup one day is this really that big of a deal? The screenshot posted shows December... I'm curious to know is this a Google feature or Pixel feature? Can someone else with a phone running Nougat confirm if theirs is backing up? teh Jax Definitely a lot of trolling and ignorance going on in these comments. That's pretty typical by people commenting about a premium device that they either can't buy or chose not to buy - it helps them justify their situation. Which is fine by me. It's rare that comments are actually insightful. ¯_(ツ)_/¯ teddyfrozevelt Mine hasn't backed up since I factory reset it in december. Everything else has backed up. Impulse_Vigil It's an Android feature, has been forever, but O and the Pixel are the first places where it's status has been exposed and broken down by category. So it may or may not be working elsewhere, you wouldn't really know. Now freak out! Heh... steb0ne That's what I thought... So it's possibly happening on other non Pixel devices. The article made it seem Pixel specific CJ Me too. Maxr1998 Same for me, Nexus 6P, O Preview. Also had that issue for SMS & apps after I clean-flashed the update, but I could at least fix the latter by manually running "bmgr backupnow --all" in a su shell. SMS somehow resolved itself it seems. Impulse_Vigil Same, everything else is backed up, didn't even know call history could be backed up. 4Ui812 Better call Saul. Bat Man 1 day = 1 problem? 4Ui812 Nausea, heartburn, indigestion, upset stomach, diarrhea.... Google's quality control is hard at work. Middlefinger Yeah, but at least it gets 'Timely updates' /s Phalkon30 Just bought my 6p 2 weeks ago, not a single thing moved to it from my previous device. It's like I never had a Google history, even though I have app backups on my Google Drive. I even tried to to set up from another device, it gave an unknown error and moved nothing I'm going to have to root to fix it, awful backup solution sproc I think it only works with the same phone honestly, cause otherwise I bet no one uses it sadly. Tiuri Elvander Sent in my 6p for an RMA, it was fully backed up. Tried to restore the backup on my replacement 6p but it only offered my One plus One (which I used while I was waiting for my replacement). The whole thing lasted less than a week, yet my original backup was not available as an option to restore. Very annoying!! Jordan VanCampen Same here. My work phone which is a Moto z play stopped working. I got a replacement and thought that I'd be able restore it from the previous one, but nope. The setup process only gave me the option to restore from my Vizio tablet that came with my TV that I recently bought. My pixel that is my personal phone wasn't an option. So I decided that I would use the NFC option. So I I did that with my pixel and it didn't restore anything at all. The backup situation on Android is still pretty much a dumpster fire. Ryne Hager I've had the restore from previous device thing bug out as well, I usually just set everything up as a new device now. blindexecutioner $800 device running never-ending beta software. Jingwei Zhang It does backup a lot of settings for many apps. As for games, if the game requires logging in, it backs up the log in information if you had it set as memorized. It also memorizes the layout of the apps. The backup is definitely not the best, but it's automatic and much more comprehensive than the native backup other manufacturers provide, including ios. Roy Hm, no. I used an iphone and ipod touch ages ago and they actually have a backup solution that works. When you restore, it's like you never left - even between devices. Even Blackberry had a better backup system than Android ever has - the only decent backup solution Android has is Titanium backup (which is, to be fair, excellent), and that requires root so most people are SOL. I've never even had my wifi settings restored properly, even though that's supposedly backed up. Jingwei Zhang Hm, no. We have six iPhones in the family and none of them backup like you said here (like you never left). However, my Nexus to Pixel transfer was like that. All apps, photos, sms and etc were restored to the same position and most pertinent settings were restored. IIRC, the phone even restored my company's WIFI setting with the correct credential. I don't know which android phone you have, but Google's backup does some pretty amazing things for requiring absolutely no maintenance on the user's side. EDIT: I just remembered. My sister and mom actually use Google Photo on their iPhone 6S/7 because it's free and easy as opposed to the tiny iCloud storage. JohnyNoLegs Its free when it compresses your photos. Also iPhone does whole phone backup, android does not. Also if you lose your pixel right now, you are screwed, as you can't do a transfer. Jingwei Zhang IIRC Pixel has full photo backup without any compression. I believe I specifically said that it does some amazing things with absolutely no user side maintenance. You can always do a manual full backup with titanium or in recovery. Root and unlocked bootloader are needed, but that's just takes a few minutes with Nexus and Pixel. How is that? Everything is automatically backed up including video, pic and sms, call history and etc on a daily basis. I would wager that you can retrieve more current information from a lost Pixel/Nexus than from a lost iPhone if they were both lost and went completely off the grid. JohnyNoLegs Wager away, then send me the money. iPhone does a bit for bit backup, it backs up the current state of the whole iPhone. Google does not do this. Google selectively backs up items like call history, sms etc. Pixel is the only Android phone that offers uncompressed backup for free, not really an option for everyone mate. Titanium backup is for ROOT LOLOLOLOL. Recovery is for unlocked devices LOLOLOLOLOL iPhone does complete backup with any hacking required, talk about no user side maintenance! BTW, my Pixel stopped backup up photos, it's a bug. Doesn't sound like no user maintenance required haha Jingwei Zhang hmm comparing full backup that can take upwards of an hour to one that runs in the background huh? You definitely understand what no user maintenance is and are certainly brilliant. Comparing apple to orange as long as it suits your narrative. Are we talking about any other android phone? I don't think so. Unlocking bootloader and granting root access are considered hacking now? Bugs and failures happen, just like how two of our iPhone 6 bricked just out of warranty. Also, my Pixel is not experiencing this bug, so it's not a problem for me (yet). JohnyNoLegs Think logically for a second mate. You are talking a out no user maintenance. IPhone does full backups while you sleep. Android does not. To root your phone and unlock the bootloader requires user maintenance. Impulse_Vigil I do think iOS backup functionality is more comprehensive, it doesn't leave things up to individual devs either... OTOH it does gobble up a pretty decent amount of storage on accounts where people often end up having to pay extra for... Nothing is perfect. JohnyNoLegs It's true, but for the person who just wants their stuff backed up, IOS has it covered much better than android. Even the simplicity of setting up iCloud to do everything is great. In Android it is a bit all over the shop in deep settings and different apps. I'm fine with Androids implementation, but then again I don't care about doing factory resets etc which is kinda the nature of android. iPhone users perhaps are less used to having to restore their data all the time. Ryne Hager I think it backs up some appdata, like Netflix login information carrying over to new devices, that sort of thing. JohnyNoLegs After an RMA and a few factory resets, I can tell you it hasn't in my case. Impulse_Vigil It can do that, but apps need to be written for it, backup has always been a joke on Android but it's largely because devs ignore the existing tools tbh. Killa I'm not seeing any option on my Nexus 6 in the Backup & Reset area that shows the breakout of the different backup content like it does in the image above. There's just the On/Off switch and language that says backups are in Google Drive...etc. Is this only a Pixel thing or higher version of Android? Phalkon30 Must be a pixel thing, I don't see it on my 6P either, and I'm on 7.1.2 Cyan Thayn It's also an O thing apparently, have the exact menu shown in the screenshots on my 6P on the O preview (and have the same bugs as well!). Ryne Hager It's a pixel thing, no need to worry. Impulse_Vigil I'm not even sure what the point is, I guess extra info and transparency (which is good), because none of those options really do anything but tell you what's being backed up. There's nothing to toggle besides the main backup option and the option to backup to Drive. Shoot, other phones could be suffering the same issues but because the backup status isn't displayed nobody would know! On my Pixel everything but call history is up to date, and I couldn't care less about that. Ishimaru Another day, another Pixel issue. Ramon Google is fucking up a lot lately. What's taking so long to fire some people? Just not just lately Conrad Okay, so what happened to the review of the Synology 416play? I'd really like to read it! lomsha Some premium device lol. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Once again, I told you so. You should really run a daily series called "Google Screwup Of The Day". Ryne Hager Your name is amazing. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Not many people get it. ;) J.J. Pixel and problem are two words heard often lately! Leif Sikorski Same with previous Nexus and some other Google Hardware devices. It's one reason why I'm glad that other OEMs update slower these days. Google keeps giving me the impression that they still see their devices as geeky developer devices where the user does the final testing. If they want to be more serious with their hardware efforts and compete with the big brands they need to invest much more money into testing and customer support. Ryne Hager Eh, bugs happen with any tech, and the volume of problems has gotten a lot smaller than things used to be back in the day. Progress has its pitfalls, is all. Nick I'm with you here. I get that people expect nothing but excellence from a device that they paid a pretty penny for, but stuff happens sometimes and so far it hasn't been anything that warrants the level of indignation I am seeing here in the comment section. I'm sure Google will fix the issue as soon as they possibly can. JohnyNoLegs And by progress, you mean they haven't really done anything different right? Still the same updates with bugs, still take ages to fix anything. I am still having the worst bluetooth experience of any phone I have owned, and that's after an RMA already! Anon Now we know why the pixel includes 24/7 support. Lisarbeams Managing director of Google!, is explaining to users to start off "Work at home" method, that People have been doing for about one year now.

Sachin Bahal no device will ever be perfect, there will always be some issue(s) during a device's life cycle, and it just so happens that the Pixel's issues/bugs are happening 6 months into the phone's life cycle Ryne Hager Yeah, I expect they'll probably get things fixed. Bugs happen. Sachin Bahal The Pixel is just crawling with bugs ;) Hussain Ahmadi And some go on to call this crap as best Android phone? A big joke and Google has made a really big joke of itself by releasing this iAndroid phone!! Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ The Pixel is STILL listed as the Best Android Phone on most sites, despite all the problems, the halos in the pictures, etc. Even though I NEVER thought it deserved that status, I can understand that most of its problems surfaced after web magazines rated it. But it's clear now that the phone sucks and its software sucks. If publishing had any integrity, they'd issue a correction, revoke that title and make some other phone the best phone of 2016. Impulse_Vigil Or most of the problems aren't really as wide spread as some seem to believe, I've had pretty much no issues with mine. Marty I had a Google backup issue on my OP3T. I factory wiped it after an update and the restore function usually seen during set up didn't appear. YaKillaCJ Something about that picture just bugs me... Impulse_Vigil I see what you did there! Have a ^ Arcest Not new adb restore failed to re-install apk https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/37130390 Sir_Brizz Compromise free device. Actually getting tired of making this joke, which says something. Impulse_Vigil Compromise and bug free since Nov here. /shrug New_Guy Geez, they Pixel has so many issues, it's crazy... Phil This problem is only being reported by people enrolled on the beta testing of Android O ffs. Of course there are going to be bugs with am OS still in the testing stage. That's the whole point isn't it? Give people an early look in order that they can identify bugs and instabilities? The problem is not the phone, it a Dev version of an OS. Kevin Sword Loving your hero images Ryne! Mr.Bean ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ We're gonna need a can of Raid to squash these bugs. Muzaffar Don't mind the bugs, as long as it get stock android and latest update. ashjas Are these options only pixel specific..? I mean I don't see such backup options on my Nexus 4 with nougut custom rom? Impulse_Vigil Call history is waiting to be backed up here weird, everything else is current. I didn't even know my phone backed up call history tbh... Seems I've gotten ultra lucky with Pixel bugs, outside a handful of sporadic instances of Bluetooth turning off thru the start of the year I've avoided just about everything else. Got mine in November FWIW, tap on wood. Bala Same here since day one for SMS and call history ,it's funny when they say they are looking into. A feature that's supposed to work with final release is not working for a while and still they are looking Jan Machovec Is this something Pixel specific? Because I don't see any option to backup SMS, Call log and others on my SGS7.

WSJ: Google planning to block bad ads in Chrome on desktop and mobile Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/04/19 6:31pm PDTApr 19, 2017 67 Plus 1 on G+ 132 Share on Facebook 74 Share on Twitter Total Shares273 Google News Rumors Advertising is very much a balancing act for websites these days. You want to make enough money from an ad-supported site to cover costs, but you don't want to annoy users to the point they block all your ads. Some websites don't seem to care how much they annoy you, though. Google is reportedly getting ready to take a stand against the worst ads on the web with a built in ad-blocker for Chrome. According to the Wall Street Journal, Google's ad-blocking feature could be turned on by default in the desktop and mobile versions of Chrome. It would filter out only the ads Google deems unacceptable. That would cover things like pop-ups, auto-playing video ads, and “prestitial” ads with countdown timers. Google may even build the feature such that it blocks all the ads on a site that serves one of these unacceptable ads. That would nudge website operators to get all their ads in order—after all, Chrome is a huge chunk of usage. Google has not commented on the Wall Street Journal's story, probably because it's still trying to figure out how to pitch the ad blocker (if it's real). This could be seen as an attempt to coerce website operators to only run Google's AdSense ads, which are guaranteed not to run afoul of Google's blocking policies. It's a risky direction for an advertising powerhouse like Google to go, but it might not see a better way to deal with the prevalence of ad-blocking.

AbbyZFresh What did WSJ do to you? Nathan J What did they do for you? The Wall Street Journal is owned by Rupert Murdoch's News Corp, which runs the propaganda arm of the Republican party in the US, better known as Fox News. Murdoch's interference in politics and opposition to freedom isn't limited to the US. I don't recall the details, but the EU or UK was about to kick him out for starting trouble over there a year or two ago. I'm not real big on politics, but I think a certain distrust of News Corp, to a point, is healthy and should not really be questioned. Cakefish You might be referring to News of The World - a British tabloid newspaper run by Rupert Murdoch that was closed down a few years ago because it was found to have spied on people's phones. This included hacking the phone of a murdered teenager and soldiers who had died in combat. It caused a massive uproar. ZettabyteGamer Spread a lot of false information about YouTubers, and YouTube as a platform. They focus on clicks, and getting subscribers instead of accurate information reporting. givitumibeybi WSJ is a wannabe BuzzFeed newspaper. Trooper311 Awesome. Josh Crumley Good. Those ones where you load a page and start reading then suddenly disappears and a fullscreen ad with a 5 "second" timer starts going that takes about 5 seconds *per* second...ugh (looking at you gawker media). I just hope they don't automatically assume all google ad placements are ok just because they're google ads. DozensOfUs If you read gawker sites, it means you're a liberal weenie and deserve to be annoyed. Josh Crumley It was a kotaku article about zelda breath of the wild... 😆😄 https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/d88dd0554cbbcfbefae945805e94ca40e0596a9a2abfb8beb5f9b9b849ce1225.gif Martin The one that are making Sound and are pretty much impossible to close need to be first!!! (You won an iPhone - beeeeeeeeeeeeeep beeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeep beeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeep)... :) DragoCubed The vibrations! MJ Cool I guess but I recommend everyone just get a real ad blocker like uBlock Origin and be done with it. RyRyTheFunBun I begrudgingly use Dolphin on all my Android devices for the ad blocker. Their are better, but dolphin renders almost all sites correctly and is fast. freshprince_87 Chrome is better D.Smithee Are you kidding me? You're using that shitty adblocker add-on for Dolphin? That extension hasn't been updated in years. Just use Brave Browser for Android--it's essentially Chrome with adblocking, tracker blocking, HTTPS and fingerprinting protection with a few added necessities. Nathan J On mobile, just run a system-wide ad blocker. AdGuard on Android and AdBlock on iOS. Chrome works just fine with no ads seen anywhere. MJ Nothing wrong with Adguard but installing a whole app seems overkill when an browser add-on will do. I really have no interest in using Chrome on mobile. ZettabyteGamer What mobile browser do you use, our of curiosity? My1 well because if you do things like adaway and whatnot all the apps' ads will be kicked right into oblivion and not just the browser's ones. also when you have root, you can let the adblocker just play with the hosts file and let the networking layer do its thing. MJ I just need an ad blocker for the browser. I normally don't install programs that don't let you pay to remove ads. Root is a go since I use Android Pay. Finding it weird I have now had a half dozen replies giving me suggestions and "solutions" yet I didn't express having any problem... My1 well I dunno how secure android pay is but unless there is a chip similar to a smartcard or apple's secure enclave in the phone which stores all the needed data, it can be copied, effectively killing everything. I like my banking card with chip which is pretty much exactly a smart card meaning you cant read out any data without essentially destroying the card itself, and if made properly, the data will destroy itself when tampering happens. MJ I don't know where you live but in the US the smart chip on cards as been a disaster. This is the procedure to do a transaction... 1. Look at machine and wonder if the smart card reader is active? Is there a sign? Will the clerk tell me? No? Ask or guess... 2. The smartcard reader is active so now have to choose 1-3 options with buttons than wait 5-10 seconds for the transaction to be done. 3. Be startled by the annoying sound many terminals make like there was a error but it just means remove your card. Security? The magnetic stripe is still there! The procedure for a wireless transaction... 1. Look for the wireless/Android Pay symbol. Hold phone up to terminal and a second later transaction is done. Security? I know it uses end-to-end encryption for transactions. What will copy what and how? Carsten AdGuard is not for your browser, but for your whole system. So, "Free with ads" becomes basically free, for example ;) Nathan J Or "free with a white space taken out from where the ad was." Some ad blockers on the computer (or most now, maybe) can also remove the space, but we're not there yet on phones. Of course, you shouldn't use an ad blocker to rip off app developers. Buy the ad-free version. The only one I'm not doing that for is the weather apps. Most of them won't let you just buy an ad free version. They'll let you take the ads off for a year, but then they come back and/or they charge you again. Pretty greedy! Of course, there are pay-once weather apps, but the popular ones (Weather Channel, Weather Underground) only have the subscription. (I really need to just suck it up and get Dark Sky...) Carsten Well, we are - in most apps I don't get empty spaces. In Chrome definitely not, AdGuard uses some stuff (I don't know how) to remove the spaces entirely. Also: you can get lifetime licenses ;) For details, see this. They have written about such things just a few days ago: https://blog.adguard.com/en/adguard-vs-adaway-dns66/ Cakefish BBC Weather app. Free with no ads. Nathan J Android only? UK only perhaps? BBC is great but often they limit things to people who pay their fees — which is completely understandable. But when the Boston Marathon bombing happened, I went straight to the Beeb for coverage, online, in the US, and it was pretty great. Live video coverage, live tweets from their people (I guess), and a summary of what went down. They're the best. Cakefish Android and iOS. I checked on the website and apparently it's only available to download in the UK. That's a shame as it's a great app but understandable. Nathan J That's a pretty arbitrary limitation, and why I got a 128GB phone. Probably more than I need, but I've used more than a 64GB phone will hold. I don't know about Adguard on Android, but AdBlock on iPhone uses 16.9MB of space. That's with its filters. The app and its data and cache. And apps are usually bigger on iOS because, unlike Android, they can't share libraries, they're totally sandboxed. My biggest space hog is Spotify at 35.4GB. But again, why I got a 128GB phone. Second biggest is a game taking up about a tenth of that. Followed by VLC, which contains all videos stored on this phone (I don't use iTunes). Get a bigger phone, man. You'll thank yourself for it many times. Or go on arbitrarily limiting yourself. But don't think it's anything but that. MJ What? I don't need a bigger phone? I mentioned nothing about storage? Limiting myself? What are talking about? LOL How about you stop trolling? Nathan J This word, trolling. It doesn't mean what you think it means. If anything, you were trolling and I tried to respond rationally. Grow up. MJ You wrote a 100 some word essay about how I needed a "bigger" phone that was not relevant to anything. BLOCKED Nathan J Run on home to your safe space, bully. Ladies and gentlemen, this is why you stand up to bullies. They usually fold. Occasionally, in epic fashion. Especially online when they find out they don't have quite the presence they do on the playground. Jorge I guess no ad blocker will work on Android if you still use Chrome. Chrome serves the content right to you instead of your phone fetching the content from the source website. You need to use a different browser to block ads. Nathan J You guess incorrectly. What you're experiencing is Google proxying around your ad blocker. You have Chrome's data saver turned on. Bypassing your ad blocker is an unintended side effect. Turn off the data saver feature and the ad blocker will in fact block ads in Chrome. Chrome is not magically evading your ad blocker. You're just using Google's proxy instead of the one your ad blocker establishes. And that's really all there is to it. However, the Google App on iOS (Google Search + Now) will always proxy around an ad blocker. I don't know if it's a data saver that just can't be disabled (which would explain it) or malice on Google's part. I'm leaning toward the latter. But the fact remains, if I Google gaming stuff and go to a Wikia site, I get slammed with ads. If I Bing it, the ads don't show up. And Bing makes a great app. Shame fandroids slam it Because It's Not Google. Real shame. They're missing out. Jorge Adguard tells you what browsers work with adblockers on install. They only accept Yandex and Samsung Internet. There's no option to make it work with Chrome and I'm forced to install one of those if I want to continue with the installation. Anyways, I'll give it a try disabling data saver but it hasn't worked in the past with other ad blockers. Carsten AdGuard DOES work with Chrome, but not the browser-plugin adguard, you have to use the full app adguard. It even works with data saver, what confuses me, but it does. Necdet Ali Özdür Try Samsung Browser on mobile, it supports ad blocking. MJ I already have an ad blocker and no interest in the Samsung browser. LOL Hrishikesh Bisen Why? bekifft I've been impressed with Brave, it's basically uBlock plus https everywhere. Or Adguard if you must use Chrome. It's worth it. I wouldn't mind ads if they didn't try to hijack my phone and install malware. senor_heisenberg Noice, about time. Tom Erlandsen Google working on an ad-blocker? Now there's something I never expected to read haha JD Gotta finish off the competition somehow. They weren't going to do it by releasing polished products Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ LOL, unfortunately, true. My1 google releases polish products? do they also have a subcompany on Poland? SCNR. demarcmj He said "They weren't going to do it by releasing polished products" Bombaglad have you ever heard of editing comments? Jorge Yes, only Adsense will pass the "fair ad policy" and will be correctly displayed. All the other "your phone is full of viruses" won't be displayed. I will miss the sexy vibrations in my hand. :-( JG Does ChromeOS fall into the desktop category? or is this going to be browser only? kenspiracy ChromeOS would fall into the desktop category, yes. 4Ui812 Adgaurd for the win and the block. Untung Dwi Prasetyo Yes D.Smithee They make a great content blocker for Samsung browser--and let's face it, their Adguard VPN blocker for unrooted Android is a godsend. Cakefish I have a choice to use either the preinstalled Chrome browser or the preinstalled Samsung Internet browser on my phone. Samsung Internet supports adguard content blocker. Chrome does not. The choice is clear. In fact, it's hard to call it a choice. There is only one viable option to take. D.Smithee Did you not see my mention of the Adguard VPN that blocks ads in all browsers? So, yeah--you can use Chrome. Carsten I never thought I would pay for an ad blocker, but AdGuard ist sooooooo ♥ ♥ ♥ ! Also, right into the face of haters: "There is no get-everything-free-world today!" - "Dude, I'm actaully PAYING for not seeing ads!" :D Madis Surely you're paying, but who the money goes to is what matters... Carsten Yep, it is. You see, the argument against adblockers is: "There must be ads, otherwise everything would cost money and don't tell me you would pay for stuff online! Aha! So don't be an a-hole and disable your adblocker." But: I am paying! That's the point: Not just being a guy who wants everything for free, but saying "yes, I am okay with paying for good content." Problem is, websites with ads are no good content, while an adblocker is. Johny M This is not good. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/a6fddce77432d41dfcd3c6f79fcc7fa1244c36a5ce08a0227a141e8521e57f3e.gif So the biggest online add company will punish websites that post "bad" commercials. What can go wrong with that? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Exactly. Google ad services monopoly, here we come. Necdet Ali Özdür It's been done before. I mean blocking "bad" commercials. Almost all browsers now have an option to block pop up pages. I consider this an extension of it. rockstarr27 Google will use it to block non google approved ads, furthering their monopoly. Predictable. 4Ui812 Bingo MaroonMushroom All of the bigger advertising companies would probably meet Google's standards without issue. I'm sure the bar will be set low enough to mostly target the full screen ads that say your Android phone has 6 memory viruses while it's vibrating at you. rockstarr27 "Google will only block the bad ads, they wouldn't ever try to make their ad blocking more dominant compared to competitors with this move." - Ah to be young and naive. saf1927 Ah yes, because they want another antitrust case on them. As if Android weren't enough of a headache. Yep, really nice to be naive. LAMMJR O plz god yes, block those stupid ads that block chrome in android, spamming pop ups and using vibration saying my phone will be destroyed in x seconds if I don't install whaterver app they tell me to. Carson Saldanha Omg fr. I can't believe this is still a thing. Max I only can wish suffering to whoever developed those nasty ads. Nicoleckeys Google is paying 97$ per hour! Work for few hours & have longer with friends and family! !su184c: On tuesday I got a great new Land Rover Range Rover from having earned $8752 this last four weeks.. Its the most-financialy rewarding I've had.. It sounds unbelievable but you wont forgive yourself if you don’t check it !su184c: ➽➽ ➽➽;➽➽ http://GoogleFinancialCashJobs474MarketCubeGetPaid$97/Hour... ★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫::::::!su184c:....,...... Mr.Bean ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I would think they put those ads for curious eyes. LOL Stop playing with yourself and these ads will disappear! Defenestratus Sadly it's not just porn sites that have those these days. LAMMJR This is not exclusive to porn sites, porn sites are probably worse. Any site that offers ad-suported download can end up having one of those annoying ads. For example, sites that uses ad.fly as url shortening can end up stuffing this type of ads on your face. Modest Mind I'm not sure Google will integrate an adblocker to Chrome because Google and Ads are synonymous. Unless Google integrates an add-blocker that has a "white list" and Google Ads are at the top of that list. demarcmj They're just blocking "bad" ads Randroid Read the article. It's going to be the opposite. It's going to be a blacklist of ads that are dangerous, annoying, or intrusive Modest Mind Annoying, intrusive? That is the definition of Google ad business... justmy2pennies2012 The ones the block what you are reading and stays oin the screen as you scroll down are the worst. alexb88 Use Adguard! YaKillaCJ Oh that sounds horrible. I didn't kno ads got that bad. Been using AdAway for years now. Latheryin Ads will never be accepted by everyone. A lot of people see no use for them at all and will continue to block all ads. If they wanted commercials they can watch cable. Max Be careful with what you wish, the day ads die is the day everything will be paid on internet. TechGuy22 Like pirate don't exist lol tookieboy stupid people do though. happy pirating your gmail account Latheryin Yeah that will never happen. Even if it cuts people's use of the Internet by 65% that would not be a bad thing. And like TechGuy22 said. It will be broken. DragoCubed I can see a future with less outright box ads and ads that are hard to even tell that they are ads. Sponsored content and stuff. TechGuy22 Block these ads or the hijacked one on here specially https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/1abd2d9979769332aaaefa91b671e6683737b8fb001f1b9b41820b6a94d1eee9.png Josh Crumley But look at this one weird trick I learned! https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/c8c0b953c6e85700fbc7f7073a9f5ec68cb6a87dbf0c0afbca12b88428163ea5.png ilovetesla seriously , try it , its very good and a healthy tip for the phone internet never lies Jorge That only works on iOS. Android phones still don't support that at least on Nougat.

Totally worth it ilovetesla #FANTAPOWER Chris ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) How fantastic. Bruce Wayne Those ads are annoying. They are usually served up by a company called Outbrain. Jorge They're not that annoying. No other ads make your phone vibrate that sexy. Bruce Wayne Jorge, I'm going to need you to take your phone out of your pants. Jorge Why? I like the vibes inside my pants. They put me in the mood. Cakefish And Taboola and Revcontent jonzey231 "You'll never guess what she looks like now!!" Brian Kittelson I have add blocked these. Some of these are borderline NSFW. I don't need T&A ads while browsing a tech news website at work thank you. DragoCubed Awesome sauce LOL So no more pussiеs and тiтs on the side bar? Damn.... Michael Hazell Never thought I'd see the day that Google would assume the role as an ad blocker, but honestly I appreciate them filtering those ads on mobile devices where it's like "your device has 6 million viruses, install to fix." Those are just cancer and needed to be blocked anyways. I've been such a heavy ad blocker that I forgot what it's like to deal with cancerous ads on the internet. xmascarroll For some reason, my stock V20 always gets "Android Alert! Your device, GENERIC ANDROID DEVICE, has xxx viruses! Run Android GENERIC ANDROID DEVICE Cleaner now!" D.Smithee We'll assume you didn't run said cleaner. ilovetesla then, follow the instructions, its a generic cleaner Jorge What are you waiting for? Go do that right now. Your phone and your bank account will appreciate that. YuCMi Yes please! If this works the way it is described here, I'll turn off my indiscriminate adblocker. Dmitry Stepanushkin ADBlock. Problem solved 😂 Lord Argyris Somehow I'm categorizing this one in the "I'll believe it when I see it" category. It sounds an awful lot like an Outbrain story, which, incidentally enough, is one of the reasons people run ad blockers. That all said, these are the kinds of things I want to see blocked: -Anything that autoplays, makes noise, etc. -Anything that blinks, pops up, obscures the screen, or otherwise tries to distract me -Clickbait repos -Any and all forms of tracking--leave ad content selection up to the host site, or just push random ads The first two might be reasonably expected from a hypothetical Google ad blocker, but the third is questionable (the stories don't usually run afoul of the other criteria on the list; they're just trashy and take up page space and bandwidth). For the last one, however, I can barely hear myself typing over the laughter of the big ad companies (Google included). Tracking makes ads much more effective, and I don't see anything (apart from federal regulation, which has its own problems, not to mention scope limitations) that will ever manage to shove that genie back into the bottle. I'll play along with the rumor for a moment. What Google is likely doing here is protecting not just its ad revenue, but its ability to build up tracking data, which is immensely valuable. Trackers can be blocked by sufficiently motivated individuals, and third party extensions make this a lot easier. This is where Google wants to move in. By offering a basic solution to casual ad blockers, who just don't want to deal with the annoyance and page slowdown of heavily ad-infested sites, Google is ensuring that those tracking cookies are still set and that it (Google) and other third party ad companies can keep harvesting that data, even if people aren't seeing as many annoying ads. As an end user, this benefits me in some ways and hurts me in others. On the one hand, I feel like the presence of a Chrome-native, on-by-default blocker will bring about at least some progress on eradicating the Internet of the worst ad offenders, particularly if the penalty for non-compliance is that your site gets no revenue whatsoever from Chrome users who stick with the defaults. On the other hand, this will put the squeeze on more capable third party extensions that offer more granular control (as well as the ability to block more than just the ads themselves), which might drive some of them out of the market. Also, it abstracts the issue of tracking away from ad blocking--everybody can see the ads (and be creeped out at how relevant they are), but fewer people know about the tracking behind the scenes. If Google just makes some of the most annoying ads go away, many people will be satisfied, even if the tracking is still taking place. It also seems dangerously close to the sort of anticompetitive behavior commonly associated with late 90s-era Microsoft, since it's clear Google isn't being altruistic here. It's going to benefit from this initiative, and disproportionately to the other players in the market (both ad blockers and other ad companies). Notice what's not ever going to be blocked: Google-sourced ads. Everything else is theoretically fair game. Companies looking to advertise, as well as sites looking for ad revenue, will both be more confident in going with the Google ad platform than with competitors because they know that their ads will be compliant and that they won't risk losing revenue due to Google's ad blocker. We'll see how this shakes out. If a Chrome ad blocker is indeed under consideration, I suspect this information was purposely leaked to see what sort of reaction it gets. ast00 Block ads? Yes, please. Only accept AdSense? Oh hell no! (please link the gif) bozzykid The report says it will use the same "Acceptable Ads" that Adblock Plus supports so it wouldn't be accepting just Adsense. tookieboy don't bother.. people don't read ast00 I know what it says, but Google is no stranger to uncompetitive tactics. bozzykid I'm not sure you can read. The report makes it clear. Cory Wilson I want to be rid of the stupid ads that take over the whole screen and say "congratulations we're giving away giftcards to users who live in , you have 5 minutes to redeem". you can't get out of them unless you close the window and reopen. Anonymous and what about adsense? My1 well I think google isnt stupid enough to make adsense that bad so it would fall under the blocking guidelines, I mean adsense ads I saw were iirc usually just banners on the top, bottom or side. cr08 Yeah. Adsense has always been really lean and unobstrusive with their ads. I'd be happy with allowing adsense ads and also ads from other networks that are also unobtrusive. Hopefully with Google's knack for self learning algorithims they can nail this down. D.Smithee It's good news--but a little too late, Google. I've been using a content blocker since the very early 2000's with Firefox. Now I use uBlock Origin with Chrome desktop. I came to the conclusion a LONG time ago that sites don't have our best interests at heart. Even the ones that proclaim they do. For me, ads/trackers/etc. became a security issue quite some time ago--I just can't trust sites, so I just block ALL ads/trackers/undesirable content. And if a site objects to it or blocks users using content blockers, I just get my information elsewhere. It's that simple. Branko So awesome. Will it eventually filter "hate speech" and "fake news" too Google? If you want to place in a mechanism for ad blocking, users must have control over it. Otherwise it's prone to abuse of self interests. Go fuck yourselves Google. Disphouf Thats funny, I changed Chrome with Brave browser because their adblocker givitumibeybi lol. I can't understand why everyone is so excited. This will just be an Embrace, Extend, and Extinguish move. Kwetsima Maluleke Wow Google. Not bad. Its not like Samsung and Apple haven't had ad blockers for years now. givitumibeybi What's the difference between morals of using torrents to install overpriced things for free, and using adblockers to get access to the content of a website with disturbing advertisements for free? Cakefish - Taboola - Outbrain - Revcontent ^ THIS SCOURGE OF THE INTERNET MUST BE DESTROYED!!! I will not retire the use of my adblocker until those companies are wiped off the face of the planet. Truly, they are evil incarnate. They must die in a pit of flaming fury. Morten Ulv I wonder what happens on pages that block people from reading if they have an ad blocker. My mother would surely not know what to do. Markus Birth The fun thing is: Once EVERY Chrome user gets blocked from viewing those pages, they will very soon die or turn off their adblock-blocker. Better for everyone. Zach Mauch Hopefully it will also fight against adds using excessive processing. That is the major reason I still run it on sites as prominent as Android Central. They can just destroy performance. jonzey231 I could see this turning an anti-competition suit very quickly. It wouldn't be intentional but it would end up being Google blocking their own competitor's ads while allowing their own to flourish. It'll be seen the same as Android using only Google as the default search provider...and that definitely hasn't gone well for them abroad. Mark Curtis ALL ads are bad, I'm entitled to free content, gimme gimme gimme Chris Sanner I'll be honest - if they do this, I'd probably disable my other ad blocker entirely. I don't mind ALL ads, it's the ones that are COMPLETELY obnoxious that cause me to block the rest. currently most hated? the ones that show up as you scroll through a story and you have to scroll through them to get back to scrolling the site. John Petersen No way. This is just asking for abuse and conflicts of interest. Just enable add-ons for mobile, and let unvested third parties take care of the ad-blocking. PVL_93_RU I'm waiting to see how advertisement companies find a way around this built-in blocking LOL I am using adblocker via router so all devices connected are blocked BC This would be a lovely thing because I only disdain the annoying adverts that pop up and block my screen...Banners aren't bad as I can see those without having content obscured, also Google needs to get better at blocking the ads that cause redirects. Those really piss me off. PIucky Duck 🇩🇪 Rooted phone with AdAway is the way to go F4LL0U7 FYI, Adguard for Android is awesome. No root required. They have a desktop Chrome extension too, if you like having your ad blockers match across all devices. Michael Payton Endgame will be to block all ads not sold thru Google. That's how they make most of they're money, and other people will have to advertise thru them to get their ads seen. Vivek Rameses Don't be fooled, all ads are bad. YaKillaCJ Or here's a better idea, allow extensions in mobile. Maybe keep it in the beta to keep away the average person or at least express its a little advance. Brandon Good! Google is the ONLY ad network I trust to not contain malware. Until these websites properly audit their ad content and ensure it's not laden with malware then I will continue running an ad-blocker and a DNS blackhole. Anyone with a Pi checkout PiHole. bekifft If only Google offered some sort of service that would let you pay them money to block the ads...you'd still contribute to the sites, but only the ones that serve Google ads. They could call it something like... Google Contributor maybe? Just a crazy idea... I know I'd use it...

With a huge range of devices on multiple platforms used by over 61,000 employees, it’s no small feat. Google’s Technical Infrastructure organization is tasked with protecting employees against sophisticated adversaries, while ensuring that corporate security practices do not interfere with Google’s culture of innovation, freedom and flexibility. It accomplishes this with a tiered access security model that categorizes corporate services and devices into trust tiers to determine access.   Today, we are sharing details about our tiered access approach so that IT admins can use it to deploy devices in their organizations. In contrast to traditional security models, tiered access looks at a wide range of variables to make granular decisions regarding access. These variables go beyond simple user authentications—for example, device state, group permissions and required level of trust for a particular employee role are all taken into account. First, internal services are associated with a trust tier according to the sensitivity of the data. A service can have one minimum trust tier or a more granular model of access where components and/or capabilities (e.g. read or write access) have different minimum trust tiers based on risk. Second, as resource requests are made from devices, user credentials are verified and the state of the device is queried to assess its risk profile. On successful user verification, access to services is granted only if the assessed risk profile of the device matches the required trust tier. When implementing tiered access, there are three main components to consider: Client base and data sources: what is the composition of your organization’s fleet of devices and what data do you have about them? Access intelligence and gateways: what technology can you use to evaluate a set of policies and make access decisions? How close to when some attempts to access information can these decisions be made? Services to be accessed: what services need access controls and how will you classify the sensitivity of those services? For Google, tiered access is a powerful tool that goes hand in hand with a larger project called BeyondCorp, which challenges the traditional security assumptions that private or “internal” IP addresses represented a “more trusted” device than those coming from the internet, and is now available as a GCP service called Identity-Aware Proxy (IAP). To learn more about taking a similarly dynamic, flexible approach to security when planning device deployments, check out the second edition in Google Cloud’s best practice series, which shares recommendations for IT decision-makers deploying Android and Chrome devices.     Print       Email Published: 1 min ago on April 21, 2017 By: Foreign Affairs Publisher Last Modified: April 21, 2017 @ 6:10 am Filed Under: Business, Computer Technologies, Economics, English, Global Economy, Google, MIL OSI, MIL OSI Economics, Open Source Intel NEXT ARTICLE → Tomato, tomahto.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Sharp is getting their OLED Fab for Smartphone Displays up to Speed with the Help of Innolux | Main April 20, 2017 Today Google Home's Virtual Assistant can learn its Owner's voice for Security Reasons like Apple's Patent Pending Idea   On April 04 we posted a report titled "Apple Patent Reveals a New Security Feature Coming to Siri," which explained that Apple is working on making Siri understand the voice of the owner as yet another security step in being able to access your future devices and online services to ensure that someone who stole your iDevice can't use it or make purchases online. It was a pretty interesting idea. Two weeks later and we're now learning that Google is putting that feature into their 'Google Home' devices, as of today.   CNN reports that "As of Thursday the square, cylindrical device will now recognize partners, roommates, kids and guests who come to visit. Also, Google Home users can now create up to six different accounts on their devices.   So when you say the trigger phrases "OK Google" or "Hey Google," the Home will listen for who is asking and provide answers based on your voice. For example, Google Assistant will know what's on your calendar, what your reminders are and what your commute looks like.   It will also know when someone talking to it doesn't have a profile, preventing personal data being read aloud to someone it doesn't belong to. For instance, if a guest asks what someone's calendar looks like, Google won't read it.   Apple's published patent application for Siri's similar feature was completely coincidental, as Google's patent patent application for this feature surfaced today showing by date that they were ahead of Apple. Of course it'll be up to USPTO to decide who gets the granted first. Late this afternoon Patently Mobile covered Google's patent and you could review the highlights here.   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

By Rob Thubron on Apr 20, 2017, 6:15 AM TechSpot Google, a company that generated over $60 billion from online advertising last year, is reportedly planning to introduce an ad blocker directly into Chrome, the world’s most popular web browser. According to The Wall Street Journal, the feature could be switched on by default and become part of the desktop and mobile Chrome experience. But it won’t filter out every single online ad; it’ll only block those deemed unacceptable by industry group the Coalition for Better ads, whose members include the likes of Google and Facebook. According to group’s recently released list of ad standards, ad types such as pop-ups, videos that auto-play with sound, and prestitial ads that show countdown timers are all “beneath a threshold of consumer acceptability.” As a way of encouraging publications to avoid displaying these ad formats, the Chrome feature may block all advertisements appearing on sites that use them, rather than just blocking the offending ads themselves. It has been noted, however, that nothing is set in stone. The number of people using third-party extensions such as Adblock Plus is increasing all the time. It’s a practice Google hopes to stop by introducing its own built-in version of the feature, especially as some of the ad blocking companies charge fees in exchange for whitelisting advertisements from certain organizations. Google itself is part of Adblock Plus developer Eyeo GmbH’s “Acceptable Ads” program. In a statement to Ars Technica, a Google spokesperson said: "We do not comment on rumor or speculation. We’ve been working closely with the Coalition for Better Ads and industry trades to explore a multitude of ways Google and other members of the Coalition could support the Better Ads Standards."

By Stephanie Condon for Between the Lines | April 20, 2017 -- 17:24 GMT (10:24 PDT) | Topic: Hardware Google Home now supports up to six different accounts, and users can switch to their own account simply by speaking to the device, Google announced Thursday. Previously, the voice-activated smart speaker could only be connected to a single account. With support for multiple accounts, Google Home can pull up personalized information like playlists and calendar events. A user can link his or her account through the Google Home app. To get the device to recognize your voice, you just say, "Ok Google" and "Hey Google" two times each. Your voice is then analyzed by a neural network, and the device should recognize it thereafter. The new capabilities should be available to Google Home users in the US starting Thursday and will be available in the UK in the coming months. Amazon's competing device, the Echo, supports multiple accounts. It can't yet, however, recognize different voices. To switch accounts, you say to the Echo, "Alexa, switch accounts" or "Alexa, switch to Taylor's profile." Amazon Alexa jumps from speakers to smartphones A problem-solving approach IT workers should learn from robotics engineers Sometimes the most profound solution is to change the entire problem.

Business Apps | 11 Apr 2017 | Print  | Comment (4) Comparing Five iOS Travel Management Apps by Mike Matthews Well over 30 years ago, I had just started a new job when the boss strolled by — and out of the clear, blue, friendly skies asked me to make an airline reservation for him. I had little to go on, just the destination airport, travel days, and some rough travel times. I had no idea about his airline preferences, much less whether he preferred window or aisle seating. Back in those days, you called a travel agent and stepped through the process of getting a ticket delivered to your door. Or, if you wanted to make sure the travel agent was on target, you could do a little of the legwork yourself first by looking up flights in the Official Airline Guide, a thick book with tiny phonebook type. I eventually located a suitable set of flights and passed the info on to his assistant, who dutifully typed the itinerary on an index card for him to carry in his pocket. How times have changed! Airlines now offer booking Web sites, their own apps, and mobile boarding passes. Plus, you can quickly and easily research flights, hotels, rental cars, and more with apps that are dedicated to that purpose. But two things haven’t changed: travel is still a very personal thing, and I’m still looking for the best way to keep all my travel info in one place. The index card approach just doesn’t cut it today. Over the years, I’ve done a fair bit of traveling, both business and personal, and here’s what I’m looking for in a travel management app: Easy and largely automatic itinerary creation The capability to share an itinerary with others Automatic updates for flight changes Syncing of data across multiple devices Notifications in as many ways as possible Thoroughness, with all the bases covered A streamlined interface, ideally allowing one-handed use while on the move through an airport There are a number of candidates in the App Store, but these five stood out: Google Trips, App in the Air, Kayak, TripCase, and TripIt. All the apps have most of the same basic features. After you set up an account with their service, they scan your email inbox for details about a trip (flight times, hotel bookings, etc.) and build an itinerary for you. With most of the apps, you can also either forward booking emails you’ve received to a standard address to create the itinerary or enter the details manually. Once the trip is in place, the app generates additional information such as airport info and local weather, and adds it to your itinerary. You can share the trip with others, add the details to your calendar, and receive trip-related notifications such as check-in times and flight delays. If you’re on the move, your travel plans should move with you in the most convenient way possible. So all these apps make their data accessible on different devices, and most of them extend a subset of their features to the Apple Watch. Only Google Trips lacks an Apple Watch app, and of the other four, only TripIt doesn’t include a complication that can show at-a-glance flight details such as gate information, time to check-in, and baggage claim carousels. Also, all but Google Trips include a Messages app, which can be helpful if you regularly need to share trip details in conversations. Beyond these basics, there’s plenty of room for each app to differentiate itself, be it through the use of crowdsourcing, packing lists, flight trackers, or the ability to book travel from within the app. In short, there’s probably an app in this group with features that will best fit your needs. We can’t cover every nuance in this article, but let’s take a look at some of the more interesting features. Google Trips -- Google is nearly ubiquitous and its services are generally regarded as being top tier. Plenty of people rely on Google while planning and booking travel plans, so organizing travel information with the free Google Trips app seems like a reasonable extension of its services. Setup is simple. You allow the app to access your location while using it, allow notifications about your trip to be sent to you, and sign in with your Google account, giving the app permission to detect past and future trips from information it can find in your Gmail account. From there, the app’s real strength appears, as it suggests things to do, creates customizable daily itineraries of places to go, provides food and drink recommendations, covers how to get around in the local area, and offers “need to know” facts such as emergency numbers, shopping, and tipping info. Plus, it lets you download all this information from Google for offline viewing. Making use of Google’s vast collection of the world’s knowledge is easily the strongest part of the app. However, Google Trips is the newest of the five apps in the group and lacks many features that the others have. If you don’t use Gmail as your primary email provider, Google Trips won’t be nearly as useful. You can add a trip manually, but unlike the other services, Google doesn’t offer a standard email address to which your booking emails can be forwarded to create an itinerary. Many of the other four apps offer at least some notification options. Google Trips itself contains no notification settings within the app, just the opportunity during setup to enable them — but offers no specifics as to what the notifications are. Also, in the current version of the app, you can’t share itineraries, which may be a deal-breaker for many people. There’s also just an iPhone app; no iPad, Apple Watch, or Messages app. And now a confession: I don’t use Google’s services much. As such, Google Trips has limited value for me because it relies heavily on harvesting flight data from a Google account. As the new app on the block, it’s also missing basic features that the other more mature apps have. But if you’re waist-deep in the Google ecosystem, the way the app makes it easy to explore your destination might make it the ideal solution for you or as a companion to one of the other apps. App in the Air -- Not surprisingly, given its name, the free App in the Air focuses on managing air travel but has recently begun to branch out by allowing you to include hotel and car rental details in your itinerary. Flights are organized into cards. Tapping a card reveals all the details from a generous selection of up to 16 customizable widgets, including a timeline, airport and airline info, an online check-in form, maps, wait times, hotel and car rental details, and more. Unique among the five apps, App in the Air presents flight information in a timeline of four segments: Check-in, Boarding, Take-off, and Landing. Knowing these four items in a flight’s timeline can help you prepare for your flight and keep family and business associates in the loop as to your schedule. You can also allow App in the Air to access your calendar to import existing flights and access your contacts for itinerary notifications. App in the Air offers plenty of push and text alerts that you can activate individually (including one for in-flight exercises), but you’ll need a subscription to make them work. Other premium features ($29.99 per year with a free 14-day trial or $49.99 for lifetime access) include a family subscription and unlimited auto check-in. As with many freemium apps, it sports a long list of in-app purchases that range from disabling ads for $0.99 to a lifetime subscription for flight alerts for $49.99. Other notable features include: You can subscribe family and friends to flight alerts too, keeping them in the loop should your itinerary change. Some of the widgets are innovative. One allows you to track your luggage on American Airlines flights. The TSA Rules widget lets you enter an item and responds with rules about whether the item may be carried on board or must be stowed in checked bags. And sometimes widgets appear only if they are relevant; for example, the Uber widget shows up only if there’s service where you are. If you enter your passport information, App in the Air can theoretically check you in for flights automatically. I couldn’t get this feature to work, perhaps because I didn’t have an active subscription, but it would come in handy for airlines like Southwest that don’t assign seats in advance. You can export trips to any of your calendars, which can save you the extra step of downloading flight itineraries from an airline’s Web site and adding them to your calendar. You can import itineraries from TripIt. So if, for example, you want to switch from using TripIt or your company has standardized on TripIt, but you prefer the App in the Air interface or features, it’s easy to do so. You can also import flight plans by scanning your boarding pass or from the boarding pass stored in Apple’s Wallet app; on the back of the pass, just tap Share Pass, then tap App in the Air. If you’re into tracking your travel, let App in the Air do the heavy lifting. It can log miles, hours, airports, and more. You can also earn badges for your achievements. There’s even a whimsical award for Time Travel, but you’ll need to supply your own flux capacitor. To help you get through airports more efficiently, App in the Air includes maps and crowdsourced wait times for check-in, passport processing, and security. If you’re still using scraps of paper to track what to pack, you might like App in the Air’s editable packing list. App in the Air can help you track loyalty points for airlines, hotels, rental cars, and other entities, but the feature is relatively limited, particularly for U.S. airlines. It also requires creating yet another account, with Points Loyalty Wallet. There’s a lot to like in App in the Air and there’s likely more to come. The cost to enable the additional features provided by the subscription isn’t cheap. But if you fly regularly, the lifetime subscription is probably a worthwhile bet to place, since the app receives regular feature updates. I highly recommend App in the Air. Kayak -- Now owned by Priceline, the free Kayak app boasts a long list of travel-related features. Most notably it helps you find and book flights, hotel rooms, and rental cars; and provides a top-notch interface. You can filter your searches by a multitude of categories, including price, non-stop flights, car type, hotel brands, amenities, and much more. When the search results are presented you can book them, or in the case of flights and hotel rooms, set up a price alert. Kayak does a nice job suggesting whether it makes sense to buy an airline ticket immediately, or to wait a while and see if prices come down. Kayak takes travel planning a step further with its Explore feature. You set parameters for your trip, such as a budget, time of year, location, and activities, and Kayak responds with suggestions. Along with all the basics, once a trip is created, you can also add related events and details such as meetings, dinners, and local transportation, a plus for business travelers. One-upping App in the Air, Kayak automatically creates a calendar feed with all your itineraries, so if information about the trip changes, it’s automatically updated in your calendar. To get the URL for the calendar feed, you’ll need to log in to Kayak on the Web and look in Trips Settings. Kayak recently added the capability to import booking confirmations automatically from Gmail accounts. That’s a nice improvement, but like Google Trips, it works only with Gmail while App in the Air and TripIt can sift through the inboxes of many more email services. Kayak provides a number of other niceties: Kayak’s flight tracker isn’t limited to just the flights you travel on. You can track any flight you want; that’s helpful if you’re the one making the airport run to pick up Grandma. It can automatically share all new trips with others via email. Kayak even provides the option of letting others edit the trip, which would be useful for an administrative aide to add a meeting for a traveling boss. When you add a hotel manually to an itinerary, Kayak automatically fills in the address, phone number, and URL for the property. Hotel details include a section on nearby restaurants (courtesy of OpenTable, another Priceline company) and a Show Driver button that displays the hotel address to show a driver if there’s a language barrier. In addition to email, SMS, and notifications, Kayak can also send flight status alerts via Facebook Messenger. You can use autofill for your contact info, pulling your data out of your Contacts app with a couple of taps. These autofill settings can be kept in sync through iCloud. So if you change any of your contact info — say, your home address — you can change it on one device and let iCloud handle the syncing with the rest of your devices. Kayak is the only app of the bunch that has an Apple TV app. That makes it easier for people to do travel planning together… and I’ll bet those shots of the French Riviera on a 60-inch TV screen are enticing. While it’s a good fit for personal travel, Kayak also works well for business travelers, who can use the app to include meetings and other events in their itineraries, follow flight plans of co-workers, and allow others to edit their trips. If you’re looking for a single app to plan, book, and manage travel, you can’t go wrong with Kayak, especially given that it’s entirely free. TripCase -- Our next entry is TripCase, which is owned by Sabre — perhaps the first company to get into the real-time, computer-based air travel booking business. TripCase provides a full array of travel management tools, including several that target business travelers. Unlike the other apps, after you set up an account and complete your profile (which you must do to use TripCase), TripCase doesn’t search through your email for travel info and automatically build itineraries. Instead, you either: Forward email confirmation messages with travel info to trips@tripcase.com or enter the details manually. Use a TripCase affiliate to do bookings, in which case, the details will automatically be added to your account. An affiliate is any airline, travel agency, company travel department, or supplier that uses TripCase’s technology to automatically import reservations into a traveler’s TripCase account. Unfortunately, there’s no list of affiliates to be found online or in the app, so your results may be hit-and-miss. Neither of these is as friction-free as having the app look through your inbox. And the mystery surrounding the affiliates isn’t good, either — two demerits. Once you have a trip built, you can add activities such as meetings, restaurants, and attractions, and the app provides access to Uber, airport maps, weather, and other information right within the trip. Separate screens provide links to restaurants and things to see and do at your destination. TripCase offers the usual trappings, such as push/email alerts and the capability to share trips with others, although updates other than flight changes are not sent automatically to people you designate. However, if those people sign up for TripCase, your trip appears in a convenient Following list, with full updates — a handy feature for business travelers. On the calendar side, TripCase lets you do a one-time import of your trips, or it can create a calendar feed that will update itself. Of course, there’s more: TripCase shows a Tripfeed in its details screen that may include helpful information such as a link to an airport map or ads that suggest you buy various trip-related items such as travel insurance, an audiobook for the flight, and an airport lounge ticket. Unfortunately, there’s no way to turn off the ads with an in-app purchase. TripCase offers (for a $5.99 in-app purchase good for a year after a 1-month trial period) the option of storing images of your receipts as PDF files to save time when filling out expense reports, a welcome feature for business travelers. You can use TripCase to search for alternate flights for future trips you have planned. An Apple Watch app displays an itinerary as well as nearby locations. But while the complication appears in the list contained in the Watch app, it would not appear as an option under the Faces section of the app. TripCase is clearly built for business travelers. But it feels incredibly dated in terms of look and feel and lacks too many standard features that its counterparts have. Unless your company mandates its use, I recommend looking elsewhere because there are better options. TripIt -- As with a couple of the other apps, TripIt is part of a larger company’s travel portfolio. It’s owned by Concur Technologies, which provides travel and expense management services to businesses. Concur also owns Hipmunk, another app that can book flights and hotels. Combine the two and you have a travel solution aimed squarely at business travelers. TripIt has all the basics covered and, like Kayak and TripCase, you can manually beef up your itineraries with additional travel plans, such as train or ferry trips, and activities like meetings or theater outings. TripIt provides a calendar feed that maintains updated itineraries in your calendar app. You can share trips, which isn’t unusual, but TripIt allows you to share only parts of your itinerary, so you could choose to share flight info but not hotel arrangements, for example. For $49 per year, you can upgrade to TripIt Pro and get flight status alerts by text or email, reward tracking with a number of vendors, check-in reminders, automatic trip sharing, flight refund monitoring, and more. That cost is higher than what other apps charge, but you can try TripIt Pro for 30 days for free. TripIt is big on social via its Network feature, offering a dizzying array of options, including: You can post travel plans to LinkedIn, Facebook, Yammer, and Salesforce Chatter. You can add connections to other people either manually or through your Google or Yahoo email accounts. Once connections are made, you and your connection can each see summaries of each other’s trips. In addition, TripIt can spot when connections are near each other when travel plans overlap. TripIt Pro users can create an “inner circle,” members of which see your detailed itineraries and get automatic notifications when you create new trips. People in your inner circle do not have to be TripIt Pro users and trip information is shared only from you to them, not the other way. You can optionally choose to allow an inner circle member to edit your trips, which might be handy if your assistant regularly handles such details anyway. You can designate individual trips as private to avoid sharing trip information, even with your inner circle. And that’s not all: TripIt stores an extended set of profile info, including space for travel documents like your passport, TSA Pre, CLEAR, and driver license. It can also store travel-related contacts such as emergency contacts, house sitters, boarding kennels, and so on. Like App in the Air, TripIt can track basic travel stats. There are no medals for achievements, though. You can create groups for free. People with email addresses with the same domain (think companies) can use a shared calendar to coordinate travel schedules and see other group members’ trips and locations on a map. Trips can also be made private. For $29 per month for up to 10 users (with prices scaling up to $159 per month for 100 users), an organization can subscribe to TripIt for Teams, which offers the group features above along with team-wide spending reports and a travel dashboard that shows all of the team’s travel plans in one place. It’s best suited for an organization that has a department arranging travel for others. TripIt is solid on all fronts and works equally well for both personal and business travel. If you travel a lot, the Pro features are a must-have. Unless you have a big problem with using a separate app to book travel, TripIt has you covered. Book It -- Let’s wrap it up. All five of these apps can work for personal travel, but Kayak, App in the Air, and TripIt are clearly ahead of Google Trips and TripCase thanks to a more complete set of features. Kayak and TripIt are best suited for business travelers given their capability to add other activities to trip itineraries, and the inclusion of TripIt’s $49 Pro package gives it a slight edge over Kayak for business travelers. With its features that appeal to groups and teams, TripIt is the best option for organizations that need to manage complex travel calendars and costs, bolstering its position as the best app for business travelers.   Make friends and influence people by sponsoring TidBITS!

Receive comments via RSS Add a comment Simon   2017-04-18 19:25 I'm not a big fan of "free" services. I don't like myself or my data being sold off beyond my control. I prefer paying up front for services just as I expect to be paid a salary for my own work. So with that said, no way I'm relying on some google stuff. A couple years ago I bought Flight Update and I have used it a lot since on various iPhones. I saved all my travel itineraries and used it to keep me updated about changes, remind me of layover times, even plot the great circle route for my long haul flights. Everything was just fine until a few months ago when out of thin air the app stopped working. At first I thought it was just some communications issue when it couldn't load details for a flight number. Quickly after that I realized though it was happening to all the flights I entered. So it turns out that the app has ceased to work. Anybody who wants to continue to use it will have to buy the new "Pro" version for $10. And if you want to migrate your data, you have to go through some convoluted process to move it from the previous paid (but no longer supported and working) app to the new more expensive (and supported for nobody knows how long) "pro" app. I really liked the app and I'm sure Flight Update Pro is great too, but there is no way in hell I would ever support a company that pulls these kinds of shenanigans on its paying customers. Shutting off a working app without warning and expecting people to pay for another app just to regain lost functionality they had already paid for and on top of it all not preserving data (w/o extra user effort) cannot go unpunished. So that leads me to my question. What other app can I get to replace this formerly great app? The apps the author proposes seem to focus on automation and sharing. I'm not interested in any of that. I'm fine entering my data by hand, I prefer my privacy. I don't need to share my travel details with anybody and if I do a simple txt email fwd is good enough. I prefer a simple and clean interface with quick and seamless information updates in real time. Especially if I don't have to sell myself out to a company like Google to have this done "for me". Any suggestions?

That's a great review. Unfortunately his app of choice is Flight Update Pro which I will not pay for after the cr*p they recently pulled when they broke their other paid app. His number two seems to be The FlightTracker. It's only $4. I'll probably give that a spin. Reply Mike Matthews   2017-04-19 14:09 I'd give Kayak a look. True, you have to give them your data, but it's been very good (and timely) for me when it comes to traveler, pick-up, and drop-off notifications (flight changes, check-in reminders, baggage claim carousels, etc.) via email or text. See the Trips settings. Reply  Search   Unless otherwise noted, this article is copyright © 2017 Mike Matthews TidBITS is copyright © 2017 TidBITS Publishing Inc.

The new feature uses voice recognition to distinguish between up to six people whose accounts are connected to a single Google Home speaker, allowing the Assistant to offer personalized information, music playlists, and other features for each individual. Each user will have to link their accounts to the Home speaker via its companion app, and will then have to train the device to recognize their voice by saying the phrases "Ok Google" and "Hey Google" twice. "Those phrases are then analyzed by a neural network, which can detect certain characteristics of a person's voice," Google's Yury Pinsky explained today. "From that point on, any time you say "Ok Google" or "Hey Google" to your Google Home, the neural network will compare the sound of your voice to its previous analysis so it can understand if it's you speaking or not." Multi-user support for Google Home is beginning to roll out for users in the US from today. The company said that it will expand that support to the UK "in the coming months." Google Home went on sale in the UK two weeks ago, priced at £129, following its launch last year in the US, where it costs $129.

(This story is by Derek Carson of the Bennington Banner, in which it first appeared April 19, 2017.) BENNINGTON — Most locals understand the difference between Bennington, population 15,764, and Woodford, population 424. Google, however, has been known to confuse the two, which the Bennington Area Chamber of Commerce is saying could cause real problems. The specific issue users face is that, for many locations in Bennington on the popular search engine, addresses incorrectly display as being in Woodford. The issue seems to stem from Bennington and Woodford sharing a ZIP code: A cursory search shows that several locations in Searsburg, which shares a ZIP code with Wilmington, and Sandgate, which shares a code with Arlington, are displaying incorrectly as well. According to Chamber Executive Director Matthew Harrington, a task force spearheaded by Lynn Green, owner of the Four Chimneys Inn, has been working to address the issue. In late March, Harrington and Green made a presentation to the state attorney general’s office in hopes of getting the issue resolved. Harrington said the AG’s office has reached out to Google and that conversations are ongoing. On Wednesday, most addresses in Bennington were displaying correctly. But several, including the Bennington Battle Monument and Mount Anthony Union Middle School, are listed as being in Woodford. In November, a Google spokesperson said the quickest way for users to correct an address was to select the “send feedback” tool. The chamber, operating off the same information, painstakingly submitted a correction for each member businesses, only to see the listings revert to Woodford in the following weeks. The chamber tried again, but the changes again reverted. “You can’t just go in and change them, because they just change back,” said Harrington. “We felt we didn’t really have a voice (with Google), as the chamber or as a town,” he said, which led officials to reach out to the attorney general, who they hoped might have more sway with the tech giant. While the problem may seem to be superficial, Harrington pointed out that there could be serious consequences. “If you’re a tourist coming here for the first time, it can be frustrating. If you’re trying to buy a home, you can’t get a feel for the area.” He said one chamber member business almost lost a major client who believed the business had moved out of Bennington. In their presentation before the AG’s office, Green and Harrington also pointed out that, if someone experiencing an emergency looks up an address, and that address doesn’t match the 911 database, it could lead to confusion and potentially disaster. Mail delivery could also be affected if someone fills out an address based on a Google search.

SEO & intelligent content: Discovery, connection and improved performance Jim Yu explains how search data can be used to better understand your customers, allowing you to create targeted, 'intelligent' content that will really move the needle. Jim Yu on April 20, 2017 at 1:41 pm More Customer journeys have evolved significantly in their complexity, with the sheer amount of touch points possible exploding due to digital advancements. Mobile has risen to number one, in terms of consumer use and accessibility; hyperlocal has become a paramount focus of strategy; and intelligent content marketing is now critical to success. It is more important than ever for marketers to cut a clear pathway from the consumer to their brand by cultivating a symbiotic relationship between SEO and content marketing. Marketers already recognize the combined necessity of SEO and content, as growth in both areas is projected to increase significantly. Budget for SEO-related tasks is expected to grow from an estimated $65 billion in 2016 to nearly $80 billion by 2020. In sync with this growth is the jump in content production, as 70 percent of B2B content marketers and 73 percent of B2C content marketers say they intend to publish more content in 2017 than they did in 2016. However, although content is being produced at higher rates, many marketers still struggle to engage readers with their material. In fact, only 20 percent of content produced in the B2C sector typically sees engagement (registration required), with B2B marketers seeing slightly better results at 50 percent engagement. As brands press forward with their content production, it is clear that they must learn how to better meet the needs of their current and prospective visitors. The answer is not just more content — it is producing intelligent content. It is only when the SEO and the content production teams can work together that organizations will be able to move move the needle on content performance. Discovery and understanding user intent First and foremost, content and SEO strategy must be built to address user intent — understanding what information consumers desire when they type a query into the search bar, and even further, how they intend to purpose that information. The better you understand what they want to read and what they seek online, the easier it will be to provide them with the material they want. There are three main types of search intent: Navigational intent refers to intent focused on reaching a particular site. Consumers with these queries already have their end destination in mind. Informational intent refers to people who search because they desire to obtain information in order to learn about something specific. Transactional intent queries are the searches made with the intent to purchase something. Google works to align its SERPs to searcher intent in order to provide a better user experience. For example, back in 2016, Google removed sidebar ads and increased the number of slots for paid positions above organic results on the SERP. For certain “highly commercial” queries, as many as four ads now appear above organic results. Evidently, they determined that those performing transactional searches would be better served by ads than those performing informational searches. Our own research at BrightEdge has uncovered a few patterns in these SERP layouts. For example, queries with transactional intent are six times more likely to claim paid positions at the top of the SERP. Results that are more informational, however, have a 69 percent higher click-through rate when featured as one of the top five results, as compared to the transactional queries. It is clear from our research that the intent of the customer has a clear impact on how SERP results are displayed by Google. Brands that can understand these differences are more equipped to create content that addresses users’ needs. Creating intelligent content to align with audiences in meaningful ways Armed with insight into the intent of searchers, brands must now focus on creating optimized content that ranks highly, encourages clicks and engages visitors arriving on the page. “Intelligent content” is created by understanding what consumers want to read and when, thus boosting the brand in the eyes of the target audience. Brands need to keep a finger on the pulse of topics and trends currently enticing their audiences, in order to create this intelligent content. They should be monitoring trends to see what people search for and the level of competition for these different applicable keywords. When brands do this well, they can pick up on rising trends within their industry and get high-quality content published before their competitors, thus establishing themselves as experts. Keyword lists can also be developed following competitive analysis, where brands identify content and keywords for which their competitors rank. Understanding the terms and topics that bring customers to other brands can provide excellent ideas for content production. Brands should also simply research popular keywords in their particular sector. Using these different strategies together will allow organizations to build a strong keyword list and identify key topics that can be used to guide content development. As the content is created, brands should be optimizing it for the applicable user intent and the targeted buyer’s persona. This requires incorporating Google’s micro-moments into content development strategies and generating material that fits into at least one of Google’s four micro-moment categories –– I-want-to-buy, I-want-to-know, I-want-to-do and I-want-to-go moments. For example, I-want-to-go micro-moments should be optimized for local search with local targeted keywords and local-focused content. Capitalizing on machine learning Machine learning has already become an important element in content strategy, and it will likely continue to grow in importance, to help brands develop the right content for their consumers. Machine learning has been making significant inroads into the world of content development; for example, Google’s RankBrain. For marketers, machine learning has the potential to unlock insight into consumer behavior patterns, so marketers can anticipate what content prospective customers want to be served. When customers visit a website, they leave behind countless data points such as what and where they have clicked, how long they remain on respective pages, how they arrive on the website, geographic location and whether they are unique or returning visitors. When brands are able to monitor this data and scale their insights to all visitors, they can start to form an understanding of the different types of visitors arriving on the site, where those prospects are in their buyer’s journey, and the types of content that will be most helpful for these personas moving forward. Unfortunately, the sheer amount of data available can be overwhelming. By 2020, the amount of data available in the digital ecosystem is expected to increase from 130 exabytes to 40,000, making it impossible for marketers to single-handedly sort through the information available. It will be the job of machine learning capabilities to gather the information and generate actionable tasks for marketers. The insight gained from this data will then empower brands to start to develop content for particular personas at different stages, and provide them with a more personalized experience to engage users more effectively. In order to gauge the success of these endeavors, marketers must pair machine learning with accurate SEO and content metrics. Content should be monitored to harvest data on: the rankings attained on the SERP for applicable keywords. the click-through rate from the SERP. the engagement of visitors once they have landed on the page. the visitor journey through the website following review of the initial content that brought them there. your conversion rate from visitors to leads, and then leads to customers. These statistics will help ensure that your machine-learning-guided efforts have been successful and can offer insight about where to go next. The statistics that offer immediate information on the performance of the content and its impact on the brand’s revenue can also be easily transformed into reports and visuals to present to the leaders of the company. Perform: Make SEO and intelligent content work for you In summary, to make SEO and intelligent content work for their brands, marketers need to focus on these five points: Understand how user intent impacts your rankings and engagement. Develop keyword lists and content strategies around user needs. Create content that aligns with micro-moments and the non-linear customer journey. Utilize machine learning to gain insight into your audience and automate elements of workflow. Use solid SEO metrics to monitor your content marketing progress and make adjustments as needed. The increase in content marketing spend and the attention spent on understanding search intent suggests that SEO and content marketing disciplines are finally converging. That said, key challenges remain in optimizing that content and pushing content marketing to new heights. Going forward, it is vital that marketers take a more intelligent approach to how they produce, optimize and measure content. Marketers who understand how they can use search data to better understand their customers are well-poised to create targeted content that is measurably impactful.

Google Home can now support and distinguish up to six separate users The new feature, which rolls out today, enables multiple users to receive personalized results. Greg Sterling on April 20, 2017 at 12:00 pm More Google Home will now support up to six users. In other words, it has the capacity to recognize and distinguish the voices of multiple users for personalized content and results. This extends to news, music, scheduling, commute times and so on. To set this up, users need the most up-to-date version of the Google Home app. Each individual will need to link a Google account and set up preferences in the app. There’s also a short “training” process that requires each person to say “Ok Google” or “Hey Google” twice. Google then does an audio/voice analysis to determine which person is speaking: From that point on, any time you say “Ok Google” or “Hey Google” to your Google Home, the neural network will compare the sound of your voice to its previous analysis so we can understand if it’s you speaking or not. This comparison takes place only on your device, in a matter of milliseconds. Google said multiple-user support will roll out today in the US, and in the UK in the “coming months.” Amazon will be compelled to match the capability for its Alexa devices, though it’s not clear how quickly it can.

Computing Phones Cars Gaming Science Extreme Deep Dives Deals About ExtremeTech ET Forums Contact ExtremeTech Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ziff Davis Home Internet US congressman to constituents: ‘nobody’s got to use the internet’ US congressman to constituents: ‘nobody’s got to use the internet’ By Joel Hruska on April 18, 2017 at 7:30 am Comment Congress and the President, historically, don’t have the best grasp of how the internet works or ought to be managed. This tendency cuts across both parties, from Ted Stevens’ (R-Alaska) infamous comments about a “series of tubes,” to bipartisan (though somewhat Democratic-leaning) SOPA support, to Trump’s declaration in December 2015 that we should ‘close the internet‘ as a means of stopping terrorism. If you’re waiting for Congress or the president to display a true, deep grasp of technology, you’re going to be waiting awhile. That said, Representative Jim Sensenbrenner (R-WI) has set a new (albeit temporary) record for “Congressional Representative With No Idea How the Real World Works These Days.” During a town hall meeting last week, Sensenbrenner argued that ISPs shouldn’t face regulations separate from what a company like Facebook faces when it wants to monetize your personal information. (Whether FB should have access to what it wants to sell is an argument for a different time). When challenged on this claim by someone who correctly understood that Facebook and your ISP have very different levels of access to your personal data, Sensenbrenner said the following: You know, again, nobody’s got to use the internet. And the thing is, if you start regulating the internet like a utility, if you did that right at the beginning, we’d have no internet. Internet companies have invested an awful lot of money in having almost universal services, now. And the fact is, you know, I don’t think it’s my job to tell you that you cannot get advertising through your information being sold. My job, I think, is to tell you that you have the opportunity to do it and then you take it upon yourself to make the choice that the government should give you. And that’s what the law has been and I think we ought to have more choices, rather than fewer choices. First off, Sensenbrenner is right when he says that by waiving the FCC’s privacy rules, Congress is merely returning to the initial status quo. The FCC’s rules never went into effect, so functionally, nothing changed when Congress overruled it. Luckily, he makes up for it by being completely wrong in almost everything he says thereafter (his remarks about ISPs investing in broadband infrastructure are vague, but true). .@JimPressOffice tells his constituents not to use the internet if they don't like his vote to sell out their privacy to advertisers. #wi05 pic.twitter.com/lSVVx8OclO — Brad Bainum (@bradbainum) April 13, 2017 Sensenbrenner is flatly wrong when he says nobody “has” to use the Internet. Many companies now require job applications to be submitted online. When my fiancée and I recently shopped for a new apartment, multiple property companies informed us that applications for their complexes could only be submitted online. If you’ve signed up for paperless billing (or been signed up for it automatically), your only means of communication with your utility or service providers is likely through an online account. Paper either costs more, or is no longer available. Many work projects these days (including those worked on from home) require access to Google Docs or at least Microsoft Word and email. Don’t have a connection? You can’t do your job. Now, it’s definitely possible to live without personally purchasing internet services and some people still do. That might mean only using a mobile device, visiting a local library, using free Wi-Fi provided by McDonalds or Starbucks, or just finding companies that still do business the old-fashioned way. But most of these alternatives are either substantially less convenient or unworkable in certain situations. You can’t use Wi-Fi if you don’t have a laptop, smartphone, or tablet, and public library access to the internet won’t help you if your library doesn’t offer it. Older phones, with older browsers, may be technically capable of accessing the ‘net, but incapable of doing so at a speed that’s practical. Sensenbrenner’s other comments are a panoply of wrong. The various OECD countries have pursued various strategies for managing broadband and ISP rules. None of them, including those with state-owned providers, have ended up “with no internet.” Furthermore, when home internet access was rolling out in the period he refers to, there were no advertising giants hoovering up data about their users, or selling this information in the open market. In fact, when Google bought DoubleClick back in 2007, one of the promises it had to make to secure permission to do so was that it wouldn’t combine data collected by Google’s other services with data from DoubleClick’s advertising business. Last year, Google came under fire for quietly dropping this policy and moving to combine the two sets of information. Verizon, of course, did it 18 months ago. Sensenbrenner is wrong that strong privacy protections or limits on ISPs data gathering would’ve killed the early internet, because this type of information parsing wasn’t going on in 1997 or 1998. Google agreed to limits on how it used and merged user information back in 2007, and Google clearly hasn’t gone anywhere in the past decade. Finally, Sensenbrenner states, “I don’t think it’s my job to tell you that you cannot get advertising through your information being sold.” He’s ridiculously wrong on this point as well. Polls agree: Republicans, Democrats, and Independents do not like that their data is sold by ISPs. They did not want these privacy restrictions walked back. They do not view allowing the sale of customer data to anyone who might be interested as a positive, and the federal government is, for better or worse, the only other balancing force in the room. Very few people want to get advertising through their information being sold. The cheeky might also note that while advertising was a key component of the TV market, nobody had to sign their TV viewing history away to Clorox in exchange for being allowed to view a bleach commercial. His remarks on choice are nearly offensive when considered against the reality of ISP services today. Most Americans have 1-2 choices for their ISP, at most. There’s no opportunity to move to a service that “does it better,” because those services do not exist. The American Legislative Exchange Council, or ALEC, has a long, proud history of buying, sponsoring, writing, preferring to donate to politicians that support strict regulations on municipal broadband proposals, to the point that such proposals are functionally unworkable due to revenue restrictions, strict subscriber limits, extremely broad definitions for what constitutes “broadband” when determining if a city is underserved, and expensive, long-term multi-year studies that must be completed before any proposal can be put forward. The internet is already a near-necessity today. It’s not hard to imagine it will absolutely be a necessity 10 years from now. Sensenbrenner’s remarks about “choice” assume that meaningful choice exists today when, in reality, it doesn’t.

Computing Phones Cars Gaming Science Extreme Deep Dives Deals About ExtremeTech ET Forums Contact ExtremeTech Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ziff Davis Home Computing How to improve your Wi-Fi range and reception at home How to improve your Wi-Fi range and reception at home By Ryan Whitwam on April 18, 2017 at 10:30 am Comment The ubiquity and low cost of Wi-Fi has freed us all from the tyranny of Ethernet cables, but Wi-Fi still isn’t as foolproof as a cable. Sometimes your Wi-Fi can drop out, get slow, or just plain not work in certain areas of the house. Before you throw up your hands in defeat and go crawling back to the Ethernet cable, here are some things you can do to improve your wireless. Check for firmware updates The hardware is only part of the equation when it comes to good coverage. Your router has software that runs the show behind the scenes, and manufacturers often release new versions that add features and tweak the performance. Upgrading the firmware used to be a huge pain on routers, but it’s better these days. You’ll need to log into your router’s administrator interface or management app. Look for the upgrade option and pull the trigger. Some old routers require you to download the firmware from the manufacturer’s website and upload it to the router manually. Some new routers make it even easier by installing updates silently in the background when you’re not actively using the connection. This might need to be turned on in the settings, but Google’s routers do this by default. A few routers can also be flashed with third-party firmware like DD-WRT that have more options. However, you can brick the device if you’re not careful. Move the router Most routers look like computer equipment, what with all those antennas and blinking lights. So, the instinct is to put them someplace out of the way, or maybe even in a cabinet. That’s not good for signal strength, though. That just means the signal will be weaker by the time it reaches your devices. Your router will work better if it’s in a central location, usually higher up. You should also keep it clear of other devices that operate in the 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands as that can cause interference (such as from microwaves). There are some routers designed to be stylish or understated that you can put out in the open, but you might have to stare at your unsightly router if buying a new one isn’t an option. You can use your phone to test the signal strength around the house as you re-position the router. Grab a signal strength monitor app (there are dozens of them) and take a stroll around. If by some miracle you have access to a phone with Google Tango, you can create a 3D map of the space with Wi-Fi strength overlaid. Change wireless channels Routers all operate in the 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands, but there are different ranges within each that your network can operate within. Check your router’s settings, and you should have an option to manually change the channel. But what should you change it to? That depends what’s the most open channel. On Windows, you can use the command prompt line netsh wlan show all  to see nearby networks and the channel they are on. It’s easier to use your smartphone, though. Most network testing apps will show you WiFi channels. Simply set your router to a channel with lower usage in the area, and you should boost your connectivity. Replace the antenna (if you have one) Most routers still have external antennas, and the stock ones will be fine for most people. However, if you’re having connectivity issues, you can look at getting a more robust antenna for your unit. A new antenna will cost under $20, but it won’t make your router more powerful. An aftermarket antenna is about changing the shape of your signal. For example, if you can’t get your router into a convenient central location, you can get an antenna with a cable that lets you place it in a more open area away from the main router. You can also get a high-gain antenna that projects more effectively at a distance, or one that can be used to direct the signal in a certain direction. Pick up a range extender If your router can’t handle the job no matter what you do, it may be time to get it some help. A range extender or repeater can expand your network coverage without the expense of getting a whole new router. There are systems that run your network over power lines to output Wi-Fi where you need it, and others that simply pick up the Wi-Fi signal and transmits a boosted signal for your devices to connect to. One major drawback of range extenders is they can be tricky to set up. Settings changes to your router can also mean you have to completely redo the setup process. Move to a mesh router system In the event you can’t get your router to play nice and a range extender isn’t cutting it, you may be in the market for a mesh router system. These have become quite popular over the last few years with networking veterans like Netgear and Linksys diving in. There are also newcomers to networking like Google, Eero, and Luma with mesh Wi-Fi systems. A mesh network consists of multiple access points that can be managed as a single unit. They use a little network capacity to maintain the connection between APs, but you get vastly better coverage if you spread them around the house. Your devices will be connected to the AP with the best connection as you move around, too. Our sister site PCMag gives strong recommendations to both the Netgear Orbi and Linksys Velop. Those are both around $400 for the base-level bundle. Google Wifi is reviewed well also, and it’s $100 less expensive.

Google says that starting today, Google Home supports multiple users. Up to six people can connect their Google account to a Google Home, and the unit will try to distinguish each person’s voice from the other users connected to the device. This way, each person can hear their schedule, playlists, and more. Support for multiple users is rolling out in the US now and will be available in the UK in the coming months. To know if the feature is available to you, launch the Google Home app and look for a card that says “Multi-user is available.” You can also click the icon in the upper right corner, find your Google Home, and select “Link your account”. From there, you’ll train the Google Assistant to recognize your voice so that it knows it’s you when you’re talking and not the other people with connected accounts. You’ll say “Ok Google” and “Hey Google” twice each.  This is a major new feature that’ll make Google Home a much better product. Previously, only one person’s Google account could be connected to a Google Home at a time, meaning that all of the news, schedules, playlists, and more were tailored for them. Now that multiple accounts can be used at once, the Google Home is a much more of a family-friendly device.

This is a pretty surprising development given the company’s status as one of the major players in the online advertising business. People familiar with Google’s plans say that the ad-blocking tool will come out within weeks and be switched on by default in the mobile and desktop version of Chrome. It’s set to only filter out specific types of ads considered to provide bad experiences for people. Google could determine which ads fall under this criteria based on the list of ad standards defined by the Coalition for Better Ads. This includes pop-ups, prestitial ads that use countdown timers, and auto-playing videos with sound. Also See: Google rolls out fix for annoying page jumps in Chrome Google is reportedly still trying to iron out the kinks and may eventually decide not to move ahead with the plan. It’s supposedly thinking of blocking all ads on a site that features bad ads rather than just the offending ads themselves. This would force site owners to make sure all their advertising was up to the mark or face losing out on all their revenue. Google had previously stated that it wouldn’t build ad-blocking into Chrome and has taken steps to punish sites which use annoying ads. Its new turn-about is apparently a defensive strike against ad-blocking software. It hopes having its own filter in place will stop the growth of such tools. Some ad-blocking companies like Adblock Plus sell an ‘Acceptable Ads’ program which lets members pass through its filters. Google is at present a paying participant. This won’t have to be the case if it has its own system in place. Furthermore, the popularity of Chrome would allow it to have more control over the ad-blocking sphere than it does now.

lifehacker Deadspin Fusion Gizmodo Jalopnik Jezebel Kotaku Lifehacker The Root Video Skillet Two Cents Vitals Gear Google Home Now Supports Multiple Users and Can Recognize Your Voice Andy OrinYesterday 1:30pm Filed to: google home google voice assistants Smarthome 19 1 Edit Promote Share to Kinja Toggle Conversation tools Go to permalink One of the biggest limitations of Google Home, Google’s voice-controlled speakerbot, was that it couldn’t tell anyone apart so all your requests were centered on one Google account. But thanks to an update today, now it can recognize up to six people. Advertisement That’s a pretty big deal for a device that’s supposed to be a central part of your home. Previously, if you asked it to do something like read your agenda it would only be able to refer to a calendar for a single Google account. Which means that your family, friends, partners, dogs, and cats would all have to share the same calendar if more than one person wanted to use the device. Today’s update lets you add up to six people so that everyone can talk to the Home and actually get personalized responses. I wouldn’t expect perfection, though; you train it by repeating the phrase “Okay Google” or “Hey Google” a few times, but inevitably it will probably confuse people’s voices. Confusing different voices isn’t that big of a deal because Google is still pretty skittish about actually doing things to your Google account through the device. Reasonably so; you don’t want anyone within earshot to send emails on your behalf. Having multiple accounts would especially complicate such features, but hopefully future updates will make the device able to actually do more.

In a hugely significant update announced on Thursday, the firm revealed users asking “Ok, Google. How does my day look?” will receive a personalised response, addressing each user by name. Related: Google Home review That functionality will extend to personalised playlists, commute time, news briefings and other preferences established within the Google Home app. Check it out in the video below: In order to set up the device for shared account use, Google is asking owners to look out for a card that says “multi-user available” within the latest version of the Home app. From here, under the Devices list, they’ll have an option to “Link your account” and teach Google Assistant to understand their dulcet tones. Google explains: “So how does it work? When you connect your account on a Google Home, we ask you to say the phrases "Ok Google" and "Hey Google" two times each. Those phrases are then analyzed by a neural network, which can detect certain characteristics of a person's voice. “From that point on, any time you say "Ok Google" or "Hey Google" to your Google Home, the neural network will compare the sound of your voice to its previous analysis so it can understand if it's you speaking or not. This comparison takes place only on your device, in a matter of milliseconds.” Unfortunately, it’s only available to US Google Home owners from today, but it’ll roll out to early adopters in the UK “in the coming months.” Although Google Home impressed us upon an early review, it has struggled to live up to the functionality of the Amazon Echo, which is currently further along in its development. Individual voice recognition represents a hugely compelling reason for people hoping to use the speaker as an assistant in shared living spaces.

Galaxy S8 and S8+ review: Another pair of excellent mainstream smartphones from Samsung David Ruddock Follow View All Posts 2017/04/18 7:59am PDTApr 18, 2017 20 Plus 1 on G+ 98 Share on Facebook 74 Share on Twitter Total Shares192 Galaxy S8 Galaxy S8+ News Phone Reviews Article Contents 1 The Good 2 The Not So Good 3 Design and materials 4 Display 5 Battery life and charging 6 Storage, wireless, and call quality 7 Audio and speakers 8 Camera 9 Performance 10 Testing notes 11 Software 11.1 What's new 11.1.1 Navigation keys 11.1.2 Bixby 11.1.3 Snap window 11.1.4 Dual audio 11.1.5 Separate app sound 11.1.6 Other changes 11.2 General UI (launcher, notifications, lockscreen, navigation keys) 11.3 Software: Opinion 12 Value 13 Conclusion When you talk about Samsung's Galaxy smartphones, it's hard not to talk about 'the average consumer.' Because the Galaxy S series is the second-most popular line of smartphones on earth, its audience is unashamedly mainstream, and the vast majority of sales of these devices will be to consumers who aren't what you'd call tech-savvy. The issue for Samsung, increasingly, is learning how to split the difference between a smartphone that provides a good experience for everybody and maintaining that all important credibility with its fans and enthusiasts. The Galaxy S8 and S8+, for example, have Quad HD displays - the best ones I've ever seen. But they're set to 1080p by default for improved performance. And as enthusiasts clamor for ever-larger batteries, Samsung has put very average, if not exactly small, ones in these new phones (though they should degrade less noticeably). The S8 is still a slippery metal and glass sandwich that essentially requires additional protection unless you like to live life on the edge, which is great news for case manufacturers, but less so for you and me. And then there's the new fingerprint scanner, which is just a bit tragic (especially on the S8+). Of course, there are big upsides: the latest chipset from Qualcomm, the Snapdragon 835, ensures that the Galaxy S8 will probably have the best LTE performance of any phone on the market here in the US. That chip also brings features like Bluetooth 5.0, improved Wi-Fi performance, and better image signal processors for the cameras. Samsung's Infinity Display is genuinely breathtaking: this is the best screen I've seen on a smartphone, period. The rear-facing camera is still great, the quality of the phone itself seems almost unimpeachable, and Samsung continues to make legitimate value-adds to the smartphone experience with features like Samsung Pay, wireless charging, and advanced network feature support across all four major US carriers. The fact that you can just walk in to a store and buy one generally speaking (ahem, Google) is something worth pointing out, too. Samsung's ubiquity is absolutely a product feature. Like the S7 and S7 edge last year, the S8 and S8+ feel iterative - in a good way. But I also believe they're evidence that what makes a smartphone "great" is becoming more and more subjective. These are great smartphones, but how great really depends a lot on your priorities. The Good Display The best displays I've ever seen on a smartphone. They're bright, they're beautiful, they have excellent viewing angles, and tiny little bezels. You get a ton of screen in a remarkably compact package. Battery I only tested the S8+ in depth, but the battery life on this phone was great. If you disable the always-on display, it gets even better. Camera While I still prefer the Pixel's camera, the S8's has its own strengths, including excellent low-light performance, fast captures, and bright, vivid colors. GraceUX isn't bad TouchWiz has come a long way. Setting aside the conversation about updates, I find GraceUX perfectly good, and Samsung has genuine value-adds in the software these days. Virtual keys FINALLY. Samsung has entered the modern Android era and given us virtual navigation keys. It has noticeably improved my feelings about using a Samsung phone. The Not So Good Fingerprint scanner I actively hate the fingerprint scanner on the S8+. It may be better on the standard S8. But yeah, it's bad. Updates The S8 and S8+ ship with Android 7.0, and I've seen exactly nothing from Samsung indicating they plan to change their attitude about timely Android platform updates. Bixby Is utterly worthless. A waste of a perfectly good hardware key. So much glass I would seriously worry about breaking this phone if I bought it. There is so much glass - Samsung phones essentially require cases. Pricey At $750 and $850 for the S8 and S8+, respectively, there's no denying Samsung is asking a lot for the privilege of joining the Galaxy S club this year. Design and materials Not all glass and metal sandwiches are created equal. With the S8 and S8+, Samsung has proven once again that, yes, there is still room for refinement when it comes to packaging and polishing a smartphone. To call these phones "pretty" would be to do them a disservice (I also don't necessarily think it's true). They have an almost precious quality to them, something that tends to be strongly evoked when you hold them in the slightly awkward "claw" grip a curved-edge smartphone sort of requires. But the phones look and feel so solid - their seams so uniform and tight - that you get the sense they can't even be taken apart, because they must have been forged whole in some kind of dark ritual (especially in this black finish). I don't mean to fawn, but when you compare Samsung's industrial design here on the S8+ to something like the Google Pixel XL, the Pixel looks and feels like yesterday's smartphone. And I don't just mean the bezels. Compare it to the Galaxy S7 edge, and the new S8+ is clearly a more moderate step forward, though. The biggest change is of course the display, which we will get to soon, but let's talk about those bezels. Samsung hasn't made what you'd call a "bezellless" phone (no one has), but their bezel reduction approach is more similar to LG's than, say, Xiaomi's. Instead of making the ludicrous compromise of moving the front-facing camera and various sensors down to the chin of the phone and messing with the earpiece speaker just to achieve that not-bezelless look, Samsung's chopped off some bezel on both the top and bottom. The result is much more screen in a package that doesn't need to grow dramatically to accommodate it. This is the smart approach to maximizing screen to body ratio (conversely, I would argue the Xiaomi approach is not smart). The one compromise Samsung had to make was the home button - it was time for it to go. We'll talk more about the software keys later, but for those of you who liked to tap the home key to quickly check your notifications, be at ease: it has a replacement. The pressure-sensitive, always-on virtual home key can be configured to wake the screen on a double tap or long press for quick glances. As you know, this also means the fingerprint scanner had to be put... somewhere else. Samsung hasn't chosen well. The fingerprint scanner on the Galaxy S8+, in particular, is nothing short of a bad experience. My success rate on reads hovers around 50% at the time of this writing, and it's become a frustration so constant that I've started to feel a bit annoyed by the whole thing. Why couldn't it have gone in a more natural, isolated location below the camera sensor? It's not just the reach - the scanner itself is incredibly finicky about making sure the whole sensor area is covered, and sometimes just doesn't recognize my finger is on it at all. This is not to mention that said scanner is right next to the camera, which has the same sort of raised edge design as the scanner and feels exactly the same to your finger. Unlocking the S8+ with your right hand requires immense discipline and active attention to how you grasp the phone. It isn't even worth the trouble (my fingers are pretty long, by the way). With your left, it's doable as you build up the muscle memory instead of having to actively feel out the scanner. But I use a lot of phones, and this is hands down the worst fingerprint scanner I have used since Samsung's old swipe-to-read ones. It boggles my mind how far backward Samsung has gone with this experience. Even the registration process is annoying: it refused to read any of my attempts to register the sides and edges of my finger because the scanner wasn't completely covered. Anyway, that's my fingerprint scanner rant. Samsung, you messed this up. On the bottom of the phone you'll find the 3.5mm headphone jack, a USB 3.0 Type C port, the microphone, and the outlet for the speaker. The design of the power key is unchanged, but Samsung has switched back to a rocker for the volume key to avoid confusion with the new Bixby button. The buttons all provide good feedback and have a nice, clicky feel. I will say the volume rocker is a bit high up on the S8+, presumably in order to make room for said Bixby key. Out back, the camera hump is gone, meaning you can tap away at the S8 sitting on a flat surface and it won't rock or wobble (at least, not significantly). To the right of the sensor is the fingerprint scanner, and to the left is the flash and Samsung's weirdly persistent heart-rate monitor. On the front, things have become substantially more subdued with this generation of phone. The earpiece speaker is much smaller, the Samsung logo is nowhere to be found (a victory, I would say), and there's no chroming or accents around any of the sensors or front-facing camera. All colors of the Galaxy S8 have black bezels around the screen, so no matter which shade you choose, you'll get a pretty stealthy fascia. Undoubtedly, some of you are coming into this review with a question: S8, or S8+? If you're currently using a Galaxy Note5, S6 edge+, or S7 edge, I would actually advise you to consider the S8 over the larger model I'm testing here. The S8+ is a big phone - as tall as a Nexus 6, if not nearly as wide. This will make pocketability a genuine question for some, especially if you're going to be throwing a case on this big, expensive slab of metal and glass. If you typically find yourself liking a 5.5-5.7" smartphone, I'd say go for the regular S8. But if you do want something bigger, the S8+ offers a ton of screen in a package that is a lot easier to handle than phablets (sorry, sorry) of the past. Because all of the extra display area is packaged vertically, the phone is still very narrow and easy to manage with one hand - for most tasks. Reaching the top of the screen can be a real bear, and that can mean risky maneuvers (i.e., potentially dropping it) to access certain parts of the UI one-handed. I still think it's way easier to manipulate than my old Nexus 6, though. The comparative narrowness makes my grip on it a lot more confidence-inspiring, even if those stretches for the notification bar can feel a bit dicey. And because I wasn't sure where else to put it: Yes, the multi-color notification LED is still there. Even with the reduced bezel, Samsung managed to hold onto it. Display If you're sick and tired of hearing every year that "Samsung has done it again - the best smartphone display ever!" then I am sorry, you will continue to be sick and tired. The Galaxy S8 and S8+ have the best smartphone screens. Ever. They get extremely bright, the colors are exceptionally vivid (or accurate, if you switch to the Basic display mode), viewing angles are excellent, blacks are very deep, and the AMOLED panel can get ultra-dim for those late-night reading sessions. Samsung continues to demonstrate that its Super AMOLED technology is the gold standard for displays with the Galaxy S8, and that the bar can still be raised higher yet. I'm always impressed with Samsung's ability to iterate this technology with such consistent success. While this is a Quad HD panel with a native resolution of 2960x1440 (that's a lot of pixels), Samsung configures the S8 and S8+ out of the box to run at 1080p (2220x1080). Why? Because it improves performance. And that feels like something of a copout, doesn't it? Google can run the Pixel XL with its older, less efficient Snapdragon 821 chip at full QHD resolution and achieve performance and battery life that go toe-to-toe with a fresh-out-of-the-box Galaxy S8+. So, why make the phones QHD at all? VR! At least, that's a convenient scapegoat. Notably, you can change the resolution manually to the full QHD. I'll have a few more words about this in the performance section of the review, so stay tuned. Getting back to the screen, I found it worked well even in direct sunlight, with Samsung's ultra-high contrast overboost mode kicking in to maximize readability even in the most challenging conditions. Sure, that'll drain your battery real fast, but it's better than not being able to see your phone. The Galaxy S8s also have support for HDR video, but I believe it's only the HDR10 standard (not Dolby Vision). As far as I know, this will work with select apps that have specifically optimized for Samsung devices, so I would expect adoption of this in a wide way will be fairly slow for the time being outside the core video services like Netflix and Amazon. Still, it's good to have, because the screens on these phones really do deserve HDR video to fully take advantage of their impressive capabilities - especially those positively inky black levels. I applaud Samsung for continuing to include its helpful screen mode setting, which allows you to choose one of four color profile presets depending on how you want the screen to look. The "basic" mode offers the most unforgivingly accurate reproduction of colors, something I find helpful when reviewing photos. Finally, let's talk about the edge. Last year, I was pretty clear on my feelings about the Galaxy S7 edge having issues properly rejecting fingers or palms at the edge of the display. Because of the way curved-edge displays are shaped and the fact that Samsung curves both the front and the back of the device, it's essentially impossible to hold a curved-edge phone without your fingers or palms touching the edge of the screen. On the S7 edge, this was absolutely maddening at times. It made the phone nearly impossible for me to use if I was lying on my back, for example, doing some email in bed, and it was one of the reasons I stopped using it so quickly after my review period. I am happy to report that it looks like Samsung has given some serious attention to the issue of edge rejection. I tapped out a full email on the S8+ lying back on the couch and didn't get a single misread character or failure to respond to input. I browsed the web, scrolled through Twitter, did some texting, and it all went off without a hitch. That's cause for a sigh of relief - I was really worried Samsung would just continue to act like this issue didn't exist. Battery life and charging I've only been using the Galaxy S8+, so that's the phone I can give you battery life impressions on. My take so far is that battery life is at least as good as the Snapdragon Galaxy S7 edge from last year, a phone that offered above-average performance in this area. In single-day heavy use, the phone could reliably get 5 hours of screen time, sometimes creeping closer to 6 hours. That's very good - exceeding the Pixel XL in performance, even. Will the Exynos variant once again clean Qualcomm's clock on efficiency? I guess we'll have to see how they compare in reviews around the web. Still, the S8+ does really well here, and if you want the version of the phone that's going to be able to power you through the most usage possible, that extra 500mAh of capacity (3500mAh total for the S8+) over the standard S8 isn't anything to sneeze at - and I doubt the larger display cannibalizes all of it. Samsung has also claimed that these batteries should hold up better over the long haul than those in last year's phones, saying that the S8 and S8+ will retain 95% of their effective capacity after a full year of typical usage (the S7 retained just 80%). That's welcome news, because as we all know, battery life doesn't tend to get better as a phone ages. The idle drain on the S8+ wasn't particularly great in my experience, but that's because I had the always-on display enabled. Samsung estimated on the S7 that you'd drain under 1% of your battery per hour with the feature turned on, so I think those of you really looking to get every bit of battery bang for your buck possible will want to turn this off. It does have an effect. I also turned off Samsung's very annoying app "sleep" feature, which looks at apps that are using power in the background but that you don't use regularly and then forces them into an "sleep" state to prevent them from waking the phone. It's well-intentioned, I know, but if I want something like that, I tend to trust Greenify, and honestly, I'm generally OK with letting Android's Doze do its work. Finally, just as a note: all of my testing was done in the standard 1080p mode the phone ships in - I've not turned up the resolution to full QHD. Obviously, if you do this, your battery life will suffer as a result of the increased number of pixels which need to be rendered (apparently not - it's just performance). However, I really can't be sure just how big an effect this will have, and it's not a particularly easy thing to test outside of a highly controlled environment. Charging the S8 and S8+ is just the same as it's been for years with the Galaxy line of phones, using Samsung's Adaptive Fast Charge technology based on Qualcomm Quick Charge 2.0. The one change comes in the port, which is now a USB-C connector. Oh, and Samsung has made the charging bricks and cables black now, instead of white. It charges at the same speed all Samsung phones with Adaptive Fast Charge have over the years, and the charger still has a Type A USB port. Samsung says the retention of the older charging tech and Type A port is to make transitioning from legacy products easier for their customers, and it looks like the S8 will even include a microUSB to type C adapter tip in the box. When you sell as many smartphones to "normals" as Samsung, these are very valid considerations, and so while enthusiasts might be a bit miffed than Qualcomm Quick Charge 4.0 and USB Power Delivery aren't in tow here, it's not like the phones charge slowly. Samsung also still includes wireless charging, and it is releasing a new wireless fast charging pad which provides the same speed as the fast charging pad for the S7 did last year. This year, the pad has a rubbery, leather-texture surface and pops up to act as a phone stand, which is kind of cool. Wireless charging is available on all Galaxy S8 models, too - no worrying about regional variants here. Storage, wireless, and call quality The Galaxy S8 and S8+ come with as much storage as you'd like - as long as it's 64GB. There's only one storage tier being offered in the US (I wouldn't be surprised if China gets a 128GB model), but you can expand that with a microSD card. I really will hand it to Samsung for upping their base offering to 64GB - 32GB just doesn't cut it these days, and 128GB can seem a bit overkill. This T-Mobile variant I tested came with 53GB of that available to the user out of the box, which should be more than enough for most of us. Wireless performance on the phone has been excellent for me. Data speeds on T-Mobile have been great, and the Galaxy S8 and S8+ support a large number of advanced network technologies here in the US to ensure you're getting the most possible out of your carrier's network. Be it advanced LTE carrier aggregation, wireless MIMO, VoLTE, HD Voice, Wi-Fi calling, LTE-U - it's all here. You can thank Qualcomm's X16 LTE modem for most of this. A lot of things can be said of Samsung, but they rarely ever miss out on a chance to be a showcase for the carriers' newest features. T-Mobile, for example, says the S8 and S8+ will be the fastest-ever smartphones on its network thanks to 4x4 MIMO, carrier aggregation, and 256 QAM support. Wi-Fi performance on the S8+ has been great for me, and Bluetooth in my car has been flawless, providing strong reception and zero pairing issues (something that can't be said of certain phones starting with "P"). I've come to expect Samsung to get Bluetooth right over the years, and they still are. Bluetooth 5.0 support is on board courtesy of the Snapdragon 835 chipset, but no real consumer devices out there using the standard exist yet. But you can take advantage of some of the standard's increased power right now - for example, Samsung has introduced a new feature called dual audio that lets you stream to two pairs of Bluetooth headphones at once. That's pretty awesome. Audio and speakers The Snapdragon 835 features a newer revision of Qualcomm's Aqstic audio "codec" (basically, the DAC and headphone amplifier), and I do think some noticeable gains have been made here. For one, I feel output on the headphone jack is better - driving big, high-impedance headphones left me with more room on the volume slider than attempting to play the same tracks with my Pixel XL. I also might be hearing some improved bass response, but that could just be the extra "oomf" the new amplifier is providing. Quality itself is still excellent, and I really noticed no difference on that front between the 821 and 835. Annoyingly, Samsung's volume warning still won't let you exceed a certain threshold until you accept a warning dialogue saying you might blow out your ears. It is very annoying. I realize there are laws on the books about this in Europe, but why does this have to be in the firmware for every variant of the phone, and why does it have to tell you every time you plug in a set of headphones? That's certainly not the case with Apple or Google's phones here, but Samsung seems dogged in its resistance to this regional accommodation. Samsung doesn't seem to have really done much with its external speaker. It sounds decent, but the direction it fires and the peak output leave a fair bit to be desired. In the age of waterproofed smartphones with itty-bitty bezels, it's hard to see speakers being a major priority anymore. It's sad, but it's true. Camera I was a fan of the camera on the Galaxy S7 and S7 edge, though I do still have my critiques as they've aged: colors are exaggerated and processing can be overbearing. Samsung claims that while the camera in the S8 and S8+ is the same one found in last year's phones, they've done work on the processing side to increase image quality. What does that mean, exactly? For my eyeballs, it means less aggressive sharpening. As with last year's phones, the S8 is an incredibly capable camera in low light conditions. The f/1.7 lens hoovers up a surprising amount of light even in challenging conditions, and with a steady hand you can get some pretty crisp shots where other phones would just render an unpleasing mess of noise and blur. Even Google's Pixel is no match for the S7 in low light - the dual-pixel autofocus and aforementioned lens make a formidable duo in the dark. Photos shoot off fast and the camera launches quickly, though I had honestly hoped for some improvement in speed given the new Spectra ISP the Snapdragon 835 features. In fact, the Galaxy S8's camera still doesn't launch as consistently quickly as my Pixel XL's, especially when using the quick launch feature, where the Pixel XL is very noticeably faster on the draw. That's... not great. It's still quick to start up, but you'd think Samsung would be focusing on this kind of stuff in terms of trying to be the best. Previous Next When we get to the actual business of the photos, I think nearly everyone who buys this phone will be incredibly happy with how their snapshots turn out. They're vivid, crisp, and as I said, the results in challenging light are still as impressive today as they were last year. I definitely approve of Samsung's reduction in the amount of sharpening applied to photos - things just look more natural now. The colors are still a bit unrealistic at times, and Samsung's automatic HDR is nowhere near as impressive as Google's HDR+, meaning you'll still get blowouts in particularly high-contrast scenarios. But the camera is good. In terms of the app experience, Samsung has added Snapchat-like overlays and stickers (for joy), but aside from a new option to place a floating shutter button on the UI, the camera app is essentially unchanged from how it appears on the Galaxy S7's current Nougat build with Grace UX. That means you get a Pro mode with a few more shooting options (including RAW output), filters, slow motion, panorama, hyperlapse, and more. All in all, the camera experience on the S8 hasn't really changed much this year, and while I wouldn't call that a letdown, per se, I don't think Samsung had the best smartphone camera last year overall, and leaving it essentially unchanged for 2017 means it probably won't this year, either. Performance The version of the Galaxy S8+ I'm testing uses Qualcomm's Snapdragon 835 chipset, not the Samsung Exynos chip that many other markets around the world will get. If you want to know about the 835's capabilities on paper, we have an extensive post benchmarking its performance. In the real world, the Galaxy S8 and S8+ are the very first smartphones to utilize Qualcomm's new chip. How's that gone? Well, I am happy to report that the Galaxy S8+ I'm testing is very noticeably faster than an S7 edge with a fairly fresh Nougat install. It's a pretty stark difference. Has Samsung conquered the infamous lag its devices develop over longer periods of time? I can't answer that today, obviously, and Samsung really isn't interested in discussing it, either. As more reviewers and eventually consumers spend more time with the phone, we'll be able to better assess that issue. That said, out of the box, the Galaxy S8+ feels almost as quick as my Google Pixel XL. A little faster in some scenarios, too, but I would say the two phones offer reasonably comparable performance based on the week I had to really compare the two. The Pixel XL isn't what I'd call the fastest Android phone for raw speed (I'd say the OnePlus 3T wins there), but it's the consistency of its performance that has really impressed me in the last six months. If Samsung can keep even close to this level of performance on the Galaxy S8 six months from now, that'd be a huge boost for the user experience on its phones. That is, unless you really heat up the S8+. Between benchmark testing runs, I noticed the phone developed the very typical kind of lag I'd found on devices like the Galaxy S7 edge last year. The Pixel doesn't do this. The OnePlus 3T doesn't do this. Why are Samsung phones so aggressively throttling under thermal load? Still, the number of times I worked the phone hard enough in regular use for this to be an issue were negligible - as in, it really didn't happen at all outside the back-to-back benchmarking scenario. One performance asterisk I'd like to point out is that the Galaxy S8 and S8+ do give themselves something of an edge on phones like the G6 and Pixel XL inherently, because they run at 1080p resolution out of the box instead of the 1440p every other QHD phone does, but you really can't tell the difference 95% of the time. On the whole, I'm satisfied with how this phone performs. During the hands-on event, I was much more tepid, as I just didn't have the time to really get a feel, especially comparatively, for the overall smoothness and consistency of the experience. There are, however, some areas where I think Samsung could improve. The way the notification shade draws down feels a bit clunky (not slow, just weird), and sometimes the virtual navigation keys have a split-second delay on interaction. It's also definitely a bit easier to choke up the S8+ with manic opening and closing of apps than the Pixel XL - it does start to get a little overwhelmed when you really, really push it. I also think Google is doing a better job on touch latency, as sometimes the S8+ feels just a bit behind my fingers. As for benchmarks, you probably won't be surprised to learn Samsung's implementation of the Snapdragon 835 isn't as fast as Qualcomm's reference device.

Instead I'm going to devote this section to brief thoughts on thoughts I've had when using the phone - specific, relatively concise observations about what the Galaxy S8+ is like to use. The fingerprint scanner is too hard to reach on the S8+, misreads are common. You may smudge the camera lens when reaching for the scanner, meaning blurry photos if you're not an obsessive lens wiper like me. I tried to use the iris scanner, but it was even worse than the fingerprint sensor with my glasses, my hit rate was well under 20%. Unlike with the Pixel, Bluetooth performance in my car ('16 Mazda) was great - I didn't even need to take the phone out of my pocket. The S8+ is fairly easy to keep a grip on width-wise, but it is very tall, and pulling down on the notification bar one-handed just feels risky. The top area of my homescreen is basically a no man's land for the same reason. I can't say I actually care the phone renders in 1080p by default, you can't really tell. I didn't end up using the always-on home button feature at all, even though it is kind of neat. If I bought this phone, I'd turn off always-on display to keep the idle battery drain lower. While not the newest or fastest standard, Samsung's 15 watt fast charging still tops up the phone pretty quickly in my experience. On the launcher, the Samsung Pay quick-access peeking thing reduces the size of the touch targets for the nav keys. I switched the navigation key order to the traditional Android layout (back, home, recent apps) and haven't looked back. Samsung's new launcher looks alright but I went straight to Nova, in part to get my round icons back (yes, I have been Pixel indoctrinated). I don't know how anyone lives with the stock Samsung keyboard. Yikes. Even with all this extra vertical space, I still can't find a single compelling reason to split-screen apps on Android. Samsung still isn't allowing "OK Google" hotword recognition when the display is off (probably because Bixby). Software For the purpose of this review, much of my definition of "new" is going to rely on what is new versus a Galaxy S7 running Samsung's GraceUX update on Android 7.0. So with that in mind, let's get to it. What's new Navigation keys The biggest change, of course, is down at the bottom of the screen: virtual navigation keys! I'm not going to get caught up on how they look - I just care that they're there and they work. And you can change them to the proper back-home-recents order, which I did immediately upon setting up the phone. Choice feels good. You can also change the background color for the navbar if you're so inclined. The home button has a few extra tricks up its sleeve, too. It's always on - even if the always-on display mode is off and your screen isn't illuminated, there's a pressure sensitive area where the home button displays. Just press with some force (the amount of force can be adjusted in settings), and your phone will wake up just like you'd pressed a physical home button. You can see why rumors are swirling that Samsung wanted to integrate a fingerprint scanner with this feature - it would make complete sense. The home key will also respond to hard presses even when an app is overlaying the navbar. Honestly, I didn't end up using the hard press feature pretty much ever. You can also set it up to just display the lockscreen on a double-tap of the button. (Which is fine, but seems an inferior solution to tapping anywhere on the display to do a wake as LG, HTC, and other phones do.) Bixby *cracks knuckles.* OK, let's talk about Samsung's intelligent assistant... thing. Bixby exists in three incarnations on the Galaxy S8 at this time. First, there is Bixby Home (Google Now). Then, there is Bixby Reminders (which is, well, reminders). And then we have Bixby Vision (Google Goggles). We'll talk about each of them, I guess. Bixby's banner feature, voice controls, is not available at the time of this review, and will supposedly launch here in the US later this Spring. For now, then, all the Bixby button does is launch Bixby Home.    Bixby Home is the most involved of the three, so let's begin there. Bixby Home is a bit like someone took your Google Now feed and made it less useful. It displays recent photos you've taken, advertises themes on Samsung's Galaxy Apps store, suggests wallpapers, gives you unnecessarily large calendar event cards, displays random GIFs from giphy (why), gives you a list of your most frequently visited websites (if you use Samsung's browser), as well as your most frequently used apps. There's also weather, your step count (helpful), and news served from Flipboard (which you can remove entirely). Currently, Bixby home integrates with a few third-party apps, too. Spotify, Twitter, Uber, Giphy, Facebook, CNN, and Foursquare all can pipe in data to the Bixby Home app if they're installed on your device. Of note: Bixby Home by default can run from your lockscreen, though Samsung does disable cards that might contain personally identifying information like your contacts or calendar. Bixby Home does look kind of nice, so there's that, but I just don't see anybody using this. Google Now is helpful for the deep insights it has about your habits and interests based on the fact that Google knows an insanely creepy amount about what you do on the internet. Samsung will probably never be able to get that deep. Then, we've got Bixby Reminders. Bixby Reminders is exactly what it sounds like: you can set a reminder to do something, including based on a time or location. There are roughly, I don't know, a billion apps and services out there that do this much more robustly and with far more powerful features. I don't see any reason to care about Bixby Reminders unless you're a big fan of Bixby Home, which is where you will be able to find said Bixby Reminders. Finally, there's Bixby Vision. You use it by opening the camera app and pressing the Bixby Vision button. Right now, Bixby Vision can identify wine. I tried a bottle, it didn't work. Bixby Vision can also identify text for translation. That's kind of nice. Bixby Vision can identify objects. I showed it a Galaxy S7. It gave me results for iPads. And it can read QR codes, because it's 2017 and we're still using those. So, yes, it really is just Google Goggles but kind of different (and worse?). You can probably safely ignore Bixby for now, but maybe voice commands will make it actually somewhat useful when they do arrive. Try not to hit the button accidentally, though - I'm doing it all the time and it's getting kind of annoying. Snap window Snap windows is an interesting attempt by Samsung to make Android's splitscreen functionality suck less when you're using it to watch video. Let's say you're watching something in YouTube but you also want to keep texting someone without interrupting your video. You could use Android's built-in splitscreening to do this, but every time you pop out the keyboard in the chat app, your video is going to get pushed around and interrupted and reload constantly. It's a bad experience, and kind of shows just what a sorry state multitasking really still is in on the platform.    Snap window is a band-aid, of sorts, on that problem. With your video player open and the video in view (in portrait mode), open the multitasking UI and the card for the video app should have a third icon to the left of the splitscreen button. Hit that, and you're given a crop interface. Move the rectangle over the area where the video is playing, adjust the size if necessary, and hit "done." At this point, the video will "pin" to the top of the screen, and the lower part of the interface becomes the app switcher. Pick an app, and you're off and running - the video won't move at all even if you pop out the keyboard, and plays back smoothly. I have no idea how this really works, but Samsung clearly understood that video was a pain point in the Android splitscreen experience, and this makes it much better. I can't say I'll use it, but given all that vertical screen space on the S8+, I'm sure someone wants to know about this. Snap window works with any app, of course, but video is the most obvious application. Dual audio Thanks to Bluetooth 5.0, the Galaxy S8 can transmit the same audio to two pairs of Bluetooth audio devices at once. This could be great for watching movies or listening to music on a plane together, for example. I tested it, and it works. Samsung does note that because you only get one volume slider to adjust on the phone, the output level to each connected Bluetooth device will probably vary, and you'll need to adjust the device volume for individual control. Still, it's pretty cool. Separate app sound This is another one I found digging around in Samsung's labyrinthine settings menu: a new feature called separate app sound. I know, this sounds boring, but hold on - it may actually solve a problem that's been bugging you for years. Streaming music over Bluetooth is convenient, but it does tend to come with a catch: your device can't play any other media audio when you're streaming music, because that'll pause the player app. So if you want to play a game or watch a video silently on your phone while you're streaming tunes to a Bluetooth speaker or headphones, you can't - there's only one media channel. This fixes that. Once separate app sound is enabled, you can select one app and make it the exclusive media audio provider to a connected Bluetooth device. So, if you want to make sure Play Music is coming through your Bluetooth speaker, pick the Play Music app and select the Bluetooth device, and only that app will be allowed to send media audio to that speaker while this setting is enabled. (Notification audio, unfortunately, is not blocked - that will still come through.) But, now you can open up YouTube, a game, or browse the web on phone while Play Music is going without worrying about pausing your Bluetooth stream, as all other media audio will play directly through the device speaker instead. This is a pretty decent idea. Other changes I've got some smaller features and changes I discovered, and I'll list them out here. Fingerprint scanner can be set to pull down the notification shade and, from the home screen, to launch Samsung Pay by swiping up. Face unlock mode Always-on display mode has some very slight aesthetic tweaks. That's really it. The software changes versus the current GraceUX OS on the GS7 and S7 edge are pretty minor. General UI (launcher, notifications, lockscreen, navigation keys) The notification tray is essentially unchanged from the current version of Samsung's skin running on a Galaxy S7, though the launcher is all-new version of TouchWiz Home that uses a swipe-up (or down, actually) app drawer a la Pixel. Samsung has also implemented some kind of ape on launcher shortcuts, but they're not really launcher shortcuts - they're just a bunch of actions you can take on the icon. For example, you can multi-select icons in the launcher, remove a shortcut, sleep an app, uninstall it, or go to the info screen. It's kind of handy, really, but I'm not sure it could easily coexist with Android's app shortcuts - the list of items would get really long. In lieu of Google Now, the TouchWiz launcher has a pane for Bixby home to the left of the first homescreen. Yay.    Like me, you're probably going to toss off that stock launcher almost immediately, so I won't dive in too deep. It seems like a fine launcher as OEM launchers go, but if you want any kind of customization, you've still got to go third party. The recent apps menu is the same as you'll find on any up to date S7, and the lockscreen has seen a slight visual refresh, though still offers the same shortcuts for the dialer, Samsung Pay, and the camera app. Of note: Samsung takes a more conservative approach with whether or not it will stretch apps into "full-screen" mode on this new, longer display. There's an area in the settings menu where you can force toggle apps to display in the full UI space, as I've noticed many, even some Google apps, are not set to by default. I forced this on for all my apps and haven't had any issues, but your mileage may vary. Software: Opinion I really don't mind GraceUX. Samsung doesn't mess with stock Android too much these days from a strictly functional perspective. I don't like that I have to disable some things like Samsung's app sleeping, touch sounds, or navigation button order - but here's the thing: I can. There are very few things which I cannot change about the software experience on the Galaxy S8 that are genuine annoyances. Don't like the launcher? Throw on a new one. Don't care for Bixby? Ignore it. Almost every potential software negative on this phone is either easily replaced or simply kept out of sight and out of mind.    Throw on your own launcher, set up Samsung Pay, and try to ignore that you'll probably be seeing "7.0" on this screen for a while - that's my advice. Meanwhile, Samsung adds genuinely useful features like Samsung Pay, screen modes, its dual audio Bluetooth feature, game modes, fingerprint scanner gestures, face recognition, a system-level audio EQ, tons of various configuration options, and more all packaged in what is probably the most technologically advanced smartphone on sale right now. That's not small potatoes. The one sticking point for me, though, is the Android version. The Galaxy S8 ships with Android 7.0, already a version and change behind. Samsung seems to have no interest in changing its approach to platform updates, and that's disappointing. I guess we'll see how they handle things with the S8 and S8+, but I don't have my hopes up. Additionally, while performance is decent out of the gate, I really think we should be demanding more. "Almost as good as the Pixel" is not huge praise considering this phone runs a next-generation chipset and renders the OS at a fraction the resolution a Pixel does. These aren't small concerns for the enthusiast set, but I don't think they're at all fatal to the phones. They're just worth considering. Value In essence, the Galaxy S8 and S8+ retail for $750 and $850, respectively, here in the US. That's a chunk of change more than an LG G6, though that phone does only come with 32GB of storage and features an older chipset. I think that considering the advanced display, processor, and level of quality Samsung is delivering, the prices are totally justifiable. Now, that doesn't mean they're not expensive phones - they are. Really, really expensive phones. But the standard S8 to me is more the competitor to the G6 and Pixel XL, while the S8+ sort of stands on its own as a direct challenge to the iPhone 7 Plus. Many people may not find the size of the S8+ very practical - it really is quite tall. Samsung phones also mean a glut of accessory choices for things like cases, full compatibility with any US carrier (including advanced network features), and more attention from 3rd-party developers in terms of ensuring apps run as they should. These aren't trivial things, even if they may not often go into the traditional smartphone value assessment. Is there nearly $300 more hardware in a Galaxy S8 than a OnePlus 3T? Of course not. But that's not really the question anyone is seriously asking. I think Samsung is charging a pretty penny for the S8 and S8+, but I also think they're doing more to convince the average consumer than, say, Google, that the price of admission is actually worth it. Conclusion The Galaxy S8 and S8+ are great smartphones, I have no doubt of this. Are they great smartphones for everyone? That's a question that, as an Android enthusiast myself, I have a harder time sounding decisive answering. I really like the Infinity Display. I like the very good battery life. I don't mind GraceUX - it's fine! I like the cameras, I like the quality of the phone itself, and I like the new software navigation keys. I have a harder time accepting the update situation and the already-slightly-shaky performance. These things give me genuine pause. But if they don't concern you - and they may well not - it's hard to find truly major faults with these phones. Samsung has done an excellent job building upon and refining the formula that it... built upon and refined with the S7 and S7 edge. The S8+ is probably a little big for most people, but I like that Samsung is offering a "real" big phone in its mainstream lineup. And if you don't want a "big" phone, the standard S8 really is very manageable. Samsung has built two excellent smartphones with the S8 and S8+. We're awarding both the S8 and S8+ our editor's choice "Most Wanted" accolade as well. Whether or not that gets you excited really comes down to what you value in a phone. For me? I'm still pretty happy with my Pixel XL. But if I was shopping today, I'd give the S8, or the S8+, a long, hard look. Tags galaxy 8 review galaxy s8 review subscribe ...

David Ruddock Can you tell I was in a bit of time crunch? haha. Thanks again. Pete Smith Its the first GS8 review I came across so got my eyeballs, your effort was worth it! Marty Just for interest since you used Geekbench, my Honor 8 got this score. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/4b179b912ffc406ee06b6dff18a2017929f27362c4f2d6b7945c1341904cf980.png Mark Whelan my Mate 9 scored 1859 single core 6474 multi-core I still think the battery life is going to be just average on these new Samsung phones on the Snapdragon chipset...I get a solid 36 hours out of my phone with 8 hrs screen time. S8+ will get 5 hours most likely on a 15 hr day...and badly needing the charger.... What's the point of a QHD screen if you ship it running 1080p? Marty My opinion is that Huawei's going to displace Samsung as the top Android OEM since they are making such good phones. iKon Agreed, Huawei are slowly climbing up, they already in top 3 and it won't take long to get past apple. Anon probably in just a year or 2 to overtake Apple. It will still take quite a while to displace Samsung. 4 years? Marty If Sammy keeps languishing with their mobile division, it won't take 4 years. Samsung's software, while brimming with features, just isn't good. The only software Sammy has put out that's above and beyond anything else in its class is an app: Samsung Internet Beta. Dubs816 lmaoooooo dickchao Yeah these guys are delusional lol Marty By the way, the resolution is selectable. I'm pretty sure the S8 wouldn't be locked to FHD. Steve McQueen Love my Mate 9. Getting 8-9 hours of SOT is pretty nice. And I love not having to worry about battery life even during a 20 hour day. Stu Would you recommend this phone? I'm thinking of grabbing it the next time it's on sale. Marty Absolutely. It's one of the best phones I've ever owned. It's gorgeous, superbly made, feels good in the hand and is probably the fastest phone I've used. The fingerprint scanner is amazingly quick. The phone works so well too. If you don't mind an Android phone more similar to an iPhone, this is it. The system pretty much looks more like an iPhone than any Android. But it doesn't lack features like an iPhone would. My opinion why the Honor 8 hasn't received the fanfare it deserves has to do with religious hatred of Apple and the iPhone by Android enthusiasts. They can be quite irrational. Anything that even hints of iOS is likely to be shunned no matter how good the device is. I got the 64GB blue one and have been smiling since. And get a Spigen case for it if you get one. The Spigen really enhances the beauty of the Honor 8 while protecting it. m477 I like iOS. I really don't like cheap copies of it, and some of the common chinese-OEM software solutions, like a pre-installed, intrusive cleaner. I hate bullshit like that. Marty I wouldn't call EMUI on the Honor 8 a cheap copy of iOS. But it sounds like you have a gripe against the Honor 8. m477 I'm just calling EMUI what it is. It's clearly meant to mimic iOS, and it has some very questionable design choices. I have nothing against Huawei's hardware, I own a P9 lite. Marty Yeah, well I don't see a problem with it. It isn't iOS. It definitely runs quick. Smoothest, fastest Android yet. m477 My problem it's that I find it ugly to look at, compared to other interface, and I really don't like that it tries so hard to mimic iOS. To each their own. Marty Like how Samsung tries so hard to copy the iPhone. But, that's how it goes... Marty You know something? I used to listen to people like you about the Honor 8 before I finally decided to do an impulse buy and get one. Things that people like you say kept me from taking a chance on it. I'm glad I did an impulse buy because it turns out to be one of the best phones I've ever owned. It isn't nearly like what people like you say about it. I've already said that Android enthusiasts raise objection to the Honor 8 for whatever reasons, but the general public will love this device because it is that good. All people have to do is disregard the "Android enthusiast" rhetoric about it and give it a go. D13H4RD2L1V3 EMUI 5 is pretty good. Tried it on a Mate 9 along with its Pro variant and it does zip past screens without effort. Sure, its aesthetics are questionable but it is much improved. m477 Good for you. I'm not an Android enthusiast as much as a tech enthusiast. My daily driver is an iPhone, and I've tried most of the various Android UIs (even ColorOS and MIUI). In my opinion EMUI design wise is one of the most derivative. I don't like the fact that is a copy mostly because it seems to be screaming "I want to be an iPhone but I'm not". It got much better with the fifth version, and it will not get in your way (most of the time, at least). It's obviously still Android under the hood. Most Huawei phones are overall good, but you can't deny that software design is not their forte. A normal user will be fine with that. I personally just don't like copycats. Marty Comparing EMUI to Touchwiz, I'd say Huawei is an expert on software. Meaning EMUI is way better than Samsung's junky software. My Honor 8...the software experience...feels refined and high quality compared to many other Android systems. If anyone wants the truth about it, just give an Honor 8 a try. Update it to EMUI 5/Android 7 and use it daily. It's impressive. This is coming from someone who has a great many phones and has experienced many more. I can list all the phones I've owned and have used and this Honor 8 is the finest of them. m477 The hate on Touchwiz/GraceUX is a little more than a meme right now. Design wise it's not that bad, actually. Every modern, highly specced phone is a good phone (with a few exceptions), and will be "impressive" in daily usage. It's mostly a matter of preference. Marty Heh...so if someone who has a significant number of modern devices sees one of them stand out as impressive, it means nothing? Like you say, "to each, their own". Michaels_28 EMUI = Spyware. I tossed out my Honor 8. It was a good phone for the price I paid ($350 with a promo) but if I had to do it again I would avoid it. Having said that, the reason why Huawei is not selling their affordable phones like hotcakes in the U.S. is not because of irrational hatred. It's because of 1) national security interest, and 2) patents. If you remember the length Apple went after Samsung because of "rectangles with rounded corners," then you should be able to picture the legal barrier Huawei (or anyone really) is facing. Marty If the government was concerned about national security, Obama would never have been president. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I like MIUI. It's very iPhoneish. m477 If you can stand EMUI, which is a cheap copy of the iPhone's interface, and some of the crappy software solutions, it's a good phone. Cakefish Galaxy S7 w/Exynos 8890 https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/d012918ef89a330af9de9ee732fbd0c60a69cebc2441f666b62a620328a3c72c.png MJ "...already-slightly-shaky performance." LOL Someday Samsung, someday. I really like look of the phone but the fingerprint scanner location (and shape) is really tragic and a no go. Toss3 Pretty sure that's just the 835 slowing things down, as the exynos version I tried was buttery smooth (smoother than my tweaked exynos S7). There are always going to be some slowdowns, but in the case of the S-series most of it can be linked back to the Snapdragon SoCs. David Ruddock Plenty of OEMs make Snapdragon chips run perfectly smooth. It says far more about Samsung than it does Qualcomm. Toss3 Didn't mean to make it sound like there is anything wrong with Snapdragon SoCs; they just aren't a priority over at Samsung and if you want a smooth experience, you need to get the international version. Samsung is definitely to blame, but they do offer an alternative and it's always better to let people know that the Exynos version is the one to get. MJ The international version is not really an option in the US for most people. Warranty, Samsung Pay (that fixed yet?), and some type of payment plan are all big things. ericshmerick No wifi calling, no gogo pass functionality (on T-Mo). whispy_snippet "if you want a smooth experience, you need to get the international version" ...you need to get a different phone all together. MJ What? No... tu3218 Just use google smart Lock. I rarely need to use my fingerprint scanner on my S7 edge because of this. MJ I rarely use my phone at home and don't have a smartwatch so Smart Lock is of limited use to me. The fingerprint scanner is the best option for me and I am not buying the S8 so it doesn't really matter. tu3218 On body detection...this doesn't just apply to the s8. It's any phone. Just in case you were unaware of that feature. I know I always forget about that one. S8 does the best of everything besides the fingerprint scanner. Very easy to look over. m477 Is not easy to look over. Even budget phones have nailed the fingerprint reader. It's unacceptable that it sucks on a flagship. tu3218 I agree. Last minute terrible decision. It helps knowing that. Doesn't make it right though. TBD how bad it is when I get my s8. Smart Lock helps though. Rick Atherton it might just be me but every phone I've used the on body detection the phone always does stuff in my pocket so i always turn it off Drakenoid I use Gravity Screen instead of that, works far better. Scott It sucks they couldn't figure out how to put in under the display as they clearly wished they could. I just hope Apple has the same issue, or Samsung will have some serious egg on their face come iPhone time. MJ While the under the display fingerprint scanner would be cool tech I am not sure about having a permanent fingerprint smudge on my screen. LOL whispy_snippet A fingerprint sensor under the display makes perfect sense. I can't wait until every phone can do it well. MJ A fingerprint sensor under the display would be cool but NOT any more practical (I would argue LESS practical) than a sensor on the back (and less costly to implement). whispy_snippet Having owned a Pixel since launch I'd have to say I disagree. I love my phone. I think the Pixel is such a well rounded experience. But the one area I really think could be better is the fingerprint sensor placement. Sure, it's great when it's in my hand. But it's almost always on a desk in front of me - just like right now. If I want to quickly check something, I need to pick it up to use the fingerprint sensor or leave it on the table and swipe in my pattern. Sucky. If the fingerprint sensor was on the front this issue would be eliminated immediately. I feel like putting fingerprint sensors on the back is just a way of being different to Apple for different's sake - and I guess I can sorta understand this given Apple kicks up such a huge song and dance the moment anyone tries to do anything coming close to their approach. But fuck it. Just put it on the front and fight them I say. MJ A Pixel XL owner since launch myself. The fingerprint sensor is quick and accurate and my finger slides into place naturally. What is there not to like? I never could understand "the phone on the desk argument". Incoming text and call information shows right up on the lock screen. I can just double tab and put in my pin if really need to do interact but I would pick it up and use the fingerprint scanner just like any other time I use my phone. I mostly use my phone when on the go anyway which means it is in my pocket and a rear sensor works much better (and natural) than the front sensor on my former HTC 10 ever did. "I feel like putting fingerprint sensors on the back is just a way of being different to Apple for different's sake...". Huh? No... Again, I would argue a sensor on back just makes more sense and in the case of Google they have always used on-screen buttons so a single fingerprint reader on the front would just look stupid (aka see Moto) and also the Nexus 6P/5X had front facing speakers so the sensor had to go on the back. whispy_snippet The thing is, double tap to wake doesn't work reliably. It works maybe 75% of the time. Not bad, but when it lets you down it grates. In fact the same goes for Google's screen off voice unlock - it works maybe 60% of the time and this REALLY annoys me... but I digress. The fingerprint scanner on the back is great when it's in your hand but annoying when it's on a desk. A fingerprint scanner on the front is good in your hand and good on a desk. Ultimately, I think I'd prefer a consistently good user experience. I think a fingerprint sensor behind the display will be the end goal for every phone maker. In a couple of years I reckon everyone will be doing it. Bryan Breguet Fingerprint sensor on the back makes no sense to me and is an automatic dealbreaker. I truly hate it. Also, really, you don't understand the argument of when the phone is on your desk? Surely you are trolling. MJ I think people who think they can't use their phone because it's sitting on a desk and it has rear fingerprint scanner are trolling. Alejandro You can double tap the screen to read the notifications...No need to unlock the phone with the fingerprint sensor. Bryan Breguet You can double tap to read the notification, not the full email or even picture or whatever. Are you guys really that thick that you are trying to use this argument? You'll ultimately need to unlock the phone and therefore it means you won't use the fingerprint almost half the time. Scott You mean on your touchscreen? MJ Yes. whispy_snippet On the one hand, yes. I expect Apple will get the fingerprint scanner under the display right for their upcoming flagship. On the other hand if Apple comes out with a minimal bezel, curved edge display it's going to be a special moment for Samsung. Finally, Samsung will be able to say outright "You copied US, Apple" and they'll be right. m477 You hope that a competing product has some issue and the advanced technology that everyone want's will not be ready, so Samsung's sells won't be hindered? Do you own Samsung stocks or something? Scott Hell yeah I want the iPhone to faceplant. enoch861 I've switched my S7 Edge between UHD and HD and I've never really noticed a battery life difference between the two. My battery has been overall atrocious for some reason, but I can't find the perpetrator. Overall I'm not sure if I'll be upgrading even though the S8+ looks quite attractive. illregal Samsung cheap garbage mainstream phones for the followers TechGuy22 LOL illregal funny because it's true. 2kool4skool ...that will sell millions. illregal yeah, there are walmarts all over the place as well. Quantity sold is not a factor of quality. 2kool4skool Then what is the factor of quality in this case? Amount of raging fanboys in tech forums? Flagships cost a lot these days. The fact that tens of millions of people trust their hard earned money with Samsung devices might say something about its quality. illregal It actually says something about their inability to think for themselves. Their inability to know what the difference between devices is in the first place. Most people call android devices droids. or think samsung is the only company that even makes android devices. You're giving people to much credit. They are much more dumb than you assume. Plus they saw 4 commercials for samsung crap during their episode of dancing with the stars, so it has to be good right!?? 2kool4skool And how do you think Samsung able to get all over the place in the first place? Samsung mobile division also start with with a humble beginning like every other android oem company. Htc arguably was a bigger player in early android days. But Samsung has consistently able to give what people want until today, that's why it keeps growing and expanding and now you can see 4 commercial about it during episodes of dancing with the stars. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ It's called capitalism. And it works most of the time. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yes quantity is an indicator of quality. McDonald's doesn't make the best quality food, but they sell the most because it's the best and most consistent quality fast food. I say that as someone who would never eat there, too. You don't compare McDonald's to Ruth's Chris, because they're not in the same category. The S8 and S8+ will sell gazillions because they're the best quality flagship phones. illregal You just contradicted yourself. They will sell gazillions because they are all over the place, and people are bombarded with ads, and don't know any better. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Debating with you is a waste of time, but McDonald's is all over the place because people like the food. If nobody liked it, they couldn't open so many locations. Consumers love Samsung phones. Deal. illregal I know what people love.. Problem is I have to support their poor choices. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Well, I don't have to support your idiotic comments. You're blocked now. Suicide_Note Cheap? Nope. Garbage? Nope. Mainstream? Yes, but that's what happens when you sell tens of millions of devices. XDAMM Excuse me while I enjoy my gorgeously designed phone with the best display and top tier cameras, performance and battery life. Samsung's S series are indeed mainstream but they're not cheap and they are definitely not garbage. Their software could always improve and they could release major Android versions faster but their hardware game is just too strong and at least their software is usually stable and reliable (unlike previous Nexus phones and the Pixel which continue to be plagued by Bluetooth issues even months after release). I'd love having a consistent 60fps UI like the Pixel does but I won't sacrifice other software additions and considerably better hardware just for smoothness. illregal sweet pink display yo. sweet top tier, meaning not as good as some cameras yo. Performance, yo.. Enjoy your stutters. and average battery life. Cat Astrophy Enjoy your pocket explosive XDAMM Really? That was funny and relevant when the Note 7 was confirmed of having that issue but not anymore. If you think about it every battery powered device is a potential hazard but we don't usually worry about our Bluetooth headphones or laptops exploding even though that happens often. A few S8 will likely combust because statistically speaking it's nearly impossible to make a perfect phone, but its quite unlikely for that to become a widespread issue again. Jumanji! Be honest - do you work for Saygus? Middlefinger Compared to who? Google? Its phones are total junk, riddled with hardware and software faults, and over priced. TechGuy22 i'm buying S8+ used probably the exynos version so i can put AOSP on it Bewear That would have been considered a crazy idea some years ago. Time sure changes everything! 2kool4skool Always go with exynos version. Smother and more battery life. The only drawback is a bit weaker gpu than SD version, but meh, we're not going to play crysis on it anyway. TechGuy22 yeah i can't be with a locked down phone. Tech Writer The GPU is more powerful on exynos this time around. Toss3 "I would seriously worry about breaking this phone if I bought it. There is so much glass - Samsung phones essentially require cases." - Not sure I agree as the glass is pretty tough if the S7/S7 Edge are anything to go by. Only thing I didn't like about the S8 is the curvature on the front glass, as it is just too much and makes the display look distorted. Middlefinger I agree, plus the glass can be changed, whereas a metal unibody cant (as easily) and dents/ scratches much more easily. Ammar I just cannot decide between this and the Pixel XL. S8 is just a sultry, almost exotic looking device. But despite what the reviews will say, I doubt the performance and battery will be as consistent. jonathan If you want consistent performance and timely updates go for the pixel or wait for the next pixel, if you want a sexy device go with the S8. Me myself I always prefer the device with consitant performance and timely updates XDAMM I care more about a fast and responsive UI, fast app opening and switching and good gaming performance than 60FPS UI. Because of this, the better display, cameras, ingress protection rating, iris scanner, wireless charging and 64GB of (faster) storage by default there is just no comparison and I'll get the S8. The Pixel is an interesting proposition but it's not sold officially in my country and they have so many Bluetooth and battery related issues they're just not worth the asking price and trouble IMO. Rod http://i.imgur.com/kHx9ayV.gif http://i.imgur.com/qa22ZNQ.gif P. Sherman Bluetooth on Pixels are damn near UNUSABLE since launch. The fingerprint reader was rendered UNUSABLE in 7.1.2. Lags here and there are infinitely more acceptable than hardware failures, which apparently the Pixel is very good at. Rod I don't think inconsistent performance is acceptable on a > 720 bucks device. P. Sherman But it's still better than NON-PERFORMANCE. 2kool4skool The only thing I don't like from this otherwise great devices is the extra "Bixby" button. It kinda mess up the seamlessness of the device a little bit. But I don't think it's would be a significant upgrade from s7 edge, but I really like where Samsung is heading with these new devices, though. I'll wait for the next iteration, if the rumors are true, next galaxy s would probably feature an under-screen fingerprint scanner. It would make the device evn more seamless, they could get rid the home button entirely. One could only hope. Ome Dries Are the screenshots on the S8 square? That means it renders pixels the display can't even show, imagine how much performance & battery life they could've gained 2kool4skool Considering it renders 4262400 pixels by default, I don't think few pixels on the corners would make that much of a difference. create812 Stock Android or bust. Also, what's the deal with Project Fi? Can any phone with the proper radios take advantage of a Project Fi SIM, or does Goog only allow "approved" phones? Marty Only Nexii and the Pixels. create812 I think I saw a video early in the Project Fi days of a Samsung phone having a Fi SIM in it, and it partially worked (only worked with one of the carriers). I'm wondering what the current status of this is. Can someone pop a Fi SIM into their S8 and figure out what happens? Max Apparently we can also include now Nokia phones. raazman Can't wait to see what they're gonna do. OligarchyAmbulance Nokias are supposed to work on Fi? Max Not at the moment, but the rumor mill is that they want to be "the next Nexus" so depending on their relationship with Google that could be the case in the future. Just a guess based on rumors so take it with a grain of salt. FeelThePoveR Or OnePlus. (Or custom roms in my case) Roy No. OnePlus tow don't got any nougat Defenestratus What is stock android these days? I don't even know. EvilHowl AOSP Eric Abreu You can use a Project Fi sim card with other phones, but you'll only have access to the T-Mobile network. I think that you'll also need to activate the sim card on a Nexus or Pixel device before moving it to a non-Google device 2kool4skool "Stock Android or bust." You're missing out so many great phones out there. raazman What's so great about them? Mike Limited bezels is a good start. Realistically, to keep this short it would be more what's so great about stock phones: 1. Fast Updates 2. Quicker UI 3. ........ That's about it. raazman Quicker UI? I beg to differ. Fast updates? Um what? Not even remotely close. Mike You need to read the entire comment to get what I'm saying. Unless you are, in fact, saying that Samsung's phones will get quicker updates than Pixel phones. raazman Oh, oops. I replied to 2kool4skool. I already know Google's Nexus Pixels are better in both regards. Mike And that's also where it ends in terms of what does stock offer over other Android phones. raazman Opinions I guess, because I differ on that stance. Mike Other than the two things I named, name something stock Android does better than a phone Samsung/LG released. FeelThePoveR Customizability which is the main point of android I guess. Middlefinger Whos updates? Googles or Samsungs? Recent events should tell you that rushing to install whatever Google pushes out isnt always a good thing. 2kool4skool They don't have endless problems like pixel and pixel xl for a start. raazman Ummm...you sure buddy? LG? Samsung TouchWiz? Which phones are we talking about here? And my Pixel XL has not had a problem yet. So I'm not convinced. Mike Ah, the good old "My ____ is working fine so obviously there's no issues at all". Hearing this always makes me appreciate what we've become. raazman I just commented saying I've seen this trend since the S3 among friends and family, calm down. Mike "And my Pixel XL has not had a problem yet. So I'm not convinced." Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Nobody who owns a Pixel XL has a problem with it. Except those who do. 2kool4skool I don't know man, I tend to believe tech sites like this more than the trend among your friends and family. And this site talks a lot about pixel problems. The last one was 2 days ago about some pixels losing fingerprint scanner functionality after latest update, look it up. raazman How about note 7 explosions? TouchWiz lag? And now it seems like the S8 screen has color issues. 2kool4skool Here we go again with "my phone might have a lot of problems, but at least it doesn't explode" argument. Note 7 is dead, and people get their money back, so it literally cost people 0$. How much pixel cost? 800$? Stop comparing 0$ phone to 800$ one. raazman Haha you're delusional if you think the galaxies don't have issues. 2kool4skool I never think or said that. All phones have issues including galaxies. But it's the first time I see devices (pixel and pixel xl) with so much problems that continously popped up and being featured on Android sites for almost every two weeks. Roy Because everybody want to hear about Pixel so even it's a little bunch of users let's make a headlight. Rod Actually, many people lost $ due to cases and other accessories not being refunded. Middlefinger Never seem this mythical lag, the Note was bad, but a one off, this screen colour seems like a first batch issue like all devices have. The Pixel is just riddled with faults even the newest batch. Remember the N5 was redesigned because the first run was so poor, the N7 had terrible screen quality problems and slow NAND, HTCs have had multiple camera issues, the iPhone also had screen issues, Sony had battery issues. Its common. Rod How about this one? http://i.imgur.com/kHx9ayV.gif Middlefinger Right, first release software (or even pre-release). Ive seen just as bad on a Nexus at release, if not worse. My Samsungs have never exhibited anything like that. Rod I've had 3 Nexus, and never saw anything like that either. Middlefinger Ive had 5, all had some lag, I returned 2 because they were poor quality. Roy Not really he was talking also about 6p and shocking it's smooth as ever. Most of the users don't have this problems. Middlefinger Samsung sell hundreds of millions of phones, Google has sold about 12 Pixels.. OK an exaggeration, but the point remains. If you sell more, a LOT LOT more, then problems seem more common, but as a percentage they arent. 2kool4skool And out of 12 pixels sold, 9 have problems. 9/12, needs more bugs. - IGN Rashad Actually, 9/12=.75 7.5 = Good -IGN Roy Not really. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Correction: HTC has shipped about 2 million Pixels and Pixel XLs since launch 6 months ago. Samsung has 20 million S8/S8+ phones ready for launch. Middlefinger and will sell more than 2 million in the first day. Nexus/pixel sales have always been poor, just like the product. Roy My 6p also no problem. illregal Samsungs have more hardware and software issues than everyone else combined. raazman Since the S3, yes this is what I've personally seen among friends and family. 2kool4skool Lol, who are we kidding here? You can find bunch of articles about pixel problems on this site. Last article I read was 2 days ago about some pixels lost ability to set up fingerprint scanner after latest update. Roy Haha but it isn't true my 6p rocking with a great fingerprint scanner. Middlefinger I think the Pixel has that crown now. I have had zero problems with any of my Samsungs, ive returned all my Nexus devices due to faults and poor quality. create812 I know, but stock Android, fast updates, and compatibility with Fi are my top priorities. Roy Not really. Not looking for junk. Defenestratus Picking up my S8+ on Friday - despite Bixby stupidity. I'm praying that the community figures out how to disable it. I currently have a Nexus 6P that constantly infuriates me. The pixel was not a value proposition that I was convinced was worth it - and I doubt the Pixel 2 will be either if they stick with the old, tired form factors and tiny screen sizes. So S8+ is what I'm left with. We'll see if it leads to user angst or not. I'm trying my best to be optimistic. Jay If it can be disabled by a package disabler, I'll be happy. I think. catalysto Early rumors say Pixel 2 will have a much smaller bezel like the other phones coming out this generation. I wouldn't make any assumptions yet. 2kool4skool If Google wanted smaller bezel for their pixel 2, they gonna need to pick some company other than Htc to do their devices. Htc simply can't manufacture a phone with small bezel or water resistant because their manufacturing process is outdated. catalysto Who says Google won't do that? 2kool4skool I never said, that. In fact, I think It would be cool if they go with Motorola this year. illregal their manufacturing process isn't outdated. They just care. They mill out unibody designs from a solid block. Which takes time and effort. Unlike samsung, who just stamps out garbage, quantity quantity quantity. 2kool4skool Have you seen their latest device, htc u? It's enormous in size, but only has 3000mah battery. It's thick af, yet it still has a very protuding camera. It doesn't even have audio jack, water resistance, and wireless charging yet yet it still cost an arm and leg. If that's what you mean by care, I can't imagine how much shittier their device would be if they made if without care. Jay There might be a few more compromises here than I originally thought but it's too late to cancel my pre-order. Now I don't know whether I should even bother. 😕 Thanks for this uncertainty now, David. (Partially kidding..) 4Ui812 I see the red tint in most pics. AC has a story about that problem with some phones in Korea . Is the bootloader locked down like with the S7E ? http://www.androidauthority.com/galaxy-s8-displays-red-discoloration-764692/ https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2550b567c5a3bd243534cc66e251d0edbb770bd373e83a7961b5012e2e49c482.jpg Marty Holy shit! The HTC S8. 2kool4skool Probably just some devices with miscalibrated screen, for now can be solved by lowering red pixel intensity in setting. But they'll probably fix it via OTA later. Samsung introduced new screen calibration setting on nougat, you can set the intensity of each of RGB pixels to meet your desired color balance. Here's setting screenshot on my s7 edge. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/78c23a79995e1f76d6daf742ac05cc0f8893b2871459eeb4cdfec41c6eef2872.png illregal You can't fix poor screen quality with an OTA. If you lower a setting to calibrate a device via an update. The ones without the issue will then be more off. It's not a matter of adjustments, its a matter of poor qc and not yielding consistent products. 2kool4skool How it's "poor screen quality"? It's not hardware problem. Just some minor adjustments via OTA, and it will be fixed. If you're asking how they're gonna fix it without ruining other devices, the answer is the same way Google fixes pixels with Bluetooth problem without ruining the ones that's function just fine. It's software problem, they're gonna figure something out. FeelThePoveR It may as well be a hardware problem, because why couldn't it be? 2kool4skool I highly doubt that, because as I said before the problem can simply be solved by lowering red pixel intensity in setting. Galaxy s screens has always feature calibration setting as a feature, probably it's just some sloppy written code messing up with the setting. And if that's the case, it would be fixable via OTA. Take my answer with a grain of salt, though. Because we still need confirmation from Samsung if that's indeed the case. This is merely the logical answer I can think of for this problem. catalysto Is calibration the problem? Because software cannot calibrate a screen without being able to see it. So no, an OTA would not be able to fix that. The screen must be calibrated at the factory. 2kool4skool Software doesn't necessarily needs to see the screen in this case. Samsung can get their hands on the affected device, tweak it and figure which screen batch affected, and send tweaked software to all devices via OTA. Your comment does make sense, though. Unless Samsung can figure out which devices affected and need for fix, users probably will have to resort to the last option, go to setting and tweak it themselves manually. illregal what I'm saying is.. You can't push out an ota to adjust the screen calibration. Because how is that OTA gonna pick n choose which ones need the adjustment and which ones don't. It's a hardware issue. Samsung makes garbage. 2kool4skool They don't necessarily have to send out an OTA that needs to pick which ones need adjustment and which ones don't. They can just send an OTA that works for both as intended. But whatever, you can believe what you want to. I merely stated what I think a logical answer for this problem. Middlefinger You can if its due to a setting. HTC managed to get rid of a huge red blob in the middle of the HD2 camera with an update. Plenty, like you, assumed it was a hardware fault. Rod It's not. https://i.imgur.com/oYe2HPZ.jpg Rod The problem is, if those devices already have those values maxed out. 2kool4skool Actually, rather than fixed values, these RGB settings act more like percentage values. Meaning you can set them lower and it wouldn't make a difference unless one value is bigger than another. It's hard to describe but I'll include another screenshot. The result would be the same even if you lower those values as long as it's on the same level. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2788b47dbae19707db41c131c25f545abf51fe7ac923621517261397b1c4390b.png same as https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/78c23a79995e1f76d6daf742ac05cc0f8893b2871459eeb4cdfec41c6eef2872.png Rod Yeah, I know. That value was arbitrary. Though now I'd like to know from Ruddock himself what were the default values in his review unit. 2kool4skool Yeah, and apparently some screens might interpret those values differently / inaccurately, hence the problem. And if that's correct, an OTA fix should be logically possible. That's all what I was saying. Rod I hope so. But all OLED panels I've seen to this date, has screen tint of some color. Either red or green. 2kool4skool Can't deny that. Some OLED panels, especially the lower end ones are struggling to produce a balanced color, it's usually most noticeable while viewing white color. That's why IPS screens usually produce better whites than oleds. But oleds produce deeper black than IPS. In the end, each have strength and weaknesses. Get what you prefer. Rod Yeah. I, for one, prefer pure white. Can't stand the reddish whites on the S8 reviewed here. C Lo Who doesn't enjoy buying a $900 device and then having to fix it yourself. Sounds like a swell situation to me. /s 2kool4skool Nobody said that. It sucks that this problem happens. We're just discussing possible fix for it, not trying to disregard the problem itself. Rod Oh boy..... https://i.imgur.com/oYe2HPZ.jpg 2kool4skool You really don't get it, do you? That's why I said it's miscalibrated. Although both of those devices have the same RGB values, the affected device read and interpret those values incorrectly. On affected device, you need to lower the Red value to something like this in order to make the red tint disappear. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/5ae0be301ee03f23d53f275a783d6c59be4e7147070152bed2c42ae2ce2551fe.png These articles might explain it better that I do. If you're interested. http://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-clears-air-red-tinted-galaxy-s8-displays https://www.androidheadlines.com/2017/04/galaxy-s8s-display-reddish-tint-korean-consumers-say.html Rod Then why does the one with RED component at zero, still has red tint all over? Rod Explain this, then. https://i.imgur.com/a1e3dTw.jpg Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Pinkgate. Rod https://www.cnet.com/news/some-samsung-galaxy-s8-phones-ship-with-red-tinted-screens/ https://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/img/wdpXe9TcHb700WdDoryWeeQRgBc=/2017/04/18/20260318-f9bb-43e3-8a46-f198a6b88ccf/capture.png Badelhas A phone made entirely out of glass? lol. No, thanks. 4Ui812 There are metal parts inside 😁 Badelhas That's why it's not transparent, then! 😊 m477 I can't say I actually care the phone renders in 1080p by default, I'll take the extra battery life. Tests have demonstrated that using lower then native resolutions has no appreciable benefit to the battery. What you gain is a more stable FPS count. dabug91 Exactly, there may be a slight difference if you're constantly playing games, but regardless of whether you're in 1080p or 1440p mode, every single one of those pixels on the screen is still turned on and using the same amount of power other than pure black. makapav You will only recover energy saved on CPU and GPU cycles that would otherwise have been used for rendering those extra pixels. Morten Ulv Wont those just be used at giving you higher FPS? Either way, I guess the point was that the difference is negligible. Abhishek Saral So like if I run a 4K XPS 15 on 1080P resolution. Will I see a battery improvement? Tech Writer Not much at all. On the other hand, if you get the 1080p XPS 15, it will last much longer. Most of the higher power consumption of higher res screens comes from the panel itself. Changing render resolution doesn't change this, unless you do native res 3D rendering or play games. David Ruddock Alright, that may well be. I'll adjust to "performance." D13H4RD2L1V3 Probably the only savings you'd get is from the processor not needing to drive a lot more pixels. It's usually quite minimal at best, imperceptibly so at worst. Rod 1080p vs 1440p when drawing 2D is a non-issue, actually. godutch It's less calculations though, gpu is less used and can clock lower m477 The impact of the GPU on the battery is very, very small, unless graphically intensive games are in use. End even then, the difference between 1440p and 1080p is not that big. DanSan I pre-ordered the GS8+. Coming from the Nexus 6, this seemed to be my best option even after playing with both phones extensively the day after they were announced. I'm going to miss my Nexus experience but honestly I'm tired of being a beta tester for Googles software. Past couple of months my N6 has been almost useless at times, freezing doing basic tasks. I don't care about locked bootloaders or rooting anymore, I just want to be able to tweak a few things to my liking and have a phone that just.... works. Max If you're picky then there's a very high chance that you will regret moving to a Samsung phone if you are looking for "a phone that just... works". Samsung software has many annoyances for people accustomed to the Google Android experience. demarcmj This. Every time I try to help a family member with their galaxy device I get really frustrated trying to figure out how the damn thing works. DanSan I assume thats because you're going from stock android to Samsung experience, I can understand the confusion Zsolt V And hundreds of millions of people have no such problems. Interesting. DanSan Totally agree with you but doing simple things now are a pain for me. I just want to unlock it and take a picture or text somebody. easy and simple. catalysto Not sure what the problem is on yours. Mine can open the camera instantly with a power button double-press. DanSan That may be true, time will tell. I have an iPhone 6S as a work device, I end up using that because my Nexus 6 has become so bad. Even after a factory wipe. I will take any kind of change Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ We have two iPhone 6S phones in our family. They both "just work" unless there's an iOS update waiting. After updating, they both "just work" again. I have to wonder if some of the apps update before the OS does, and that's why the problems occur when the update hasn't yet been applied. Just a guess. Suhas I switched to S6 Edge+ eighteen months ago from a N5 after being a loyal Nexus user since the Galaxy Nexus. Surprisingly, it was the best decision ever. Back in the day I used to root, flash custom ROMs and tinker with the phone a lot which I ain't bothered to do so anymore. Also the Nexus kept failing on me in certain areas (Bluetooth, memory leaks, sub-par speakers, camera, battery etc.) and I got fed up. The S6 Edge+ was worth the price and it has been an amazing phone. Can't wait to get my hands on the S8! Switch and you will not regret. DanSan I'm pumped but definitely going to be a learning curve when it comes to samsung settings and what not. But i think we were in the same boat, just tired of tweaking and tinkering to get it to do what i want. Even now I have to make excuses for how bad my phone is, granted its a few years old but I'm over it. Gjorgi Lazarovski well you made the wrong choice going with a Samsung device, since "nothing" works on them. You always get the weirdest bug reports from Samsung users. They have issues with a bunch of apps. 2kool4skool Lol if you're talking about bugs, look no further than pixel and pixel xl. You can find bunch of articles about problems with these devices on this site. You have problems ranging from Bluetooth issue, camera halo / lens flare, dodgy connection, fingerprint issue, etc etc, I lost track. Do your research. Gjorgi Lazarovski I was talking about apps compatibility, but yeah Rod Correct. https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/3xgxg2/why_is_there_so_much_hate_against_samsung/ Rod Welcome aboard. http://i.imgur.com/qa22ZNQ.gif Roy My 6p doing the best job until today and still rocking, very smooth and very consist software.

Jaime does anybody know if the galaxy s8 has the At&t logo on the back? can't find any image of it (which is great!), but I don't want to be disappointed when my phone arrives with an ugly logo on it's back. wests It does not. The Rebrand Nation From laggy touchwiz 5 of the galaxy s5 to near perfect smasung experience 8.1 Not bad for 4 years FeelThePoveR Considering that OnePlus rose from nothing to the company they are today in 4 years and the fact that Samsung is supposed to be the top player with highest development budget of all, it's pretty bad. Bob Marley They didn't rise from nothing. They have the funding and resources of Oppo, a major smartphone player, behind their back. FeelThePoveR They had to build their "brand" from nothing and their success is impressive, becouse at least where I live people prefer to buy things from known brands even if it's not the best bang for buck, as they don't trust the newcomers. Middlefinger But Oneplus phones still have boatloads of issues and very dubious quality, both hardware and software. FeelThePoveR Boatloads of issues? I wouldn't say so, every device has it's quirks but OnePlus is really good at listening to the community and fixing them. Dubious quality? 1+3 and 1+3T are the fastest Snapdragon 820 and 821 devices ever for half of the price of other comperable devices so what about that is so dubious? Maybe camera is not a top notch one but it's good anyway, certainly good enough for the price. Middlefinger Build quality, and reliability is the problem. I'm a regional manager for a electronics service/retail company, we get a lot back, they just aren't made very well. FeelThePoveR Well I've seen a couple from the inside and they seemed really neatly designed/put together and besides even phones from the "old players" could cause more trouble then 1+ ones i.e. LG with its loose components on the motherboard causing bootlops, Samsung Note 7 burning battery or my oldy HTC M7 purple camera tint issue. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ From feature-free stock Android to Nougat with split screen. Not bad for 4 years. Middlefinger Really it was done in 1 year. The S5 wasnt good, but the S6 was in a different league. The S7 and S8 have just been refinements really. Rod Near perfect? http://i.imgur.com/qa22ZNQ.gif http://i.imgur.com/kHx9ayV.gif Nishant i guess this would be a great upgrade from my Galaxy S3!!! :) Cat Astrophy So what you're saying...is that this phone is THE BOMB? Typical Samsung. I like my phones non-explodey. My name is…. biased, as always. You call this phone pricey? Then what is Pixel? DanSan There is a difference between being pricey for the sake of being pricey (read: Pixel) and being pricey because you have the best spec available. lomsha Yep at least this looks and feels like an $850 phone. Gjorgi Lazarovski Why biased tho? They called out the Pixel for it's price too, wtf. Like, everyone did. David Ruddock I don't know, maybe read our review? "Price: There's no way around it, the price points are high. iPhone high. And you're going to be hard-pressed to convince the value-obsessed that there's nearly $800 of smartphone in a Pixel XL." http://www.androidpolice.com/2016/10/18/google-pixel-review-a-very-good-phone-by-google/ My name is…. Pixel is a dud, worst value for money ever. You should have been far more negative for Pixel than you were. Sweet talking it doesn't change things. Just because you mention that the price was high, doent meant that you shouldnt have angrily bashed it (if you were a subjective reviewer) And no, S8 doesn't ask a lot. Its a true flagship with the appropriate price. 1+3 owner here. 2kool4skool Shhh... Pixels have G logo on their back. That alone worth the $200. Seriously though, pixels are often get too many undeserved praises (just my opinion) in tech sites, probably because it's the "nerds and purists" devices, which make up most of tech sites target audience. It even got best phone of the year award if I'm not mistaken despite the fact it doesn't have a lot of features a $800 phones should have anf it's infested with bugs and problems even until this day. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ All Google phones get undeserved praise, especially on Android sites. The reason for that should be self-evident. It's self-preservation. Defenestratus It's just a dang shame that you aren't on the editorial payroll at AP. Just a dang shame I tell ya. Max Big comment fail... Both are pricey and both were called for it. Middlefinger Still hung up on updates i see. Is Googles 7.1.whatever really any better than 7.0 with Samsungs mods? Whats the difference? Whats the advantage? In reality, there isnt any. Samsung doesnt run stock android, and isnt bound by Googles mods, or Googles fixes. It can do its own, and that may mean having a slightly lower number in the settings, but it has no negative effect on the security or experience. Other OEMs are the same LG never used 4.4.3 or 4.4.4 on the G2 or 3, but had al the fixes and updates they needed, because the Google updates were device specific and not necessary. Benjamin Walburn It might not make a difference for bugs and security flaws, but certain APIs need the OS update. The image keyboard and app icon shortcuts are two examples. More importantly, there's just no reason to not use 7.1. It's been 4 months since official launch, and major OEMs get early access. Middlefinger Maybe Samsung arent happy with the quality? 7.1 and its variant have been rather.. buggy, of late. Lollipop was like that, its was the worst, and i know Samsung had a lot of custom code in their version. There is no reason though why Samsung cant implement its own version of APIs, or simply wait to avoid issues. Rod Just stop. Middlefinger Stop what? Do you even read this site, the evidence is right here. Rod Samsung doesn't keep their phones updated because they're too busy making unwanted, duplicate apps. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yeah, Google never makes unwanted duplicate apps. Rod Such as? tim242 You need to get a life, if all you have to do is bitch about duplicate apps. EVERY DAY. Rod My life is fine, thanks. Middlefinger No they make time to release to make sure the software works properly. They have to do that because Googles release often doesn't, just like all the problems seen on 7.1.2 lately. Unwanted apps you say?? Like most of the Google apps.. Rod You make it look better than it is. Samsung phones are the most buggy, according to the developers. Middlefinger Are they now, where is this 'developer' news i seem to have missed? Rod https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/3xgxg2/why_is_there_so_much_hate_against_samsung/ Middlefinger One temporary example that is not longer true. What about all of googles messy code and bugs, that kill phones? Benjamin Walburn Oh, they definitely could, but a duplicate API isn't the same as the original, especially in Android. App developers would have to add additional code for the Samsung API. Even mirroring the API entirely wouldn't work, as apps look at the system API level to decide how to run. Even if Samsung copied it perfectly, apps would still detect it as an older Android version and not use the features. I can't comment on the bugginess of the later release. I haven't had any problems with updates, but that would be a valid concern. Godspoken That hero image is freaking amazing. Is the picture on the screen photoshopped? I almost read AP reviews for the great photographs of phones as much as I do for the actual facts and opinions at this point. David Ruddock It's a real image. The screen is color corrected a bit (thanks to Jeff for that) to match the tone of the pavement. But I took the photo on the S8, zoomed in and lined it up, then took the picture with my RX10, yeah. Rod Of course it was edited, to remove the red tint. Lol Crafted Crows It is an impressive piece of hardware but after 1 day of use my fingers hurt :). I have the S7 and I find that size to be perfect. While the screen gorgeous, it's too tall for 1 hand use and the infamous hamburger menu is killing my fingers. Not comfortable at all. Margaritas Ante Porcos Great review. As always. Beautiful phone but we won't see the beauty because we'll have to hide this fragile cutie inside a case. Also Bixby is total crap. So sad to say this but as many other disappointed Galaxy fans I will skip on S8. Absolutely not worth buying. At least not for that money. Fr0gg0 Better luck next time, Samsung. Dallas King Fingerprint scanner on the power button, on the side would have been better. Eumelanin Knight Samsung sees to have an innovative then perfect cycle with their phone. I look forward to seeing what's up with the S9. Yup, I went there. That full screen fingerprint sensor, maybe? Rod There's a really noticeable red tint on that display tim242 Where is that in the review? Oh, it is not there.

The story you linked says only SOME UNITS AND CAN BE MANUALLY FIXED. Rod Well, let's ask @rdr0b11:disqus then BTW: never saw anyone take pictures in broad daylight whilst illuminating the subject with a red light. Maybe the sun shines differently where he lives. Roy You are right, the red tint is clearly noticeable from the pictures and it's bothering me a lot that no one (not even the reviewer) is talking about it. Rod As a LCD-phone owner, I'm deeply disturbed by screen tint. I like my whites milk-like. mlj11 I know Bixby's gonna be unpopular (around the enthusiast crowd at least) but I wish I had something like Bixby Vision. After Goggles' apparent abandonment by Google, I still haven't found a simple and good enough replacement for it. Using Assistant on my Pixel XL just plain doesn't work for stuff like item recognition or QR code reading. Rod Cannot unsee the lag. http://i.imgur.com/kHx9ayV.gif Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Flipboard has always been very laggy. It doesn't surprise me that its replacement is also laggy. Personally, it doesn't matter to me. I never use Flipboard anymore, I don't use Google Now, and I would be very unlikely to use Bixby. ericshmerick The defense has begun lol Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ No defense. Bixby's info thing is laggy. If that matters to you, don't buy the phone. Rod You can deal with low framerate...

He's not even touching the phone, except when he touches a grayed out option that doesn't do anything. That makes me think your Bixby lag gif is fake, too. Rod If you watched the video, you'll see that he mentions the software has problems, exactly when that part is displayed. whispy_snippet "Fake". Classic. m477 Yeah, Michael Fisher is payed by Samsung competitors to make the S8 look laggy, obviously. Iamsecond Your comment was brilliantly sarcastic, but 'payed?' Seriously? I'm sorry for picking on you, but this is the third time I've seen this misspelling this week and I'm starting to wonder if I'm going slightly mad! Surely 'paid' is a common enough word that everyone should know how to spell it? m477 Welp, I must have been drunk or something. I usually write in mostly correct English, I swear. Miles Reiter To add on to what others have already said, that's not a grayed out option, there's no scenario in Instagram where the search button will be grayed out and non-functional. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ So he just didn't touch it. It's very obvious he's not touching anything on the phone in that GIF. You could also take a screen shot of that Instagram page, and fake it that way. I'll believe these problems when I see them widely reported, not because some bozo posts a gif. JC Just go watch the video. Winston Thats a strange issue. I loaded the S8 home screen + Hello Bixby onto my S7. No lag. Rod It's called inconsistent performance. Which means it won't happen all the time. PoisonApple31 Which is why it is not a big deal Rod For someone shelling out 800 bucks for a phone, I think it's not ok. iPhones will be butter-smooth for the same price.

So, overall, very similar levels of performance. Shows that Samsung was ahead of the curve last year, meaning that the Galaxy S7 should age well CPU-wise. Marty I think I can easily pass on the S8. I prefer a device not have a pink tinted display. The last time this happened was with the HTC 10. Too much competition, Samsung, for you to put out lackluster products. 4Ui812 David Ruddock 2 questions. Do you know if the bootloader is locked like on the S7E from T-MOBILE ? Why is this 8 hour old article pushed to the top of the list ? I think I know the answer to the second question. But do you have any info on the first ? Rod Because it's relevant? 4Ui812 Paid. Rod Yes, they get paid better when more people click on pages with ads. roverstim ewww, pink tint. D13H4RD2L1V3 I can definitely see the fingerprint sensor placement being an afterthought. Had Synaptics and Samsung got that display sensor working in time, the feature where you can wake the device from sleep by "pressing" the portion of the display that houses the home button would have a lot more worth. Oh well, hope it's ready in time for the Note 8, but with rumors that even Apple is having issues with it, we may have to wait for 2018. I don't find Bixby all that useful, and certainly not to the point where it needs its own button. It has its merits, but overall, I feel that it's one of those features where people use once or twice after unboxing and then forget that it existed, like Siri, or those who are deeply-vested in the Google ecosystem would probably just use Google Now. I find that rather sad, because some of its other add-ons, such as the ability to play other forms of audio through the device itself while it's casting another audio source via Bluetooth is one of those things that are immensely useful. I just wish that they're actually more prominently shown so that people know it exists. It's a nice phone overall, though. Makes me optimistic for the next Galaxy Note. tim242 THE CAMERA IS NOT THE SAME AS THE S7. 260 VS 333 Rod Who do those numbers represent? tim242 The S7 has the Sony 260. The S8 has the Sony 333. dblock I am a huge fan of rooting and ROMing my phones, but the truth is, being a crack flasher and flashing new ROMs all the time is really time consuming. So while it will take a while to get used to not being able to do this, and losing Viper4Android (hoping I can make Samsung's EQ work somewhat close to V4A) and some other customizations/tweaks, overall I think I will be more satisfied not worrying about trying to flash the "best" ROM all the damn time. I do hold out hope that basic root is achieved on the phone so I can get V4A going on this thing, but I won't hold out too long. 2kool4skool If you're so worried about sound, galaxies have Adapt Sound feature that you might want to try out. I'm also a former user of viper4android, but decided to ditch it last year because adapt sound is easier to set up. It also sounds fantastic on my hd 449. dblock I can't remember if Adapt Sound works with Bluetooth headphones or not, do you know if it does? That's why I loved V4A, could really fine tune all different output types; phone speakers, headset, Bluetooth and dock. 2kool4skool Well, that's a bummer. No, as far as I know it doesn't work with Bluetooth headphones. ROB You need to add something... DO NOT BUY the unlocked version Chips N Care to explain? ROB Google the S7 unlocked fiasco...they are still on 6.0.1...all other S7 have been updated to 7.0 and they have abandoned the ones bought directly from Samsung... Cakefish Galaxy S7 Geekbench scores. The Exynos 8890 processor was ahead of its time, it'll remain very competitive throughout 2017. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/ccc4e4d7770fbc4f43c68d526b56060883fe49a88537a5e39d175e8207d6c05e.png Rod If even the Snapdragon 800 holds well to this day.. blairh Fingerprint placement is complete garbage. Still no stereo speakers. S8 is too tall. More impressed with the S8 Plus. TeeJay1100 Size is personal preference. I'll say this, after playing with them in Best buy, the S8 feels just right. The S8+ is a tad taller. blairh The S8 is too tall IMO. tim242 The S8+ is even taller... blairh I just think the S8 is way too tall when compared to the iPhone 7. Apple will be releasing a 5.8" screen phone this fall with roughly the same footprint of the iPhone 7. That to me makes a lot more sense then going so tall as the S8 for the same size screen. tim242 You have no idea what dimensions the next iphones will be. blairh You're right. But I also believe the strong rumors of a 5.8" screen with a footprint the size of the current iPhone 7. tim242 There were those same strong rumors about the S8. The current iphone 7 would not fit a 16:9 5.8" display... blairh I believe this is what we will see this fall. http://www.iclarified.com/60037/diagram-allegedly-reveals-design-of-58inch-iphone-with-4mm-bezels-images tim242 Yeah, no. Apple has had gigantic bezels for 10 years. They aren't going to be suddenly nothing. Rod Isn't the S8 even taller? Lol blairh I'm assuming you mean the S8 Plus. Yes, it is, but it also has a larger screen. I just think the S8 is way too tall when compared to the iPhone 7. Apple will be releasing a 5.8" screen phone this fall with roughly the same footprint of the iPhone 7. That to me makes a lot more sense then going so tall as the S8 for the same size screen. Rod But the S8+ is proportionally taller than the S8 lol. blairh I understand that. But I can swallow that size phone when the screen is that large. I think the next iPhone will give you the same size screen in a smaller package. Semianonymous Kinda reminds me of the s6 in a lot of ways. Sacrifices made to acheive a new design. At least they didn't kill the waterproofing and SD slot this time around. lomsha I'm quite tempted. Paul Quinn We knew about the poor fingerprint sensor placement for quite some time. I thought that's probably something that could prove to be less of an issue over time (muscle memory). But now it's sounding like it doesn't even work well. That is enough to kill it for me. I am spoiled by instantaneous unlock on the Mate 9. I don't understand how a brand new phone from THE premier Android manufacturer isn't at least getting close to that. Rod Rushed changed. It was supposed to be underneath the screen. Zahir_SMASH I just want to know what round icon pack that is. Cakefish Pretty sure it's the same one as I use: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.themezilla.pixelui Rod Looks neat for a free app. Zahir_SMASH Thanks! Roy Am I the only one noticing the red-tinted screen issue with the photos of the reviewed device? tim242 Some units have that, mostly the units sent out early. It can be adjusted in settings. Roy Not necessarily. Xda reported that in some units the red-tinted display is not being fixed even after adjusting the rgb and samung is replaging those units. Also, why this reviewed unit was not adjusted before taking the pictures? Just look at them and tell me, the issue is pretty noticeable. Rod Don't worry, there are lots of people in denial here. Rod Oh boy... https://i.imgur.com/oYe2HPZ.jpg Rod Nope. ×XWreckTeamX× Which pics are you talking about I cant notice it that much. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ It seems pretty obvious to me in all the photos of the phone where there's white on the display. The white looks pinkish. The screen shots look pure white, though. morrisp Are you in Studio City, David? Ahmad Alnusif Is this review applicable also to the Exynos version of S8+? I see mention of SnapDragon 835 specific features so will they be there in the international version? Fred Question is, where did you get that burger ? Anton Kuznetsov ADOPTABLE STORAGE Does it have it? Rod Seeing as they blocked it in the S7, I wouldn't hold my breath. Nathan J This is the first Android phone since last April when I chose the iPhone 6s over the LG G5 (which, given the bootloop reports, was probably a good choice) that has made me seriously consider switching back. One thought keeps repeating itself to me: the 2015 iPhone 6s will most likely get updates for one year after the 2017 Galaxy S8 stops getting them, given the companies' five and two year update ranges. I can see entry level phones only getting a year or two of updates, but a $750 or $850 phone? This is a hard truth that Android fanboys are going to have to accept, and really start demanding changes to. It's one thing that Apple absolutely does better, and I think it's something that would not be very hard to change. Let's demand five years of updates. Apple can do it and they're more profitable than anyone. Stop. Don't make excuses about why Apple's phones aren't that good or their updates aren't as significant. Don't excuse bad behavior. Have the courage to demand better. If all the phone manufacturers adopted all the best practices of their competitors, and shed their biggest problems, imagine how much more awesome phones would be. That said, we really don't know how long Samsung will update the S8. Maybe they give it three years. Who knows. They've done almost everything right here, and I commend them for that. I wouldn't have minded if they kept the physical home/fingerprint button, if they did it like on the iPhone 7. Not a real button but a part of the screen that vibrates in such a way that feels like a button. Go to a Best Buy and check it out. It's very cool. The fingerprint scanner as-is on the S8... I have seen no one praise this. I'm sure Samsung knows, and it was just too late for them to change it. If everything is the same next year (but updated of course), but the fingerprint reader is mid-center of the back, the S9 will be damn near perfect. As for Bixby — in my opinion, the less said about it, Siri, and Google Assistant, the better. I'll just Google it. Or Bing it if I know I'll be running into ad-infested sites (like Wikia) as the Google app tunnels around my ad blocker (iOS). Either way, I'll take a search app over an assistant app any day of the week. I've tried Siri, Google, and Cortana and have found all of them lacking. So no thanks to Bixby. Disappointing about buttongate, but not a dealbreaker, either. Rod In most cases, the updates are ceased due to the SoC vendor (read: Qualcomm) not providing new blobs after 24 months. That's why there's a rumor Google is designing its own chip, like Apple and Samsung do, so they don't get blocked by Qualcomm. Nathan J I had a Motorola Photon. We heard all the excuses. At the end of the day, it's still a flagship that got zero updates, so it doesn't really matter whose fault it is or why. I mean, it's interesting on a trivial level to find out why, but you're no less screwed at the end of the day. That said, if Google could get control over the hardware in their phones, they'd be better off. Maybe. Can they make more money selling phones that are supported for five years? That's a cycle and a half they're pissing away. Apple can take that. Rod I really hope Google pulls an Apple someday. 5 years of support sounds great to me. Talos the Robot You are reviewing a defected phone with a red tint display and you are awarding it with editor's choice "Most Wanted" accolade, hahaha LOL.... francoism Still sure it'll suffer from the much staggered OTA updates. roverstim Seriously, no mention of the pink screen in the review ? Other OEM's would be picked up on this Rod This bothered me too, seeing as how evident it is. tim242 http://m.androidcentral.com/samsung-clears-air-red-tinted-galaxy-s8-displays Rod I'd like to see a pic of this review unit after calibrating.

Ash First official android with kernel version 4.4? dirtyjudo Cash me when it's time for security update. How bout dat? Daniel Tiberius System level EQ sounds neato. I'll have to play with that. Also I read that the Bluetooth to two separate devices feature comes with Bluetooth 5, or the processor and not from Samsung. Anyone know? Peter World Citizen It's best to read some reviews from Apple's love child: The Verge ... When the oppositions praise their main competitor's device then it must be really good. 1. http://www.theverge.com/2017/4/18/15328968/samsung-galaxy-s8-review-s8-plus 2. http://www.theverge.com/2017/4/19/15354444/samsung-galaxy-s8-big-screen-ergonomics 3. http://www.theverge.com/2017/4/18/15338052/samsung-galaxy-s8-touchwiz-android-software Anunnaki "At $750 and $850 for the S8 and S8+, respectively, there's no denying Samsung is asking a lot for the privilege of joining the Galaxy S club this year." It's at-least priced better than the Pixel. Jay I was interested in finishing the review until I saw that you tested it in 1080p mode only. I understand that the phone came with the setup initially, but that setting is what many people will want to use. Rod What's the difference, tbh? Roberto Should have mentioned a killer feature that for once has been flawlessly implemented by big S development team, Dex.

Russia's Top Search Engine Yandex Launches Elvish Translation ServiceThe Russian search engine Yandex has developed a translator which is helping some of the world's rarest languages to flourish. Catching up with its big rival Google, which is able to translate over 100 languages, Yandex can now translate 94.  However, Yandex is a translator with a difference: its software is able to translate some of the world's rarest languages thanks to a complex statistical model that can pick up linguistic patterns without a large body of bilingual texts. One reason why Google and other translation services tend to provide translation of the world's most common languages, is because the translation software depends on having access to a corpus of texts in both languages. Common sources are the Bible or Koran, which have been translated into practically all languages. While this is easy enough to find for languages such as Russian and English, finding these texts in less common languages is a more difficult task. © AP Photo/ Caleb Jones Oxford English DictionaryYandex began to seriously investigate the possibility of adding rare languages to its program after an employee in the firm's office in the Netherlands asked the developers to add his mother tongue, Papiamento, to the translator.  This was a challenge, because Papiamento is a relatively small language, a spoken by about 330,000 people in the Caribbean. Since there are so few translations between Papiamento and other languages, the developers decided to try a different approach. They looked at other languages with similarities to Papiamento, in order to identify the relations between them and use that information to build a translator. © Photo: Screenshot/Yandex A screenshot of a Yandex translation from German to Elvish, Tolkien's fictional language which was launched last year "We moved away from the traditional perception of each language as an independent system, and began to take into account the kinship between them. In practice, this means that if we need to build a translation for a language where there isn't much data, we can use other, larger, related languages," Yandex Translate developer Anton Dvorkovich explains in a blog post. "Their individual models (morphology, syntax, vocabulary) can be used to fill the voids in the models of a 'small' language. This might just seem like blind copying of words and rules between languages, but the technology works a little smarter." "This kinship can be different – for example, in Yiddish, most of the lexicon intersects with German and in Papiamento a lot is borrowed from Spanish and Portuguese. In the Tatar and Bashkir languages, there is similar syntax and morphology." © AP Photo/ Andrew Harnik Lost in Trumpslation: Japanese Student Translates Trump’s TweetsYandex explains that its efforts will help speakers of rare languages to preserve their mother tongue. The availability of an internet translator allows them to maintain and spread their language online by creating their own pages on websites such as Wikipedia, which is available in more than 270 languages. A Bashkir speaker, for example, can take a Wikipedia page in another language, translate it and then edit the results. The technology helps Bashkir speakers to increase their presence on the internet a lot faster than they would be able to otherwise. In addition, Yandex hopes its statistical model will help linguists to better understand the relationships between languages.  "We expect that in the future, the technology we have developed for the use of data from related languages will be implemented on other areas and will generally help to better understand the links between languages, and consequently – more accurately translate texts. Therefore, we can say that this technology is not so much about 'small' languages as it is about establishing links between different languages of the world," Dvorkovich said.

An update coming out today will enable Home’s built-in assistant to learn the different voices of up to six people, although they can’t all be talking to the internet-connected speaker at the same time. Distinguishing voices will allow Home to be more personal in some of its responses, depending on who triggers the assistant with the phrase, “OK Google” or “Hey Google.” For instance, once Home is trained to recognise a user named Joe, the assistant will automatically be able to tell him what traffic is like on his commute, list events on his daily calendar or even play his favorite songs. Then another user named Jane could get similar information from Home, but customised for her. The ability to distinguish voices may help Home siphon sales from Amazon.Com’s Echo, a competing product that features its own voice-activated assistant, Alexa. The Echo doesn’t yet recognise different voices, so Alexa can’t retrieve more personal information for different accounts. Google’s voice-distinction feature, however, won’t prevent unauthorised users from activating the assistant, as long as Home’s microphone is turned on.

By: Associated Press | San Francisco | Updated: April 20, 2017 10:58 PM Google.org, the philanthropic arm of Google, today announced grants of $ 8.4 million to four NGOs in India. (Reuters) Google’s voice-activated assistant can now recognise who’s talking to it on Google’s Home speaker. An update coming out today will enable Home’s built-in assistant to learn the different voices of up to six people, although they can’t all be talking to the internet-connected speaker at the same time. Distinguishing voices will allow Home to be more personal in some of its responses, depending on who triggers the assistant with the phrase, “OK Google” or “Hey Google.” For instance, once Home is trained to recognise a user named Joe, the assistant will automatically be able to tell him what traffic is like on his commute, list events on his daily calendar or even play his favorite songs. Then another user named Jane could get similar information from Home, but customised for her. The ability to distinguish voices may help Home siphon sales from Amazon.com’s Echo, a competing product that features its own voice-activated assistant, Alexa. The Echo doesn’t yet recognise different voices, so Alexa can’t retrieve more personal information for different accounts. Google’s voice-distinction feature, however, won’t prevent unauthorised users from activating the assistant, as long as Home’s microphone is turned on. That loophole allowed Burger King to recently air a TV commercial that included the phrase “OK Google” to prompt Home’s assistant to recite the ingredients of the fast-food restaurant’s Whopper burger from a Wikipedia entry. Also Watch: Google quickly blocked Burger King’s commercial from toying with the Home assistant, but the marketing stunt illustrated how the technology can be manipulated. Voice- personalisation eventually could enable Home’s users to block others from accessing the device, but Google isn’t ready to do that yet. “It’s important to balance making sure the assistant on Google Home is still useful and able to answer a guest’s or friend’s question while also answering a few specific questions just for you,” Google spokeswoman Kara Stockton said. The voice-distinction feature also isn’t being offered for the same digital assistant that operates on Google’s Pixel phone and other smartphones running on the latest version of its Android software. Google doesn’t think the technology is necessary on phones because most of those devices are password-protected and are usually used by just one person. No Comments.

Not any more. Today they are monsters with increasingly hefty international ambitions. Alibaba, China’s biggest e-commerce group, handles more transactions each year than do eBay and Amazon combined. Jack Ma, its chairman, pledges to serve 2bn consumers around the world within 20 years. Tencent, which specialises in online games and social media, is now the world’s tenth most valuable public firm, worth some $275bn. Pony Ma (no relation), its chairman, wants China to “preside over the global tech revolution of the future”. But as the two firms become global forces, the third member of China’s “BAT” trio of internet giants, Baidu, an online-search firm that came to dominate the mainland market after Google left the country to avoid censorship, is lagging behind.

First, Western companies usually prefer to focus on a few core areas, whereas Chinese internet firms typically try to do everything from cloud computing to digital payments. When this works, as with Tencent’s wildly successful app, WeChat, the results can be impressive. Second, with the exception of political censorship, the internet sector in China is lightly regulated. Facebook, Apple and Google, in contrast, face increasing scrutiny. Chinese internet firms can achieve market domination of a sort that would attract close attention in other markets. The third difference is that they can succeed on a rapid and massive scale because the state-dominated economy is so inefficient. Often there is not even a physical infrastructure to leapfrog—so-called third-tier cities, for example, often lack big retail centres. Nationwide there is one shopping mall per 1.2m people. A huge home market has not stopped the trio from fighting bloody turf wars among each other. The outcome to this battle is rapidly becoming clear. Tencent and Alibaba are surging ahead; a series of own goals has left Baidu far behind. The common jibe about Baidu among local experts is that it is becoming the Yahoo of China, a once-dominant search giant that sank owing to a lack of innovation and a series of management blunders. Its revenue growth fell to 6.3% in 2016, down from 35% in 2015 and 54% in 2014. The firm gets some nine-tenths of its revenues from online ads, but this income is plunging as marketers redirect spending from search ads on Baidu to social-media networks like WeChat and mobile-commerce platforms run by Alibaba. Meanwhile, Baidu is burning cash trying to keep its various big bets on artificial intelligence (AI), online video, virtual and augmented-reality technologies, and “online to offline” (O2O) services going. One of China’s most respected business consultants is pessimistic about its future: “There is very little chance they’ll be relevant in five years.” Of the other two giants, Tencent is probably the most fearsome. It already has higher revenues and profits than Alibaba (see chart). Its value is set to climb as it ramps up advertising on WeChat (provided that does not provoke a backlash from users). Its main weapon against Alibaba is its stake in JD.com, the country’s second-biggest e-commerce firm, led by Richard Liu, one of China’s most aggressive and successful serial entrepreneurs. JD.com has adopted an expensive “asset-heavy” business model akin to Amazon’s in America. Thus far, its vast investments in warehouses, logistics and couriers have not come anywhere near toppling Alibaba. But last year the company saw its revenues rise to $37.5bn, up from $28bn the previous year. Its share of China’s business-to-consumer market rose to 25% in 2016, up from 18% at the end of 2014. If Mr Liu’s investments in infrastructure start to pay off, much of Alibaba’s future domestic growth could be at risk. That threat may explain why Mr Ma is not content with Alibaba’s overall 70% share of the local e-commerce market. In 2016 it spent $1bn to win control of Lazada, South-East Asia’s biggest e-commerce firm. In March Lazada launched a new service for Singaporeans directly to shop on Taobao, one of Alibaba’s two domestic e-commerce platforms (the other is Tmall). Mr Ma last year persuaded the G20 summit of leading countries to endorse his proposal for an “electronic world trade platform” (eWTP), to make it easier for small businesses to trade across borders. Last month Alibaba launched a “digital free-trade zone” as part of the initiative, in Malaysia. This public-private partnership, which involves simplifying both logistics and payments, will help small merchants. Mr Ma’s chief weapon for going global, however, is Ant Financial, which was spun out of Alibaba before the latter’s $25bn flotation in 2014 in New York. In China the unit offers services ranging from online banking to investment products; it even runs the mainland’s first proper consumer credit-scoring agency, Sesame Credit, which uses big data to work out the creditworthiness of punters. Ant already has more than 450m customers in China and is going overseas with gusto. It has investments in local online-payments firms in Thailand, the Philippines, Singapore and South Korea. In America Ant is in a frenzied bidding and lobbying war with Euronet, an American rival, to buy MoneyGram International, a money-transfer firm. On April 17th Ant raised its initial offer for MoneyGram by over a third to $1.2bn, topping Euronet’s bid. Tencent is also making bold acquisitions abroad. A consortium that it led spent $8.6bn to acquire Finland’s Supercell last year, a deal that turned Tencent into the world’s biggest purveyor of online games. Together with Taiwan’s Foxconn, a contract-manufacturing giant, the firm invested $175m last year into Hike Messenger, an Indian messaging app akin to America’s WhatsApp. It was also an early investor in America’s Snapchat, another popular messaging app, whose parent company Snap went public in March. One reason for these purchases is that Tencent’s earlier efforts to promote WeChat abroad (including a splashy advertising campaign in Europe featuring Lionel Messi, a footballer) flopped. Established social networks such as Facebook and WhatsApp proved too entrenched to dislodge. They also did some copying of their own: once they adopted some of WeChat’s innovations, Western consumers had little reason to switch to the Chinese network. Such investments have been in Tencent’s core areas, away from turf occupied by Alibaba and Baidu. Sometimes, the trio end up co-operating, if not by design. All three BAT firms are backers of Didi Chuxing, a ride-hailing firm with global pretensions of its own. But in other ways their domestic war is spilling into foreign markets. India is one such battleground. This month, together with eBay and Microsoft, Tencent invested $1.4bn into Flipkart, a leading Indian online retailer. Alibaba and Ant together are reported to have invested nearly $900m in Paytm, India’s top online-payments firm; in February, Paytm launched an e-commerce portal akin to Alibaba’s Tmall to take on Flipkart and Amazon in India. Elsewhere, Tencent unveiled a service last month that will allow firms in Europe to use WeChat to sell on the mainland. This will let them sell directly into China, avoiding red tape. Tencent also recently invested $1.8bn in America’s Tesla, a pioneer in electric and autonomous vehicles. That is a particular challenge to Baidu, which is betting its future on machine learning and AI. Baidu’s push abroad is mainly a way to get access to talent in these fields. The firm has just started its first recruiting campaign at top American universities, including Stanford University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. It has a respected AI laboratory in Silicon Valley, despite the recent departure of Andrew Ng, an AI expert. But Baidu does not have the same firepower as Alibaba and Tencent. It tried but has failed to conquer foreign markets such as Japan with its search engine. This week it opened up its self-driving technology to rivals, as Tesla did in 2014, but it has a long way to go before it makes an impact in autonomous driving. Grandiose BAT statements about global aims should be taken with a pinch of salt. It would be an error to neglect the profitable domestic market. Goldman Sachs, an investment bank, reckons that China’s online retail market will more than double in size by 2020, to $1.7trn. As Duncan Clark, author of a recent book on Alibaba, points out, whatever headlines Mr Ma and other internet bosses make with their overseas ventures, “it takes a lot to get away from the sheer gravity of China.” But at home and abroad, one thing is clear: China’s internet titans cannot be ignored.

Neural networks will then analyze the samples and detect certain characteristics of a person’s voice. From that point on, any time you say “Ok Google” or “Hey Google” to your Google Home, the neural network will compare the sound of your voice to its previous analysis so it can understand if it’s you speaking or not. This comparison takes place only on your device, in a matter of milliseconds. This support is rolling out starting today, with a card popping up at the top of the Google Home app when “multi-user is available.” From there, users can link their accounts, as well as set preferences for Google Assistant and other features, including personalized music and commute times. A single Google Home can recognize up to six users, with the feature beginning to roll out in the U.S. This detection will expand to U.K. devices in the coming months.

Google is supposedly planning to introduce an ad-blocking feature to its Google Chrome web browser, according to people familiar with plans of the company. A Google Chrome ad blocker feature may be introduced in the coming weeks to the billions of people who use the browser across the world. It has been reported that Google is considering blocking all advertising that appears on sites with offensive adverts, meaning site owners will be required to ensure all adverts meet Google’s standards or face the risk of having their adverts blocked across their sites in Chrome. According to Wall Street Journal, this has not been confirmed and Google has so far refused to comment. Ad-blockers are used to disable particular pieces of code whilst web pages load, which means that adverts that many websites rely on to make money are classed as invisible.

The technology came about due to the rise of socially irresponsible sites that “dumped” excessive ads onto users. “However, it was and is the socially responsible sites that are ultimately paying the price for their use. We can’t lose sight of the impact ad-blocking has on the web sites people visit on a regular basis. Using an ad blocker, let alone integrating one into the core of a web browser, undermines the very industry that funds many of the world’s most popular web destinations. “What is undeniable is that most web sites that offer content to an audience for free are reliant on advertising to function and operate a viable business. Without ad revenue they can’t pay rent, buy content, pay journalists and fund the infrastructure of the site. This means less free and decent content for us end users, which is something none of us want. Someone must pay somewhere and advertising has been shown time and time again as the most viable way to fund online services.” People familiar with the company’s plans have said Google is hoping to gain growth of blocking tools offered by third-party companies, some of which even charge fees for allowing ads to pass through their filters. Also, as Google Chrome is used by a large proportion of browsers globally the use of ad-filters is likely to give Google more control over ad-blocking as opposed to other browsers.

Do you have a bunch of people fighting over the single Google Home in your abode? Google is about to restore the peace. The Web giant today started rolling out a highly requested feature for its voice-powered speaker: support for multiple accounts. Now, up to six people can connect their accounts to one Google Home, and the speaker will recognize each person's voice and respond accordingly. The feature is launching today for Home users in the US, and should arrive in the UK in the "coming months," Google said. So now, when you say "Okay Google, good morning," the speaker will tell you what's on your schedule for the day and how your commute looks instead of responding with information for your spouse, who set up the device. To try out this feature, be sure you have the latest version of the Google Home app. Then, open the app and look for a card that says "multi-user is available." If you don't see this card, click on the icon in the top right to see all your connected devices. When you see your Google Home on the list, select "Link your account." From there, the device will ask you to say the phrases "Ok Google" and "Hey Google" two times each. Those phrases will be analyzed by a neural network that can detect the characteristics of your voice. Related Google Home Now Controls More of Your Home Google Home Now Controls More of Your Home Through this process "you'll teach your Assistant to understand it's you, not your partner, family member or roommate—and vice versa, based on who's speaking," Product Manager Yury Pinsky wrote in a blog post. That way, in the future, "any time you say 'Ok Google' or 'Hey Google' to your Google Home, the neural network will compare the sound of your voice to its previous analysis so we can understand if it's you speaking or not," Pinsky explained. "This comparison takes place only on your device, in a matter of milliseconds." For certain features, such as personalized music and commute information, you'll also need to set up your preferences in the app. Back to top Previous : Amazon Tap Gets Hands-Free Mode By Angela Moscaritolo Reporter Angela has been a PCMag reporter since January 2012.

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Hayley Tsukayama By Hayley Tsukayama April 20 at 1:10 PM Follow @htsuka The new Google Pixel phone is displayed next to a Google Home smart speaker in 2016 after a product event in San Francisco. (Eric Risberg/Associated Press) Smart home hubs are continuing to evolve, and Google just added a pretty important feature to its own hub, the Google Home. Previously, Home linked up only to the account of whoever set it up first. Now, the device will be able to handle multiple accounts and tell who's speaking to it, offering personalized answers to some questions. That is a feature that Amazon's Echo doesn't have. And it's important for a voice assistant designed to run your household. For an assistant such as Siri, which lives on devices used by just one person, multi-account support isn't as important. But home hubs sit in a central location and operate such things as your lights or your thermostat, which everyone will want to be able to control. Being able to identify an individual's voice may also help cut down on some unwanted surprises. Google said in a statement that the new feature makes it so that “only you would be able to shop via Google Home.” So others — i.e., your children or an intelligent parrot — shouldn't be able to tell Home to buy something on your account. That avoids instances like one in San Diego in January when Amazon Echo units started ordering dollhouses after hearing a news anchor on television repeat what a girl had said when she had ordered a dollhouse and some cookies. The anchor was reporting on a story about — what else? — a child buying something without permission on the Echo. (Amazon chief executive Jeffrey P. Bezos owns The Washington Post.) That said, Google also noted that the voice feature isn't yet foolproof. “We’re just getting started and we won’t be perfect,” the statement said. “We don’t recommend that users rely upon voice identification as a security feature.” Although there are benefits to having home hubs distinguish different voices, there are also some privacy implications to think about. Consumers worried about their voice data being collected in general should think twice before picking up a home hub, said Bradley Shear of the privacy-focused, Maryland-based Shear Law. With this new feature, he said, it's worth keeping in mind that Google will have even more specific information about you, which could be used in ways that consumers may not realize — particularly if it's combined with other information tied to your Google account. Consumers should also think about how this information could be used outside of the company, Shear said. He pointed to a recent murder case in Arkansas in which police asked Amazon for audio recorded from the suspect's home hub, the Echo. (Amazon fought the order before the suspect agreed to share the information.) Shear said that case illustrated how recordings made in your home may end up being used in unexpected ways. “It has a clean voiceprint from you,” Shear said, speaking of the new feature. “Once something is digitized, you don't know where it could end up.” After all, while both Google Home and Alexa devices collect voice data only when you use their respective wake phrases — “Alexa,” “Ok Google” or “Hey Google” — anyone who owns one of these devices also knows that they can sometimes trigger by accident. That opens up the potential for comments you make in private to be taken out of context or shared to an audience you never intended, particularly if the recording can be definitively identified as your voice. (Users can wipe their voice recordings from their Google accounts, per the company's privacy policy.) From a usability standpoint, there are also some problems with these hubs that identifying individuals by voice can't fix. This won't solve the “Burger King” problem of commercials being able to trigger the Google Home through your television. Anyone in range of the Google Home will still be able to use its non-personalized features. So even if you don't create an account for your guests or your children, they'll still be able to ask it to do things such as answer questions, set timers or play videos on a Chromecast. To set up the new feature, users will have to hop on to the Google Home app, which should have a new option for “multi-user” support on any Google Home connected to your network. Google Home owners can add up to six accounts, according to a company blog post. Google Home owners will have to teach the hub how to identify their voices by saying “Ok Google” and “Hey Google” twice into the device, when prompted. This allows it to learn different characteristics of each person's voice. This kind of training should be familiar to anyone who uses Siri or the voice assistant on Google's phones — the key difference being that you'll have to go through it multiple times on Home, depending on how many accounts you want to hook up. Google said it will use its network to “compare the sound of your voice to its previous analysis so we can understand if it's you speaking or not.” The company promises this should take only a few milliseconds. (Courtesy of Google) The feature is rolling out to all U.S. users starting Thursday. Google said it also plans to bring this feature to Britain in “the coming months.” business technology the-switch true Please provide a valid email address. Sign up You’re all set!

You don't have to feel guilty for running ads on your website, but make sure you do it right. Read More . Without it, the vast majority of websites would simply cease to be. And yet people are blindly using ad-blockers with no regard for the websites that rely on advertising to pay the bills. Including MakeUseOf. And now, even Google is considering adding an ad-blocker to its Chrome web browser. But this could actually be a good thing for everyone concerned. That is if the rumors are true… Blocking Bad Ads The rumors come courtesy of The Wall Street Journal, which cites “people familiar with the company’s plans”. The WSJ claims Google could “announce the feature within weeks, but it is still ironing out specific details and still could decide not to move ahead with the plan”. Google’s ad-blocker wouldn’t block everything. Instead, it would likely “filter out certain online ad types deemed to provide bad experiences for users as they move around the web”. This includes “pop-ups, auto-playing video ads with sound and ‘prestitial’ ads with countdown timers”. Essentially, Google would be trying to improve the quality of advertising for everyone using Chrome. The idea being that people don’t hate ads per se, but rather bad ads that ruin their online experience. Which is feedback we have previously heard when broaching this subject It's About Ethics in Stealing Games Journalism: Why AdBlock Needs to Die It's About Ethics in Stealing Games Journalism: Why AdBlock Needs to Die A simple, free browser plugin killed Joystiq – and is ruining the Internet.

It came down to overall performance, customization, and extensions. Read More , Chrome is the biggest web browser on the planet. If it can use the latter to change people’s minds on the former, then it would be taking control back from the ad-blockers increasingly threatening its livelihood. This is therefore a win-win for everything concerned. This is currently nothing more than hearsay based on a solitary publication. So it may come to nothing. Or Google could be on the cusp of disrupting things yet again. Lest we forget that Google I/O 2017 starts on May 17, which would surely be the perfect time to announce such a thing. Do you currently use an ad-blocker? If so, why? Do you whitelist certain websites? Or do you employ a blanket ban on advertising? What do you think of Google’s plans? Do you like the idea of an ad-blocker which filters out bad ads? Please let us know in the comments below!

Now Oculus users can pan and tilt their perspectives 360 degrees around the world in full virtual reality, whether they’re "on the ground” in Madagascar or staring down at Australia from outer space. It’s the closest that most of us will ever get to leaving the planet. This VR support is joined by three new additions to Google Earth’s capabilities. The first one, called Voyager, turns Google Earth into the interface for navigating media-rich “tours” of significant locations around the planet. Google specifically recommends checking out BBC Earth’s tour “Natural Treasures,” then getting the latest from renowned anthropologist Jane Goodall at Gombe National Park in Tanzania. And “Girl Muppets Around the World” uses Sesame Street characters to explore the world’s cultures. MORE: 9 Google Maps Features You Didn't Know About Google Earth will also get an “I’m feeling lucky” button for users who want to serendipitously browse the planet. Borrowing from the company’s famous web search button (which takes users immediately to the highest-ranked page from their search instead of displaying the search results), Google Earth’s “I’m feeling lucky” button requires no input at all — just click it to be immediately whisked away to an interesting or beautiful place. If you want to learn more about what you’re seeing, you only need click on the associated “Knowledge Card” that will break down the facts about where you are. Lastly, Google introduced a feature called “Postcards” to encourage people to share the pretty sights they might stumble across in their explorations of the company’s stitched-together aerial and satellite photography. Designate a recipient for your snapshot, and they’ll receive the image along with a link to immediately jump to the location in Google Earth. MORE: 72 Hours With Google Home This update seems to be about two things: showcasing high-quality Google Earth imagery and making its interface more explorable. Google's so committed to demonstrating that it’s building this world-sized map with the best possible pictures that it produced this eight-minute video about it.  Want More?

Photos Videos Topics Live Cricket Score Home India Mumbai Delhi World Business Technology Sports IPL Entertainment Bollywood Hollywood Television Lifestyle Education & Careers TRENDING# Sonu Nigam Vijay Mallya TTV Dinakaran Donald Trump IPL 2017 News Sci/Tech Google Home's assistant can now recognise different voices Shares1 Thu, 20 Apr 2017-10:33pm , PTI Google's voice-activated assistant can now recognise who's talking to it on Google's Home speaker. An update coming out today will enable Home's built-in assistant to learn the different voices of up to six people, although they can't all be talking to the internet-connected speaker at the same time. Distinguishing voices will allow Home to be more personal in some of its responses, depending on who triggers the assistant with the phrase, "OK Google" or "Hey Google." For instance, once Home is trained to recognise a user named Joe, the assistant will automatically be able to tell him what traffic is like on his commute, list events on his daily calendar or even play his favorite songs. Then another user named Jane could get similar information from Home, but customised for her. The ability to distinguish voices may help Home siphon sales from Amazon.com's Echo, a competing product that features its own voice-activated assistant, Alexa. The Echo doesn't yet recognise different voices, so Alexa can't retrieve more personal information for different accounts. Google's voice-distinction feature, however, won't prevent unauthorised users from activating the assistant, as long as Home's microphone is turned on. That loophole allowed Burger King to recently air a TV commercial that included the phrase "OK Google" to prompt Home's assistant to recite the ingredients of the fast-food restaurant's Whopper burger from a Wikipedia entry. Google quickly blocked Burger King's commercial from toying with the Home assistant, but the marketing stunt illustrated how the technology can be manipulated. Voice- personalisation eventually could enable Home's users to block others from accessing the device, but Google isn't ready to do that yet. "It's important to balance making sure the assistant on Google Home is still useful and able to answer a guest's or friend's question while also answering a few specific questions just for you," Google spokeswoman Kara Stockton said. The voice-distinction feature also isn't being offered for the same digital assistant that operates on Google's Pixel phone and other smartphones running on the latest version of its Android software. Google doesn't think the technology is necessary on phones because most of those devices are password-protected and are usually used by just one person.

Published on April 20, 2017. 0 The average experience when using the Google Play store is about to be overhauled as the new update seeks to make a lot of new changes to improve the user-friendliness of the service. We all know that Android smartphones more often than not get packed with all sorts of games, applications and tools. This sometimes can become both cumbersome for the phone and also for the user to manage efficiently. The applications just sit in the devices and accumulate digital dust, and as such, making us forget about the completely often over long periods of time. Despite it being a relatively trivial thing to do, most users slack off the chore of going through lengthy lists of applications in order to delete or update them. Google’s solution Google has seen to fix this issue by a sizeable update. Previously, the information was presented in the form of separate cards which has shown only the name and rating of the application. Now, with the new update, the Google Play Store has a redesigned UI with more information such as file size, last time the application was used and time of update. The card display style is similar but with much smaller and more condensed this time. The new interface will no longer make you go through various screens and taps in order to know more about your updates. Unnecessary information regarding applications has been removed from the app cards, such as developer and ratings. Besides this, an update button has been made available directly on the application card for ease of use. As well as updating individual apps, the ‘’update all’’ button now has a ‘’Refresh’’ option in order to check for potentially new updates that didn’t show up – which before this new update required you to restart the Play Store application.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile  ⋮  Software Google Accidentally Releases a “Confidential Internal Only” Update to Pixel XL By Rafia Shaikh Apr 18, 2017 23Shares Share Tweet Submit Googlers aren’t as lucky as normal customers to get polished software updates as they are often treated as guinea pigs by the company to test updates before they are released to the beta program or the public. But hey, they do get to enjoy early features so what’s there to complain about… But, when these non-stable updates somehow reach to Google customers, there is a lot to complain about especially if the said update doesn’t even bring any awesome, mind blowing, earth shattering features. Google’s Dogfood Android Security May 2017 test build accidentally released With its continued struggle to keep Googlers and customers apart, Google has inadvertently released a May 2017 security update titled “confidential Googlers-only OTA” to normal Google Pixel XL owners. Carrying the build number N2G470, the update doesn’t bring any visible changes. However, AndroidPolice reports that one tipster said he received the new Play Store UI after this update. Related Google Might Bring Its Default Ad-Blocking Feature for Chrome Browser Since Android 7.1.2 Nougat was recently released, May 2017 security release isn’t expected to bring any new features, except for regular security and performance bug fixes. Advertisement “You may use your device normally but do not discuss or comment on this update externally,” the update warns Googlers making reference to an internal “dogfood-discuss” feedback system. Too late for that, Google. Today’s reports of internal software update accidentally released to the public follow a similar story from last month when the search giant rolled out an unfinished Google Drive for Windows update, breaking Drive for several users. Last year, Nexus 6P users had also received an internal build of Android 7 Nougat ahead of its official launch.

Tech Apple Science Cars Samsung Nintendo Switch iPhone 7S & 8 Nintendo NES     Google Chrome Will Soon Block Ads Without Any Extension Posted: Apr 20 2017, 10:25am CDT | by Ahmed Humayun, in News | Technology News     Google to introduce a pre-installed adblocker in Chrome Google AdSense is one of Google’s most notorious sources of income. Which will actually make this news a surprise for our reader. According Tto WSJ Google has decided to bring in a default adblocker which will be pre-installed in Google Chrome. This adblocker will be activated by default on both, the desktop computer and mobile version of the Chrome browser. Don't Miss: Today's Best Deals on Amazon.com And since google is developing it, we are sure that it will be very good at its job. This doesn’t at all mean that Google is looking to give up its AdSense department. Rather, this is a strategy of opening another doorway of income. The adblocker developed by google will block all of the ads “except” the ones that are allowed to pass through its filters. Google right now pays the developers of AdBlock Plus to allow Google’s ads pass through the filters of the adblocker. The same power in Google’s hands will have all the ad-networks turn to Google with ton of money to allow their ads to pass through Google adblocker’s filters. Google has been very strict on the type of ads anyone can put on their website in order to be eligible of successfully creating an account on AdSense. Popups, flashing ads, ads in the middle of useful content are all unappreciated by Google. Coalition for Better Ads, an industry group with all the major ad-networks as its members, released “Better Ads Standards”. The BAS set the guidelines which will determine whether an advertisement will be unacceptable by the consumer. In short, an ad which will irritate, make the viewer uncomfortable, or constantly distract the viewer using psychologically optimized design. Moreover, if Google decides to go through with the plan (which they haven’t, for now), Google will be in control of the browsing experience of Google Chrome’s users, unless the feature is deactivated explicitly. Google Chrome is the most-used internet browser according to a report by Net Market Share, an adblocking measure by Google will bring about a huge impact on the internet.

Brian Barrett Gear Date of Publication: 04.20.17. 04.20.17 Time of Publication: 12:00 pm. 12:00 pm A Seemingly Simple Tweak Unlocks Google Home’s Full Potential Google Voice-powered speakers like Amazon Echo and Google Home have carved out a place on kitchen counters and nightstands in countless homes. What makes their immense popularity all the more remarkable is that they’ve achieved it without a key feature: Knowing exactly who’s talking. That changes with Google Home’s introduction of support for multiple accounts. Starting today, your Google Home device will be able to identify up to six distinct voices. Starting today, your Google Home device can identify as many as six voices, and summon information based on each person’s calendars, services, and preferences. In doing so, Google’s speaker-bound personal assistant becomes truly personal, unlocking the true potential of the most promising new category of consumer tech to come along in years. Oh, and it gives Google an important edge in the race with Amazon’s Alexa to own the next generation of interfaces. For now, anyway. Look Who’s Talking The benefits of a Google Home that knows you from your roommate, or significant other, borders on self-evident. The inability to match voices with identities means being unable to recognize the variety of preferences that fill any household. “There are so many services, if you think about the kinds of things an assistant should be able to help you with, that you want to be able to tailor to your experiences,” says Gummi Hafsteinsson, who leads the Google Assistant effort. In practice, this means that once you’ve linked your account, saying “OK, Google, good morning” will conjure details from your calendar and news briefing preference, rather than defaulting to those of whomever set up the device. Extrapolate a bit further, and each individual in a household can summon everything from playlists to lighting cues to commute times tied to their specific routines. These fine-tuned interactions benefit Google, too. “If Alexa or Google Home is going to develop a conversational relationship with you, it needs to be able to know who you are, which things you’ve asked for in the past, what other content and services you have access to,” says Forrester Research analyst James McQuivey. “In short, the full potential of intelligent agents can’t be realized without individual voice recognition.” In fairness, you can change user accounts on Alexa-powered devices by going into the app. (And there’s little question Amazon also is working on the sort of feature Google just announced.) But the added friction obviates much of what makes digital voice assistants so pleasant to begin with. It’s such an obvious win, in fact, it raises an obvious question: What took so long? Speech, Memory It’s not that computers can’t already tell one voice from another. They just haven’t had much reason to. “Until relatively recently, it was mostly irrelevant in terms of how the technology works,” says Brian Langner, a speech scientist at computer conversation company Pullstring. “It was usually a single microphone that tried to pick up all the various things it could, identify the speech, and figure out what the words are.” Hearing Things Tim Moynihan Alexa and Google Home Record What You Say. But What Happens to That Data? Brian Barrett Amazon Alexa Hits 10,000 Skills. Here Comes the Hard Part Tim Moynihan How to Keep Amazon Echo and Google Home From Responding to Your TV Brian Barrett Siri’s Not Even the Best iPhone Assistant Anymore Tim Moynihan Samsung’s Bixby Hopes the World Needs Another Voice Assistant Think of it in terms of dictation software. You speak, it listens and regurgitates. You don’t often see dictation by committee. Before today’s update, Google Home and Alexa applied that logic to far more complex interactions, from any number of speakers in a household. The devices continued improving their ability to know what you say, but haven’t cared much who was saying it. At most, you would expect a computer to know a single voice, and block out the rest. That served Google perfectly well on Android phones, where voice recognition allows you and you alone to unlock your device simply by asking nicely. Home presents a significantly different set of problems. “The nice thing about a phone is that it’s reasonable to assume that there’s only one person using it,” says Alex Rudnicky, a speech recognition expert at Carnegie Mellon University. “If you have something like an Echo, it’s not entirely clear who the user population is.” Ultimately, thanks to an assist from new neural networks running on the device, Hafsteinsson’s team smartened Google Home to the point that it just needs you to say “OK, Google” and “Hey, Google” twice each. With that, it knows you. Your voice also never leaves the device; Home does the identification onboard, and fetches the relevant info from Google’s servers. “It wasn’t necessarily that we couldn’t do it,” Hafsteinsson says, explaining the gap between Home’s release and the introduction of multiple accounts. “It just takes time to get the quality level that we thought was good enough.” Such concerns also informed the number of users Home can identify. Six seemed big enough to accommodate most households, without straining the device’s capabilities. That makes sense, given the difficulty of discerning and identifying too many voices—a problem even for humans. “When you start talking about constrained bandwidth situations, such as over the telephone, where you don’t have high-fidelity audio, even people are not necessarily great at identifying simply from the audio different voices that might sound somewhat similar,” says Langner. What the Google Home still doesn’t do, though, is ignore voices it doesn’t recognize to begin with. Private Little Chat Burger King sparked a flame-broiled furor recently with an ad explicitly designed to set off Google Home devices. As the camera pans in, an actor says “OK Google, what is the Whopper burger?” Because Google Home takes its commands from anyone, it would spout off the first sentence of the “Whopper burger” Wikipedia entry in response, until Google shut it down. This update wouldn’t have stopped the Burger King stunt. If another company tried it tomorrow, it would work. That’s by design; Google so far still prioritizes the ability to, say, allow dinner party guests tweak a playlist. “There’s a set of things that aren’t necessarily tied to a particular account that can still work,” says Hafsteinsson. “We’ve felt that there’s a ton of convenience about anybody being able to use those services.” Related Video The Easter Eggs Inside the ‘Mind’ of Google Home There still could be value in at least giving users the option to only let Home (or, eventually, Alexa) play nice with authorized voices. “If I have my credit card registered with Amazon, there has to be some sort of guarantee that if stuff gets ordered that the proper charging is done,” says Rudnicky. Anyone with kids knows the danger of leaving them unattended with a voice-activated birthday list fulfillment machine. There’s always the chance Google will include the ability to lock down your voice-assistant device in an update, or that Amazon will bring it to Alexa. For now, though, it’s not a big enough deal to turn you off to Google Home. Especially now that once you turn it on, your digital assistant will know just how to assist you. Go Back to Top.

Partnering with GOOGL may fix that. By Greg Gambone, InvestorPlace Contributor  |  Apr 20, 2017, 12:37 pm EDT     Popular Posts: PayPal Holdings Inc (PYPL) Hopes Partnership Will Make It the King of Mobile Payments Recent Posts: PayPal Holdings Inc (PYPL) Hopes Partnership Will Make It the King of Mobile Payments Big Tech Goes to War Over Toshiba Corp (TOSBF) Flash Memory Why Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) Stock Will Keep Jumping Higher View All Posts Earlier this week, it was announced that PayPal Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:PYPL) and Google parent company Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG) will be partnering up to integrate PayPal’s mobile payment options into Google’s NFC-enabled smartphone payment app, Android Pay. Source: Via PayPal No specific details of the arrangements were revealed, but according to Fortune, “PayPal’s chief operating officer, Bill Ready, said that his company’s partnership with Google will be implemented in the coming weeks.” Executives at both GOOGL and PYPL hope that the addition of PayPal as a funding source for Android Pay will serve to increase the number of smartphone owners who actively use Google’s digital wallet, while also making PayPal a more common choice for consumers making in-store purchases. PayPal Dominates Online, But Not In-Store For years, PYPL has led the industry; last year, PayPal processed more than 6 billion mobile transactions worth more than $350 billion. As of December 2016, PayPal held a commanding lead in the mobile payments industry, with 76% of digital wallet users reporting that they used PYPL. The second most popular digital wallet service, Amazon.com, Inc.’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) Amazon Pay, trailed PayPal by more than 50 percentage points. And, not surprisingly, the mobile payment services offered by competitors Google and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) were used by only 14% and 12% of smartphone owners, respectively. Samsung Electronic (OTCMKTS:SSNLF) sat at the bottom of the ladder with a mere 6% of users claiming to actually use the company’s digital wallet. Clearly, PayPal dominates the online payment arena. However, since the launch of Apple Pay in October 2014, and thanks to AAPL’s subsequent massive push to become the premier in-store digital payment option, PYPL has slipped to No. 2 on the list of retailers that accept digital payment methods. Undoubtedly, this was a contributing factor in the company’s decision to partner with Google. Even though Android Pay is even lower on the list, with only 24% of retailers reportedly accepting the smartphone payment service, the idea is that, together, PYPL and GOOGL stand a much better chance of overtaking Apple and gaining some meaningful market share. What This Means for PYPL and GOOGL Shareholders The partnership between PayPal and Google will likely have a more significant beneficial effect on PYPL stock than on GOOGL stock. Even though PayPal sits high atop the mobile payments mountain, shares of PYPL stock will be more greatly influenced as investors learn of the partnership arrangement. GOOGL stock, however, probably won’t react much. Interestingly, the inverse is likely to be the case with respect to consumer and retailer use and acceptance of these mobile payment services. According to Statista, 99% of online users in the U.S. are familiar with PayPal. It stands to reason, then, that Android Pay has much more potential to grow in popularity as both companies promote their new partnership. As of this writing, Greg Gambone did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Chromebook Review Chromebook vs. Laptop – Which is Right For You? Chris Stobing Updated January 12, 2017 Shares Can't decide on a Chromebook or laptop? Read our guide to find out which is right for you. Chromebooks vs. Laptops. It’s a battle that’s been raging for nearly five years now, with plenty of good points being made by those on both sides of the argument. But which portable computer is right for you, and which might hold you back? Read on to find out. Chromebook vs Laptop   Chromebook Laptop Operating System Chrome OS Linux, Windows, OS X 3rd Party Apps Allowed Highly Averse to Malware and Viruses WiFi Expandable Memory Expandable Storage Price Range Low to Medium Medium to High Operating Systems The Chrome OS is limited to Android like apps, which means 3rd party ones aren’t allowed. The three main competing laptop operating systems include OS X on Macbooks, Windows 10 on third-party laptops (Toshiba, Asus, Microsoft, etc), and Linux. Chrome OS, or in this case Chromebooks, which entered the fray not too long ago and is similar to that of Android, certainly isn’t for everyone.  However, it still serves its (limited) purpose pretty well across the board. I’ve personally used a Chromebook for two years as my road laptop, and not once has the OS ever crashed on me. There might be an occasional stutter during a 1080p video on YouTube, but otherwise the lean, mean design of the Chrome OS prevents it from experiencing any significant hangups. Windows is the exact opposite of this, of course. By this point the word “Windows” has basically become synonymous with “pulling your hair out”, and although OS X enjoyed a few years of flawless bliss when Macbooks were gaining in popularity, its reliability has since dropped quite a bit. That said, one of the main reasons both OS X and Windows have problems at all is because they support third-party software and applications, while Chrome OS does not. Last there’s Linux. Technically there are ways you can install a custom Linux build on a Chromebook, so if you’re not totally sold on Chrome OS but still want a new laptop for not a lot of money, check out this guide on which models can support the operating system swap.

The fact is Chrome OS is an extremely closed off ecosystem, one which only allows you to perform a few select functions and not much else. Google keeps their operating system secure by restricting what can be “installed” on a Chromebook, if you could even call it that. Almost all of the apps you “install” on your machine don’t actually run locally. Instead Chrome places an icon in your start menu, which is only a link to a website that supports the “program” in Flash or HTML5. The only true apps installed on the machine are the Chrome web browser, as well as offline versions of Docs, Sheets, and Google’s PowerPoint competitor, Slides. Macbooks and PCs on the other hand are made to be customized, and come with the option to install literally hundreds of thousands of different programs and types of software at once. If you need something that can run Photoshop, play your favorite games, or even run an .FLV video file, then a Windows laptop or Macbook will be the de facto choice. CPU and RAM Currently, all Chromebooks ship with Intel processors. Due to a deal inked between Google and Intel, almost all the Chromebooks released last year (and coming in 2017) are equipped with Intel processors. For the AMD faithful this may be an issue, but for most, the Intel mobile line and 5th-generation Core processors can handle Chrome OS just fine. It’s difficult to make a direct comparison of the amount of “power” you get from a Chromebook compared to a standard Windows laptop or Apple Macbook, largely because each one comes with an OS that uses its resources differently. Chrome OS is light, so it runs well on worse (less powerful) hardware.  So the comparison is a moot one. If you were to install Windows on a laptop that had identical specs it would run slower, simply for the fact that Windows has tons of extraneous processes and tasks it runs in the background while nothing else is going on. In short, Windows requires more horsepower to run, much like a big truck requires a larger engine over a smaller car. Storage One area where Chromebooks still need to catch up is with onboard storage. Because they’re made to be cheap and light, almost all Chromebooks come with an SSD opposed to a standard HDD, which ups the cost of manufacturing. As such, it’s rare to find any model of Chromebook with more than 32GB of available onboard storage. To compensate, most Chromebooks will come with 100GB of free cloud storage, provided by Google’s own Drive service. If the idea of keeping all your data on the cloud doesn’t sound like your cup of tea however, it might be better to simply go with a standard laptop instead. Laptops on the other hand come in pretty much any storage configuration you can think of. Want your operating system on an SSD and your games/movies on an HDD backup? There’s a laptop for that. Don’t mind long loading times and just want as much space as possible? There’s a 3TB hard drive just for you.  Screen The Toshiba Chromebook 2 offers an excellent screen for a Chromebook. In the pursuit of making these laptops as affordable as possible, sometimes sacrifices need to be made. Screen quality is an area where almost all Chromebooks lag woefully behind the 1366 x 768 curve, and it’s expected that unless it’s a model that specifically touts its HD-capability, you probably won’t be showing it off to your co-workers anytime soon. There are some exceptions to the rule, of course. The Toshiba Chromebook 2 was our number #1 pick of the lot for the best Chromebook 2017, a title it won in large part thanks to its absolutely 1920 x 1080 HD IPS screen. If you plan on watching a lot of Netflix or working with color-senstive creative materials online, this model is one of very few that would be able to handle it. On the laptop side of things – it’s a bit all over the place. Some laptops sport stunning 4K screens that can play Blu-Ray content at its absolute peak, while others are so grainy you can barely read a paragraph of text on them without having to adjust your glasses twice. Where touchscreens are concerned, while Windows does maintain the advantage on the sheer number of touchscreen laptops available, many of them are sub-par in quality.  Comparatively, the  ASUS Flip Chromebook made our top Chromebooks of 2017 list both for it’s solid design, and a touchscreen that responds to even the slightest graze of your finger. Keyboard and Trackpad While some Chromebooks are built as cheap as possible and come with keyboards or trackpads to match (looking at you, HP), others, like the Toshiba Chromebook 2, are an absolute dream to type on. Because Chromebooks are made as machines that can help you with work, school, or generally getting a lot of typing done, most of the keyboards on a Chromebook will do the job with flying colors. The trackpads on the other hand are a bit hit or miss. Cost-compared against Windows machines, you’re going to get a similar deal in quality. If you opt for a Macbook however, the trackpad will clearly be superior due to the increased price and money spent on the overall quality of the surrounding hardware. Webcam This one is a bit of an even draw. Chromebooks may come with some cheap components, but Google knows that of all the features that people want on a laptop, the webcam should be up to par. Comparing webcams from several of the top Chromebooks on the market right now against what you’d get in a Windows laptop or Macbook five times the cost, it’s clear that any Chromebook worth its salt will have a webcam that works in most lighting situations, even if you still can’t use it to call someone over Skype. Price Categorically, for the specs you get and the ease of use you should expect out of a device, price is where Chromebooks truly shine. Because Google doesn’t charge third-party companies for use of their OS, manufacturers can use the resources that would have otherwise been spent licensing the operating system on better specs. This means that on a direct 1:1 cost comparison, the hardware you get inside a Chromebook will always edge out what you might find in a competing Windows PC. As for Chromebooks vs. Macbooks; it’s not even a contest. Apple marks up their products by the handful compared to Google. And while a baseline 2015 Macbook Air will run you upwards of $999 at the checkout counter, a comparable Chromebook with the same specs would be nearly three times less, at $330. Read: Best Ultrabook 2017 The whole draw of Chromebooks is that they offer solid hardware at half the cost of what you’d spend on any other laptop. Although they may not have much software to speak of and their onboard storage capacities border on pitiful, you’re getting a fully-functional laptop at a discount so steep it would put lesser companies straight out of business. Which is Right for You, Chromebook or Laptop? In the war between Chromebooks vs. laptops – it looks like the winner comes down to personal preference. The only way you’ll really be able to decide if a Chromebook is right for you (or any members of your family), is to know what you’re going to use it for the most ahead of time. If you only need a machine that goes online, opens web pages, and lets you type to your heart’s content, a Chromebook is the perfect pick. If you think you might need more flexibility down the line however, it might be better to spend your cash on a Windows laptop or Macbook instead. Chrome OS is great for your kid’s first laptop or as a backup while you’re punching out the yearly expense report from an airport terminal.  But it lags behind when it comes to supporting most types of media playback, running third-party software, or gaming on the go. They’re cheap, they’re light, but they also don’t do a whole lot. If that sounds like the perfect marriage of just enough features at just a low enough price, then a Chromebook might be right for you.

Image: lili sams/mashable By Freia Lobo2017-04-20 16:43:03 UTC Google Home may finally have a solution to children "hijacking" the device to buy stuff. Google Home now supports up to six different accounts on one device and can distinguish between the voices of different users, the company announced on Thursday. It uses a specific voice as a key to share your playlists, commute time and schedule.   SEE ALSO: Need some medical advice? Try asking Alexa. One of the best parts of Google Assistant on the phone is that it is highly personalized to you. With Google Home, often being a shared device, it can be tricky to balance privacy and personalization. Ideally, the device only gives out personal details to the targeted user but still works for simple searches and requests for other users.  Image: google To set up multi-user support, users train the Assistant to recognize their voice via the Google Home app. Each user can also set up preferences with the app for features like commute and music. The Assistant uses a neural network to analyze the trigger phrases "Ok Google" and "Hey Google" to detect voice characteristics. Then, the network locally compares against those characteristics each time it picks up "Ok Google" or "Hey Google." Amazon's Echo does not yet offer support for distinguishing voices, although the company is rumored to be working on it. Voice recognition could offer much needed protection from people "hijacking" the device, whether by kids or by brands like Burger King trying to use the device for advertising. As noted by The Verge, Home cannot distinguish between work and personal accounts for the same user yet.  The feature is rolling out in the U.S. now and will expand to the UK in the coming months.

Google, according to a Wall Street Journal report, is thinking about including an ad-blocking feature in the next version of its Chrome browser. Sounds like a handy feature, right? It may indeed be a handy feature for users. But the closer you look at this news, the worse it gets. Why? Because Google isn't just any browser maker or app company—it's among the world's largest Internet companies. And how does it make the vast majority of its $90 billion in revenue? Advertising. Why on earth would one of the world's largest ad companies want to implement an ad-blocking service in its browser? Google's answer would no doubt be that it wants to get rid of the bad actors within the digital-advertising market, and ensure users have a good experience. Get Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter. This is a worthwhile goal. The web is filled with low-quality ad garbage that clutters up the page, makes websites slow to load, and weighs down the browser with popups and interstitials and other hijacking attempts. Even some ad industry executives applaud ad blocking because it forces publishers and ad networks to confront this problem. The problem is that Google is hugely conflicted when it comes to fixing this. The browser through which it plans to offer ad blocking has more than 50% of the market, and Google itself owns and operates two of the largest ad networks in the world, DoubleClick and AdSense. Presumably none of those ads would be blocked by this service. As Cornell Law professor James Grimmelmann noted in a series of tweets about the news, the prospect of Google deciding which ads are acceptable and which aren't is hugely problematic, to the point where such a service might even raise antitrust concerns. I am highly sympathetic to users who want to block ads, and to browser makers who want to help users block ads.- James Grimmelmann (@grimmelm) April 20, 2017 But Google’s triple role — as browser maker, ad-quality-standards-body-member, and advertising network — means this is a highly fraught area- James Grimmelmann (@grimmelm) April 20, 2017 If Google uses its 50%+ browser share to ship a product that blocks rivals’ ads but not Google’s own, my antitrust eyebrows go up.- James Grimmelmann (@grimmelm) April 20, 2017 According to the Wall Street Journal, decisions about which ad types would be "unacceptable" or suitable for blocking would be made by the Coalition for Better Ads, an industry group that released a set of standards earlier this year. And who created the group? Google, along with partners from the advertising and media industries including Facebook. The Journal story also says that the ad-blocking service Google is considering implementing in Chrome would not just disable the offending ads from a site that doesn't meet the group's standards, but could block all of the ads from any site that fails the test. Even if you dislike intrusive advertising, that's a scorched-earth response to the problem. And it's a response that is being meted out by one of the world's largest advertising companies, through a browser that it controls, based on standards that are being set by a group it helped create, along with several of the world's other major advertising companies. Google may not feel that it has much to worry about from an antitrust perspective, given the conservative leaning of the current administration. But that doesn't mean we should give the company carte blanche to extend its control over the online advertising market in new directions.

There are a few people (or, well, entities) you really don’t want to get in a fight with. "All nternet users" top the list. You probably also want to keep out trouble with the head honchos over at Google. And it might not be wise to mess with the managers of Wikipedia, either. Now, we can’t tell whether we’re horrified or just thoroughly impressed that Burger King managed to anger all three. Last week, the fast food chain released a commercial that intentionally interacted with the Google Home devices of at-home viewers. “OK, Google,” the actor in the ad says in a statement meant to trigger Google Home devices. “What is the Whopper burger?” https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_O54le4__I The prompt directed viewers’ devices to “read” the Wikipedia page for the Whopper, which had, at first, been favorably edited by corporate Burger King employees with an added ingredient list. (At least, that’s the word on the street after it got out that the editor in question was Wikipedia user "Fermachado123." The name of Burger King’s senior VP for global brand management is "Fernando Machado.") It wasn't long before Internet trolls joined the party, adding things like “100% medium-sized child” and “cyanide” to the ingredient list.   brightcove-video:5327144348001 Not exactly a “win” for Burger King. Just a few hours after the commercial first aired, the Google Home device mysteriously stopped getting triggered in what many believe was a retaliation effort by Google HQ. That remains unconfirmed. The more serious retaliation came from Wikipedia, who posted an open letter to Burger King on their website. “We, as editors on Wikipedia, strongly protest the actions of Burger King Corporation with respect to Wikipedia,” the group of editors wrote. “It appears from news coverage and our own investigations that Burger King employees edited Wikipedia in violation of our policies, as part of an advertising campaign authorized by Burger King management.” Related New Burger King Ad Tries to Set Off Your Google Home Kimchi Pork Burgers Roasted Veggie Burgers with Carrot Ketchup  The letter goes on to note that Burger King “not only attempted to misuse the resources offered by Wikipedia, but…wasted our time by making these measures necessary,” and that the Wikipedia team views these and other “corporate actions” in an unfavorable light. “We hope and believe that members of the public will view this incident as we do, as a cynical attempt to promote Burger King products by deception and misappropriating the property of others.” They closed by requesting that Burger King Corporation issue a public response. OK, Google: We'll just make our own burgers while we wait for all of this to pan out.

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Nat & Friends video explores how Google Earth’s 3D imagery is made By Ida Torres - April 20, 2017 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter Oftentimes, we take for granted the amazing things we see on our smartphones or computers and don’t even think about the effort and man-hours that were put into that just so we could get information from it or enjoy it. The Nat & Friends (formerly Nat & Lo) video series on YouTube shows us the behind-the-scenes magic for specific Google products. For this latest episode, they explored and learned about the meticulous artistry that goes into creating Google Earth’s 3D imagery. Google Earth announced earlier this week that they were releasing version 8.0 of the app and with it comes their best ever iteration with more interactive and more detailed explorations of places you normally would not be able to visit (probably). Nat and Lo take a look at how they were able to achieve this in an 8-minute video that is probably just a tiny portion of the scope of work that goes into it. For example, instead of just satellite images (as most of us assumed) they actually use a plane (or “Street View Cars with wings”) that flies zigzag over an area and takes various photos then stitches them together. They use advanced sensors and multi-cameras to capture the landscape of specific areas that they think would be of interest and then create the most accurate 3D model of that place. We won’t spoil the “magic” that goes into it so just watch the video. The sad news is that this is Lo’s last time to be a co-host of the YouTube series, for unspecified reasons. The two girls started this video series back in 2015 as part of their 20% Project with Google. Since they work in a really fascinating company, they decided to create videos to go behind the scenes and show people what it takes to create that app or software you’re enjoying. Thanks Lo, we learned a lot!

Google rolling out a new look for sign-in, deprecating old methods Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/04/07 8:30am PDTApr 7, 2017 27 Plus 1 on G+ 175 Share on Facebook 70 Share on Twitter Total Shares272 Development Google News Update 1: 2017/04/12 12:31am PDT Google has shared a nice GIF to show how this new sign-in process and page will look. Here it is: Starting on April 10th Google plans on pushing out an update to the sign-in page for Google accounts. This change is meant to further unify the sign-in process across your various devices. Although the news was posted to the G Suite Developers blog, we do fully expect this change to affect all Google accounts on all browsers, mobile browsers, and iOS apps (Android apps should not be affected). Google's SSO will also see additional changes beyond the purely cosmetic, as a new permissions grant redirect will be added to the login process, and permissions requested by a site or service will be more explicitly stated. The privacy-conscious will be excited to hear that Google is making such an effort to ensure a greater awareness on the part of users when it comes to privacy and consent in the use of third party services. Unfortunately, the permission request pane will no longer list what Google considers to be "standard" permission requests, presumably including basic account information. At least Google is making some effort to increase privacy awareness during login, even going so far as to increase the burden of responsibility for that privacy on developers by requiring contact information to be listed at a link on the permissions page. These aren't the only changes to login Google will be making. The use of Webview for OAuth will also be given the axe after April 20th, so if you are a developer relying on a webview redirect for OAuth to grant permissions you should consider changing to the official methods very soon before it breaks. Even some large companies like Airbnb and Pocket still haven't updated to the new methods, so it's worth taking a look. The rollout for the new sign-in is expected to be quite extended, potentially requiring more than two weeks for full visibility, so don't be surprised if you don't notice any changes to your sign-in process for a while. Most people probably won't notice much of a change beyond the cosmetic, anyway (although, our readers certainly aren't most people).

Thanks. Matt I'm sure this was first hinted at during the last Google IO... or possibly earlier. Every time I had to login since hearing that announcement I lost my shit wondering what was taking so long. Josh Crumley Of all the companies out there taking our personal data and using it for profit, Google is by far the least secretive about it. I'm glad they're making the permissions more detailed. Pixelexel I don't trust any company with my data other than Google. Kanoosh i don't even really trust google , but they are the least worst imo so i i go with them. :) HSidhu Google won't give your data to anyone, your Data is their power. Kanoosh never assume just because someone tells you something , that it is true.. i still hold plenty of caution with google as should everyone else.. no tin foil hats here, just reality of things... but i do hold them in higher regard for my personal data then any others , just always good to be safe. catalysto It's not just because "someone said so". It's because if Google was ever caught actually selling/releasing user data, they'd be completely screwed. Their entire business model depends on them keeping your data private.

Many business are not in it for the money. NooSH the only companies that are "not in it for the money" are the ones that go bankrupt and you never hear from them again.. don't ever be so naive to think a companies best interest is the consumer... it NEVER is. Portzblitz I pretty sure he/she's kidding. NooSH that's why i didn't go off with a rant instead just stuck to a more "light" reply haha.. juuuust incase. catalysto Stop spreading FUD: http://www.npr.org/sections/money/2012/06/05/154374674/not-all-businesses-are-in-it-for-the-money Nick Coad It's possible for it to be a symbiotic relationship, and I think it is with many, many companies. They treat their customers well with the knowledge that that behaviour will net them more customers. The two notions are not in conflict. mchalakov Why are you still on the internet? Your cave is waiting for you! RUN! vmxr i'll shove a stick in your fucking ass you fucking piece of shit go fuck your self if you have nothing to say fuck off Avieshek Rajkhowa Facebook's the worst, Google's the better. Summerer The 'keep me logged in' button will be removed and instead you will always stay logged in until you explicitly logout in a browser. Seems kinda insecure or at least intransparent for the average user Devin Rodriguez Honestly it's never been very effective for me anyway. Every few days I found myself having to re-enter my password and sometimes even my 2FA regardless of whether I checked the box or not. Rabia Atta they should have added speedness like bing.com....its too fastyer than google Devin Rodriguez What? Indefinite Implosion they should have added speedness like bing.com....its too fastyer than google Ryne Hager I agree, I think he was fairly clear on that point. Devin Rodriguez Oh, okay. abc But which is the fastyest? BC This is interesting and I do like the the fact that the permissions are highlighted more than they were before. This is a good thing indeed! Bikram Agarwal ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ use of Webview for OAuth will also be given the axe Thank god. I absolutely hate apps that do that for Google / Facebook / Twitter permission request. If the first party app is installed, popup permission request screen on those apps. Don't load a webview asking me to login with email, password, 2FA. I wish FB and Twitter will also do what Google is doing now. Drunk Squirrel Like how titanium backup opens a webview of Google sign in in order to backup to Google drive, as opposed to other apps which show up a single pop-up,, correct Ryne Hager Right? They've got libraries for that, why make me enter my information again on a device I'm already logged in on? Imagine all the time that could have been saved. Bikram Agarwal ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I didn't even mention "save this new browser?" screen and "logged in from a new machine" emails that those webview logins cause. I uninstall any app that uses that, no matter how good the app otherwise is. HSidhu hello @ryne Hager aka new guy :) Ryne Hager Yo! Josh Crumley Welcome to the club! HSidhu nice posts man !
