The Play Store adopts new app and notification icons with v7.8.16 [APK Download] Cody Toombs Follow View All Posts 2017/05/10 6:25pm PDTMay 10, 2017 110 Plus 1 on G+ 272 Share on Facebook 98 Share on Twitter Total Shares480 Applications Downloads News Google never stops changing things up. A new version of the Play Store app is rolling out to users and it comes with a new icons for the app launcher and notifications. They're simple cosmetic adjustments, but these are the types of things you can't help but notice as soon as they're on your screen. Left: Old version. Right: New version. The new app icon leaves behind the last remnants of the shopping bag icon that came along when Google still called this the Android Market. It is now just the Google Play logo with no other ornamentation. It's worth noting that the round icon variant hasn't changed, so it still looks like the Google Play logo on a dinner plate. Above: Old version. Below: New version. The notification icons have also gone through a little facelift. These also trade away the tote bag motif for the Google Play triangle, but slightly adjusted with the checkmark extending beyond the lines. The notification icons come in different colors for each of the content stores (e.g. apps, books, movies). The notification icon for stacked updates – when more than one app is installed or updated – is no longer a stack of blocks, it's just the same triangle app icon used with single installs. We're still looking for more changes in this update, but it's starting to look like this may be it. If you don't want to wait for Google to send this update out to you, grab it from the APK Mirror link below. Download The APK is signed by Google and upgrades your existing app. The cryptographic signature guarantees that the file is safe to install and was not tampered with in any way. Rather than wait for Google to push this download to your devices, which can take days, download and install it just like any other APK.

They are going to change play Store soon too lol Total Insecurity How do you know that? boop Unless you mean the name, the app just got another design update. sbeaulieu Isn't that the same icon from a couple of years ago? Tom Westrick We've always been at war with Eastasia Captain_Invisible Yeah.. they've used that icon on and off in promotion for a while. 4Ui812 Looks like I'll have to wait until it gets pushed. Apkmirrior won't let me download it (I don't turn off my ad blocker for anyone :-) Gjorgi Lazarovski You can download even with the adblocker on. You just need to wait like 10 sec for the download button to show up. sklatigre Can confirm Cakefish And you get to admire a cool cat. Richard Branches The play store icon on google chrome is still the old one, they should update it as well... https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/bca1aca3fd5b60e08fcd507e7c39b67f23f70ed0e4ff417bcf62881906f7106a.png Тарас Мукин Chrome apps were announced to be removed soon. Don't think they are going to bother. Richard Branches You're right about that, but they still will be available on Chrome OS so why not update it anyway?... Curt Because Google. Spazturtle Won't they be replaced in Chrome OS by Android app support? Richard Branches No, they won't... Tom Westrick If they wait long enough it'll just be back to that logo C64 Thank god / satan (choose your preference) for icon packs Konrad Krawczuk Icon packs are always kinda problem to me. If you have a few without icon from icon pack you must always fight with inconsistency. Powsniffer0110 Yes! I'm too freaking anal about this so I cannot use icon pack​s :( xyz Neither. C64 Sorry forgot the Atheist Jose Romero Google IO can't come sooner. Devin Studios Looks kinda boring compared to the old icon. Breathless So wait what happened to circles?... Cody Toombs Circles are there on the Pixel and in any other situation where the round icons are chosen. The triangle icon shows up on everything else. Anton Kuznetsov Triangles is the new circles burkett375 Since they love to A/B test, make 7 different message apps, etc....they should make 3 competing app stores/markets/hubs Ben Godfrey Don't give them any "good" ideas ;) Marcelove It doesn't matter... Google's employees are paid to keep an eye here at AP ... But it must be chimpanzees, because even with the clear feedback about stupid decisions they got here, they still don't give a f*ck and keep the screw route. Sumeet Deshmukh People who paid a lot of money to Google aren't getting these icon updates, the pixel guys mattcoz Because our icons already dropped the shopping bag, no need for an update. Sumeet Deshmukh I was a little sarcastical, I love my pixel (styled rom on my Nexus 5 (not x) Victor Stuber ya, but we got crappy white circles around all our icons. It sucks Leon I like my circles personally. sklatigre Gonna miss the shopping bag notification, kinda liked it. global etest You can keep it easily by icon packs.. sklatigre Didn't know icon packs can change the notification icons also. Margaritas Ante Porcos Google is a mess in everything. Mr. DICKHEAD it was always a mess.. Berkay Anyone else dislike both the circled icon and just the icon by itself? I prefer the shopping bag... It looks the best IMO. Thomas I loved the Android Market icon. Made so much sense SavageJeep What is Android Market? /s Salis Before Google Play branding, the app store used to he simply called Android Market. NooSH it looks like crap and i'm glad they are getting rid of it. Berkay So you prefer a simple triangle over a shopping bag? It looks horrible lol. TheDrunkenClam Completely agree. Google's whole ad campaign about Android was "be together, not the same". And then they make literally all of their icons the same by putting them in boring white circles. All in an effort to copy apple. I love the different sized and shaped icons of Android. Not a good look, Google. Jesse Kawell Once you see that notification icon "checkmark" ✅ as a 3D post lying down at an angle, you can never unsee it. BoFiS Aww, that's sad, and almost unrecognizable now since I still call mine "Market" on my homescreen... Branko Proof that Google lost the plot. reCoded So, the circle icon is the same I guess? Martin Let me read the article for you: "It's worth noting that the round icon variant hasn't changed, so it still looks like the Google Play logo on a dinner plate." Anton Kuznetsov This localization of 'update all' button text is awful https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/57e6791db8965bf1e13f4f50e3b6b5b303644e9c3f1660799bf9896ed1ef57b3.png Exalm ОМГ.

Have a nice day. thunderqus Only if I can find what you are talking about in English and posting screen in "who knows which" language. Vitias R. It says "Update your apps right today". I think that "Обновить все" is enough. Konrad Krawczuk Why it is not something like "обновить все" ? YuCMi Jesus christ Google. What sin did the previous icon commit? Was it too old for you guys? Grey Very ugly and hard to understand. Not intuitive at all. But I guess that's Google 2017! Lawstorant Looks generic af. Really Google? WTF? Maybe just go back to HOLO then? DragoCubed The new icon is nice but the icon in the notification bar isn't so nice. The one thing I don't like about losing the bag is the icon not representing a store. xyz OMG! TRIANGLE! NO CIRCLE? Like if you don't give a flying F about icon shapes. LOL I want circle, niggа! LOL New icon! Fuсk YEAH! Paul Teale Not circular then, not really following their own guidelines are they Kieron Quinn The round icon is round, the non-round icon is not. They're following their guidelines just fine Erimaru What about round icon? Curt I actually like this icon the most. Martin Spierings I already got complaints from people that didn't identify the play store or play icon with app store. So how the hell would this help people? They should realize that most people don't understand the connection google is looking for. Play is used for movies/film or games, not apps. The bag-background at least gave some indication on what to expect. The new one will get lots of people (those not really experienced with Android or mobile in general) to get their apps from there. These things should be self explanatory. And Google should drop the Play name (plus icon). Its a stupid name already. avnow well I used to get this icon pack, not exactly but close to this with an icon pack, this icon looks crisp! //moumon Meh.. I'm still using Elta icon pack :v That's one of the reason why I love android... Customize to meet your expectations <3 jcopernicus Awesome. A play button for purchases! Makes sense! Ra1nb0wD4sh DE Press Start to shut down Windows. :D (Not relevant anymore, I know) Ruben Tavano On the lateral menu the apps section was in the old green and with this update it has been updated to match the new green of the whole play store Alexander Reddicks The icon has been updated to support the new "adaptive" icon style being showcased next week. https://developer.android.com/preview/features/adaptive-icons.html Mr. DICKHEAD This is dumb theres nothing new I like the bodybag version.. but the naked one alone? seriously..?! David Onter The new icon looks HUGE next to the others. It doesn't seem to follow the spacing guidelines?

Google's executives : "Genius!” Biga173rd They can't make up their minds. madmaglio Finally. I've been replacing the bag icon with my own version of this for years. so much cleaner.

However, the suit may backfire because the Berlin court is now reviewing the law itself to determine if it is even valid. The question arose because Germany did not submit the rule for review by the EU before enacting it, violating an EU Directive. If the law is invalidated, the decision could present problems for a proposed EU-wide directive that is similar to the German rule. Germany's rule had a rough start when it was implemented in 2014. Google refused to pay fees to publishers, instead allowing them to opt in to having snippets shown. One publisher declined to opt in, but changed their mind after traffic from Google dropped 40% and traffic from Google News dropped 80%. Handelsblatt Global explains why Germany decided not to notify the EU about the draft of this law: "While typically a formality, notification reviews of national laws by Brussels can take up to two years or more. In 2013, Germany did not submit the copyright law for notification, citing a Justice Ministry argument that the law's scope was so limited, it didn't fall under the E.U.'s notification requirement." court eu google ← Related Links → Cloudflare Declares War On a Patent Troll With a $50,000 Bounty Inside Germany's Plan To Kill Online Registrations Submission: Publishers' lawsuit against Google may backfire Expiring Section 702 of FISA Helped US Conclude Russia Hacked Election To Help Trump, NSA Chief Says German Publishers' Lawsuit Against Google May Backfire More | Reply Login German Publishers' Lawsuit Against Google May Backfire Post Load All Comments  Full  Abbreviated  Hidden /Sea Score: 5 4 3 2 1 0 -1 More | Reply Login   Nickname: Password: Public Terminal Forgot your password?

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us iDevices Connected Home Products now compatible with Google Assistant By Ida Torres - May 11, 2017 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter Smart homes and devices aren’t just stuff of sci-fi and futuristic shows and movies anymore. The past years have seen various brands, devices, apps, and services becoming more available so that we can actually build that connected home we’ve always dreamed about. iDevices is one such brand in the connected home industry and their latest announcement is that their products now have support for Google Assistant, completing their compatibility trifecta for the most popular smart home platforms currently available. In fact, they may be the first or at least one of the few brands that have support for the Apple HomeKit, Amazon Alexa, and now, the addition of Google Assistant. If you are more of the Google kind of person and you have a Google Home voice-enabled speaker, then you will be able to command parts of your house, like saying “Ok Google, turn off the lights” before you go to bed. This bodes well for the brand as they are one of the pioneers when it comes to cross-platform compatibility. Some of iDevice’s newest products include the Wall Switch, Dimmer Switch, and Wall Outlet, all of which want to “integrate seamlessly and invisibly into users’ worlds.” It is also the company’s vision that these products will be updated regularly since they are “designed to evolve.” They also want to dispel the notion that having a smart home is complicated and the products that they release are simple, helpful, and ultimately useful. To set up Google Assistant for iDevices, you would first need to download the iDevices Connected app and then enable Google Assistant in the settings section of the app. Users will then have to enable the iDevices services in the Google Home app so that all available products will be linked.

News sign-up Ryanair avoids 'the Google machine' News, 12 May 2017 Topics Theories & ideas of marketing strategy LONDON: Ryanair, the low-cost airline, focuses its marketing efforts on SEO and content marketing in order to drive traffic to its website rather than higher cost activities that are open to fraud and which deliver questionable metrics, its CMO has said. "We spend nothing on Google and I am so proud of that fact," Kenny Jacobs, CMO at Ryanair, told Marketing Week. "We're the world's most searched for airline website and we spend nothing on Google because everyone knows what we stand for. It's organic traffic," he said. The notoriously frugal airline – CEO Michael O'Leary once mused about charging passengers to use the toilet – keeps a tight rein on its marketing spend and on its digital activities in order to avoid pouring money into what Jacobs described as "the Google machine" in search of quick results. He also believes that marketers need a greater amount of technical knowledge than ever before, to the extent that "they should be able to look at a website and know how that website is working: what's the code behind it. "Immerse yourself in as much as you can and retain your common sense. And marketers should treat marketing like it's their own money and be a tight bastard with it." With that view, Ryanair sets out to maximise the effectiveness of its earned and owned media, while reducing investment in paid media – and O'Leary's comments have frequently helped in boosting its earned media presence. "We're good on social," Jacobs noted. "we say controversial things, we talk to the press and we're very accessible and outspoken." A couple of years ago, the airline felt it necessary to adapt its early no-frills approach, when O'Leary admitted it should probably stop doing things "that unnecessarily piss people off". But it has no intention of changing altogether, as price remains its point of differentiation in consumer market where people are attracted to cheap brands, from Primark to Lidl to Ryanair. "We're still going to have the cheapest fares, but we're nice enough," said Jacobs. "And the word is enough, which I think is really important because short-haul flying is a functional thing, it's not an emotional thing."

Android clickjacking attacks possible from Google Play apps by Michael Heller Senior Reporter Google implemented clickjacking attack mitigations in Android, but left a potential avenue for malicious actors that won't be fixed until Android O is released.

The threat of clickjacking attacks on Android were made "significantly more difficult" by Google with Android 6.0 Marshmallow, but new research from Check Point Software Technologies, based in Waltham Mass., shows that Google didn't completely remediate the issue. The problem stems from a feature of Android that allows apps to write on top of other apps, which can lead to a number of abuses according to Liviu Arsene, senior e-threat researcher at Romania-based antimalware firm Bitdefender. "Apps that abuse the screen overlay function could trick the user into giving away sensitive information -- passwords, credentials, etc. -- by overlaying phishing screens on top of legitimate applications," Arsene told SearchSecurity. "If convincing enough, those phishing screens could be leveraged to get users to uninstall applications, remove security software, install other malicious applications, or even give away banking information, as what they would see on the screen would be manipulated by the malicious app." The Check Point Mobile Research Team noted that Google did introduce a new permission model in Android 6.0 which made it more difficult to exploit this issue, but only for apps installed outside of the Google Play Store. "Since Google understood the problematic nature of this permission, and the apparent risks for user privacy it created the distinct process mentioned above to approve it. However, this soon caused problems, as this permission is also used by legitimate apps, such as Facebook, which requires it for its Messenger chat heads feature," Check Point wrote in a blog post. "As a temporary solution, Google applied a patch in Android version 6.0.1 that allows the Play Store app to grant run-time permissions, which are later used to grant SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW permission to apps installed from the app store. This means that a malicious app downloaded directly from the app store will be automatically granted this dangerous permission." Yair Amit, CTO at Skycure, mobile security company headquartered in Palo Alto, Calif., called this "a classical trade-off between usability and security." "Google's policy to allow easier ways to use the screen overlay makes the experience of downloading and using apps that come from Google Play more streamlined, but since malware can enter into Google Play, this creates a security exposure for users," Amit told SearchSecurity. However, Amit said the Google Play Store uses "strong app analysis technology, which combines static and dynamic analysis. While it blocks, the wide variety of malware campaigns that have been uncovered in the past few years illustrates that Google's great efforts need to be supplemented by security solutions." Arsene said using this permission model does allow Google stricter control but doesn't eliminate the potential for clickjacking attacks, especially for those without access to the Google Play Store. "Google's Bouncer is not immune to falsely tagging malicious apps as legitimate. There have been numerous instances in the past when malicious applications made their way in Google Play and eventually on user devices," Arsene said. "Plus, there are plenty of third-party app marketplaces out there from where users can still download and install potentially malicious apps. And not because they're necessarily bent on using those marketplaces, but because Google Play may be restricted in their respective region and third-party marketplaces are their only choice." Check Point reached out to Google regarding clickjacking attack issues from these permissions and Google said it was working on the issue and would fix the issue in Android O. Android O will likely be shown off in beta form next week at the Google I/O conference, but the full release traditionally doesn't begin until late fall. Matthew Gardiner, cybersecurity strategist for Mimecast, said when to push a patch can be a difficult decision. "This is a typical challenge in the vulnerability patching world for application and OS developers. Patching things quickly can risk the stability of their system and patching things slowly risks further exploitation of the vulnerability by cybercriminals," Gardiner told SearchSecurity. "It's a tough call all around, but something that most developer teams wrestle with every day." Arsene worried about those who may never get the Android O update, but said there were other ways to protect against clickjacking attacks. "Having a fix only available for Android O does raise security concerns, as a large number of Android users will be left vulnerable throughout their entire lifetime," Arsene said. "However, having security software installed that's able to spot malicious applications is a great way of minimizing the risk of accidentally installing malicious apps that leverage the screen overlay function, even if these apps are downloaded from third-party marketplaces."

Google's "Fuchsia" operating system is taking shape with a new design Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/05/08 10:01am PDTMay 8, 2017 40 Plus 1 on G+ 298 Share on Facebook 95 Share on Twitter Total Shares433 Development Google News We first talked about Fuchsia, a new operating system being developed at Google, back in August (in fact, it was my first post here). At the time, there wasn't much to get excited about besides the potential - it only had a command-line interface. Now the project has a snazzy new, but clearly unfinished, interface. Summary of Fuchsia First, it's worth going over exactly what Fuchsia is, because it's been quite a while since we talked about it. As opposed to all of Google's other OSes, such as Android and Chrome OS, Fuchsia uses the company's new 'Magenta' kernel instead of Linux. According to the project's documentation, Magenta is designed for "modern phones and modern personal computers with fast processors, non-trivial amounts of ram with arbitrary peripherals doing open ended computation." Magenta's apps and the system interface are written with Google's Flutter SDK, which was initially designed to create cross-platform apps for iOS and Android. Flutter applications are written in Dart, the company's home-grown programming language. All of the system and apps are rendered by 'Escher,' which uses OpenGL or Vulkan to display everything. The 'Armadillo' interface So, on to the new stuff. Fuchsia's system UI has a new name - 'Armadillo.' Ars Technica was able to compile Armadillo into an Android APK, since it is written with the above-mentioned Flutter SDK. The interface doesn't really do anything besides looking pretty, but it does give us an idea of what the finished product could look like. The home screen is a vertical list, with a profile picture, the time, and a battery indicator in the center. Tapping the profile picture brings up something similar to Android's Quick Settings, with toggles for auto-rotate, do not disturb, Airplane Mode, and so on. Above the profile picture is the 'Story,' which the documentation describes as "a set of apps and/or modules that work together for the user to achieve a goal." Currently, this works similarly to Android's Recents screen. Users will also be able to combine stories into a 'Story Cluster.' This is what dragging a Story card into split-screen looks like. Dragging a Story card onto another one triggers a split-screen mode. The user can split an app 50/50 vertically or horizontally, drag in another app for a 33/33/33 split, or even have a tab bar appear for using all the open apps in full-screen. You can even have two apps split vertically next to two other split apps, seen below. This is far more flexible than Android's current multi-tasking functionality, but whether or not it will stay this way is uncertain. Below the profile picture is a panel resembling Google Now, with a placeholder search bar and suggestion cards. Armadillo's documentation says, "a suggestion is a representation of an action the user can take to augment an existing story or to start a new one. [The] suggestion contains enough information to create the visual representation of that concept." So maybe they will work more like an app launcher? It's hard to tell at this point. The Google Now panel, showing Fuchsia's keyboard. Keep in mind that all of this is subject to change, as the Armadillo interface (and the rest of Fuchsia OS) is still under heavy development. It's also hard to tell what Google's plans are for the operating system. Will it be neglected to Internet-of-Things devices and other basic hardware, or will it some day replace Android altogether? We'll have to wait and see.

Suicide_Note Because Google can. Corbin Davenport Ron from Ars Technica put it best: "Fuchsia really seems like a project that asks 'how would we design Android today, if we could start over?' It's a brand-new, Google-developed kernel running a brand-new, Google-developed SDK that uses a brand-new, Google-developed programming language and it's all geared to run Google's Material Design interface as quickly as possible. Google gets to dump Linux and the GPL, it can dump Java and the problems it caused with Oracle, and Google can basically insulate itself from all of Android's upstream projects and bring all the development in-house. Doing such a thing on the scale of Android today would be a massive project." makapav Would it still be open source? Also, what would happen to all the existing APKs? Corbin Davenport Fuchisa is completely open source right now. As for running Android apps, maybe Google will add some kind of stop-gap compatibility layer for running Android apps, like Chrome OS has. destinyhud read the article Suicide_Note Perhaps instead of replacing Android, this will *become* Android, as in Android P or Q? Or be the merger of Android/Chrome? m477 I could see that as Android 10. Definitely too early for P. morteum I wonder if the reason it is called "Armadillo" is because they're starting from A again, but this time they're using animals instead of desserts. Christopher Bement I think it's a smart plan, based on the guess that there's more animals to pick from in the world than tasty desserts. teolinux Ubuntu docet Paul "Tasty treats," not necessarily desserts. That said, armadillos could be a tasty treat. I won't judge. MJ I have heard desserts and candy used before which are wrong but "tasty treats" is a new one for me. To be more accurate, Android names are actually all confectionery foods. A "tasty treat" could be a slice of pizza (aka Android S). LOL Randy Gindy Armadillo is the name of the UI not the OS build itself. Matt74UK Smooth on the inside, crunchy on the outside. Armadillo ! (a few UK people of a certain age may get that). Russell Brown That bloke's a nutter... Edit: nope, that was Dime Bar. :( Nomaan Shouldnt we compare armadillo to holo/material and not to dessert names? Or am i missing something. morteum I don't think so, those are design languages and while this is a redesign of layout and function, it is still pretty much using Material Design. I could be wrong but I don't think this is closer to a build version. John Doe Idk this is a whole new OS with a new kernel, I doubt this will be done with an OTA update for Android. Mantas Pakėnas Even nowadays, some of Android's new functionality cannot be done via OTA updates (like dual system partitions, forced encryption I believe, etc). To make a completely hard cut sometime when this is ready, and if it's meant to replace Android, is not completely unimaginable. As is updating via OTA. If apple was able to change their file system via OTA, I don't see why changing most of the parts would not be possible. However, nobody aside from Google would do it, almost guaranteed :) Suicide_Note It could likely be done for Pixel devices, and possibly for future devices released after this new version of the OS rolls out. Adrian Meredith quite possibly, after all there no reason it couldn't also run android apps jonathan What they need to do is make this googles very own os for their pixel line and leave android for the oems Suicide_Note Not a chance. To much name recognition with Android for Google to drop it in favor of something else specific to the Pixel lineup. Dallas King Android Z confirmed! Suicide_Note More like Android A for Armadillo. m477 APK plz (no, really, I want a compiled apk the demo) Maxwell “Max” Weinbach https://github.com/fuchsia-mirror/sysui MJ Your link wasn't what the OP asked for... Maxwell “Max” Weinbach the only way to get the APK is to compile it yourself, so I linked to the Github page to a place to download the files to compile. The closest they will get. MJ Than you should have replied there is no known APK or not at all. Maxwell “Max” Weinbach It does not matter that much. I am building the APK right now. Once it is done I will post it. Here is the link on how to compile it. http://www.hotfixit.net/single-post/2017/05/03/How-to-build-Armadillo MJ Don't waste your time... They updated that article with an download of the APK. Maxwell “Max” Weinbach thanks. they just did that. I still compiled it myself though. I will try to get more out of it while I have the Sysui downloaded. Michel R. https://www.androidfilehost.com/?w=files&flid=178684 there you go MJ http://www.hotfixit.net/single-post/2017/05/03/How-to-build-Armadillo Latex beats nudity More of Proprietary code ? No thank you, we already had enough with this Pixel crud. I hope this OS dies quicker or become a chromebook OS. m477 It's open source. Latex beats nudity It's OSS but just like Android It'll be more heavily dependent on the google APIs to make it work. Look at the Pixel SysUI, Just being OSS doesn't make it open source... It's Google's OS not a Linux Based one. If this is going to replace Android It's doomsday on multiple levels. destinyhud billions of people dont care if its running linux kernel or not. maybe very few like u might. do iphone users care why kernel it runs. none of them care. u r just noise tbh Latex beats nudity Billions of people don't code. You are being a kool-aid joke tbh. destinyhud exaclt only few code and even on that few many dont care if it runs linux or not. look at iphone there are more dev there and yet they dont care for kernel. u r delusional in ur own world m477 Android it's already been on a Google-dependent road for years. I don't think this is going to change either way. An Angry Chihuahua https://fuchsia.googlesource.com/magenta/+/master/docs/getting_started.md heres the source code. do some research my dude WitnessG Imagining this running on a Google made processor is exciting. Badouken If this was the OS for the Pixel 2 alongside a Google made processor I think id cry! WitnessG Yeah I don't see this coming out for at least another 2-3 years. Badouken Indeed, but we can dream! ha Suicide_Note Maybe the Pixel 3 or 4 will see the dream become reality. Suicide_Note I'm betting this is what we'll see in a couple years time. As another commenter stated, starting with Armadillo could be Google's way of starting from the beginning (letter A codename), since there's more animal babes to use for each letter than there are dessert names to use.

Nomaan Armadillo should be compared to holo/material and not to dessert names. nachofrand What makes you think Google would be good at making SoCs? They're a software company and don't have the hardware expertise for hardcore ASIC development like that. Granted they can hire people, but in the end, does it matter? They're going to use ARM either way. UnlikeABoss Google fanboyism. The same reason he's excited over a brand new OS. He knows absolutely nothing about it, short of the fact that it will create more fragmentation not only in the OS space, but also the kernel space. So all we know are negative things so far. This is what we call exciting now is it? Why? Just because Google is doing it? If Microsoft made this exact same announcement, would we all be excited? Oh dear. Zsolt V No, because essentially everybody loathes Microsoft. Almost nobody's life would be worse if Microsoft vanished. marcusmarcus2 Don't they design and build their own servers to use for all their websites? Seems like those hardware work well for them. Sergii Pylypenko It's one thing to assemble the server using off-the-shelf components, or even to order a custom motherboard. It's a very different thing to design and manufacture your own chips. marcusmarcus2 I'm not saying it is the same, just that they are not only software experts. Them designing and building the servers show they do have hardware expertise that could assist them in doing the same to chips. Zsolt V Except Google's servers are not assembled from off the shelf components. Haven't been for a few years now. Roy What about TPU? Owais Lone They DO design their own chips as well especially chips meant to run specialized AI (tensoflow) code Iamsecond Anybody else think that 'Tensoflow' sounds like a brand of tampons? Adrian Vovk Samsung Exynos devices are faster than Snapdragon, iPhones seem underpowered but are extremely snappy, etc. The point is that making both the software and hardware leads to a very fast ecosystem. Also, Google are making the TPU for neural networks nachofrand Yes, as expected. Exynos is faster than Snapdragon on the Galaxy phones, but put an Exynos in another phone...oh wait, you can't. That's the whole entire point. Snapdragon SoCs are general purpose SoCs and can be used for a multitude of phones so they're not custom tuned to every phone individually. Exynos have very specific power rails and the chip is made specifically for that phone. The thing is, sure this is better, but it's marginal and hardly worth talking about. They both use the same ARM architecture so performance gains are pretty negligible. Besides that, this is how Samsung makes money....off of device sales. Google doesn't make money that way. That isn't their business model so at this point it doesn't make sense for them to build their own SoCs when they could just work closer with hardware companies. They make their own TPUs because it aligns with their business model. Adrian Vovk The instruction set doesn't really matter? I can have a 6700k and a 6500k and the 6700k will perform much better even though they are both amd64. With what Google is doing with the Pixels (still as snappy as day one here) I'm pretty sure they can optimize it further than Samsung does. They have made it run smoother in some cases on a chip that they didn't manufacture. If they made their own chip it would allow them many freedoms that they otherwise don't have = easier design of the device. I brought up the TPUs because that is experience in chip manufacturing Jason What makes you say iPhones are under powered ? Apples chips are some of the fastest around and are extremely powerful. Adrian Vovk Specs wise. They have much worse specs on paper and it would lead to a slower experience, except Apple can optimize it because they make both the chip and the OS SHunter On their Own hardware running their software in their own eco system. You cant really fairly compare it to anything else. Stephen Sharp They could use Risc-V and have to pay to license absolutely nothing, while being able to make processors purpose built for their OS Randy Gindy That would be an interesting move. Stephen Sharp Indeed, I really want Risc-V to succeed as an open ISA nachofrand They could. But in my opinion, it's unlikely. Google isn't trying to compete with Samsung and Apple in device sales and that isn't their business model. People using their services so they can show ads is their business model. It doesn't make sense for Google to make their own SoC when others are already doing a good job. Plus, if they went to RISC-V then what? What about the modem? They have to buy a standalone modem from Qualcomm or Intel. Now you have to hire system integration and test engineers to make sure the modem is working with your SoC. Oh and then you need a whole firmware team to control the modem. At that point, buy a full blown SoC with the modem on chip. Stephen Sharp Eh you lost me at "Pixel phone" and all the other hardware they sell. Google also is a Platinum member of the Risc-V foundation, and if there is a direction they are going, more control or less control, I would guess it's "more". But that's just a guess nachofrand Hardware isn't even close to the same thing as asic development. IC design is a different world. Granted they do some custom hardware, but SoCs are a much much larger feat. It's still a possibility they do so, but it doesn't make sense with their current business model imo. Randy Gindy He said nothing about ASIC he is talking about RISC-V Randy Gindy I disagree with you completely. They are penetrating the IoT market, auto market, healthcare, phones, robotics, self driving, networking, etc. Them making in house chips could really benefit every project they have. Also building an OS from the ground up to work with in house chips would be smart. Look at Apple as an example. They also may let manufacturers to use the designs. If Android One isn't evidence for them to want to standardize their platforms I don't know what is. Captain On! 1 - Google has stated that they're going to make their own silicon for the Pixels in time. 2 - Google actually owns/operates the world's most powerful quantum computer. They know how to make chips. Randy Gindy That quantum computer was built by DWave though Angel I read (somewhere don’t remember) that they have three different quantum computers systems. One from DWave and two home-produced. From those two, one was made by engineers and not that disimilar from DWave in its operations. The other was made by physicists and uses a different approach. nachofrand 1. I could be wrong, but I've only read that they plan on working closer with chip manufacturers. 2. Google didn't make that computer. Even if they did, quantum is so different those skills don't even translate. Romario Maxwell Google made their own custom ASIC called the Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) for their AI/Machine Learning needs on their cloud platform. See https://cloudplatform.googleblog.com/2016/05/Google-supercharges-machine-learning-tasks-with-custom-chip.html and https://cloudplatform.googleblog.com/2017/04/quantifying-the-performance-of-the-TPU-our-first-machine-learning-chip.html nachofrand Sure, although a TPU is just an accelerator. Think of it as the hexagon DSP inside of the Snapdragon SoC. That's like 1/10 of the entire chip. SoC design is much larger. Timothy Vreeland How many examples of hardware design do people have to point out before you stop? Sure the hardware they worked on previously isn't exactly the same... But before they started the hardware they are currently working on, they worked on previous hardware that wasn't the same as what they are doing now. They have shown they are competent in designing many kinds of hardware. Or do you suggest a company can only build one kind of hardware and nothing else for all eternity? How did Samsung make it's current in-house chips? Did they go to ARM college? Have they been making ARM chips since the dawn of time? No. They put together some teams and got to work, so stop blabbing and being negative. sweenish Their AI that finally beat the world's top Go players was running on custom Google chips. It's not like they don't know how. theProffer They have enough liquid assets to do whatever they want, abandon it, and then do it again without even noticing they spent the money. (Which is actually the source of a few of their problems, I think.) Matt Is that why they gave up on fiber? Pixelexel Imagine a Google Pixel with a Google made processor, with Fuschia, with Project Fi with Google WiFi powered by Google fiber. If I'd have this, my life would be complete. Owais Lone and all our data with it :( needa At least it is only one company getting it. Iamsecond Ha, no. A Google processor? Supported for 18 months, then replaced with a new processor that performs half as well (but has stickers.) Does not fully process Android code, because at Google one hand doesn't even know the other hand is there, let alone talk to it. Has 20 cores (only 2 enabled outside US for 'reasons.') Has a dedicated co-processor to enable ads in every app, even those that previously didn't have them. the.cyber.trekker I spit my coffee out on my monitor reading this!! ROFLMFAO! Jason Google can't even get a phone out the door without issues and you want them to make the chips too...lol. I'll pass. UnlikeABoss "In house kernel instead of Linux". Yeah, hopefully this dies in a thousand pits of fire. "Hey Linux guys, you know how you've helped us make billions over the years with a free open source kernel? Well, we were just using you to get the "nerd" userbase. Now we own the market thanks to you guys promoting its use of Linux, we will gradually phase you out." .... m477 I hope not. Linux is not really a kernel made with smartphone in minds. I don't care for being a fan of a kernel over another. UnlikeABoss Yeah. I'd much rather use a brand new untested kernel (and all the teething issues that will come with it) in my smartphone than a mature, stable one that's hacked on by hundreds and thousands of people every month. I mean, it's just a smartphone, we don't need it to be a secure environment, right? Let's just make a nice obscure kernel that no one else will use, and just say "but but it's open source!!! love us because we are Google kk". ... ihsan ışık I'm sorry but it just looks like you are a huge Linux fan and are just against change to me. UnlikeABoss Looks can be deceiving. If you're going to fling around the Linux fanboy term, i'll fling around the Google fanboy term, and that will surely be a nice constructive argument that we will both want to continue. m477 So, in 10 years we should still be using an unoptimised kernel like Linux, because anything newer is, well, newer? UnlikeABoss Yeah, because Linux hasn't changed at all in 10 years... m477 Yes, it changed a lot, and it still has many of the same problems, which are intrinsically bound to its structure. It's not a kernel well suited for mobile devices. UnlikeABoss You think the solution is to throw it out the window and start from scratch? I disagree. I'd much rather continue improving the Linux kernel, simply because of all the eyes it will always have on its code. jonathan Play nice ladies lol m477 With this mentality we wouldn't have Linux at all. Why start anything, while we can continue this other thing which purpose was completely different? A mircokenel is more well suited than a monolitic kernel to a mobile devices, both in terms of performance and security. No matter how much you improve Linux, it will never be a microkernel. UnlikeABoss Smartphones don't need a micro kernel in 2017. You could make that argument 7 years ago. Linux can be compiled with the required drivers just like it always could. m477 I made that argument 7 years ago. They always needed something different from Linux. The fact that specific, even proprietary drivers have to be integrated in the kernel (since Android lacks an abstraction layer) is on of the problems of the interaction Android-Linux. destinyhud why havent the nerds made linux on pc's a bigger market share if they were the one who made android a global leader UnlikeABoss No nerd is promoting Linux on the desktop. All social media used to be full of people promoting Android over iOS, these days there's no need to. destinyhud why havent they promoted desktop?? just wondering why they did for android but not for desktop.. linux on desktop was an underdog for decades. android was not popular because of kernal. android became popular because it was opensource and was the only viable competition to ios. people dont care what kernel it runs. UnlikeABoss No nerd worth their salt would promote an environment that would be a downgrade from Windows. Android was not a downgrade from iOS at any point in time, it had a very equal playing field. There's a difference between promoting a good solid FOSS kernel where possible, and promoting an agenda. m477 Android was not a downgrade from iOS at any point in time By this, I get that you never used Android and iOS side by side in 2009-10. UnlikeABoss You clearly value different things. The hackability alone made it an upgrade through its lifetime. m477 The same can be said for GNU/Linux on desktop. UnlikeABoss No it can't, because hackability =/= app availability. i.e. The hackability on Linux desktop doesn't make it win over it's lack of apps, where that isn't an issue on Android. m477 App availability was horrible in the early days, compared to iOS. Even Symbian had more apps. UnlikeABoss That was fine since the early days didn't consist of using your smartphone for very much, due to under powered hardware. Techies didn't go around saying "use iOS because we can all take selfies and stick filters on it". m477 iOS devices didn't have front cameras until mid 2010. The system was better, faster, smoother, the interface was coesive, there were many more apps, and the jailbreak community, to address the techie audience you like to go on about so much, was very, very good. There were tweaks and modifications that even the wildest Android custom ROM didn't have at the time. Android was objectively a downgrade, as much as Linux was on desktop. UnlikeABoss Calling jailbraik an advantage over a FOSS OS is pretty hilarious. iOS wasn't popular because it was better, it was popular because of the amount of people getting their advice from paid employees in store. "Buy iOS so we get a commission". m477 iPhone was more popular for various reasons: marketing, having 2 years of advantage, and, yes, more marketing. But it was also better than Android, as an OS. What benefit did Android bring, with it being opensource, compared to iOS, even to a "techie"? The dev community was laughable in the early days. Why GNU/Linux on desktop was not promoted by "techies" (which is false) and Android was, even if their shortcomings were identical? destinyhud u live in a dream world. even most dev dont care about kernel. what they care about the dev platform. I am a dev and i dont care for the kernel UnlikeABoss If you're talking from the perspective of an app developer then ofcourse you don't care about the kernel, you care about which platform will make you the most money... destinyhud exactly. no one care what kernel it runs.. all dev care is what platform make money. so who is this nerd who care about kernel if most dont care about the kernel.. yeah very very few.. infact rare like u UnlikeABoss Techie == Technology Enthusiast. You can sit here and tell me that you would use the best dev environment all you want but the truth is if the iOS dev environment was awful you'd still suck it up and use it to make your money. I'm not sure how you can class yourself as an enthusiast at that point. destinyhud ever wonder why no one is up voting u and upvoting many of my comments? because what u say is BS. its that simple. I am up for ditching outdated linux if the new kernal is modern and build for modern devices. most dont care for this very few techies.. i hope this becomes true and linux kernel die.. UnlikeABoss "Ever wonder why Google fanboys upvote pro Google content and not anti-Google content?" No, no I don't wonder that. How dare someone critique a pointless change by Google, causing unnecessary fragmentation. Burn them! destinyhud u must be new here.. look at anti google comments here when they make stupid changes but if they make welcome changes people tend to agree UnlikeABoss No, I've been here a long time and made many anti-Google comments as well as pro-Google. No one in the right mind would cheer on kernel fragmentation other than those that think Google can do no wrong. destinyhud open up ur comments history and let me see if u made pro google comments. i have a feeling u r a troll UnlikeABoss Yeah, this discussion is going no where. You are not the authority here and the idea that you want to browse my history to make sure I fall in line is creepy as hell. Bye. destinyhud lol i see u dont want to open ur comments history. obvious troll m477 outdated linux i hope this becomes true and linux kernel die Woah, wait a second here. Linux is not outdated, and its death would be terrible for everyone. It's just that it's not the most apt kernel for a mobile device. destinyhud maybe not outdated but not the right fit for mobile devices. destinyhud android sucked when compared to ios.. it was a downgrade compared to ios. why did dev promote android and not desktop linux? u reasoning dont even make sense. UnlikeABoss No, it wasn't a downgrade. destinyhud yes, it was back in android initial release. iOS was better and much more polished at that time. but things changed now. UnlikeABoss "Polished" is not a factor that is used to judge a better OS. There are Linux environments that are much more polished than Windows 10, but that doesn't make desktop Linux better. destinyhud it was both polished and runs better than android at that time. polished was not the only one. it was also polished. android only got better later.. i have used android at that time and it sucked big time. UnlikeABoss You are using today's standards to judge it. If you do that, they both sucked. It worked perfectly fine for the basic things people were using it for at the time. destinyhud they both sucked at that time but android sucked more than iOS at that time. SVem26 I like to think I am in the nerd userbase and I don't care what kernel is used.. can you help me understand why it matters? UnlikeABoss Do you want a brand new obscure kernel in thing that holds most of your sensitive details? TipTop I don't want something that dates back to 90s, is full of zero-days and horrible code contributed by nobodies. UnlikeABoss The idea that it is full of zero days is hilarious. You do realize that the majority of Linux exploits are local, right? Unlike Windows. Yes there is obviously code from the 90s, but very, very little of it. Not to mention that age is not a factor in deciding bad code. The idea that old code is bad code shows your inexperience. By that standard, should we dismiss Chrome because of all the exploits being found in code that was written when it first started? Are we going to create brand new software every few years to purge "old code"? Do you have any idea whatsoever how much Linux has actually changed? Do you have any idea how much of this change is because it's considered a "universal" kernel everyone can use and is focusing on? Do you really think splitting the community over onto another kernel will increase security for either of those kernels? There's a little something called code maturity. There's a reason Microsoft has way less exploits in its kernel today than 10 years ago. They didn't write a new kernel from scratch. TipTop But it is. You can be in denial all you want. Linux is the OS that is used by botnets for DDoSing websites not Windows. UnlikeABoss No sorry, come back to reality. Botnets consist of all types of OS, including Linux ofc. It is not the majority of bots in a botnet, that statement alone shows how clueless you are. Also, do you understand what Linux is? It's a kernel. The majority of Linux hosts in a botnet have been hacked through exploits in outdated software, not the kernel. The same cannot be said for Windows. Again, read the statistics for the severity of Linux exploits versus Windows. More exploits are found in Linux overall because it is open source, however, that doesn't make it worse. More critical and high severity exploits are found in Windows. That speaks a lot for the secure design of Linux. Hopefully you'll do some reading and learn. Sir_Brizz All OSes are full of vulnerabilities and horrible code written by nobodies. If that is your requirement then you must have gone full luddite by now. TipTop Windows is written by paid professionals and has QA/QC. Linux is written by fat nerds for free and has no quality control but nice try. Don't gve me the top contributors crap. Sir_Brizz Yes, tell me again how many zero day vulnerabilities are found in Windows and how long they take to get fixed. Even worse, tell me that with macOS. Being paid doesn't guarantee quality, just as being unpaid doesn't guarantee garbage. Windows and macOS have some of the crappiest insecure code. And there is nothing special about having QA or being paid to write code. Some of the worst programmers I have ever met worked at places like Microsoft and Apple. https://mobile.twitter.com/taviso/status/860681252034142208 Please continue trying to tell me how infallible paid programmers are! UnlikeABoss They are totally da bestest eva! UnlikeABoss Obviously paid products will always be better than unpaid products... right!?!? /s Oh wait we have tons of real life examples of free products being better than paid, shocking how that works. It's almost as if the best products are made by the most passionate people, and like, being paid doesn't guarantee being passionate about your creation. What a crazy crazy world! ihsan ışık Are you implying that Android got popular because of "nerds" who heard it uses the Linux kernel? UnlikeABoss If you are old enough to know the early days of android you'll know that having every single nerd on the internet promoting Android over iOS most certainly helped get the ball rolling. Once it was pushed, it snowballed into what it is today. m477 Sure. It was the nerds on the internet, not the manufacturers with ads everywhere. Most people still don't know their Galaxy runs Android. UnlikeABoss The giant billboards came YEARS afterwards, cmon. m477 Yes, and that's why Android was so unpopular in the early days. UnlikeABoss What? It was massively popular among all techies for being the open source iOS alternative. m477 You are overestimating the "techies" crowd. Even BlackBerryOS was more popular at the time. Only after the Galaxy S it started to grow, and became popular among normal people. UnlikeABoss Not really. We are talking over a decade ago now, there were far less people on the internet and it was far easier for techies to promote products because everyone was asking their "techie" friend what is best. But these days everyone is an "expert" so that's not as much of a thing. m477 Again, you overestimate how many techies there actually were. Your personal experience is anecdotal. Market shares and sell data are objective. Also, over a decade ago Android was still a camera os, and it wasn't public. UnlikeABoss No, I do not. The further back in time you go, the higher the proportion of techies there were using the internet versus others. People were only just starting to look at buying a smartphone, and asking techies what they should buy. m477 Yes, the concentration on the internet of "techies" on the internet was greater. And? What normal user at the time went to the internet, looked at reviews and said "Oh, look! The HTC magic has Linux! This random guy says its good, so I'm gonna buy it!"? You really think that a bunch of "techies">marketing? A guy saying that his toy-looking HTC G1 is better than the iPhone is more effective than billboards and tv ads? Come on, even Windows Mobile was more popular. It took Samsung's aggressive marketing to make Android popular. UnlikeABoss Windows Mobile and BlackBerry were more popular in the enterprise, that's it. The entire discussion is home users. Also I think there's been some confusion. I wasn't implying that techies on the internet were promoting Android on the internet like a marketing department. I was implying that the internet was very much a "social media" platform for techies to communicate where the majority of them would use Android and mocked the use of iOS. The actual "marketing" happened offline when a normal user would ask their "techie" friend for first time buying advice. It is nothing like that today, and the internet is nothing like the techie community it once was. m477 So, what you're saying is that the internet was a circlejerk of Android users. Ok, and? It didn't affected normal users the slightest, iOS was still more popular until Samsung took Android more seriously. The techie friend thing its only your anecdotal experience, it bears no influence on the market, in the grand scheme of things. I'd even argue that Google's very light marketing did much, much more. Also, the mindless techies that recommended half backed devices instead of better alternatives because "Uh, Linux!!" did more harm than good, both to the users and to Android. UnlikeABoss If you read my OP you'll see my original point was that Google has rode the "Android circlejerk" to popularity, and you can debate how much popularity that added as much as you want. The fact remains, it got the ball rolling. Samsung didn't pick it up "just because", it saw that a lot of people were pushing it. There were several OS at the time it could have used, including sticking to its own. Why bother with Android? Maybe because it wanted to see how much market it could take by appealing to techies? However, if you stand back and look at it, how is this any different from "embrace, extend, extinguish"? Google used that "free marketing" and has now decided to use it's massive popularity to push a different product. (Which has failed in the past and will hopefully fail again). Why hate Microsoft for doing that in the past, but we praise Google for doing it? Why are we excited for something we know nothing about that is creating fragmentation? m477 Samsung had used several OSes, it had Windows Mobile and Phone devices, Symbian devices, and proprietary devices, even Palm OS devices IIRC. They used them all. Android had was the easiest to personalise for them, and create a copy of the best selling product, which was the iPhone, and there was an app market, so they tried to release and market their flagship with it, and market it as broadly as Apple. The first Galaxy (the "non S") was was vastly ignored, because it was as little marketed as all their other devices. The techies crowd was insignificant. The free marketing is just as much as Windows 10 gets for incorporating Ubuntu's bash terminal. What you saw is not really important. I saw lots and lots of Windows Phones in 2010 and 11. Many more than Android devices. Every one I knew had one, and if I had to say which OS was the most popular only based on my personal experience, in my smallish city, I'd obviously would say Windows Phone. Why are you so attached to Linux, excluding all possibilities of giving a possibly better solution a try? The community will just fork the AOSP and continue the development of the Linux branch. UnlikeABoss Cmon, we both know Android was not easier for them to customize than simply using their own OS. No one was recommending it, techie or not, no matter how much they marketed. It's only now they are popular they are trying to slip in their own OS, and still failing. I am not attached to Linux despite people using it as an easy scapegoat to dismiss a discussion critiquing almighty Google. We currently have a situation where most kernel developers focus entirely on Linux, making it virtually the universal kernel. Why are we creating pointless fragmentation there? Why divide that community? Do we honestly believe that a divided community can produce a better kernel, or do we love it because Google is doing it? Would we love it if Microsoft did this? m477 The proprietary OS they used at the time was a Java based thing with a flash interface. Hardly able to compete against iOS. It was easier for them to use the "next Symbian" that they could customise as they wanted, and that also had an app market. If they made, say, Bada, before Android become established and popular, and marketed it as much as they did with their Galaxy S, the market would be very different today. The normal user doesn't care what OS their shiny phone runs, as long as there's facebook. I am a GNU/Linux user since the first half of the 2000s, and I've always critiqued Google for using Linux as a kernel on phones. Linux might be the universal kernel, but smartphones need a more streamlined solution. I don't care if it's Google, the MIT, or Richard Stallman in person to do it. I liked WP8 architecture. Fragmentation is not pointless if it brings benefits to the user. TipTop Nobody cares about your FSF agenda. John Q I think the chief reason Google is not using Linux is that they want a real-time OS (RTOS). Linux is at best a "soft" RTOS, possessing a real-time scheduler but this is still not nearly as real-time as an actual RTOS should be. It would take a very large effort to do that for Linux so it makes sense that Google would want to make their own kernel that they can have full control over. UnlikeABoss Let's ignore the fact that Linux is used in real time car systems for a moment. Could you elaborate on why you think Google would want/need a RTOS on their smartphones? M6 The kernel they're using, 'magenta', is opened source. So who cares if they're using linux or not? Does everyone have to use linux? UnlikeABoss No it doesn't have to be Linux. But who else will use Magenta? Probably no one. So why are we fragmenting the kernel space further? Why would you choose an immature kernel for something as valuable (your data) as your smartphone. Would you trust that? I would much rather developers continue focusing on a single kernel. WesleySmalls But wouldn't Magenta be this single kernel? UnlikeABoss If everyone decided to ditch Linux and focus purely on Magenta as the universal kernel, yes. Will that happen? WesleySmalls Could be, just not overnight. The market was already fairly well developed when Linux arrived in 1991, yet it still managed to become a very, if not the most, important player in the market. It's certainly possible, it will just require proper investment(and neglect of their alternate platforms) and patience to make it work M6 That's some straight up communist shit right there. Let's just work on one thing, because we only need one thing, everything else is redundant! Let's not allow other people to do the same thing in a different way, because competition totally doesn't spur innovation at all. WORPspeed So Andromeda definitely dead or still happening? sleepinlight Pretty sure this IS Andromeda, or at least a part of it. Andromeda was never an official name for anything, it was just the internal project name for some sort of new and/or merged OS. WORPspeed I thought Andromeda specifically referred to merging Android and Chrome OS. So is that specific merger dead or on life-support? John Q Nah, the Android/Chrome merger was just speculation from what Andromeda seemed to be. There was never any concrete evidence to imply that Andromeda was a merger. WORPspeed To quote Androidpolice : "So please, when you see Fuchsia mentioned, or speculation that it "is" Andromeda, know that it is just that: speculation. Last we heard from sources we consider extremely reliable, Android was the basis of Andromeda, and Andromeda would see its commercial debut on a new Pixel laptop later this year. It is possible Google has changed plans around Andromeda, that the initiative itself may have even been scrapped. Though, we have no reason to think so - it's more that we don't know, and haven't heard anything about Andromeda in quite some time." http://www.androidpolice.com/2017/02/15/speculation-around-googles-fuchsia-os-and-andromeda-is-creating-confusion-and-misinformation/ WORPspeed http://www.androidpolice.com/2017/02/15/speculation-around-googles-fuchsia-os-and-andromeda-is-creating-confusion-and-misinformation/ That makes them seem very separate Srujan https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/e7fda716dfcfdca76e200e51a9c9144c72e183c7e76d36b910c20ee0931aee79.gif destinyhud if this replaces android rather than having 2 separate codebase, I am all up for it. splitting the android community is dangerous senor_heisenberg Well if this does end up being what replaces Android or what Android evolves into, I just hope my apps and whatnot are compatible. Ain't got the time or money to be investing into another ecosystem. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman That's a tricky, double-edged sword. I can't fathom they would not support the old apps, or at least the vast majority of them, for exactly that reason. But in doing so it will likely be held back at least slightly from what it can/should be. Backward-compatibility tends to hold everything back. What I'd wager is we won't see this until hardware's powerful enough to make emulating the old system in a VM relatively cheap and easy, with back-end Play Store penalties to developers who don't shift to the new app models, and then slow phase-outs in stages of the older functionality and support until the new OS is running exclusively its own setup. senor_heisenberg That sounds good. Randy Gindy I think Google porting the Android Run-time to Chrome OS was to see if they could do it. morteum This is old news, I'm waiting for Fuchsia 2.0 Barracuda. /s marcusmarcus2 What if they aren't going by Animal names in general but by mammal names.

For example, had i skipped the Pixel, I'd still be using my 6P or N6, both of which have cameras that are vastly inferior to that in the Pixel. I've taken some incredible shots with the Pixel, some of which would be literally impossible to duplicate using the camera in the 6P/N6. That alone is reason enough for me to upgrade on a yearly basis. Doby Gillis Which is a problem, Einstein. Suicide_Note Not if you're a Nexus/Pixel owner, Dilbert. Randy Gindy I would generally say there is. Android phones are not supported for nearly as long as an iPhone. The reason being that the chip set manufacturers do not release new drivers. Shelly-Man Vol 2 It's looks pretty neat for a development stage. Rami Well Android has to reach Z someday.

Neither, this is just a side project many developers use to test and work out the feasability of a variety of things. Android is a very well developed environment, and replacing it whole is simply a no-go. Things will just gradually evolve, as they have already done with Dalvik being replaced by ART, for example. Sir_Brizz I don't think you're wrong, but it would be in Google's best interest to start building a non-JVM runtime that apps can run inside with a native language that Google has 100% full control over like Go or Dart.

Lol Cyber Jethro I personally think this is for embedded systems like shopping kiosks or other customer service applications.

PVL_93_RU Those "stories" on the "home screen" look like they'd fit perfectly for a kiosk-type display, where you have a lot of space to work with JG Fuchsia is a purple-y pink color. T-Mobile's color is Magenta, a slightly different purple-y pink color T-Mobile is rumored to be looking into launching their own phone... Coincidence??? Almost certainly, without a doubt yes... But consider... T-Mobile also launched the first Android phone... Nomaan Is this why Pixels were released in 2016 coz google tested fuchsia and magenta on existing pixels with existing qualcomm drivers and they know they could just update it in 2018 and further without having to worry about qualcomm dropping support? One can dream... yoloswag Inspired by the messaging team, Google wants to start working on a 2nd operating system. Darth Vader 3rd* JG Magenta is designed for "modern phones and modern personal computers with fast processors, non-trivial amounts of ram with arbitrary peripherals doing open ended computation." Modern personal computers huh? I've been interested in Google packing ChromeOS into a LiveCD type set up we could test/install on our own computers... (*Yes, I know of Chromium, haven't tried it yet... But I would prefer it coming direct from Google, faster updates and all that). It could be interesting to try out another of Google's OSs without having to fork over several hundred for new hardware... The only problem would be drivers to support the various hardware. If not modified too much, ChromeOS could possibly use the original Gentoo Linux drivers. But with Fuchsia using its own unique kernel... That might throw things off a bit... I know a few less tech-savey individuals who would probably be more comfortable if the same OS powered their phone, tablet and desktop (should Google opt to replace Android with Fuchsia). Especially if it could run both Android apps and Chrome extensions natively.

King_Android Well its safe to say its definitely for mobile phones seeing that T-mobile is the "current" carrier, so we can rule out it only being for IoT. mattcoz Phones aren't the only devices that can use mobile data. King_Android Such as a tablet? Either way it still holds true. This will obviously be used for a phone/tablet I dont know much else that uses T-mobile thats not a phone or tablet and would need a UI like this. mattcoz Tablets, wearables, vehicles, and whatever else the future brings. This is not for the devices of today, it's for the devices of tomorrow. Will that include phones? Probably, but "definitely" is too strong at this point.

Chrome Dev has a new search widget you can try out Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/05/11 8:15am PDTMay 11, 2017 3 Plus 1 on G+ 34 Share on Facebook 40 Share on Twitter Total Shares77 Applications News Google apparently thinks you don't have enough ways to search Google on your phone. On my Pixel, I have the Google search 'pill' on the home screen, and Google Assistant if I hold down on the home button or use 'OK Google.' If you have Chrome Dev, you can use a new search widget as well. All joking aside, I can see this being useful for some people. Tapping on the widget instantly opens Chrome with the address bar highlighted, so while you can use it for basic searches, you can also use it to open websites without tapping on Chrome first. And since it uses Chrome's address bar search, it will use whatever search engine you have selected in Chrome. The widget was developed as part of an anti-trust lawsuit settlement in Russia, where Yandex claimed Google had violated local competition rules. The terms of the agreement required Google to offer a search widget that could change search engines, which will replace the standard Google search widget for Russian devices. You can try this for yourself by downloading Chrome Dev (or Canary), then dragging the new 4x1 widget to the home screen. I don't think I'll ever use it, but it's there if you want it.

Eric This search widget was created from the agreement reached in the recent Russian antitrust case Ben Thanks to Russian antitrust regulators, I can finally search with Bing from my homescreen! 😆😄 Source of that information or did you forget the /s ? Eric It's real. https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/17/google-reaches-7-8-million-settlement-in-its-android-antitrust-case-in-russia/ "In addition, the agreement states that Google will develop a new Chrome widget for Android devices already being used in Russia, which will replace the standard Google search widget on the home screen and allow users to see the new “choice screen” when it’s launched." Corbin Davenport Thanks for the link, I've added it to the post. Shining Wing Oh yeah, that makes sense. AP should probably revise the article to mention that it lets you use different search providers, since that's what it's really there for. King_Android Yessss, been waiting on this search feature.... F4LL0U7 This is amazing, I've been dreaming of a Google search bar on my home screen for years. Kawshik Ahmed This is created because Google promised Russian authorities that they will let 3rd party Search Engine on Android homescreen via Google Chrome Search Widget. Willie Chalmers III Really? That's interesting. Who is this info from? Kawshik Ahmed It was on news every where few weeks ago Kawshik Ahmed The reason Google created this widget because after they lost the Anti Trust case, Google made a deal with Russian Authorities that they will let 3rd party Search Engines in Android Home Screen via new Google Chrome Search Widget. They are just keeping their promise. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/4b6cf24bff8ed22d693ebe536bd4ff92a9efe7876c5a173f1541bb6c3c429287.png https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/8929a64a1e973914b0b4b23a5cfe5f75d8e3a5727f097d81c1bef38a947cd7f8.png https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/4e993db7f9fc815e53314498ef80bdd53359a121a49fd376618b387ba98e6892.png https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/6560cec28f50ccee765f2173480161b91001ac1f2e03ab20b744e959d85a693d.png https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/664448c4b0b1f60e724477c9d5c26687e22eca14d2fa5a4ed65db0372c1305b9.png 雷安德逻 Talking about Chrome, anyone noticied the new icon on Chrome Beta?

Police filed a case under the Information Technology Act against the Internet giant and its director in Shahjahanpur on the complaint of a leader of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad, or World Hindu Council. Police superintendent Kamal Kishore told Anadolu Agency that “RK Awasthi made a complaint against Google and its director and, after investigation it was found true so we registered a case”. In 2015, Google was forced to apologize after images of Modi appeared in an image search of the “Top 10 criminals in India”. “Google has insulted our prime minister,” Awasth told Anadolu Agency. “A person who has been devoting 18 hours every day for the sake of our country can never be a stupid prime minister. I, along with other members, decided to lodge a complaint against derogatory search results”. Google in India did not respond to Anadolu Agency’s request for comment.

Google Allo now offers personalized sticker packs. The feature tasks you with taking a selfie and then the app will use neural networks and the work of artists like Lamar Abrams to create a personalized sticker pack starring you.  Google says that there are more than 563 quadrillion combinations of features that the Allo app can create. Once your illustration is generated, you can customize it further if you’d like. When you’re done, you’ll end up with 22 custom stickers that you can use inside Google Also. This feature is now rolling out to Android users, so if you’ve got Allo, keep an eye out for a new app update. Google says that personalized sticker packs will be coming to Allo on iOS soon. Allo’s new personalized sticker packs look pretty nifty. It’s cool how the app is able to combine machine learning with illustrations made by a real person to create a personalized sticker that looks like you, then give you a bunch of other stickers of yourself in different poses and with different reactions. And while the feature itself may not drive folks to use Allo if they weren’t already, this could help existing users become more attached to Allo.

News Trailers Reviews Upcoming Heroes Pop Games TV Games Google Just Bought A Major VR Studio By Ryan Winslett 9 hours ago It looks like Google is getting really interested in the virtual reality scene, recently acquiring one of the most successful developers in the business. The team over at Owlchemy Labs recently announced that they have been acquired by Google. They dished all of the details over on the company blog recently and, from the sounds of things, they're as pleased as punch by the whole thing. The mood of the update is extremely positive, with the post making it sound like Google is going to let the developers do their thing while providing additional support. In other words, if it ain't broke, don't fix it; but maybe go ahead and buy it because it's rad and likely to keep making cool games that lots of people will want to play. That's how that saying goes, right? Of course, Owlchemy didn't get their start in the VR space. They released a handful of smaller games like Snuggle Truck, Jack Lumber and Dyscourse, which earned the studio a loyal following. The roof got blown off the place once VR dropped, though, as they were pretty much first on the scene with one of the platform's biggest hits: Job Simulator. As the post explains, Owlchemy has since moved their entire focus over to VR. The studio started with just four members and has since ballooned to 23. According to their brief history lesson, the team became enamored with VR as soon as they got their hands on the new tech and immediately started working on what would become Job Simulator. They polished the hell out of the game and had it ready for the Oculus Rift, HTC Vive and PlayStation VR at launch. The secret to their success was not just that they were available on all of those platforms from day one, but that they had built a fully realized, fun game. Job Simulator has since been followed by Rick and Morty: Virtual Rick-Ality, which is another hit amongst fans and critics alike. In other words, it's no surprise they caught the eye of Google. And if you're going to invest in a developer for a new platform, you might as well back the one that's creating the most waves courtesy of quality games. While no numbers were thrown around concerning the acquisition, the team at Owlchemy are very upbeat about the shift, saying that, with Google on their team, their "plan to build awesome things will continue forward stronger than ever." This means continuing our mission to build VR for everyone, and doing all of this as the same silly Owlchemy Labs you know and love. We are continuing to do all of this with even more support and focus on building awesome stuff. It's incredibly exciting that Google and Owlchemy are so well aligned on our goals and vision for the future of VR. If Google really is letting Owlchemy Labs do what they do best, then this could mean great things for VR. I mean, what could be better than a group of talented game designers suddenly having a behemouth like Google at their back? We look forward to seeing what they come up with next.

Google Contacts 2.0 includes a cleaner UI and changes to contact management [APK Download] Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/05/11 1:53pm PDTMay 11, 2017 43 Plus 1 on G+ 106 Share on Facebook 45 Share on Twitter Total Shares194 Applications Downloads Google News The Google Contacts application really hasn't changed much over the years - after all, it just has to store contacts. Last year the app was updated with a hamburger menu and the ability to merge duplicates. Now Google has released version 2.0 of the Contacts app, with more design improvements and changes to how contacts are sorted. New design Contacts 2.0 has several minor interface tweaks all over the place, which address a few gripes I (and likely some of you) have had with the application. The actual list of contacts looks the same, but the slide-out menu now features an account switcher.    Left: Contacts 1.6; Center, Right: Contacts 2.0 Previously, the app would show all contacts from all your synced Google accounts together. Now you can easily keep contacts separate, or still combine all of them if you want. Another noticeable change is on the contacts themselves - the user icon has been reduced to a small circle instead of covering the top half of the screen.   Left: Contacts 1.6; Right: Contacts 2.0 There are a few other changes on the contact pages. The menu has removed the option to link a contact, but it has a new 'Move' item that moves contacts to another Google account. The edit button has also been moved to a floating action button. Other changes Moving on to the app settings, you can now choose which accounts to use when exporting contacts. Contacts 2.0 also supports Android O's notification channels, with a single channel called 'Notifications' (really helpful name, I know).   A quick look at the APK code reveals that this channel is used for export status notifications. I'm not really sure what the point of implementing Notification Channel support is if your app only has one kind of notification, but props to the Contacts team for getting a head start on Android O support. Finally, there is a new splash screen when you open Contacts for the first time: It basically just tells you that the app will automatically back up your contacts, which might not have been immediately obvious to people using Android for the first time. APK Download The APK is signed by Google and upgrades your existing app. The cryptographic signature guarantees that the file is safe to install and was not tampered with in any way. Rather than wait for Google to push this download to your devices, which can take days, download and install it just like any other APK.

Grey Corbin, please. You have to rip Google for this. It's inexcusable. Someone needs to put pressure on the company for their ridiculous UI beliefs. Wasted space galore, circular images for the sake of circular images. This is the peak of their insanity. We used to rip Google for their UI issues all the time. Now they are trying, but that doesn't mean we no longer criticize them. Look at this! I still remember the Nexus 4 announcement, when they introduced this version of Contacts. They praised the big, beautiful, high-res images, and the fact that the new camera could capture them. Now it's five years later and we've gone in the complete opposite direction? Please, someone at AP step up to the plate. Filipe Santos Yup, the overall changes are very good but that wasting space is so bad.... They try at least like Corbin said morteum Why are these tiny contact pictures becoming a thing? Filipe Santos People are starting to use glasses 😂😂 Jimk4003 I think it's because a lot of contact photos are low Res images synced of social media that look awful when blown up to fill half a screen. A smaller photo might not be as dramatic, but at least it isn't a pixelated mess. At least, I assume that's the thinking behind it. Corbin Davenport Yeah, blurry contact photos were a constant problem with the old design. Though, a tiny icon that takes up almost as much space isn't much better. Mochen Liu But you can change a high res photo yourself if you cam't stand it... I have high res photos for most of my contacts. Grey Blurry contact photos are only a problem if you don't care about your contact photos. And if you don't care about them, then you aren't interested in fixes. Savage Alien I remember some of this being Google's fault. A while back, before the whole Material Design era, There was inconsistent syncing between web and mobile and somehow resulted in low res version of the images being synced even when you used high res images since the servers would keep low res copies for thumb nails and things. tismondo Has this problem been fixed? It definitely happened to me - I stopped bothering managing my contact photos because I got tired of blurry versions syncing across every time I replace my phone or flash a ROM. Sashank Narayan Yes, it has since been fixed. I haven't had the issue in a few years now. Maxr1998 Well, you can of course just click the image to expand it to fullscreen, right? Right?! - Oh nevermind, it's Google, how could I forget. sigh.. EDIT: OH MY GOD, YOU ACTUALLY CAN! catalysto Actually, you can do exactly that. Maxr1998 Yeah, just found out myself. Everything ok then 😜 Willie Chalmers III At least Google followed their material design guidelines in the original layout. The newer layout is a true waste of space. PixelXLellence ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ +1 for cute doggie pic. http://livewallpaper.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/cute-dog-wallpaper12.jpg JacobTheDev I honestly prefer the old one, never had an issue with "wasted space." It's not really wasted, it's a design decision, and I think it's effective in that it treats the contact as a person and not just a bunch of random data; it helped to identify who's contact information you where looking at. I hope this doesn't affect how phone calls come in... Chris Wachtman I really prefer the old design on the left. I set decent photos for my frequent contacts, and I enjoy seeing them prominently displayed. Anyone else use the Contact homescreen widget? Alfredo Hernández Exactly, it would suck big time if they gave the Phone app the same treatment. incognito27 I wouldn't call the left one a waste of space. It actually looks nice. There is nothing wrong with it. The right one though. Ooohooo. The circular icon seems pointless. Winston This is why I like Samsung's Contacts app. It displays a tiny circle like the version 2.0 one if the image is low res, but displays a half-height full-res image like the earlier build if it has an HD one. Which you can swipe down to view in its entirety. F4LL0U7 I was hoping the Contacts app would bring in the recently-removed feature from Google+ that allows you to keep your contacts up to date, using your contacts' linked Google accounts and downloading that info into your own Contacts app. Since they removed that feature from G+, when I got a new phone I had to download an old version of G+, sync contacts, and then update G+. Another gripe I have about Contacts: every time I reset my phone, the contacts that I previously merged (before resetting) become unmerged and I have to do it all over again. Michael Tran I think it just pulls automatically now. I added a new contact and entered in their gmail and it pulled the photo automatically. The option is gone from G+ but it still did it anyway. F4LL0U7 Pulling the photo always worked, but linking with G+ pulled in all other info, like address, phone, etc. as well. Michael Tran Ah okay. I understand now. cadtek91 This also took away the ability for the phone to download your own photo for the User account photo in the quicksettings drawer. Savage Alien I've never liked having a blank user picture, and each time I wiped my phone I'd be frustrated having to remember how to get mine to show up. Always surprised this was a feature "buried" in Google+.... and now it's gone? No other way to have your google photo to show up? F4LL0U7 Can you believe that?! The only other way is to manually select a photo yourself. There doesn't seem to be any other way to pull in your Google profile pic, other than installing an old version of G+. Disqusman Yup...only realised that yesterday when I reset my Nexus 6P. Sux. I manually set a photo...but I may download an older version of G+ to get all the contacts to sync. cadtek91 Not that I know of. You could manually add the same photo but eh. F4LL0U7 I hate that! That's the main reason why I grabbed an old version of G+, so I could have my profile pic show up. Phil Worst decision ever. I see I'm not the only one who keeps an old Version of G+ around for that exactly. Downloads at APK Mirror must have gone up quite a lot :D YouNex Merging contacts has always been a mess, it never syncs properly. Just copy any additional details and remove the other doublons, keep only 1 per each contact. It's manual but more fail-proof Ben Godfrey This used to bug me too. I think if you merge contacts via the new web interface (the pretty material design one, not the old Gmail-looking one), it will sync the changes across everything. It's been a while since I've had to merge duplicates, though -- somebody let me know if this is incorrect. Carson Saldanha Finally none of those low-res, blown up contact pictures. Savage Alien Haven't had that issue in years. Carson Saldanha It's mainly with those people who use low-res pics for their Google account. Savage Alien I'd take fuzzy photo over this new design. I have maybe one low res contact photo and I picked it myself for nostalgia reasons. Cameras on phones are only getting better, too, so this isn't a great excuse to use going forward... (and even much older phone would likely take passable photos) Luzandro Haven't seen this for a long time, but even if this is a real problem for some people, there are better ways to solve it. For example I've seen a dialer/contacts app (don't recall the name) where some sort of dots effect was applied to low res images, which made them look quite nice actually roberto.elena Can the contact names still be edited using multiple fields like name prefix, first name, middle name, etc. or is it all one field now like in the new web version? Tiuri Elvander Customising which groups show up doesn't work for me. People from other groups are still shown in the list. Martins Nkem Looks like the Samsung contact app.. Good job Google Kurt Gomez Can't link contacts across accounts anymore Mochen Liu I love the yuge portrait design... why google? why?... Savage Alien Terrible design. Haven't updated my Phone Dialer app either because they made the same change to it months ago. Bewear It's... ugly. Tim Harman Can you pick which photo to use from the multiples available in a merged account? It annoys me no end I can't pick the really lovely photo of my wife, instead of just the lovely one Google picked. It used to be a feature, then it went away somewhere. Trevor Hawk They also removed the ability to customize which contacts to display in settings Corbin Davenport Are you sure? It's still there for me. Trevor Hawk Yep. It's gone for me. https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B6dKMVDga-L9MkwxZGJDUVJBLW8 Alfredo Hernández Damn, that's weird. I definitely still have it on mine. 2 Men-E I much prefer the large contact picture... whispy_snippet Same. Disqusman Agree 100% YouNex Whiter =/= cleaner, this isn't some sort of effing clothes King_Android This might the first time ever I will wait for an update to be forced upon me with a Google app. 😱 jcopernicus I can honestly say the contact portraits are great use of space. Not some soul less list of information. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/a4a682a8e0c801948117beab20317cc0df2b2d6bac2c85d9ac535412608edc9f.png Ygor Cortes The new contact page with the ridiculously small picture looks disgusting. The old one was much better. Oh Google... Ygor Cortes I'm glad that I don't use Google Contacts anymore for a while now! Timothy Bracken It looks like your blocked numbers are now part of the contacts app. Does this mean that blocked numbers are now backed up and restorable? I can't test this since I don't have a 2nd device. Grey Does Contacts have a Personal Profile yet that is stored on the web? How does Google not have that in 2017? Corbin Davenport It does if you go to settings and tap 'Your info.' Winston Being a Google app, I'm surprised it's not already on version 89.7 JG I have a cross-platform upgrade that involves Contacts I'd love to see Google make... Google made a comment about their commitment to helping improve online security [probably in an article talking about their use of HTTPS helping to encrypt the majority of web traffic]. I'd like to see them step this commitment up. They're working on a key server that's supposedly more focused on linking the key to a particular profile (to ensure the key belongs to the person claiming its theirs). I'd like to see Google launch the service. Create a new app that allows us to either create a new key or upload an existing key. Update Contacts to link to the key server database and automatically pair contacts with their corresponding public keys (if a match exists). Update Android Messages, Hangouts, Allo, GMail, et al to automatically encrypt any outgoing messages to contacts with public keys. Then even non-technical people can begin using encrypted messages. All it'd take is to download an app, tap a button or two and bam. Disqusman My God! Who made that decision to go with the tiny circular image?! The large contact picture is so much more beautiful. I really dislike how they changed the UI in the dialer to the small contact picture as well :/ ast00 The new contact page with the tiny picture and lots of wasted space is a step back. Shailesh Kumar Is it only exclusive to pixel devices? How can I have this on my moto x style? Daan Smit Guys, I am just not able to display contacts from a number of Google contact groups and my outlook contacts.

Opinion: Even if you can, you probably shouldn't buy a Google Pixel anymore David Ruddock Follow View All Posts 2017/05/01 2:09pm PDTMay 1, 2017 107 Plus 1 on G+ 378 Share on Facebook 105 Share on Twitter Total Shares590 Editorials Pixel Pixel XL The Google Pixel is a notoriously hard phone to get a hold of. Persistent stock issues have plagued Google's first "in-house" handset from day one, and things really are little to no better six months after the launch event. Honestly, it's a bit embarrassing just how consistently incompetent Google seems to be at keeping a reasonable inventory of phones available for purchase. But setting that aside, as one of the Pixel's most ardent evangelists, I think there's something it's probably time for me to come clean on: Even if you could buy a Pixel today, I really think you shouldn't. The Pixel is a product with generation-one product issues. The Bluetooth performance is horrid. It's not waterproof. The bezels really are due for a shrink. I don't think the exterior coating on the black and blue variants is of a particularly high quality. The glass window gets scuffed up incredibly easily. The Snapdragon 821 is officially old news. And it doesn't support proper advanced network features across all four of the big US carriers. There are other flaws I could point to, and while none of them are too terrible, they do speak to the slightly-rushed development cycle this phone seems to have been subjected to. Sure, Google got some things astoundingly right: the performance, the camera, the larger software experience. In fact, I think the Pixel is easily the best Android smartphone ever for these strengths, at least if we're talking about me personally as a user (your mileage, obviously, may vary). But for all the great, smooth, fast, clean, pure, simple, natural, and various other adjective-members singing in the Pixel-praise cavalcade, this phone is not the one to buy right now. For starters, Google continues to ask what is an increasingly laughable amount of money for the model most of us want - the 128GB XL - at a staggering $870. Sure, Apple charges the same for an iPhone 7 Plus 128GB, but I'm under no illusion that this comparison in any way favors Google. The iPhone comes with Apple customer service (with actual stores), a longer software support period going forward, and runs no real risk of poor resale value. The Pixel? Google's online support is iffy at best, we know the phone will be unsupported by October 2018, and I have a strong feeling generation-one Pixel resale values will drop like a rock once the new phones are announced. And that really is why, if you haven't pulled the trigger on a Pixel yet, you should just wait. It's overpriced, under-supported, and competing phones like the Galaxy S8 offer a whole lot more technology for your money. The Galaxy S8+ is $20 less than a 128GB Pixel XL, and I would argue it is far and away the better smartphone value. That amazing display, brand-new Snapdragon 835 processor, jaw-dropping design and packaging, and the full support of all our American carriers' latest LTE advancements could each be a reason on its own to put the Galaxy S8 above Google's smartphone. Do I still prefer using the Pixel over the S8? Sure. But I wouldn't buy a 128GB Pixel XL over a Galaxy S8+ today. That would be, frankly, a bit silly. If Google was asking $670 and not $870, the discussion would probably change, but they aren't. You've got to pay full price, and there's no way I could recommend anyone do that. If you're still on the fence about the Pixel, let me try to push you over: wait for the next generation. I realize that this sort of thinking can devolve into a rationale that encourages you to never upgrade anything because something newer, faster, and better is constantly on the horizon. But in this case, I think it's a consideration that is worth weighing more seriously than usual. Many of the Pixel's biggest flaws relate to Google's inexperience producing a smartphone. Issues that only come up as you try to mass-produce and distribute a product with a real marketing campaign that creates real demand, and the phone gets into the hands of "real" users who aren't part of the now-derailed Nexus phone hypetrain. Inside Google, expectations were no doubt managed, realities realized, and priorities accordingly re-calibrated after this first launch. (Side note: if the Bluetooth performance on the next Pixel is as bad as the first one, I may scream, Google.) Meanwhile, the things that make the Pixel great aren't going anywhere. The next Pixel will be fast, it will take great photos, and it will offer a wonderfully unfettered Android experience. Those that make it less than great? Google is no doubt drilling down through the worst of them in order to ensure the Pixel 2 - or whatever it's called - won't make the same mistakes that the original did (waterproofing, please). And one of the primary reasons to try the Pixel in the first place - to be on the very bleeding edge - really only remains true from a software standpoint. Older phones like the Nexus 5X and 6P don't even let the Pixel have an advantage there, as they're on the same update track until around the time the next Pixel phones launch. If you absolutely need a smartphone soon and the Pixel is tempting you, ask yourself this: Can you deal with a Moto G5 Plus for six months if it means having a better Pixel down the road? While as a reviewer I have the admitted luxury of not needing to consider such things, were I in such a position, I'd have little in the way of a counterargument to offer. Sure, you'll take a resale hit on anything you buy now, but the Pixel is going to face a much, much steeper devaluation curve in that time than any budget phone. Buying a Pixel right now just doesn't make sense. I love my Pixel XL, but I'm officially done recommending the phone to friends and relatives. Instead, I'll tell them to wait, or to get the Galaxy S8 they were probably going to buy anyway. Tags editorial google pixel google pixel xl opinion pixel xl subscribe ...

What's wrong with it? I haven't really noticed issues on my 128 non XL. I still love my phone but I understand if someone was switching now, they should just wait for the new one. I probably will. Patruns The XL is too large for me. No wireless charging is a game stopper for me. $650+ is just too much to pay as I buy my phones outright for my wife and myself. We are still happily using our Nexus 5 phones until something of roughly the same dimensions with QI charging comes out that won't break the bank. Also, I want pure Android. Not interested in Touchwiz or any other skins. Rod So, I found another proud N5 owner! I'm in my third battery, nothing to complain about. YuCMi I skipped this generation, was too salty about Google's treatment of Nexus devices. If they make their next phone reasonably priced, then I'll consider it. Otherwise, Google can fuck off with their "premium" pricing. CW The OnePlus 3T is a great phone at a great price! Laura J. Sellers Hughes I bought my Google Pixel XL for the camera. I have not been disappointed! https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/c44fd1bc546c27c02f945b075e0388e076c62e0fd612b3c74442129a05446139.jpg https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/c4618b9d22a1d44186f347c184038b3a833f38a1148cc4b91b95981303fa8b6b.jpg https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/465d23a781688e73e20a0737904c3880ee693ee06b5dd1779ae91d9799b0488b.jpg https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/1f3d76182fdd59b34eda695d20943d03e71240b775f63106ef41809601a7cabf.jpg https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/66175dfb8d6503940dc945b8d865f4f8276c84f7f3abd0e0e46dc31136501275.jpg https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/f7fa8ed860bc28a3a3e377a7e74591e764bdec5795747c4a1afb93eaa44aa0b2.jpg Rod You shouldn't. It's the best camera in a smartphone currently. Even the S8 was left behind in image quality. Aj Wayans Nothing wrong with my Pixel, best phone I've ever had. Only has scratches because I've dropped it a few times Rod Impossible. Pixel is horrid, every single owner has an urge to throw it onto the nearest wall. WNDRKND I hear ya, but I got pixel for Christmas. And back then, there was no new Samsung phone. Personally, the optimization alone makes the phone worth it... Like, I've literally had no problems. Even the speaker issue, Bluetooth, whatever. My handset works perfect, even for a first generation device. Either way, I'll be waiting for pixel three and skipping pixel 2 this Christmas. Rod I think you're 4 months late. Lol WNDRKND Haha perhaps, but with nobody able to get one... I still feel 9 months early lmao! Rod First rule of the Pixel club: no one talks about the club Hussain Ahmadi Pixel is an indie phone, like indie films with limited screens and very much less public appeal, no matter how good it is it will always be just a side phone. The only true big sharks in the market are Samsung and Apple. Google is not able to compete with them erikz The main reason I wanted the Pixel was to get on Google Fi. ackthbbft I think there are still good reasons to go with the Pixel, even if it means waiting for gen 2. I went with the Pixel because I wanted to get on Project Fi and "pure" Android. As a former Samsung Galaxy S5 user (S2 before that), I got tired of both carrier-installed and OEM bloatware, plus I've been saving money on my plan. Tj Hariharan Frankly I'm considering an LG-G6... comes with assistant, near stock android from what I've been told and my little experience with in-store demo's...AND iirc: an SD Card. Rod Then, when Google drops Android 8, you'll infuriated asking LG where your OTA is. gparmar76 Google will charge the same price with Pixel 2. They have a proven track record with the Nexus phones... roseglace >The Bluetooth performance is horrid. so? bluetooth is not everything to everyone. in particular, i've used it on my pixel exactly once. a non-issue. > It's not waterproof. i'll remember not to take my phone into the shower. another non-issue. > The bezels really are due for a shrink. the bezels i can't see with the phone in its case? > I don't think the exterior coating on the black and blue variants is of a >particularly high quality. the coating i can't see with the phone in its case? > The glass window gets scuffed up incredibly easily. there's that case in the way again. darn. > And it doesn't support proper advanced network features across all four >of the big US carriers. such as? maybe i'd worry if i lived in the united states but i bought the phone for phone calls, SMS and wifi. are those 'advanced'? they work in canada. > the model most of us want - the 128GB XL is there a shred of evidence that 'most' of 'us' want it? if it was the exact same price as the 16GB version i'd want it. if it was even twenty bucks more? umm, probably not. i know it's labelled 'opinion' and everything, but could you try a _little_ harder not to sound like you're whining? John Pitkethly I got a Pixel in December and have none of the problems listed in this article. Jordan Bartholme Great article, thank you! thereasoner If fast updates and performance are your thing than it's never a bad time to buy a Pixel but if one must wait then I guess the Pixel 2 is not that far off. Don't care about stock Android performance and updates? Then there are more choices coming still besides Samsung. I personally am looking forward to the HTC U 11 in a couple of weeks time. geolemon Good points. Even still, the worst point is that it's a metal (stupid) and glass (downright silly) wannabe iPhone (including all the hardware limitations we all hate Apple for) to try to pull the "Apple demographic" stereotype as a customer - people who want a jewelry phone rather than a functional, practical tool. Sadly, few alternatives exist today, if you want high end specs. How far we've fallen in just a few years. Hopefully it's something to just ride out - high end phones that fit in front trouser pockets and have swappable batteries, sd cards, and the durability of polycarbonate replacing the impact vulnerability of metal will reappear. But certainly - the Pixel is one of the more vulgar offerings. Sad, because I was otherwise a satisfied customer on Google Fi. Mike Dealbreaker on the Pixel 2 could be whether or not Google include unlimited full resolution Photos & Video BackUp like they have with the Pixel 1. If they don't & just throw in something like the S8's increased 100K Play Music songs limit instead, we just might hold on to our Pixel XL 128 a little longer instead. Like all hardware, it's what you do with it that really matters, but without the software to achieve it with... You just pays your money & you takes your choice. Notpoliticalyet Mate 9 is my Pixel XL. Easy to get one and top end specs. I have had all the Nexus phones and passed up the Pixel. I may look at the 2nd generation but they need to fix their supply chain. No reason to wait long with all of the good competition out there. They also created hype with limited availability. Get it right Google. Kimwo Good read! I've HATED my Pixel from day one! I tried to fall in love with it but I haven't! My husband made me do an upgrade and of course it was when this dumb a*$ ph came out! I sent my Samsung GalaxyS5 in as was required for rebate to get the Pixel. The camera sucks butt, I don't know what all the hype was about! I thought I'd like the fact it has unlimited storage but how is that useful if you can't get a good quality photo!!!! I think Androids are way better, and easy to use. That's all I've had sense the iPhone 4! Wouldn't go back to an iPhone but would take it over a Pixel any day!!😝 Christopher Hopkins First off who ever made this post is just a glorified iPhone fan and downing the Google pixel I've had mine since launch and so have the 3 others on my account and all of us can say nothing has gone wrong with my pixel not once so get off your high horse and the back glass part of my phone is not scratched still and this is the same phone since launch same with my GF her brother and my best friend on my account Stanced Imports What a joke review I've had a Google pixel since January this phone is the best phone I've ever had, and I've had a iPhone 7😂 if you can't afford it that's not a reason to not buy it, that's a choice the consumer should make not a reflection on the phones performance 😁 I live in Canada so my Google pixel is about 1000$ and it's worth every penny Stanced Imports Also I find it's nice that the phones availability is scarce so I don't look at everyone and they all have the same phone. vitriolix "unsupported by October 2018" That's wrong, they will still get security patches until Oct 2019. Still too short, but let's not warp the facts MikeOxlong Nobody cares what Ruddock thinks.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Mobile Try out Chrome’s new ultra fast search tool for Android before the rest of the world Mike Wehner @MikeWehner May 11th, 2017 at 5:31 PM Share Tweet After caving to pressure from Russian regulators regarding Android, Google is hard at work tweaking its mobile operating system and web browser so that they mesh with the country’s requirements. The Chrome web browser on Android will allow users to swap out Google search for something else if they want, and as part of the agreement the company reached with the Russian government, a new search widget has to be rolled out to all Android devices sold in Russia. But in an apparent effort to make the prospect of switching from Chrome as unappealing as possible, the new widget is undoubtedly the fastest way to perform a web search from an Android device. You can try it out now and see for yourself. Don't Miss: Reliable leaker claims to reveal iPhone 8 launch timing, and it’s not what we’re expecting On your Android phone, download Chrome Dev and add its new search widget to your home screen. The widget, which is really nothing more than a search bar, looks rather dull and boring, but it’s lightning-quick. Tap the widget and a Chrome search opens instantly, complete with the features you expect from Chrome, like autofill based on recent searches and quick links to most visited sites. When used side by side with the current built-in Google search function on Android it’s abundantly clear that this new widget is just plain faster, which makes it arguably the best search option you can get on Android right now. The reason regulators demanded the widget be created is that, for Russian users of Android, the new search feature will produce a selection screen that allows them to choose between various web browsers including one from Russia’s own Yandex. It’s unclear what, if any, bonus options will be rolled out worldwide with the new widget, but for the moment it’s already worth your attention.

Today, Allo got a really exciting feature that will turn all your selfies into cartoon stickers. The update confirms how popular emojis have become, especially when we chat with our loves ones. According to Fast Co Design, Google is using machine learning to make Allo more exciting to users. “Today, Google is introducing a feature in Allo that uses a combination of neural networks and the work of artists to turn your selfie into a personalized sticker pack. Simply snap a selfie, and it’ll return an automatically generated illustrated version of you, on the fly, with customization options to help you personalize the stickers even further,” Jennifer Daniel, Expressions Creative Director, Allo wrote in a blog post. The method will involve using machine learning and neural networks to map out your facial features to animated versions designed by popular artist Lamar Abrams, a storyboard artist, writer, and designer for the popular Cartoon Network series Steven Universe. Once designed, you can then go ahead to customize the cartoon stickers to suit your taste. Credit: https://research.googleblog.com/2017/05/neural-network-generated-illustrations.html?m=1 The whole idea behind the new feature is explained in details by Google on its research blog. Google’s approach will be to first explore how it could enable an algorithm to pick out some basic features in a particular manner from your image. The new tool, which is already being rolled out by Google, is integrated into the Allo chat app. You can locate the feature when you pull up the list of stickers you can use to respond to conversations where you will find an option: “Turn a selfie into stickers.” Once you tap this option, it prompts you to take a selfie. From there and then, Google’s image-recognition algorithms will analyze your face, and map out your features to the ones in a kit as illustrated by Lamar Abrams. Credit: https://research.googleblog.com/2017/05/neural-network-generated-illustrations.html?m=1 In April, report surfaced online that Google would soon be adding some new features to Allo. According to 9to5google, Google is “actively” working on a number of features including a quick selfie button, ability to add stickers as decoration on photos, and backup and restore. Today’s update all but confirms that earlier report, and goes to show how highly Google rates the chat app. Google recently updated Allo with some more stickers to give you more options when it comes to making your conversations more interesting. Last November to be precise, the company added refreshed Smart Smiley button and interchangeable background themes for chats. Built on Allo’s prediction algorithm, the Smart Smiley button suggests emoji and stickers relevant to what you are typing. It will also be able to interpret your conversations, which makes the chat app more fun to use. The Smart Smiley will also be integrated with Allo’s one-tap replies, enabling you to respond to messages with contextual emoji in a jiffy. Got something to add to this story?

But wouldn’t it be great if you could translate your own features rather than settling for a rough approximation? Google’s newest Allo feature is here to do just that by turning user selfies into emoji. Machine learning technology — which is beginning to more closely mimic human learning — is behind the new feature on Google chat app Allo that translates selfies into wild illustrations. In its Thursday exclusive, Fast Company reported the feature is now accessible when users pull up the stickers function to respond to a message. Google Allo trumps SnapChat with new selfie feature. https://t.co/ef3sUuxpu2 pic.twitter.com/AV0zMwQyVv &mdash; Mark Stronge (@markoftec) May 11, 2017 After users have taken their selfie, Google’s ML tech will analyze the photo and translate facial features and turning them into illustrations Lamar Abrams, a designer for the Cartoon Network series “Steven Universe.” Fast Company reported that “ literally hundreds of eyes and noses and face shapes and hairstyles and glasses available.” Google reportedly estimates that there are 563 quadrillion faces that could be generated by the feature. After the app generates an emoji from the selfie, users can tweak individual features until they’re satisfied with the face. Then, the feature will generate 22 custom stickers using the design, Fast Company reported. Read: New Emojis 2017: 69 Characters Revealed Ahead Of Summer Release The tool reportedly started as an internal research project to see if ML could translate a selfie into a cartoon. “How do you make something that doesn’t just convey what you look like but how you want to project yourself?” Jason Cornwell, Google's Communications UX Lead, asked Fast Company. “That’s an interesting problem.

Google Contacts 2.0 includes a cleaner UI and changes to contact management [APK Download] Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/05/11 1:53pm PDTMay 11, 2017 43 Plus 1 on G+ 106 Share on Facebook 45 Share on Twitter Total Shares194 Applications Downloads Google News The Google Contacts application really hasn't changed much over the years - after all, it just has to store contacts. Last year the app was updated with a hamburger menu and the ability to merge duplicates. Now Google has released version 2.0 of the Contacts app, with more design improvements and changes to how contacts are sorted. New design Contacts 2.0 has several minor interface tweaks all over the place, which address a few gripes I (and likely some of you) have had with the application. The actual list of contacts looks the same, but the slide-out menu now features an account switcher.    Left: Contacts 1.6; Center, Right: Contacts 2.0 Previously, the app would show all contacts from all your synced Google accounts together. Now you can easily keep contacts separate, or still combine all of them if you want. Another noticeable change is on the contacts themselves - the user icon has been reduced to a small circle instead of covering the top half of the screen.   Left: Contacts 1.6; Right: Contacts 2.0 There are a few other changes on the contact pages. The menu has removed the option to link a contact, but it has a new 'Move' item that moves contacts to another Google account. The edit button has also been moved to a floating action button. Other changes Moving on to the app settings, you can now choose which accounts to use when exporting contacts. Contacts 2.0 also supports Android O's notification channels, with a single channel called 'Notifications' (really helpful name, I know).   A quick look at the APK code reveals that this channel is used for export status notifications. I'm not really sure what the point of implementing Notification Channel support is if your app only has one kind of notification, but props to the Contacts team for getting a head start on Android O support. Finally, there is a new splash screen when you open Contacts for the first time: It basically just tells you that the app will automatically back up your contacts, which might not have been immediately obvious to people using Android for the first time. APK Download The APK is signed by Google and upgrades your existing app. The cryptographic signature guarantees that the file is safe to install and was not tampered with in any way. Rather than wait for Google to push this download to your devices, which can take days, download and install it just like any other APK.

It's not really wasted, it's a design decision, and I think it's effective in that it treats the contact as a person and not just a bunch of random data; it helped to identify who's contact information you where looking at. I hope this doesn't affect how phone calls come in... Chris Wachtman I really prefer the old design on the left. I set decent photos for my frequent contacts, and I enjoy seeing them prominently displayed. Anyone else use the Contact homescreen widget? Alfredo Hernández Exactly, it would suck big time if they gave the Phone app the same treatment. incognito27 I wouldn't call the left one a waste of space. It actually looks nice. There is nothing wrong with it. The right one though. Ooohooo. The circular icon seems pointless. Winston This is why I like Samsung's Contacts app. It displays a tiny circle like the version 2.0 one if the image is low res, but displays a half-height full-res image like the earlier build if it has an HD one. Which you can swipe down to view in its entirety. F4LL0U7 I was hoping the Contacts app would bring in the recently-removed feature from Google+ that allows you to keep your contacts up to date, using your contacts' linked Google accounts and downloading that info into your own Contacts app. Since they removed that feature from G+, when I got a new phone I had to download an old version of G+, sync contacts, and then update G+. Another gripe I have about Contacts: every time I reset my phone, the contacts that I previously merged (before resetting) become unmerged and I have to do it all over again. Michael Tran I think it just pulls automatically now. I added a new contact and entered in their gmail and it pulled the photo automatically. The option is gone from G+ but it still did it anyway. F4LL0U7 Pulling the photo always worked, but linking with G+ pulled in all other info, like address, phone, etc. as well. Michael Tran Ah okay. I understand now. cadtek91 This also took away the ability for the phone to download your own photo for the User account photo in the quicksettings drawer. Savage Alien I've never liked having a blank user picture, and each time I wiped my phone I'd be frustrated having to remember how to get mine to show up. Always surprised this was a feature "buried" in Google+.... and now it's gone? No other way to have your google photo to show up? F4LL0U7 Can you believe that?! The only other way is to manually select a photo yourself. There doesn't seem to be any other way to pull in your Google profile pic, other than installing an old version of G+. Disqusman Yup...only realised that yesterday when I reset my Nexus 6P. Sux. I manually set a photo...but I may download an older version of G+ to get all the contacts to sync. cadtek91 Not that I know of. You could manually add the same photo but eh. F4LL0U7 I hate that! That's the main reason why I grabbed an old version of G+, so I could have my profile pic show up. Phil Worst decision ever. I see I'm not the only one who keeps an old Version of G+ around for that exactly. Downloads at APK Mirror must have gone up quite a lot :D YouNex Merging contacts has always been a mess, it never syncs properly. Just copy any additional details and remove the other doublons, keep only 1 per each contact. It's manual but more fail-proof Ben Godfrey This used to bug me too. I think if you merge contacts via the new web interface (the pretty material design one, not the old Gmail-looking one), it will sync the changes across everything. It's been a while since I've had to merge duplicates, though -- somebody let me know if this is incorrect. Carson Saldanha Finally none of those low-res, blown up contact pictures. Savage Alien Haven't had that issue in years. Carson Saldanha It's mainly with those people who use low-res pics for their Google account. Savage Alien I'd take fuzzy photo over this new design. I have maybe one low res contact photo and I picked it myself for nostalgia reasons. Cameras on phones are only getting better, too, so this isn't a great excuse to use going forward... (and even much older phone would likely take passable photos) Luzandro Haven't seen this for a long time, but even if this is a real problem for some people, there are better ways to solve it. For example I've seen a dialer/contacts app (don't recall the name) where some sort of dots effect was applied to low res images, which made them look quite nice actually roberto.elena Can the contact names still be edited using multiple fields like name prefix, first name, middle name, etc. or is it all one field now like in the new web version? Tiuri Elvander Customising which groups show up doesn't work for me. People from other groups are still shown in the list. Martins Nkem Looks like the Samsung contact app.. Good job Google Kurt Gomez Can't link contacts across accounts anymore Mochen Liu I love the yuge portrait design... why google? why?... Savage Alien Terrible design. Haven't updated my Phone Dialer app either because they made the same change to it months ago. Bewear It's... ugly. Tim Harman Can you pick which photo to use from the multiples available in a merged account? It annoys me no end I can't pick the really lovely photo of my wife, instead of just the lovely one Google picked. It used to be a feature, then it went away somewhere. Trevor Hawk They also removed the ability to customize which contacts to display in settings Corbin Davenport Are you sure? It's still there for me. Trevor Hawk Yep. It's gone for me. https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B6dKMVDga-L9MkwxZGJDUVJBLW8 Alfredo Hernández Damn, that's weird. I definitely still have it on mine. 2 Men-E I much prefer the large contact picture... whispy_snippet Same. Disqusman Agree 100% YouNex Whiter =/= cleaner, this isn't some sort of effing clothes King_Android This might the first time ever I will wait for an update to be forced upon me with a Google app. 😱 jcopernicus I can honestly say the contact portraits are great use of space. Not some soul less list of information. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/a4a682a8e0c801948117beab20317cc0df2b2d6bac2c85d9ac535412608edc9f.png Ygor Cortes The new contact page with the ridiculously small picture looks disgusting. The old one was much better. Oh Google... Ygor Cortes I'm glad that I don't use Google Contacts anymore for a while now! Timothy Bracken It looks like your blocked numbers are now part of the contacts app. Does this mean that blocked numbers are now backed up and restorable? I can't test this since I don't have a 2nd device. Grey Does Contacts have a Personal Profile yet that is stored on the web? How does Google not have that in 2017? Corbin Davenport It does if you go to settings and tap 'Your info.' Winston Being a Google app, I'm surprised it's not already on version 89.7 JG I have a cross-platform upgrade that involves Contacts I'd love to see Google make... Google made a comment about their commitment to helping improve online security [probably in an article talking about their use of HTTPS helping to encrypt the majority of web traffic]. I'd like to see them step this commitment up. They're working on a key server that's supposedly more focused on linking the key to a particular profile (to ensure the key belongs to the person claiming its theirs). I'd like to see Google launch the service. Create a new app that allows us to either create a new key or upload an existing key. Update Contacts to link to the key server database and automatically pair contacts with their corresponding public keys (if a match exists). Update Android Messages, Hangouts, Allo, GMail, et al to automatically encrypt any outgoing messages to contacts with public keys. Then even non-technical people can begin using encrypted messages. All it'd take is to download an app, tap a button or two and bam. Disqusman My God! Who made that decision to go with the tiny circular image?! The large contact picture is so much more beautiful. I really dislike how they changed the UI in the dialer to the small contact picture as well :/ ast00 The new contact page with the tiny picture and lots of wasted space is a step back. Shailesh Kumar Is it only exclusive to pixel devices? How can I have this on my moto x style? Daan Smit Guys, I am just not able to display contacts from a number of Google contact groups and my outlook contacts. I can only see my outlook contacts if I either opt for viewing all candidates or only outlook contacts. This also happens on the standard OnePlus3t contacts app. It used to work on Marshmallow though. Is this an Android issue?

Google Contacts 2.0 includes a cleaner UI and changes to contact management [APK Download] Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/05/11 1:53pm PDTMay 11, 2017 43 Plus 1 on G+ 106 Share on Facebook 45 Share on Twitter Total Shares194 Applications Downloads Google News The Google Contacts application really hasn't changed much over the years - after all, it just has to store contacts. Last year the app was updated with a hamburger menu and the ability to merge duplicates. Now Google has released version 2.0 of the Contacts app, with more design improvements and changes to how contacts are sorted. New design Contacts 2.0 has several minor interface tweaks all over the place, which address a few gripes I (and likely some of you) have had with the application. The actual list of contacts looks the same, but the slide-out menu now features an account switcher.    Left: Contacts 1.6; Center, Right: Contacts 2.0 Previously, the app would show all contacts from all your synced Google accounts together. Now you can easily keep contacts separate, or still combine all of them if you want. Another noticeable change is on the contacts themselves - the user icon has been reduced to a small circle instead of covering the top half of the screen.   Left: Contacts 1.6; Right: Contacts 2.0 There are a few other changes on the contact pages. The menu has removed the option to link a contact, but it has a new 'Move' item that moves contacts to another Google account. The edit button has also been moved to a floating action button. Other changes Moving on to the app settings, you can now choose which accounts to use when exporting contacts. Contacts 2.0 also supports Android O's notification channels, with a single channel called 'Notifications' (really helpful name, I know).   A quick look at the APK code reveals that this channel is used for export status notifications. I'm not really sure what the point of implementing Notification Channel support is if your app only has one kind of notification, but props to the Contacts team for getting a head start on Android O support. Finally, there is a new splash screen when you open Contacts for the first time: It basically just tells you that the app will automatically back up your contacts, which might not have been immediately obvious to people using Android for the first time. APK Download The APK is signed by Google and upgrades your existing app. The cryptographic signature guarantees that the file is safe to install and was not tampered with in any way. Rather than wait for Google to push this download to your devices, which can take days, download and install it just like any other APK.

I manually set a photo...but I may download an older version of G+ to get all the contacts to sync. cadtek91 Not that I know of. You could manually add the same photo but eh. F4LL0U7 I hate that! That's the main reason why I grabbed an old version of G+, so I could have my profile pic show up. Phil Worst decision ever. I see I'm not the only one who keeps an old Version of G+ around for that exactly. Downloads at APK Mirror must have gone up quite a lot :D YouNex Merging contacts has always been a mess, it never syncs properly. Just copy any additional details and remove the other doublons, keep only 1 per each contact. It's manual but more fail-proof Ben Godfrey This used to bug me too. I think if you merge contacts via the new web interface (the pretty material design one, not the old Gmail-looking one), it will sync the changes across everything. It's been a while since I've had to merge duplicates, though -- somebody let me know if this is incorrect. Carson Saldanha Finally none of those low-res, blown up contact pictures. Savage Alien Haven't had that issue in years. Carson Saldanha It's mainly with those people who use low-res pics for their Google account. Savage Alien I'd take fuzzy photo over this new design. I have maybe one low res contact photo and I picked it myself for nostalgia reasons. Cameras on phones are only getting better, too, so this isn't a great excuse to use going forward... (and even much older phone would likely take passable photos) Luzandro Haven't seen this for a long time, but even if this is a real problem for some people, there are better ways to solve it. For example I've seen a dialer/contacts app (don't recall the name) where some sort of dots effect was applied to low res images, which made them look quite nice actually roberto.elena Can the contact names still be edited using multiple fields like name prefix, first name, middle name, etc. or is it all one field now like in the new web version? Tiuri Elvander Customising which groups show up doesn't work for me. People from other groups are still shown in the list. Martins Nkem Looks like the Samsung contact app.. Good job Google Kurt Gomez Can't link contacts across accounts anymore Mochen Liu I love the yuge portrait design... why google? why?... Savage Alien Terrible design. Haven't updated my Phone Dialer app either because they made the same change to it months ago. Bewear It's... ugly. Tim Harman Can you pick which photo to use from the multiples available in a merged account? It annoys me no end I can't pick the really lovely photo of my wife, instead of just the lovely one Google picked. It used to be a feature, then it went away somewhere. Trevor Hawk They also removed the ability to customize which contacts to display in settings Corbin Davenport Are you sure? It's still there for me. Trevor Hawk Yep. It's gone for me. https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B6dKMVDga-L9MkwxZGJDUVJBLW8 Alfredo Hernández Damn, that's weird. I definitely still have it on mine. 2 Men-E I much prefer the large contact picture... whispy_snippet Same. Disqusman Agree 100% YouNex Whiter =/= cleaner, this isn't some sort of effing clothes King_Android This might the first time ever I will wait for an update to be forced upon me with a Google app. 😱 jcopernicus I can honestly say the contact portraits are great use of space. Not some soul less list of information. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/a4a682a8e0c801948117beab20317cc0df2b2d6bac2c85d9ac535412608edc9f.png Ygor Cortes The new contact page with the ridiculously small picture looks disgusting. The old one was much better. Oh Google... Ygor Cortes I'm glad that I don't use Google Contacts anymore for a while now! Timothy Bracken It looks like your blocked numbers are now part of the contacts app. Does this mean that blocked numbers are now backed up and restorable? I can't test this since I don't have a 2nd device. Grey Does Contacts have a Personal Profile yet that is stored on the web? How does Google not have that in 2017? Corbin Davenport It does if you go to settings and tap 'Your info.' Winston Being a Google app, I'm surprised it's not already on version 89.7 JG I have a cross-platform upgrade that involves Contacts I'd love to see Google make... Google made a comment about their commitment to helping improve online security [probably in an article talking about their use of HTTPS helping to encrypt the majority of web traffic]. I'd like to see them step this commitment up. They're working on a key server that's supposedly more focused on linking the key to a particular profile (to ensure the key belongs to the person claiming its theirs). I'd like to see Google launch the service. Create a new app that allows us to either create a new key or upload an existing key. Update Contacts to link to the key server database and automatically pair contacts with their corresponding public keys (if a match exists). Update Android Messages, Hangouts, Allo, GMail, et al to automatically encrypt any outgoing messages to contacts with public keys. Then even non-technical people can begin using encrypted messages. All it'd take is to download an app, tap a button or two and bam. Disqusman My God! Who made that decision to go with the tiny circular image?! The large contact picture is so much more beautiful. I really dislike how they changed the UI in the dialer to the small contact picture as well :/ ast00 The new contact page with the tiny picture and lots of wasted space is a step back. Shailesh Kumar Is it only exclusive to pixel devices? How can I have this on my moto x style? Daan Smit Guys, I am just not able to display contacts from a number of Google contact groups and my outlook contacts. I can only see my outlook contacts if I either opt for viewing all candidates or only outlook contacts. This also happens on the standard OnePlus3t contacts app. It used to work on Marshmallow though. Is this an Android issue?

Former Google Fiber Executive to Join Frontier Communications (Photo: Business Wire) Download Small Preview Thumbnail ???pagination.previous??? ???pagination.next??? (Photo: Business Wire) Small Preview Thumbnail Full Size Small Preview Thumbnail May 11, 2017 04:45 PM Eastern Daylight Time NORWALK, Conn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Frontier Communications Corporation (NASDAQ:FTR) today announced that Chris Levendos, former head of the Network Deployment and Operations organization at Google Fiber, will join the company as Executive Vice President, Field Operations. His predecessor in the position, John Lass, plans to retire. Levendos will report to President and Chief Executive Officer Dan McCarthy and serve as a member of the Senior Leadership Team. Levendos will focus on better serving customer needs by maximizing the effectiveness of Frontier’s robust fiber-optic and copper networks to expand reach and increase speed capabilities. His experience at Google Fiber, where he led network planning, expansion, design, and operations for fiber-to-the-home infrastructure, and at Verizon, as a Region President and as Vice President in the Wireline Transformation group, give him keen insight into the opportunities within Frontier’s operations in 29 states. Dan McCarthy stated, “I am confident Chris will further enhance the robust resources of our field operations teams and our network assets, allowing Frontier to continue to provide the bandwidth options that support advanced technology and connectivity. We remain focused on providing homes and small, medium and commercial businesses with technologies that will help us lead in our markets, scale wisely, and create seamless network experiences.” Before joining Google, Levendos spent 26 years at Verizon, last serving as region president for its New York City wireline operations. He began his career with Verizon in 1989 and held positions with increasing operational and engineering responsibility. He led the massive restoration of Verizon’s network infrastructure in lower Manhattan that was destroyed in Superstorm Sandy. His knowledge and expertise was critical to the network upgrade to fiber and the restoration of services in record time. Levendos is a graduate of the State University of New York at Plattsburgh and earned a Master’s degree in Urban Planning from New York University and a Master’s degree in Telecommunications Management from Stevens Institute of Technology. About Frontier Communications Frontier Communications Corporation (NASDAQ: FTR) is a leader in providing communications services to urban, suburban, and rural communities in 29 states.

Google Suggests Leading Holocaust Denier May 11, 2017 By Josh Nathan-Kazis Getty Images David Irving Share Facebook Twitter Pinterest Email At times in the course of the Jewish news business, one needs to get in touch with a Holocaust historian. Some days you know just which Holocaust historian to call. Other days your brain farts out, and you flail through the web until you turn up the right phone number. Today was one of those farty days, so I typed “holocaust historian” into Google. Google had lots of suggestions. Its first? David Irving. First face to pop up when you google “holocaust historian”? Holocaust denier David Irving. pic.twitter.com/28E51dtdvW— Josh Nathan-Kazis (@joshnathankazis) May 11, 2017 David Irving is certainly a Holocaust historian, I guess. But mostly, he’s “antisemitic and racist,” as an English judge once called him, and a leading denier of the Holocaust. He was even jailed in Austria for more than year for Holocaust denial, which is a crime there. The search turns up plenty of Holocaust historians with sterling records, as well — Deborah Lipstadt, the former Forward columnist who Irving once sued for calling him a Holocaust denier, is the second result. I think I’ll call her instead. Contact Josh Nathan-Kazis at nathankazis@forward.com or on Twitter, @joshnathankazis. Share This: Recommend this article Looking For A Holocaust Historian?

There are a handful of good ways to protect yourself against these attacks: Choosing a strong administrator password Installing a plugin that guards against brute force logins, such All in One WP Security or BruteProtect Changing the default wp-admin url with a plugin such as HC Custom URL However, I prefer to use a two-factor authentication method that requires a code from my phone to complete the login process. Google’s Authenticator has been gaining ground as a mobile app for providing secure codes. In fact, you may already have the Google Authenticator app on your phone, as a number of web services are now integrating with it, including cloud file store provider Dropbox, cloud hosting provider Digital Ocean, and name service provider Gandi.net. And, fortunately, there is a simple WordPress plugin by Henrik Schack that integrates with Google 2fa; it’s also called Google Authenticator. Installing and using this plugin is quite easy—and the security benefit is significant. This tutorial will walk you through setting up the Google Authenticator WordPress plugin for your own sites. Installing the Google Authenticator Plugin From your WordPress Dashboard, go to install a new plugin and search for Google Authenticator, and click Install Now: Then, click Activate Plugin: From the dashboard, click Users > Your Profile and scroll down to the Google Authenticator settings: Click on the checkbox for Active. Modify the description so that you will recognize the site on your Google Authenticator mobile app and show the QR code. Note that the plugin works for multiple users—and each user has the choice of enabling it for themselves. Adding Your Site to the Mobile Authenticator App From your mobile Google Authenticator App, click the upper right pen (for editing). Click the plus sign at the bottom for adding a site. Choose to scan the barcode and point your camera at the QR code. The process is quite fast. Log out of your WordPress site and you should see the additional field for Google Authenticator on your login screen! To log in, enter your username and password as usual, but visit your Google Authenticator mobile app to get the additional code for logging in. The codes are time-critical and expire every few minutes. Congratulations, you’ve successfully implemented two-factor authentication on your WordPress site. Troubleshooting In writing this tutorial, I was accidentally logged out of my site before I had registered my site with the mobile app. I couldn’t log back in—but luckily, there is a simple solution listed on the plugin support page. I just had to log in via SSH to my server and change the name of the plugin folder temporarily. Then, I logged back into WordPress, reset the plugin folder name, added my site on my mobile app, and I was good to go. Another way to do this is through the database using a tool such as PHPMyAdminand these queries. If you’re not self-hosting, you may need to request help from your hosting company. In Closing I hope you’ve found this useful; now go secure your WordPress sites. Please post any comments, corrections or additional ideas below.

As Google explains, “[Allo] will return an automatically generated illustrated version of you, on the fly, with customization options to help you personalize the stickers even further.” Sadly, it doesn’t appear these personalized stickers are usable outside of Allo, but maybe that could change in the future. If you’re interested in learning how Google created this, you can read its blog by following the link below. It details staying away from the uncanny valley, the hypothesis that human replicas which appear almost, but not exactly, like real human beings can feel repulsive. Very interesting stuff.

The inside story of its insanely ambitious plan to built virtual worlds, change the way we make decisions, and maybe one day build the Matrix. By Oliver Franklin-Wallis 1 day ago James Day/WIRED By Oliver Franklin-Wallis Thursday 11 May 2017 On a bright, clear morning in February 2017, a motley group of high-powered individuals from the entertainment, policy and security industries gathered on the Warner Brothers lot in Burbank, California. In the middle of the 25-hectare plot, surrounded by large warehouse sets, lies a ghost town: broad streets and pavements, a library, a bank, salon, shopfronts. The buildings are sets for Hollywood films (most recently, 2017’s La La Land). It’s New York, at some point in the recent past, on the outskirts of Los Angeles. The subway stairs descend into nothing. The group – which included the president of a major animation studio, the director of a world-famous superhero franchise, British MPs and senior military staff from both the US and UK – had gathered for a two-day private event held by British startup Improbable. The set was a nod to the theme, “Virtual Worlds” – not virtual reality, with its cumbersome headsets, but rather alternate realities: simulations. ADVERTISEMENT Inside one artificial edifice, Herman Narula, Improbable’s co-founder and CEO, addressed the group. “We’re in a place today where it is actually possible to create artificial realities,” he said. “Not in some abstract sense, but genuine, living, breathing recreations of this one, powered by technology, that allow people to have totally new experiences.” Narula has a boyish face, scruffily cropped hair and stubble; he has the energy levels of a small nuclear reactor, and speaks faster than most people think. “AI gets all the press,” he said, but, “this idea of recreating reality is going to become something in the public consciousness that’s as important, as significant, as artificial intelligence.” READ NEXT Improbable's SpatialOS is an operating system for simulated cities Improbable's SpatialOS is an operating system for simulated cities By Oliver Franklin-Wallis "AI gets all the press," he said, but "This idea is going to be as important, as significant, as artificial intelligence" Improbable has yet to reach the profile of British startups like the AI company DeepMind (now a division of Google), but its ambitions are just as lofty. It has raised more than $540 million (£421m) in funding from venture-capital firms including SoftBank, Horizons Ventures and Andreessen Horowitz. It has partnered with Google worldwide, and counts the UK and US defence departments among its clients. In May 2017, the company joined the select few British tech startups valued at over $1billion. Improbable’s platform, SpatialOS, is designed to let anyone build massive agent-based simulations, running in the cloud: imagine Minecraft with thousands of players in the same space, or researchers creating simulated cities to model the behaviour of millions. Its ultimate goal: to create totally immersive, persistent virtual worlds, and in doing so, change how we make decisions. ADVERTISEMENT READ NEXT Exterminate most robots, and an unstoppable breed will emerge Exterminate most robots, and an unstoppable breed will emerge By Liat Clark Or more simply, as Narula often jokes, “Basically, we want to build the Matrix.” Improbable founder and CEO Herman Narula James Day/WIRED Data is old news. By its nature, it tells us about things that have already happened. So to make decisions about the future, industries from engineering to bioscience still turn to simulation. ADVERTISEMENT READ NEXT Mars scientists leave dome after 8 months isolation Mars scientists leave dome after 8 months isolation By Daniel Culpan Broadly speaking, simulations are digital recreations – approximations, really – of reality. All video games are, to an extent, simulations, whether explicitly (Euro Truck Simulator 2) or implicitly (the parody Los Angeles of Grand Theft Auto V). Large, detailed simulations require vast amounts of computing power. So rather than, for example, simulating all the traffic lights in a city, transport researchers might simulate a single junction or route. (While you can A/B test your app design, if you build a motorway in the wrong place, it’s tricky to move it later.) But that itself is still expensive and limited, particularly when studying, for example,the emergent, messy effects that occur with enough moving parts. Imagine a London street during rush hour. There’s a collision in the road; with the lanes blocked, traffic backs up. As drivers divert, other routes start to become clogged. A few kilometres back, a queue starts to form on the motorway. Drivers, cursing under their breath, call in to work to cancel their morning meetings, overloading the nearby cellular towers. Deliveries are delayed; in the hospital, an ambulance is redirected, meaning another patient faces a longer wait for medical attention. Right now, simulating that kind of emergent complexity is impossible, but it’s exactly what Improbable wants to be able to recreate. As Narula explains: “The really interesting things happen at scale.” READ NEXT Goat Simulator nails Dead Island trailer parody Goat Simulator nails Dead Island trailer parody By Philippa Warr It’s a few weeks before the LA event, and Narula and Rob Whitehead, the company’s co-founder and chief technology officer, are sitting in Improbable’s London office. On the ground floor of a Farringdon mid-rise, cheap MDF desks compete to hold the most monitors. The company is growing quickly – in February, it opened a San Francisco office – and, each time I visit, the space has sprouted a new meeting pod. On a whiteboard in one conference room, Narula and Whitehead sketch out SpatialOS. In a video game, our imaginary London street might be made up of “Entities”. “An entity represents a thing, like a noun. In a city simulation, your entities would be every traffic signal, every segment of road, every building, every pedestrian, every car,” Whitehead says. Entities have states, called “Components” (a car may have fuel; it may be On Fire, or Not). Components are governed by “Systems”, such as physics, which interact with them. (The car crashes, now it is On Fire.) With one street and a few cars, that works fine. But add hundreds of cars, each containing a driver with their own priorities, and suddenly things get too much for an individual machine to handle. Typically, online games tackle this by limiting the number of players on each server (for example, Battlefield 1 has a limit of 64 players per game). In games with very large number of players – known as massively multiplayer online, or MMO – developers chop the play space up into different pieces and recreate each piece many times on different servers. (This is called “sharding”, an obscure reference to the early MMO Ultima Online, because: game nerds.) That’s why even though World of Warcraft might have millions of subscribers, you’ll rarely encounter more than a few dozen at any given time. DeepMind: inside Google's super-brain DeepMind: inside Google's super-brain Features 22 Jun 2015 READ NEXT Adam Penenberg: 'We are architects of the simulation we're living in' Adam Penenberg: 'We are architects of the simulation we're living in' By Adam Penenberg SpatialOS introduces an additional computational abstraction, called “Workers”. Simplified, rather than chopping up the simulation by physical space, Workers distribute the simulation by the type of task happening. “You might have the vehicle Worker, which would simulate the vehicles; then you would have maybe a crowd Worker, which simulates how people move around. Then you would have, say, a power Worker working out how power is distributed across the entire city,” explains Peter Lipka, Improbable’s chief operating officer. Crucially, if the computation is too much for one Worker to handle, or a server crashes unexpectedly, SpatialOS will dynamically bring up additional servers and distribute the load across them in real time. Narula describes this as “a giant game of musical chairs”.  “As a whole, what you’ve got now is this set of different Workers all collaborating to simulate a single living, breathing city,” says Lipka. “SpatialOS is the core fabric that binds them together.” It’s an elegant hack, based on a simple underlying notion: that even in such simulations, each part doesn’t need to know about every other part, only the things in proximity to it. Think of a murmuration of starlings, in which each bird is only aware of the small group around it, yet in large enough numbers can produce behaviours of beautiful complexity.

Herman Narula was born in Delhi and grew up wealthy: his father, Harpinder Singh Narula, is a billionaire construction magnate, whose company builds large infrastructure projects across India. Herman received his first computer, an Intel 486, at the age of seven. “I was wandering around the house with a DOS book,” he recalls. The family split his time between India, the US and the UK. “It would be long months with different relatives and family, and little to do, just a computer and some books.” He took naturally to programming and passed his IT GCSE four years early, later landing a place at the University of Cambridge to study computer science. It was on a Thursday in 2012, two months before his finals, that Narula met Whitehead in a dissertation review. Growing up in Liverpool, Whitehead was an avid fan of the virtual world Second Life, where he made money as a virtual arms dealer. “That’s where I developed the entrepreneurial streak,” Whitehead says. In school, he’d build iOS games and put them up on the app store for fun. The pair started to discuss the limitations of online worlds. “He felt the same way I did about the flaw, the big flaw,” Narula says. “Why are online games so cack?” They started talking about what the perfect game would look like: a first-person shooter, with an enormous, endlessly complex virtual world. “Games compromise,” Whitehead says. “We wanted to have so many simulated objects in the world, tens of thousands of people in the same environment.” In short: “We didn’t want to compromise.” READ NEXT Battling insurgency in war-torn nations with immersive 3D sims Battling insurgency in war-torn nations with immersive 3D sims By Liat Clark Improbable chief operating officer Peter Lipka James Day/WIRED The next day, the pair left Cambridge and went to Hyver Hall, the 19th-century Hertfordshire mansion owned by Narula’s family, and started coding. By the end of the year they’d formed a company and were hiring engineers. The team worked out of a barn on the property. One of the earliest hires was Lipka, who joined from Goldman Sachs, where he worked on the bank’s back-end system. A jovial former rugby player with a masters in computer science from Imperial College London, Lipka was intrigued by the daunting technical challenge. “I’ll be honest, they were a little batshit crazy,” he says. “I loved it.” Lipka’s finance background came in handy. “High-frequency trading is basically ‘speed is money,’” Lipka says. “So taking those techniques and applying them to what we were building was incredibly valuable.” Narula’s family had expected him to join the construction business like his brothers, and weren’t happy about his decision to start a tech company. “In some ways, not going into the family business is very much an act of rebellion. It would be silly to argue that it wasn’t as a result of conflict,” says Narula. “I think a lot of it was about demonstrating that there’s a difference between your wealth and their wealth, and there’s a distinction between your achievements and their achievements. But I greatly admire my brothers and my father continues to do such amazing work.” “Very few people, given his background, would have made the life choices that he has made,” Lipka says.

Instead, they set out to create a platform so any developer could build the kind of large-scale simulations they had envisioned. They hired Sam Kalnins, who had developed Hangouts at Google, and Eric Molitor, now Improbable’s VP of engineering, from Amazon. They moved into the London office and funding soon followed: first, from a group of influential British tech investors [Disclaimer: including WIRED editor-at-large David Rowan, who was not involved with this story]. Then, in March 2015, it secured a $20 million investment from Andreessen Horowitz, only its second European investment. “When I first met them, it was a clear that they had something special,” says Vijay Pande, a former Stanford professor who worked on computational biology and distributed simulations prior to joining Andreessen. READ NEXT Ron Howard uses CGI to recreate 1970s Formula 1 in flawless detail for Rush Ron Howard uses CGI to recreate 1970s Formula 1 in flawless detail for Rush By Alex Godfrey “[Herman] is a force of nature,” says Chris Dixon, the managing partner at Andreessen Horowitz who led the investment. “The first time I met him I was like, ‘Woah – what just happened?’ And Rob is brilliant, too.” 'The first time I met Herman I was like, ‘Woah – what just happened?’ With investment secured, Improbable began rapidly expanding. In March 2016, it debuted a working simulation of the internet’s entire underlying infrastructure. The simulation, built with an unnamed department of the UK government, was designed to test what would happen if the web’s routing infrastructure was attacked. At Google’s Cloud Next conference in March 2017, Narula unveiled an even bigger project: a working mock-up of the city of Cambridge, with 130,000 virtual inhabitants. It included simulations of the traffic and public-transport networks, utilities, power lines and mobile-phone and internet systems. Narula claims the Cambridge simulation is “the largest of its kind ever created”. READ NEXT Horse model with inflatable latex intestines helps train vets Horse model with inflatable latex intestines helps train vets By Olivia Solon “They solved a really difficult technical problem,” says Nan Boden, head of global partnerships at Google Cloud. “The first time I saw it, I said, ‘Wow, that’s some really nice computer science work there.’” In May 2017, as WIRED went to press, the company announced it had raised $502million in funding from Softbank, valuing it at over a billion dollars. Improbable CTO and co-founder Rob Whitehead James Day/WIRED We come in peace.” “He’s trying to get away.”  “Prepare to die!” It’s late January, a few weeks before the LA event, and Narula and a few Improbable employees are hanging out in the London offices of Bossa Studios, playing Worlds Adrift. An MMO set in a world of flying pirate ships and floating islands, it is the first game to be built on SpatialOS. As such, the game is also a test bed for the technology. Most weekends, Narula drops by to test the latest build and discuss new features. In the game, Narula, Bossa’s co-founder Henrique Olifiers and I are being hunted. Our play session is being live-streamed on Twitch; Bossa has declared a reward for whomever can find us. In the corner, there is a display with live analytics from SpatialOS. Worlds Adrift is still in Alpha, accessible to only a limited number of testers, but more than 600 players are sharing the same physical space, stretching over 1,000 square kilometres. Worlds Adrift is unlike other MMOs. “We wanted to make a physical world, because in MMOs it has never been done,” says Olifiers. “MMOs are very much turn-based, smoothed out to look like something which is action, but is not. The server is ticking at a couple of times per second.” Chop down a tree in a game like Minecraft, and timber neatly appears in one’s inventory. In Worlds Adrift, the pieces crash realistically to the ground. Load a ship with too much weight, and it’ll start sinking. The world is also persistent, meaning if I drop my axe and come back in a year’s time, it’ll still be there. Likewise, the tree doesn’t just appear for the next player, you actually have to wait for it to grow back. Worlds Adrift, the first game built on SpatialOS Bossa Studios Bossa and Improbable are betting that this permanence will add a layer of immersion unseen in other games. To illustrate the point, Narula tells the story of the Saint Beyoncé. “I don’t see my brother very often. He came over and we spent four days together building this awesome ship,” he recalls. “And I blew it up. I was deeply sad that I destroyed that ship.” “We wanted to make games where everything matters, but apparently that also makes you cry.”   Persistence also adds unforeseen levels of complexity. Worlds Adrift, for example, has its own ecology. Early on in its development, the game featured two kinds of wildlife, flying manta rays and beetles. Except the beetles wouldn’t have sex. “The levels of libido were too low,” Olifiers says “All the females were in heat, but the male beetles were not copulating, so they all died.” (Its developers have since fixed the problem.) MetaWorld, a SpatialOS app being developed by San Francisco-based HelloVR, lets two people play chess in virtual reality together. MetaWorld is also persistent – which seemed like a great idea, until players started throwing virtual chess pieces into the grass, and the Improbable team had to crawl around on their virtual hands and knees to find them. This type of behaviour – complex results emerging from simple systems – is what gets Narula excited. One inspiration for Improbable was the space-set MMO EVE Online, players of which have developed their own political systems and stories; battles often take up thousands of combatants. (EVE Online doesn’t run on Improbable technology, but its own solution, built up over decades.) Because SpatialOS handles most of the back end itself, Improbable says the platform will allow even small indie developers to build games previously reserved for the kind of AAA publishers with huge budgets and server infrastructures. Currently, more than half a dozen developers are building games on SpatialOS – including Klang, a new studio founded by two veterans of EVE Online. If they succeed, Narula expects that number to expand quickly. As part of Improbable’s partnership with Google, developers will be given free use of Google Cloud to test their titles in development. But for Improbable to truly succeed, its biggest test will be outside of gaming. There, too, it’s made impressive strides. In fact, the company has already spawned its first startup. Immense Simulations was spun out of work that Improbable had been collaborating on with the UK government’s Transport Systems Catapult, to simulate fleets of self-driving cars. Using SpatialOS, Immense built a full-scale simulation of Manchester on a match day, using licensed and open-source data to accurately model traffic, population density and other granular details. “Being able to predict demand and where people are going to want to be at different times and how that affects the mobility system – from a business point of view that’s really valuable,” says Immense CEO Robin North. Of course, identifying the technology underpinning any simulation is only half the battle. Whether it’s actually of any use comes down to designing the model of the world. If your simulated tumour or motorway system doesn’t match real-world results, it’s useless. To help solve that problem, Improbable’s plan is for SpatialOS to feature an app-store-like platform for developers to share their models. “Now, if somebody wants to think about how Ebola might spread over a city, and there’s already a simulation of the transport networks that are being used by Transport for London for example, they can say, ‘Well, hey, let’s just plug in our Ebola model of how that might spread on top of that,’” says Narula. It’s that vision – an app store of simulation models – Narula says, that will open the platform up not just to academics, but to any developer in their bedroom who might want to model a tumour spreading in the body. “You’ve not only made it possible to build things that couldn’t be made before, but also you’ve made it ridiculously easy and cheap for a whole bunch of people out there to attack new applications."   Improbable has already discussed potential medical use cases: simulating biological systems. “This could be very interesting to build a model of a cell,” says Pande. “You can imagine jumping to a much larger scale, like an individual human body.” “We want to start building virtual worlds for social science research,” says Ed Castronova, a professor at Indiana University who has studied video game economies. He is planning to use SpatialOS to build behavioural simulations to study, for example, the emergence of violent extremism in populations, or economic models. Researchers at Oxford Martin School are exploring using Improbable to model the UK housing market. Simulations are not only useful for decision-making: as representations of reality, virtual worlds make useful training grounds for AI. DeepMind is using StarCraft; Microsoft is using Minecraft. The think tank OpenAI, part funded by Elon Musk, is building a library of AI environments. “Everyone talks about compute [power],” says Andrej Karpathy, a researcher at OpenAI. “These environments are the second puzzle piece.” Virtual worlds built on SpatialOS could be particularly useful for AI research. “Multi-agent environments are much more interesting, because there are other agents in the environments. You have to learn how to co-operate, how to react. Things become much more complex very quickly.” In Narula’s vision, each of those models could be integrated into the platform: simulations built on simulations, layer by layer. The end goal: a one-to-one virtual representation of the real world that researchers can use to run experiments – what Narula calls reality as a decision-making platform; “a ‘what if’ machine”. Of course, Improbable’s technology is still at an early stage. And while it’s simple to model a motorway network, nobody has come close to accurately modelling human behaviour, with our illogical quirks and tempers. But Castronova is bullish. “We’ve learned a lot about human cognition by looking at rats running around mazes,” he says. “You create the experimental environment and then you make sure you only explore questions that are appropriate to that environment.” A visualisation of a SpatialOS of the internet's underlying infrastructure, built by Improbable with the UK government Improbable In recent years, Silicon Valley has become gripped by the idea that we might be living in a computer simulation. The simulation argument was popularised by a 2003 paper by the Oxford academic and AI doomsayer Nick Bostrom. Simplified, Bostrom argues that given the continued progression of computing power and technologies such as virtual reality, it’s possible that our reality is not the true reality, and instead we live in a simulation created by our own descendants sometime in the distant future. Proponents for this argument include Elon Musk; according to The New Yorker, two Valley billionaires are so convinced that they have employed researchers to explore how we could break out of such a simulation. In LA, at the end of a day of deep, off-the-record discussions about the ethics of creating such virtual worlds, I asked Narula whether he believes that we are indeed living in such a simulation. “Almost definitely, right?” he said – laughing, but only half-joking. “Nick Bostrom’s argument I find quite plausible: the notion that we’re either in one, or it’s impossible to create one. I would argue it’s possible to create a virtual world – I don’t really see why it wouldn’t be. It seems like a very, very challenging engineering problem, but, at the same time, it doesn’t seem like a hard science problem.” Narula was pacing – he rarely sits still – inside a faux New York shop front where we’d retired to talk. “The other thing to think about is if we’re not, maybe we’d like to be,” he said. “Simulations are great. We have mind-body duality with simulation, right? So you can die and it’s OK. There could be an afterlife. So I think one of the interesting things about the simulation argument is, separate from the scientific plausibility of it, it is arguably a return to discussion among atheistic circles about: is there an afterlife? What happens when I die? It’s sort of a cyberpunk version of ‘Is there a God?’” Whether or not we would want to live inside such simulations is debatable, but Narula is aware that Matrix-style worlds are a far-off possibility. Gaming, in particular, has seen startups promise persistent virtual worlds before and failed, hard. “A lot of companies are founded around this problem,” says Hilmar Pétursson, CEO of CCP Games, the creator of EVE Online. “Usually, I have the response of crossing my fingers and saying, ‘I hope it works out.’” Others are more optimistic. “There’s a wide-open space here for doing simulations you couldn’t even conceive of before,” says Boden. Dixon agrees. “This will become a real field. I think we will see other companies in this space.” ADVERTISEMENT “I believe that the underlying technology and the methods they are using are sound,” says Mike Sellers, who teaches game design at Indiana University. Sellers has tasked his students with building worlds on Spatial, and is impressed with the results so far. “I’ve moved past cynical and sceptical into hopeful.” Narula recognises the sheer scale of what he’s suggesting. “The company’s called Improbable,” he grins. “It’s not called ‘extremely certain technology.’” Together, we kicked around the implications of what living in a simulation might entail. In a simulated reality, he suggested, there could be a multiverse; by playing the simulation faster, we could time travel, perhaps see the future. “The other issue is you may not need to replicate the Universe in enormous detail to fool the human mind, so it could be that there’s no one outside there right now,” he says, and gestures to the door. Evening shadows crept along the sidewalk; the ghost town on the Warner Bros lot was indeed suspiciously quiet. “It’s kind of beautiful, in its own strange way.” Subscribe to WIRED Simulations Improbable Gaming Startups Share this article RECOMMENDED Elon Musk: 'It's likely we're living in a simulation and Pong is proof' Elon Musk: 'It's likely we're living in a simulation and Pong is proof' By Matt Burgess Mars 02 Jun 2016 We're all living in a 'conceptual prison': our brains perceive a fraction of reality to keep us alive We're all living in a 'conceptual prison': our brains perceive a fraction of reality to keep us alive By Kathryn Nave Perception 01 Sep 2016 We're just like animals when it comes to finding a date We're just like animals when it comes to finding a date By Gad Saad Mating 30 Mar 2016 What do we need to do before humans can visit Mars?

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Mobile Image Source: YouTube Google Pixel 2 concept suggests Google will double down on a key Pixel feature Chris Smith @chris_writes May 11th, 2017 at 8:46 AM Share Tweet It’s pretty common to see plenty of iPhone concepts flood YouTube at this time of year, as designers try to imagine Apple’s next smartphone. But the iPhone 8 isn’t the only hot handset launching later this year, and some creative minds have already conceived renders for the Galaxy Note 8 and the OnePlus 5 that are kind of interesting. It turns out the Google Pixel 2 is getting plenty of attention from designers as well, and the latest mockup is outstanding. Don't Miss: You can order the Nintendo Switch from GameStop right now for delivery next week YouTube channel Concept Creator, which recently shared an appealing Galaxy Note 8 concept video, is back with a teaser of its vision of the Google Pixel 2. Unlike some of its competitors, the Google Pixel 2 is pretty much a mystery at this point. We know what it’ll be called, and we know its code names. Google also revealed a few months ago that the phone is going to be released this fall, carrying a price tag that is in line with its premium status. That means designers don’t have a lot of rumors to work with. The following concept imagines a Google Pixel 2 handset that’s somewhat similar to its illustrious predecessor, but that takes recent designs from Google’s rivals into account. Google’s new phone features dual cameras both on the back and on the front, at least, in this render. We have no idea what Google will do with the Pixel 2’s cameras this year. But considering the formidable camera performance of the original Pixel series, and the fact that more and more smartphone makers are going for dual lens rear cameras and dual front-facing cameras, we wouldn’t be surprised to see the Pixel 2 follow this trend. The concept also seems to imply the phone will have a full-screen design, which is one other major trend for flagship smartphones this year. Again, we have no way of knowing what Google plans to do with the Pixel 2. The phone is expected to pack an OLED display just like the original Pixel, but that’s pretty much all we know about the phone at this time. Finally, the following clip is just a “teaser,” which means a full video should pop up in the near future.

Google being Google, though, generating your emoji avatar isn’t just a customizable tool, like Nintendo’s Miis or Snapchat’s Bitmoji. Instead, Google’s version implements machine learning and neural networks to map your facial features to animated versions designed by artist Lamar Abrams, which can then be customized further. The finished product is a variety of different stickers featuring your newly minted cartoon doppelgänger to use in future Allo chats. Looking at Google’s research blog reveals some interesting methodology behind the seemingly simple integration, as the company describes the efforts it had to take to avoid the uncanny valley and ensure that people of all races, genders, and ages were represented across the generated illustrations. The new selfie-to-sticker tool should be rolling out today for Allo on Android, with an iOS release coming soon.

Photo: iStock Businesstech stocks Tech companies have become a drag on economic growth The volatility of tech stocks has fallen below the volatility of utility stocks By David P. Goldman May 12, 2017 3:48 AM (UTC+8) Share Tweet Linkedin Print Email Share 0 Comment 0 The stock market’s so-called Fear Index, the VIX gauge of implied volatility on S&P index options, traded this week at its all-time low of around 9.75%. Only on a couple of occasions during the past 30 years has VIX dipped this low, and commentators are puzzled by the apparent expectation of market stasis, despite the uncertainty of a new administration, the vagaries of Fed policy, and the worrying fact that US stocks are priced to perfection. There’s a simple answer to the riddle: It isn’t the same market. Once upon a time the US stock market had disruptive challengers changing the economic landscape — Apple, Google, Cisco, Intel and a half dozen other upstarts. The same companies are there, but they have morphed from the equivalent of Luke Skywalker to Jabba the Hut. Tech companies used to be aggressive growth stocks, the kind that young people bought for long-range gain, while retirees stuck to less-volatile instruments like utility stocks. The DailyBrief Must-reads from across Asia - directly to your inbox The world officially went topsy-turvy this year, when the volatility of tech stocks fell below the volatility of utility stocks. The graph shows the implied volatility of options on the S&P tech sector ETF (ticker XLK) vs. the implied volatility of options on the S&P utilities sector (XLU). Options on volatile stocks cost more than options on stable stocks, because volatility increases the likelihood of a payout. Implied volatility is backed out of the prices of traded options, and reflects investor expectations about future stability. Why would investors expect less volatility from tech stocks than from utilities? Because they are utilities, that is, utilities with neither debt nor regulation. Power, water and sewer companies charge a stable fee to a predictable base of customers. They borrow heavily to build facilities, and are subject to public regulation, such that changes in interest rates and public policy can affect their value. Historically, though, they were widow-and-orphan stocks, the least risky sector of the equity market. In the disruptive days of the 1990s tech boom, the volatility of the S&P technology subsector was two to three times the VIX index. Today the implied volatility of XLK, the tech sector ETF, is actually lower than the VIX. The tech companies have brought down the overall level of market volatility. Tech companies now sit atop a virtual toll booth and impose a charge on a myriad of transactions. Like water and power companies, they have monopolies, although these monopolies are driven by the price of infrastructure and the network effect. Google has the Internet-advertising monopoly. Microsoft has the personal computer software monopoly. Amazon has the Internet sales monopoly. Facebook has the targeted advertising monopoly. And Apple has the oddest monopoly of all: it is the vehicle by which customers assert their individuality by overpaying the largest-capitalization company in the world. Jonathan Taplin observed in the New York Times: “In just 10 years, the world’s five largest companies by market capitalization have all changed, save for one: Microsoft. Exxon Mobil, General Electric, Citigroup and Shell Oil are out and Apple, Alphabet (the parent company of Google), Amazon and Facebook have taken their place. They’re all tech companies, and each dominates its corner of the industry: Google has an 88 percent market share in search advertising, Facebook (and its subsidiaries Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger) owns 77 percent of mobile social traffic and Amazon has a 74 percent share in the e-book market. In classic economic terms, all three are monopolies.” No-one can challenge Google, because the network effect self-reinforcing: the more people rely on it for searches, the more comprehensive it becomes. Websites design their content and coding to maximize Google hits, enhancing its monopoly position. Few websites can survive without Google push ads, which means that Google can tax Internet traffic until the cost of advertising makes it unprofitable. No-one can challenge Amazon. The physical cost of its warehouse infrastructure places a formidable threshold in front of any would-be competitor, and it is a brave business indeed that would forego Amazon’s platform for Internet sales. That allows Amazon to charge a toll on roughly half of all E-commerce in the United States. Business startups used to have a shot at the big time. Now they are sharecroppers on the Amazon-Google-Microsoft-Facebook plantation. The monopolies allow them to make a living, but charge them a toll on every transaction steep enough to keep them small. Product quality has nothing to do with it (as any user of Microsoft Windows will attest). The technology itself fosters a winner-take-all environment, and the winner can squeeze future competitors. As Ryan Cooper wrote recently in The Week: “What makes Google’s search dominance profitable is network effects. Without a large internet to index, and a huge number of people looking for things online, even the best imaginable search would be worthless. The upshot here is that both Google’s overwhelming search dominance and their profitable exploitation thereof are almost wholly unmerited in terms of their actual product. Google is a fine tool, but what defines the company is luck. Its profits come from a largely unearned strategic position within a socially-created communication medium.” Ryan Cooper, Jonathan Taplin and other commentators have suggested some form of regulation or anti-monopoly action to break up the monopolies. Google has long anticipated the day in which the sharecroppers would rise up against the plantation house, and tries to insure itself against such action by cultivating political influence. In 2014, it spent more money lobbying than any other US company. Last year The Guardian described Google’s “revolving door” of senior government advisors hired to lubricate relations with European governments. At Barack Obama’s 2008 Democratic Convention in Denver, the Google party was the premiere event with security that rivaled that of the White House (I crashed it by means that I will not here reveal). Most persuasive is the fact that the tech companies trade like monopolies. They walk like a duck, quack like a duck, and fly like a duck. The collapse of market volatility betrays paralysis, not confidence. A market with no volatility has no upside, either. I do not believe that regulation or anti-monopoly action is much of a solution to the problem, although it might mitigate some of the baneful effects of the tech monopoly. The trouble is that the United States is still coasting on the impact of inventions first made practical in the 1960s and 1970s: mass-produced integrated circuits, inexpensive lasers, light-emitting diodes, and the Internet itself (a latecomer in 1983). The rise of Microsoft, Google, Apple and Facebook could not have been anticipated 40 years ago, even after the building-blocks were already on the market. We have yet to invent the next generation of technologies that will displace the existing monopolies. And until we make concerted effort to do so, the American economy will languish in the sort of stasis that the options markets reflect.

Fake ruse: USA Today calls the FBI after half of its 15m Facebook Likes turn out to be bogus 32 Emergent Tech Try not to scream: Ads are coming to Amazon's Alexa – and VR goggles Well, of course they are 11 May 2017 at 20:07, Kieren McCarthy It's time to let Benjamin Franklin know that there is a third inevitability in life. To death and taxes, we must add advertisements. Despite a backlash against Google in March for adding a movie ad to its Google Home voice-assistant [surely you mean "invite to our partner to be our guest and share its tale"? – ed.], and another against Burger King for a similar stunt, advertisers are desperate to squeeze themselves into Amazon's voice-operated, Alexa-powered Echo. And they may have found a way thanks to VoiceLabs, which will soon add "sponsored messages" as a service to its analytics tools for "skills" apps that use Alexa-powered Echoes. In other words, apps can start pushing audio ads through Amazon's Echoes. VoiceLabs claims the messages will be the first "voice-first" advertising that people will love, and it apparently already has some big brands on board. Out of more than a million tests of its technology, it has only had a handful of complaints, it is claimed. How is this possible when Amazon specifically bans ad on Alexa? Well, here's the thing: it doesn't ban them entirely. In fact, if you offer "flash briefing skills where ads are not the core functionality of the skill" – effectively news – then you are allowed to offer ads. Likewise if you are streaming music or radio. The reason is obvious – Amazon (and Google) don't want to close the door to audio services like traditional radio over their device, and ads are the most critical form of income for those services. But it does open the door to Alexa-only ads. Nothing escapes the eyes of the ad men – as was made plain by a digital marketing conference earlier this week in which a marketing analyst said devices like the Amazon Echo and Google Home would account for 25 per cent of digital ads within the next three years. Change Ignoring the fact that Amazon seems determined to take its unexpected Echo success and ruin it as much as possible by adding cameras and touchscreens to different versions of it, will the switch from the currently ad-free world of Echo and Home to just another ad-infested medium be sufficient for consumers to turn away from the devices, or will we all just get used to it? And we can also ask the same question of virtual reality headsets. Yes, marketing companies have them in their sights too. Only this time, rather than adopt a radio-ad approach, companies are looking to do product placement. So if you are playing your new VR game on your Oculus later this year, don't be surprised to see a pair of Nike sneakers appearing in shop fronts, or a Coke can popping up on that table next to you. In this case it is VR advertising platform maker Vertebrae behind the efforts to monetize your eyeballs. The company has $10m in VC money and is planning to launch version 1.0 of its software development kit very soon. VRFocus had a chat with Vertebrae's CEO and, as ad companies always are, he was full of energy and happiness about the opportunity to shove companies' products down millions of users' throats while talking about how much he respects those self-same users. Vertebrae's unique take: it will add 3D objects, rather than 2D slogans, into VR content. "We are building units and formats that are true to the medium of VR, and presented in the right way as someone is navigating in a VR experience," he claims. Just as marketing execs are all over voice assistant, so they are holding meetings about the "new opportunities" that VR and augmented reality (AR) provide corporations. "By using VR and AR, publishers and their advertisers can build native, shareable user experiences that will ultimately make ads much less intrusive," says CEO of Appetizer Mobile, Jordan Edelson.

Now, many in the Mozilla and Chromium browser development communities are calling for Symantec to either take drastic action to improve or risk losing its privileges as a trusted certification authority -- even as Symantec has continued to push back against all charges. Find out how the Symantec certificate authority operation is now facing the possibility of being dropped from the trusted certificate authority (CA) programs of the two major browsers unless it can convince the browser community that it can address all the issues. Date Event 9/18/2015 Google uses Certificate Transparency logs to catch Symantec certificate authority staff improperly issuing Extended Validation Certificates for domains it does not own -- including Google domains. The certificates are issued for testing purposes, and neither Symantec nor Google believe any users are at risk due to the issuances. Symantec announces that it has fired the employees deemed responsible in a blog post titled "A Tough Day as Leaders," though the post appears to have been removed from Symantec's site since. 10/28/2015 After a month of deliberation, Google imposes sanctions on Symantec CA for the improper certificate issuance discovered through Certificate Transparency. Google announces that Symantec certificate authorities must submit to an extended third-party audit schedule, as well as requiring that Symantec comply with Certificate Transparency for all the certificates it issues -- not just Extended Validation Certificates, starting Jun. 1, 2016. 6/1/2016 Symantec is required to comply with Certificate Transparency for all certificates it issues. 1/19/2017 Security researcher Andrew Ayer uses Certificate Transparency logs and reports finding 108 bad certificates issued by Symantec certificate authorities between July 2016 and January 2017. Symantec responds by revoking all of the certificates that had not previously been revoked, and reduces certificate issuing privileges for its partners responsible for the improperly issued certificates. 1/26/2017 As the number of bad certificates identified rises to 127, Symantec responds to Google's questions about the misissued certificates. Symantec states it is reviewing its registration authority (RA) program and taking other steps to review issues raised with its partners and auditors. The company later discontinued its RA program. 3/23/2017 The Google Chromium browser development team reports that its investigation revealed as many as 30,000 certificates that were improperly issued or validated by Symantec certificate authorities over the past several years, and proposes actions in response to Symantec's failures. Google's proposal would deprecate and remove trust in existing Symantec-issued certificates by reducing the validity period for new Symantec certificates to nine months, requiring all Symantec-issued certificates to be revalidated and replaced, and removing the Extended Validation status from Symantec-issued certificates for at least one year. 3/24/2017 Symantec announces the termination of its beleaguered registration authority program, the source of a number of the issues raised by Google and Mozilla. 3/26/2017 In an announcement objecting to Google's proposed plan for deprecating trust in its certificates, Roxane Divol, executive vice president and general manager of Symantec Website Security, writes the company is "proud to be one of the world's leading certificate authorities" and that "we operate our CA in accordance with industry standards." Divol also writes that "We do not believe Google's proposal is in the best interest of the Internet community." 3/31/2017 Following Google's actions, Mozilla developer Gervase Markham posts a complete list of the Symantec certificate authority issues raised on the Chromium developers forum, and requests further clarification from Symantec. The Mozilla team lists 14 issues related to Symantec certificate authorities, some dating as far back as 2009, including the issuance of SHA-1 certificates after the deadline for using the deprecated algorithm, the issuance of certificates for domains without permission from the domain owners and ongoing issues raised in audits that were not addressed by Symantec. 4/10/2017 Even more questions are raised after Symantec posts its response to issues raised on the Mozilla developers forum. Mozilla's Markham sets a deadline of Thursday, Apr. 20, 2017, for Symantec to respond to the further questions raised on the forum. 4/20/2017 Just before the deadline imposed by Mozilla, Symantec issues its official response to the certificate authority issues listed in the Mozilla developers forum, and requests the opportunity to offer an alternative plan for reinstating trust in its certificates. Noting that WoSign, the troubled Chinese certificate authority dropped from Mozilla's trusted certificate issuers list in 2016, was given an opportunity to propose an alternate plan for it to continue operations, Markham sets another deadline for Symantec to propose its own alternative plan. 4/26/2017 Symantec offers a much less onerous proposal to restore trust in its certificate authorities. Claiming its counter-proposal "addresses the concerns raised by Google about our CA business without imposing undue business disruption on our customers and Chrome users that we believe would result if Google implements its proposal," Symantec proposes additional and more frequently conducted audits, and promises that it will address operational issues. 4/27/2017 Ryan Sleevi, software engineer and tech lead for Chrome's networking security team at Google, reports Symantec was offered a second option that would have allowed it to remain a trusted certificate authority: effectively turning over Symantec certificate authority operations to one or more existing CAs, and starting over from scratch to rebuild its public key infrastructure (PKI). 5/1/2017 Mozilla responds to Symantec's counter-proposal by suggesting that Google's second option -- outsourcing its certificate authority operations to one or more outside CAs -- is its preferred course of action at this time. Markham notes that, while audits, which form the bulk of Symantec's counter-proposal, are important, they are not "a guarantor of appropriate conduct" on the part of a certificate authority. "Symantec should seriously consider Google's proposal for simplifying and restoring trust in their public PKI," Markham writes. 5/4/2017 Symantec reiterates its confidence in being able to remediate certificate authority issues through increased audits and process improvements, as well as promising to deliver third-party audits by Aug. 31, 2017, that confirm its "issuance processes are sound." Writing in a blog post titled "Symantec CA Continues the Public Dialogue," Symantec rejects the calls from Mozilla and Google to outsource its operations to a third party. 5/7/2017 In a post to the Mozilla developers forum, Rick Andrews, senior technical director for website security at Symantec, announces that Symantec has "established a new dialogue" between senior executives at Google and Symantec to "arrive at a new proposal" that will have less effect on Symantec's customers. A Google spokesperson confirms that Chrome is involved in that dialogue, but the search giant makes no further comment. 5/9/2017 Mozilla withdraws its alternative proposal for remediating trust in Symantec certificate authorities; Markham writes that, given the low degree of engagement on Symantec's part, and the need to move forward to restore compliance, the only option for Symantec to remain a trusted CA for Mozilla is to turn over its CA operations to a trusted third-party. Symantec does not respond to requests for comment on this development. 5/10/2017 In a posting on the Chrome developers forum, Tarquin Wilton-Jones, a member of the security team for Opera Software, states that the Opera browser will likely follow whatever action Chromium takes regarding trust in Symantec certificates, but he adds that the Opera team "would still encourage Google's second proposal [outsourcing CA processes to another CA] to be used as the preferred solution."

In the following tutorial, I will talk about a free and handy method that will let you send tweets from Google Sheets at scheduled time. And you can send as many tweets as you want and include images and hyperlinks in them as well. The tweet scheduler that I will talk about only requires the twitter API credentials for the account for which you will schedule the tweets. If you are indulged in digital marketing, then surely at some point you need automation tools. And when it comes to Twitter, then what could be better than a free tool that will auto post your tweets at the specified time. And in the following tutorial, I will explain how to schedule tweets with Google Sheets. Sponsored Links There are already some services to schedule tweets. But, those services puts a limitation that you can only post limited number of tweets. And that’s why I have come up with this tutorial. Using this method, you will be able to schedule a lot of tweets (2400/day) with links and images. How to Schedule Tweets Using Google Sheets? There is a pre-ready Google Sheet available that you can use to send tweet automatically to your Twitter timeline. All you have to do is just follow the below steps to make it work. Step 1: Make a copy of this Google Sheet to your account. Then, open it and you will see three tabs at the bottom of this sheet. The tabs are Twitter, About, and Settings. Step 2: Open the Twitter API webpage from here. After that, register an application there using your Twitter credentials. Next, you will be redirected to the page where you will have to enter some credentials like app name, website, description, call back URL (optional), etc. After specifying these, click on the Create your Twitter application button. Step 3: Next, you will be directed to your Twitter application page. Now, navigate to the “Keys and Access tokens” section and copy down the Consumer key and Consumer secret to somewhere. Next, copy Access token and Access token Secret. If they are not already there, click the generate Access token button and copy them down too. Step 4: Now, come back to the Google Sheet and move to its “Settings” tab. After that, fill the Consumer key, Consumer Secret, Access Token, and Access Token with the values that you have noted in step 3. Leave the Project key cell as it is. After typing the values “Scheduler” tab will appear in your sheet. Step 5: Authorize your sheet to send tweets by clicking on “Authorize Script” option. This option is available in “Scheduler” tab of the spread sheet. After the successful authorization, the sheet will be able to schedule tweets. Step 6: Now, test the working of the sheet, by clicking on the Scheduler > Send a Test Tweet option. If the tweet is posted to your Twitter account, then it means the Sheet is working, you can now start using it to schedule tweets. Step 7: To enter your tweets, move to the twitter tab of the Google Sheet. After that, you will see various fields there that you have to fill out and they are: Content: Here you will type your tweet. Do note that, the tweet should be less than or equal to 140 characters. URL: If you want to add a URL in your tweet, then you have to add the URL in this field. And the token “{{Url}}” token in the tweet text. One thing to remember is that, if you specify a link in URL field but don’t use it in the tweet text with the token, then an error will occur. And the same will happen if you do the opposite. Length: It will tell you the length of the tweet that you have typed. Google Media ID: This Google Sheet lets you add media that it will post along with the tweet. The media can be image, GIF, or a video available in your Google Drive. The media ID is a long string of text that is visible in URL of media on Google Drive. It could be something like this: “0BwmeHir3110wZmZqcUNXd3FHYVk”. Publish Date: Here you will specify the date and time at which it will send the tweet. Status: Here you will see the status of the tweet, whether it is posted or not. Step 8: So, finally fill all the details and specify the time and start scheduler using the Start Scheduler option from the Scheduler tab of the sheet. That is how you can easily schedule tweets using Google Sheets. You may find the process a bit lengthy, but it is a one time effort. And after that, all you have to do is just type you tweets and start the scheduler. It will then post your tweets on your Twitter time line. Final Verdict: Google Sheets makes it very easy to schedule tweets. This option is especially useful if you want to send same tweet multiple times. Just copy that tweet multiple times, and change schedule time for each of them.

Skip to content Naked Security Computer Security News, Advice and Research sophos.com Free Tools Go Award-winning computer security news Twitter Facebook Google+ LinkedIn Feed Google won’t fix Android ‘contentjacking’ flaw for months 11 May 2017 3 Malware, Vulnerability Post navigation Previous: News in brief: laptop ban could be extended; DDoS hits news sites; Taiwan might block Google DNS by Paul Ducklin 0Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Google+ Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit There’s recently been a lot of media coverage about a so-called Android vulnerability related to a feature called SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW. Simply put, this is a special Android permission that grants an app the right to pop up content over another app, like a telephone app does if a call comes in while you’re browsing. Obviously, this sort of power is ripe for abuse – a crook could make the popped-over window look exactly like what’s underneath, for example, and therefore phish you into putting your password into the wrong form, or trick you into clicking a button to approve the wrong action. For this reason, according to security researchers at Check Point, Google made the SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW permission into one that couldn’t be used surreptitiously, starting in Android 6. The first time an app tried to assert its right to write over the top of another app, you’d get a security warning that required explicit approval. (That’s not a panacea, of course – generic-sounding security dialogs often get clicked away regardless – but it at least gave you a fighting chance of detecting risky app behaviour.) Sophos Home Destroy malware in your sleep Learn More It seems, however, that many popular apps, such as Facebook and Pocket, used the SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW feature. Users were therefore getting security warnings for apps that they otherwise considered to be perfectly safe. As a result, Google backed off a bit from its security stance: in the Android 6.0.1 release, the alert window that popped up to warn you that a SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW was about to pop up… …was suppressed if the app had come from Google Play. You might think, if Google felt strongly enough to consider SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW a potential malware-related security problem in the first place, that it would take extra care over approving Play Store apps that made use of it. According to Check Point, however, many apps that abuse SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW to create malicious visual overlays have been found in Google Play – sufficiently many, in fact, that the media has dubbed this an actively exploited vulnerability. Google doesn’t seem to agree, as it says that a “fix” will be out only in the next release of Android, version O, which is likely to appear more than 90 days from now. (90 days is the longest that Google’s Project Zero thinks it should take to patch a security hole.) Vulnerability or not? We’re inclined to concur that the SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW permissions issue isn’t really a vulnerability – it’s more of a security improvement that ended up shelved, which is not the same thing as what we usually mean when we talk about security vulnerabilities. SECURITY GLOSSARY: Vulnerabilities and exploits explained ► The risk here is at a much broader and more dangerous level, namely that apps containing obvious coding abuses – of any sort, not just abuses related to pop-over windows – are getting through the doorway into Google’s walled garden in the first place. Google Play is a bit like a happening nightclub: the more people you attract, the more you attract people, so you want to make it popular and easy to get in. But the faster you let people in, the less time you have to spend on keeping the troublemakers out up front. In other words, sticking to Google Play isn’t a bad idea, but it can definitely give you a false sense of security. Businesses are therefore in a bit of a Catch 22 over this: if you block Google Play, you may end up turning on Android’s “Allow installation apps from unknown sources” instead. But “unknown sources” opens you up to a massive menagerie of mobile markets, in many of which almost anything goes, especially malware. What to do? For corporate management of mobile devices, it’s worth considering some sort of centralised mobile control software. This can help your IT team to prevent egregious mistakes – for example, by unobtrusively blocking apps that no one has heard of yet and that therefore represent an as-yet unknown risk – while still allowing fun and freedom among better-trusted parts of the ecosystem. That way, you can keep things locked down to Google Play, which is a good start, but also impose your own additional rules to keep you safe when Google doesn’t. For your own Android device at home, why not try our Mobile Security for Android tool – it’s a free download. (Er, yes, you get it from the Play Store.)

But Google themselves can sit around and twiddle their thumbs? Maybe MS or Apple should divulge the details of the vulnerabilities to that hackers can fully reap the benefit of the information? You know, like Google does to MS and Apple? Or rather, to be specific, like Google does to MS and Apple customers? Reply Laurence Marks says: May 11, 2017 at 7:34 pm Well, that’s silly! Why doesn’t Google modify Android so “Open A System_Alert_Window” is a “permission” just like “Access Contacts” or “Send SMS.” Then at the time of install, the user would have a chance to decide whether to grant the permission. Then force an update of all apps using System_Alert_Window so users can see and decide on the added permission. It would be even better if Android had granular permissions, e.g., Allow SMS but forbid System_Alert_Window, instead of an all-or-none approach. (I just deleted an NOAA Hurricane Tracker app which was relaying government data but popping up fake AV warning all the time. I couldn’t see a way to report it to Google–all I could do was give it a bad review. Reply Laurence Marks says: May 11, 2017 at 7:35 pm What’s the plan for those of us stuck on Android 5.

The first market is confirmed to be Philadelphia. Google is in the process of reaching out to local companies to begin the vetting process. The expansion to Philadelphia came to light as a client of 1SEO.com Digital Agency (disclosure: the agency I work for) was contacted by a Google representative inquiring about an opportunity to become a potential Home Service Ads customer. To get started in Philadelphia, Google is only onboarding plumbing professionals. Currently in the stage of reaching out to businesses, around 30-40 plumbing companies will be contacted as Google is looking to launch their partners and Home Service Ads by mid-June. All partners that have passed a rigorous background check and vetting process will be included in a local ad carousel where a Google guaranteed tag is placed on the listing. The tag lets customers know the job will be done correctly or their money back as part of Google’s guarantee. When onboarding a company and before the vetting process is able to begin, Google requires: Business name Business phone number Business address Google registered email address Website Contractor’s license number Service area (cities or radius) Hours of operation Year founded Amount of general liability insurance coverage Customers that are searching on Google for plumbing companies can see reviews and get in direct contact with businesses straight from search results. Users can send a request for service or directly call the business. Since August 2015, users in certain California markets conducting local searches for plumbers, electricians, locksmiths, handymen, and other home service providers have seen a carousel format of ads. Read more about the Home Service feature from Google. Now, users in the Philadelphia market will see local plumbing professionals become Google partners in mid to late June.

Adam Rogers Science Date of Publication: 05.11.17. 05.11.17 Time of Publication: 3:16 pm. 3:16 pm Star Neuroscientist Tom Insel Leaves the Google-Spawned Verily for … a Startup? Larry French/Getty Images Add another high-profile departure to the list of people leaving Verily, the Google-spawned health science company: Thomas Insel, a neuroscientist and former head of the National Institutes of Mental Health who was leading Verily’s mental health initiatives. After barely a year and a half, Insel is joining a startup called Mindstrong, aiming to come up with technologies to diagnose and treat mental disorders. (The semantic web of Google companies: Verily, which used to be called Google Life Sciences, is partially owned by Alphabet, which used to be called Google and now owns Google.) At first look, Insel’s new gig sounds a lot like his old gig. So what could be going on at Verily—or with Insel—that would lead him to bail on Google-sized money, freedom, ambition, and datasets? “I’ve been asking myself that question a lot in the last few weeks. It was a tough decision,” Insel says. “Google has phenomenal resources, and Verily is a really exciting place to work. I just developed this kind of entrepreneurial itch. That’s what drove me to leave government, and even within Alphabet and Verily I felt like I had to scratch it at some point.” Insel’s hopes for research have always been outsized. You might remember the hypothesis—somewhat controversial—that the hormone oxytocin is a key to human attraction and relationship-formation. That was his work. Insel brought to NIMH a commitment to finding neurochemical and other quantifiable markers for psychiatric disorders rather than relying on behavior and self-reported feelings. He even wanted to throw out the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, the bible of psychiatric symptomatology. For the past few years, well before moving to Verily in 2015, Insel was writing about using biomarkers and mobile technologies to create “precision medicine for psychiatry.” Apparently it didn’t work. “I spent 13 years at NIMH really pushing on the neuroscience and genetics of mental disorders, and when I look back on that I realize that while I think I succeeded at getting lots of really cool papers published by cool scientists at fairly large costs—I think $20 billion—I don’t think we moved the needle in reducing suicide, reducing hospitalizations, improving recovery for the tens of millions of people who have mental illness,” Insel says. “I hold myself accountable for that.” If biomarkers can’t diagnose mental health issues, maybe a “digital phenotype” can. In 2015, Insel told Technology Review that this was why he was jumping to Alphabet: the idea that a combination of your medical records (electronically stored, duh) and how you use your gadgets—tracking of activity correlating with depression or future self-harm, let’s say—could be a Big Data bonanza for predicting and treating health issues. “For a bipolar patient whose mania is manifested in rapid, uninterruptible speech or hypergraphia, their disease could be characterized by the frequency, length, and content of participation in social media,” write the researchers who defined the term in Nature Biotechnology. In fact, mood is one of the things that Verily’s $100 million Baseline study will track among its 10,000 eventual participants. At Mindstrong, one of the first tests of the concept will be a study of how 600 people use their mobile phones, attempting to correlate keyboard use patterns with outcomes like depression, psychosis, or mania. “The complication is developing the behavioral features that are actionable and informative,” Insel says. “Looking at speed, looking at latency or keystrokes, looking at error—all of those kinds of things could prove to be interesting.” Maybe in five years digital phenotypes will have gone the way of neurobiology and genetics in mental health, Insel acknowledges, but for now the tech ideas are worth a look. You can understand how investors might be drawn to a startup working on the problem, especially one that boasts not only the former head of the NIMH but also Richard Klausner, the former head of the National Cancer Institute. “At some level, people with psychiatric things going on in the background are much more likely to have other health care problems in the background, too,” says Jim Tananbaum, whose Foresite Capital is a major investor in Mindstrong. “I’m sorry to be oblique, but if you were to look at avoidable hospitalizations, depression tracks with those.” In other words: Mindstrong offers the potential for money-saving predictive mechanisms. And you can understand why the health care world would be open to that kind of technology, too. “Those kind of applications are the ones I like most, because they’re one-to-many,” says Joseph Kvedar, who runs the Connected Health program at Partners Health Care in Boston. “They enable us to look at a population, screen in the background for challenges, and then intervene when necessary with a qualified professional to help. What we do now is wait for you to decide you’re depressed and come to us.” But it would have been a worthy problem at Verily, too. The company has seen a series of departures, some back to the Google mothership and some out of the Googleplex altogether. An article in Stat blamed Verily’s CEO, Andrew Conrad, saying he’s mercurial in setting priorities. The Baseline study has launched, but other Verily projects, like a Tricorder-like medical scanner and a glucose-sensing contact lens, haven’t worked out yet. Neither has the company announced any specific mental health-oriented initiatives. “I have a tremendous fondness for the company and for the CEO, and feel strongly that he’s gotten a pretty raw deal in the press coverage,” Insel says. “It was really difficult for me to leave because of my attachment to Andy Conrad, who I think has been a really visionary leader there … If anything, Andy’s frustration was that we couldn’t move faster and go farther, especially on the mental health team.” As to whether Mindstrong will move fast or far enough for Insel, he’ll have the first hint in six months or so—when the data from that 600-person study starts coming in.

Recently, Google’s SERP has gone through yet another evolution, with the addition of a rich featured snippet known as Google’s Answer Box. Since its initial launch, the Answer Box Snippet has continued to gain traction, but it wasn’t until 2016 that brands really started utilizing it. To get a better understanding of how companies use it, our team at iQuanti ran an internal analysis across multiple enterprise SEO organic footprints in multiple industries, and found 4-6 times the growth of keyword terms now triggering an Answer Box result. As we all know, Google tries to interpret search intent based on selected keywords and associated behavior models. Within this model, Google attempts to surface a relevant result and display it within the SERP as a highlighted boxed result – known as an Answer Box. Google is known to test features, innovations and algorithmic updates often, leading us to question whether or not these tests will become a permanent fixture on Google. So is the Google Answer Box here to stay? Right now, all indications say yes – not least the patent that Google has filed around the Answer Box intellectual property. This means that it could be well worth your time devising a strategy to maximize your chances of achieving a Google Answer Box. Why is achieving a Google Answer Box important? To answer this question, we might well ask in return: Why is any organic rank position important? Rank positions attract search users’ clicks – also known as “click-throughs” – which are measured in CTR, or Click-Through Rate. A higher rank improves CTR, which increases traffic to your website. The absolute position of the answer box sits above all other rank positions and is now coined as “Rank zero”.  So what is better than being ranked first in Google search? Being in rank zero. However, if that is not convincing enough, let’s dive into our data analysis. On average, the Google Answer Box secures an astounding 32.3 percent CTR. This means that for the given term(s) triggered within your organic footprint, you are either securing approximately 32 percent market share of that volume, or losing it – which makes for a significant opportunity. Is rank 1 still rank 1 with Google Answer Box present? Short answer: No. Based on several data analysis across several keyword sets and vertical markets, our team concluded that without an answer box present, organic rank 1 position yields on average about a 25 percent CTR (branded and non-branded have different standard CTR curves). However, what happens when an Answer Box is present on that same exact keyword? Our data shows on average that when an answer box is present, the average CTR for that same keyword in the same number 1 rank position drops to about an 18 percent CTR. Looking at the chart below, we can see that without any loss of rank position (maintaining rank 1), the CTR for the six keyword examples declines rapidly when an Answer Box result surfaces into the equation is but not achieved. Then, once the answer box is achieved, the CTR climbs back up, surpassing the organic rank 1 position to the upper echelon of 30-35 percent. This behavior is represented both in branded and non-branded keyword sets within the SERP. This confirms that just as important as ranking top organically is to your enterprise SEO campaigns, you cannot overlook the integration of a strong strategy to acquire the answer box triggers. 5 easy steps to develop a Google Answer Box strategy Of course it does not take much convincing on the importance of this rich featured snippet within Google’s landscape, but how does a brand start developing a sound strategy that can acquire these results? Instead of just publishing another article about how powerful the Answer Box is, we came up with a simple 5-step strategy that will give brands a better understanding of how to implement a Google Answer Box strategy. Step 1. The footprint triggers The first part of this plan is to know and understand which keywords are triggering an Answer Box. Start by pulling the organic footprint of your brand’s domain, which is every organic keyword you are ranking for, regardless of rank position. Then use a tool (like SEMrush or ALPS) to tell you which keywords are triggering a featured snippet. If you are really curious, you can map these data points across the last year and see how your own organic footprint has grown within the Answer Box landscape. It may just unlock some answers for why you have experienced traffic loss without an apparent cause. After segmenting out the data for your own footprint, I would recommend doing it for you competitors as well. Everything is public knowledge so no need for guilt or be surprised when they do it to you. By overlaying their data across yours, you can gain a deeper understanding of your competitive landscape. From there, you can also run a gap analysis to see which keywords within the competitive footprint are triggering the Answer Box that you do not have within yours. We will save this data for quadrant 4 of the prioritization matrix.

Step 2. 2×2 prioritization matrix The second step is to prioritize and categorize all of this data. In order to do this, I recommend a simple 2×2 matrix. In order to be considered for Google’s Answer Box, you need the proper authority and relevance. So for the first quadrant, take a look at all the keywords that currently rank in a top 5 organic rank position (authority needed to win a result). This means the web page in market for those keywords already have adequate authority signals. The second quadrant would be the keywords filtered by highest volume and mixed authority (largest impact to traffic based on volume). What this means is that if you acquire an answer box result for high volume keyword terms, they will drive the most traffic to your website. However with mixed authority signals, you may need to work on building authority to those pages and key terms. The third quadrant would be the keyword terms that have authority signals from rank 5+, or first page keyword terms and mixed volume. This means you will need to try to boost the rank and relevancy to get a payout. Lastly, the final quadrant is those keyword triggers from your competitive landscape that we referenced above (new pages, new volume). These are keywords that you do not have any content or an existing rank for, which equates to new opportunity and new volume. Step 3. A game of jeopardy Now the fun begins. Having all of these keywords that trigger an answer box is one thing, but more importantly is knowing how and why they create that trigger for Google. As I mentioned in the beginning of this article, Google is trying to interpret intent and understand what you are really looking for. So if the answer box is providing an answer, you just need to figure out what the question is. Welcome to Jeopardy! This is subjective, however, as you also need to try and understand what question(s) Google is trying to answer, and then make sure your website is answering them. This truly is about the user experience. Step 4. Answer elements – expanding your on-page content According to Google’s patent that has been filed on Answer Box results, the algorithm is calculating “answer elements” and providing an accumulative score. To translate this into simple terms, this means that if website A answers the mystery question with a paragraph of text and a direct answer, it receives a score. If website B answers that same question, also with paragraph text in a direct fashion, however also answers it with expanded elements (tables, charts, graphs, etc.) then website B has answered the question with more answer elements, thus achieving a higher answer element score. In addition, if website B expands and answers “halo” questions (surrounding or supplementing questions), then it is not only providing more answer elements but a stronger user experience. If it is good for the user it is good for Google. To help illustrate this, here are a few of the many forms Google has introduced into the answer box where you can see different types of answer elements displayed. Text Version Bullet Version Image Version Table Version Step 5. Understanding the role of authority: Do I have to be ranked 1? How does authority or rank play a role? Can only rank 1 achieve an Answer Box? No. I have seen up to rank 5 position still acquire the Answer Box within Google’s SERP. As with all SEO, there is a contribution of both authority signals and relevancy that make up the winning answer. So yes, you will need to have enough topical authority to render your relevant content authoritative, but it does not look like you MUST be ranked in first position to secure the Answer Box result.

The answer lies in 1960s hippie culture and LSD-taking creatives By Oliver Wainwright / The Guardian May 11, 2017 Print Comments Wooden wonder … the Apple 1 computer. Ed Uthman/Ed Uthman/Flickr Photo Credit: Ed Uthman/Ed Uthman/Flickr Next time you drag a document across your desktop and put it in a folder, spare a thought for acid. Organising your files might not seem like a psychedelic experience now, but in 1968, when Douglas Engelbart first demonstrated a futuristic world of windows, hypertext links and video conferencing to a rapt audience in San Francisco, they must have thought they were tripping. Especially because he was summoning this dark magic onto a big screen using a strange rounded controller on the end of a wire, which he called his “mouse”. Like many California tech visionaries of the time, Engelbart was an enthusiastic advocate for the mind-expanding benefits of LSD. As head of the Augmented Human Intellect Research Center at the Stanford Research Institute, he and his team would drop acid under test conditions in the hope of inspiring new breakthroughs. His own technological epiphanies while tripping seem to have been limited: in one session, after staring at a blank wall in fascination for hours, he came up with the “tinkle toy”, a potty-training aid in the form of a miniature water wheel that would spin and tinkle when peed on. But he remained convinced that the drug opened doors to alternative realities, including one where people could control computers through screens. This way to the future … a page from Susan Kare’s sketchbook. Photograph: kareprints.com/Design Museum In a grainy black and white film of his 1968 conference demonstration – since known in the tech hall of fame as “The Mother of All Demos” – Engelbart calmly introduces the embryonic forms of what would become word processing, email, Skype and Google Docs, all shown on a screen with scalable windows controlled by a mouse. For computer scientist Alan Kay, who would go on to develop these ideas at the Xerox PARC research institute, it changed everything. “The demo was one of the greatest experiences of my life,” he later said. “To me, it was Moses opening the Red Sea. It reset the whole conception of what was reasonable to think about in personal computing.” Engelbart’s video will be on display in the London Design Museum’s forthcoming exhibition, California: Designing Freedom, a show that aims to shine a kaleidoscopic spotlight on the cross fertilisation of counterculture and tech culture on America’s “left coast” over the last 50 years. “Think of ‘California design’ and you tend to think of Charles and Ray Eames and the world of mid-century modernism,” says curator Justin McGuirk. “We wanted to focus on what came next, and show how the hippie movement combined with the hacker culture to develop tools of personal liberation.” From skateboards and LSD blotting paper tabs to iPhones and Google’s self-driving car, the exhibition will unpick the west coast ethos that has fostered the development of devices for escapism and self-sufficiency. It shows how, as frontier territory on the edge of a continent, California has always incubated a culture of self-reliance and reinvention, as a place that attracts people fond of fantasy, freedom and rebellion – and how they have mobilised design to meet these ends. The development of user interface design is one of the most fascinating threads in the story, and one of the least obvious, because it has become second nature to us all. “These things now seem so intuitive,” says co-curator Brendan McGetrick, “that a computer document looks like a white piece of paper with text on it, that it sits on an office-like ‘desktop’, that you delete things by dragging them into a trash can. It didn’t have to be this way – these are the results of specific design decisions.” Friendly face … Susan Kare’s Mac welcome icon greeted users booting up. Photograph: kareprints.com/Design Museum The now-ubiquitous desktop metaphor first emerged from Kay’s Xerox PARC work in the form of the Alto computer in 1973, and later the Star in 1981, the first device to use windows, icons and drop-down menus. It is shown in the exhibition as an early mock-up with pieces of paper pasted on to a slate. On a tour of the Xerox facility in 1979, a 24-year-old Steve Jobs was captivated. “I thought it was the best thing I’d ever seen in my life,” he said. “Within 10 minutes, it was obvious to me that all computers would work like this someday.” It turned out that Jobs, Steve Wozniak and his hippie chums from the Homebrew Computer Club, who together founded Apple in 1976, had a better knack for communicating the potential of this new technology than the corporate folks at Xerox. A quick comparison of their TV adverts tells you everything you need to know about the importance of design and marketing to the commercial fate of the two companies. While the 1981 ad for the Xerox Star is set in a workaday office, and methodically explains how the computer will revolutionise secretarial work and filing, Apple’s 1984 commercial for the first Macintosh was a thrilling teaser directed by Ridley Scott, showing a room of grey human automatons being lectured by a Big Brother figure on a big screen – which is then dramatically shattered by dashing female athlete hurtling a big hammer. Apple, it seemed to say, would provide salvation. The Mac would be the disruptive tool to achieving ultimate personal freedom. Alternative realities … LSD tabs with a California design. Photograph: Design Museum In the grid-ruled notebooks of graphic designer Susan Kare, also on show, it is possible to see how Apple understood the importance of humour and familiarity in translating something that had always been the preserve of big corporations and the military into something people would welcome into their homes – and be able to understand. Kare famously developed the smiling Mac icon, displayed as the computer booted up, along with the lasso, paint-bucket and trash can, transforming the cold and intimidating early desktop computers into something friendly. The Apple 1’s handmade wooden case, also on show, was a direct link to the hippie, maker culture of the communes. It is a theme that continued in the “skeuomorphic” design of Apple icons and software, with digital tools aping their real-world counterparts, be it calculator buttons or the yellow squares of sticky Post-it notes. In a world where our smartphones are often the first things we touch in the morning and the last things we touch at night, and toddlers grow up pinching and swiping before they can read, priorities have changed. As Apple’s chief designer Jony Ive recalls, when he and his team sat down to redesign the iPhone operating system in 2012, it did away with many of the classic skeuomorphic elements: “We understood that people had already become comfortable with touching glass, they didn’t need physical buttons, they understood the benefits. So there was an incredible liberty in not having to reference the physical world so literally. We were trying to create an environment that was less specific. It got design out of the way.” Having ignored design for a decade, Google recently united the graphical language of its different platforms with the launch of Material Design. In an exhibit that comes as a surprising time-warp, the paper and cardboard mock-ups of its new icons are on show, revealing how the design team modelled the new interface and developed lighting rigs to cast accurate shadows, with the aim of creating an illusion of layers of paper-like cards sliding around inside your device. It was a process that produced some interesting outcomes: why should buttons appear to press down when you touch the screen, when there’s no sense of pressing something beyond the glass? So instead they hover upwards, as if subject to a magical magnetic attraction from your finger. With Silicon Valley tech companies pumping increasingly hefty resources into voice recognition technology, McGetrick says the next frontier for user interface will be aural, building on our new surreal world of people shouting across the room to summon help from Siri, Alexa and Cortana. “We’re entering a new phase where we decreasingly need screens,” he says. “The trajectory of miniaturisation is crystal clear, from computers to laptops to digital organisers to phones to watches. The end-game is that technology will become invisible and we’ll have Google inside our heads.” California: Designing Freedom is at the Design Museum, London, 24 May–15 October.   Oliver Wainwright is the Guardian's architecture and design critic.

Google Phone 9.0 prepares to add Android O's Notification Channels, picture messaging, post-call messages, and more [APK Teardown] Cody Toombs Follow View All Posts 2017/05/02 5:00am PDTMay 2, 2017 77 Plus 1 on G+ 92 Share on Facebook 76 Share on Twitter Total Shares245 APK Teardown Applications Downloads News Update 1: 2017/05/10 3:16pm PDT Official changelog posted Article Contents 1 Teardown 1.1 Notification Channels for Android O 1.2 Post-call messaging 1.3 Convenient picture messaging 1.4 Motorola "hidden menu" dialer codes 1.5 Cat and dog paws? 2 Download Late last week, an update to Google's Phone app began rolling out with no immediately obvious changes to the experience. While users don't have anything to play with quite yet, there are several interesting hints about what is to come in future releases. Hidden among the app's resources are signs of support for Android O's new Notification Channels feature, in-call picture messaging, post-call messaging, hidden menu codes for Motorola phones, and even some odd images of paws. Yes, seriously. Update 1: 2017/05/10 3:16pm PDT Official changelog posted Google posted a changelog for the Phone app's latest update with the addition of emergency location display and "call waiting improvements" making up the majority of the new features. Emergency location display Call waiting improvements (accept second call and end ongoing call) Bug fixes Needless to say, I wasn't going to test anything that may relate to emergency services, but I did try testing the call waiting function. There weren't any visible changes for me, so it's possible these are really under-the-hood improvements or something that doesn't work on my cell carriers. End of Update Teardown Disclaimer: Teardowns are based on evidence found inside of apks (Android's application package) and are necessarily speculative and usually based on incomplete information. It's possible that the guesses made here are totally and completely wrong. Even when predictions are correct, there is always a chance that plans could change or may be canceled entirely. Much like rumors, nothing is certain until it's officially announced and released. The features discussed below are probably not live yet, or may only be live for a small percentage of users. Unless stated otherwise, don't expect to see these features if you install the apk. Notification Channels for Android O While it's a fairly small feature when compared to some of the improvements we've seen in many major OS updates, the Notification Channels brought to us by Android O are exciting. Most of Google's apps are still not implementing this addition to the API, but it's clearly in the works with the Phone app. While they don't appear to be fully implemented yet, names have been added to the latest apk update that describe six separate channels, including: Incoming calls, Ongoing calls, Missed calls, Voicemails, External calls, and Miscellaneous. <string name="notification_channel_incoming_call">Incoming calls</string> <string name="notification_channel_ongoing_call">Ongoing calls</string> <string name="notification_channel_missed_call">Missed calls</string> <string name="notification_channel_voicemail">Voicemails</string> <string name="notification_channel_external_call">External calls</string> <string name="notification_channel_misc">Miscellaneous</string> That's a pretty thorough list given the nature of the Phone app and the types of notifications it shows, especially since most users will probably never even see a couple of them. While the strings are there, only the standard Miscellaneous channel is visible in the notification settings screen for the Phone app. In all likelihood, the implementation probably wasn't complete when this update was built, so we can probably expect to see it in the next release, or possibly when the second developer preview image becomes available. Post-call messaging Receive a phone call today on almost any modern phone and you can probably tap or swipe something on the screen to reject it and immediately reply with a pre-written text message to say you're unavailable or will call back shortly. It can be a useful feature, even if it's just for those times when you're driving or stuck in a meeting. But what should the caller do if they don't get through? Leaving a voicemail is turning to be too cumbersome, so many people now send a text instead. New lines in this update suggest the same type of prepared text messages might be added for the caller, as well. There are a few new lines going into this feature, but three are the new, pre-written messages meant to convey varying degrees of importance. They are simple messages crafted to let the target of the call know that your needs are urgent, important but not time sensitive, or you just called to chat. <string name="post_call_add_message">Add message</string> <string name="post_call_message">Say why you called</string> <string name="post_call_message_1">This is urgent. Call me back.</string> <string name="post_call_message_2">Call me back when you have some time.</string> <string name="post_call_message_3">Not urgent, we can chat later.</string> <string name="post_call_message_sent">Message sent</string> There aren't any other clues to suggest how this feature will be presented to the caller or if a custom message can be written from the same screen, but it's likely this feature wasn't complete yet, either. Unless some clever tricks are necessary to make this feature smart, it seems like there probably won't have to be too much more work, so it may go live with the next update. Convenient picture messaging For many years, phone manufacturers have experimented with bringing certain features to the surface during calls so users don't have to spend too much time poking at their phone to do things that people are likely to need in the moment. One feature that has been popping up occasionally, even as far back as the days of dumb phones, was the ability to quickly take a picture and send it directly to the person in the same conversation. It looks like the same feature is probably destined for Google's Phone app. <string name="received_a_photo">Received a photo</string> <string name="sent_a_photo">Sent a photo</string> There are a few other strings possibly related to this feature, but the two above are the only ones that really matter. They represent the basic status messages to show a picture was sent or received. Again, it's not really clear if there are any clever features that make this a little smarter, but I have a hunch the Phone app will listen for messages containing images (I assume both MMS and RCS) and instead of making users switch to their messaging app, the photos will be shown automatically or with an on-screen button. Motorola "hidden menu" dialer codes Hacking around with a phone can be fun and enable a lot of powerful features, but it often involves a lot of secret methods that aren't intended for the public. Dialer codes have been used as one of the key methods for accessing special menus and functions. A long list of Motorola's dialer codes was included in the latest Phone update. Some of these are pretty old, but at least a few of them didn't turn up in any of my searches, so I thought some people might want to experiment with them. Disclaimer: Use of these dialer codes is done at your own risk. Some of these may damage your phone and/or void its warranty. You've been warned. If you want some information on many of these codes, you can find about 3/4 of them listed in this 2012 post by well-known security expert JCase. The behavior of the remaining codes is currently unknown and didn't turn up in my research. Only try them out if you know what you're doing and prepared for the possible consequences. code <string-array name="motorola_hidden_menu_key_sequence"> <item>\##66236#</item> <item>\##2539#</item> <item>\##786#</item> <item>\##72786#</item> <item>\##3282#</item> <item>\##33284#</item> <item>\##3424#</item> <item>\##564#</item> <item>\##4567257#</item> <item>\##873283#</item> <item>\##6343#</item> <item>\##27263#</item> <item>\##258#</item> <item>\##8422#</item> <item>\##4382#</item> </string-array> <string-array name="motorola_hidden_menu_key_pattern"> <item>\##[0-9]{6}#</item> </string-array> <string-array name="motorola_hidden_menu_key_pattern_intents"> <item>@string/motorola_hidden_menu_intent</item> </string-array> Cat and dog paws? Finally, a couple of quirky images were added to this update. A pair of paws, one belonging to a cat and the other to a dog, can now be found in the apk's resources. Note: Images were converted from webp to png. I'm not yet sure what they are used for, if they belong to an Easter egg, or maybe somebody at Google just wanted to make sure we were still watching. Both images have transparent backgrounds and look like they could be used for a simple animation where a paw reaches up to grab an object on the screen and drag it away. Whatever the case, ya gotta love the whimsy and humor.

Willie Chalmers III It would be interesting why this showed up in the phone app instead of the Google app, though. someone755 Google. Kieron Quinn http://i.imgur.com/y7tX9IY.png Nope, it's random Kieron Quinn I wonder if you can find what triggers the animation (if there is one) in the code, like the 0118 999 881 999 119 725 3 easter egg Rudresh did not do anything on my dialer Kieron Quinn It only works on the Google Phone app Andy J There is an IT Crowd easter egg?! 4Ui812 The Savannah cat . https://youtu.be/IVaiYSPn380 wickets any idea when O beta signup is opening? boop If imagine no sooner than I/O when they formally announce the update and walk through it's intended feature set. wickets google is soooo stingy with their beta's haha. I have it on my 6p, but on pixel SOL with the verizon version Lonerwithaboner420 Youve got O beta? How, I love to. wickets If you have a pixel or nexus just go to Google developers site and download Lonerwithaboner420 Thanks M Gordon "Only try them out if you know what you're and prepared for the possible consequences." Is there a mistake in there? Cody Toombs yep, I must have made a mistake in editing. Fixed it. Thanks KChristainsen Will this ever open up to non nexus devices? Gonzales Probably not. It would be nice for OEMs to give us a choice, but I doubt it will ever happen aRvInD Yes it will work, if you root, install GPhone as system app and make it default Phone app. Thats how I'm enjoying this on my Oneplus3...! DragoCubed Dog 🐅 and cat 🐈 paws. :3 awwwwww DynamikD That is definitely a tiger 🐅. DragoCubed I hate the Samsung emoji makapav I bet it will still not support sending call-reject text messages through Google Voice. Sigh... Kyle Salewski Yeah. Even hitting the Message button on a contact won't work. They really need to allow Voice to be the default SMS app makapav Well done bro. You're a fellow dedicated Google Voice user to figure that out and complain about it. I wanted to bring that use case here to my rant but figured probably no one else jumps through that hoop like me! ;-) Clearly Google has the laziest/clueless Android users on their team because some of these obvious use cases go unknown to them. chocolate_drizzle I think they should add seemless Google Duo integration by adding a video calling option in the app. What do you guys think? DynamikD I think you are on to something! 👍 bunchofpenguins Facetime does this where you can press a button and switch right to Facetime. I have been wanting this in Android forever. Chris My girlfriend and I enjoy using Duo all the time, so this would be perfect. But then Google would need to release their Phone app for all Android phones in the Play Store. Carson Saldanha No, they could just add support for it in their own. Andy J If the photo features are indeed for RCS (and sending photos while in a phone call is indeed a feature specifically detailed in the RCS spec) - then in the same way Messages is available to all Android phones, the phone app would also have to be on the store. And the Contacts app will probably go on too - because a key part of the RCS spec is that the phone address book will show which contacts have "enhanced messaging" available. Chris I hope so. I love the Google Dialer and Contacts but I have to use an old APK to get it to run on non Nexus or Pixel devices. Deeco Too logical for Google JG I could see where that could come in handy... However I'm not sure if Duo has picked up enough traction to really make it useful enough to integrate it into the dialer. If the recipient doesn't have Duo installed (as possibly would be the case the majority of the time - at least from personal experience) then a Duo video call button would just be extra clutter... Berni Hargrove But this is how you give it traction. Intuitively integrate it into a regularly used feature/app of the phone. The dialer is a perfect fit to help give Duo more relevance. Biga173rd Does this APK work with non pixel phones? Siddharth Nope except Nexus devices Biga173rd Thanks Cody Toombs It's meant for a few things people forget, but definitely not all phones. The full list should be: Pixel, Nexus, Android One, and Motorola. Carpentractor Ok, I have been experiencing a weird bug with my Pixel keypad while in call. Basically, the keypad gets smushed when accessing the keypad in call and it cuts off the letters ​under the numbers, which are sort of useful when spelling last names for extensions... It happened to me several updates ago and uninstalling all of the updates for the app and putting it back to how the phone came originally would fix that issue, but obviously take away any new features that have been added to the dialer. But, this time when I tried to uninstall the app updates, it didn't fix the issue! Everytime I see an update for the dialer, I get excited that they may have fixed it, but to no avail. My girlfriend has a Nexus 5X and she does not have the issue.

By any chance, are you running any 3rd party app(s) that also integrated into the dialer? Carpentractor I don't think so, I did have Skype installed at one point, but I did uninstall it. What kind of 3rd party apps might integrate with the dialer? I guess I can try to boot up in safe mode.... Rod What's your font size? Carpentractor Large. Carpentractor So, I changed my font back to default and it did solve the problem. Is there no way to have my font set to large and have the dialer format properly? My girlfriend has her font set to large with no issues on her 5x. This is whacky! Rod Have you changed the DPI? Carpentractor Not as far as anything beyond having my display size also set to large. Morenicano $5 says this will be a new messenger app by next year Richard Dennis and they will move half of Allo's features to it.. So you now need both apps... And hangouts is a new email app. Yuku Sugianto Why do Motorola codes appear on Google's Phone app? Probably the next Nexus/Pixel line phone will be made by Motorola, and Motorola service staff are already accustomed to those codes to diagnose problems. Cody Toombs Sorry to kill this theory, but Motorola has a arrangement with Google to use a lot of Google's first party apps. It's been in place basically since Google bought it and began shipping the Moto X with nearly stock AOSP with some product specific enhancements. As far as I am aware, all (or most?) Motorola phones use Google's Phone app. Even if that weren't the explanation, the Nexus 6 would be. I mean, a Moto-made Pixel could still happen, but these phone codes aren't evidence of that. Kevin Burton Could the "paws" be for sequence dialing? When a "pause" is entered you get a "paw" displayed on the phone? AintaDamnThingFunny I like the phone app. My only complaint is it's not the most intuitive thing on earth to try and answer/reject a call by swiping up/down. I routinely need 3 or 4 tries to get it. Or maybe it's just me? I think swiping side to side is easier. Maxr1998 "somebody at Google just wanted to make sure we we're still watching" - that one "we" seems to be too much 😜 SomeGuy112 I notice the button animation is gone when pressing the button to bring up the dialer now.

Google Phone 9.0 prepares to add Android O's Notification Channels, picture messaging, post-call messages, and more [APK Teardown] Cody Toombs Follow View All Posts 2017/05/02 5:00am PDTMay 2, 2017 77 Plus 1 on G+ 92 Share on Facebook 76 Share on Twitter Total Shares245 APK Teardown Applications Downloads News Update 1: 2017/05/10 3:16pm PDT Official changelog posted Article Contents 1 Teardown 1.1 Notification Channels for Android O 1.2 Post-call messaging 1.3 Convenient picture messaging 1.4 Motorola "hidden menu" dialer codes 1.5 Cat and dog paws? 2 Download Late last week, an update to Google's Phone app began rolling out with no immediately obvious changes to the experience. While users don't have anything to play with quite yet, there are several interesting hints about what is to come in future releases. Hidden among the app's resources are signs of support for Android O's new Notification Channels feature, in-call picture messaging, post-call messaging, hidden menu codes for Motorola phones, and even some odd images of paws. Yes, seriously. Update 1: 2017/05/10 3:16pm PDT Official changelog posted Google posted a changelog for the Phone app's latest update with the addition of emergency location display and "call waiting improvements" making up the majority of the new features. Emergency location display Call waiting improvements (accept second call and end ongoing call) Bug fixes Needless to say, I wasn't going to test anything that may relate to emergency services, but I did try testing the call waiting function. There weren't any visible changes for me, so it's possible these are really under-the-hood improvements or something that doesn't work on my cell carriers. End of Update Teardown Disclaimer: Teardowns are based on evidence found inside of apks (Android's application package) and are necessarily speculative and usually based on incomplete information. It's possible that the guesses made here are totally and completely wrong. Even when predictions are correct, there is always a chance that plans could change or may be canceled entirely. Much like rumors, nothing is certain until it's officially announced and released. The features discussed below are probably not live yet, or may only be live for a small percentage of users. Unless stated otherwise, don't expect to see these features if you install the apk. Notification Channels for Android O While it's a fairly small feature when compared to some of the improvements we've seen in many major OS updates, the Notification Channels brought to us by Android O are exciting. Most of Google's apps are still not implementing this addition to the API, but it's clearly in the works with the Phone app. While they don't appear to be fully implemented yet, names have been added to the latest apk update that describe six separate channels, including: Incoming calls, Ongoing calls, Missed calls, Voicemails, External calls, and Miscellaneous. <string name="notification_channel_incoming_call">Incoming calls</string> <string name="notification_channel_ongoing_call">Ongoing calls</string> <string name="notification_channel_missed_call">Missed calls</string> <string name="notification_channel_voicemail">Voicemails</string> <string name="notification_channel_external_call">External calls</string> <string name="notification_channel_misc">Miscellaneous</string> That's a pretty thorough list given the nature of the Phone app and the types of notifications it shows, especially since most users will probably never even see a couple of them. While the strings are there, only the standard Miscellaneous channel is visible in the notification settings screen for the Phone app. In all likelihood, the implementation probably wasn't complete when this update was built, so we can probably expect to see it in the next release, or possibly when the second developer preview image becomes available. Post-call messaging Receive a phone call today on almost any modern phone and you can probably tap or swipe something on the screen to reject it and immediately reply with a pre-written text message to say you're unavailable or will call back shortly. It can be a useful feature, even if it's just for those times when you're driving or stuck in a meeting. But what should the caller do if they don't get through? Leaving a voicemail is turning to be too cumbersome, so many people now send a text instead. New lines in this update suggest the same type of prepared text messages might be added for the caller, as well. There are a few new lines going into this feature, but three are the new, pre-written messages meant to convey varying degrees of importance. They are simple messages crafted to let the target of the call know that your needs are urgent, important but not time sensitive, or you just called to chat. <string name="post_call_add_message">Add message</string> <string name="post_call_message">Say why you called</string> <string name="post_call_message_1">This is urgent. Call me back.</string> <string name="post_call_message_2">Call me back when you have some time.</string> <string name="post_call_message_3">Not urgent, we can chat later.</string> <string name="post_call_message_sent">Message sent</string> There aren't any other clues to suggest how this feature will be presented to the caller or if a custom message can be written from the same screen, but it's likely this feature wasn't complete yet, either. Unless some clever tricks are necessary to make this feature smart, it seems like there probably won't have to be too much more work, so it may go live with the next update. Convenient picture messaging For many years, phone manufacturers have experimented with bringing certain features to the surface during calls so users don't have to spend too much time poking at their phone to do things that people are likely to need in the moment. One feature that has been popping up occasionally, even as far back as the days of dumb phones, was the ability to quickly take a picture and send it directly to the person in the same conversation. It looks like the same feature is probably destined for Google's Phone app. <string name="received_a_photo">Received a photo</string> <string name="sent_a_photo">Sent a photo</string> There are a few other strings possibly related to this feature, but the two above are the only ones that really matter. They represent the basic status messages to show a picture was sent or received. Again, it's not really clear if there are any clever features that make this a little smarter, but I have a hunch the Phone app will listen for messages containing images (I assume both MMS and RCS) and instead of making users switch to their messaging app, the photos will be shown automatically or with an on-screen button. Motorola "hidden menu" dialer codes Hacking around with a phone can be fun and enable a lot of powerful features, but it often involves a lot of secret methods that aren't intended for the public. Dialer codes have been used as one of the key methods for accessing special menus and functions. A long list of Motorola's dialer codes was included in the latest Phone update. Some of these are pretty old, but at least a few of them didn't turn up in any of my searches, so I thought some people might want to experiment with them. Disclaimer: Use of these dialer codes is done at your own risk. Some of these may damage your phone and/or void its warranty. You've been warned. If you want some information on many of these codes, you can find about 3/4 of them listed in this 2012 post by well-known security expert JCase. The behavior of the remaining codes is currently unknown and didn't turn up in my research. Only try them out if you know what you're doing and prepared for the possible consequences. code <string-array name="motorola_hidden_menu_key_sequence"> <item>\##66236#</item> <item>\##2539#</item> <item>\##786#</item> <item>\##72786#</item> <item>\##3282#</item> <item>\##33284#</item> <item>\##3424#</item> <item>\##564#</item> <item>\##4567257#</item> <item>\##873283#</item> <item>\##6343#</item> <item>\##27263#</item> <item>\##258#</item> <item>\##8422#</item> <item>\##4382#</item> </string-array> <string-array name="motorola_hidden_menu_key_pattern"> <item>\##[0-9]{6}#</item> </string-array> <string-array name="motorola_hidden_menu_key_pattern_intents"> <item>@string/motorola_hidden_menu_intent</item> </string-array> Cat and dog paws? Finally, a couple of quirky images were added to this update. A pair of paws, one belonging to a cat and the other to a dog, can now be found in the apk's resources. Note: Images were converted from webp to png. I'm not yet sure what they are used for, if they belong to an Easter egg, or maybe somebody at Google just wanted to make sure we were still watching. Both images have transparent backgrounds and look like they could be used for a simple animation where a paw reaches up to grab an object on the screen and drag it away. Whatever the case, ya gotta love the whimsy and humor.

It would be nice for OEMs to give us a choice, but I doubt it will ever happen aRvInD Yes it will work, if you root, install GPhone as system app and make it default Phone app. Thats how I'm enjoying this on my Oneplus3...! DragoCubed Dog 🐅 and cat 🐈 paws. :3 awwwwww DynamikD That is definitely a tiger 🐅. DragoCubed I hate the Samsung emoji makapav I bet it will still not support sending call-reject text messages through Google Voice. Sigh... Kyle Salewski Yeah. Even hitting the Message button on a contact won't work. They really need to allow Voice to be the default SMS app makapav Well done bro. You're a fellow dedicated Google Voice user to figure that out and complain about it. I wanted to bring that use case here to my rant but figured probably no one else jumps through that hoop like me! ;-) Clearly Google has the laziest/clueless Android users on their team because some of these obvious use cases go unknown to them. chocolate_drizzle I think they should add seemless Google Duo integration by adding a video calling option in the app. What do you guys think? DynamikD I think you are on to something! 👍 bunchofpenguins Facetime does this where you can press a button and switch right to Facetime. I have been wanting this in Android forever. Chris My girlfriend and I enjoy using Duo all the time, so this would be perfect. But then Google would need to release their Phone app for all Android phones in the Play Store. Carson Saldanha No, they could just add support for it in their own. Andy J If the photo features are indeed for RCS (and sending photos while in a phone call is indeed a feature specifically detailed in the RCS spec) - then in the same way Messages is available to all Android phones, the phone app would also have to be on the store. And the Contacts app will probably go on too - because a key part of the RCS spec is that the phone address book will show which contacts have "enhanced messaging" available. Chris I hope so. I love the Google Dialer and Contacts but I have to use an old APK to get it to run on non Nexus or Pixel devices. Deeco Too logical for Google JG I could see where that could come in handy... However I'm not sure if Duo has picked up enough traction to really make it useful enough to integrate it into the dialer. If the recipient doesn't have Duo installed (as possibly would be the case the majority of the time - at least from personal experience) then a Duo video call button would just be extra clutter... Berni Hargrove But this is how you give it traction. Intuitively integrate it into a regularly used feature/app of the phone. The dialer is a perfect fit to help give Duo more relevance. Biga173rd Does this APK work with non pixel phones? Siddharth Nope except Nexus devices Biga173rd Thanks Cody Toombs It's meant for a few things people forget, but definitely not all phones. The full list should be: Pixel, Nexus, Android One, and Motorola. Carpentractor Ok, I have been experiencing a weird bug with my Pixel keypad while in call. Basically, the keypad gets smushed when accessing the keypad in call and it cuts off the letters ​under the numbers, which are sort of useful when spelling last names for extensions... It happened to me several updates ago and uninstalling all of the updates for the app and putting it back to how the phone came originally would fix that issue, but obviously take away any new features that have been added to the dialer. But, this time when I tried to uninstall the app updates, it didn't fix the issue! Everytime I see an update for the dialer, I get excited that they may have fixed it, but to no avail. My girlfriend has a Nexus 5X and she does not have the issue. I have attached a screenshot, please let me know if anyone has a solution or is even experiencing the issue. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/dd8b277825ef665ffa607ce2aa8b3a0004b8109cba32e68655dcd11afd7834ec.png DynamikD I, personally, have never experienced this and I have the same device as you. By any chance, are you running any 3rd party app(s) that also integrated into the dialer? Carpentractor I don't think so, I did have Skype installed at one point, but I did uninstall it. What kind of 3rd party apps might integrate with the dialer? I guess I can try to boot up in safe mode.... Rod What's your font size? Carpentractor Large. Carpentractor So, I changed my font back to default and it did solve the problem. Is there no way to have my font set to large and have the dialer format properly? My girlfriend has her font set to large with no issues on her 5x. This is whacky! Rod Have you changed the DPI? Carpentractor Not as far as anything beyond having my display size also set to large. Morenicano $5 says this will be a new messenger app by next year Richard Dennis and they will move half of Allo's features to it.. So you now need both apps... And hangouts is a new email app. Yuku Sugianto Why do Motorola codes appear on Google's Phone app? Probably the next Nexus/Pixel line phone will be made by Motorola, and Motorola service staff are already accustomed to those codes to diagnose problems. Cody Toombs Sorry to kill this theory, but Motorola has a arrangement with Google to use a lot of Google's first party apps. It's been in place basically since Google bought it and began shipping the Moto X with nearly stock AOSP with some product specific enhancements. As far as I am aware, all (or most?) Motorola phones use Google's Phone app. Even if that weren't the explanation, the Nexus 6 would be. I mean, a Moto-made Pixel could still happen, but these phone codes aren't evidence of that. Kevin Burton Could the "paws" be for sequence dialing? When a "pause" is entered you get a "paw" displayed on the phone? AintaDamnThingFunny I like the phone app. My only complaint is it's not the most intuitive thing on earth to try and answer/reject a call by swiping up/down. I routinely need 3 or 4 tries to get it. Or maybe it's just me? I think swiping side to side is easier. Maxr1998 "somebody at Google just wanted to make sure we we're still watching" - that one "we" seems to be too much 😜 SomeGuy112 I notice the button animation is gone when pressing the button to bring up the dialer now.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 11 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Report: More than half of consumers use online searches before buying Do you remember the first time you Googled something? Online search has come far since then—and it’s not just the advertising models. Google’s algorithm has become phenomenally complex. There are entire careers that are built on figuring out how to have content appear on top. Though online search has become ubiquitous, many consumers in the United States aren’t completely satisfied with their online search experience, a recent study from SearchDex revealed. The company’s 2017 Google Game Survey found that 58 percent of U.S. consumers search a product online before making a purchase, and more than a quarter of them seek online reviews. Consumers also use digital searches to find various retailer options (26 percent), compare prices (25 percent) and find physical retail store locations (19 percent). [RELATED: Attend the PR Now & Next Conference to learn today’s essential skills and tomorrow’s tools for transforming your PR results.] One third of U.S. consumers report that their shopping experiences begin with a search engine. That’s higher than retailer websites (20 percent), retail store websites (18 percent) and brand websites (15 percent). As mentioned, digital search results still aren’t perfect. This is due, in large part, to unsavory marketing and SEO tactics. Some brand managers are able to game the system and get eyes on their organizations’ sites when it’s not necessarily warranted. Sneaky moves come at a price, though. You might get more clicks on your website when gaming the system, but 31 percent of consumers say they’re less likely to buy from a website that is found through misleading search results. SearchDex revealed a number or additional annoyances to consumers who search online: 39 percent dislike targeted ads 21 percent are annoyed by outdated search results 18 percent report that their desired result not on first page of search results 17 percent are frustrated by slow load times 12 percent say the description of search result is unclear 10 percent complain that the key search term is missing There’s also concern about security. More than half of consumers (68 percent) say they’re concerned about their browser history being sold. How might this data affect your next digital or content marketing effort?

Not Much With enough money, a new study suggests, these industries were able to buy legislators' votes. By John Light | May 3, 2017 How Much Does It Cost to Buy a [...] Protesters march past the FCC headquarters in 2014, demanding that the agency protect net neutrality. (Photo by Bill O'Leary/The Washington Post via Getty Images) Back in 2006, Democrat Ed Markey, then a congressman and now a senator from Massachusetts, introduced an amendment to protect net neutrality, the dull name for the important idea that all internet traffic be treated equally by internet service providers. This legislation, it turned out, was a cash cow for Congress. Large telecommunication companies wanted to prevent Markey’s protections from being put in place, since it would constrain their business. Companies like Google and Netflix, on the other hand, wanted to make sure the protections were put in place, since they would protect their business. Without net neutrality protections, the telecommunication companies could regulate how quickly sites like Google and Netflix loaded for their customers — or whether their customers were able to access the sites at all. MORE ON Inequality A Primer: Just What Is Net Neutrality — and Why All the Fuss? BY BillMoyers.com Staff | April 25, 2017 A new report from the Roosevelt Institute, a progressive think tank, uses the battle that unfolded over this 2006 legislation to illustrate a larger point: That with enough money, companies can buy legislators’ votes. In this example, of course, party played a big role in how members of Congress voted: Democrats largely supported net neutrality, Republicans largely didn’t. The partisan split remains today. But money also played a determining role, the Roosevelt Institute’s researchers found. For every $1,000 given by a company like Netflix or Google, the likelihood that a member of Congress would vote for the legislation increased by 24 percent. For every $1,000 given by companies that opposed net neutrality, the chances that a legislator would vote against the legislation increased by 2.6 percent. The amendment failed, though President Barack Obama’s Federal Communications Commission later secured net neutrality without Congress’ help. (It is, however, now under threat again by President Donald Trump’s FCC chair.) The Roosevelt Institute study that came up with this cost-per-vote analysis is one of a kind. It’s very hard to track influence, and it only got more difficult to do so after 2010, when new species of nonprofit began to populate the political spending ecosystem in the wake of the Supreme Court’s Citizens United decision. Interconnected super PACs, LLCs, party-affiliated groups, think tanks and dark money nonprofits allowed donors to pass limitless and often anonymous sums through a financial labyrinth, making it near-impossible, in some cases, for journalists and citizens to track which special interest was influencing which vote. For every $100,000 a House Democrat received from the financial industry, the odds that they would break with their party and oppose an aspect of Dodd-Frank increased by 13.9 percent. But, in the new study, political scientists Thomas Ferguson and Paul Jorgensen and statistician Jie Chen have done the work to document how money influences Congress. The authors of this study attempted to take all of the post-Citizens United groups into account — candidate campaign committees, party committees, dark money groups, SuperPACs and others. In addition to the 2006 vote on net neutrality, the researchers examined how members of Congress voted on the Dodd-Frank financial reforms, which passed Congress in 2010 and were meant to rein in some of the Wall Street excesses that contributed to the financial crisis. The Democratic Party largely supported Dodd-Frank — some of its strictest provisions were the handiwork of progressive senators like Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Sherrod Brown (D-OH). But the researchers found that for every $100,000 a House Democrat received from the financial industry, the odds that the legislator in question would break with the party and oppose an aspect of Dodd-Frank increased by 13.9 percent. The researchers also found that the temptation of a spin through the revolving door may have played a role in how members of Congress voted on Dodd-Frank. Legislators who left the House in 2014 were much more likely to side with the banks in their votes, because, the researchers suggest, they were considering where their future paychecks might come from. “Taken as a whole, the pattern [the two case studies] display is too obvious to need much emphasis,” the researchers write. “Substantial numbers of legislators sell out the public interest in exchange for political money.” Political money also ensures that the politicians favored by corporations have the money they need to campaign hard for reelection and hold onto their office, the researchers write. That may mean that those who retain their seats are more friendly to well-heeled interests. Because of the amount of money they have, and their willingness to spend it on political issues that could affect their bottom line, the telecommunications industry and the financial industry are two of the most influential constituencies in Washington — a fact demonstrated by the never-ending battles over financial regulation and net neutrality, both of which have lobbyists gearing up, once again, in an effort to push a new bushel of corporate favors through Congress and onto Trump’s desk in 2017.

If you can use Google, you can use artificial intelligence on your next case. By Catalyst May 11, 2017 at 10:19 AM Shares8 If you’ve used Google to find a song with just a few words from a lyric or searched Netflix to pick out a comedy that’s safe to watch with kids, you have used applied machine learning. Machine learning is an area of artificial intelligence that enables computers to self-learn, without being explicitly programmed, to look for specific pieces of information. When lawyers use machine learning for discovery or internal investigations, it’s commonly called technology assisted review (TAR) or predictive coding. Although TAR has been around for a while, lawyers and litigation support professionals still have questions about how to best use it on individual cases. Are you ready to test your knowledge? How would you answer 10 of the most common questions about TAR? What are the thresholds for using TAR? How can you prove a negative—that a document doesn’t exist? Should you use randomly selected documents to train the system? How does TAR handle ‘bad’ decisions by reviewers? If you are halfway through review, can you switch to TAR? Is there a fail-safe to prevent a party from skewing results? Can you add docs once you’ve started a TAR project?   How can TAR help find what you don’t know? How do you know when to stop the review? How much time and money would TAR save on a review? How did you do on the quiz? How many of the questions were you able to answer confidently? The truth is, some of these questions are susceptible to multiple answers and approaches. That’s why Catalyst, an e-discovery company that specializes in search technology, compiled a book with detailed answers to questions that its experts receive about TAR. The book, Ask Catalyst: A User’s Guide to TAR, is available for free at this link. It offers detailed answers to 20 basic and advanced questions about TAR, and particularly about advanced TAR 2.0 using continuous active learning. A User’s Guide is Catalyst’s second book about TAR. The first book, TAR for Smart People, is an in-depth look at how TAR works and why it matters for legal professionals. It’s also available via a free download here.   Shares8 Topics Artificial Intelligence, Ask Catalyst, Catalyst, ebook, eDiscovery, Quiz, sponsored post, TAR, technology-assisted review Love ATL?

Attendees will be able to go to technical talks, listen to Google employees share their insights and enjoy a hands-on experience. The dates are 17 to 19 May and it's held at the Shoreline Ampitheatre in Mountain View, California. If you're heading to the conference then you can look at the schedule, which was released recently. If you're not going you can look at it anyway and try not to get jealous. To register for the conference you must have received an email asking you to register, although the time to apply for tickets has now shut. However, Google will provide a livestream so you can enjoy watching what it unveils, which is almost the same as being there, right? The most important part of I/O is seeing what announcements Google will make about what it plans to release in the coming year. So what should you look out for? Read on below. The Schedule The full schedule for the event can be found here on the website for the conference. Some events to keep an eye out for are: What's new in Android?:17 May 2-3pm will probably be a very popular session at this year's I/O. This is where you will see the Android O developer preview and "other new and exciting developments". Android Wear: Whats new & Best practices: 18 May 9:30-10:30am. The description for the event begins with "The Android Wear team has been busy since Wear 2.0". You should definitely not miss this event. Machine Learning APIs by Example: 19 May 9:30-10:30am This is all about Google's Cloud Platform and how it can help improve your business applications. Android O Google should drop some new much awaited details about Android O. Hopefully developers will be able to experience the Android O Beta at the event and maybe even play around with it. Of course, hopefully Google will tell us what the "O" stands for (Oreo? Orange?). Android Wear Android Wear is the operating system powering smart watches from manufacturers like Samsung, Sony and Huawei. Google is serious about wearables and what it could do with are new partners to launch a new range of devices. What better way than making an announcement at I/O and let consumers and developers alike what it plans to do? We%u2019ve been counting down to #io17 for 2+ months w/ slashes, pies, chaos and lightsabers... 1 WEEK LEFT! May 17-19 https://t.co/nhadA6BG2l pic.twitter.com/aHNMg8nt6E — Google Developers (@googledevs) May 10, 2017 Google Home The Google Home was introduced at last year's I/O and this year we could see an update to the device or potentially new features. Amazon recently announced its new Amazon Echo Show which is different to other home AI devices as it has a screen. Will Google counter Amazon's daring new video calling enabled device? Google could add phone calling to the Home too, something Amazon already has announced for Alexa. Pixel The Google Pixel and Pixel XL were the company's first smartphones that it designed and built from scratch. Unfortunately, they didn't take off as well as the company wanted them to, so it will now be looking to change this with a follow up device. There could be a new Pixel phone announced according to rumours, but whether this will be at I/O remains to be seen.

SearchDex revealed a number or additional annoyances to consumers who search online: 39 percent dislike targeted ads 21 percent are annoyed by outdated search results 18 percent report that their desired result not on first page of search results 17 percent are frustrated by slow load times 12 percent say the description of search result is unclear 10 percent complain that the key search term is missing There’s also concern about security. More than half of consumers (68 percent) say they’re concerned about their browser history being sold. How might this data affect your next digital or content marketing effort?

Chrome Dev has a new search widget you can try out Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/05/11 8:15am PDTMay 11, 2017 3 Plus 1 on G+ 34 Share on Facebook 40 Share on Twitter Total Shares77 Applications News Google apparently thinks you don't have enough ways to search Google on your phone. On my Pixel, I have the Google search 'pill' on the home screen, and Google Assistant if I hold down on the home button or use 'OK Google.' If you have Chrome Dev, you can use a new search widget as well. All joking aside, I can see this being useful for some people. Tapping on the widget instantly opens Chrome with the address bar highlighted, so while you can use it for basic searches, you can also use it to open websites without tapping on Chrome first. And since it uses Chrome's address bar search, it will use whatever search engine you have selected in Chrome. The widget was developed as part of an anti-trust lawsuit settlement in Russia, where Yandex claimed Google had violated local competition rules. The terms of the agreement required Google to offer a search widget that could change search engines, which will replace the standard Google search widget for Russian devices. You can try this for yourself by downloading Chrome Dev (or Canary), then dragging the new 4x1 widget to the home screen. I don't think I'll ever use it, but it's there if you want it.

Eric It's real. https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/17/google-reaches-7-8-million-settlement-in-its-android-antitrust-case-in-russia/ "In addition, the agreement states that Google will develop a new Chrome widget for Android devices already being used in Russia, which will replace the standard Google search widget on the home screen and allow users to see the new “choice screen” when it’s launched." Corbin Davenport Thanks for the link, I've added it to the post. Shining Wing Oh yeah, that makes sense. AP should probably revise the article to mention that it lets you use different search providers, since that's what it's really there for. King_Android Yessss, been waiting on this search feature.... F4LL0U7 This is amazing, I've been dreaming of a Google search bar on my home screen for years. Kawshik Ahmed This is created because Google promised Russian authorities that they will let 3rd party Search Engine on Android homescreen via Google Chrome Search Widget. Willie Chalmers III Really? That's interesting. Who is this info from? Kawshik Ahmed It was on news every where few weeks ago Kawshik Ahmed The reason Google created this widget because after they lost the Anti Trust case, Google made a deal with Russian Authorities that they will let 3rd party Search Engines in Android Home Screen via new Google Chrome Search Widget. They are just keeping their promise. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/4b6cf24bff8ed22d693ebe536bd4ff92a9efe7876c5a173f1541bb6c3c429287.png https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/8929a64a1e973914b0b4b23a5cfe5f75d8e3a5727f097d81c1bef38a947cd7f8.png https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/4e993db7f9fc815e53314498ef80bdd53359a121a49fd376618b387ba98e6892.png https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/6560cec28f50ccee765f2173480161b91001ac1f2e03ab20b744e959d85a693d.png https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/664448c4b0b1f60e724477c9d5c26687e22eca14d2fa5a4ed65db0372c1305b9.png 雷安德逻 Talking about Chrome, anyone noticied the new icon on Chrome Beta?

How To Enable The Handwriting Keyboard On Android Wear 2.0 Preview 1 Cody Toombs Follow View All Posts 2016/05/23 12:10pm PDTMay 23, 2016 19 Plus 1 on G+ 25 Share on Facebook 0 Share on Twitter Total Shares44 Android Wear News Tips & Tutorials After Google released the Android Wear 2.0 Preview images for the Huawei Watch and LG Watch Urbane 2nd Edition, many of us quickly flashed the firmware onto our watches to test out the new features. Most of the major changes are pretty easy to find, and some could even be said to be a little in-your-face. However, we saw quite a few people were confused by what seemed to be the absence of the handwriting keyboard. It turns out that it's just not enabled by default on the preview firmware. While it's not exactly buried, knowing that it has to be activated and where to go isn't very intuitive; so we've made a quick how-to guide for those that got a little lost. Disclaimer: These steps work on Android Wear 2.0 Preview 1, and may not match precisely in future releases. Enabling The Handwriting Keyboard Step 1 – Get to the right settings screen Start by launching the Settings app. This can be done either by pulling down the quick settings panel while the watchface is showing or by launching it from the app drawer. Once in Settings, find Input Methods in the list and open it. Now tap on the 3-dot option that lists the "Current" keyboard. Notice the list only contains Google Keyboard. Tap the button labeled CHOOSE KEYBOARDS. Step 2 – Enable and switch to the Handwriting keyboard At this point, you should be looking at a screen with a couple sliding toggles. The Handwriting toggle is probably disabled and the Google Keyboard toggle is enabled. Tap the Handwriting line to switch it to enabled if it isn't already, then back out to the previous screen using the hardware button. The list of keyboards now contains Handwriting, but the big white dot is still set to Google Keyboard. Tap the Handwriting line to switch the selector to that keyboard, then hit the hardware button to back out one more step. Note: At this point, the handwriting keyboard is enabled and selected. The next step is optional. Step 3 – Manage Handwriting keyboard settings If it wasn't obvious before (and it isn't), the items on the Input Methods screen after the 3-dot item are shortcuts to the individual Settings for each keyboard. Tap on the Handwriting keyboard to make some selections. (Yeah, this settings screen isn't even remotely optimized for round displays.) The list of options include a language selector and options to send handwriting samples and usage statistics back to Google. Usage statistics are enabled by default, but the samples are not. Make changes as you see fit. Step 4 – Using the keyboard Anytime a text input option becomes available, a screen with three icons will appear. From left to right, they are a microphone for voice dictation, a smiley for emoji entry, and a keyboard for text input with whatever keyboard you've selected. Tap the keyboard to start the handwriting input. Tip: Long-press on the keyboard icon to quickly switch between keyboards without going back to the Settings screen. Using the Handwriting keyboard is really straight-forward, especially if you've seen the demos. You simply use a finger to draw letters, numbers, and symbols. Once you start drawing, the text will slide away to the left (or presumably to the right for RTL languages). Short pauses or larger gaps between words can help the keyboard figure out where spaces belong. There's a backspace key at the bottom-left that will delete a single character with a tap or many characters with a press-and-hold. There's a confirmation button in the form of a checkmark to the right. That's about it. Have fun with the Wear 2.0 Preview!

Cody Toombs I haven't poked around at the apk, but I've got a feeling it's the regular handwriting keyboard with just enough extra code to perform the sliding effect, show those couple of buttons, and maybe make a few other obligatory tweaks for the watch. Jared K RIP in piece LG G Watch R :( Protoss That's a preview just saying... specs are the same on the G Watch R and the Huawei Watch, and even if they dont release 2.0 on the G Watch R we still have XDA Jared K I know, im just sad that they didn't give us a preview build. Ted Voltolina Is there a question about 2.0 coming to GWaR or not? I thought they said at I/O that it would be coming to "everybody" soon. Cody Toombs Do you know when/where that was said? I've tried to keep up with everything, but so much came out of there last week. Ted Voltolina I could have sworn Sundar said it in the keynote during the bit on Wear 2.0. It was either him or the specialist who came out to talk about Wear 2.0. But I'm pretty sure it was during the keynote. Cody Toombs Hmm, ok. I'll probably rewatch that sometime this week anyway. Just curious since I've started to have my doubts about this update reaching everybody. The ostensible requirement for a hardware button and a couple of features that seem to demand a little more screen real estate have me wondering how well this will work out on the original G Watch and a few others like it. Ted Voltolina David Singleton said it here. At least that's how I'm interpreting it, what do you think? https://youtu.be/862r3XS2YB0?t=1h24m15s Cody Toombs I don't know... That could be a lot like the announcements for a new version of Android where they say "everyone" can get it in the Fall. What they really mean is most people will get it in the Winter or Spring, and many others won't get it at all. It could totally go both ways. I'm hoping it hits every watch, but not holding the highest of expectations because some concessions will have to be made somewhere to get all of the different watches to work with what we can currently see in Wear 2.0. Ted Voltolina Do you think it helps the G Watch R's case that it has the same specs as the Huawei Watch, which is one of the two watches that are getting the 2.0 dev preview? Robin The R will get it for sure imo. The only ones I have doubts about are the original G Watch and the Moto 360 Gen1 (which I own) because of the lack of a hardware button/has a underpowered omap cpu FroodyFrog Look at http://www.lg.com/uk/smart-watches/lg-W110 under Tech Specs. It says it supports AW 2.0 I know that this is the UK site, but the point still remains. (US one just says AW) Ted Voltolina Good find! I hope that's the case. G Watch R is the most affordable circular watch without a flat tire, and it does what I need it to do. I'm very reluctant to upgrade as long as it keeps getting updates (and doesn't break). To me, it's the Nexus 5 of Android watches. cbn4forums There is no way I am going to try to hand-write anything on my watch when I can easily pull out my phone and do it better. Stephen Cornwell It's great for short replies. How do you define better? whispy_snippet While I don't own an Android wear device, the handwriting input method seems perfect for a smart watch. I feel like it should be the default input method. It's simple and intuitive enough to quickly type out a short "there in five" or "I'm running late" but not powerful enough to tempt someone to write a lengthy email (like a keyboard does). Stephen Cornwell Couldn't agree more. I use voice replies on my watch when appropriate and now handwriting for quick replies when it's not. It's actually quicker than a voice reply for a short "ok". Francois Nguyen I am on Wear 2.0 on my LG Urbane v1. I currently use FlickKey Keyboard on the watch to answer back from SMS or from Whatsapp. It's doable. I actually make a habit of typing from that from now on. Just need to redo muscle memory because I have to "flick" on the keyboard instead of "typing". (A flick is like a MUCH shorter swipe.) icyhotmike The GWR will get Wear 2.0 The hardware is very capable of supporting it. FroodyFrog LG UK pretty much confirmed it (look under tech specs): http://www.lg.com/uk/smart-watches/lg-W110 icyhotmike That pretty much proves it. Good find. VCat24 Yeeeeesss Dave How are the Google Now cards handled under Wear 2.0? How do they look like now? Right now they are displayed very unintuitive I think. Geoff Johnson There are no more "cards". You get a little animation on a new notification, and when you swipe up you see a full screen page with that notification. Dave But all this Google Now content (weather, sports scores, ETA to work and so on) still has to be somewhere, no? Right now this is bundled under one card and when you want to see all that information you have to click on it first. Geoff Johnson I used to get them before but I have not seen those useless Now cards since I upgraded to 2.0 Wontime Nice Alex Espinosa I'm debating on upgrading my Moto 360 1st gen to a new smartwatch to take advantage of the upcoming update. Is it worth the upgrade now or hang on to my current watch until a new watch is announced? Dave I'd suggest you wait until the first batch of watches with AW 2.0 out of the box is announced. If you don't like any of these you can still buy an older one. Until AW 2.0 is officially out it still takes some time anyway. Cody Toombs It sorta depends on what you're trying to get. If you want the latest and greatest, so to speak, I too suggest waiting. It works a lot like phones, but since watches are so new to the market, the timeline is shorter. The Huawei Watch is over 6 months old, and the Urbane 2nd edition existed for about as long (though released super late). There are new processors coming to watches very soon, and those are going to be more powerful and more power-efficient. On the other side of it, if you're more interested in saving a bit of money while still enjoying the ride with Android Wear, I'd suggest waiting for a sale or price drop on the Huawei Watch or Urbane 2nd edition, or even the 2nd gen Moto 360 (depending on which looks best to you). I haven't tried the others, but I really like the Huawei Watch. it's monumentally better than the 1st gen 360. But if you're not going to target the absolute latest releases, let your upgrade timing coincide with some good savings which can go toward another upgrade down the line. FroodyFrog I'm fairly pleased with the Huawei Watch. Could I get better battery life with a newer watch down the road? Most likely, especially since like you said the new processors will be used. However, for $150, the Huawei Watch is a great deal, so I'm not complaining. With the announcement of AW 2.0 though, there aren't any features which I am not getting. After all, it's not like they announced NFC support for mobile payments. I feel like the only advantage the next round of watches will have over the Huawei Watch is better battery life. If that's true, then I can see myself holding onto it until some time in late 2017, if not later. (I feel like there's room for a pun here, and I apologize for that.) Robin Where did you get the Huawei Watch for $150? 😯. That's something I would also be willing to spend. On other thoughts, something the next generation will have is LTE, although it's debatable if it is worth it. But I personally would love LTE on my watch, so I could leaf my phone at home while running. FroodyFrog To answer your question if it's worth it, I personally wouldn't spring for the next gen if LTE is the only main difference. I'm pleased with the HWatch, and can't see myself upgrading just yet. Then again, I said the same thing with the LG G Watch. I think this because I usually have my phone with me anyways, so standalone GPS and LTE is somewhat unnecessary for me. Robin OK, thanks :) Just one more thing: where did you get the Huawei watch for $150? FroodyFrog What I said is my own situation. I'm assuming that numerous people would feel otherwise (I.e that it's worth it to upgrade from an HWatch to someone from the next batch) Robin .? FroodyFrog Last week I tried flashing AW 2.0 to my Huawei Watch. The flash-all script crashed every time I tried running it, so I manually flashed each image. Watch didn't boot (must have left out a file), so I went back to 1.4 (having to manually flash each image because the script didn't like me) Anyways... a few hours ago, I decided to flash the various images again, and it worked. I'm not a fan of the full screen notifications, although I do like the bit on the side to show how far down the menu I am. Google search works in the sense that it recognizes my commands, but it doesn't actually do anything else (i.e open apps or do a web search). I have mixed feelings about the way to change watch faces; I like that it only shows the ones which I select from my list of faces through the watch list (like a favorites menu), but for them to change it to swipe left/right from main screen is where I have mixed feelings. I do like the fact that now there's it has a keyboard with the handwriting input (as I do longer need to use 3rd party keyboards, since I either need another xposed module to use it, or another app + xposed module to use a 3rd party keyboard).

jalopnik Deadspin Fusion Gizmodo Jalopnik Jezebel Kotaku Lifehacker The Root Video Jalopnik Reviews Foxtrot Alpha Black Flag Truck Yeah Lanesplitter The Garage Google Founder Disguised Himself During A Driverless Car Race To Hire A Dude Ryan FeltonYesterday 1:15pm Filed to: google driverless cars car technology 28 4 Edit Promote Share to Kinja Toggle Conversation tools Go to permalink Photo: Waymo This is neat. For several years, Google heavily invested in efforts to build driverless cars, with a separate subsidiary named Waymo now entirely focused on it. Turns out, Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin lured a high-profile autonomous car expert to the company at a driverless car race way back in 2005. The catch? He showed up in disguise. Advertisement According to CNBC, Page attended the driverless car race the 2005 DARPA Grand Challenge in disguise so he could check out the scene without being bothered. That’s how they came across Sebastian Thrun, the eventual leader of Google X (which created the program now known as Waymo). At the time, Thrun was building a driverless car to race in the DARPA challenge. Here’s more from the story: Advertisement “My team turned out to be the lucky winner for whatever reason,” Thrun told CNBC in an interview for the new series “The Brave Ones”. “And we got the attention of the Google founders. Yeah. So Larry came to the race itself and … came disguised with, like, a hat and sunglasses so he wouldn’t be bothered by everybody. But … he had a keen interest in this. Larry has been a believer in this technology for much longer than I even knew. And so was Sergey. And they really want to understand what’s going on.” Waymo’s self-driving efforts have been in the news lately thanks to a lawsuit the company filed against Uber, alleging the ride-hailing giant is using stolen autonomous tech designs to pursue its own driverless car ambitions. A judge could issue an order as early as this week on Waymo’s request to halt potentially all of Uber’s self-driving car program as the case proceeds. But back to Thrun. In 2007, CNBC says he approached Google about helping the company build its now well known Street View. Google took him up on the idea, and “...we built up Street View and with a singular vision to photograph every street in the world,” Thrun told the news outlet. Sponsored And it all started with a wealthy tech guy dressing in a disguise. That’s definitely an interesting way to woo a prospective employee.

However, now the OS – known as Fuchsia – has acquired a UI. What’s interesting here is that Google has dumped the Linux kernel that Android and Chrome OS is built on, substituting it with its own kernel, called Magenta, instead. The new UI, which Ars Technica has posted images of, is called Armadillo, and it’s built in Google’s Flutter mobile app SDK, which is used to create apps for both iOS and Android from a single codebase. As The Verge points out, that means if you’re geekily inclined, you can compile Armadillo and run it on an Android device yourself. If you do, we’d love to hear what you make of it. Microsoft patches ‘crazy bad’ vulnerability Microsoft has pushed out a patch for the rel=”nofollow””crazy bad” vulnerability identified earlier this week by researchers at Google’s Project Zero in record time, fixing a “wormable” vulnerability in Windows’ Malware Protection Engine. The researcher who identified the flaw, Tavis Ormandy, praised Microsoft’s “amazing response” on Twitter. Microsoft usually patches vulnerabilities once a month and rarely breaks that cycle, so the speed of the turnaround is particularly notable. Sophos Home Free home computer security software for all the family Learn More It seems that the problem was in Microsoft’s antimalware protection engine, which could have been tricked into running code delivered as a payload in an email, on a web page or via an instant message. Microsoft said that the patch is available now via Windows update. Austria orders Facebook to delete post Austria has become the latest European country to crack down on Facebook, with a court in Vienna ruling that it must take down posts that defamed the leader of the country’s Green party, Eva Glawischnig. What’s significant here is that the court has ruled that the posts must be completely erased rather than just being blocked in Austria. The court said that it was “easy” for Facebook to automate that process, although it noted that Facebook couldn’t be expected to try and find similar postings elsewhere on the platform. However, any verbatim repostings must be deleted, added the court. Facebook hasn’t commented on the ruling, but it comes as Germany has threatened to fine the company €500,000 per fake news post, and as the UK government has called on Facebook and other social media providers to “do more” to combat terrorism.

Unless the plant was named after Fusch. Reply Kate Bevan says: May 10, 2017 at 11:30 am Oh blimey, you’re absolutely right. Thanks, fixed … and always pleased to have a reason to use a picture of an armadillo. Reply Paul Ducklin says: May 11, 2017 at 5:36 pm English people make this mistake a lot – I think it’s because they are taught at school to pronounce it “fyoosha”, presuambly because “fook-seeya” would cause the class to dissolve into sniggers. Reply Scott says: May 10, 2017 at 6:46 pm Microsoft should not be overly credited for their quick turnaround time. Although I applaud the short turn around time period itself, Microsoft integrates engines updates into their definition updates. The big plus for Microsoft is that they could release an antimalware engine update and instead of going through the normal “Microsoft Updates” process, the engine was updated with the normal antimalware definitions. I applaud the turn around time; however, what I am saying is that Microsoft should not been given too much credit, since their update procedure was a simple fix on their end and an even easier installation for the users.

At a smidge under £650 (at Argos ), it's not far off the S8's £689, but it does work hard to earn the price. LG has made a sleek-looking reinforced glass and metal phone that's also water-resistant (including sea water), up to a depth of 1m for up to 30 minutes. Both the USB-C charging port and headphone jack are also waterproof, so no need for protective covers at the beach, pool or elsewhere. Front view of the new LG G6 (Photo: Suchandrika Chakrabarti) The phone is a comfortable fit in one hand, with an easily-navigated keyboard. It runs Android Nougat 7.0, with a Snapdragon 821 processor. The G6 also has 32GB storage (only half the S8's 64GB). The G6 also includes Google Assistant, making it the first third-party phone to have Google’s fast-improving AI voice-controlled personal assistant installed. The home button and two camera lenses on the back of the phone (Photo: Suchandrika Chakrabarti) Volume controls on the left (Photo: Suchandrika Chakrabarti) Read More Pixel and Pixel XL hands-on review: First impressions of Google's new smartphones The icons on the homescreen have a gently retro feel, with sweet pastel colours and rounded corners. The movement between folders, screens and apps feels smooth and scrolls without jumping, and the split-screen view is particularly impressive, allowing you to use two apps side-by-side. The updated software resizes the apps to fit nicely on the larger screen, minimising white space and maximising pictures. A closer look at icons on the LG G6's homescreen (Photo: Suchandrika Chakrabarti) Read More There's an iPhone case that also works as a coffee dispenser Unlike most similar smartphones with a 16:9 aspect ratio, the latest LG screen is 18:9, giving you just that bit more space to scroll, read and view. The home button has disappeared from the front of the phone, replaced by a fingerprint sensor on the back, just below the camera lenses (which both boast 13 megapixel sensors - better than the iPhone 7's 12MP). This is a much more convenient place for the button, where your finger naturally rests - as opposed to the S8 having the sensor by the camera lens. Camera Here's the view from Greenwich Observatory in normal camera mode (Photo: Suchandrika Chakrabarti) And here's the wide-angle shot, taken from exactly the same spot as the photo above (Photo: Suchandrika Chakrabarti) Read More Where to buy the LG G6 as it goes on sale across the UK LG has a fantastic dual camera lens, making wide-angle shots easy and helping you take photos that are a cut above the S8, iPhone 7 and other competitors. You can seriously up your selfie game, with options to smooth out your skin or adjust the photo's brightness for the most flattering effect. There's also the option to preview the last pic alongside the shot you're lining up (as the screen is handily the size of two Instagram squares) and film slow-motion or timelapse videos by simply choosing a different mode.

Just look at the detail on those cookies! Your Instagram followers won't know what's hit them. Instagram If you're keen on taking 360-degree photos, then there's a mode for that too. It's a must for keen travellers, and simple to do in 360 panorama mode (there's also a standard panorama mode). The clickable pics upload straight to Facebook for your friends and family to explore. Read More What the Nokia 3310 hype says about the sorry state of the mobile phone industry Battery The 3300mAh battery (500mAh larger than the G5) can just about get you through a full day's use. It comes with a fast charger in the box, getting you from zero to full in around an hour. In terms of energy-saving options, the sliding scale to dim the screen gets far too dark far too quickly - so that isn't really much of an option at all. You'll never be stuck for the time, date or battery level (Photo: Suchandrika Chakrabarti) Read More LG G6 flagship smartphone teased for launch at Mobile World Congress 2017 The built-in photo and video editing does eat away at the battery, and switching off the notifications isn't straightforward. Even when off, the screen displays the time, date and battery level in grey, which can't help. Unusually for LG, this model doesn't have a removable battery, and wireless charging isn't available outside the US. Audio Will the UK ever get the G6 with improved audio? (Photo: Suchandrika Chakrabarti) Read More LG G5 hands-on review from Mobile World Congress in Barcelona Luckily, the G6 keeps the G5's 3.5mm earphone jack. Otherwise, the sound isn't an improvement on the G5. When LG debuted the G6 at the Mobile World Congress in February, the audio announcement both excited and disappointed. The phone’s audio-enhancing Quad DAC was announced as exclusive to the company’s native South Korean market. It will be included on phones in other markets, starting with Australia, but there's no word yet on when - or if - the improved G6 will be available in the UK. For the moment, the British version of this phone has only a single speaker, and can sound a little tinny. Verdict Selfies and grids and sepia, oh my... (Photo: Suchandrika Chakrabarti) Read More Snapchat takes on Instagram's Boomerang with 'looping videos' and launches 'limitless snaps' LG has clearly put work into the look of the phone, the camera and the screen display. However, they have gone with an older processor in their shiny new phone, and the audio upgrades might never be available in the UK. Also, the G6 only offer half the storage of the Samsung S8 (32 vs 64GB), and for only £39 less. If you're a keen Instagrammer who's well overdue an upgrade, this is a great phone for you.

Name: Subject: Message: How to build your own digital assistant with a Raspberry Pi Featuresby Gary Sims13 hours ago 4 187 15 As voice recognition and natural language parsing have improved so has the availability of digital personal assistants, from Bixby to Alexa or Cortana to Google Assistant, all the major tech companies are continuing to develop digital assistants. Recently Google released its Assistant API for the Raspberry Pi. This means that makers, hobbyists and educationalists can now build the Google Assistant into project using the Pi. See also: Bixby vs Google Assistant vs Siri 2 weeks ago Following the API release I started looking into building a kind of Amazon Echo or Google Home clone using the Raspberry Pi. Fortunately for me after a few days of pondering Google and the Raspberry Pi Foundation released the “Voice Kit” with a special bit of hardware called the Voice HAT (basically a speaker driver and microphone), plus some great software to built exactly that, a Google Home clone. However, getting hold of the Voice Kit has been impossible. It was supplied on the cover of MagPi, the official Raspberry Pi magazine, and was sold out in hours. I hunted online and even asked one of my Android Authority colleagues (thanks Rob) to go out onto the streets of London to find a copy, but to no avail. Thankfully all of the instructions for assembling the Voice Kit are online along with the software. So I decided to see how difficult it would be to get the Voice Kit up and running without the Voice HAT. The good news is that is isn’t that hard! What you need To build your own digital assistant you will need: A Raspberry Pi 3 (along with all the normal bits and pieces like a microSD card, a mouse, keyboard etc) A speaker with a 3.5 mm connector A USB microphone A simple switch and cables that can be connected to the GPIO pins of the Raspberry Pi The basics In a nutshell what we are going to do is take the Voice Kit software and modify it to work with the Pi’s internal sound card and a USB microphone. We are then going to make a switch (for activating the voice input) and put it all together in a cardboard box! The first thing to do is download the Voice Kit microSD card image for the Raspberry Pi. You can download it directly from Google’s AIY Project site. Once the .img.xz file has been downloaded you need to write it to the microSD card using a card writing utility. The Etcher.io tool is a good choice for this as it is available for Windows, macOS and Linux. You don’t need to uncompress the image file, Etcher will take care of that for you. See also: Raspberry Pi 3 review March 16, 2016 When the microSD card is ready then you need to connect your Raspberry Pi 3 to a TV/monitor and hook up a mouse and keyboard. Once set up then boot your Raspberry Pi with the Voice Kit microSD card. After booting you will see the standard Pixel desktop, however the background has been changed to feature the  AIY Projects logo. There are a number of tasks that need doing and then you need to reboot. Click on the Raspberry symbol at the top left of the display. Move to Preferences and then click on Raspberry Pi Configuration. In the program go to “Interfaces” and enable SSH. Press OK. Click on the Wi-Fi symbol at the top right of the display (near the clock) and then click on your Wi-Fi network. Enter the passphrase as appropriate. If you want to set a fixed IP address then right-click on the same Wi-Fi symbol and click on Wireless & Wired Network Settings. In the program pick your network card (wlan0 for the wireless interface) from the drop down menu and then fill in the desired IP address and router etc. Double click on the “Start dev terminal” icon on the desktop. In the terminal window type sudo leafpad /boot/config.txt and remove the # in front the the line dtparam=audio=on and insert a # in front of the two lines below it. Save the file and exit from leafpad. From step 3 above the last few lines of /boot/config.txt should look like this: # Enable audio (loads snd_bcm2835)
dtparam=audio=on
#dtoverlay=i2s-mmap
#dtoverlay=googlevoicehat-soundcard Audio The next step is to get the audio working. You are going to need a speaker with a 3.5 mm connector and a USB microphone. I didn’t have a dedicated USB microphone at hand so I plugged in a spare webcam that I had and the Pi was able to use the microphone from the webcam as a standalone mic! If you need a USB microphone then try this one. Plug in the speaker into the 3.5 mm jack on the board and connect the USB microphone to one of the USB ports. In the terminal type: sudo leafpad /etc/asound.conf Delete all the contents of the file and replace it with: pcm.!default {
  type asym
  capture.pcm "mic"
  playback.pcm "speaker"
}
pcm.mic {
  type plug
  slave {
    pcm "hw:1,0"
  }
}
pcm.speaker {
  type plug
  slave {
    pcm "hw:0,0"
  }
} Save the file and exit from leafpad. The asounf.conf file tells the Pi about it sound hardware. As you can see there is a section for “mic” and another for “speaker”. The default values should be OK (but see below for troubleshooting). Now it is time to reboot. Click on the Raspberry symbol (top left) and click on Shutdown… followed by Reboot. When your Pi has rebooted it is time to run Google’s test scripts to make sure that everything is working. Double click on the “Start dev terminal” icon again and type: leafpad /home/pi/voice-recognizer-raspi/checkpoints/check_audio.py Near the top of the file change the line VOICEHAT_ID = ‘googlevoicehat’ to VOICEHAT_ID = ‘bcm2835’ and save and exit. On the desktop there are three files for checking your configuration, double click on “Check audio” and follow the on screen prompts. If you can hear the sound being played and you are able to record your voice then you have the audio working. If it doesn’t work then double check all the settings and read the Configure and Test the Audio page from Google’s Assistant documentation for more help and tips. In particular check out the section on using the “aplay -l” and “arecord -l” commands to check that your audio hardware is visible to the Pi. The cloud In order for the Google Assistant to work your Pi needs to be configured to work with Google’s cloud services. Full details of how you do this can be found on the Voice Kit website, but here is a quick summary: On the Raspberry Pi open up an internet browser and go to the Cloud Console. Create a new project In the Cloud Console, enable the “Google Assistant API”. In the Cloud Console, create an OAuth 2.0 client by going to API Manager > Credentials Click Create credentials and select OAuth client ID. Note that if this is your first time creating a client ID, you’ll need to configure your consent screen by clicking Configure consent screen. You’ll need to name your app (this name will appear in the authorization step). In the Credentials list, find your new credentials and click the download icon on the right. Find the JSON file you just downloaded (client_secrets_XXXX.json) and rename it to assistant.json. Then move it to /home/pi/assistant.json In the dev terminal type: systemctl stop voice-recognizer Go to the Activity Controls panel and switch on the following: Web and app activity, Location history, Device information, Voice and audio activity The switch If you have the full Voice Kit from Google/MagPi then it comes with a big arcade switch that is used to activate the voice recognition. Since I don’t have the Voice Kit I decided to use my own switch. For simplicity I am using a breadboard and a simple push button switch: The circuit for the switch is as follows: Once you have your circuit built you need to connect one side of the switch to GPIO 23 and the other side to ground, which is conveniently located on the next pin to the left of GPIO 23. If you can’t build the switch then even just briefly shorting GPIO 23 and ground will have the same effect! Test it You should now have everything you need to test Google Assistant on your Raspberry Pi. All you need to do is run the following command from the dev terminal: src/main.py Note: The first time you run main.py a web browser will open and you will need to login to Google to give permission for the Raspberry Pi to access the Google Assistant API. Press the button (and let go, there is no need to hold it) and say something to Google. Try: Who is the queen of England? What year was Henry the 8th born? When did the Mayflower leave Plymouth? Making a case The case that comes with the Voice Kit is simple in that it is made of cardboard, but yet sophisticated in that it has been designed specifically for the pieces supplied in the kit (like the speaker and the arcade button) and has an internal support structure. For your home brew Google Assistant you will just need to use your imagination. Here is my best effort, but please remember that I was trained as a software engineer, not a hardware guy! Wrap-up Once you have the basic Raspberry Pi based Google Assistant running then the next step is to customize it yourself. Google has lots of documentation about how you can extend the assistant using Google’s cloud services. There is even an example where you can you turn on and off an LED using your own custom voice commands. If you build anything cool with Google Assistant and the Raspberry Pi please let us know in the comments below. I am also keen to see the cases you make for your contraptions!

View Profile Image: Tory Rust/StyleCaster Print The secret to bouncy, messy, voluminous hair fit for a photo shoot Share Tweet Pin Share Tumble Combined comments & shares on social media If you Google “sexy hair” right now, you’ll find about 26 million articles and images of women with tousled, messy, curly and straight hair, because attractiveness is so damn subjective and also because Google is weird. But the one thing all of these hairstyles do have in common is volume — lots and lots of soft, bouncy, gravity-defying volume, which as anyone who has ever tried to create by themselves knows is an incredibly difficult look to get at home. More: Lucy Hale Gets Cystic Acne, & This Is How She Treats It Hey, we’re big fans of sleek, flat-ironed hair too, but sometimes, we want to play around with having Victoria’s Secret-level hair. You know, the kind that looks like it’s being perpetually blown by a soft breeze from the shores of Ibiza? So we asked hairstylist and all-around wizard Jasmine Santiago to show us exactly how to create bouncy, messy, voluminous hair fit for a photo shoot sans a ton of tools (or skills). Click through our GIF-filled tutorial ahead to find out exactly how to get the look at home, and try not to freak out too much when you realize it’s only four steps long. Photographer: Tory Rust Model:  Olga with MSA Models Makeup: Ashleigh Ciucci Hair: Jasmine Santiago More: The 5 Coolest, Under-$20 Makeup Brush Sets to Instagram Right Now Image: Tory Rust Step 1: Roll it out Surprise! Hot rollers weren't just for your mom in the '80s — they're also truly one the of best ways to get bouncy, Victoria's Secret-level volume that seriously lasts. To start, brush through your hair (if you have curls, blow them out or lightly straighten them first), then section off a 3-inch chunk of hair at your roots. Lift the hair up and pull it forward at an angle, then place a heated roller underneath the ends and roll it down, securing the roller against your scalp with the included clip. Repeat with the front sections of hair on either side of your part, then continue with the rest of your hair. Products to try: T3 Volumizing Hot Rollers Luxe (T3, $119) Conair Jumbo Roller Instant Roller Heat Setter (Ulta, $34) Remington H9096 Silk Ceramic Heated Clip Setter (Walmart, $34) Image: Tory Rust Step 2: Wait Taking your rollers out too soon is the enemy of volume and happiness. Seriously — wait until your rollers (not just your hair, but the actual rollers) are totally, 100 percent cold before unrolling them. Image: Tory Rust Step 3: Unravel Now for the fun part: the big reveal. Starting with the last roller you rolled, remove the clip and gently unravel the hair. Continue unclipping and unrolling, letting your curls hang loose and untouched. Image: Tory Rust Step 4: Add some texture To keep your volume from deflating by the end of the hour, you'll need to add some grip and texture to your (now) ridiculously soft hair. Blast your hair from root to tip with a veil of texturizing spray, then gently brush through your curls with a paddle brush, like the EcoTools Smoothing Detangler Brush, until your hair is soft and bouncy. Products to try: Living Proof Full Dry Volume Blast (Living Proof, $29) Garnier Fructis Dry Touch Texture Tease Spray (Garnier Fructis, $4.29) Not Your Mother's Double Take Dry Finish Texture Spray (Target, $6) Image: Tory Rust Step 5: Become a model Flip your part around, spray your roots with more texturizing spray and keep the volume going long enough to land a gig with Victoria's Secret. Or just show off your insanely volumized hair on social media like a normal person. Originally posted on StyleCaster.

[Minority Report] Google and Coca-Cola may target personalized ads at you - in real life Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/05/10 11:27am PDTMay 10, 2017 23 Plus 1 on G+ 45 Share on Facebook 49 Share on Twitter Total Shares117 News Videos Google and Coca-Cola's partnership effort for in-store advertising displays looks to be bearing fruit. The advertising system uses DoubleClick's preference and tracking data combined with Google's Beacon Platform to serve up targeted ads by pulling data from passing smartphones. With that info, displays are able to select content based on your preferences in the form of advertisements specifically targeted to passersby. In a recent grocery store pilot program the Minority Report-style ads performed quite very well. This isn't actually that new. It was discussed at a few places in the last couple months since the details were revealed at Google's conference. But, it seems to have quite effectively flown under the radar for that time, considering how cool it is. Coca-Cola made a detailed post about it on one of their social promotion sites in April as well, in which they talked about the potential environments for these tracking signage systems, like movie theaters and other Retail venues than just grocery stores. Google's partnership with Coca-Cola for this system has been discussed off-and-on for a few years. Back at the National Automatic Merchandising Association's OneShow in 2016 Google talked about the potential as applied to vending machines, and said that Google and Coca-Cola were working together on Bluetooth beacons for vending, but this is the first time I've actually gotten to see what it looks like and how it performs. Coca-Cola's Greg Chambers, at Google's recent Cloud Next Conference, said that it has been experimenting with small tests into proximity marketing since at least 2015 when they first started working with Google on a prototype. The two companies tested things with a pilot for the system in 250 Albertson's grocery stores, in which Coca-Cola saw some incredible results. There was a one year ROI on Coca-Cola products displayed by the system, and a spillover effect from so-called "category-lift," in the form of a total one-month ROI for all nearby soda products — i.e., this system sells a lot of soda for Coca-Cola and all other brands near it. There's no word yet on when or how Coca-Cola might roll this out to other stores, but given how positive the results were for the pilot tests, it is likely you'll see one someday at the end of the soda aisle in your local grocery. On a more technical note, I'm not sure exactly what sort of data is being sent to the displays by nearby phones or how it is taken. Allegedly the system uses Google's Eddystone beacons, which exchange information with nearby phones using Bluetooth low energy. This is the first time I've heard of Google's Beacon Platform actually being used, combined with DoubleClick's targeting advertising systems, to target people in the physical world. The privacy-conscious might express some concern at the potential of having your phone communicate your preferences to an in-store display, but I would hope and assume that any identifying information is stripped out. Either way, we're one step closer to this. Source: Digital Strategy Consulting Tags beacon platform beacons bluetooth low energy Coca-Cola Eddystone Targeted advertisements video subscribe ...

Anu6is Stop being absurd, how else would you know what you NEED? WesleySmalls Actually, you do. People require social interaction, it's a very strong part of our being. Humans generally don't like to be alone, and very much can't over longer periods of time. Because of this, people tend to follow each other's example in one way or another, advertising is just one of the many examples Ben Yeah, your phone communicating with a vending machine to give you personalised advertisements is not in any way 'social interaction'. WesleySmalls I did not say anything about that, it wasn't even remotely close, nor was the post I commented on. But of course, else you had to actually comment on my actual post, and realize that it's true that people follow other people Prezes Dyrektor But you are making it sound like advertising is indispensable in our lives. Well guess what, ads is the reason why I cut cable tv, they don't have those fancy adblockers. Ads is the reason I mostly listen to local academic radio without any. Etc. Ads and marketing are evil, and we are being manipulated every day. Now excuse me as I run to grab some sugar soda and candy. xyz Your second sentence was "People require social interaction". It seems you didn't bother reading your own comment. WesleySmalls Indeed, that was a art of my comment, which was a reply to a comment that wasnt about any digital technologies. Ryne Hager https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKlSVNxLB-A xyz "Humans generally don't like to be alone, and very much can't over longer periods of time." Right, that's why we have these things called friends and family. I mean if ads are your way making the loneliness go away, good for you. WesleySmalls It wasnt really difficult to grasp that advertisement uses these relationships and human behavior to advertise their product Avishek GSkynet: Resistance is Futile https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/eceea630e7e43621ded725c3914bdc7a06d9b153943c3512fb6b0f0eeff75d71.png Bryan Does it just give a different Coke commercial based on my tastes?

Ryne Hager I actually haven't seen one in my area yet, when I go out west in a month I'll see if I can drop by an Albertson's. Carlos Rodríguez So, you have sex toys in your cart, right? Ryne Hager Obviously not enough sex toys, if you're questioning that. Carlos Rodríguez “( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)” yochanan Albertson's are now all Safeway's, FYI. Ryne Hager Albertson's acquired Safeway back in 2015, indeed. yochanan Right, but it wasn't until fairly recently (at least in Northern CO) that Albertsons stores have been converted into Safeway's. Francesco Lorenzet i suppose they will have a whitelist Bane✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Well, I'm a blank slate to advertising. I might as well be a ghost. I block all ads, turn off all targeted options everywhere, and never click on any. I guess I'll have to turn off Bluetooth when I'm in stores now too. Fadakar lol if you think your record is clean you need to re-evaluate how seriously you want to take privacy. James F This. People underestimate how much of a digital footprint they leave, even if they do turn off everything. EowynCarter True. And if they are, they wouldn't show me ads for coca cola, I just don't like that. And sodas in general. Cakefish Agreed, if I have to endure advertising it might as well be about products that actually interest me. Bewear I am a fan of your picture edits, Ryne. Ryne Hager What a coincidence, I am also a fan of your work. I kept a Bewear in my party for most of Moon. Anu6is lol! Lord Argyris My party was boring. Two of them were from Gen I, and apart from my starter, only one other member was from Gen VII. Now really, Nintendo should get in on this whole Coke-Google partnership thing. Maybe put something in their 3DS games that ties into this advertising platform. "Oh, so you're raising a bunch of Fire-type Pokemon. I'll bet you're feeling pretty hot right about now. Know what would cool you right down? A nice, ice cold COKE." Ryne Hager I mean, with the launch event Munchlax and Munchlax/Snorlax available on the first island, who in their right mind didn't take a Gen I Snorlax to end game. Michael Oghia I came here just to give you a +1 for Hypno Toad. Steve Actually noticed this happening to me recently when near the vending machine at my job. Guessing the capabilities will be endless and more diverse when full-on set-ups are placed everywhere. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/7ea9fde9939850ddee856f08d34c3e8a98a6c90461c779f049060ec4e655b8c6.png https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/f87dc3afe5a1492c33e179552b9fcf3259d388ef4a1a6cfed7951d9612faeae6.png https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/da689e538e0681368f0ef1dac408a796aa111781564a9ded426c4639fbeab351.jpg F4LL0U7 Disabling Nearby will disable invasive ads, you say? Done! Morten Ulv Google usually have a way to opt out. james fuston https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPGgTy5YJ-g Ben Nothing better than a new way to sell people tooth-rotting, diabetes-causing sugar water. Nicholas Conrad *This* is the gateway to AR! Aing actual R; genius! abqnm Are these connected to the "Nearby" activity in Google Settings? (Which also interestingly enough at some point has earned the ability to add the Nearby activity directly to the homescreen. Don't know when it appeared as I don't open that screen often, but it's now an option in the overflow menu.) James F Beacons typically use Bluetooth. abqnm Yes, and Google's Nearby uses Bluetooth LE scanning and Play Services location. But with Google being a part of it, I'm asking if it is directly related to the Nearby function. I am not asking for how beacons typically work. MJ Double checked BT is off on my phone... The only time ever use it is when play music on a BT speaker which I don't do when grocery shopping. "With that info, displays are able to select content based on your preferences in the form of advertisements specifically targeted to passersby" How does these ads work exactly? I am not watching a 54min video. Dedren You don't need bluetooth on per say. It just uses that tech. I believe you will have to enable Nearby places, which is disabled by default but will probably be enabled by default in the future. MJ Nearby places will not be going on... F4LL0U7 I'm not sure they could develop an ad that's targeted enough to get me to buy Coke. F4LL0U7 I guess I might consider it if the vending machine held a family member hostage or something. James F I don't know if I should be concerned that you said *might* consider it.... F4LL0U7 What can I say, I'm just not very receptive to ads. Dedren What about Water, Sprite, SimplyOrange, Powerade, Minute Maid? Surely one of those you drink...all Coke. F4LL0U7 I mean, of course I drink water, but I get it from the filtered pitcher in my fridge. No to the others. xyz You regularly purchase water from the Coca-Cola company? May I also say, I've never heard of SimplyOrange and Powerade. I had no idea that diabetes and obesity came in so many flavors. Adrian quickest way to turn me off on a product. Bluetooth is only on in my car anyway so good luck with it. As soon as someone figures out how to spoof it and annoy people in public, it will go away. Max Johnson I thought it's been NFC and GPS all this time. At least from my Android Pay app. Adrian I don't leave either on when I'm not using them so it's probably a non-issue for me then. blindexecutioner I would literally break my phone if I got an ad as I walked by a pop machine (or whatever) if I couldn't opt out of it of course.. I would switch to iOS that day. If it happened on iOS I would stop using smart phones altogether. tehboogieman You could just turn off bluetooth. Or you know, there's your way rndusrnm479461 iOS also supports this same thing. rndusrnm479461 I've read the whole article and even watched some of that video and I still don't get it - what do your "preferences" affect in the ads? How will it affect what the ad displays? Does it just play the ad you're more likely to prefer from 5 different ads? I'm confused... Why is such system necessary for something simple like coke? Would make more sense for a bus stop ad or other kinds of billboards. Joey1058 I hate to tell you folks this, but I've been out in the wilderness preaching this for at least a good 10 years, if you go by my 2007 blog post: http://joey1058.blogspot.com/2007/07/robots-dreams-is-vending-machine-robot.html Cakefish ALL GLORY TO THE HYPNOTOAD!!! xyz Damn, you got me. I have no choice now but to buy a Pepsi. psuedonymous "On a more technical note, I'm not sure exactly what sort of data is being sent to the displays by nearby phones or how it is taken." BLE Beacons are transmit-only. In order for a piece of ad signage to get any information from you, the chain works like this: BLE beacon emits location. Phone detects beacon, is informed that it is near location. Software on phone then queries backend platform (Google's Beacon platform in this case) to see if there is anything it needs to do with this new knowledge. This could be displaying a popup message, or in this case the phone itself does nothing. Instead, since Google's service has learnt your phone is near a beacon (geographically it cares not, this is logical nearness rather than necessarily physical nearness) so contacts the beacon owner with "Anonuser is nearby who hits your preset filter for Target users" (e.g. users who like coke, users who are above a certain age, users who have not previously pinged this beacon, etc). 'Anonuser' could be a unique but nonpersonal hash, a semi-persistant hash (e.g. for each ad client only), a time-limited persistant hash (e.g. valid for only a certain period before changing, probably just for the single proximity session), or just no hash at all so the ad client cannot track individual users. There may be an avenue for the ad client to pass a message back to google who can then pass it onto the user, without the ad client knowing who the user is.

Owlchemy Labs, makers of Job Simulator and Rick and Morty: Virtual Rick-ality, joins Google Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/05/10 5:18pm PDTMay 10, 2017 15 Plus 1 on G+ 16 Share on Facebook 34 Share on Twitter Total Shares65 Games Google News Videos Google and Owlchemy Labs are ready to get schwifty together, as the one has now eaten the other like so many Pac-Man dots on the field of VR games. Both companies made their coordinated announcements earlier today. Google has been expanding their VR efforts pretty aggressively recently, so it's not too surprising. Although Owlchemy has produced Android games in the past, as of yet none of their VR works have been for the platform. There is no doubt that in the nascent market of virtual reality games, Owlchemy is one of the better names to have risen. They're quick and prolific, having produced Job Simulator as a launch title for the Oculus and HTC Vive, as well as following the success up quickly with Rick and Morty: virtual Rick-ality. The studio claims, following a test of the DK1, they vowed never to look back to boring flat-screen games again, and their efforts in the genre have resulted in immediate recognition and praise. Alas, that the above Rick and Morty game is not for Android. Owlchemy Labs' products are among the best (and funniest) out there, so I don't think it's any surprise Google would have expressed an interest if they wanted to buy a VR content producer. The folks over at Owlchemy are very excited about the deal. I hope that the extra resources from being a part of the great Googopoly result in more good VR times for us as consumers. Let's hope we can see some of their games ported over to Daydream. Wubba lubba dub dub.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Mobile Image Source: Marques Brownlee, YouTube Google’s mysterious new Fuchsia mobile OS shown off on a smartphone for the first time Zach Epstein @zacharye May 11th, 2017 at 11:50 AM Share Tweet Google’s Android platform is the most widely used mobile operating system in the world. In fact, it’s so popular right now that it’s beyond difficult to imagine a future without Android. Of course, people at one point felt the same way about early smartphone platforms like Symbian and BlackBerry OS, which have been almost completely wiped from the face of the Earth at this point. Some day, iOS and Android will be distant memories as well. If there’s one thing companies like Nokia and BlackBerry taught us, it’s that companies at the top can only stay at the top if they’re constantly preparing for the future. So, rather than rest on its laurels and sit pretty while Android continues to dominate the smartphone market, Google is already hard at work on a fresh new mobile platform called Fuchsia, which may some day completely replace Android. Don't Miss: Add a high-tech Head Up Display to any car for under $50 Earlier this week, the world got its first look at Google’s new Fuchsia operating system, a top to bottom reimagining of the mobile experience. While apps are at the core of every current mobile platform, Fuchsia focuses on information, pulling details from all installed apps as well as Google’s various services and presenting it all in a scrolling card layout. Soon after screenshots hit the web, a video was created that showed the Fuchsia OS in action on a computer using developer tools. The new platform is still in the very early stages of development, but the video gave us a good idea of how Google’s vision might work. Now, however, Fuchsia has popped up on an actual smartphone for the first time. This gives us an even better idea of what the platform might be like in real life usage. 9to5Google created the video, and you’ll find it embedded below. While Android is built on Linux, Fuchsia is a complete reimagining of mobile platforms built from the ground up using Google’s own Magenta kernel and Google’s own programming language. Google’s vision of life after Android is a stark departure from what we’ve seen from the company in the past, and Google seemingly wants to ensure that it can control every aspect of the platform from start to finish.

Chrome Dev has a new search widget you can try out Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/05/11 8:15am PDTMay 11, 2017 3 Plus 1 on G+ 34 Share on Facebook 40 Share on Twitter Total Shares77 Applications News Google apparently thinks you don't have enough ways to search Google on your phone. On my Pixel, I have the Google search 'pill' on the home screen, and Google Assistant if I hold down on the home button or use 'OK Google.' If you have Chrome Dev, you can use a new search widget as well. All joking aside, I can see this being useful for some people. Tapping on the widget instantly opens Chrome with the address bar highlighted, so while you can use it for basic searches, you can also use it to open websites without tapping on Chrome first. And since it uses Chrome's address bar search, it will use whatever search engine you have selected in Chrome. The widget was developed as part of an anti-trust lawsuit settlement in Russia, where Yandex claimed Google had violated local competition rules. The terms of the agreement required Google to offer a search widget that could change search engines, which will replace the standard Google search widget for Russian devices. You can try this for yourself by downloading Chrome Dev (or Canary), then dragging the new 4x1 widget to the home screen. I don't think I'll ever use it, but it's there if you want it.

Eric This search widget was created from the agreement reached in the recent Russian antitrust case Ben Thanks to Russian antitrust regulators, I can finally search with Bing from my homescreen! 😆😄 Source of that information or did you forget the /s ? Eric It's real. https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/17/google-reaches-7-8-million-settlement-in-its-android-antitrust-case-in-russia/ "In addition, the agreement states that Google will develop a new Chrome widget for Android devices already being used in Russia, which will replace the standard Google search widget on the home screen and allow users to see the new “choice screen” when it’s launched." Corbin Davenport Thanks for the link, I've added it to the post. Shining Wing Oh yeah, that makes sense. AP should probably revise the article to mention that it lets you use different search providers, since that's what it's really there for. King_Android Yessss, been waiting on this search feature.... F4LL0U7 This is amazing, I've been dreaming of a Google search bar on my home screen for years. Kawshik Ahmed This is created because Google promised Russian authorities that they will let 3rd party Search Engine on Android homescreen via Google Chrome Search Widget. Willie Chalmers III Really? That's interesting. Who is this info from? Kawshik Ahmed It was on news every where few weeks ago Kawshik Ahmed The reason Google created this widget because after they lost the Anti Trust case, Google made a deal with Russian Authorities that they will let 3rd party Search Engines in Android Home Screen via new Google Chrome Search Widget. They are just keeping their promise. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/4b6cf24bff8ed22d693ebe536bd4ff92a9efe7876c5a173f1541bb6c3c429287.png https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/8929a64a1e973914b0b4b23a5cfe5f75d8e3a5727f097d81c1bef38a947cd7f8.png https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/4e993db7f9fc815e53314498ef80bdd53359a121a49fd376618b387ba98e6892.png https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/6560cec28f50ccee765f2173480161b91001ac1f2e03ab20b744e959d85a693d.png https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/664448c4b0b1f60e724477c9d5c26687e22eca14d2fa5a4ed65db0372c1305b9.png 雷安德逻 Talking about Chrome, anyone noticied the new icon on Chrome Beta?

The Play Store adopts new app and notification icons with v7.8.16 [APK Download] Cody Toombs Follow View All Posts 2017/05/10 6:25pm PDTMay 10, 2017 110 Plus 1 on G+ 272 Share on Facebook 98 Share on Twitter Total Shares480 Applications Downloads News Google never stops changing things up. A new version of the Play Store app is rolling out to users and it comes with a new icons for the app launcher and notifications. They're simple cosmetic adjustments, but these are the types of things you can't help but notice as soon as they're on your screen. Left: Old version. Right: New version. The new app icon leaves behind the last remnants of the shopping bag icon that came along when Google still called this the Android Market. It is now just the Google Play logo with no other ornamentation. It's worth noting that the round icon variant hasn't changed, so it still looks like the Google Play logo on a dinner plate. Above: Old version. Below: New version. The notification icons have also gone through a little facelift. These also trade away the tote bag motif for the Google Play triangle, but slightly adjusted with the checkmark extending beyond the lines. The notification icons come in different colors for each of the content stores (e.g. apps, books, movies). The notification icon for stacked updates – when more than one app is installed or updated – is no longer a stack of blocks, it's just the same triangle app icon used with single installs. We're still looking for more changes in this update, but it's starting to look like this may be it. If you don't want to wait for Google to send this update out to you, grab it from the APK Mirror link below. Download The APK is signed by Google and upgrades your existing app. The cryptographic signature guarantees that the file is safe to install and was not tampered with in any way. Rather than wait for Google to push this download to your devices, which can take days, download and install it just like any other APK.

They 'quickly' portray even to a naive what kind of app you will be clicking on, especially amid numerous numbers of apps. Marcelove .Google' employee : "Let's change an icon the people are used to and know for many years to something that doesn't improve anything." Google's executives : "Genius!” . Powsniffer0110 4.0 FTW Burak Çalık they are not triangles, its the play icon. leganzish What shape is a play icon? I forget. Hachiko Google play books was perfect with Android 5 but only this one... Android 6 version is almost perfect TechGuy22 New icon every year. They are going to change play Store soon too lol Total Insecurity How do you know that? boop Unless you mean the name, the app just got another design update. sbeaulieu Isn't that the same icon from a couple of years ago? Tom Westrick We've always been at war with Eastasia Captain_Invisible Yeah.. they've used that icon on and off in promotion for a while. 4Ui812 Looks like I'll have to wait until it gets pushed. Apkmirrior won't let me download it (I don't turn off my ad blocker for anyone :-) Gjorgi Lazarovski You can download even with the adblocker on. You just need to wait like 10 sec for the download button to show up. sklatigre Can confirm Cakefish And you get to admire a cool cat. Richard Branches The play store icon on google chrome is still the old one, they should update it as well... https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/bca1aca3fd5b60e08fcd507e7c39b67f23f70ed0e4ff417bcf62881906f7106a.png Тарас Мукин Chrome apps were announced to be removed soon. Don't think they are going to bother. Richard Branches You're right about that, but they still will be available on Chrome OS so why not update it anyway?... Curt Because Google. Spazturtle Won't they be replaced in Chrome OS by Android app support? Richard Branches No, they won't... Tom Westrick If they wait long enough it'll just be back to that logo C64 Thank god / satan (choose your preference) for icon packs Konrad Krawczuk Icon packs are always kinda problem to me. If you have a few without icon from icon pack you must always fight with inconsistency. Powsniffer0110 Yes! I'm too freaking anal about this so I cannot use icon pack​s :( xyz Neither. C64 Sorry forgot the Atheist Jose Romero Google IO can't come sooner. Devin Studios Looks kinda boring compared to the old icon. Breathless So wait what happened to circles?... Cody Toombs Circles are there on the Pixel and in any other situation where the round icons are chosen. The triangle icon shows up on everything else. Anton Kuznetsov Triangles is the new circles burkett375 Since they love to A/B test, make 7 different message apps, etc....they should make 3 competing app stores/markets/hubs Ben Godfrey Don't give them any "good" ideas ;) Marcelove It doesn't matter... Google's employees are paid to keep an eye here at AP ... But it must be chimpanzees, because even with the clear feedback about stupid decisions they got here, they still don't give a f*ck and keep the screw route. Sumeet Deshmukh People who paid a lot of money to Google aren't getting these icon updates, the pixel guys mattcoz Because our icons already dropped the shopping bag, no need for an update. Sumeet Deshmukh I was a little sarcastical, I love my pixel (styled rom on my Nexus 5 (not x) Victor Stuber ya, but we got crappy white circles around all our icons. It sucks Leon I like my circles personally. sklatigre Gonna miss the shopping bag notification, kinda liked it. global etest You can keep it easily by icon packs.. sklatigre Didn't know icon packs can change the notification icons also. Margaritas Ante Porcos Google is a mess in everything. Mr. DICKHEAD it was always a mess.. Berkay Anyone else dislike both the circled icon and just the icon by itself? I prefer the shopping bag... It looks the best IMO. Thomas I loved the Android Market icon. Made so much sense SavageJeep What is Android Market? /s Salis Before Google Play branding, the app store used to he simply called Android Market. NooSH it looks like crap and i'm glad they are getting rid of it. Berkay So you prefer a simple triangle over a shopping bag? It looks horrible lol. TheDrunkenClam Completely agree. Google's whole ad campaign about Android was "be together, not the same". And then they make literally all of their icons the same by putting them in boring white circles. All in an effort to copy apple. I love the different sized and shaped icons of Android. Not a good look, Google. Jesse Kawell Once you see that notification icon "checkmark" ✅ as a 3D post lying down at an angle, you can never unsee it. BoFiS Aww, that's sad, and almost unrecognizable now since I still call mine "Market" on my homescreen... Branko Proof that Google lost the plot. reCoded So, the circle icon is the same I guess? Martin Let me read the article for you: "It's worth noting that the round icon variant hasn't changed, so it still looks like the Google Play logo on a dinner plate." Anton Kuznetsov This localization of 'update all' button text is awful https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/57e6791db8965bf1e13f4f50e3b6b5b303644e9c3f1660799bf9896ed1ef57b3.png Exalm ОМГ. Это именно в новой версии вот так? Captain_Invisible That's your crazy language's fault. Vitias R. No it's not. Have a nice day. thunderqus Only if I can find what you are talking about in English and posting screen in "who knows which" language. Vitias R. It says "Update your apps right today". I think that "Обновить все" is enough. Konrad Krawczuk Why it is not something like "обновить все" ? YuCMi Jesus christ Google. What sin did the previous icon commit? Was it too old for you guys? Grey Very ugly and hard to understand. Not intuitive at all. But I guess that's Google 2017! Lawstorant Looks generic af. Really Google? WTF? Maybe just go back to HOLO then? DragoCubed The new icon is nice but the icon in the notification bar isn't so nice. The one thing I don't like about losing the bag is the icon not representing a store. xyz OMG! TRIANGLE! NO CIRCLE? Like if you don't give a flying F about icon shapes. LOL I want circle, niggа! LOL New icon! Fuсk YEAH! Paul Teale Not circular then, not really following their own guidelines are they Kieron Quinn The round icon is round, the non-round icon is not. They're following their guidelines just fine Erimaru What about round icon? Curt I actually like this icon the most. Martin Spierings I already got complaints from people that didn't identify the play store or play icon with app store. So how the hell would this help people? They should realize that most people don't understand the connection google is looking for. Play is used for movies/film or games, not apps. The bag-background at least gave some indication on what to expect. The new one will get lots of people (those not really experienced with Android or mobile in general) to get their apps from there. These things should be self explanatory. And Google should drop the Play name (plus icon). Its a stupid name already. avnow well I used to get this icon pack, not exactly but close to this with an icon pack, this icon looks crisp! //moumon Meh.. I'm still using Elta icon pack :v That's one of the reason why I love android... Customize to meet your expectations <3 jcopernicus Awesome. A play button for purchases! Makes sense! Ra1nb0wD4sh DE Press Start to shut down Windows. :D (Not relevant anymore, I know) Ruben Tavano On the lateral menu the apps section was in the old green and with this update it has been updated to match the new green of the whole play store Alexander Reddicks The icon has been updated to support the new "adaptive" icon style being showcased next week. https://developer.android.com/preview/features/adaptive-icons.html Mr. DICKHEAD This is dumb theres nothing new I like the bodybag version.. but the naked one alone? seriously..?! David Onter The new icon looks HUGE next to the others. It doesn't seem to follow the spacing guidelines? Marcelove Google' employee : "Let's change an icon the people are used to and know for many years to something that doesn't improve anything." Google's executives : "Genius!” Biga173rd They can't make up their minds. madmaglio Finally. I've been replacing the bag icon with my own version of this for years. so much cleaner. VirtualWave I kinda hate it, it looks overly large and gaudy. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/d5821ea6199d4b4d1b5b7fa7fb41a252ab810c809090eb00f133b88f741b1735.png Follow Android Police 1.49M 468k 143k 115k Latest Deals 4 [Deal Alert] Get the LG Urbane 2nd Edition for $171.99 on eBay 2017/05/11 8:04pm PDTMay 11, 2017 4 [Deal Alert] Get 10,000 Amazon Appstore coins for $65 ($35 off) through May 25th 2017/05/11 1:34pm PDTMay 11, 2017 27 T-Mobile to offer 'buy one, get one' deal on Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus starting tomorrow (May 12th) 2017/05/11 12:52pm PDTMay 11, 2017 7 [Deal Alert] Huawei Watch in Jewel/Pearl $220 at Amazon ($330 off) 2017/05/10 7:32pm PDTMay 10, 2017 30 [Update: Deal ended] [Featured Deal Alert] Caseology is offering its new cases for the Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus to Android Police for as little as $5.99 for a limited time [Sponsored] 2017/05/10 2:39pm PDTMay 10, 2017 Latest Poll Do you use a screen protector on your phone?

Menu CLOSE News Videos Whitepapers eBooks Advertise Contact Us HOT TOPICS TechZone360     Conferencing Multi-Gigabit Ethernet Fraud & Identity Contact Center Solutions Communications Applications FEATURE NEWS Google's New Buy Boosts VR Gaming By Steve Anderson May 11, 2017 Google isn't exactly new to gaming. As the originator of the Android operating system, it's had a hand in more than a few games. A while back, Google even had some special games specifically for Chrome, like the Wizard of Oz-related Chrome Experiment. Now, thanks to a recent purchase, Google might be an even bigger part of the picture than ever before as it picked up Owlchemy Labs, a leader in virtual reality (VR) gaming. Gamers are likely familiar with Owlchemy Labs, even if not immediately; Owlchemy put together both Job Simulator and Rick and Morty: Virtual Rick-ality, two of the biggest VR games running right now. This acquisition won't affect any of Owlchemy's releases—reports suggest that there are several games currently in various stages of development at the company that will still come out—but rather, Owlchemy will enjoy support from Google. What's interesting here is that Google's purchase of Owlchemy is almost at odds with Google's own internal VR development. While Google, with its Daydream VR platform, has been focusing more on visuals and limited motion controls, Owlchemy has instead focused on its controls in a bid to approximate the experience of using real hands. It's worth noting that Google has released products that weren't for Google headsets, so this could just be a project in that vein. With its I/O developer conference set to arrive next week—and E3 only a little over a month out right now—there's every opportunity that Google could be planning something a lot bigger in the space to come. Given the advances made by competitor Facebook and its Oculus acquisition, that's not out of line; Google almost certainly won't want to cede non-mobile VR to PlayStation and Facebook. It would be easy here to say that Google is trying to expand beyond its own capabilities in the VR space, expressed primarily by the Daydream system. After all, if Google's focused on limited manipulation and all Owlchemy does is manipulation—seriously, have you seen either of its games? They're like an electronic busy box toy for grown men and women, only a lot funnier—then Google might be set to bring Owlchemy's development to its own operations. It's also something of a profit center; Job Simulator alone has sold over $3 million's worth so far. This could be the start of something impressive for Google, and since Owlchemy has already delivered in the past, it's a safe bet it will continue to do so. With some powerful new backing and loads of resources, the next stop for Owlchemy could be just about anywhere.

In a surprise announcement at the Build developer event today, Microsoft revealed it has been working with Apple to get iTunes listed in the Windows Store. It might not sound like an important addition, but iTunes is one of the most searched for apps that’s currently missing in the Windows Store. Microsoft will also need to attract apps like Adobe’s range of creative apps and Google’s Chrome browser. There are signs that Chrome may never appear on the Windows Store as Google will need to rework its browser to meet Microsoft’s strict app requirements. Windows Store apps that browse the web need to use Microsoft’s Edge engine, and the current Chrome desktop app uses Google’s Blink rendering engine. Google could decide to create a new version of Chrome specifically for the Windows Store as it has done before with iOS, but it’s unlikely. Either way, iTunes is a big addition for regular consumers and a slight boost to Microsoft’s Windows Store efforts. It will still take a lot more than iTunes arriving in the Store to determine the success of its desktop apps in the store, though.

Thanks to a new artificial intelligence tool from Google, you can now make customizable emoji stickers of yourself based on a selfie. The tool is part of Google's chat app Allo and is available for use starting Thursday, Fast Co Design reported. Exclusive: @Google’s new AI tool turns your selfies into emoji https://t.co/zYgoYQ9kWr pic.twitter.com/GUmQze9gnC — Co.Design (@FastCoDesign) May 11, 2017 "What we're doing with Allo is trying to find all the ways that ML can make messaging better," Jason Cornwell, Google's Communications UX Lead, told Cliff Kuang. "From saying the right thing at the right time to conveying the right emotion at the right time." The new tool started as a research project intended to determine if ML (machine learning) could be used to make an "instant cartoon" of a selfie. To push beyond the limitations of the cartoon format, Google brought in the expertise of art director Jennifer Daniel. Google Allo trumps SnapChat with new selfie feature. https://t.co/ef3sUuxpu2 pic.twitter.com/AV0zMwQyVv — Mark Stronge (@markoftec) May 11, 2017 Within the Allo app, users will now be able to choose the "Turn a selfie into stickers" option when responding to someone. Once this option is selected, users are asked to take a selfie that's immediately put through Google's "image-recognition algorithms." The user's facial features are then mapped to a kit from Cartoon Network artist Lamar Abrams. Users can then make alterations to the design before 22 custom stickers are produced. As you can imagine, the options here are abundant. According to Fast Co Design, Google estimates there are 563 quadrillion faces that could potentially be generated using the new Allo tool. 563 QUADRILLION FACES. But the goal here, Cornwell explained, isn't to produce the most accurate images of users. "It's to let someone create something that feels like themselves, to themselves," he said. Google launched Allo for Android and iOS in September 2016, touting it as a "smarter" messaging app. The app also utilizes the Google Assistant, which allows users to converse with Google by asking questions directly within the chat interface. Google considers the Assistant to be "the next chapter" in their journey to help people in their everyday lives.

Relja Marcovik, engineering director of virtual reality and augmented reality at Google, announced the news in a blog post Wednesday, saying Owlchemy “set a high bar for what engagement can be like in virtual worlds, and do it all with a great sense of humor!” Terms were not disclosed. In a separate blog post, Alex Schwartz, the Austin company’s CEO, said the Owlchemy operation will “continue building high quality [virtual reality] content for platforms like the HTC Vive, Oculus Touch, and PlayStation VR. This means continuing to focus on hand interactions and high quality user experiences, like with Job Simulator.” Owlchemy was founded in 2010 and, in 2016, raised $5 million in Series A funding from investors such as Qualcomm Ventures, The Venture Reality Fund, HTC, Colopl Next, and Capital Factory.

It’s called Windows 10 S, and it’s essentially a stripped-down, streamlined version of the company’s desktop OS. It seems like a solid idea, but if there’s one thing about the new Windows “lite” that is giving would-be buyers pause, it’s the fact that only apps from the Windows Store can be installed on any device using the new operating system, and that means no third party browsers, like Google Chrome. So why doesn’t Google just make a Windows Store version of Chrome and make everyone happy? Unfortunately it’s not nearly that easy. Don't Miss: This is how Samsung will stop the Galaxy Note7R from exploding. As ZDNet points out, Microsoft’s restrictions and requirements for apps submitted to the Windows Store would essentially force Google to totally rewrite a new browser from the ground up. The issue stems from Microsoft’s requirement that all Windows-approved apps utilize the company’s own rendering engines. Microsoft describes the policy, and its impact on third party browsers, thusly: Windows Store apps that browse the web must use HTML and JavaScript engines provided by the Windows Platform. All Windows Store content is certified by Microsoft to help ensure a quality experience and keep your devices safer. With this policy, instated early this year, the browser a customer chooses in the Store will ensure the protections and safeguards of our Windows platform. If people would like to access apps from other stores and services, they can switch to Windows 10 Pro at any time. In short, even if Google — or Opera or Mozilla — repackaged their browsers in a way that would allow them to be installed via the Windows Store, the actual architecture of the apps would lead Microsoft to reject them outright. In the big picture, it makes sense for Microsoft to lock down what apps are used on its education-focused Windows spin-off and, like Chrome OS, preventing third party browsers in the name of convenience and security is probably a smart play. All that being said, it certainly doesn’t make Microsoft Edge any more appealing.

Video Samsung Galaxy S8 vs LG G6 Camera Shootout Google has only been in the serious VR game for a few months with Daydream, but that doesn’t mean it’s a small player. Many of its interactive and immersive efforts extend beyond the limitations of its phone-based headset, including Title Brush and Google Earth VR, and a new acquisition looks to take VR to the next level. Relja Markovic, engineering director of VR and AR at Google, has announced that the company has acquired Owlchemy Labs, the studio responsible for award-winning titles such as Job Simulator and Rick and Morty: Virtual Rick-ality. However, Owlchemy says it is “free to pursue raw creation and sprint toward interesting problems,” despite its new owners. Of note, neither game is available on Daydream and requires an HTC Vive, Oculus Rift, or PlayStation VR to run. On its own blog, Owlchemy says it will “continue building high quality VR content for platforms like the HTC Vive, Oculus Touch, and PlayStation VR,” but makes no specific mention of Daydream. In a statement to The Verge, however, Markovic praised the Daydream headset, while adding “there will be many, many things that come after that.” Google has slowly been expanding the Daydream library since its release last year, but it’s still quite small. Most recently, Virtual Rabbids and Beartopia VR were announced, but neither has been released yet. Daydreaming about the future: With I/O just around the corner, there are certainly some interesting possibilities here. Daydream hasn’t exactly taken off like it seemed it would, but an Owlchemy-exclusive title would certainly boost interest, as would a more powerful device like the Rift or the Vive. Google I/O has been a launchpad for many of Google’s VR efforts, including Cardboard and Daydream, so it’s quite possible that we get a glimpse at the future of the platform.

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Google acquires Owlchemy Labs, one of VR gaming’s top studios By John Hoff - May 11, 2017 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter Google is really putting its foot down in making sure the company is ahead of the curve in the virtual reality (VR) market. This day, the mothership acquired Owlchemy Studios, a very succesful VR gaming outfit with very good cred in the industry. With the backing of the search giant, expect new games to come out of Owlchemy very soon. Owlchemy Studios are the minds behind “Job Simulator” and “Rick and Morty: Virtual Rick-ality”. Now that Google has taken them into the fold, Owlchemy is slated to keep releasing VR games for multiple platforms. “We have a slate of original games that we have in [the] production and prototyping phase, and we’re going to continue to do that,” says Owlchemy co-founder Alex Schwartz. One of Owlchemy’s trademarks is how great they integrate the use of hands in their games, as with Job Simulator. Schwartz says that full-motion hand tracking is “kind of our key factor.” It seems that Google will benefit from that, as this is in contrast to Google’s current VR platform, Daydream, which uses very limited motion controls. Google is fully committed to exploring the VR market, and this acquisition is just one step along the way. “We have a pretty big vision” for virtual and augmented reality, says Google VR and AR engineering director Relja Markovic. “Daydream’s a great product — I love my Daydream. But there will be many, many things that come after that.” VIA: Owlchemy Story Timeline Pixel XL owners receiving free Daydream View from Verizon Google Daydream does not work on the Galaxy S8 – yet 'Virtual Rabbids: The Big Plan' launched by Ubisoft for Daydream TAGS acquisition Android Google virtual reality John Hoff Must Read BlackBerry KEYone Review Samsung Galaxy S8 Review Huawei Watch 2 hands-on Community 922.5klikes 476.1kfollowers 85.8kcomments / Free WordPress Plugins and WordPress Themes by Silicon Themes.

That’s what makes it so fun, right? Analytics programs let you measure everything from who and where your website visitors come from to what content they are interested in. NB: This is a viewpoint from Vikram Singh, author of the Words of Vikram blog. These engagement and conversion metrics can help you understand what is really working when it comes to your website and marketing efforts. Some hotels have an in-house digital marketing team, but most outsource their online campaigns to an agency. Either way, these teams are usually tasked with producing an ROI (return on investment) report for every dollar spent on channels like Google AdWords, Facebook, etc. There is an industry-wide obsession with knowing where the last revenue-generating click came from. This metric invariably takes center stage in marketing meetings, ensuring that the conversation never moves beyond the last click and how much revenue was booked. Ignoring overall marketing channel performance might have worked for hotels in the good old days, but not today. A lot of hotels are struggling to understand why they are not seeing massive returns on their advertising dollars anymore. Even brand name traffic and clicks are in decline. So what has eroded your marketing campaign power? The villain in this story – the one preventing you from moving forward – is this thing called last click attribution. It has derailed countless hotel marketing campaigns for both large and small operators. I’d like to take some time to help you understand attribution models in the hospitality and travel business, and how they affect your marketing efforts. What is an attribution model? The good news is that most hotels and inns are spending some amount of money on digital ads. The bad news is that decision-makers have a limited understanding of how online marketing works today, and which strategies they should be crediting for the successes and failures of their campaigns. Let’s dive right into attribution – this is a set of rules that that help you determine which touchpoints along the conversion path should be getting the credit for the final sale or conversion. Sounds simple… but it’s not. What makes it tremendously complicated in our sector is the number of touchpoints involved when someone is planning a trip, and subsequently a hotel stay. A touchpoint is any point of contact that occurs between you and your customer; in our case, we are discussing online touchpoints. Here is a list of some of the touchpoints that might occur between your hotel and a potential guest who is planning a trip to Sydney over a period of weeks or months before visiting: Top-level destination research: airfare searches, Sydney travel blogs, etc. Neighborhood research: staying in Bondi Beach vs Central Business District vs iconic Sydney Harbor Hotel research: Narrowing lodging search by researching independent vs brands; top-ranking hotels for value and price on TripAdvisor; hotel websites, social media profiles, and blogs Things to do: online searches for top things to do in Sydney; lists and blogs about Sydney; seasonal events Dining: restaurants, dietary requirements and cuisine preferences, must-haves, food blogs, review websites While the above process is happening, your guest might also encounter some of these hotel-specific marketing touchpoints: Hotel display ads: placed on top travel blogs and websites Hotel location and value Google ads: “Luxury Hotels in Sydney,” “Hotels near Sydney Harbor” Hotel brand name Google ads: when they search for your hotel by name Hotel TripAdvisor Page: while they are still researching your price and value Meta/OTA rate shop: your listings, reviews, and rate profile Hotel blog post about seasonal events: useful content on your website Hotel email newsletter: perhaps they sign up to stay in touch before booking or arriving the hotel Hotel local dining guide; return visit for more useful content on your website Hotel Facebook ads: and other social media ads, while scoping out your social profiles Every single touchpoint is a crucial part of the shopper’s journey. This Expedia study showed that a typical hotel guest will visit over 38 websites before booking the room. A typical website reservation that you are seeing today is the result of 30+ touchpoints that occurred at different stages of travel planning before the final act of booking a room. All the online channels you use today are more connected than ever; they must work together to support your goal of getting a booking. If you are only looking at where the final click came from when attributing revenue, you are missing the big picture. The very last step in a long decision-making process has not single-handedly earned the booking. It doesn’t make sense to allocate your entire marketing budget based on the last click that occurred before the booking. So, let’s talk now about proper marketing channel attribution. Deciphering the attribution models in Google Google has been working on making attribution modeling more mainstream, in 2014, it released the Attribution Modeling Tool in Google AdWords. Google wants you to see how users interact with your ads, so you can run better campaigns. As of May 2016, you can integrate the attribution model of your choice with your conversion data and ad bids. Excellent tool for everyone involved! It’s especially helpful for the very few with “marketing” in their job title that actually log in and work on their marketing campaigns. Of course, if you are just waiting for agency reports to drop into your inbox, you cannot witness this beauty firsthand…but at least you can make changes to the way you measure success. Once you have decided to actively assign attribution for your paid and earned marketing efforts, you have to determine which model works best for your business. The following example illustrates how each attribution model would work for a hotel reservation with four touchpoints. Touchpoints Touchpoint 1: Google PPC Ad. Guest X finds your hotel website for the first time by clicking on one of your Google AdWords campaign ads for “luxury hotels in Sydney.” They browse the website and consume your content and photos. You capture their email address (with their permission, of course). Touchpoint 2: Facebook Ad. Two weeks later, Guest X returns to your website, this time from a Facebook Ad about “Things to do in Sydney.” Touchpoint 3: Email Marketing. Five days later, you send them an email about upcoming events in Sydney and why your hotel is in the best location to enjoy them. You get a click-through. Touchpoint 4: Direct Traffic. The next day Guest X books a room directly on your website by typing www.yourhotelname.com into the browser. Mission accomplished! Your attribution options Last click attribution. The last click before booking, in this case your website’s direct traffic source, gets 100% credit for the reservation. First click attribution. The first touchpoint, your Google AdWords campaign ad for “luxury hotels in Sydney,” gets 100% credit for the reservation. Linear attribution. Every touchpoint – Google AdWords, Facebook, Email and Direct – gets equal credit for the reservation (25% each). Time delay attribution. The touchpoints closest to the reservation dates get the majority of the credit. In this case, Email and Direct get most of the credit; Google AdWords and Facebook get less. Position-based attribution. The first and last touch points (Google AdWords and Direct) get 40% credit each, and the remaining 20% credit for the reservation is divided evenly between the middle touchpoints. Facebook and Email get 10% each. Data-driven attribution. This model gives credit for conversions based on the steps people have taken to find you and ultimately book a room with you. It uses data from your own account to determine which ads, keywords, and campaigns have the greatest impact on conversions. This is only available to accounts that have accumulated enough data over time. I love this model! Where can you see all this? Oh, it’s right there in your Google Analytics dashboard! Look under Conversion > Attribution. (I have always loved GA. Here is why I think it’s better than anything fancy out there) Why should you abandon last click attribution? Everyone would like to see the return on a marketing investment. It helps you justify why you did what you did, right? The cliché “what gets measured gets done” (used by folks who love management guru books) is very hard to implement in digital marketing. I want to be clear that measurement is not the enemy here. It’s how you draw insights from the data that makes or breaks your marketing campaigns and future revenue. Marketing budgets are already in very short supply in the hotel business. Imagine what happens when the allocation of these tiny budgets is determined solely by the last click that generated a booking. The result is apparent in hundreds of marketing reports today. It’s just not working anymore. It’s time to let go and move on. The booking journey The path to booking a hotel room today spans multiple websites and devices: online travel agents, metasearch, review sites, social media, etc. When you are dealing with 38 touchpoints, it’s not enough to look at the bottom of the funnel. Instead, ask yourself what you are doing to help your guest move through their booking journey. Do you think your typical pay per click brand name ad “Official Website: Book Direct And Save!” helps when someone is still researching your location? No, it doesn’t! Are you speaking with your guests on social media? Or is your Facebook strategy just serving up a “25% off for Spring Break” display ad? What about email? Is it all about 35% off your best rates? Is that the only conversation you are having with your guests? Focusing on the last touchpoint prevents you from helping your guests during the planning process, before they are ready to book. You are so busy moving marketing dollars to campaigns that target the last touchpoint that you never feed and fund top-of-the-funnel activities and channels. Ultimately, the volume is going to decline and you are going to end up playing the price game instead of selling value. Under-utilising your marketing arsenal and agency By giving 100% credit to the last click channel, you shift the focus of your marketing campaign to that one channel. All eyes are on the tool that is converting and showing a healthy return on investment. Hotel marketing agencies get stuck producing “ROI Reports” to justify their existence every single month. Fixation on one channel kicks off a vicious cycle in which your revenue numbers start to decline, you fire the agency, hire a new one, repeat. This is particularly harmful if your digital assets are not in your control and you start from the bottom every time just like Sisyphus. Your website, campaigns and data need to consistently grow over time, and not get disrupted or lost when you change vendors. Content production, photography, social media conversations, and email conversations are all part of your full marketing arsenal. Don’t go to battle with one weapon when you have a wide range of tools that allow you to target every single phase and touchpoint of the booking cycle. Others prosper while you analyze I have previously written about dinosaur metrics to avoid and super metrics to embrace. With most marketers 100% focused on the last click at the bottom of the funnel, the top-of-the-funnel playing field is wide open in the travel business. Online travel agents have done a great job of focusing on the entire travel journey. Of course, they bring tons of cash to the game and dominate paid channels…but there is a ton of work on the top of the funnel that is funded by conversions. They run, manage and curate thousands of websites that have content relating to the early stages of the travel-booking journey. As a result, they build trust and solid brand names in the travel business without owning a single bed. When you leave opportunity on the table, someone will always be there to seize it. Conclusion Booking a room at a hotel, bed and breakfast, or Airbnb is a process. First comes the destination, then the location within the destination, then a price and value comparison, and finally the right user experience to complete the booking. Judging your hotel and travel marketing campaigns at the finish line incorrectly assigns all the praise and investment to one single component. In time, your super-performing touchpoint will face a decline and stop producing revenue for you on its own. New lemons are needed to make more lemonade. Stop squeezing the life out of your campaigns by focusing on the last click. NB: This is a viewpoint from Vikram Singh, author of the Words of Vikram blog.

The real reason hotels see low ROI is 1) they’re not as good as OTAs on the product optimisation side while competing for the same SERP spots 2) most performance marketing agencies have a major conflict of interest with their clients as most charge % of total spend. Some will agree to some ROI benchmarks then like to use vague attribution models. One popular method is attributing revenue/ROI from paid branded search campaigns to the agency, which is total BS.

In addition to launching the Google Daydream mobile VR headset, it has also developed VR experiences like Tilt Brush and Google Earth VR for devices beyond its own platform. Now, with its acquisition of Owlchemy Labs, Google VR receives some new momentum. Among other polished, quirky titles, Owlchemy Labs has brought us Job Simulator and most recently, Rick and Morty: Virtual Rick-ality, a delightful and irreverent romp inspired by its namesake series from the Cartoon Network. NEW ATLAS NEEDS YOUR SUPPORT Upgrade to a Plus subscription today, and read the site without ads. It's just US$19 a year.UPGRADE NOW Job Simulator has reportedly passed US$3 million in sales – a mark of success in a still nascent market. And Rick and Morty capitalized on Simulator's uniquely VR mechanisms and hand interactions, catapulting it to new levels of singular enjoyment. Both games are refreshingly devoid of VR-induced nausea and tired gaming tropes. Rick and Morty: Virtual Rick-ality Owlchemy asserted that it will "continue building high quality VR content for platforms like the HTC Vive, Oculus Touch and PlayStation VR. This means continuing to focus on hand interactions and high quality user experiences." Beyond that promise, however, neither Google nor Owlchemy has been more specific about what they hope to accomplish by joining forces. Perhaps we'll learn more at the Google annual I/O conference next week. Either way, it seems like the move could inject some much-needed momentum and direction into VR as a whole, which became a bona fide consumer technology over the last year, but has many wondering about the future of the medium.

Digital Trends Home > Mobile > Change your voice during a call with these five… Change your voice during a call with these five wacky apps By Carlos Vega — Updated May 9, 2017 2:09 pm Subscribe Share Carlos Vega/Digital Trends Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: If you enjoy pranking your friends and family, but you’re no good at disguising your voice, then you need a voice changing app. We’ve already talked about how to block calls and how to record calls on your iPhone or Android phone, so today we’re looking at prank calls with the best apps to change your voice. Unfortunately, it’s very difficult to find voice-changing apps that work as expected. There are more apps available for Android than there are for iOS, but many in the Google Play Store are either packed with ads or don’t do what they promise. We have sifted through both Apple’s and Google’s app stores, and found five of the best voice changing apps, so you can channel your inner Bart Simpson and sound like everyone from Darth Vader to a chipmunk. Call Voice Changer Call Voice Changer is one of those apps that delivers in every way. This app allows you to change the pitch of your voice during a call and offers lots of sound effects. Before you commit to a purchase, you can use it in demo mode, which allows you to listen to yourself and find out what other people will hear. On top of that, you get two minutes free so that you can try the app out on someone before you commit to purchasing more minutes. The prices go from $1 for 3 minutes to $40 for 170 minutes. This app is available for both iOS and Android. Download now for: Android iOS Funny Call / Minion Prank Call Funny Call is also known as Minion Prank Call on Android. It’s strange the same app has different names on each platform, but it is the same app by the same developer. The interface is a little more confusing than Call Voice Changer, but once you get the hang of it, it’s easy to use. It won’t let you make a demo call, but it does let you record your voice to test the voice effects. It comes with half of the effects for free, but you will have to pay for the rest. Sadly, the app has the most intrusive kind of ads, which take up the entire screen and force you to play a game before you can close them. They don’t come up too frequently, so it isn’t too bad. You get 30 seconds for free, and then it’s $1 for 3 minutes up to $20 for 160 minutes and all premium voices forever. Download now for: Android iOS FunCall If you have an Android phone, then FunCall could be worth a look for changing your voice during calls. Like Call Voice Changer, FunCall does what it promises, and it has a very easy to use interface. This app also has a demo call feature so that you can hear what it will sound like for the other person. It doesn’t have the same number of effects that Funny Call has, but it still covers the basics with five voice effects: Helium, Woman, Man, Scary, and Regular. You can also add sound effects during the call like gun shots, a dog barking, a werewolf, and others. The calls are made using Wi-Fi, not your cellular network. Download now for: Android Voice Changer Calling This Android voice changing app is as simple as they come. When you open the app, you will see a dialer and the voice effects are in the top right corner. The app uses Wi-Fi to make the calls, and you can buy credits through the app, which cost $5, $10, and $20. The voice effects are very limited with just five to choose from. You can change your voice to deep, scary, normal, funny, and chipmunk. Download now for: Android Call Voice Changer Allogag Call Voice Changer Allogag is an interesting app. It works as an app to make calls and change your voice, and it’s very easy to use. The interface is very simple and consists of three tabs: Voice Changer, Background, and Effects. This app won’t let you make a demo call, but you can record your voice to test out the voice changer and the effects. The bad side is that it only has three settings for your voice: Lower, Normal, and Higher. You get one minute free, and then you can buy extra minutes at $1 for 4 minutes to $23 for 120 minutes. Download now for: Android
Digital Trends Home > Mobile > Google’s new mobile app feature will help… Google’s new mobile app feature will help you find something fun to do By Lulu Chang — May 11, 2017 6:49 am Subscribe Share Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: Why it matters to you If you're constantly stuck at home wondering what to do with your free time, Google can now help you find ways to keep busy. Stop staring listlessly into space when someone asks you if you have any weekend plans. Instead, just stare at Google. On Wednesday, the search giant unveiled something new for you to search: Your plans. Google’s newest feature on both the Google app and mobile web in the United States allows you to see a “clear summary of activities from sites from across the web like Eventbrite, Meetup, and more, that might be just what you’re looking for.” So when you search for a comedy show in New York, you’ll be able not only to see what venues you might want to check out, but also discover upcoming shows and even buy tickets immediately through the Google app. Cutting out all the intermediary steps that might otherwise accompany searching for your Friday night plans, Google instead allows you to check out details about various activities with a single tap of the search button. You can see an event’s title, date and time, and location, or check out “more events” to see similar options. If you find something that tickles your fancy, just tap on it to purchase tickets. Moreover, you can search for events happening in a specific time frame, so if you know that you’re taking a trip to Austin next week, you can filter your results to see what your best options may be. Or if you’re staying more local but need some inspiration for how to spend your time, just type “events near me” to see what’s happening in your neighborhood. Google is also opening up this new feature to event creators, who are invited to explore the company’s developer guidelines to see how you to boost their listings, ensuring that eager event seekers will find their offerings. “We hope this update helps you make FOMO a thing of the past,” Google concluded, “You’ve got plans to make!”

Name: Subject: Message: Google Allo can now turn your selfie picture into a sticker pack Newsby John Callaham14 hours ago 13 149 14 Our obsession with taking selfies with our smartphones continues, and likely will stick around for some time. However, what if you could use that selfie for more than just posting on Instagram or Twitter? Rolling out now to Allo on Android, Google has included a feature that will turn your selfie into a sticker pack. See also: Google Assistant in Allo: The top features you should know March 8, 2017 In a blog post, Google stated that this new Allo feature uses a combination of a computer vision algorithm with artwork created by humans to generate the sticker pack illustrations. Google started this research by experimenting with some of its neural networks, which were already programmed to ignore things they didn’t need to deal with when scanning an image. Then the development team created an algorithm based on human examples of what they see as qualitative features in a picture, such as eye color, so the neural networks could focus on those qualities in a human selfie image. Google also worked with a team of artists to help create the selection of illustrations that were needed for the sticker packs. Ultimately, there are 563 quadrillion different combinations of sticker images that can be generated from that artwork. If the sticker pack that’s generated from your selfie is not to your liking, Allo also allows you to customize the artwork with a different hairstyle, skin color, nose shape, and more. Google says the art style in this first version of the selfie sticker pack feature will be followed by others in the future, and even hints that one of them could turn your selfie into a dog. The feature will be added to the iOS version of Allo in the near future. Keep in mind that this update to the Android Allo app is just starting to roll out and it may take a few days to reach your device.

There has been no confirmation or even a hint about this as yet from either LG or Google but the rumor mill took it up nonetheless. Google has seen considerable success with the Pixel and Pixel XL so it goes without saying that it’s going to release a new handset. Now we know, though, that it won’t be manufactured by LG. A report from South Korean news outlet Chosun Biz claimed that Google was going to pick LG as the manufacturing partner for the Pixel 3 smartphone that will presumably be released in 2018. It wouldn’t be surprising if this happened. Google and LG have worked together on several Nexus smartphones in the past, such as the Nexus 4, Nexus 5, and the Nexus 5X. The report even quoted some industry experts who were of the opinion that LG may even help Google with manufacturing the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL smartphones that are due this year. LG has rubbished these rumors, though. In a statement provided to Android Authority, the company says that the report from Chosun Biz is “speculation of the highest degree.” This should be enough to understand that LG has no plans of working with Google on a Pixel smartphone, at least as it stands, whether or not something like this could happen in the future always remains a possibility.

image/svg+xml MAGAZINE EVENTS PAPERS TOPICS GOVTECH 100 NAVIGATOR SEARCH Social Facebook, Google Urged to Take More Action on Fake News Since the November election, Facebook and Google have been grappling with the issue of fake news and their roles as traffic cops on the information superhighway. by Marissa Lang, San Francisco Chronicle / May 11, 2017 Shutterstock (TNS) -- The next push for more transparency in how Facebook and Alphabet deal with fake news and hate speech may come not from users or executives, but from investors. Shareholders will go into the companies’ annual meetings next month with exhaustive research suggesting the corporations are not doing enough to stem the flow of lies and misinformation, thanks to a report released Tuesday by an organization that advocates for corporate policy changes. The report, published by the nonprofit Open Mic, recommends that Facebook and Alphabet, parent of the Google search engine and YouTube video site, release annual assessments of the impact of propaganda, fake news and hate speech, as well as what they’re doing to address those issues. Several shareholders say those policy changes would be good for business and would help restore public confidence in two of the biggest tech corporations in the world. RELATEDGoogle, Facebook Criticized for Spreading Fake NewsInvestigatation of Fake Augusta, Maine, Police Facebook Page Underway “These companies would have you believe that (fake news) is kind of a temporary hiccup that they’re experiencing,” said Michael Connor, Open Mic’s executive director. “When you dig down and find out what is at play here, there are some serious governance issues and management issues in terms of how these companies have developed technology and launched that technology into the world, and then waited until long after that to deal with the unintended results of it.” The first test of these recommendations will come in a few weeks, when Facebook investors convene for the company’s annual shareholders meeting on June 1. Natasha Lamb, managing partner of investment firm Arjuna Capital, will ask stakeholders to vote on a proposal to require that the social networking company issue a report “reviewing the public policy issues associated with fake news enabled by Facebook. The report should review the impact of current fake news flows and management systems on the democratic process, free speech and a cohesive society, as well as reputational and operational risks from potential public policy developments.” Arjuna created the proposal in conjunction with investment management firm Baldwin Brothers. Though Lamb is not confident the measure will pass, she hopes it sparks a conversation about how Facebook can be a more responsible arbiter of information. A similar proposal has been drafted and is expected to be voted on at Alphabet’s annual shareholders meeting on June 7. Open Mic’s report will bolster shareholder proposals like hers, Lamb said. “Facebook, whether they like it or not, controls the conversation,” Lamb said. “They have a responsibility to ensure their platform is not being misused by propaganda, misinformation and hate speech.” Since the November election, Facebook and Google have been grappling with the issue of fake news — misinformation meant to sow confusion and division for economic and/or political gain — and their roles as traffic cops on the information superhighway. First they cut cash flow to fake-news websites. Then they began to offer services meant to help users discern what information is true and what is not. But, in an effort to maintain distance from the controversy over fake news, the companies have largely outsourced fact-checking and turned to other organizations, or users themselves, to police the Web. “As investors, right now we’re relying on third-party analysis to determine whether or not what Facebook and Google are doing is actually effective,” Lamb said. “We saw that Google banned 200 publishers in 2016. That seems like a drop in the bucket. Did that fix the problem? How pernicious is the problem? How many people do they have on board dealing with this? These are some of the questions we want answered.” Among the recommendations outlined in Tuesday’s report, Open Mic has called for tech companies to start acting more like media companies, a term that both Facebook and Google have adamantly resisted. The organization suggests tech companies should hire “ombudspersons” or other figures to hold the companies accountable to their users and offer assessments of how corporate actions may impact the public interest. Tuesday’s report also recommends that Facebook and Alphabet publish annual impact assessments on fake news, propaganda campaigns and hate speech that “are transparent, accountable” and provide an opportunity for those affected by any fake-news crackdown to appeal. Those assessments, the Open Mic report said, should “include definitions of these terms; metrics; the role of algorithms, the extent to which staff or third parties evaluate fabricated content claims; and strategies and policies to appropriately manage the issues without negative impact on free speech.” Last month Google announced a product it calls Fact Check, which will pair headlines with a notification stating whether the claim has been verified by a reputable news agency or fact-checking organization. Facebook introduced a similar feature in partnership with fact-checking groups like PolitiFact and FactCheck.org in December. Fact-checking organizations agreed to verify questionable claims on Facebook in order to provide users an impartial assessment of accuracy. “Google and Facebook are data companies — they have billions of bits of data,” Connor said. “So what we’re saying is, show us how effective those efforts are. In the absence of facts, those efforts are just window-dressing.” Nearly two-thirds of Americans reported feeling confused about basic facts of current events and issues due to made-up news stories, according to a December study from the Pew Research Center. But fake news doesn’t just damage the reputations of big tech companies like Facebook and Google, Lamb said — it’s bad for their business. She cited fines being levied in Germany against companies that allow fake news or offensive content to remain online, investigations in the United Kingdom, and comments from American legislators on both sides of the aisle who believe the government has a responsibility to curtail the spread of fake news. “There’s a public policy risk here,” she said. “There’s also a palpable erosion of trust, which can affect how sticky these companies are.” Alphabet has been under fire since a March investigation by the Wall Street Journal found that Google had been running advertisements on YouTube videos containing hate speech or espousing white-supremacist points of view. Though this is hardly the only instance of objectionable speech on social media, Lamb said, it is the clearest example of how a company not addressing offensive content can impact its bottom line. YouTube has since lost millions in advertising as companies — including AT&T, Verizon, Pepsi and Johnson & Johnson — pulled their ads from the online video site. Last month, Google released a report that stated 0.25 percent of its daily traffic returns offensive or “clearly misleading content, which is not what people are looking for.” Facebook and Google have for months cut off fake-news sites’ access to their advertising tools in an effort to remove incentives for those who publish misleading or false content for profit. Both companies also have a list of other types of websites they ban from their advertising tools, including sites with offensive content such as hate speech and pornography. But some investors worry that by simply blocking those websites — or removing offensive content as it arises — the companies may be playing a game of Internet Whac-A-Mole without a broader strategy. “How does Google or Facebook decide what is hate speech? Who makes that call? And when they do — or an algorithm does — what happens? We don’t really know,” Connor said. “What troubles us is (policing offensive content) happens on an ad hoc basis. It’s not clear to us that it’s any part of a well-developed plan.” ©2017 the San Francisco Chronicle Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.

Google Explicitly Bans Ad Blockers From The Play Store, Except All Those Ad-Blocking Web Browsers, Apparently David Ruddock Follow View All Posts 2016/03/01 3:46pm PDTMar 1, 2016 109 Plus 1 on G+ 31 Share on Facebook 1 Share on Twitter Total Shares141 Applications Development News Google has a brand-new website for content policy on the Play Store that it unveiled today, and that's nice, but nestled away in that news was a far more interesting story regarding ad blockers. Google has long enforced a de facto ban on ad blockers on the Play Store, citing section 4.4 of the Google Play Developer Distribution Agreement, going all the way back to 2013. This involved a rather convoluted interpretation of a vague policy forbidding apps from interfering with third-party apps or services, but it's the official justification Google has used to date. Now, a new update to the Play Store Developer Policy Center (formerly Google Play Developer Program Policies) makes it clear via an example interpretation of said policy: no ad blockers. "We don’t allow apps that interfere with... other... services, including but not limited to other apps on the device, any Google service, or an authorized carrier’s network... Here are some examples of common violations: Apps that block or interfere with another app displaying ads." [emphasis ours] To be clear, this does not mark a change in policy as far as we know. It is merely the first time Google has directly acknowledged in its content policy document for the Play Store that ad blockers violate Play Store policy. Previously, if you were an ad blocker you'd just get an email pointing to section 4.4 of the old distribution agreement and pretty much nothing else. The implication was clear, but that Google never came out and said directly "ad blockers are against Play Store policy" led some to believe that maybe the policy was being misinterpreted or, perhaps, was still subject to change. Today's update to the Developer Policy Center seems to finally make clear that Google is taking a stand on ad blockers. Well, except the most popular kind: in-browser ad blockers. Yep, Google still allows browsers with ad blocking, and even plugins for browsers that add ad blocking, on the Play Store. Brave Browser, Firefox (via plugin), Adblock Browser, and Adblock Fast for the Samsung TouchWiz browsers are all still on the Play Store right now, and have been for quite some time. So, Google doesn't allow ad blockers, but apps that block ads inside themselves - like a browser - seem to be OK? The wording of Google's example in the new policy about blocking ads would seem to provide support to that position. "Apps that block or interfere with another app displaying ads." Why not just say "apps that block or interfere with the display of ads?" And I think therein lies Google's dirty little secret: ad blocking is OK... as long as it only occurs inside your own app. Google knows that ad-blocking browsers are popular enough that not having them on Android could hurt the platform. Indeed, iOS 9 received scores of headlines when news that Apple was supporting Safari ad blockers broke, and that put Google, a company funded almost exclusively by web ads, in a very awkward spot. If Google took a hard stance and banned any browser that blocked ads on the Play Store, not only would they be providing Apple ample marketing ammunition, they'd also be fighting a largely futile battle. With sideloading apps being so easy on Android, pushing users who desire a very understandable feature - ad-free web browsing - to non-Play Store channels to get such an app has very visible downsides. What if it sends more people to the Amazon Appstore? What if it results in increased malware installs on Android? Better to have people getting their ad-blocking browsers from the Play Store than elsewhere. System-wide ad blockers, by contrast, generally require control over things like setting connection proxies, and Google effectively killed Android's most popular ad blocker via a security fix that disabled automatic proxy configuration way back in Jelly Bean 4.2. And Apple, of course, doesn't allow system-wide ad blocking, either, so there's no iOS peer pressure there. The new policy site also features a number of other updates, most of them oriented around developers not being jerks to the users of their apps. Specifically, the following policies are new or updated. Ads associated with your app must not interfere with other apps, ads, or the operation of the device, including system or device buttons and ports. This includes overlays, companion functionality, or widgetized ad units. Ads must only be displayed within the app serving them. Specifically disallowed: Ads that display outside of the app serving them, Ads that are triggered by the home button or other features explicitly designed for exiting the app. The ads shown within your app must be appropriate for the intended audience of your app, even if the content by itself is otherwise compliant with our policies. [Explainer: no mature ads in an app rated OK for kids.] Apps that collect your phone book or contact data must provide a privacy policy. All in all, positive changes. And a continued awkward and unstated gray area of permitted existence for ad blocking browsers.

Not available on the Playstore but it squashed ads system wide on my Android devices. So nice, I installed the chrome extension on my PC and Macs. tim242 Adgard is quite lovely, and no root required! Vladimir Where can I get this app? Can't find a concrete website for it! wjrandon If you search Google it's the first result. Nathan J Do you use Chrome on the desktop? Highlight the word (even the misspelled one), right click, Search Google for [highlighted text]. Great feature, easily and often overlooked. I think you can do a similar thing on mobile. Vladimir I was searching for "adgard". Duh. ProductFRED I mean this is pretty much always been the case. I've rooted every Android phone I've owned and although I love using Adaway, I'd never expect it to be on the Play Store. Before people jump down my throat about "stealing from developers", I'd like to kindly ask that they stop implementing intrusive ads (Interstitial ads; ads that take up the entire screen and have a tiny x in the corner) with no option to pay to remove them. Albert Kilger I always pay for the app that I like. But, like you, I run adaway. It doesn't really get much better than that. Thankfully we still can root to do that. Otherwise our garden isn't so open. tim242 Adgard works great, no root required. ProductFRED Adguard is proxy based (so battery drain) vs Adaway's host blocking. But as you sad the benefit is no root necessary. tim242 Adgard filters through your device, via local VPN. There is no battery drain. Basically Chrome battery usage goes down to almost nothing, and its battery usage is seen on adgard, since it is filtering. Chrome used to use 20-25% of my battery. Now it never gets over 5%, while adgard shows about 15%. So there is no more battery drain, and most times a little less. ASYOUTHIA Same, I haven't noticed any difference with adguard George Byers 15% > No Battery Drain??? tim242 The Chrome battery usage transfers to Adguard. I thought I made that pretty clear. William i rooted every device until my GS6, because i could do it without losing the warranty,but with KNOX, it's impossible to do that, i used Adaway on the rooted phones,but now i'm using Adguard :) YaKillaCJ Screw the warranty. If something goes wrong, U "lost" it. Same price. Oops did I say that out loud haha. Don't listen to me tho, I'm a bad influence. Besides I but my phones flat out, no service provider warranty. But an oem warranty that's good threw root Jumbeau KNOX isn't just about warranty, that's the problem. YaKillaCJ I hear ya. But knox only plus is for business use or byod for work use. For me tho, I trip it with no hesitation because root far outweighs stock. I ain't worried about the warranty because the tech wont see that device again reguardless. That's just my personal opinion, usecase tho ASYOUTHIA I've been using adguard, I can say that I haven't noticed a difference in battery life on my V10, I used to use Adaway but root isn't available ...yet Fatal1ty_93_RUS Funny, it's draining more battery but doesn't slow the system down as much. At least on desktop KG Adguard was draining my N6P battery to the point I had to stop using it. ~20% by the end of day. But it did work great in blocking ads tim242 It was not draining your battery. Chrome batter usage was showing mostly for adguard. That happens because Adguard is processing your browser traffic. My Chrome battery usage used to be over 20%, but using Adguard brought Chrome down to 5% range. Ankit Gupta Thanks for that! Trying it out now, seems good so far. Lexster Yeah, I honestly think every app that has a free version should also have an ad free version available for a few dollars. I'm very willing to support developers, but I hate ads that interrupt gameplay or interaction with the app. It certainly doesn't make me want to purchase whatever the ad is trying to sell. Larry Simpson I do the same thing with all of my phones Artem Russakovskii Indeed. That's why it says: To be clear, this does not mark a change in policy as far as we know. It is merely the first time Google has directly acknowledged in its content policy document for the Play Store that ad blockers violate Play Store policy. EarlyMon Ummm... What?! http://www.androidpolice.com/2013/03/13/breaking-google-has-begun-purging-ad-blocking-apps-from-the-play-store/ Not the first time acknowledging this at all compadre. Artem Russakovskii I'm not sure you've read the story. Section 4.4 is mentioned twice in there, including the post you're linking to. EarlyMon I read the story very carefully. TFA says, "Previously, if you were an ad blocker you'd just get an email pointing to section 4.4 of the old distribution agreement and pretty much nothing else." However the AP report said two years ago, "According to Android developer Jared Rummler and a number of other sources, Google has begun purging known ad-blocking software from the Play Store today." That's certainly not an email pointing to the policy and pretty much nothing else. MelanieWDavis "my .friend's mate Is getting 98$. HOURLY. on the internet.".... two days ago new McLaren.

MJ Reading comprehension is not a core skill of yours is it? EarlyMon See my polite rebuttal to Artum. Have a cookie for being so clever that you didn't notice that you're the one with the problem you describe. I accept your apology. MJ Your rebuttal has only confirmed you haven't comprehended this article or Artem's original comment. LOL EarlyMon First we have a guy claiming that Adaway was never on the Play Store when it very certainly was, Artum agreeing with him and the premise is that no drastic action was taken before as Jellybean sewed up proxy settings. Adaway is a hosts file name resolver, nothing to do with a proxy, was available from the Play Store and purged with everything like it two years ago - a drastic action. It's official - you're an idiot. :D MJ So you are now going to ignore the issue I was referring to and are instead talking about something I haven't commented about? OK... I guess you are just going to continue to refuse to read this post and Artem's first comment. You do know it's makes you look like a real loser when start with the name calling especially when you wouldn't ever call me an idiot to my face right? EarlyMon I'd call you one to your face laughing like a bud and wouldn't mind the same in return, afterwards and during we'd have a beer and laugh about it, no big deal. :D As far as your original comment and Artum's is concerned - you need to get off your high horse that I can't read well and that I've changed the subject when I never did. Artum said that they didn't take drastic action before - quoted for your reading convenience - and that's simply not true. He agreed with a guy who spouted a false claim. I responded to both because they're matters of fact that are easily checked. Thanks for the reading comprehension advice, try taking it yourself. You're clearly not following the discussion. Bonus points for crying about the friendly idiot thing after jumping me for reading comprehension (the Internet equivalent of calling someone an idiot in a condescending way and you know that as does everyone). Bravo - I've made you some more cookies! :D EarlyMon Nope. Once upon a time you could get root adblockers that build /etc/hosts just like Adaway in the Android Market. MJ Adaway is totally not necessary in my opinion... I wouldn't ever install an app that servers ads to me that I can't pay to remove. Problem solved! JeanClaude But would you be willing to pay as much as the ads pays the dev? EowynCarter If you think there is too much ads, just uninstall the app. Roh_Mish Websites do everything in its power to block such kinds of ad. Unfortunately, Google and other ad providers still sometimes deliver such ads and it's not possible to block it. Nathan J You kind of have to expect, that with Google being an advertising company, they're not going to let you block ads on their mobile OS that they're giving OEMs for free. That would be awfully generous of them to do so. Though it is kind of trashy to have ads on a 5" screen. I use a system-wide ad blocker (AdAway) but I buy ad removers/Pro versions. I support developers. But I've had ads attempt to deliver ransomware, and though I was skilled enough to evade the attack, I'd just as soon prevent it from happening in the future. Marty Umm...Google isn't giving Android away free out of generosity. Google can't sell Android because Google doesn't own all the code in Android. Apple, Microsoft and Oracle own some of the code in Android. If Google were to ever try to make a profit on Android by selling it like Microsoft does with Windows, Apple, Microsoft and Oracle would have them in court quickly. Lateef Alabi-Oki wat? Google absolutely owns all the code in Android. The reason Android is "free" is because of its license. Please show me the code Apple, Microsoft and Oracle contributed to Android. And by Android, I mean AOSP. https://source.android.com/ Marty Nope. Not true. In fact, Microsoft levies a royalty on every Android device sold. The royalty was 5 dollars. Not sure if it went up or not. But it's well known Microsoft makes more money on Android than Google does. And Apple under Steve Jobs wanted to destroy Android rather than license it's use to Google. I think Google and Apple have since come to some kind of agreement. But it's been well known since the beginning that Google doesn't own all of Android. Lateef Alabi-Oki Microsoft being a patent troll doesn't mean they contributed anything to Android. Marty None of these companies deliberately contributed anything to Android. But their code was found in Android. Oracle decided to take Google to court over some aspects of Android code. Don't remember who won. But the only part of Android that Google fully owns are their own proprietary apps like the Play Store, Maps, Gmail and such. And Google used to charge a licensing fee to OEMs for these proprietary apps. I've read that they have done away with that fee. Lateef Alabi-Oki The point I'm making is that Google OWNS Android. Not Apple. Not Microsoft. Not Oracle. Microsoft's patent dispute with Android OEMs is most likely the result of Linux being able to read and write FAT/NTFS storage partitions. Linux developers reverse engineered the process almost a decade ago and Microsoft is claiming intellectual property infrigement. Miscrosoft tried to use SCO to go agains the Linux community years ago and failed miserably in the court of law. Microsoft patent trolling is nothing new. It's their modus operandi. They know Google won't stand for their shenanigan. That's why they've never sued Google directly and instead have gone after Android OEMs, who are intimidated by MS. Oracle is claiming copyright infrigement of Google's use of Java in Android. Most programmers, like myself, think Oracle is just batshit crazy because making APIs copyrightable is almost as retarded as making arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, division and multiplication copyrightable. But it's not surprising Oracle would stoop this low because among the IT community there's a consensus that Oracle is a shitty organization. As for Apple, Steve Jobs was just butthurt over the fact that Android was inevitably going to become the most dominant and influencial operating system on the planet, and there was nothing he could do to stop it. He thought Android was going to be a fatal threat to the iPhone and his company, hence is desperate thermo nuclear threat. It turns out his fears was all for naught. None of these means that Oracle, Apple or Microsoft own Android. None of these has anything to do with the fact that Android is free. Android is free because Google made a smart and strategic move to license it under an open source license. Marty Look up the royalty fee that MS get from Google on every Android device sold. And Apple does have code in Android. Lateef Alabi-Oki Google does not pay MS a royalty fee. Some Android OEMs do, but not Google. The Android source code is completely open, please point me to Apple's code in it. Marty I'll have to refer you to Apple for that information. I'm not a dev or in the industry. I just remember reading all this in the distant past. The fact that MS gets a royalty fee confirms they own part of Android. Stoffers Ah, you read an article on the interwebs, it must be true, you must be correct. You think you read it You read it It's true. That's not how it works. Stoffers The patent system is broken, that does not mean Microsoft, Apple, or Oracle own even a slight bit of Android. Jumbeau You mix a lot of things. There's no code from outside companies, they just patented some stuff here and there the way how to use a "mobile tech". If there would be some of their code, their wouldn't be oem arrangements, there would be legal actions against android and Google. As for Oracle, it's a whole different story about some Java mobile API being open source in Google's opinion but not in Oracle's. Nathan J Okay, this is all irrelevant to my original post, but this is flat-out wrong: "And Apple under Steve Jobs wanted to destroy Android rather than license it's use to Google. I think Google and Apple have since come to some kind of agreement." No. Android never belonged to Apple. It was never Steve Jobs's to license to Apple. In no uncertain terms, das ist kuhsheiße. Steve Jobs said Android was a stolen product because of multi-touch. Apple did not invent the touch screen, and I don't think they invented multi-touch, but they marketed the hell out of it and at least attempted to patent it. They released the iPhone six months before Android came out in a production phone, though it existed longer. Jobs felt that Android stole the idea from him. I don't think he was wholly wrong for feeling that way, but I'm glad he did not succeed in hindering Android, as it's my platform of choice. I do wish he followed through with his promises and released an iPhone running OS X (because you shouldn't have to get all new, phone specific apps, as he said) and with no face buttons. The iPhone he initially announced was a flat out lie that, nine years later, has yet to surface. Marty I didn't say Apple owned all of Android. I said Apple owned some code found in Android. That's what the big news was a long time ago. It was widely reported that Apple had code in Android. If that isn't true, fine. But Google does not own Android fully. Some of its code is from MS and others. Nathan J You said Steve Jobs didn't want to license Android to Google. That's complete BS. You misread something. The Microsoft thing is Microsoft's patent on FAT (File Allocation Table), a file system. Any phone that supports it must pay Microsoft. Google gets away with not paying Microsoft by using a different internal format and not including an SD card slot. Every phone with an SD card slot owes Microsoft a couple bucks (maybe five, I don't recall). Nexus phones are sold on razor thin margins, so rather than adding $5-10 to the price, they just skip the feature. Apple never owned any part of Android. Apple claimed Google copied features. There's (most likely, I cannot say for sure) no Apple code in Android. I mean, there might be QuickTime support, but that's something Apple would license. No part of iOS exists in Android, in any case. If you want to know where both came from, iOS and the iPhone evolved from the iPod. The idea was to stick a phone in an iPod so consumers wouldn't have to carry both, they could just carry one device. Android phones evolved from ultra-mobile PCs. Largely unavailable in America, but one was featured in 24. Chloe's boyfriend used one. It was about the size of your average paperback, had a slide-out keyboard, full size USB ports, and it ran Windows XP. Android phones are just smaller versions of that running touch screen Linux (sort of). The ideas ultimately converged in the design we now know. Stoffers If it was widely reported how is it that you can't find it? Marty Because I haven't bothered to look for it. And I just don't care. :P Stoffers Yet you post many comments about the issue? Sounds like "I just don't care" Marty I don't care to comb through the web to find information from way back then. It isn't as difficult recalling my own memory. But if someone wants to refute me, which has happened, I just don't care. It's absolutely not that important to me. Drew M You're confusing software patents with actual source code written in C and C++. It's not the same thing. Furthermore, if Microsoft and Apple contributed code to Android, they wouldn't retain "ownership" of it because Android is licensed and distributed under the Apache license, making it a derivative work. Nathan J They're making a profit by advertising, and if you block ads, you're depriving them of that. That's my point. Not touching the rest of your post, partly because I have no opinion and partly because it's not relevant. Marty Anyone else notice how precise you have to be when selecting Gmail "Promotions" emails for deletion? More times than not when trying to select one it opens. I figure this is something Google does deliberately and it's freaking annoying. Chrome Android browser has something similar. When trying to scroll a website, sometime the display will open an ad like it detected a deliberate tap. Another super annoying thing about the Android environment. Jeffrey Tarman I don't see that crap when using Inbox. Marty I tried Inbox. Didn't like it and it isn't yet multi-account. Jeffrey Tarman I check both Gmail & yahoo with it Marty You must have a special one. I just installed Inbox from the Play Store and tried to add an account...in this case, a Hotmail account...and it doesn't allow me to add anything but a Google account. Jeffrey Tarman No, I added my yahoo account via Gmail to take advantage of gmailify features & my yahoo emails show up. I can also send from yahoo via Inbox. Inbox also doesn’t show the stupid ads that Gmail does. https://www.flickr.com/gp/tarbaby/p5F3S6 Marty It must just be Yahoo then that is allowed to show in Gmail because I have a POP3/IMAP and Hotmail account added in Gmail and they don't show up in Inbox. Jeffrey Tarman Yeah, I was having issues with my outlook.com account. It was one or the other but not both. vcb If Apple allows system-wide content blockers, I'll buy an iPhone in a heartbeat. tim242 You can get that on Android, no root required. Adgard. Paul_Werner True but they want you to pay a subscription fee if you want it system-wide. That and there are still a few ads that crop up in other apps using Adguard. I just tested and the ad at the bottom of MapMyFitness showed up even though the one in the hamburger menu on the left was hidden tim242 Adgard premium offers a mobile lifetime license for $25. Well worth it. I'm not rooted, and using the VPN device filtering. Not a single ad gets through. Marty Single device or multi? tim242 It says one, or more. Not sure on the specifics. It's free for browser ad blocking. It only costs if you want to block in other apps. Marty I probably would only use ad blocking in a browser. I have zero problems paying app devs for any ad-free experience that I like. To block ads in free apps that have paid ad-free versions feels like ripping them off. tim242 Same here. I only use it for the browser. It makes browsing so much better. I only use apps with no ads, whether free or paid. I always buy ad free versions when available Paul_Werner Well during the trial it seemed to let that one get thru. I wonder if it was an ad tied to the company that owns MapMyFitness however and that's how it happened Marty Yup. Side loading. You can't do that in iOS...non jail broken. Ignacio Zippy I don't care that much about ad blocking but it's enough reason to switch. Apple is supposed to be the “evil” one… Ronan Agree. I feel Android OS is becoming more and more restricted. Android is not much different than iOS nowadays, much of Android advantage & 'freedom' had been stripped since 4.3. I'm seriously thinking about switching to iOS in near future. Don't worry though, I'll still visiting Android Police every week ;) Singh Khalsa What are you talking about? Android is getting more and more restricted?! Are you out of your mind?! In Android 6.0, we got the ability to allow and disallow induvidual app permisions. HotelQuebec Stop taking drugs. iOS is a lot more restrictive and suffers from feature fragmentation. For example, ad blocking isn't supported on 32-bit iOS devices when there's no technical reason it shouldn't work since Adguard for Android works fine on 32-bit Android devices. MJ Why? Personally, I won't ever install an app that servers ads to me that I can't pay to remove. Problem solved... mark Keyword being "if". It's like the bogeyman. "I'm going to get a windows phone, that'll show'em!" At least here such apps can be distributed and installed via other sites, good luck doing that for ios. charlie Jason Very unlikely. andy_o This is kind of old, but just to let you know that there is actually: AdBlock by FutureMind https://appsto.re/us/R2AmP.i I don't know why this isn't more well known. There is that, and there is also Weblock, also by the same developers. The difference is that Weblock is only a proxy, so only works over WiFi, though if you have an OpenVPN account, you can append a code Weblock generates to the OpenVPN profile to block ads via your VPN. AdBlock is much simpler to use though. Basically works just like Adguard on Android, but it's actually on the App Store, ironically regarding this Apple seems to be more open than Google. I've been using Weblock for more than a year now on my iPad mini, and AdBlock for a couple of weeks on the iPad Pro, both work just fine. There is something about the Google App on iOS though, where these don't work for webpages opened within the app. I think Google may be using its data saver proxy without telling us. They do work for Chrome though, and Firefox. EarlyMon So what about firewalls? registration_stinks I pay for the packets to come to my devices. What I choose to display once they arrive is my business. The intrusive arrogance of these mercenaries makes me long for the days of text based websites. For those sites that go so far as to "deny" views to people running ad blockers, there is always Firebug. Francois The ads aren't so much the problem as opposed to websites that use them in a way to make your browsing experience frustrating if not ruining it. Same for websites and writers that use "shit*y /false titles" as click bait so we might go on their ad infested website .... ie "Android X release date and Nexus Z retail price" while we don't know for sure the release date of android but if we look at the past couple of years you can expect it between now and then and the device should go between such and such... And keep serving the same article for 3 months only changing the title every week ! Now how about those ads that when you thing the site has finished loading finally and you proceed to click on the link you want but oops the page repositions itself all of a sudden and you get redirected to the same freaking yellow pages website you don't give a rat's ass about for the 100th time this month... They are the reason adblockers are so popular. By being greedy they shoot themselves in the foot blindexecutioner My wife has a note 5 and can't use adblock fast. Does any Samsung phone have the necessary browser and how do you get it? The app simply says there should be an update pushed to the device but I've never heard of an ota from a manufacturer just updating a browser. godutch For Internet 4.0 was part of the marshmallow update, Samsung might also release it in their store or the play store too George Byers Firefox for android & ublock origin blindexecutioner I use adaway but still pay for apps I use if they have a pay option. I know I'm probably in the minority though. I also disable my adblocker on YouTube to help out the content providers since Google's ads aren't so bad. Most websites serve up very obnoxious ads though so I have to keep the blocker enabled most of the time. Patrick Smithopolis It makes sense to me. If a browser has ad blocking built in then that's the way the developer wants the browser to be used. On the other hand, ad blocking apps interfere with the intended use of other apps. Tomfoolery It's a matter of time before ad blockers will be banned from Chrome Desktop... At which point many users will defect to Firefox. Gregory There's no way one can ban something on a desktop OS. dude Well they do within their browser, there used to be extensions to download youtube videos but they removed it for Chrome. Gregory Well, they obviously can remove anything from their web store, but in no way they can prevent users from installing those extensions from other sources. Alex I thought they'd already done that? I had some sideloaded extensions that broke a while back because Chrome blocked extensions that aren't from the store. Maybe there's a developer mode that allows it, I haven't looked. The extensions were removed for download from their sites and added to the chrome store. Fatal1ty_93_RUS Except they don't allow sideloading extensions anymore since last year Slowpoke I still can sideload extensions if I activate the "Developer mode" (idk the actual name in English). https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/d6e3179323ad5abc3b7d15edd332442d36779055c340c67c89543e23dcaf4956.png Fatal1ty_93_RUS Well what about this then? http://www.windowscentral.com/google-blocks-sideloading-chrome-extensions Slowpoke It might only be in Google Chrome and not in Chromium (which I use). YaKillaCJ In no time. Adblock Plus and The Great Suspender are required. Get rid of either and Firefox here I come. Tomfoolery Try uBlock Origin instead of Adblock Plus, it's a lot lighter. Also, the dev for Adblock Plus is a little shady, to say the least. OrionBeast Ad company ... Blocking ad lockers. Ok google how do I throw away my phone? dude I like Ghostery browser, it's block trackers but consequently ads as well. And its easy to whitelist sites. luqman_98 AdAway ftw! cvm I use a custom host on my phone. So i never installd an adblocker on my phone. D.Smithee To me, Google Chrome for Android is completely useless without extensibility. And that's why I use Firefox. Kwetsima Maluleke I use Ad Block Fast and download Crystal just in case Google decides to remove them from the store because it's obvious Google doesn't want us with Samsung's to have nice things. George Byers Firefox is always there :) Edward Palomares Jr Going on ign.com wait 3 seconds for a ad to appear then wait a mother 3 seconds for it to go away .same with vgchartz.com and other websites it's ruining my experience YaKillaCJ AdAway is the way to go. Nearly all my Apps are legally purchased. Still some don't have the option. Plus some websites have very irritating Adds. Dare I point out I never noticed how irritating Android Police bugged me and reminded me to run AdAway after I updated. Don't get me wrong, I give back here too via the great deals y'all post. I block others like YouTube and Pandora with no remorse because they subscription price too high in my eyes for Apps I use one every two weeks. I have a device with limited screen real estate, battery, high speed data, storage, ram. Forced Ads I will not except. I gladly purchase worthy apps and support developers (right after I pirate to give it a full test lol). George My next phone is going to be an iPhone, and this adds to the list of reasons (plus list of features iOS has and Android lacks... Which is becoming huge recently). jineshpatel30 huh ? https://media.giphy.com/media/vCHKWBlygEAtG/giphy.gif Charlie Seems pretty simple, make a browser that supports ad-blocking. That's fine. Don't make an app that blocks ads in other apps, because you're kind of stealing the bread and butter of that app. I do think that means they should ban ad-blocking browser plugins too though. Unless the plugin is somehow officially supported or endorsed by the app. But if you were to take the rule very strictly, that would also mean that those apps that downgrade pictures and videos to save data, and do it system wide (via a VPN, or rerouting of all the data that is sent and received on the phone) would also have to be banned. But what the consequences are of the app might also play a role. That doesn't really hurt another app that much, ad blocking does. mark I think the distinction makes some sense though. In one case, an app decides how to display content it's downloaded. In another case, an app is interfering with behaviour of other apps. It's a shame this affects ad blocking, but the latter is something that has security and stability implications, which doesn't apply to modifications made to a website. I'm not saying I agree with it, but I don't think comparing to web blocking makes sense. Sid Sun Just Root your phone and Install Xposed if 6.0.x there is an unofficial version on XDA install it and install the ad blocker module and that's it! RainMotorsports You guys are wrong. It's not a gray area. It's not even about ads. Google used specific wording because that was their pure intent. While they do have their own ad services to worry about, it is also a separate issue. When you run a platform that depends on 3rd party developers you have to make them happy even if it means pissing off users. Ad blocking browsers affect none of these developers in the market itself. However ad blocking their apps affects them as well as any apps that remove limitations. It's very clear in how console manufacturers have handled similar situations. YouNex I am seeing websites using ads telling me "you are using an ad blocker" since Chrome 48/49 I don't use an ad blocker. Bone stock. What. The. F***. Google ? I can't even disable it because it IS NOT SUPPOSED to be here in the first place. Moose05 Fuck you Google! You haven't made a dime off me in years and will never do so. I'll continue to block every single ad in existence on MY devices. George Byers You make yourself sound like an entitled twat Moose05 Good. Fuck em Koloses There DNS servers with ad blocking Channel 2012 What's the big deal?

U.S. Editions Australia Edition China Edition India Edition Italy Edition Japan Edition Singapore Edition United Kingdom United States May 12, 2:39 AM EDT Subscribe Search Search Business Technology World National Media & Culture Millennial Money Entertainment Sports Subscribe Technology LG Denies Report Claiming It Will Build Google's Pixel 3 In 2018 By Ken Manbert Salcedo On 05/11/17 AT 11:13 AM Close It was reported earlier today that LG will be Google’s partner for the Pixel 3 smartphones in 2018. However, LG quickly denied the report stating that it was mere speculation. Google was reported to have been searching for a new partner for the third generation Pixel phones to provide “more stability” in terms of manufacturing, according to the South Korean site Chosun Biz. The site claimed that Google has found that new partner in LG, which may also help HTC in manufacturing the Pixel 2 and Pixel XL 2 later this year. The report was convincing to say the least as Google and LG have partnered several times in the past. LG was one of Google’s partners in making Nexus devices. Together both companies were able to release the Nexus 4, Nexus 5 and the Nexus 5X. Last year, Google changed its strategy and decided to only partner with HTC for the Pixel and Pixel XL. The launch of both devices also marked the end of the Nexus brand. Google was able to sell 5 million Pixel phones, but the company believes that it would have been able to have sold more if it didn’t have supply constraint during its launch. Google also invested 1 trillion won or around $880 million in LG’s OLED display division. Chosun Biz’s report also stated that Google wanted to secure LG’s OLED displays, the same way Apple partnered with Samsung Display to get OLED displays for this year’s iPhones. Lastly, LG is said to have agreed to partner with Google in order to increase its smartphone revenue. The Pixel brand’s popularity has already helped in securing revenue growth for HTC. “We have reached out to LG for further comment, and Ken Hong, the company’s global communications director, has firmly denied the report.” — Android Authority The global communications director also added that the report by the Korean media is “speculation of the highest degree” and that LG does not “deal in rumors and speculation.” For now, there’s no truth to the report that Google has partnered with LG for the Pixel 3. Even if its true that Google and LG have partnered for the Pixel 3, neither of them would ever confirm it. After all, Google is still working on the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL, which are both still being built by HTC. Speaking of the second generation Pixel phones, rumors are already circulating about Google’s flagship device for 2017. The most recent and popular rumor going around is that the Google Pixel 2 will be powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 835 processor, the same chipset that’s in Samsung’s Galaxy S8. Another rumor making rounds online is that Google might also introduce a third Pixel device this year that’s currently codenamed as “Taimen.” This is in keeping with Google’s fondness of using types of fishes as codenames. The Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL are codenamed “Walleye” and “Muskie.” The device is now being referred to as the Pixel 2 XXL, and some believe that it might be a tablet or a smartphones that’s LG says that the report claiming that it will build Google's Pixel 3 smartphone in 2018 is pure speculation.

That’s because the Washington Post issued the following update to their story wherein they claimed that Spicer was hiding in the bushes after President Donald Trump fired FBI Director James Comey. “EDITOR’S NOTE: This story has been updated to more precisely describe White House press secretary Sean Spicer’s location late Tuesday night in the minutes before he briefed reporters. Spicer huddled with his staff among bushes near television sets on the White House grounds, not ‘in the bushes,’ as the story originally stated.” The original article from the Washington Post spoke about Spicer’s short interview with Fox Business on the grounds of the White House late Tuesday evening. The report from the Washington Post claimed that Spicer was having an impromptu meeting with staff from the White House nearby bushes, and then moved behind a tall hedge. The Washington Post article went on to claim that Spicer had to pass a cluster of reporters who would likely want to question him about President Trump’s controversial firing of Comey, in order for Spicer to return to his office. As a result, Spicer agreed to speak briefly with journalists as long as there was no video of Spicer’s interview recorded. “[Spicer] disappeared into the shadows, huddling with his staff near a clump of bushes and then behind a tall hedge. To get back to his office, Spicer would have to pass a swarm of reporters wanting to know why President Trump suddenly decided to fire the FBI director…After Spicer spent several minutes hidden in the darkness and among the bushes near these sets, Janet Montesi, an executive assistant in the press office, emerged and told reporters that Spicer would answer some questions, as long as he was not filmed doing so. Spicer then emerged.” That’s why photos of Spicer like the ones below and above are darkened, due to Spicer commanding that the camera lights be turned off. Some of the camera lights from the broadcast camera can still be seen in photos that have emerged of Spicer’s interview. “‘Just turn the lights off,’ Spicer ordered. ‘Turn the lights off. We’ll take care of this.'” WH Press Secretary Sean Spicer speaks to reporters about the firing of FBI Director Comey as he walks into the West Wing. #FBIDirector pic.twitter.com/c2SNG63lIr — Doug Mills (@dougmillsnyt) May 10, 2017 The interview with Spicer has caused the hashtag #SpicerBushes to become a thing on Twitter. However, with reporters eager to interview Spicer about the thought process behind President Trump’s firing of former FBI Director Comey, there is no readily available video coverage of what Spicer said to journalists near the bushes that night. According to the Washington Post, Spicer’s sudden news conference came prior to Spicer taping TV interviews in the West Wing. After Comey firing, what led to the Spicer briefing taking place in the dark, around the bushes? https://t.co/ipeHGhW6Of — Alisyn Camerota (@AlisynCamerota) May 11, 2017 The fallout from Spicer’s news conference near the bushes, along with the melee over the Washington Post’s correction stating that Spicer was among the bushes and not in the bushes has given birth to articles like “The Daily Spicer: Bushes Edition” from the publication. In that opinion piece, Spicer was described as struggling to conduct the sudden interview near the bushes that night. Spicer stood in the darkness near the bushes while attempting to answer questions about recent White House happenings. In addition, memes like the following are breaking out on Twitter, with folks using Photoshop and other photo-editing software to place Spicer in a variety of hedges and bushes. People are also likening Spicer to Homer Simpson, hiding in the bushes. BREAKING: Sean Spicer will be conducting his press conference from the White House bushes today … pic.twitter.com/fjRP6HtwZy — Steven R. Walker (@Steve_R_Walker) May 11, 2017 With the correction to Spicer standing nearby the bushes instead of in the bushes, it is likely that memes about Spicer hiding in bushes will continue to be published on social media.

According to the Mountain View, California company’s annual Economic Impact Outlook report, some 15,000 Connecticut businesses, website publishers and nonprofits benefited from using Google’s advertising tools AdWords and AdSense. Google also said that $6.86 million of free advertising was provided to Connecticut nonprofits through the Google Ad Grants program. Nationwide, the company said its tools helped generate $222 billion of economic activity for 1.5 million businesses, website publishers, and nonprofits in 2016. The survey cited Interactive Advertising Bureau data showing that $1.12 trillion, or 6 percent of U.S. gross domestic product, was generated by the internet last year – a figure that has more than doubled since 2012, growing at five times the average U.S. GDP growth rate. The report further noted that 10.4 million jobs were created across the nation by the internet in 2016, with 86 percent of that activity taking place outside major tech hubs.

To further incentivize SEOs, Google announced that HTTPS is a ranking signal that can give your site a small ranking benefit. Despite the potential SEO benefits, the majority of sites aren’t migrating to HTTPS, according to a study by SEMrush (disclosure: I work for SEMrush). Our team analyzed the popularity of HTTPS over the past few years and discovered the HTTPS usage trend in different industries and among the top global companies. This study follows on statistics Google provided last year on the use of HTTPS on popular websites, which were chosen based on Google’s own internal data and publicly available Alexa data. Findings showed that these websites accounted for approximately 25 percent of all website traffic on the Internet. Also, according to Statoperator, as of June 2016, 10.2 percent of Alexa top 1 million websites used HTTPS by default. Let’s dig into the latest results. HTTPS Usage Among the Top 100,000 Websites By scrutinizing the top 100,000 domains (according to SEMrush Rank’s U.S. database), the SEMrush team discovered that HTTPS usage has tripled among these sites between 2014 and 2017. Over the past three years, the percentage of these sites that are marked with a green padlock on your browser’s address bar has increased from 7.6 percent to 31.5 percent. That means 31,549 out of 100,000 are now using HTTPS. HTTPS Usage Among the Top 5,000 Websites by Industry The next part of the study was to determine how many of the top 5,000 domains divided into 25 industries (according to SEMrush Rank) are using HTTPS. SEMrush found out that 41 percent of these sites were using HTTPS in 2017. When it comes to industries, 316 of Arts & Entertainment websites used HTTPS, which made this category the industry with the highest number of sites secured with HTTPS. The three industries with the highest percentage of HTTPS usage were Finance (77 percent), Internet & Telecom (63.91 [percent), and Business & Industrial (62 percent). As for non-HTTPS websites, according to the findings, the industries with the lowest percentages of HTTPS were News (11.25 percent) and Sports (15.95 percent). HTTPS Usage Among the Fortune 500 by Sector For the purpose of this research, SEMrush also analyzed the largest U.S. corporations to find out how many of the top global businesses have already moved to HTTPS. By exploring companies in the Fortune 500 list, the team discovered an interesting HTTPS usage trend. Companies with the highest percentage of HTTPS usage were in the Financial (70 percent) and Business Services (74 percent) sectors. On the other hand, the companies with the lowest percentage of HTTPS usage were in the Aerospace & Defense and Chemicals industries, with 8 percent and 9 percent of HTTPS websites, respectively. HTTPS Usage and Its Correlation to Google Rankings To check for any correlation between SERP positions and HTTPS usage, our team sampled 100,000 random keywords. Nearly 45 percent of results in the first position and nearly 50 percent of results in the second position were secured with HTTPS, according to the data. The difference between the first and the second position can be explained by the influence of other more important ranking factors on the top result on the SERP. Although the first position had a lower percentage of HTTPS sites than the second and third positions, the analysis showed an interesting trend on the rest of the first page. The number of sites on the first page that were using HTTPS was steadily decreasing from positions 2 through 10. These findings as a whole supported the idea that HTTPS usage can influence website rankings on Google. What Does HTTPS Actually Do? Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) is the secure version of HTTP, the standard protocol used for communication over the Internet. Development of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) was initiated by Tim Berners-Lee, a British computer scientist and the inventor of the World Wide Web, in as early as 1989. For nearly 18 years, it has been the most popular application protocol used for communication on the Internet. However, communication over HTTP alone isn’t as safe as it used to be. Any unprotected HTTP request can potentially reveal information about users. This information can be intercepted, spied on, and even manipulated by hackers. Therefore, an increasing number of websites are now implementing HTTPS, which was developed to protect the integrity and confidentiality of data over the Internet. HTTPS is a form of encryption that keeps site visitors’ information safe. It has been known nearly as long as the World Wide Web itself. Nevertheless, historically, HTTPS connection was primarily used for payment transactions by websites that dealt with money. In the course of time, more websites of various types began to use it, aiming at securing their users’ accounts and keeping their identity and communications private. HTTPS pages use SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) or TLS (Transport Layer Security) protocols to encrypt communications. As a result, servers and clients still communicate with each other using the same HTTP, but over a secure SSL/TLS connection that encrypts their requests and connections. With an HTTPS connection, all communication between a server and a client is securely encrypted, making it more difficult for hackers to intercept, manipulate, or steal information from your server. 3 Benefits of Moving to HTTPS Switching your site to HTTPS provides you and your site’s visitors with multiple benefits. Here are three. 1. Security & Privacy As mentioned previously, the main advantage of HTTPS is that it makes your website more secure for your users. HTTPS is especially important on web pages where users provide their highly sensitive information (e.g., card information and other personal details). When visitors are interacting with your site, they expect a secure and private online experience. 2. Trust Imagine that a user lands on your site and then sees a security warning message from Google. In fact, if a server pretends to be on HTTPS, but its certificate doesn’t match, then most browsers will display a warning behavior. In this scenario, the user is likely to click the back button because they can’t trust your website. As a result, this can damage your site’s authority and reputation. HTTPS helps your site gain a higher level of trust with your users. 3. Referral Data Google Analytics becomes even more useful when you move your site to HTTPS. Unlike HTTP, with HTTPS, the security data of the website that referred you is saved. Anna Crowe points out that when traffic comes to your HTTP site, it appears to be “direct” in your analytics report, which isn’t helpful. On the other hand, when traffic comes through your HTTPS site, your referral traffic data is saved. This means you can figure out where your traffic is actually coming from. Conclusion By now, you should have an idea of whether you should migrate your site to HTTPS. However, one thing is certain: In the fast-evolving SEO world, it’s better to be proactive and keep up with the changes. You can find more facts and data in the full research.

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars APPS Google’s Allo combines artists with neural networks to turn your selfies into stickers Paul Sawers@psawers May 11, 2017 7:08 AM Above: Allo Selfies Image Credit: Paul Sawers / VentureBeat Google is continuing to flex its machine learning muscles today with the rollout of a new auto-illustration feature within its Allo messaging app. Allo, which debuted last May ahead of its formal launch four months later, is Google’s effort to create a smart messaging app that not only connects you with your friends but also helps you plan events and find information. As with any messaging app, photos play a pivotal role in Allo’s appeal. And with the rise of selfies, Google is now allowing its users to add a little artistic flair to the mix through computer-generated drawings designed to reflect the person’s general look, with funky customization options thrown in for good measure. Above: Selfies in Allo Rather than adopting a standard computer vision approach to replicating photos by analyzing snaps on a pixel-by-pixel basis — which may not garner the best results due to varying poses and lighting conditions — Google said that its new algorithm can pick out features unique to an individual, while working alongside a team of illustrators who create drawings that represent myriad other features, such as hairstyles. Human “raters” were used to train the neural network to match the most suitable illustration with each selfie. Above: Illustration Selfies Similar to humanoids that are built to resemble humans but don’t quite make the grade, one of the core underlying issues that Google addresses with its chosen method here is the concept known as uncanny valley — basically, if the illustrations tried too hard to replicate the original picture, the resulting piece of work would likely look weird. “In the study of aesthetics, a well-known problem is the uncanny valley — the hypothesis that human replicas which appear almost, but not exactly, like real human beings can feel repulsive,” explained Jennifer Daniel, expressions creative director at Allo, in a blog post. “In machine learning, this could be compounded if you were confronted by a computer’s perception of you, versus how you may think of yourself, which can be at odds. Rather than aim to replicate a person’s appearance exactly, pursuing a lower resolution model, like emojis and stickers, allows the team to explore expressive representation by returning an image that is less about reproducing reality and more about breaking the rules of representation.” Arriving first in the Android version of Allo, with the iOS incarnation to follow, the new illustration selfies build on a growing number of recent projects that blur the lines between human creativity and machines. Last month, Google unveiled AutoDraw as an AI experiment that lets anyone create a super quick drawing based on a simple handmade doodle. The internet giant is also working on research to enable computers to generate sketches that look as though they were created by humans. Elsewhere, indie artistic app Prisma has proven popular for the way it transforms your snapshots into ultra-realistic pieces of art in seconds, using neural networks to analyze each photo and apply a style chosen by the user. The initial neural network-infused illustrations rolling out on Allo today are all about “speaking to your sarcastic side,” according to Daniel, but plans are afoot to include different styles to suit different moods or moments. “The next pack might be more cute for those sincere moments,” she said. “Then after that, maybe they’ll turn you into a dog. If emojis broadened the world of communication it’s not hard to imagine how this technology and language evolves. What will be most exciting is listening to what people say with it.”

Not only does it come down to the style of the device, but also the look and feel of the operating system. For Apple users, the obvious choice is the Apple Watch, but other options are available as well. Today it has been revealed that Samsung’s smartwatch OS, Tizen, has surpassed Google’s Android Wear, but it still falls far behind Apple’s option. Samsung Chromebook Plus According to a new report from Strategy Analytics (via Tizen Experts), during Q1 of 2017, Samsung’s Tizen OS overtook Google’s Android Wear for the first time with 19% of the overall market compared to Google’s 18%. What’s interesting to note here is that past reports predicted that Samsung’s OS would barely make a dent in the market at this point. As impressive as it is that Tizen has grabbed the number two spot, it still pales in comparison to Apple’s efforts taking a whopping 57% of the market, solely with the Apple Watch. What I found interesting about this change in the market is the availability of hardware. While Tizen only runs on Samsung proprietary devices such as the Gear S3, Gear S2, and Gear Fit devices, which are admittedly pretty great, Android Wear offers many more options. There are well over a dozen completely different Android Wear models on the market today, and many more coming later this year. Obviously, Tizen’s growth only means so much. With Apple controlling the majority of the wearable market, it feels unlikely that Tizen will overtake Apple’s watchOS or even become a stronger competitor, especially if Apple continues to limit the functionality of third-party wearables connected to the iPhone.

These devices are expected to follow the same schedule as its predecessors and launch in the 2nd half of 2018. However, it seems that this may be nothing more than speculation as Android Authority reached out to LG about the matter, only to have the company shut the rumors down. We really wouldn’t expect LG to come out and say “yeah, we’ll be making the 2018 Pixel”, so this doesn’t come as a surprise. Something else that isn’t surprising is the fact that Google is looking elsewhere to produce its future smartphones. The big G saw around 5 million Pixel and Pixel XL handsets shipped so far, but believes this number could have been higher. But with Google and HTC running into early supply constraints, this hindered the device from being more readily available. In addition to manufacturing the Pixel 3, the report claims that Google has reached out to LG with an offer to manufacture OLED displays. These displays would be used with the Pixel 2, but would also help LG combat against Samsung’s 95% mobile OLED market share. Considering the fact that LG and Google have history when it comes to phones, do you think this would be a good move? Let us know in the comments.

The Play Store adopts new app and notification icons with v7.8.16 [APK Download] Cody Toombs Follow View All Posts 2017/05/10 6:25pm PDTMay 10, 2017 110 Plus 1 on G+ 272 Share on Facebook 98 Share on Twitter Total Shares480 Applications Downloads News Google never stops changing things up. A new version of the Play Store app is rolling out to users and it comes with a new icons for the app launcher and notifications. They're simple cosmetic adjustments, but these are the types of things you can't help but notice as soon as they're on your screen. Left: Old version. Right: New version. The new app icon leaves behind the last remnants of the shopping bag icon that came along when Google still called this the Android Market. It is now just the Google Play logo with no other ornamentation. It's worth noting that the round icon variant hasn't changed, so it still looks like the Google Play logo on a dinner plate. Above: Old version. Below: New version. The notification icons have also gone through a little facelift. These also trade away the tote bag motif for the Google Play triangle, but slightly adjusted with the checkmark extending beyond the lines. The notification icons come in different colors for each of the content stores (e.g. apps, books, movies). The notification icon for stacked updates – when more than one app is installed or updated – is no longer a stack of blocks, it's just the same triangle app icon used with single installs. We're still looking for more changes in this update, but it's starting to look like this may be it. If you don't want to wait for Google to send this update out to you, grab it from the APK Mirror link below. Download The APK is signed by Google and upgrades your existing app. The cryptographic signature guarantees that the file is safe to install and was not tampered with in any way. Rather than wait for Google to push this download to your devices, which can take days, download and install it just like any other APK.

Powsniffer0110 4.0 FTW Burak Çalık they are not triangles, its the play icon. leganzish What shape is a play icon? I forget. Hachiko Google play books was perfect with Android 5 but only this one... Android 6 version is almost perfect TechGuy22 New icon every year. They are going to change play Store soon too lol Total Insecurity How do you know that? boop Unless you mean the name, the app just got another design update. sbeaulieu Isn't that the same icon from a couple of years ago? Tom Westrick We've always been at war with Eastasia Captain_Invisible Yeah.. they've used that icon on and off in promotion for a while. 4Ui812 Looks like I'll have to wait until it gets pushed. Apkmirrior won't let me download it (I don't turn off my ad blocker for anyone :-) Gjorgi Lazarovski You can download even with the adblocker on. You just need to wait like 10 sec for the download button to show up. sklatigre Can confirm Cakefish And you get to admire a cool cat. Richard Branches The play store icon on google chrome is still the old one, they should update it as well... https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/bca1aca3fd5b60e08fcd507e7c39b67f23f70ed0e4ff417bcf62881906f7106a.png Тарас Мукин Chrome apps were announced to be removed soon. Don't think they are going to bother. Richard Branches You're right about that, but they still will be available on Chrome OS so why not update it anyway?... Curt Because Google. Spazturtle Won't they be replaced in Chrome OS by Android app support? Richard Branches No, they won't... Tom Westrick If they wait long enough it'll just be back to that logo C64 Thank god / satan (choose your preference) for icon packs Konrad Krawczuk Icon packs are always kinda problem to me. If you have a few without icon from icon pack you must always fight with inconsistency. Powsniffer0110 Yes! I'm too freaking anal about this so I cannot use icon pack​s :( xyz Neither. C64 Sorry forgot the Atheist Jose Romero Google IO can't come sooner. Devin Studios Looks kinda boring compared to the old icon. Breathless So wait what happened to circles?... Cody Toombs Circles are there on the Pixel and in any other situation where the round icons are chosen. The triangle icon shows up on everything else. Anton Kuznetsov Triangles is the new circles burkett375 Since they love to A/B test, make 7 different message apps, etc....they should make 3 competing app stores/markets/hubs Ben Godfrey Don't give them any "good" ideas ;) Marcelove It doesn't matter... Google's employees are paid to keep an eye here at AP ... But it must be chimpanzees, because even with the clear feedback about stupid decisions they got here, they still don't give a f*ck and keep the screw route. Sumeet Deshmukh People who paid a lot of money to Google aren't getting these icon updates, the pixel guys mattcoz Because our icons already dropped the shopping bag, no need for an update. Sumeet Deshmukh I was a little sarcastical, I love my pixel (styled rom on my Nexus 5 (not x) Victor Stuber ya, but we got crappy white circles around all our icons. It sucks Leon I like my circles personally. sklatigre Gonna miss the shopping bag notification, kinda liked it. global etest You can keep it easily by icon packs.. sklatigre Didn't know icon packs can change the notification icons also. Margaritas Ante Porcos Google is a mess in everything. Mr. DICKHEAD it was always a mess.. Berkay Anyone else dislike both the circled icon and just the icon by itself? I prefer the shopping bag... It looks the best IMO. Thomas I loved the Android Market icon. Made so much sense SavageJeep What is Android Market? /s Salis Before Google Play branding, the app store used to he simply called Android Market. NooSH it looks like crap and i'm glad they are getting rid of it. Berkay So you prefer a simple triangle over a shopping bag? It looks horrible lol. TheDrunkenClam Completely agree. Google's whole ad campaign about Android was "be together, not the same". And then they make literally all of their icons the same by putting them in boring white circles. All in an effort to copy apple. I love the different sized and shaped icons of Android. Not a good look, Google. Jesse Kawell Once you see that notification icon "checkmark" ✅ as a 3D post lying down at an angle, you can never unsee it. BoFiS Aww, that's sad, and almost unrecognizable now since I still call mine "Market" on my homescreen... Branko Proof that Google lost the plot. reCoded So, the circle icon is the same I guess? Martin Let me read the article for you: "It's worth noting that the round icon variant hasn't changed, so it still looks like the Google Play logo on a dinner plate." Anton Kuznetsov This localization of 'update all' button text is awful https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/57e6791db8965bf1e13f4f50e3b6b5b303644e9c3f1660799bf9896ed1ef57b3.png Exalm ОМГ. Это именно в новой версии вот так? Captain_Invisible That's your crazy language's fault. Vitias R. No it's not. Have a nice day. thunderqus Only if I can find what you are talking about in English and posting screen in "who knows which" language. Vitias R. It says "Update your apps right today". I think that "Обновить все" is enough. Konrad Krawczuk Why it is not something like "обновить все" ? YuCMi Jesus christ Google. What sin did the previous icon commit? Was it too old for you guys? Grey Very ugly and hard to understand. Not intuitive at all. But I guess that's Google 2017! Lawstorant Looks generic af. Really Google? WTF? Maybe just go back to HOLO then? DragoCubed The new icon is nice but the icon in the notification bar isn't so nice. The one thing I don't like about losing the bag is the icon not representing a store. xyz OMG! TRIANGLE! NO CIRCLE? Like if you don't give a flying F about icon shapes. LOL I want circle, niggа! LOL New icon! Fuсk YEAH! Paul Teale Not circular then, not really following their own guidelines are they Kieron Quinn The round icon is round, the non-round icon is not. They're following their guidelines just fine Erimaru What about round icon? Curt I actually like this icon the most. Martin Spierings I already got complaints from people that didn't identify the play store or play icon with app store. So how the hell would this help people? They should realize that most people don't understand the connection google is looking for. Play is used for movies/film or games, not apps. The bag-background at least gave some indication on what to expect. The new one will get lots of people (those not really experienced with Android or mobile in general) to get their apps from there. These things should be self explanatory. And Google should drop the Play name (plus icon). Its a stupid name already. avnow well I used to get this icon pack, not exactly but close to this with an icon pack, this icon looks crisp! //moumon Meh.. I'm still using Elta icon pack :v That's one of the reason why I love android... Customize to meet your expectations <3 jcopernicus Awesome. A play button for purchases! Makes sense! Ra1nb0wD4sh DE Press Start to shut down Windows. :D (Not relevant anymore, I know) Ruben Tavano On the lateral menu the apps section was in the old green and with this update it has been updated to match the new green of the whole play store Alexander Reddicks The icon has been updated to support the new "adaptive" icon style being showcased next week. https://developer.android.com/preview/features/adaptive-icons.html Mr. DICKHEAD This is dumb theres nothing new I like the bodybag version.. but the naked one alone? seriously..?! David Onter The new icon looks HUGE next to the others. It doesn't seem to follow the spacing guidelines? Marcelove Google' employee : "Let's change an icon the people are used to and know for many years to something that doesn't improve anything." Google's executives : "Genius!” Biga173rd They can't make up their minds. madmaglio Finally. I've been replacing the bag icon with my own version of this for years. so much cleaner. VirtualWave I kinda hate it, it looks overly large and gaudy. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/d5821ea6199d4b4d1b5b7fa7fb41a252ab810c809090eb00f133b88f741b1735.png Follow Android Police 1.49M 468k 143k 115k Latest Deals 4 [Deal Alert] Get the LG Urbane 2nd Edition for $171.99 on eBay 2017/05/11 8:04pm PDTMay 11, 2017 4 [Deal Alert] Get 10,000 Amazon Appstore coins for $65 ($35 off) through May 25th 2017/05/11 1:34pm PDTMay 11, 2017 27 T-Mobile to offer 'buy one, get one' deal on Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus starting tomorrow (May 12th) 2017/05/11 12:52pm PDTMay 11, 2017 7 [Deal Alert] Huawei Watch in Jewel/Pearl $220 at Amazon ($330 off) 2017/05/10 7:32pm PDTMay 10, 2017 30 [Update: Deal ended] [Featured Deal Alert] Caseology is offering its new cases for the Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus to Android Police for as little as $5.99 for a limited time [Sponsored] 2017/05/10 2:39pm PDTMay 10, 2017 Latest Poll Do you use a screen protector on your phone?

However, unless you live in the middle of nowhere, there are likely to be concerts, gigs, exhibitions, and events happening this weekend close to where you live. You just need to know where to look… Google Search Lists Local Events Google now lists local events happening in your area in the near future. All you need to do to access the information is type “events near me” into Google Search. You’ll then get shown a list of events happening in your vicinity, with the option to zero in on what interests you. You can also narrow your search to a particular type of event or location. So, as Google demonstrates in the tweet embedded below, searching for “jazz concerts in Austin” will surface all jazz concerts happening in Austin in the next few weeks. From yoga to live music to art, now you can easily find and explore events happening in your area right on Search ? https://t.co/5h0LIs3P6d pic.twitter.com/0ZuI5R4hlb — Google (@Google) May 10, 2017 Google lists all of the relevant information about each event, including the date, the time, and the location.

This feature is currently only available in the United States. Google is using data provided by a range of sites including Ticketmaster, Meetup, LiveNation, StubHub, and Eventful.

technology and scale its team, sourcing talent heavily from the Philadelphia region News provided by Sidecar 11 May, 2017, 08:45 ET Share this article PHILADELPHIA, May 11, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Sidecar has completed a Series C round of equity and debt financing totaling $11 million. New investor Harbert Growth Partners (HGP) joined previous investors Ascent Venture Partners and Osage Venture Partners to lead the round. Also participating was The Yard Ventures, a Harvard alumni venture fund. Silicon Valley Bank provided the debt financing. This Series C round brings Sidecar's total financing to $26 million in less than three years. It also marks HGP's first investment in a Philadelphia-based company. Sidecar will use the funds to further develop its technology solutions—Sidecar for Google Shopping, Sidecar for Facebook Dynamic Ads, and Sidecar for Bing Shopping—to meet retailers' evolving marketing needs. The SaaS company will increase headcount by 40% by the end of 2017 to support product development and market expansion. It will draw heavily from the Philadelphia area, emphasizing growth of its engineering and data science teams, as well as its customer success, partnership, sales, and marketing teams. Guided by founder and CEO Andre Golsorkhi, Sidecar has emerged as a key tool in retailers' e-commerce marketing stacks. Based on advanced machine learning and deep data science expertise, Sidecar's technology powers shopping campaigns on Google, Facebook, and Bing, and is scalable to meet the demands of emerging channels. Since Sidecar's $8 million Series B financing 18 months ago, it has more than doubled the size of its customer base, which now includes Moosejaw, Vermont Teddy Bear, and others on the Internet Retailer Top 100. The company also expanded to the SMB and international markets, with organizations including wehkamp, the Netherlands' largest online retailer, adopting Sidecar. The company doubled headcount over the past year to support this growth, sourcing the majority of talent from the Philadelphia region while also establishing a U.K. team. Sidecar has developed new technology partnerships to further build out its capabilities. These combined factors led the company to triple recurring revenue year over year. "Sidecar is driving online product advertising into the future," said Tom Roberts, General Partner of Harbert Growth Partners. "The company continues to reimagine what's possible with artificial intelligence in retail, and its solutions have been validated by brand-name retailers across the U.S. and abroad. We are confident Sidecar will keep building on its established leadership position, and feel honored to be a part of its success." One of the reasons retailers and investors alike value Sidecar is the surging growth of online retail. The National Retail Federation forecasts online retail will grow 8-12% in 2017, up to three times faster than the growth of retail as a whole. This trend indicates continued opportunity to capitalize on the online product advertising market. Google remains the largest media owner in the world, attracting $79.4 billion in ad revenue in 2016. And last year marked a major tipping point in retailers' AdWords budgets: For the first time, retailers allocated more spend to Google Shopping ads than text ads (53%). "For online shopping to become the mainstay of retail, merchants and consumers need to better connect where the online shopping experience begins—the product discovery stage," said Golsorkhi. "Machine learning and artificial intelligence are poised to make this massively complex challenge much easier, enabling retailers to better understand consumer behavior and predict buying patterns, while creating relevant, enjoyable experiences for shoppers. With our continued dedication to machine learning technology, our customers, and our people, Sidecar is positioned to deliver this critical advancement to retail."

The Google Pixel 3, it is said, will be made by LG. However, LG itself as dismissed those reports as poppycock, saying that any such idea is "pure speculation". The current Google Pixel and Google Pixel XL were released at the end of 2016 and are still widely regarded as amongst the best Android phones out there. They are manufactured by HTC, which is also tipped as making the next generation models - Google Pixel 2, for want of a better name. Google Pixel and Pixel XL tips and tricks: Getting to grips with Google's phone LG was cited by a Korean news source Chosun Biz as getting the contract next though. It does have some element of believability considering LG has made Nexus handsets in the past - namely, the Nexus 4, Nexus 5 and Nexus 5X. But it's far too early for this kind of rumour to be popping up. Even if LG and Google have entered into an agreement, it will be a considerable while before either is willing to talk about it. Instead, let's look forward to the Google Pixel 2. It's not likely to be ready for public consumption until the second half of 2017 but we do have a wish list of what we'd like to see from it.

Canonical tags are easy, right? What’s the worst that could happen? Columnist Patrick Stox outlines when to use the canonical tag, as well as some common problems that occur during implementation. Patrick Stox on May 11, 2017 at 9:21 am More In an ideal world, there would only be one version of each page. Too bad the world is messy and the same content can exist at multiple locations on the same website and other websites. Years ago, a solution was adopted to help with these duplicate content issues: the “canonical link element,” better known as a “rel=canonical” or “canonical tag.” How does a canonical tag help with SEO? The canonical tag helps solve duplicate content issues by setting the preferred version of a page and passing signals such as links to the preferred version. The tag helps consolidate duplicate content caused by issues such as: HTTP and HTTPS www and non-www parameters and faceted navigation session IDs trailing slashes index/default pages alternate page versions such as m. or AMP pages or print versions Where to add a canonical Most SEOs are aware that you can use a canonical tag in the head section, such as: <link rel="canonical" href="https://example.com/" /> What you may not realize is that a canonical tag can be set in the HTTP header as well, such as: HTTP/1.1 200 OK Link: <https://example.com/>; rel="canonical" The canonical in the header can be used for any page, but the most common use case is for setting a preferred version for PDFs, as Google did when Dan Sharp hijacked Google’s SEO Starter Guide. ‘My canonical tag isn’t working’ The canonical tag is not a directive, meaning that it can be ignored. The canonical version is the version of the page that should be used in sitemaps, for instance, and having conflicting URLs in the sitemap or throughout your internal links can throw mixed signals. A canonical tag may also be ignored if the pages aren’t a close enough match. Other things can go wrong, such as copying pages and not changing the canonical tag or leaving a placeholder in the canonical like “change me” or “replace me.” You should also use absolute — not relative — path URLs in the canonical to help avoid errors. These and self-referential canonical tags can cause multiple pages to basically tell search engines they are the preferred version, which doesn’t make sense. If the page has multiple canonical tags that are different, then Google will ignore both. What will Google do if there are mixed signals such as those just mentioned? They will try to determine the best URL using various signals like the suggested canonicals, internal links and sitemap URLs, but there are other factors, too. For example, they may try to pick a shorter URL over a longer one or pick HTTPS over HTTP. Google prefers HTTPS pages over equivalent HTTP pages as canonical, except when there are conflicting signals such as the following (per the Use canonical URLs page in Google’s Search Console Help documentation): The HTTPS page has an invalid SSL certificate. The HTTPS page contains insecure dependencies. The HTTPS page is roboted (and the HTTP page is not). The HTTPS page redirects users to or through an HTTP page. The HTTPS page has a rel=”canonical” link to the HTTP page. The HTTPS page contains a noindex robots meta tag A rare case, but certainly one that can happen, is when coding errors cause the head section to end before it should. In this case, a canonical may actually be in the body content, where it isn’t respected by search engines. What’s worse is that this issue won’t be detected by most tools like Screaming Frog or Deep Crawl or even by viewing the source. Only by viewing the DOM (Document Object Model) itself — such as when using Inspect for Chrome Dev Tools — can this issue be identified. For example, take a look at Home Depot’s canonical tag in the image below, and you’ll see that the head section has ended — and much of the content that appears in the head when viewing the source is actually in the body when viewing the DOM. Canonical’s interaction with other tags A canonical tag can easily be wrong for one small thing like a spelling mistake or trailing slash, especially when in a set, like with pagination or hreflang. In these sets, having a different page indexed than what is included in the tags will cause set of pages not to consolidate as they should, such as setting the canonical on page 2 of a paginated set to URL of page 1. Noindex tags and canonicals should also not be used together. I’ve seen instances where the canonical tag seemed to be passing the noindex to the preferred version. Other uses for canonical tags Did you know canonical tags can be used across different domains? This is actually the preferred method to use when syndicating content. You should also canonicalize alternate versions of your website, such as mobile or AMP versions, back to the main. Even better, according to Google, you won’t need to change your canonical tags for the upcoming mobile-first index. Canonicals wouldn’t be needed in an ideal world While canonicals are useful for consolidating signals across multiple pages, remember that in the ideal world there is only one version. Consolidating pages with other methods like redirects is better in the long run, since you can hopefully get down to a single accessible version of a page.

Windows 10 is now running on a half-billion devices nearly two years after its release, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella disclosed Wednesday during the software maker’s annual conference for applications programmers. That figure is up from 400 million eight months ago, but far short of Microsoft’s goal of putting Windows 10 on 1 billion devices by 2018. The Redmond, Washington, company had already acknowledged it won’t reach that goal in time . Windows 10 represents a comeback for Microsoft after the colossal flop of Windows 8, whose ill-conceived designed deepened a decline in PC sales and contributed to the departure of Nadella’s predecessor, Steve Ballmer. Although it has been easing recently, the PC slump still hasn’t ended. People are increasingly connecting to digital services, checking email and performing other computing tasks on devices powered by Apple’s iOS and Google’s Android instead of Microsoft’s Windows. That’s one the prime reasons Microsoft has been eclipsed by both Apple and Google in the technology industry’s pecking order after dominating throughout the 1990s. Microsoft tried to piggyback on the trend by expanding into smartphones, but those attempts have mostly flopped. It’s the reason Microsoft cites for failing to meet its 1 billion goal in time. Its Surface tablet has done better, but even that product has hit rough patches. Microsoft blamed disappointing Surface sales for a revenue shortfall in its most recent years. As consumers have embraced smartphones, Microsoft increasingly is building its products with business and government agencies in mind, said Gartner analyst Ed Anderson. But Microsoft is still hoping to win over consumers with its digital servant, Cortana, a rival to Apple’s Siri, Google’s Assistant and Amazon’s Alexa. Earlier this week, Microsoft unveiled an internet-connected speaker featuring Cortana in a partnership with Samsung’s Harman Kardon. Microsoft also announced Wednesday that both Intel and HP plan to implant Cortana in upcoming devices, but didn’t provide any further details. Microsoft encouraged programmers Wednesday to design applications that help Cortana do whatever people might want. Both Amazon’s Echo and Google’s Home devices are striving to do the same thing.

By Liam Tung | May 11, 2017 -- 13:29 GMT (06:29 PDT) | Topic: Enterprise Software Work profiles let admins manage business apps and content on personal phones in a separate container. Image: Google Google will start encouraging more of its enterprise mobility customers to adopt Android for Work's IT-managed work profiles. In June, Google will require users to create a work profile when they enroll a BYOD Android handset with Google's G Suite enterprise mobility management (EMM) tool, Google Mobile Management. The change is targeted at users of Google's EMM as opposed to third-party tools. Work profiles allow admins to manage business apps and content on personal phones in a separate container to the user's own apps and data. Work apps are marked with a briefcase icon. The security-focused policy update will take effect on June 5 with the release of Google Apps Device Policy v7.77. The change targets customers who use Android at Work and a managed version of the Google Play app store, which hosts approved or whitelisted apps. Google appears to be ensuring that customers are simply using the security and management tools it already provides. "To ensure a BYOD policy that is end-user friendly without sacrificing corporate security, we would like to encourage Google Mobile Management customers to employ a mobile policy that keeps personal and corporate data safe," Google explains. The new work profile requirement only applies to customers that use Google Mobile Management for Android, and have enabled advanced management, which allows admins to control installed apps, and enforce password policies. Customers must also have whitelisted Android apps in the managed Play store. It also only applies to devices that are on Android 5.1 Lollipop or newer. Google launched Android for Work in 2015 to boost enterprise adoption of Android devices. Back then, despite Android's worldwide dominance, iOS still ruled in the enterprise. However, Google highlighted in December that Android had overtaken iOS in device shipments in the enterprise. Citing IDC's Worldwide Mobile Phone Tracker 2016 H1, Google said 62 percent of worldwide enterprise shipments were Android devices.

Pixabay In early 2017, Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel announced a new initiative in the city’s ongoing battle with violent crime. The most common solutions to this sort of problem involve hiring more police officers or working more closely with community members. But Emanuel declared that the Chicago Police Department would expand its use of software, enabling what is called “predictive policing,” particularly in neighborhoods on the city’s south side. The Chicago police will use data and computer analysis to identify neighborhoods that are more likely to experience violent crime, assigning additional police patrols in those areas. In addition, the software will identify individual people who are expected to become – but have yet to be – victims or perpetrators of violent crimes. Officers may even be assigned to visit those people to warn them against committing a violent crime. Any attempt to curb the alarming rate of homicides in Chicago is laudable. But the city’s new effort seems to ignore evidence, including recent research from members of our policing study team at the Human Rights Data Analysis Group, that predictive policing tools reinforce, rather than reimagine, existing police practices. Their expanded use could lead to further targeting of communities or people of color. Working with available data At its core, any predictive model or algorithm is a combination of data and a statistical process that seeks to identify patterns in the numbers. This can include looking at police data in hopes of learning about crime trends or recidivism. But a useful outcome depends not only on good mathematical analysis: It also needs good data. That’s where predictive policing often falls short. Machine-learning algorithms learn to make predictions by analyzing patterns in an initial training data set and then look for similar patterns in new data as they come in. If they learn the wrong signals from the data, the subsequent analysis will be lacking. This happened with a Google initiative called “Flu Trends,” which was launched in 2008 in hopes of using information about people’s online searches to spot disease outbreaks. Google’s systems would monitor users’ searches and identify locations where many people were researching various flu symptoms. In those places, the program would alert public health authorities that more people were about to come down with the flu. But the project failed to account for the potential for periodic changes in Google’s own search algorithm. In an early 2012 update, Google modified its search tool to suggest a diagnosis when users searched for terms like “cough” or “fever.” On its own, this change increased the number of searches for flu-related terms. But Google Flu Trends interpreted the data as predicting a flu outbreak twice as big as federal public health officials expected and far larger than what actually happened. Criminal justice data are biased The failure of the Google Flu Trends system was a result of one kind of flawed data – information biased by factors other than what was being measured. It’s much harder to identify bias in criminal justice prediction models. In part, this is because police data aren’t collected uniformly, and in part it’s because what data police track reflect longstanding institutional biases along income, race and gender lines. While police data often are described as representing “crime,” that’s not quite accurate. Crime itself is a largely hidden social phenomenon that happens anywhere a person violates a law. What are called “crime data” usually tabulate specific events that aren’t necessarily lawbreaking – like a 911 call – or that are influenced by existing police priorities, like arrests of people suspected of particular types of crime, or reports of incidents seen when patrolling a particular neighborhood. Neighborhoods with lots of police calls aren’t necessarily the same places the most crime is happening. They are, rather, where the most police attention is – though where that attention focuses can often be biased by gender and racial factors. It’s not possible to remove the bias Some researchers have argued that machine learning algorithms can address systemic biases by designing “neutral” models that don’t take into account sensitive variables like race or gender. But while it may seem possible in hypothetical situations, it doesn’t appear to be the case in real life. Our recent study, by Human Rights Data Analysis Group’s Kristian Lum and William Isaac, found that predictive policing vendor PredPol’s purportedly race-neutral algorithm targeted black neighborhoods at roughly twice the rate of white neighborhoods when trained on historical drug crime data from Oakland, California. We found similar results when analyzing the data by income group, with low-income communities targeted at disproportionately higher rates compared to high-income neighborhoods. But estimates – created from public health surveys and population models – suggest illicit drug use in Oakland is roughly equal across racial and income groups. If the algorithm were truly race-neutral, it would spread drug-fighting police attention evenly across the city. Similar evidence of racial bias was found by ProPublica’s investigative reporters when they looked at COMPAS, an algorithm predicting a person’s risk of committing a crime, used in bail and sentencing decisions in Broward County, Florida, and elsewhere around the country. These systems learn only what they are presented with; if those data are biased, their learning can’t help but be biased too. Fixing this problem is not a matter of just doing more advanced mathematical or statistical calculations. Rather, it will require rethinking how police agencies collect and analyze data, and how they train their staff to use data on the job. Understanding the biases to improve the data Using predictive analytics in the real world is challenging, particularly when trying to craft government policies to minimize harm to vulnerable populations. We do not believe that police departments should stop using analytics or data-driven approaches to reducing crime. Rather, police should work to understand the biases and limitations inherent in their data. In our view, police departments – and all agencies that use predictive algorithms – should make their systems transparent to public scrutiny. This should start with community members and police departments discussing policing priorities and measures of police performance. That way any software the police use can be programmed to reflect the community’s values and concerns. Ensuring transparency It is not enough to claim or assume an algorithm is unbiased just because it is computerized and uses data: A lack of bias must be proven by evaluating the algorithm’s performance itself. Police agencies should get independent experts or human rights groups to perform regular audits of the algorithms and the data they process. Much like the annual financial reviews large companies do, these examinations can ensure the input data are valid and are analyzed properly to avoid discrimination. If a company wants to claim its algorithm is proprietary and should be kept secret, it should still be required to offer robust testing environments so outside experts can examine its performance. Further, police departments that use algorithms to make predictions about individuals, like Chicago’s Strategic Subject List does, should have policies similar to a new European Union regulation requiring human-understandable explanations of computer algorithms’ decisions. And no agency or company should be allowed to discriminate against people who have been identified by predictive policing. Used correctly, predictive policing can be used to address the complex factors underlying crime trends. For example, rather than stepping up patrols, Toronto and other cities in Canada are using predictive modeling to connect residents to local social services. By improving the quality of data cities collect, and analyzing the information with more transparent and inclusive processes, cities can build safer communities, rather than cracking down harder on areas that are already struggling.

What does voice search mean for your local SEO strategy? Local SEO 11 May 17 | Chris Camps Facebook0 Linkedin24 Google+9 Twitter 33 The ubiquity of virtual assistants like Siri, Cortana and Alexa, together with improvements in technology, has led to an uptick in voice search queries. For businesses that rely on local search traffic, this has important ramifications for their strategy. So how can businesses ensure they aren’t left behind when it comes to local search? Produced in collaboration with Brandify. OK, Google…what’s going on with voice search? Voice search is a growing trend that has been pinging the radars of savvy search marketers for the last few years. In 2016, conversational AI company MindMeld surveyed smartphone users in the US, finding that 60% of users who used voice search had started using it in the last past year – indicating rising adoption rates. This is backed up by Mary Meeker’s 2016 Internet Trends Report, which found that Google voice search queries in 2016 are up 35x over 2008, now making up 20% of searches made with the Google Android app. It’s not hard to see why. Voice searches are fast (humans can speak at 150 words per minute, versus typing at 40 wpm), convenient (instant, hands-free) and increasingly reliable. Rising word accuracy rates are a big factor. Usage in the US grew from 30-65% between 2013-2015, with 35% citing improvements in technology as the primary reason for adopting it. In its early stages, voice recognition had an accuracy of below 80%, rendering the service buggy and difficult to use. Today, Google’s word accuracy rate is over 90%. But the real driver of widespread adoption has been the omnipresence of virtual assistants like Siri, Cortana, Google Assistant – all of whom will automatically perform a web search if they are unable to answer a question natively. SEO company HigherVisibility surveyed 2,000 mobile phone users and found that 27% of respondents use voice search assistants daily, while another 27% use them at least once a week. What does this mean for search traffic? More searches using natural language Whereas regular searches usually just include keywords (‘IHOP opening times’), voice searches tend to be structured using full, grammatically correct sentences (‘what time does IHOP open on a Sunday?’). In fact, Google is currently working to better accommodate these so-called ‘natural language’ queries. At the Google I/O developer conference last year, Google CEO Sundar Pichai revealed Google Assistant’s ability to handle follow-up questions without the need to re-state the context. This allows you to search something like “Who directed The Revenant?” followed immediately by “Show me his awards”. More searches on mobile The convenience afforded by voice search comes into its own when users are on mobile. Although available on desktop web for Google and via Siri for Mac (as of OSX Sierra), voice searches don’t make as much sense in a desktop environment. Higher Visibility found that over half (53%) of those that used voice search used it when driving, and another 21% used it when doing another activity. More searches with local intent According to Meeker’s Internet Trends Report 2016, mobile voice-related searches are 3X more likely to be local-based than text-based queries. This makes local SEO critical for businesses seeking to appear in these results.

What does it mean for your marketing strategy? Look to target long-tail and natural language keywords in content For the question-answering content on your site, consider how someone might phrase their search query as a full sentence. If you’re stuck for inspiration, your website analytics should reveal at least one or two search terms that tick this box. Creating an FAQs page is an easy way to optimize for this, as it both asks and answers the most relevant queries for customers – and puts full questions in prominent header tags. Optimize your site for mobile In October 2016, global mobile / tablet web browsing finally exceeded desktop, with the former accounting for 51.3%, and the latter 48.7% according to StatCounter. Mobile-friendliness has been a ranking signal since 2015, but it’s particularly important for businesses who receive traffic from local search from mobile users – such as searches appended with ‘near me’. Improve your local SEO to target searches with local intent Google’s Venice update in 2012 improved the triggering of Local Universal results (aka the ‘three-pack’, shown below). This box pops up when faced with queries that have relevant local results, like my Neanderthal request for “food near me”: Basic SEO advice aside, here are a few simple steps to improve your ranking in these results: Verify your Google My Business listing including a long, unique and correctly-formatted description that includes links to your business. You should also upload high-resolution photos, opening times, a phone number and a business address that matches your website. Use a consistent name, address and phone number (NAP) across your online profiles. That includes your Google My Business listing and your website. This information needs to be exact. Acquire and maintain positive reviews as these have been shown to affect your ranking in local search results.

It will draw heavily from the Philadelphia area, emphasizing growth of its engineering and data science teams, as well as its customer success, partnership, sales, and marketing teams. Guided by founder and CEO Andre Golsorkhi, Sidecar has emerged as a key tool in retailers' e-commerce marketing stacks. Based on advanced machine learning and deep data science expertise, Sidecar's technology powers shopping campaigns on Google, Facebook, and Bing, and is scalable to meet the demands of emerging channels. Since Sidecar's $8 million Series B financing 18 months ago, it has more than doubled the size of its customer base, which now includes Moosejaw, Vermont Teddy Bear, and others on the Internet Retailer Top 100. The company also expanded to the SMB and international markets, with organizations including wehkamp, the Netherlands' largest online retailer, adopting Sidecar. The company doubled headcount over the past year to support this growth, sourcing the majority of talent from the Philadelphia region while also establishing a U.K. team. Sidecar has developed new technology partnerships to further build out its capabilities. These combined factors led the company to triple recurring revenue year over year. "Sidecar is driving online product advertising into the future," said Tom Roberts, General Partner of Harbert Growth Partners. "The company continues to reimagine what's possible with artificial intelligence in retail, and its solutions have been validated by brand-name retailers across the U.S. and abroad. We are confident Sidecar will keep building on its established leadership position, and feel honored to be a part of its success." One of the reasons retailers and investors alike value Sidecar is the surging growth of online retail. The National Retail Federation forecasts online retail will grow 8-12% in 2017, up to three times faster than the growth of retail as a whole. This trend indicates continued opportunity to capitalize on the online product advertising market. Google remains the largest media owner in the world, attracting $79.4 billion in ad revenue in 2016. And last year marked a major tipping point in retailers' AdWords budgets: For the first time, retailers allocated more spend to Google Shopping ads than text ads (53%). "For online shopping to become the mainstay of retail, merchants and consumers need to better connect where the online shopping experience begins—the product discovery stage," said Golsorkhi. "Machine learning and artificial intelligence are poised to make this massively complex challenge much easier, enabling retailers to better understand consumer behavior and predict buying patterns, while creating relevant, enjoyable experiences for shoppers. With our continued dedication to machine learning technology, our customers, and our people, Sidecar is positioned to deliver this critical advancement to retail."

The Play Store adopts new app and notification icons with v7.8.16 [APK Download] Cody Toombs Follow View All Posts 2017/05/10 6:25pm PDTMay 10, 2017 110 Plus 1 on G+ 272 Share on Facebook 98 Share on Twitter Total Shares480 Applications Downloads News Google never stops changing things up. A new version of the Play Store app is rolling out to users and it comes with a new icons for the app launcher and notifications. They're simple cosmetic adjustments, but these are the types of things you can't help but notice as soon as they're on your screen. Left: Old version. Right: New version. The new app icon leaves behind the last remnants of the shopping bag icon that came along when Google still called this the Android Market. It is now just the Google Play logo with no other ornamentation. It's worth noting that the round icon variant hasn't changed, so it still looks like the Google Play logo on a dinner plate. Above: Old version. Below: New version. The notification icons have also gone through a little facelift. These also trade away the tote bag motif for the Google Play triangle, but slightly adjusted with the checkmark extending beyond the lines. The notification icons come in different colors for each of the content stores (e.g. apps, books, movies). The notification icon for stacked updates – when more than one app is installed or updated – is no longer a stack of blocks, it's just the same triangle app icon used with single installs. We're still looking for more changes in this update, but it's starting to look like this may be it. If you don't want to wait for Google to send this update out to you, grab it from the APK Mirror link below. Download The APK is signed by Google and upgrades your existing app. The cryptographic signature guarantees that the file is safe to install and was not tampered with in any way. Rather than wait for Google to push this download to your devices, which can take days, download and install it just like any other APK.

They 'quickly' portray even to a naive what kind of app you will be clicking on, especially amid numerous numbers of apps. Marcelove .Google' employee : "Let's change an icon the people are used to and know for many years to something that doesn't improve anything." Google's executives : "Genius!” . Powsniffer0110 4.0 FTW Burak Çalık they are not triangles, its the play icon. leganzish What shape is a play icon? I forget. Hachiko Google play books was perfect with Android 5 but only this one... Android 6 version is almost perfect TechGuy22 New icon every year. They are going to change play Store soon too lol Total Insecurity How do you know that? boop Unless you mean the name, the app just got another design update. sbeaulieu Isn't that the same icon from a couple of years ago? Tom Westrick We've always been at war with Eastasia Captain_Invisible Yeah.. they've used that icon on and off in promotion for a while. 4Ui812 Looks like I'll have to wait until it gets pushed. Apkmirrior won't let me download it (I don't turn off my ad blocker for anyone :-) Gjorgi Lazarovski You can download even with the adblocker on. You just need to wait like 10 sec for the download button to show up. sklatigre Can confirm Cakefish And you get to admire a cool cat. Richard Branches The play store icon on google chrome is still the old one, they should update it as well... https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/bca1aca3fd5b60e08fcd507e7c39b67f23f70ed0e4ff417bcf62881906f7106a.png Тарас Мукин Chrome apps were announced to be removed soon. Don't think they are going to bother. Richard Branches You're right about that, but they still will be available on Chrome OS so why not update it anyway?... Curt Because Google. Spazturtle Won't they be replaced in Chrome OS by Android app support? Richard Branches No, they won't... Tom Westrick If they wait long enough it'll just be back to that logo C64 Thank god / satan (choose your preference) for icon packs Konrad Krawczuk Icon packs are always kinda problem to me. If you have a few without icon from icon pack you must always fight with inconsistency. Powsniffer0110 Yes! I'm too freaking anal about this so I cannot use icon pack​s :( xyz Neither. C64 Sorry forgot the Atheist Jose Romero Google IO can't come sooner. Devin Studios Looks kinda boring compared to the old icon. Breathless So wait what happened to circles?... Cody Toombs Circles are there on the Pixel and in any other situation where the round icons are chosen. The triangle icon shows up on everything else. Anton Kuznetsov Triangles is the new circles burkett375 Since they love to A/B test, make 7 different message apps, etc....they should make 3 competing app stores/markets/hubs Ben Godfrey Don't give them any "good" ideas ;) Marcelove It doesn't matter... Google's employees are paid to keep an eye here at AP ... But it must be chimpanzees, because even with the clear feedback about stupid decisions they got here, they still don't give a f*ck and keep the screw route. Sumeet Deshmukh People who paid a lot of money to Google aren't getting these icon updates, the pixel guys mattcoz Because our icons already dropped the shopping bag, no need for an update. Sumeet Deshmukh I was a little sarcastical, I love my pixel (styled rom on my Nexus 5 (not x) Victor Stuber ya, but we got crappy white circles around all our icons. It sucks Leon I like my circles personally. sklatigre Gonna miss the shopping bag notification, kinda liked it. global etest You can keep it easily by icon packs.. sklatigre Didn't know icon packs can change the notification icons also. Margaritas Ante Porcos Google is a mess in everything. Mr. DICKHEAD it was always a mess.. Berkay Anyone else dislike both the circled icon and just the icon by itself? I prefer the shopping bag... It looks the best IMO. Thomas I loved the Android Market icon. Made so much sense SavageJeep What is Android Market? /s Salis Before Google Play branding, the app store used to he simply called Android Market. NooSH it looks like crap and i'm glad they are getting rid of it. Berkay So you prefer a simple triangle over a shopping bag? It looks horrible lol. TheDrunkenClam Completely agree. Google's whole ad campaign about Android was "be together, not the same". And then they make literally all of their icons the same by putting them in boring white circles. All in an effort to copy apple. I love the different sized and shaped icons of Android. Not a good look, Google. Jesse Kawell Once you see that notification icon "checkmark" ✅ as a 3D post lying down at an angle, you can never unsee it. BoFiS Aww, that's sad, and almost unrecognizable now since I still call mine "Market" on my homescreen... Branko Proof that Google lost the plot. reCoded So, the circle icon is the same I guess? Martin Let me read the article for you: "It's worth noting that the round icon variant hasn't changed, so it still looks like the Google Play logo on a dinner plate." Anton Kuznetsov This localization of 'update all' button text is awful https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/57e6791db8965bf1e13f4f50e3b6b5b303644e9c3f1660799bf9896ed1ef57b3.png Exalm ОМГ. Это именно в новой версии вот так? Captain_Invisible That's your crazy language's fault. Vitias R. No it's not. Have a nice day. thunderqus Only if I can find what you are talking about in English and posting screen in "who knows which" language. Vitias R. It says "Update your apps right today". I think that "Обновить все" is enough. Konrad Krawczuk Why it is not something like "обновить все" ? YuCMi Jesus christ Google. What sin did the previous icon commit? Was it too old for you guys? Grey Very ugly and hard to understand. Not intuitive at all. But I guess that's Google 2017! Lawstorant Looks generic af. Really Google? WTF? Maybe just go back to HOLO then? DragoCubed The new icon is nice but the icon in the notification bar isn't so nice. The one thing I don't like about losing the bag is the icon not representing a store. xyz OMG! TRIANGLE! NO CIRCLE? Like if you don't give a flying F about icon shapes. LOL I want circle, niggа! LOL New icon! Fuсk YEAH! Paul Teale Not circular then, not really following their own guidelines are they Kieron Quinn The round icon is round, the non-round icon is not. They're following their guidelines just fine Erimaru What about round icon? Curt I actually like this icon the most. Martin Spierings I already got complaints from people that didn't identify the play store or play icon with app store. So how the hell would this help people? They should realize that most people don't understand the connection google is looking for. Play is used for movies/film or games, not apps. The bag-background at least gave some indication on what to expect. The new one will get lots of people (those not really experienced with Android or mobile in general) to get their apps from there. These things should be self explanatory. And Google should drop the Play name (plus icon). Its a stupid name already. avnow well I used to get this icon pack, not exactly but close to this with an icon pack, this icon looks crisp! //moumon Meh.. I'm still using Elta icon pack :v That's one of the reason why I love android... Customize to meet your expectations <3 jcopernicus Awesome. A play button for purchases! Makes sense! Ra1nb0wD4sh DE Press Start to shut down Windows. :D (Not relevant anymore, I know) Ruben Tavano On the lateral menu the apps section was in the old green and with this update it has been updated to match the new green of the whole play store Alexander Reddicks The icon has been updated to support the new "adaptive" icon style being showcased next week. https://developer.android.com/preview/features/adaptive-icons.html Mr. DICKHEAD This is dumb theres nothing new I like the bodybag version.. but the naked one alone? seriously..?! David Onter The new icon looks HUGE next to the others. It doesn't seem to follow the spacing guidelines? Marcelove Google' employee : "Let's change an icon the people are used to and know for many years to something that doesn't improve anything." Google's executives : "Genius!” Biga173rd They can't make up their minds. madmaglio Finally. I've been replacing the bag icon with my own version of this for years. so much cleaner. VirtualWave I kinda hate it, it looks overly large and gaudy. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/d5821ea6199d4b4d1b5b7fa7fb41a252ab810c809090eb00f133b88f741b1735.png Follow Android Police 1.49M 468k 143k 115k Latest Deals 4 [Deal Alert] Get the LG Urbane 2nd Edition for $171.99 on eBay 2017/05/11 8:04pm PDTMay 11, 2017 4 [Deal Alert] Get 10,000 Amazon Appstore coins for $65 ($35 off) through May 25th 2017/05/11 1:34pm PDTMay 11, 2017 27 T-Mobile to offer 'buy one, get one' deal on Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus starting tomorrow (May 12th) 2017/05/11 12:52pm PDTMay 11, 2017 7 [Deal Alert] Huawei Watch in Jewel/Pearl $220 at Amazon ($330 off) 2017/05/10 7:32pm PDTMay 10, 2017 30 [Update: Deal ended] [Featured Deal Alert] Caseology is offering its new cases for the Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus to Android Police for as little as $5.99 for a limited time [Sponsored] 2017/05/10 2:39pm PDTMay 10, 2017 Latest Poll Do you use a screen protector on your phone?

The speakers didn't go into detail on all the apps and services that Home would work with, preferring instead to focus on a few specific demos. Now, Google has published a list of everything that works with Home, and we expect this will grow over time. Here's what Google has published so far on its support site for Home.

Like in Amazon Echo we just have to say "Alexa". David Hyman Microsoft just recently changed the Xbox commands from Xbox to Cortona. Not only is it worse than before but I constantly say the old keyword. The thing with ok google is that it never really comes up during a normal conversation where as Siri and Alexa sound more like other names and leaves to false keyword activation XerBlade Having "Xbox" as the hotword was pretty much the dumbest idea they could've possibly had. Unless you are a lonely warrior who only plays video games by himself all the time (as game developers seem to think all gamers are these days since hardly anyone who isn't Nintendo builds local multiplayer anymore...), it is extremely likely that the word "Xbox" is going to come up in normal conversation extremely often while you are using the Xbox with your friends or family. In fact, I know from experience that it happens constantly. David Hyman True but my point was about the issues with changing hotwords, and the fact that Cortona is worse than what they had before Jarrett Lennon Kaufman In what way is it worse? "Hey Cortana" works pretty well for me on my computer and Xbox with NO false positives like before. trickinit It doesn't work very well for me. It's a lot slower to respond and it tends to get the command wrong a lot more than it used to with "Xbox". Anytime Cortana doesn't understand me, it switches to the browser to do a Bing search. That get pretty frustrating when I'm trying to record a game clip. David Hyman Yea! Try having Cortona try to find a TV show, that used to be solid with the old way and completely fails now Jarrett Lennon Kaufman That doesn't sound like a problem with the command, necessarily, but the software change overall. David Hyman It seems like it always has to phone home for even the simplest commands like turn off. It seems to fail to understand that command very often lzdking I keep switching back to Cortona after system updates because I really want to use it, but the lag time is too much. Very annoying to tell Cortona to pause a show and then have it take anywhere from 3 - 8 seconds to pause. I switched back to the Xbox commands because they are nearly instant. David Hyman Dude that's definitely a major issue. I keep using it so they get more data to hopefully improve it. I like the media capabilities of my Xbox more than Chromecast because I get hdmi pass through for my Comcast box and it has Amazon video. Two things that I can't get with a Chromecast XerBlade I wasn't going to correct you if you only said it once, but it's "Cortana." David Hyman Oh sorry auto correct Jarrett Lennon Kaufman That would be terrible. The word "Google" comes up a lot in conversation in 2016. No way I'd want that alone to be the keyword in my living room. Damodara Kovie [dkovie] It's 'Ok Google'. Do you really say those two words together outside of voice recognition interactions? Jarrett Lennon Kaufman Did you bother to read the comment I was replying to? Damodara Kovie [dkovie] I feel a fool. My apologies, good sir. enoch861 At least those sound much much better than Ok, Google. catalysto Yes, "Alexa" is very easy to say and makes it feel like I'm talking to an actual person. "OK, Google" is awkward and alienating, at best. Matt Cortana is probably the best name actually. It's easy to say and is different enough that you shouldn't get a lot of false positives. I imagine Alexa could get annoying in households where someone is named Alexa, Alexis, possibly even Alex. wjrandon I'm tired of saying "ok google" as well. Marko Šaric Yeah. I wish that could be changed. At least "Hey Google!", as was shown at Google io. Lateef Alabi-Oki You can use "Hey Google" also. XerBlade At which point tech podcasters everywhere will have to find a new substitute phrase to use when they want to talk about it without activating the devices of everyone listening en masse. Lateef Alabi-Oki Hopefully, the voice training technology improves in these devices so that only registered voices can trigger the hotword. blassster And they need to tie the person's registered voice and query to the proper Google account. Custom hotwords per user would help. Lateef Alabi-Oki I believe Dieter Bohn said they were working on that in today's Verge podcast. If true, that'd be really neat. blassster I've never had this problem after they rolled out the training model part of the setup so long ago. XerBlade I never had that problem until they did that. Actually, they rolled out the training part of the setup alongside the "OK Google everywhere" feature. Neither existed before the other. So I highly doubt very many people had the issue BEFORE they rolled out the training model part of the setup, because they would literally have to be sitting either on the Google Now screen or (in the case of Nexus devices only at the time) on the home screen at the time when the hotword was heard, the chances of which are kinda low. blassster Oh, I thought the training model came later. I remember after training it (or, probably re-training it if you are correct) that it was solved. Early on for me it was the worst! youareme7 really? that's a Home thing I missed? I mean I want custom but at least hey google rolls off a little easier than ok google. Lateef Alabi-Oki I doubt they'd make it customizable since "Ok, Google" is free marketing and brand awareness for them. youareme7 Yeah, don't disagree but still a bummer, that syllable salad is a minor annoyance Lateef Alabi-Oki Yeah, I can see how it may be difficult to pronounce for non-English speakers. Maison Pulaski I doubt they would change the name of their flagship phone because _Nexus_ is free.... Oh wait.... Nevermind. Lateef Alabi-Oki You're right. This is Google we're talking about. We might wake up tomorrow and the hotword would be "Hey, Giri". By the way they're going to change the name of the Google Cast app to Google Home. Not confusing at all. Arthur J. hey google doesn't work Tuck Choate You don't have a Google home to test it on, yet, do you? Arthur J. I was speaking about Nexus Tuck Choate This discussion is about Google home. Arthur J. yeah, but why the command would be this on a device and that on another Tuck Choate It's primarily a voice device. AP even did an article on an APK breakdown on how they might give more control to users for voice actions. http://www.androidpolice.com/2016/08/19/google-app-v6-3-suggests-google-assistant-may-launch-limited-language-support-expands-user-defined-actions-apk-teardown/ Arthur J. Forgot that one, that would so nice if they expand it to all devices. As Youareme7 said, 'OK' an extra syllable and "hey" would be more discreet. Especially when you say in English US in a non english country Jarrett Lennon Kaufman Yes, but more syllables was purposeful. More syllables makes it easier for the software to understand and gives you fewer false positives. Ryan Hey google works, I have one. Its not as reliable as OK google though. Lateef Alabi-Oki I believe "Hey, Google" worked in the demos. I may be wrong though, but I thought it did. Arthur J. I didn't payed attention to that Matt It just worked on my phone. 6p YaKillaCJ Just worked on my watch too. Hey Google is a lot more natural than ok Google. Still should be able to name your device. It's only natural since U can nickname/hotkey people. That way my Phone, Remote (older phone), Tablet, Watch, and now Home doesn't go off at once. drksilenc It does work i use it at home all the time. It doesnt work from cell phone which is done on purpose so you dont get multiple google devices activating at the same time. Justin W Hey Google works for me with my phone. Not sure if it's me just not saying it clearly enough or if it's actually a supported hotword though. Marko Šaric Works for me too (just tried it out). On my g watch and Nexus 5x. Cool. Markus Ressel Still kind of awkward imo dhamp2g Pretty silly reason to me, but to each his own. Marko Šaric Will Google Home work in Europe? (By Europe I mean Croatia). Lateef Alabi-Oki No, because the EU will find an excuse to sanction them for another monopoly abuse claim. Marko Šaric Seriously though. I was thinking about getting one. But I would like to know if I could actually use the thing and not just admire it. Lateef Alabi-Oki I think it's US only for now. It might come to Europe next year. They probably want to get multilingual issues sorted out first before they introduce it in Europe. Marko Šaric That's a bit disappointing if true. I would use it in English anyway. Lars Jeppesen Of course it will work if you import it. I'm planning to.. Marko Šaric I'm planning to also. However, I would like to not pay 3 times the price after shipping and taxes. Any tips for import sites where you may have purchased items previously. I've never imported from the states, as I merely use Amazon.de or UK. Lars Jeppesen Why would you think that? You think it checks your location and refuses to work if outside the US? Lateef Alabi-Oki Nope. I'm just speculating. I could competely wrong. Gregory It might not be sold in Europe, but will it work in Europe? I also don't mind using it in English. Matt I want to know this too. I might get my US friend to bring one with him in December to the UK, if it's going to work that is. Lateef Alabi-Oki If Google Assistant works in Europe, and I believe it does, I see no reason why Google Home wouldn't. I doubt Google would deliberately region lock Home. Jens Törnblad It doesn't work with Android TV? RedPandaAlex I'm pretty sure they confirmed that it will worth with Android TV using the Google Cast feature. Lateef Alabi-Oki It works with any Google Cast enabled device, including Android TV. Christofftofferson I assumed it would as android tv is a Chromecast receiver. komal You have a nice post and i liked very much http://www.printablecalendar2017.us/2016/07/march-2017-calendar.html XerBlade It will cast to an Android TV device, yes, but you can't use it (yet) to control the Android TV interface with voice commands like you can with one of the Android TV voice remotes. So it's kinda halfway supported. 2×4 Missing: - 8tracks? - TP-Link Kasa? - Ecobee? Lazy Tango All my standing lights are connected through TP-Link Kasa... Partially because Alexa connects to it, but mostly because I can't afford Hue lights. 2×4 in my case, I use Kasa because solutions that require a hub haven't worked reliably enough for me. CUEBALL Same here. Hope Kasa integrates with Home in the near future. Kevin Sauer No Ecobee? No Caseta Wireless Lutron? The smarthome space is so annoying right now. "Buy this thing! It may work with some other stuff. I dunno. Good luck." wjrandon "Ok Google, start the Rooma"? Kevin Sauer Sure that sounds good Philip Worthington Maybe, although I suspect what you got would be closer to this... https://youtu.be/g8v6cZ21vlc thomasguide2 Shouldn't the roomba be starting by itself? Phoenix I see what you did there Fatty Bunter You can do this with a Harmony Hub and IFTTT right now by issuing the appropriate IR command for a given voice keyword. Obviously that requires more $, but hey it's possible. enoch861 This is why you just buy the Echo. It works with mostly everything. catalysto Yeah, except the Amazon ecosystem is nowhere near as robust as Google's (e.g., Calendar, Maps, et cetera). Amazon has the upper hand on hardware integration at the moment, but I have no doubt that Google will quickly catch up -- especially with this fairly impressive launch list (remember Echo launched with none). Matt Maps "Ok Google, Navigate to the store." "You're in your house dumbfuck, but here's a map to the store on your TV." catalysto So... What exactly is your point? You know Alexa doesn't have this information, right? Cory S it actually can do all those things. Albeit badly, but it does. cabbieBot best comment on AP possibly ever. Brandon V. Fletcher Echo's support grew over time. So will Google Home's. Hector Diaz I have 3 echo so with Smartthings. Really like it but echo is not that smart. shadowdude777 It really bugs me that Play Music doesn't work with the Echo. And this is ALL GOOGLE'S FAULT. If they would just expose an API like Spotify does, we could have support for Play Music everywhere that we have Spotify. I'd ditch Play Music today, because Spotify has a better desktop client, better social features, an app that isn't a lagfest, and better family pricing now, but I'd lose out on Play Music's ability to upload my own tracks, which is sadly quite important to me. :( Cory S Amazon blocks Chromecast products from even being sold on their store, and you think they would work well with Google on this? BRB I need to get back to watch Prime video on my TV....oh wait its Android TV and I cant because actively AMAZON BLOCKS IT. shadowdude777 Amazon doesn't have to do ANYTHING if Google didn't provide such a bad service with a locked-down API; that's the point. If there were a Play Music API, a third-party dev could write the Echo Skill that integrates with it, with no work on Amazon's part. All of these walled gardens are infuriating; Google needs to learn to play nice with other ecosystems. It would solve a lot of their problems if they just made it possible to integrate their services with other systems. Andy J Did you really just suggest that Google doesn't open up everything they can for developers? You have seen https://developers.google.com/apis-explorer/#p/ right? shadowdude777 You're joking, right? Are you really defending them and saying that "they're doing the best they can"? If they were opening up everything they can for developers, why is there no music API? Spotify has one. Why is there no Hangouts API? Why is there no Allo API? These are all services that NEED APIs to be taken seriously. Give me one good reason why they can't expose an API for these services. Andy J OK - well..... Hangouts & Allo = proprietary, just like WhatsApp doesn't have an API, Facebook messenger doesn't have an API. The music service doesn't have an API for any number of reasons ranging from - they don't want to expose the service via an API to - the contracts they have agreed with the studios and labels may well disallow it, don't make the mistake that all the music services have identical agreements with the labels because that is far from the case. Finally - don't fall in to the trap that every service under the sun should/does have an API - Netflix doesn't provide an API allowing you to consume their paid for content outside of the Netflix ecosystem. Amazon TV doesn't have an API allowing you to consume their video content outside of their service. shadowdude777 Google Talk used standards (XMPP) while Hangouts doesn't, and Allo doesn't. Yes, other walled gardens also don't provide APIs, but you shouldn't pretend that Google is some bastion of developer/consumer-friendliness when they're just as bad as every other company that thinks they're above playing nice with others. Slack has an API, Discord has an API, Telegram has an API etc. There's no way that Google was able to negotiate an agreement allowing for a feature like users uploading their own songs to Play Music, but not negotiate an agreement allowing for API access for premium members like Spotify has. This is a decision they made, considering they obviously have the pull to make an API happen if they actually cared. Yes, video streaming services don't provide APIs, and I'm not asking for Google to open up a Play Movies streaming API. But Play Music has no reason not to have one, nor do Google's multiple failing messenger apps. Andy J "Yes, video streaming services don't provide APIs, and I'm not asking for Google to open up a Play Movies streaming API." This is my point - why? Why aren't you asking for that? Your entire argument is that Google don't have enough APIs - why stop at demanding Play Music? I'm not saying Google should not open up an Play Music API - there is obviously something because there are unofficial apps that use an undocumented API - but why do you think it would be OK to not open up a video streaming API too - after all - YouTube has one, why shouldn't Play Movies - especially considering it uses YouTube on the backend anyway. Josh Hoffman How is the Spotify family pricing better than Google All Access? Play music 6 users for 14.99 plus Youtube Red. Spotify is 14.99 for 6 users but spotify only. shadowdude777 Didn't realize it was you + 5 people for Play Music, I thought it was 5 people total (so you + 4 people). Yeah, I guess GPM's pricing is better. Pranav Check IFTTT, they have a lot of connections that solve this issue Savage Alien Ecobee commands are HomeKit based. atlharry Not just HomeKit. Smartthings works as well so you could get to the Ecobee through Smartthings. Savage Alien Oh, okay. Thanks for clarifying that. youareme7 These are just the launch (pre-launch?) partners, it'll expand exponentially when they open it up in December. I use Wink for instance and I know they're working on it but weren't a "launch partner". dhamp2g They have some big ones on the list. It works with chrome cast, text , and Play music.....I'm in Lars Jeppesen Never heard of those products.... Ryan IFTTT gives you control over all of that. The setup kind of sucks, Ill admit, but the plus side you can customize the phrases that trigger things to something that is more "human" or fun. Kevin Sauer Thanks for your reply. I have already done all of that through IFTTT, but as you point out, it's a pain in the ass. I would prefer the manufacturers bake it into their product directly. YaKillaCJ @Ryan I did the same here. I just setup a lot using IFTTT, Pushbullet & Tasker. Sure U have to manually make the word commands but it works. Nothing like saying "Hey Google" and control nearly everything. Ryan Yeah, its definitely tedious. But odds are I will keep doing it after makers like Wemo and Lutron plug in because, what I have seen so far with 3rd party services, their actions are really limited. While I had to set it up its nice to be able to say "Hey Google, start a fire" to have it turn on my fireplace instead of something more literal. BAlGaInTl I paired mine with a Samsung SmartThings hub that was on sale for $50. I can control my Ecobee seamlessly through that. I don't think there is Lutron support yet though. MicroNix This is why Echo > Google Home right now and probably for some time. Android sites are hyping Google Home like its some great thing. It barely works with anything in a smart home right now. Let's revisit in a year or so. Until then, umm, no thanks. Ethan Campbell I'm interested in the Software. I was a Quora power user, and I'm on hiatus right now. When I return, I will be using the Google Home with it all the time. Gregg Long I hope Caseta comes through soon. A much better solution for lights that aren't table lamps. Gregg Long Yes much better - and they still offer a wall wart plug in for table lamps. And unlike solutions like Hue, you can use a caseta wall switch which works with regular decora plates to turn on and off the lights while still having retaining control through your app. With Wifi lights, when you turn them off at the switch your remote control turns off with them. eazyean1 Sonos? Lateef Alabi-Oki If you can connect the Audio Chromecast to Sonos, it might be able to work. I don't have a Sonos, but I heard someone talk about it on an IOT podcast yesterday. Christofftofferson Most of the sonos speakers don't have audio in jacks (only the play 5 does). Sonos does accept google cast from Google play if you have sonos on the android phone you're casting from. Also they annouced they're working with Alexa to get voice control in 2017... so hopefully they remain fairly agnostic between Google, Amazon and others. Lateef Alabi-Oki Honestly, I see no reason why Sonos can't write some actions for Google Assistant and Google Home. They'd be foolish not to, since it looks like Google wants Assistant and Home to be an open platform for developers. op12 They're definitely thinking about it, but who knows how long it'll be considering the Amazon Alexa integration took months... https://twitter.com/JohnLMacFarlane/status/733013734625415168 Benoit Bourdua Plex seems like something people would want to see there. Corbin Davenport If it had Plex support, at least for audio, I would buy one. Benoit Bourdua I play my music using Plex on Synology + Chromecast Audio. Not sure I'll buy one, but if there is no support for that combo it's a sure thing I won't. MicroNix Synology, what a great NAS. Worth every penny. Blake Mitchell I'm starting to regret getting a QNAP. komal You have a nice thought and very creative and awesome http://www.printablecalendar2017.us/2016/07/february-2017-calendar.html Soundjudgment Plex just finished its app update-release for iOS and iPhone/iPad.

Will it work? Even with an iPhone? Boolean Corporation Netflix or bust Angst They (At the event on October 4th) said that Netflix was already on-board with making integration in the 'very near' future JSo So anything that works with the Chromecast should work with the Nexus Player, right? João Dias So does this mean that Google keep is getting an api? :D Andrew Gallagher Any idea how it will work in a multiple Google account household? Andy J Yup....... until they implement something - you know - sensible.... currently you have to find out who is logged in, find them, ask them to log out (using their phone), log in and perform whatever it was you wanted to do (which you could of done 10 times over with just your phone by the time you get logged in to it). I wish they had resolved this issue BEFORE selling it.... scasmflop Video list seems a bit light... I would guess that Google Play Movies should be in there as well. I thought I remembered them calling up "Stranger Things" during the on stage demo to insinuate netflix also working in some capacity. Thomas Paulsen After the I/O event I was expecting that we would see some cunning home automation examples. Google is full of engineers that like to cook-up some awesome things. But we didn't see that. The only native home automation partner appears to be Nest. No word on the level of integration. Say an object moves into the Nest camera view. Let me see a live stream on my Android TV. Instead we are getting SmartThings support. SM had horrible latency at one point. So not only does my command have to go through Google but also through SM and back. Not to mention SM security concerns. No word on Brillo and Weave standards. Very concerning. I'd by a Google Home supported door lock right away. Smart door locks have been a disappointment so far actually. Defenestratus Smart things no longer has horrible latency. surethom Hopefully by the time Google Home comes to the UK next Summer or later, I hope Wemo & lifx are supported, & also able to select Hot word, even Hey Google is better than Ok Google. trent Why no voice calls over hangouts.

Lars Jeppesen Allo MrCalifornia I wonder if there will be two user support.

In a house with 4 people, separation is a must. They haven't made any mention of it, so I'm guessing it's just one account. Andy J yup (at a time). Andy J I hope to see Logitech Media Center on here - it already supports Chromecasts so I expect they will do something..... Defenestratus I use a harmony hub through smartThings which is integrated with Home so I can control my heat pumps. Greg DePasse I (and 100's of others - https://goo.gl/KVWzkI) would like to know if Google Home (and Assistant for that matter) will work with GSuite accounts (the new Google Apps for Domain/Work etc). Assistant currently access personal details in Allo for instance, so it's not promising for those of us that pay for GSuite accounts for our families. mcdonsco Hopefully Google doesn't pull an Amazon and exclude ecobee because of nest; so far it looks that way :-/ Dn Bro I think you could try using ifttt nxtiak I have my Ecobee hooked to Smartthings Hub then to Google Home. It works. Đức Thành Would love to see some good podcast apps on that list. TuneIn is "Meh". Beast TuneIn is great for internet radio, I use it all the time :) Đức Thành I used to use TuneIn frequently, but then Pocket Casts happened. It's not perfect but it offers a significantly better experience. You should give it a try. Defenestratus Google Play Music does podcasts. Đức Thành I'm aware, but it does not in my country. xanok No Ecobee? doom Alexa can turn the temperature up or down on a Nest but can't turn the heat or cool on if it is set to off. If Google Home can do that, I'll switch right away. Beast I expect since Google bought Nest they will have full app integration as part of Google Home :) nxtiak I have an Ecobee3 thermostat and both my Alexa and Google Home is limited in what it can do the same thing it's weird. If it's on or auto it can switch, but if it's off, I can't set it to Auto. Emanuele Ricci I would really love to see an integration with Netatmo.

Having to unlock my phone, open the app, and then change the lights is too many steps for me to do with a smart device like lights. dhamp2g People are All these services with with very small followings when compared to google Eco system many of which who have never heard of in the general from non tech community this is aimed at the general population bill875 Support for Insteon would be nice. I have SmartThings as well for my Schlage locks, but Insteon controls some of the lighting in my house. DongoDongo Not trying to be negative but, can someone remind me why you need to "aumotate" your home, especially by voice? I can probably toggle the switch more than 10 times before you're done with a voice command. Adam Margeson Are you asking about reality, or what they're trying to sell me? They're selling me the ability to turn on/off the lights from the couch without having to get up. Not having to get up is not worth my health or however much they want for this and a couple of "smart lights". Beast Or in fact the total home automation, i.e. when you leave the house the lights turn off, when you come back they turn on, music can start to play when you come home, etc, etc. It isn't about convenience, it is about a new technological era.... :) Marko Šaric Is this an intentional oversimplification? Adam Margeson A little bit. I use Tasker to do all sorts of little automations of settings or interactions on my phone. But I'm not the average person - I like taking time to tweak and program things to make future interaction easier for myself. Most people aren't that enthusiastic about programming automation or will get frustrated with setting up rules that fit most situations properly. Example: "Arm my alarm system when I leave the house" -> the wife is still home when you walk out, the system still arms itself. "Do what I mean, not what I say," is something that comes to mind for how users want automation to work. When computer AI and sensing technology get to a much better state, we might be able to do that, but right now, proper automation takes a *lot* of patience to set up. Marko Šaric Fair enough. Defenestratus Because I can turn lights on and off without leaving my chair. For example, I Just told my Google Home "Hey Google turn on the christmas tree" and voila, its on. Its equally as useful when you want to turn on a whole room full of lights at the same time. in my Kitchen I have four different light switches that I'd need to tap in order to turn on all the lights. Instead I just say "Ok Google turn on all the kitchen lights" and bam. On. Likewise its great for dimming them. "Hey google dim the kitchen lights to 25%" Letting the dog out the back door, I go "OK google, turn on all the outside lights" turns on all of the fixtures outside. Now that I've lived with it for a few months, I don't know how I lived without it. (I have all of my switches linked through SmartThings) Leonardo Baez You don't "need" Its an option. Think of that disabled people who can switch lights, set temperature o turn on a tv just with their voice Tucker Sferro how convenient for Google that my Nexus 6 Google now voice activation from any screen is no longer available!! it visibly toggles itself off in settings, and other Nexus 6 owners have had the same issue for quite some time now. Beast Would be nice to get Hive integration, proper Cast to Sonos would be the selling point for me. Angus Marshall Your list is out of date already... Gerardo Sarabia Now if only they unified Assistant on Home and the Pixel... not gonna happen. Gotta keep things as inconsistent as possible, because Google. ChilZeg what kind of unification are you thinking??? Gerardo Sarabia Having the option of controlling other devices (chromecast, chromecast audio or chromecast built-in devices, for example) with Assistant on Pixel. Stenso Has anyone figured out how to use Reminders? "Okay Google, remind me to take the dog out?" "Okay, when would you like to be reminded? Say a place or time." "When I arrive home." "Your reminder has been set." Jon Fridman You can't use reminders via Google Home yet. I'm sure it's being worked on for a future release, or at least I hope so. Stenso This really disappointed me. I just kind of assumed this would work since it has Keep and Calendar hooks. It was a big reason I jumped ship from Echo. Fingers crossed it makes it in soon. Jon Fridman Due to an NDA I can't really comment on what Google is planning for the home in that regard. I have high hopes for my Google home and it's future abilities. Lars Jeppesen I'm sorry but reminders are STUPID on a device that's stuck in your home. BierKerl Doesn't your dog remind you to take it out quite aggressively when you get home? ;-) Leonardo Baez Lol 😂 Lars Jeppesen Reminders on a device stuck in your home is just plain stupid. Stenso But it is convenient. And why would it matter if the reminders follow my google account and I can view the same reminders when I am away from home. Just because the device is stuck at home does not mean the reminders are. Alec M Mine has serious issues streaming Netflix on my Asus Nexus Player. Has anyone else had the same experience with maybe a Roku or something similar? madmaglio Works fine with my gen 1 chromecast. The Home just start the stream. It's the device that would be having the issue. Alec M Yeah, I have some friends that have the small chromecasts and they work fine. I have a feeling that the issue is having a device that has Netflix as a standalone app installed. Bill Anderson Shouldn't Android TV be on this list? I know it's kind of covered by Chromecast, but then it wasn't supported until a day ago. Garrett Penfield Mine STILL doesn't work with Spotify... mrlex You spelt Philips wrong (only one l) YaKillaCJ Enabling IFTTT was a big 1. Thru this I am able to use Google Home to control Hook Automation which controls any RF device. It's making me spoiled. Vladimir Only Murica. Right? Any rumors when should it come overseas? Adam Carl Aren't you forgetting Uber? I can link my Uber account to my home Abhinav You can ask question on Quora too. JG Is there a way to get it to prefer one service over another? I haven't linked Netflix to the account the Home in the living room is connected to. Yet when I asked it to play "How the Grinch Stole Christmas" it only looks on Netflix for it. It use to have no problem pulling the album from Google Play Music (which is linked to the account). [The album BTW is basically an audio book if you don't have any video casting devices online] I got it to work after specifying GPM, but that's a bit of a mouth full. And since there is me Netflix account linked to it... Shouldn't it attempt to use an it has access to first? madmaglio I think if you say "listen to..." i think it will assume its music and not the film and use Play Music. Gregg Long There is a serious bug going on with Nest Thermostats. The Google Home can't find it - keeps saying it's unavailable. Even though Google Now can control it fine when you are out of the house. shayden Google home + Smartthings + Harmony Hub + IFTT for custom commands is all the home control I could ever want. I have an HDMI matrix and 4 TVs. I can just say "ok google set the secondary TV to Xbox" or "ok google set the sound to chromecast". And of course I can control all the lighting with my voice. And the one thing for me that puts google home far above the echo is my ability to play whole home audio with google home and chromecast audios. "ok google play my favorite music on first floor". Boom, done. PerhapsNever Ooooohhhh!!! How are you doing the input commands? I've been DYING to figure out how to expose actual Harmony controls to my GH. My setup is 3 Harmony Hubs, ST, Hue lights, and IFTTT. shayden You use IFTTT to bridge the home and the hub. The catch is whatever command you are trying to accomplish with the harmony hub has to be an activity. so I have made a ton of different activities just to do simple things like switch inputs or adjust volume. You setup IFTTT using google assistant as the "if". You can choose whatever activation command you want and can also put in different ways of saying it as well as a custom response back from the google home. you make the "then" the harmony activity that you want to run once the custom command is heard. PerhapsNever Ahhhh, gotcha. I only have about 5 activities on each of my hubs, but I never thought about making activities for a single action. GENIUS! Thanks for the reply! shayden I recommend using the desktop app vs the phone app when setting up all the activities. much easier and quicker to work with a mouse and keyboard. NoConcussion The Google Home app has been updated to include more than 50 "service" apps. Too many to list and probably memorize. Apps like games, psychotherapist, search capability, local events, social media, language training, news trends, pizza ordering, personal trainer and more. abc I'll check out Home in a few years. Let the fanboys do the full-retail price beta testing. dhamp2g Love to. Vandale Gentry You can order Domino's pizza from the Google Home! PorchSong BTW, it's "Continually" updated, not "continuously." But thank you for maintaining this list. Emanuele Ricci Still waiting for Netatmo :'( Abdulgader Badkook You forgot to mention akinator. It is available by saying "let me speak to akinator" Shahul Hameed Akbar Why isn't Shield not listed in streaming devices? I am able to cast music and YT videos from Google Home to it since December. Kevin Brosseau So the New Shield is not supported yet with casting Netflix to the box? Ruperto17 Netflix does not work with Google TV, only Chromecast at the moment. Google Home will tell me if I try to send anything to my Nexus Player. pookietookie Google Home can set calendar reminders now? dcdttu Do the Honeywell thermostats require SmartThings? (As in, are they Z-Wave?) If so, should they be a subset of SmartThings? If not, nvrmnd. Artem Russakovskii No, they're just Wi-Fi, like Nest. dcdttu Well that makes sense then. :-) Now I'm just waiting patiently for Wink to get the green light. Adam Margeson Sorry, but since GH can't connect to it, we can't set the light's color to green. /s dcdttu It works now! Roy So am I missing something or is Android TV seriously not supported? Kostas 💪🎩 It's Bang & Olufsen James Ogle You've added Belkin Wemo, but it doesn't support their lightbulbs. Only their switches and power outlets. I've tried it, it doesn't recognise the Wemo Link hub or anything connected to it. bigwill_420 I see they didn't bother putting nvidia shield tv on the list. 😢 Leonardo Baez How do I use the services? mustbepbs Still can't add time to an existing timer. keithzg Remains only available in the US and UK. Dammit, Google, Canada is right here, on the same continent, and if you were worried about the spelling of "colour" on the packaging or something then you've already handled that with the UK, so what's the delay? Adam Margeson Quebec and it's requirement for French support. keithzg Yeah, but they don't have to sell it in Quebec. They already exclude certain provinces and territories from certain software and hardware products as it is, in fact. iantrich You're missing quite a few services and iHeartRadio is already integrated Anthony Chandler Any word on Sonos integration? I get that they're competitors w/ Chromecast Audio, but I've heard that Sonos is looking for tighter integration with popular services... AlRegals I really need Hulu to start working with Google Home. Ben K (digitalhigh) Ryan - you're missing my app "Flex TV'. http://phlexchat.com/get 4Ui812 These are all the apps and services that will work with Google Home [Continuously Updated] The question now is, will Google home work with them? Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ I'm sorry, I won't do that yet. Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ Now if only it supported apps on Android TV. I really hate not being able to start Netflix shows on my SHIELD. iantrich GH no longer uses Google Keep MatchstickMan Have you guys considered putting superscript numbers next to the newer additions with a key at the bottom that states when the list was updated to reflect those additions? Mike W You should go ahead and remove Google Keep, no longer works with it. Chia iheart radio has been live for me for a couple of weeks Matthew Radzio Is there any chance you can add to this list what home automation requires a hub in order to function with Google Home, that would be awesome! BeyondtheTech Got one for free, looked at this list, then sold it. Echos are all over my house, this can't compete yet, in my situation. I can't be the only one who thinks so, Walmart is blowing them out at select stores for almost half price now.

MOSCOW (Sputnik) — US IT giant Google has paid an administrative fine worth 438 million rubles ($7.7 million), imposed by Russia's Federal Antimonopoly Service (FAS), FAS said in a statement Thursday. "Google Inc has paid an administrative fine of 438 million rubles, imposed by FAS," the statement said. © Sputnik/ Sergey Averin Google Searches for 'Victory Day' Among Ukrainians Reach Record HighFAS and Google on April 17 put an end to the two-year litigation in the case on the pre-installation onto Android OS devices of competing applications, concluding an amicable agreement. Under the agreement's terms, Google will pay all FAS penalties, including for failure to comply with an order on time. Google will also give up the exclusivity of its Android apps in Russia, pledging not to restrict the pre-installation of any competing search engines and applications. For violation of antitrust laws, FAS imposed on Google a fine of 438 million rubles, which accounted for 9 percent of the company's turnover on Russia's mobile apps market for 2014. Then, on November 2, 2016, FAS fined Google Inc. and Google Ireland Limited a total of 1 million rubles ($17,500) for non-compliance with the order. The US company contested all FAS acts in court, but, having lost several lawsuits, initiated talks on a peaceful settlement of the dispute. ...

This news comes after Google failed to impress with the launch of the Pixel and Pixel XL last year when it outsourced their manufacturing processes to Taiwanese maker HTC as it does not have its own production lines. According to news reports here, which cited a memo from Yuanta Securities, Google named LG as its next partner to expand its hardware ecosystem, with the possibility of LG winning a contract to produce some Pixel 2 handsets slated to debut next year. "Google's possible decision to join hands with LG is in line with the former's aggressive investment drive to turn its hardware business into the next key cash cow," a mobile industry source said. "The reported decision for Google to scrap HTC is because there are no rivals in the smartphone industry that have better manufacturing competitiveness than Samsung and LG." Samsung is not an option as Google's outsourcing partner, because the two are in a love-hate relationship over more than software and hardware partnerships. "It is true the much-hyped first generation of Pixel floundered. Observers point their fingers at its failure to properly manage the manufacturing process. That's why Google goes all-out to steal experts from Samsung and LG," the anonymous source said. "When it produced the Pixel last year, it may have thought billions of users of its services like the search engine and email would instantly snap up the handset. But most people turned a blind eye to it so Google seems to be working harder on its next handsets." This is not the first time Google has teamed up with LG on hardware. In 2015, LG has manufactured Google's flagship reference series, the Nexus 5X. LG Electronics refused to confirm the deal. "We have no comments for products that have yet to be launched," an LG official said. mhlee@ktimes.comMore articles by this reporter Moon urged to shun interventionism Moon hints at scrapping 'comfort women' deal in phone talks with Abe Moon Jae-in's inauguration speech [FULL SCRIPT] Banks need cultural change amid disruption Moon sworn in, offers to visit N.

May 11, 2017 • 7:50 am | (1) by Barry Schwartz | Filed Under Google Maps Prev Story Next story Tweet Pin It   Prev Story Next Story Joy Hawkins, one of the niche local SEOs in our field, posted on Twitter that she saw on Google Maps that Google automatically popped up an ad on the map for a local result. I'd often just say, hey this person likely clicked on the ad, that is why it is showing, but Joy has been doing local SEO for a long time, so I doubt it was a mistake. She said "ever seen ads just pop up on the map while browsing before?" No, I have not. It is un-Googley to pop up ads as you use Google Maps but who knows, Google can be testing this. Personally, I was unable to replicate it but here is Joy's screen shot: Is it possible she accidentally clicked on the ad? Sure. I mean, it is showing as selected in the left side bar. But Joy is saying the ad selected itself. Which again, is possible but I find to be not the Google way... Have you seen this? Forum discussion at Twitter.

But does that impact your crawl budget? John Mueller of Google says it does not. On Twitter, John wrote that Google will "generally crawl those URLs after we've crawled the important ones." Meaning, first they prioritize your crawl budget on your more important URLs and if there is more crawl budget left, they may go ahead and use some of that to try old 404s. John added "so nothing is used up" in terms of crawl budget in this case. Here is the tweet: @miguelpau @davidwkelley @googlewmc We generally crawl those URLs after we've crawled the important ones, so nothing is used up.— John ☆.o(≧▽≦)o.☆ (@JohnMu) May 11, 2017 If you click through, you can see the back and forth on this question but generally, when Google crawls 404s, that means you have extra crawl budget - which is probably a good sign for your site. So maybe a spike in 404s mean you have some excellent crawl budget expenditure for your site? Forum discussion at Twitter.

Think back to when website domains first started coming on the market. The smart people bought common word domains like pizza.com or party.com. These ended selling for millions of dollars when the internet caught on and started transforming how we all do business. But in the early 1990s, domains weren’t on the forefront of business and marketer’s minds. Emojis may be the same. In fact, Google recently re-allowed users to search by emoji back in May 2016 (while Bing and Yahoo have mostly always allowed it, according to Search Engine Roundtable). Yelp even started allowing emoji search on their website in 2014, according to The Huffington Post. Barry Schwartz also found that searching by emoji in Google image search brought about real images for the emoji used: Yes, many of the top search results do relate to the emoji itself, but there are also real photos of dogs. This, combined with Matt Southern’s news last year that Google recognizes emojis in tweets sent to them and provides search results for you, shows that Google is rapidly indexing and placing more value into emojis. The Eventual Rise of Emoji SEO As Google recognizes more emojis and indexes results relevant to them, SEOs need to think about the impact this could have on clients’ online visibility. In 2015, AdWeek reported that 92 percent of online consumers use emoji. Emoji use has only continued to grow since then. Marketers have certainly jumped on the bandwagon, with emoji use in marketing up 775 percent and popular campaigns like Deadpool’s emoji billboard making it more mainstream. Psychology Today reports that many millennials and generation Zers feel more comfortable expressing themselves in emoji format over typing out their thoughts and feelings conventionally. What’s more, using emojis to communicate is naturally going to translate into how people use search engines. We have seen a similar evolution in how Google interpreted searches with acronyms or slang terms. In 2009, Bill Slawski pointed out potential roadblocks for high-quality search results for acronyms or abbreviations that display the best search results for user intent. The same evolution for displaying search results based on emoji use is an easy inference to make. How to Use Emojis in SEO This brings us to how emojis can be used in SEO and for online content. As mentioned previously, using emojis in marketing campaigns has become more commonplace, but what about ranking for a single emoji or a string of them? Or what about using emojis in domains, as GoDaddy now lets you register? Emojis in Local SEO Let’s take the pizza emoji, for instance. Right now, default search results for the emoji show pages about the actual pizza emoji, not pizza itself. (However, it’s important to note that a nonsensical YouTube video by a young kid is actually ranking second for this term, as you can see in the above screenshot.) What if I put in an additional term Google might understand? Here, I searched [pizza emoji + near me] in an incognito browser: After I allowed Google to know my location, a Knowledge Graph popped up showing a pizza place near my location! Papa Keno’s has no mention of the pizza emoji in the Knowledge Graph or on their website. This means that your clients may already be ranking for emoji search phrases without even knowing about it. I tried a more obscure emoji with the “near me” phrase. This time, I used the two girls with bunny ears, whose meaning is likely different to whoever is using it. I personally thought it would bring up results about dancing. Instead, it showed me a Sally Beauty Supply nearby: As you can see, the intent of people using specific emoji to search could be open to interpretation. But this shows potential for optimization. Emojis in Branded Search Terms I tried a different approach, and used a common search phrase with an emoji: This brought up results from people using emojis in their videos, social media posts, and for sale listings. There weren’t any listings that didn’t have the actual emoji in the post. Emojis in City Search Going back to the local example (because many users are searching on their phone to research businesses and services around them), I searched the nail emoji with my metro, “Kansas City.” No Knowledge Graph, but the second result was a nail salon (with no nail emoji on their website or meta attributions): You also get local businesses if you search outside your current location. This search for bathing suit emoji plus “Portland Oregon” brought up a local Knowledge Graph with two swimsuit stores within the Portland city limits: Based on these searches, you would think it looks like Google is basically translating the emoji into a text version of what it is. However, the Google results for [bikini Portland, Oregon] compared to [*bikini emoji* Portland, Oregon} are different, once you scroll past the local result box. Here are the results for the emoji search, which I’d argue are more accurate to most users’ intent: And here they are for the text search: These were both done in a new incognito window. This means that searches that use emoji show different results than searches that use the text equivalent of what the emoji is. This example, as well as the others, shows sky-high potential for figuring out how to optimize for emoji-based searches. Are People Actually Searching Using Emoji? While we know that search engines allow users to search by emoji, are users actually doing it? I tried searching a few common emojis used in the above examples in one SEO tool, but didn’t get any data. Schwartz did report in February that if you do get traffic from emoji search results, they can show up in the Google Search Console. As emoji use in our everyday communication becomes even more rampant, we may be able to get a better handle on how users are actually searching using emojis in search engines. Until then, we can prepare by seeing what emoji searches our clients or business may already be ranking for and testing emoji use in our own content to see if that influences emoji SERP position.

That’s what makes it so fun, right? Analytics programs let you measure everything from who and where your website visitors come from to what content they are interested in. NB: This is a viewpoint from Vikram Singh, author of the Words of Vikram blog. These engagement and conversion metrics can help you understand what is really working when it comes to your website and marketing efforts. Some hotels have an in-house digital marketing team, but most outsource their online campaigns to an agency. Either way, these teams are usually tasked with producing an ROI (return on investment) report for every dollar spent on channels like Google AdWords, Facebook, etc. There is an industry-wide obsession with knowing where the last revenue-generating click came from. This metric invariably takes center stage in marketing meetings, ensuring that the conversation never moves beyond the last click and how much revenue was booked. Ignoring overall marketing channel performance might have worked for hotels in the good old days, but not today. A lot of hotels are struggling to understand why they are not seeing massive returns on their advertising dollars anymore. Even brand name traffic and clicks are in decline. So what has eroded your marketing campaign power? The villain in this story – the one preventing you from moving forward – is this thing called last click attribution. It has derailed countless hotel marketing campaigns for both large and small operators. I’d like to take some time to help you understand attribution models in the hospitality and travel business, and how they affect your marketing efforts. What is an attribution model? The good news is that most hotels and inns are spending some amount of money on digital ads. The bad news is that decision-makers have a limited understanding of how online marketing works today, and which strategies they should be crediting for the successes and failures of their campaigns. Let’s dive right into attribution – this is a set of rules that that help you determine which touchpoints along the conversion path should be getting the credit for the final sale or conversion. Sounds simple… but it’s not. What makes it tremendously complicated in our sector is the number of touchpoints involved when someone is planning a trip, and subsequently a hotel stay. A touchpoint is any point of contact that occurs between you and your customer; in our case, we are discussing online touchpoints. Here is a list of some of the touchpoints that might occur between your hotel and a potential guest who is planning a trip to Sydney over a period of weeks or months before visiting: Top-level destination research: airfare searches, Sydney travel blogs, etc. Neighborhood research: staying in Bondi Beach vs Central Business District vs iconic Sydney Harbor Hotel research: Narrowing lodging search by researching independent vs brands; top-ranking hotels for value and price on TripAdvisor; hotel websites, social media profiles, and blogs Things to do: online searches for top things to do in Sydney; lists and blogs about Sydney; seasonal events Dining: restaurants, dietary requirements and cuisine preferences, must-haves, food blogs, review websites While the above process is happening, your guest might also encounter some of these hotel-specific marketing touchpoints: Hotel display ads: placed on top travel blogs and websites Hotel location and value Google ads: “Luxury Hotels in Sydney,” “Hotels near Sydney Harbor” Hotel brand name Google ads: when they search for your hotel by name Hotel TripAdvisor Page: while they are still researching your price and value Meta/OTA rate shop: your listings, reviews, and rate profile Hotel blog post about seasonal events: useful content on your website Hotel email newsletter: perhaps they sign up to stay in touch before booking or arriving the hotel Hotel local dining guide; return visit for more useful content on your website Hotel Facebook ads: and other social media ads, while scoping out your social profiles Every single touchpoint is a crucial part of the shopper’s journey. This Expedia study showed that a typical hotel guest will visit over 38 websites before booking the room. A typical website reservation that you are seeing today is the result of 30+ touchpoints that occurred at different stages of travel planning before the final act of booking a room. All the online channels you use today are more connected than ever; they must work together to support your goal of getting a booking. If you are only looking at where the final click came from when attributing revenue, you are missing the big picture. The very last step in a long decision-making process has not single-handedly earned the booking. It doesn’t make sense to allocate your entire marketing budget based on the last click that occurred before the booking. So, let’s talk now about proper marketing channel attribution. Deciphering the attribution models in Google Google has been working on making attribution modeling more mainstream, in 2014, it released the Attribution Modeling Tool in Google AdWords. Google wants you to see how users interact with your ads, so you can run better campaigns. As of May 2016, you can integrate the attribution model of your choice with your conversion data and ad bids. Excellent tool for everyone involved! It’s especially helpful for the very few with “marketing” in their job title that actually log in and work on their marketing campaigns. Of course, if you are just waiting for agency reports to drop into your inbox, you cannot witness this beauty firsthand…but at least you can make changes to the way you measure success. Once you have decided to actively assign attribution for your paid and earned marketing efforts, you have to determine which model works best for your business. The following example illustrates how each attribution model would work for a hotel reservation with four touchpoints. Touchpoints Touchpoint 1: Google PPC Ad. Guest X finds your hotel website for the first time by clicking on one of your Google AdWords campaign ads for “luxury hotels in Sydney.” They browse the website and consume your content and photos. You capture their email address (with their permission, of course). Touchpoint 2: Facebook Ad. Two weeks later, Guest X returns to your website, this time from a Facebook Ad about “Things to do in Sydney.” Touchpoint 3: Email Marketing. Five days later, you send them an email about upcoming events in Sydney and why your hotel is in the best location to enjoy them. You get a click-through. Touchpoint 4: Direct Traffic. The next day Guest X books a room directly on your website by typing www.yourhotelname.com into the browser. Mission accomplished! Your attribution options Last click attribution. The last click before booking, in this case your website’s direct traffic source, gets 100% credit for the reservation. First click attribution. The first touchpoint, your Google AdWords campaign ad for “luxury hotels in Sydney,” gets 100% credit for the reservation. Linear attribution. Every touchpoint – Google AdWords, Facebook, Email and Direct – gets equal credit for the reservation (25% each). Time delay attribution. The touchpoints closest to the reservation dates get the majority of the credit. In this case, Email and Direct get most of the credit; Google AdWords and Facebook get less. Position-based attribution. The first and last touch points (Google AdWords and Direct) get 40% credit each, and the remaining 20% credit for the reservation is divided evenly between the middle touchpoints. Facebook and Email get 10% each. Data-driven attribution. This model gives credit for conversions based on the steps people have taken to find you and ultimately book a room with you. It uses data from your own account to determine which ads, keywords, and campaigns have the greatest impact on conversions. This is only available to accounts that have accumulated enough data over time. I love this model! Where can you see all this? Oh, it’s right there in your Google Analytics dashboard! Look under Conversion > Attribution. (I have always loved GA. Here is why I think it’s better than anything fancy out there) Why should you abandon last click attribution? Everyone would like to see the return on a marketing investment. It helps you justify why you did what you did, right? The cliché “what gets measured gets done” (used by folks who love management guru books) is very hard to implement in digital marketing. I want to be clear that measurement is not the enemy here. It’s how you draw insights from the data that makes or breaks your marketing campaigns and future revenue. Marketing budgets are already in very short supply in the hotel business. Imagine what happens when the allocation of these tiny budgets is determined solely by the last click that generated a booking. The result is apparent in hundreds of marketing reports today. It’s just not working anymore. It’s time to let go and move on. The booking journey The path to booking a hotel room today spans multiple websites and devices: online travel agents, metasearch, review sites, social media, etc. When you are dealing with 38 touchpoints, it’s not enough to look at the bottom of the funnel. Instead, ask yourself what you are doing to help your guest move through their booking journey. Do you think your typical pay per click brand name ad “Official Website: Book Direct And Save!” helps when someone is still researching your location? No, it doesn’t! Are you speaking with your guests on social media? Or is your Facebook strategy just serving up a “25% off for Spring Break” display ad? What about email? Is it all about 35% off your best rates? Is that the only conversation you are having with your guests? Focusing on the last touchpoint prevents you from helping your guests during the planning process, before they are ready to book. You are so busy moving marketing dollars to campaigns that target the last touchpoint that you never feed and fund top-of-the-funnel activities and channels. Ultimately, the volume is going to decline and you are going to end up playing the price game instead of selling value. Under-utilising your marketing arsenal and agency By giving 100% credit to the last click channel, you shift the focus of your marketing campaign to that one channel. All eyes are on the tool that is converting and showing a healthy return on investment. Hotel marketing agencies get stuck producing “ROI Reports” to justify their existence every single month. Fixation on one channel kicks off a vicious cycle in which your revenue numbers start to decline, you fire the agency, hire a new one, repeat. This is particularly harmful if your digital assets are not in your control and you start from the bottom every time just like Sisyphus. Your website, campaigns and data need to consistently grow over time, and not get disrupted or lost when you change vendors. Content production, photography, social media conversations, and email conversations are all part of your full marketing arsenal. Don’t go to battle with one weapon when you have a wide range of tools that allow you to target every single phase and touchpoint of the booking cycle. Others prosper while you analyze I have previously written about dinosaur metrics to avoid and super metrics to embrace. With most marketers 100% focused on the last click at the bottom of the funnel, the top-of-the-funnel playing field is wide open in the travel business. Online travel agents have done a great job of focusing on the entire travel journey. Of course, they bring tons of cash to the game and dominate paid channels…but there is a ton of work on the top of the funnel that is funded by conversions. They run, manage and curate thousands of websites that have content relating to the early stages of the travel-booking journey. As a result, they build trust and solid brand names in the travel business without owning a single bed. When you leave opportunity on the table, someone will always be there to seize it. Conclusion Booking a room at a hotel, bed and breakfast, or Airbnb is a process. First comes the destination, then the location within the destination, then a price and value comparison, and finally the right user experience to complete the booking. Judging your hotel and travel marketing campaigns at the finish line incorrectly assigns all the praise and investment to one single component. In time, your super-performing touchpoint will face a decline and stop producing revenue for you on its own. New lemons are needed to make more lemonade. Stop squeezing the life out of your campaigns by focusing on the last click. NB: This is a viewpoint from Vikram Singh, author of the Words of Vikram blog.

The real reason hotels see low ROI is 1) they’re not as good as OTAs on the product optimisation side while competing for the same SERP spots 2) most performance marketing agencies have a major conflict of interest with their clients as most charge % of total spend. Some will agree to some ROI benchmarks then like to use vague attribution models. One popular method is attributing revenue/ROI from paid branded search campaigns to the agency, which is total BS.

Google acquires VR developer Owlchemy Labs by Ben Parfitt Thursday, May 11th 2017 at 9:26AM BST Print this page Email Share on Twitter Share on Facebook Share on Google Share on LinkedIn Job Simulator and Rick and Morty: Virtual Rick-ality developer Owlchemy Labs is now owned by Google. Google is going big on VR following the release of its Daydream platform, and the studio's early success with Job Simulator clearly made it a priority target. Owlchemy recently discussed the importance it placed on being a multiplatform virtual reality developer, and indeed this is a message that's reiterated in this latest announcement, along with the confirmation that it will continue to be a multiplatform developer. “As we look to the future with Google by our side, we couldn’t be happier. Our plan to build awesome things will continue forward stronger than ever,” it said. “This means Owlchemy will continue building high quality VR content for platforms like the HTC Vive, Oculus Touch, and PlayStation VR. This means continuing to focus on hand interactions and high quality user experiences, like with Job Simulator. “We are continuing to do all of this with even more support and focus on building awesome stuff. It’s incredibly exciting that Google and Owlchemy are so well aligned on our goals and vision for the future of VR. “VR acted as an electromagnet for our science-focused brains as it presented us with the most expansive field of untapped potential and tough unsolved problems. Once we dipped our toes into the VR waters in the early DK1 days, we quickly vowed to never look back and build a flat-screen game again, and to jump headfirst into the awesome potential of VR. The studio was hooked and we’d found our stride.” Google itself added: “We care a lot about building and investing in compelling, high-quality, and interactive virtual reality experiences and... we work with partners and support developers and creators outside of Google to help bring their ideas to VR. “We're thrilled to welcome Owlchemy Labs to Google. They’ve helped set a high bar for what engagement can be like in virtual worlds, and do it all with a great sense of humour. “Together, we'll be working to create engaging, immersive games and developing new interaction models across many different platforms to continue bringing the best VR experiences to life.” Advertisement Tags: google , VR , virtual reality , Owlchemy Labs Follow us on Related Stories Arizona Sunshine is coming to PlayStation VR May 12th 2017 at 7:43AM Opinion: No escape from out-of-home VR May 11th 2017 at 10:00AM Google Daydream View set for 2.2m sales in 2017, but Gear VR still market leader - IHS May 10th 2017 at 10:13AM VR: the final frontier - Ubisoft talks Star Trek: Bridge Crew and the challenges of VR May 10th 2017 at 9:57AM Gear VR still most popular headset, ships 782k in Q1 - SuperData May 10th 2017 at 9:40AM Get the latest news sent to your inbox Sign up to receive MCV's email news updates and access to other online products and services.

How to stop macOS Photos from re-uploading all your images and videos Video Can the iPhone make better AR than Facebook and Snapchat? | The iPhone Show Regina Bell has a conflict set of needs relative to how Apple structures photo storage and cloud-based sync and access: My iPad is running out of storage space. If I move photos to an external drive and delete the original photos from Photos, will they still be accessed by iCloud? She’d also like to keep her photos in an iCloud Photo Library, but separate out the pictures she takes on her iPad. You might not get quite what you want here using only Apple products, but you could reach the right solution with Google or Amazon. The first option is to use the optimized option for iCloud Photo Library. In Settings > iCloud > Photos flip the Optimize iPhone/iPad Storage switch to on. This allows iOS to dump the full-resolution version of images and videos once they’re uploaded if the storage is needed for your iOS device. That might be the solution you need, but with only 32GB on your iPad, you still might constantly push up against the limit even with thumbnails. While you can copy images from your iPad to a Mac's internal or external storage, you can’t access images from a drive (even a USB thumb drive with an adapter) from your iPad. And Apple only lets you sync a single Photos library on the Mac with iCloud Photo Library, no matter on which drives you store the libraries. What you could choose is not to sync your iPad to iCloud Photo Library at all, but rather pick Google Photos or Amazon Drive, both of which have solid iOS apps and use inexpensive or free cloud storage and can upload media automatically as you create it. Amazon Prime customers get unlimited photo storage and 5GB of video (and other file) storage at no cost; that’s $12 a year for everyone else. Unlimited storage for everything is $60 for all customers. Google includes unlimited photo and video service if you agree to let it downsample images above 16 megapixels and videos above 1080p. Otherwise, you get 15GB across its mail, drive, and photo services, and can pay for additional storage. Once uploaded, the Google and Amazon apps don’t delete the media from your iOS device; you still have to manage that part. But you can then view all your uploaded pictures and movies from Google and Amazon iOS apps and websites. Google and Amazon’s apps act more like a view into cloud storage instead of a sync service, so the amount of data consumed on your device is relatively little.

A Google search for a now-deleted Github page provides just enough information on a quiet collaboration between Harvard and Microsoft. Microsoft Azure appears to have scored a high-profile customer: Harvard University’s prestigious CS50 computer science class, not that anybody wants to talk about it. Harvard computer science professor David Malan. (By Chengfifty – Own work, CC BY-SA 4.0) A now-deleted web page on Microsoft’s Github account, originally posted in April, outlined a recent collaboration effort between Microsoft’s Azure team and an unnamed “major US research university.” The project deployed to Azure some internal applications that were previously running on Amazon Web Services and the school’s hardware, with help from Github and Codeship. Certainly, lots of major U.S. research universities are working on modern development practices and cloud computing, but when the name of a famous computer science class is included in the URL — CS50.html — it’s not that hard to figure out who was being talked about. CS50 is an introductory level computer science class at Harvard that has hosted guest lecturers such as Mark Zuckerberg, a Harvard dropout who nonetheless managed to make a decent living for himself. Its lead professor, David Malan, is a well-known speaker who actually filed for a trademark on “CS50,” causing a stir in Cambridge last year. After GeekWire emailed him Monday about the Github page describing the collaboration, Malan wrote, “We’re actually still on AWS, though most every summer we do tend to re-evaluate our apps’ architecture for the coming year, with AWS, Azure, Google, et al. always among the candidates. So no plans yet, but happy to reach out toward summer’s end if we’ve made any decisions!” Microsoft’s Github post was a bit more definitive about the use of Azure — saying, for example: The staff want the ability to expand the class without expanding IT infrastructure. They want to scale their current container environment to the cloud so they can grow without acquiring and laying down significant additional hardware or upfront capital. They also have applications currently running in AWS but want to reduce lock-in and risk associated with having only one provider. … This project is a success. It streamlined the university’s deployment process and provided Codeship users with a well-documented solution to integrate Azure into their pipeline. By keeping detailed records of the steps taken to achieve our goals, Codeship was easily able to create new documentation on their site so that less work will need to be done in the future for any users wanting to use the same DevOps toolchain to automate their processes. At some point after that email exchange Monday afternoon, the Github page was deleted, but the URL remains. And Google’s cache revealed the whole thing, excerpts of which you can read at the bottom of this post. On Tuesday, Malan said he was out of the office, and referred inquiries to Senior Preceptor Doug Lloyd, who repeatedly called the Github post “overzealous” in its account of the work done between Harvard and Microsoft. However, Lloyd also said that he’s not involved in the day-to-day development process, and was not part of any discussions between Harvard and Microsoft. Microsoft declined to comment in response to our inquiry. It’s not entirely clear why Harvard would want to keep the project with Microsoft under wraps; it seems like a better topic of discussion than the widespread cheating scandal just uncovered in CS50. Sometimes companies and organizations have a policy of not talking about the tech vendors they use, but Malan and CS50 have been quite active on the conference circuit, speaking at DockerCon and AWS re:Invent last year. Here are excerpts from the now-deleted post (the whole thing was over 3,000 words long): How a major US research university used Azure and Codeship to apply CI/CD to pipeline Apr 14, 2017 A major US research university partnered with Microsoft to learn and deploy Microsoft Azure infrastructure, Web Apps, and DevOps best practices to better address their need to quickly, easily, and consistently onboard classroom infrastructure apps to Azure Cloud Services. This included migrating existing apps running on local hardware to the cloud. The project took place over the course of three weeks with the premise of standing up all infrastructure needed in Azure, and completely automating everything so that all applications could simply be plugged into a GitHub repo to deploy. In the professor’s words, “I need you to get GitHub, Codeship, and Azure working together, and wire it all up.” Customer profile This US university is world-class, well known for its research and its alumni. For now, they would prefer to remain anonymous, so this document will refer to them as “the university.” One of their most attended courses is an introduction to the intellectual enterprises of computer science and the art of programming. This course teaches students how to think algorithmically and solve problems efficiently. Topics include abstraction, algorithms, data structures, encapsulation, resource management, security, software engineering, and web development. The class provides more than 40 different applications and services for their students. Some are hosted on-premises while others are offered on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud platform. A diverse selection of languages is used to deliver applications and services, so the class can use their own apps as real time examples of the principles they teach. Problem statement The staff want the ability to expand the class without expanding IT infrastructure. They want to scale their current container environment to the cloud so they can grow without acquiring and laying down significant additional hardware or upfront capital. They also have applications currently running in AWS but want to reduce lock-in and risk associated with having only one provider. The project will be documented so additional TAs could be brought in with minimal training required. The university would like us to help them stand up a single simple app that they will then use as a base for porting their other applications. The deployment should be able to be done by deploying to Azure (any language) including CI/CD. The professor prefers Codeship for CI/CD but it was not required. Using GitHub for a code repository was a requirement. The professor is already very familiar with DevOps tools and practices and knows how to apply them, which is why he wanted to engage Microsoft in this project (he did not care to share his current processes externally). To walk through the application development pipeline, we simply laid out what a fully optimized environment would look like. This gave the professor a great teaching tool for his TAs to create successful applications with the least amount of waste, lead time, and processing time. In this educational setting where there are no full-time employees working on code, there could be much waste and lead/lag time as TAs work through schedules. In the new, optimized environment, the individual TAs could work anytime they have time, which is often almost daily. The project we defined and delivered was exactly what they were looking for. It would be several months before the staff could put the new process in production. It is unfeasible to make major changes in the middle of a class this size, so full deployment and migration will wait until summer. After the solution is fully deployed, limitations on deploying apps and services in the middle of a class term will be minimized and in most cases even eliminated. This will offer tremendous value to the staff and the university. The professor was pleased with the process and practices we put together and delivered. They were also happy to have an easy migration path to Azure from AWS. They cannot start these moves right now because class is in session, but they will be using it extensively in the summer. Solution, steps, and delivery The professor opted to have Microsoft do all the work instead of having his TAs directly involved. He wanted us to teach him and his team how it all works through documentation. With this approach, the staff could vet out the documentation as they went through the first deployment. It was a perfect solution for an environment where your development staff turns over regularly as TAs advance and move on. This was also a great opportunity for Microsoft engineers working on this project to test their coding skills and their documentation skills in a single project. We found more great value by sharing documentation to the masses through open source and through a direct collaboration with Codeship. The class had already converted some of their apps from on-premises to AWS and found some challenges and limitations in that solution. One such example was when using GitHub, Codeship, and AWS they got apps working but they observed quirks (such as “One container per VM”). Our mission was to do it right, without any of the “quirks” or limitations. This would allow the class to spend less money for their applications and provide a simple way to migrate between Azure and AWS. Conclusion This project is a success. It streamlined the university’s deployment process and provided Codeship users with a well-documented solution to integrate Azure into their pipeline. By keeping detailed records of the steps taken to achieve our goals, Codeship was easily able to create new documentation on their site so that less work will need to be done in the future for any users wanting to use the same DevOps toolchain to automate their processes. Official Codeship Documentation This project provided the university the ability to “move forward” in their DevOps journey by showing them that even though they were already applying DevOps practices (using containers), there was much value in drilling into those practices, looking for waste, and filling the holes that contributed to delays and waste. They now know that taking a quick look at what they are doing is not enough. It is much more important to look at what is possible by evaluating where waste exists and looking for ways to eliminate it. Simply “applying DevOps practices” is not enough. We showed how waste comes in many forms. We found and solved problems for waste in terms of time for new TAs to ramp up, applying consistency to current practices, and saving real money by optimizing deployment methods and tools. A solution was delivered leveraging CI/CD through Codeship, Docker, Azure Container Service, and Linux VMs. These technologies and processes will save time and money. Challenges and solutions The following are the challenges we faced and how we solved them: TAs time to ramp up was weeks or months; now it’s a few hours. Running a single VM for each container was wasteful; now many containers can be run on a single VM. Managing the infrastructure (VM) was challenging; running Azure Container Service completely eliminated this challenge. Future enhancements to this project can be achieved by opening up the entire development pipeline to scrutiny. The university now knows how to look deeper into current processes to achieve better results. Next they will dive deeper into expanding the monitoring and alerting capabilities of the system running on Azure.

The Play Store adopts new app and notification icons with v7.8.16 [APK Download] Cody Toombs Follow View All Posts 2017/05/10 6:25pm PDTMay 10, 2017 110 Plus 1 on G+ 272 Share on Facebook 98 Share on Twitter Total Shares480 Applications Downloads News Google never stops changing things up. A new version of the Play Store app is rolling out to users and it comes with a new icons for the app launcher and notifications. They're simple cosmetic adjustments, but these are the types of things you can't help but notice as soon as they're on your screen. Left: Old version. Right: New version. The new app icon leaves behind the last remnants of the shopping bag icon that came along when Google still called this the Android Market. It is now just the Google Play logo with no other ornamentation. It's worth noting that the round icon variant hasn't changed, so it still looks like the Google Play logo on a dinner plate. Above: Old version. Below: New version. The notification icons have also gone through a little facelift. These also trade away the tote bag motif for the Google Play triangle, but slightly adjusted with the checkmark extending beyond the lines. The notification icons come in different colors for each of the content stores (e.g. apps, books, movies). The notification icon for stacked updates – when more than one app is installed or updated – is no longer a stack of blocks, it's just the same triangle app icon used with single installs. We're still looking for more changes in this update, but it's starting to look like this may be it. If you don't want to wait for Google to send this update out to you, grab it from the APK Mirror link below. Download The APK is signed by Google and upgrades your existing app. The cryptographic signature guarantees that the file is safe to install and was not tampered with in any way. Rather than wait for Google to push this download to your devices, which can take days, download and install it just like any other APK.

Powsniffer0110 4.0 FTW Burak Çalık they are not triangles, its the play icon. leganzish What shape is a play icon? I forget. Hachiko Google play books was perfect with Android 5 but only this one... Android 6 version is almost perfect TechGuy22 New icon every year. They are going to change play Store soon too lol Total Insecurity How do you know that? boop Unless you mean the name, the app just got another design update. sbeaulieu Isn't that the same icon from a couple of years ago? Tom Westrick We've always been at war with Eastasia Captain_Invisible Yeah.. they've used that icon on and off in promotion for a while. 4Ui812 Looks like I'll have to wait until it gets pushed. Apkmirrior won't let me download it (I don't turn off my ad blocker for anyone :-) Gjorgi Lazarovski You can download even with the adblocker on. You just need to wait like 10 sec for the download button to show up. sklatigre Can confirm Cakefish And you get to admire a cool cat. Richard Branches The play store icon on google chrome is still the old one, they should update it as well... https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/bca1aca3fd5b60e08fcd507e7c39b67f23f70ed0e4ff417bcf62881906f7106a.png Тарас Мукин Chrome apps were announced to be removed soon. Don't think they are going to bother. Richard Branches You're right about that, but they still will be available on Chrome OS so why not update it anyway?... Curt Because Google. Spazturtle Won't they be replaced in Chrome OS by Android app support? Richard Branches No, they won't... Tom Westrick If they wait long enough it'll just be back to that logo C64 Thank god / satan (choose your preference) for icon packs Konrad Krawczuk Icon packs are always kinda problem to me. If you have a few without icon from icon pack you must always fight with inconsistency. Powsniffer0110 Yes! I'm too freaking anal about this so I cannot use icon pack​s :( xyz Neither. C64 Sorry forgot the Atheist Jose Romero Google IO can't come sooner. Devin Studios Looks kinda boring compared to the old icon. Breathless So wait what happened to circles?... Cody Toombs Circles are there on the Pixel and in any other situation where the round icons are chosen. The triangle icon shows up on everything else. Anton Kuznetsov Triangles is the new circles burkett375 Since they love to A/B test, make 7 different message apps, etc....they should make 3 competing app stores/markets/hubs Ben Godfrey Don't give them any "good" ideas ;) Marcelove It doesn't matter... Google's employees are paid to keep an eye here at AP ... But it must be chimpanzees, because even with the clear feedback about stupid decisions they got here, they still don't give a f*ck and keep the screw route. Sumeet Deshmukh People who paid a lot of money to Google aren't getting these icon updates, the pixel guys mattcoz Because our icons already dropped the shopping bag, no need for an update. Sumeet Deshmukh I was a little sarcastical, I love my pixel (styled rom on my Nexus 5 (not x) Victor Stuber ya, but we got crappy white circles around all our icons. It sucks Leon I like my circles personally. sklatigre Gonna miss the shopping bag notification, kinda liked it. global etest You can keep it easily by icon packs.. sklatigre Didn't know icon packs can change the notification icons also. Margaritas Ante Porcos Google is a mess in everything. Mr. DICKHEAD it was always a mess.. Berkay Anyone else dislike both the circled icon and just the icon by itself? I prefer the shopping bag... It looks the best IMO. Thomas I loved the Android Market icon. Made so much sense SavageJeep What is Android Market? /s Salis Before Google Play branding, the app store used to he simply called Android Market. NooSH it looks like crap and i'm glad they are getting rid of it. Berkay So you prefer a simple triangle over a shopping bag? It looks horrible lol. TheDrunkenClam Completely agree. Google's whole ad campaign about Android was "be together, not the same". And then they make literally all of their icons the same by putting them in boring white circles. All in an effort to copy apple. I love the different sized and shaped icons of Android. Not a good look, Google. Jesse Kawell Once you see that notification icon "checkmark" ✅ as a 3D post lying down at an angle, you can never unsee it. BoFiS Aww, that's sad, and almost unrecognizable now since I still call mine "Market" on my homescreen... Branko Proof that Google lost the plot. reCoded So, the circle icon is the same I guess? Martin Let me read the article for you: "It's worth noting that the round icon variant hasn't changed, so it still looks like the Google Play logo on a dinner plate." Anton Kuznetsov This localization of 'update all' button text is awful https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/57e6791db8965bf1e13f4f50e3b6b5b303644e9c3f1660799bf9896ed1ef57b3.png Exalm ОМГ.

Have a nice day. thunderqus Only if I can find what you are talking about in English and posting screen in "who knows which" language. Vitias R. It says "Update your apps right today". I think that "Обновить все" is enough. Konrad Krawczuk Why it is not something like "обновить все" ? YuCMi Jesus christ Google. What sin did the previous icon commit? Was it too old for you guys? Grey Very ugly and hard to understand. Not intuitive at all. But I guess that's Google 2017! Lawstorant Looks generic af. Really Google? WTF? Maybe just go back to HOLO then? DragoCubed The new icon is nice but the icon in the notification bar isn't so nice. The one thing I don't like about losing the bag is the icon not representing a store. xyz OMG! TRIANGLE! NO CIRCLE? Like if you don't give a flying F about icon shapes. LOL I want circle, niggа! LOL New icon! Fuсk YEAH! Paul Teale Not circular then, not really following their own guidelines are they Kieron Quinn The round icon is round, the non-round icon is not. They're following their guidelines just fine Erimaru What about round icon? Curt I actually like this icon the most. Martin Spierings I already got complaints from people that didn't identify the play store or play icon with app store. So how the hell would this help people? They should realize that most people don't understand the connection google is looking for. Play is used for movies/film or games, not apps. The bag-background at least gave some indication on what to expect. The new one will get lots of people (those not really experienced with Android or mobile in general) to get their apps from there. These things should be self explanatory. And Google should drop the Play name (plus icon). Its a stupid name already. avnow well I used to get this icon pack, not exactly but close to this with an icon pack, this icon looks crisp! //moumon Meh.. I'm still using Elta icon pack :v That's one of the reason why I love android... Customize to meet your expectations <3 jcopernicus Awesome. A play button for purchases! Makes sense! Ra1nb0wD4sh DE Press Start to shut down Windows. :D (Not relevant anymore, I know) Ruben Tavano On the lateral menu the apps section was in the old green and with this update it has been updated to match the new green of the whole play store Alexander Reddicks The icon has been updated to support the new "adaptive" icon style being showcased next week. https://developer.android.com/preview/features/adaptive-icons.html Mr. DICKHEAD This is dumb theres nothing new I like the bodybag version.. but the naked one alone? seriously..?! David Onter The new icon looks HUGE next to the others. It doesn't seem to follow the spacing guidelines? Marcelove Google' employee : "Let's change an icon the people are used to and know for many years to something that doesn't improve anything." Google's executives : "Genius!” Biga173rd They can't make up their minds. madmaglio Finally. I've been replacing the bag icon with my own version of this for years. so much cleaner. VirtualWave I kinda hate it, it looks overly large and gaudy. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/d5821ea6199d4b4d1b5b7fa7fb41a252ab810c809090eb00f133b88f741b1735.png Follow Android Police 1.49M 468k 143k 115k Latest Deals 4 [Deal Alert] Get the LG Urbane 2nd Edition for $171.99 on eBay 2017/05/11 8:04pm PDTMay 11, 2017 4 [Deal Alert] Get 10,000 Amazon Appstore coins for $65 ($35 off) through May 25th 2017/05/11 1:34pm PDTMay 11, 2017 27 T-Mobile to offer 'buy one, get one' deal on Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus starting tomorrow (May 12th) 2017/05/11 12:52pm PDTMay 11, 2017 7 [Deal Alert] Huawei Watch in Jewel/Pearl $220 at Amazon ($330 off) 2017/05/10 7:32pm PDTMay 10, 2017 30 [Update: Deal ended] [Featured Deal Alert] Caseology is offering its new cases for the Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus to Android Police for as little as $5.99 for a limited time [Sponsored] 2017/05/10 2:39pm PDTMay 10, 2017 Latest Poll Do you use a screen protector on your phone?

Adding a screen to the Amazon Echo Show covers up Alexa's "shortcomings" the analyst said. Arjun Kharpal | @ArjunKharpal 20 Hours AgoCNBC.com SHARES Amazon's Alexa and other voice assistants are "far too stupid" to hold conversations with users and the e-commerce giant's latest Echo Show product with a screen is an attempt to address the "shortcomings" of voice interaction, an analyst has claimed. On Tuesday, Amazon unveiled the Echo Show, a voice-controlled speaker with a touchscreen display which will be available in June for $229.99. It's the next generation of its Echo speaker product. But one analyst has criticized Alexa, the artificial intelligence (AI)-powered voice assistant that allows users to interact with the device. "The problem is simply that Alexa (and all other others) are far too stupid to be able to hold a meaningful conversation with a user. Google Assistant is currently the best but remains woefully short of what one would consider to be a useful assistant," Richard Windsor, analyst at Edison Investment Research, wrote in a note on Wednesday. "Digital assistants were designed to replace the human variety but because their intelligence is so limited, they are unable to hold a coherent conversation with the user. Human assistants do not need to use screens to understand requests, relay information and carry out tasks meaning that the perfect digital assistant should not either." Google Assistant is the U.S. search giant's own voice assistant which competes with Alexa, Apple's Siri, and Microsoft Cortana. show chapters Amazon rolls out free calls and messages on all Echo devices    19 Hours Ago | 01:03 Windsor said that having a screen does make interactions with the machine easier and also could open the door for Amazon to use this space to advertise. But ultimately, the screen is an attempt to "make up for the huge shortfall in Alexa's cognitive ability," the analyst said. Amazon did not respond to a request for comment when contacted by CNBC on Wednesday. Google Assistant 'huge advantage' Windsor's comments come despite recent reports suggesting Amazon's dominance in the voice-controlled speaker arena. A recent study published by eMarketer shows the company has a 70.6 percent market share, and also that number of users of voice-controlled speakers is expected to double to 35.6 million this year. And in March, RBC suggested that Alexa could bring in $10 billion in revenues by 2020, driven by sales of devices containing the voice assistant, shopping, and cloud computing solutions that Amazon could sell to developers. Source: Amazon Windsor said that the Echo Show is unlikely to sell in large numbers with consumers favoring the $50 Echo Dot – a smaller version of the Echo speaker. This means developers are unlikely to create new "skills" or apps for the Echo Show. "This is where Google Assistant has a huge advantage as it has already been designed to run with a screen (smartphones) meaning that adapting to having a screen on the Google Home product should be much easier and much better," the analyst said. "We still think that Google Home has the advantage here as it has a much better assistant than Alexa, but its lack of developer support for the smart home is starting to be a real problem. Google really needs to pull its finger out and show developers love, especially as Microsoft looks set to launch something similar to Echo Show but using Cortana." Alexa as operating system Other analysts suggest that voice assistants are in the "first innings", meaning it is early days for the technology and Amazon's Alexa is, in fact, taking a lead. "I'd argue that Amazon is actually, from a technology footprint, years ahead of rivals. If you focus too much on Amazon Echo then you completely miss the bigger picture which is the operating system opportunity of Alexa that goes way beyond Echo," Neil Campling, technology, media and telecoms analyst at Northern Trust Capital Markets, told CNBC by email on Wednesday. Indeed, Alexa could act like an operating system – similar to what Google's Android is to mobile – to power the Internet of Things (IOT), which refers to millions of internet-connected devices. "Until now basically everything connected is essentially individually connected rather than harmoniously linked on a unified platform or operating system. And it is voice assistants, or actually the operating system behind them, that can provide that bridge," Campling said in a separate note earlier in the week. "Even the partnerships, product announcements and technologies it feels to us as if Amazon's Alexa has the chance to do to IOT what Windows did to computing."

Google won’t kill screen hijack nasties on Android 6, 7 until the summer By rascal23 - May 11, 2017 283 0 Nearly 40 per cent of Android users are vulnerable to a security design flaw that Google won’t fix until the next major revision of the mobile operating system. The cockup is a strange one, and was spotted by researchers. It affects Android 6.0.1 (aka Marshmallow) phones and above, which according to the official Android dashboard, means 38.3 per cent of devices are hit. Google will address the design blunder in Android O, which will most likely be out this summer or autumn. Fingers crossed you get the update if you’re on Android 6 or 7 today. In the meantime, Google will continue to rely on its Bouncer software, which automatically checks apps in its store for evil intent, and removes them if they are naughty – and abusing overlay windows will get you kicked out. Google also has human inspectors that follow up and go through code that raises a red flag. But as we have seen multiple times, Google’s system is not perfect (neither is Apple’s, for that matter) and rogue apps get into the Store. Last month nearly 50 applications were pulled from the Play Store because they contained ad fraud software. In April similar apps were also removed after an investigation. But the real danger is from third-party Android app stores. These are already known to be a seething mass of malware, but are still popular, particularly in Asia and Russia – and the SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW permission is ripe for abuse in these unregulated souks.

Name: Subject: Message: LG denies claims it’ll be Google’s partner for Pixel 3 smartphones Newsby Brian Reigh19 hours ago 21 390 15 The latest report from South Korea claims that LG could replace HTC to manufacture the Pixel 3 smartphones, set to be released during H2 of 2018, but LG has officially dismissed the claims as mere speculation. See also: Google Pixel review: a technical deep dive November 28, 2016 Google changed its strategy a bit last year and finally jumped into hardware. The search giant officially killed off the Nexus brand and gave us the Pixel and the Pixel XL instead. While their design was controversial to say the least, they ultimately proved to be very popular. Now, we’ve already started seeing rumors regarding second-generation Pixel phones, but according to Chosun Biz, Google may have already picked LG as its partner for 2018’s Pixel 3 smartphones. The South Korean site claims that Google is looking for a new partner for its third generation Pixel lineup, one who can provide “more stability” in manufacturing. Google and LG have teamed up previously on devices like the Nexus 4, Nexus 5, and Nexus 5X, and the search giant even reportedly offered to invest 1 trillion won or approximately $880 million in LG’s OLED display division. Google’s move is likely to be a part of its effort to secure a stable supply of OLED displays for its Pixel phones; after all, Samsung’s OLED panels are largely reserved for Galaxy smartphones and Apple’s iPhones. The report goes on to say that some industry experts think LG could even help manufacture the upcoming Pixel 2 and Pixel XL 2. Whatever the case may be, with the rising popularity of the Pixel brand, LG could see an increase in smartphone revenue if it chooses to partner with Google once again, just as HTC did. We have reached out to LG for further comment, and Ken Hong, the company’s global communications director, has firmly denied the report. In response to this story, we reached out to LG for further comment, and Ken Hong, the company’s global communications director, has firmly denied the report, stating that the information on Chosun Biz is “speculation of the highest degree” and that LG does not “deal in rumors and speculation.” How would you feel about seeing LG-made Pixel phones in the future?

Image: Google via AFP Relaxnews Google says that the beta testing phase for Android Nougat has now ended and that a beta version of Android O will be available soon. The Android beta website will be updated when the Android O beta program begins. While Android O is expected to be officially unveiled at the Google I/O conference, held at the Shoreline Ampitheatre in Mountain View, California, May 17-19, 2017, many of its new features have already been seen in the version currently being tested by developers. For starters, Google promises to boost device battery life with Android O by restricting the activity of applications running in the background, making them more power-efficient and less battery-draining. A new autofill function will be able to store data such as usernames, passwords, addresses or credit card details and automatically fill out forms. Plus, the update brings “Picture in Picture” (PiP) display capabilities for watching a video while using other apps alongside. ADVERTISEMENT Android O overhauls notifications too, allowing developers to create themed notification channels, grouping alerts from various apps so users can decide which ones they receive. In general, users will have greater control over notifications and which ones they want to see displayed onscreen. The number of notifications per app will also be displayed, as in iOS. Another visual change comes in the form of adaptive icons, matching the icon style to a user’s particular version of Android, with more rounded or square icon designs in the various manufacturer interfaces. This latest version of Android is expected to land in Google’s newest Pixel smartphones before progressively rolling out starting fall this year. Google is yet to announce which sweet snack will lend its name to the latest OS. After Android KitKat, Lollipop, Marshmallow and Nougat, could it be time for an Android Oreo?

[Minority Report] Google and Coca-Cola may target personalized ads at you - in real life Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/05/10 11:27am PDTMay 10, 2017 23 Plus 1 on G+ 45 Share on Facebook 49 Share on Twitter Total Shares117 News Videos Google and Coca-Cola's partnership effort for in-store advertising displays looks to be bearing fruit. The advertising system uses DoubleClick's preference and tracking data combined with Google's Beacon Platform to serve up targeted ads by pulling data from passing smartphones. With that info, displays are able to select content based on your preferences in the form of advertisements specifically targeted to passersby. In a recent grocery store pilot program the Minority Report-style ads performed quite very well. This isn't actually that new. It was discussed at a few places in the last couple months since the details were revealed at Google's conference. But, it seems to have quite effectively flown under the radar for that time, considering how cool it is. Coca-Cola made a detailed post about it on one of their social promotion sites in April as well, in which they talked about the potential environments for these tracking signage systems, like movie theaters and other Retail venues than just grocery stores. Google's partnership with Coca-Cola for this system has been discussed off-and-on for a few years. Back at the National Automatic Merchandising Association's OneShow in 2016 Google talked about the potential as applied to vending machines, and said that Google and Coca-Cola were working together on Bluetooth beacons for vending, but this is the first time I've actually gotten to see what it looks like and how it performs. Coca-Cola's Greg Chambers, at Google's recent Cloud Next Conference, said that it has been experimenting with small tests into proximity marketing since at least 2015 when they first started working with Google on a prototype. The two companies tested things with a pilot for the system in 250 Albertson's grocery stores, in which Coca-Cola saw some incredible results. There was a one year ROI on Coca-Cola products displayed by the system, and a spillover effect from so-called "category-lift," in the form of a total one-month ROI for all nearby soda products — i.e., this system sells a lot of soda for Coca-Cola and all other brands near it. There's no word yet on when or how Coca-Cola might roll this out to other stores, but given how positive the results were for the pilot tests, it is likely you'll see one someday at the end of the soda aisle in your local grocery. On a more technical note, I'm not sure exactly what sort of data is being sent to the displays by nearby phones or how it is taken. Allegedly the system uses Google's Eddystone beacons, which exchange information with nearby phones using Bluetooth low energy. This is the first time I've heard of Google's Beacon Platform actually being used, combined with DoubleClick's targeting advertising systems, to target people in the physical world. The privacy-conscious might express some concern at the potential of having your phone communicate your preferences to an in-store display, but I would hope and assume that any identifying information is stripped out. Either way, we're one step closer to this. Source: Digital Strategy Consulting Tags beacon platform beacons bluetooth low energy Coca-Cola Eddystone Targeted advertisements video subscribe ...

Anu6is Stop being absurd, how else would you know what you NEED? WesleySmalls Actually, you do. People require social interaction, it's a very strong part of our being. Humans generally don't like to be alone, and very much can't over longer periods of time. Because of this, people tend to follow each other's example in one way or another, advertising is just one of the many examples Ben Yeah, your phone communicating with a vending machine to give you personalised advertisements is not in any way 'social interaction'. WesleySmalls I did not say anything about that, it wasn't even remotely close, nor was the post I commented on. But of course, else you had to actually comment on my actual post, and realize that it's true that people follow other people Prezes Dyrektor But you are making it sound like advertising is indispensable in our lives. Well guess what, ads is the reason why I cut cable tv, they don't have those fancy adblockers. Ads is the reason I mostly listen to local academic radio without any. Etc. Ads and marketing are evil, and we are being manipulated every day. Now excuse me as I run to grab some sugar soda and candy. xyz Your second sentence was "People require social interaction". It seems you didn't bother reading your own comment. WesleySmalls Indeed, that was a art of my comment, which was a reply to a comment that wasnt about any digital technologies. Ryne Hager https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKlSVNxLB-A xyz "Humans generally don't like to be alone, and very much can't over longer periods of time." Right, that's why we have these things called friends and family. I mean if ads are your way making the loneliness go away, good for you. WesleySmalls It wasnt really difficult to grasp that advertisement uses these relationships and human behavior to advertise their product Avishek GSkynet: Resistance is Futile https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/eceea630e7e43621ded725c3914bdc7a06d9b153943c3512fb6b0f0eeff75d71.png Bryan Does it just give a different Coke commercial based on my tastes? Or are people going to start getting ads for the sex toys they have in their amazon cart? Bane✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ There's one way to find out.

Ryne Hager I actually haven't seen one in my area yet, when I go out west in a month I'll see if I can drop by an Albertson's. Carlos Rodríguez So, you have sex toys in your cart, right? Ryne Hager Obviously not enough sex toys, if you're questioning that. Carlos Rodríguez “( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)” yochanan Albertson's are now all Safeway's, FYI. Ryne Hager Albertson's acquired Safeway back in 2015, indeed. yochanan Right, but it wasn't until fairly recently (at least in Northern CO) that Albertsons stores have been converted into Safeway's. Francesco Lorenzet i suppose they will have a whitelist Bane✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Well, I'm a blank slate to advertising. I might as well be a ghost. I block all ads, turn off all targeted options everywhere, and never click on any. I guess I'll have to turn off Bluetooth when I'm in stores now too. Fadakar lol if you think your record is clean you need to re-evaluate how seriously you want to take privacy. James F This. People underestimate how much of a digital footprint they leave, even if they do turn off everything. EowynCarter True. And if they are, they wouldn't show me ads for coca cola, I just don't like that. And sodas in general. Cakefish Agreed, if I have to endure advertising it might as well be about products that actually interest me. Bewear I am a fan of your picture edits, Ryne. Ryne Hager What a coincidence, I am also a fan of your work. I kept a Bewear in my party for most of Moon. Anu6is lol! Lord Argyris My party was boring. Two of them were from Gen I, and apart from my starter, only one other member was from Gen VII. Now really, Nintendo should get in on this whole Coke-Google partnership thing. Maybe put something in their 3DS games that ties into this advertising platform. "Oh, so you're raising a bunch of Fire-type Pokemon. I'll bet you're feeling pretty hot right about now. Know what would cool you right down? A nice, ice cold COKE." Ryne Hager I mean, with the launch event Munchlax and Munchlax/Snorlax available on the first island, who in their right mind didn't take a Gen I Snorlax to end game. Michael Oghia I came here just to give you a +1 for Hypno Toad. Steve Actually noticed this happening to me recently when near the vending machine at my job. Guessing the capabilities will be endless and more diverse when full-on set-ups are placed everywhere. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/7ea9fde9939850ddee856f08d34c3e8a98a6c90461c779f049060ec4e655b8c6.png https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/f87dc3afe5a1492c33e179552b9fcf3259d388ef4a1a6cfed7951d9612faeae6.png https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/da689e538e0681368f0ef1dac408a796aa111781564a9ded426c4639fbeab351.jpg F4LL0U7 Disabling Nearby will disable invasive ads, you say? Done! Morten Ulv Google usually have a way to opt out. james fuston https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPGgTy5YJ-g Ben Nothing better than a new way to sell people tooth-rotting, diabetes-causing sugar water. Nicholas Conrad *This* is the gateway to AR! Aing actual R; genius! abqnm Are these connected to the "Nearby" activity in Google Settings? (Which also interestingly enough at some point has earned the ability to add the Nearby activity directly to the homescreen. Don't know when it appeared as I don't open that screen often, but it's now an option in the overflow menu.) James F Beacons typically use Bluetooth. abqnm Yes, and Google's Nearby uses Bluetooth LE scanning and Play Services location. But with Google being a part of it, I'm asking if it is directly related to the Nearby function. I am not asking for how beacons typically work. MJ Double checked BT is off on my phone... The only time ever use it is when play music on a BT speaker which I don't do when grocery shopping. "With that info, displays are able to select content based on your preferences in the form of advertisements specifically targeted to passersby" How does these ads work exactly? I am not watching a 54min video. Dedren You don't need bluetooth on per say. It just uses that tech. I believe you will have to enable Nearby places, which is disabled by default but will probably be enabled by default in the future. MJ Nearby places will not be going on... F4LL0U7 I'm not sure they could develop an ad that's targeted enough to get me to buy Coke. F4LL0U7 I guess I might consider it if the vending machine held a family member hostage or something. James F I don't know if I should be concerned that you said *might* consider it.... F4LL0U7 What can I say, I'm just not very receptive to ads. Dedren What about Water, Sprite, SimplyOrange, Powerade, Minute Maid? Surely one of those you drink...all Coke. F4LL0U7 I mean, of course I drink water, but I get it from the filtered pitcher in my fridge. No to the others. xyz You regularly purchase water from the Coca-Cola company? May I also say, I've never heard of SimplyOrange and Powerade. I had no idea that diabetes and obesity came in so many flavors. Adrian quickest way to turn me off on a product. Bluetooth is only on in my car anyway so good luck with it. As soon as someone figures out how to spoof it and annoy people in public, it will go away. Max Johnson I thought it's been NFC and GPS all this time. At least from my Android Pay app. Adrian I don't leave either on when I'm not using them so it's probably a non-issue for me then. blindexecutioner I would literally break my phone if I got an ad as I walked by a pop machine (or whatever) if I couldn't opt out of it of course.. I would switch to iOS that day. If it happened on iOS I would stop using smart phones altogether. tehboogieman You could just turn off bluetooth. Or you know, there's your way rndusrnm479461 iOS also supports this same thing. rndusrnm479461 I've read the whole article and even watched some of that video and I still don't get it - what do your "preferences" affect in the ads? How will it affect what the ad displays? Does it just play the ad you're more likely to prefer from 5 different ads? I'm confused... Why is such system necessary for something simple like coke? Would make more sense for a bus stop ad or other kinds of billboards. Joey1058 I hate to tell you folks this, but I've been out in the wilderness preaching this for at least a good 10 years, if you go by my 2007 blog post: http://joey1058.blogspot.com/2007/07/robots-dreams-is-vending-machine-robot.html Cakefish ALL GLORY TO THE HYPNOTOAD!!! xyz Damn, you got me. I have no choice now but to buy a Pepsi. psuedonymous "On a more technical note, I'm not sure exactly what sort of data is being sent to the displays by nearby phones or how it is taken." BLE Beacons are transmit-only. In order for a piece of ad signage to get any information from you, the chain works like this: BLE beacon emits location. Phone detects beacon, is informed that it is near location. Software on phone then queries backend platform (Google's Beacon platform in this case) to see if there is anything it needs to do with this new knowledge. This could be displaying a popup message, or in this case the phone itself does nothing. Instead, since Google's service has learnt your phone is near a beacon (geographically it cares not, this is logical nearness rather than necessarily physical nearness) so contacts the beacon owner with "Anonuser is nearby who hits your preset filter for Target users" (e.g. users who like coke, users who are above a certain age, users who have not previously pinged this beacon, etc). 'Anonuser' could be a unique but nonpersonal hash, a semi-persistant hash (e.g. for each ad client only), a time-limited persistant hash (e.g. valid for only a certain period before changing, probably just for the single proximity session), or just no hash at all so the ad client cannot track individual users. There may be an avenue for the ad client to pass a message back to google who can then pass it onto the user, without the ad client knowing who the user is.

By Michael Simon and Jason Cross Greenbot | May 11, 2017 4:00 AM PT Credit: Derek Walter More like this Galaxy S8+ review: The future of Android is now Best Android phones: What should you buy? LG G6 Review: The right phone at the wrong time Video Samsung Galaxy S8 vs LG G6 Camera Shootout Somewhere inside a deep, dark lab in Mountain View, a fully assembled Pixel 2 is being put through its paces. With a launch likely less than five months away, Google has all but wrapped up development of its next flagship phone, and very little about it is going to change between now and when it lands this fall. But unlike last year, when the Pixel was a pleasant and somewhat unexpected surprise, there’s a whole mountain of expectations on this year’s model. The original Pixel was sort of given a pass on some of the premium features we normally expect from a $700 phone, mainly because the overall experience was so good. But as 2017 phones like the LG G6 and Galaxy S8 pack on the features and make the Pixel seem more and more outdated, there are some things this year’s model absolutely needs to do to keep pace. We already know that the Pixel will have the smoothest version of Android O, but it’s going to need a little more than that if it wants to take the best phone crown away from Samsung.  What makes Pixel so good? The greatness of the Pixel can be summed up in one word: friction. “Friction” is everything that gets between you and having a good experience doing what you want to do. The Pixel is the lowest-friction of all Android phones. Waiting for Android OS updates is high-friction. With Pixel you get them immediately (and it was first with Android N, and first to support Daydream). Michael Simon One of the Pixel's best friction-reducing features: A built-in feature and cable to pull data off your old phone. Dealing with photo and video backups and running out of storage space is high-friction. Pixel gives you unlimited full-resolution cloud backups of all the photos and videos you take with it. Getting a great photo can be a high-friction activity. The Pixel has a dead-simple camera (maybe too simple) that is super fast and delivers a killer shot every time. Slowdowns, jittery frame-skipping, unresponsive touchscreens...other Android phones are littered with minor performance annoyances that make using the phone “feel” worse than it should, even with top-end hardware. The Pixel’s performance may not lead all benchmark charts, but its instant response and consistent smoothness remain unmatched by any other Android phone. Apple or Motorola taking away our headphone jacks? That’s the very definition of a high-friction move. While we would prefer the headphone jack to be on the bottom, the Pixel kept it right at the height of headphone-removal hysteria. Battery life is probably the most universal low-friction feature. Keeping an eye on your battery gauge, carrying chargers or cables, that’s a source of friction we’ve become all to familiar with. The Pixel’s great battery life meant that you could go all day every day without worrying about topping up. Of all the features the next Pixel could incorporate, we think the “zero friction phone” concept is key to its success. Therefore, we would like to see Google focus on those features that make the phone simpler and less stressful, the kinds of things that don’t require any space in the Settings menu. Some smartphone features are great, but ask too much of you—new accounts, sign-up processes, or lots of custom settings. We want the Pixel 2 to demand less, deliver more. Better design The least attractive thing about the Pixel is its design. While it’s not necessarily bad looking, its giant bezels, enormous forehead and chin, and two-tone back are more utilitarian than seductive, and in the shadow of the G6 and the S8, it’s really starting to seem kind of stale. Michael Simon Compared to the Galaxy S8, the Pixel is pretty bland. The Pixel doesn’t necessarily have to be a Galaxy S8 clone—and in all likelihood, it won’t be—but it will have to update its design if Google expects it to compete against this year’s hottest premium phones. An 18:9 screen is a strong possibility, especially since Google has already started to convince developers to embrace the new format. The landscape certainly seems to be shifting away from 16:9 in premium phones, and if Google waits another year to jump on the bandwagon, it’ll likely be one of the last on board. And along with the new aspect ratio, it’ll hopefully have a greater screen-to-body ratio. Oh, and one more thing: Please keep the headphone jack (and move it to the bottom). Camera The camera on the Pixel is already one of the best we’ve ever used, but with Samsung and LG stepping up their game this year, there’s definitely room for improvement. Like Samsung and Apple, Google works most of its magic behind the scenes, and we fully expect the Pixel 2 to take its awesome image processing to the next level. Google has already teased incredible results from its experimental nighttime photography techniques, and we’re drooling over the Pixel 2 possibilities. Jason Cross The Pixel already has one of the best cameras around, but there’s still lots of room for improvement. But there are other ways Google could elevate the Pixel 2’s camera. First and foremost, it could add a second camera. Dual-lens photography has gone from gimmicky to great, and we’d love to see what the Google’s hotshot image processing researchers could do with a second camera. A true portrait mode, wide-angle shots, or faux-optical zoom on the Pixel 2 would all be great additions. And optical image stabilization is practically a necessity. Google has defended its decision to use electric image stabilization in the Pixel due to its ability to improve the system over time, and while that may be true, it still pales in comparison to good OIS. And it’s not just for taking super steady videos. OIS helps enormously in low light, one of the areas where smartphones notoriously struggle. Google’s image processing magic relies on taking lots of very fast under-exposed images and adding them together using intelligent algorithms. Sony’s new Exmor RS sensor with stacked DRAM (coming in the Xperia XZ Premium) can do more than just super slow-mo video. It’s the perfect technology to enable extremely rapid bursts of still photos, and seems like a natural fit for Google’s multi-exposure HDR+ mode. No matter what Google does, it needs to keep it’s “unlimited full-resolution photo and video backups to Google Photos” feature intact. That’s a seriously useful benefit. Water resistance, SD card, and wireless charging Certain features that were novel just a couple years ago are quickly becoming staples for premium smartphones. And a few of the features that the Pixel was able to get away with not having last year absolutely must be in this year’s model to justify a premium price tag. Michael Simon The Pixel 2 needs water resistance like the LG G6. For one, water resistance. It was a bit of a surprise that Google didn’t include at least IP57 water and dust resistance in last year’s Pixel, but it was hardly the only premium phone that you couldn’t get wet. However, after LG brought it to the G6 and even HTC’s newest phone looks to be on board, some degree of water and dust resistance—preferable IP68 like the Galaxy S8—needs to happen. Wireless charging isn’t a must-have feature, but it’s exactly the kind of zero-user-effort feature that the Pixel is all about. Reversible USB-C is a lot friendlier than microUSB, but it’s still a pain to have to plug in our phones every night. Wireless charging might not be as fast as a plug-in charger, but the convenience can’t be beat. There are no settings, no menu items, no accounts...just put your phone down on the pad and it starts charging. Jason Cross We’d sure like the SIM tray to have space for an SD card in the Pixel 2. And while we’re at it, an SD card slot would be nice too. Expandable storage is one of the main differences between Android phones and the iPhone, and just because we have 128GB of internal storage doesn’t mean we want to fill it all up. It’s not high on our list, but we’d certainly love to pop an SD card into the next Pixel. Battery Life The original Pixel and Pixel XL have 2,770mAh and 3,450mAh batteries, respectively, and still are among the longest-lasting phones you can buy. But we’d still like the Pixel 2 to push it a little further.  Google doesn’t necessarily need to put bigger cells in the next Pixel, however. Apple has been able to eke tremendous life out of relatively pedestrian batteries, Google could use Android O’s power-saving benefits and really low-level software optimization to make the Pixel 2’s battery life way better. The Pixel is hands down the best showcase for Android, and we’d like to see Google use its advantage to stretch the battery even further. But a bigger battery would be nice, and just imagine the marketing possibilities from being able to honestly claim “two-day battery life.” Availability But no matter how good the Pixel 2 is, it won’t matter if you can’t get one. More than six months after its release, Google is still struggling to keep the Pixel in stock, and it’s not because of overwhelming demand anymore. It’s that Google just isn’t making enough of them. Jason Cross It won’t matter how good the Pixel 2 is if you can’t buy one. The vast majority of U.S. buyers still get phones from their carrier stores. Verizon may be the biggest, but leaving out 3 of the 4 major carriers just won’t do. When a customer walks into AT&T, T-Mobile, or Sprint to buy a new phone, the Pixel 2 just can’t be a no-show.  And the production rate needs to be easily ten times what it is today. Customers should have no problem going to Google’s online store to buy one.  Above all else, the people who want to buy a Pixel 2 need to be able to find it. To do less is to betray Google’s promise that the Pixel is not just another Nexus with a name change.

Grapevine Kudzacha Brands Corporate About KBC Careers and Opportunities Tenders and Documents Events The Mast Contacts SIGNET About Signet Contacts Charles Murito, Google Kenya Country Manager & SSA Telco Lead Giving an overview of online publishing in Kenya Technology  Google hosts largest Online Publisher Summit in Kenya May 11, 2017May 11, 2017 Grace Maina Charles Murito, Google, Google Kenya Country Manager, Online Publisher Summit By Grace Maina/Release Google hosted over 100 online content publishers on Thursday for a “Publishers Summit” according to them, an opportunity to explore and better understand Google’s Publisher tools, as well as the challenges and opportunities presented by an online ecosystem growing rapidly in both size and complexity. The Kenya summit comes after the Nigerian summit held on 8th and 9th May at Ikeja, Lagos. The summits are Google’s largest publisher-focused summit in Africa to date, and are aimed at helping Africa’s top publishers to explore and better understand Google’s Publisher tools, as well as the challenges and opportunities presented by an online ecosystem growing rapidly in both size and complexity. Through its Summits, and other initiatives, Google is empowering publishers to make money online and drive traffic to their sites. In this way, the company aims to give publishers the necessary support to help them monetise their content online, thereby creating opportunities for the industry to leverage technology in the digital world. The Summit which addresses the different issues being faced by publishers and advertisers, are designed to provide a more complete picture of the online ecosystem and the opportunities that lie ahead in 2017 and beyond. Key focus areas include the changing consumption journeys of online consumers as well as the tools available to publishers to optimise their benefits. With Google having its 2016 goal of training 1 million young people (of which 400K were from Kenya) in Africa on digital skills within a year, there is even greater need for high-interest published content for online marketing as these web enthusiasts start their own ventures or assist other web entrepreneurs with theirs. “Google Kenya is committed to adding value to the Kenyan people and businesses, by supporting their growth and development, as evidenced in our recent efforts of training more than 400K young Kenyans in digital skills. We continue to deploy tools and technologies that support businesses and individuals in Kenya to grow,” said Google Kenya Country Manager, Charles Murito. Google enables publishers to sell their content directly to consumers through Google Play Newsstand, which now features some 4000+ newspapers, magazines and blogs. And its search and ads services help publishers make money online and drive traffic to their sites. Google shared more than $11bn with its publisher partners in 2016. In October 2015 Google joined publishers, analytics and ad tech companies and others to announce the Accelerated Mobile Pages Project to dramatically improve the mobile web for everyone. “Google believes preserving a robust and independent press is important for society. When excellent journalism succeeds we all do better,” Murito comments. “This is why Google helps journalists use technology for reporting and acts as a collaborator and convener to listen and learn from those in the industry.” Other initiatives driven by Google to assist publishers includes the Google News Lab, which collaborates with reporters and entrepreneurs globally to help build the future of journalism, partner on projects, and build and adapt tools like Google Trends to help them in their work. In 2016 Google trained over 100 000 journalists directly. In February 2016 it opened Operation Shield, a tool for news orgs and human rights groups to protect themselves from DDoS attacks to all news organisations. “We boost content discovery and understanding through diversity tags like ‘opinion’, ‘highly cited’, ‘local’ and ‘fact check’ along with tools like ‘Editors’ Picks’ in Google News to allow editors to highlight original news content they believe represents their organisation’s best journalistic work,” added Murito. The Communications Authority of Kenya (CAK) estimates that out of the 37.5 million mobile phone subscribers in Kenya, approximately 25.6 million are using the internet. Recent CAK statistics (September 2016) also show that mobile data subscriptions account for 99% of Internet users. Moreover, 44% (nearly 13 million) are using smartphones for on-the-go internet access. At the same time, the PwC Entertainment and Media Outlook: 2015-2019 (South Africa,  Nigeria and Kenya), projects that total Internet access revenue for the mobile network operators will rise from KSH 95 billion (approx. US$930 million) in 2015 to KES 143 billion (approx. US$1.4 billion) in 2020, and mobile Internet access will account for more than 97% of this, as Kenyan consumers continue to derive their Internet experience from mobile devices. Therefore, the increasing smartphone-use and data subscriptions presents an exciting opportunity for Small and Medium Businesses to advertise their businesses affordably online, as compared to advertising on traditional media. To attract traffic to their online assets, Publishers have to adopt online publishing tools like Google’s and deliver quality content in order to among others, get advertising spend from businesses. “Online publishers are at the core of the web’s content industry, and it is crucial that they get all the support required for them to continue to “feed” the web with content, while also being assisted to grow their revenues and their businesses,” Murito concluded while speaking during the Publishers Summit. Google’s innovative search technologies connect millions of people around the world with information every day. Founded in 1998 by Stanford Ph.D. students Larry Page and Sergey Brin, Google today is a top web property in all major global markets. Google’s targeted advertising program provides businesses of all sizes with measurable results, while enhancing the overall web experience for users. Google is headquartered in Silicon Valley with offices throughout the Americas, Europe and Asia.

By including a short video in your slide deck, you can both clarify key points and spark an emotional response in your audience. Here are three ways to add video to a Google Slide. YouTube YouTube’s integration with other Google products makes it possible to find and add a video without leaving your slide deck. Here’s how: 1) Go to the slide to which you want to add a video. Click Insert from the top menu, then scroll down and select Video. 2) In the Insert video window that opens, you’ll see tabs labeled Search, By URL, and Google Drive. By default, the Search tab is active. Type some relevant keywords in the YouTube search window and click the magnifying glass icon. PCWorld You can find and add YouTube videos from within Google Slides. 3) Search results will appear right in the Insert video window. Click on the one you want to add and click the Select button. 4) Once the video is added to your slide, you can click-and-drag it to place it and resize it using any of the handles on the surrounding box. Once you have it where you want it, hit the Enter key to lock it down. If at any time you want to move or resize it, just click inside the video to make it editable again. Google Drive If the video you need is stored in your Google Drive, it’s just as easy to add it to a slide. 1) As with the YouTube instructions, select Insert > Video on the appropriate slide. 2) In the Insert video window select the Google Drive tab. You should see thumbnails of all the videos you have stored in your account. Click on the one you want to add and then click the Select button. 3) Follow step 4 above to move, resize, and place the embedded video in your slide. Other videos To add videos from other sources, you’ll use a text link on the slide. But leaving it there raw can make your presentation look amateurish and unengaging. Here’s how to add some polish. 1) Open the video you want to add and take a screenshot of an eye-catching moment. 2) Go to the appropriate slide and add the image to it either by going to Insert > Image or dragging the file directly from your hard drive. PCWorld You can add a screenshot to a video text link for a more polished look. 3) Move and scale the image, then click your mouse on any white space on the slide to get out of editing mode. 4) Return to the video and copy the URL. 5) Toggle back to the slide, click on the image and select Insert > Link. Paste the link in the box that opens, then click Apply. When you give your slide presentation, just click on the image to play the video from its source location.

The Play Store adopts new app and notification icons with v7.8.16 [APK Download] Cody Toombs Follow View All Posts 2017/05/10 6:25pm PDTMay 10, 2017 110 Plus 1 on G+ 272 Share on Facebook 98 Share on Twitter Total Shares480 Applications Downloads News Google never stops changing things up. A new version of the Play Store app is rolling out to users and it comes with a new icons for the app launcher and notifications. They're simple cosmetic adjustments, but these are the types of things you can't help but notice as soon as they're on your screen. Left: Old version. Right: New version. The new app icon leaves behind the last remnants of the shopping bag icon that came along when Google still called this the Android Market. It is now just the Google Play logo with no other ornamentation. It's worth noting that the round icon variant hasn't changed, so it still looks like the Google Play logo on a dinner plate. Above: Old version. Below: New version. The notification icons have also gone through a little facelift. These also trade away the tote bag motif for the Google Play triangle, but slightly adjusted with the checkmark extending beyond the lines. The notification icons come in different colors for each of the content stores (e.g. apps, books, movies). The notification icon for stacked updates – when more than one app is installed or updated – is no longer a stack of blocks, it's just the same triangle app icon used with single installs. We're still looking for more changes in this update, but it's starting to look like this may be it. If you don't want to wait for Google to send this update out to you, grab it from the APK Mirror link below. Download The APK is signed by Google and upgrades your existing app. The cryptographic signature guarantees that the file is safe to install and was not tampered with in any way.

They 'quickly' portray even to a naive what kind of app you will be clicking on, especially amid numerous numbers of apps. Marcelove .Google' employee : "Let's change an icon the people are used to and know for many years to something that doesn't improve anything." Google's executives : "Genius!” . Powsniffer0110 4.0 FTW Burak Çalık they are not triangles, its the play icon. leganzish What shape is a play icon? I forget. Hachiko Google play books was perfect with Android 5 but only this one... Android 6 version is almost perfect TechGuy22 New icon every year. They are going to change play Store soon too lol Total Insecurity How do you know that? boop Unless you mean the name, the app just got another design update. sbeaulieu Isn't that the same icon from a couple of years ago? Tom Westrick We've always been at war with Eastasia Captain_Invisible Yeah.. they've used that icon on and off in promotion for a while. 4Ui812 Looks like I'll have to wait until it gets pushed. Apkmirrior won't let me download it (I don't turn off my ad blocker for anyone :-) Gjorgi Lazarovski You can download even with the adblocker on. You just need to wait like 10 sec for the download button to show up. sklatigre Can confirm Cakefish And you get to admire a cool cat. Richard Branches The play store icon on google chrome is still the old one, they should update it as well... https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/bca1aca3fd5b60e08fcd507e7c39b67f23f70ed0e4ff417bcf62881906f7106a.png Тарас Мукин Chrome apps were announced to be removed soon. Don't think they are going to bother. Richard Branches You're right about that, but they still will be available on Chrome OS so why not update it anyway?... Curt Because Google. Spazturtle Won't they be replaced in Chrome OS by Android app support? Richard Branches No, they won't... Tom Westrick If they wait long enough it'll just be back to that logo C64 Thank god / satan (choose your preference) for icon packs Konrad Krawczuk Icon packs are always kinda problem to me. If you have a few without icon from icon pack you must always fight with inconsistency. Powsniffer0110 Yes! I'm too freaking anal about this so I cannot use icon pack​s :( xyz Neither. C64 Sorry forgot the Atheist Jose Romero Google IO can't come sooner. Devin Studios Looks kinda boring compared to the old icon. Breathless So wait what happened to circles?... Cody Toombs Circles are there on the Pixel and in any other situation where the round icons are chosen. The triangle icon shows up on everything else. Anton Kuznetsov Triangles is the new circles burkett375 Since they love to A/B test, make 7 different message apps, etc....they should make 3 competing app stores/markets/hubs Ben Godfrey Don't give them any "good" ideas ;) Marcelove It doesn't matter... Google's employees are paid to keep an eye here at AP ... But it must be chimpanzees, because even with the clear feedback about stupid decisions they got here, they still don't give a f*ck and keep the screw route. Sumeet Deshmukh People who paid a lot of money to Google aren't getting these icon updates, the pixel guys mattcoz Because our icons already dropped the shopping bag, no need for an update. Sumeet Deshmukh I was a little sarcastical, I love my pixel (styled rom on my Nexus 5 (not x) Victor Stuber ya, but we got crappy white circles around all our icons. It sucks Leon I like my circles personally. sklatigre Gonna miss the shopping bag notification, kinda liked it. global etest You can keep it easily by icon packs.. sklatigre Didn't know icon packs can change the notification icons also. Margaritas Ante Porcos Google is a mess in everything. Mr. DICKHEAD it was always a mess.. Berkay Anyone else dislike both the circled icon and just the icon by itself? I prefer the shopping bag... It looks the best IMO. Thomas I loved the Android Market icon. Made so much sense SavageJeep What is Android Market? /s Salis Before Google Play branding, the app store used to he simply called Android Market. NooSH it looks like crap and i'm glad they are getting rid of it. Berkay So you prefer a simple triangle over a shopping bag? It looks horrible lol. TheDrunkenClam Completely agree. Google's whole ad campaign about Android was "be together, not the same". And then they make literally all of their icons the same by putting them in boring white circles. All in an effort to copy apple. I love the different sized and shaped icons of Android. Not a good look, Google. Jesse Kawell Once you see that notification icon "checkmark" ✅ as a 3D post lying down at an angle, you can never unsee it. BoFiS Aww, that's sad, and almost unrecognizable now since I still call mine "Market" on my homescreen... Branko Proof that Google lost the plot. reCoded So, the circle icon is the same I guess? Martin Let me read the article for you: "It's worth noting that the round icon variant hasn't changed, so it still looks like the Google Play logo on a dinner plate." Anton Kuznetsov This localization of 'update all' button text is awful https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/57e6791db8965bf1e13f4f50e3b6b5b303644e9c3f1660799bf9896ed1ef57b3.png Exalm ОМГ. Это именно в новой версии вот так? Captain_Invisible That's your crazy language's fault. Vitias R. No it's not. Have a nice day. thunderqus Only if I can find what you are talking about in English and posting screen in "who knows which" language. Vitias R. It says "Update your apps right today". I think that "Обновить все" is enough. Konrad Krawczuk Why it is not something like "обновить все" ? YuCMi Jesus christ Google. What sin did the previous icon commit? Was it too old for you guys? Grey Very ugly and hard to understand. Not intuitive at all. But I guess that's Google 2017! Lawstorant Looks generic af. Really Google? WTF? Maybe just go back to HOLO then? DragoCubed The new icon is nice but the icon in the notification bar isn't so nice. The one thing I don't like about losing the bag is the icon not representing a store. xyz OMG! TRIANGLE! NO CIRCLE? Like if you don't give a flying F about icon shapes. LOL I want circle, niggа! LOL New icon! Fuсk YEAH! Paul Teale Not circular then, not really following their own guidelines are they Kieron Quinn The round icon is round, the non-round icon is not. They're following their guidelines just fine Erimaru What about round icon? Curt I actually like this icon the most. Martin Spierings I already got complaints from people that didn't identify the play store or play icon with app store. So how the hell would this help people? They should realize that most people don't understand the connection google is looking for. Play is used for movies/film or games, not apps. The bag-background at least gave some indication on what to expect. The new one will get lots of people (those not really experienced with Android or mobile in general) to get their apps from there. These things should be self explanatory. And Google should drop the Play name (plus icon). Its a stupid name already. avnow well I used to get this icon pack, not exactly but close to this with an icon pack, this icon looks crisp! //moumon Meh.. I'm still using Elta icon pack :v That's one of the reason why I love android... Customize to meet your expectations <3 jcopernicus Awesome. A play button for purchases! Makes sense! Ra1nb0wD4sh DE Press Start to shut down Windows. :D (Not relevant anymore, I know) Ruben Tavano On the lateral menu the apps section was in the old green and with this update it has been updated to match the new green of the whole play store Alexander Reddicks The icon has been updated to support the new "adaptive" icon style being showcased next week. https://developer.android.com/preview/features/adaptive-icons.html Mr. DICKHEAD This is dumb theres nothing new I like the bodybag version.. but the naked one alone? seriously..?! David Onter The new icon looks HUGE next to the others. It doesn't seem to follow the spacing guidelines? Marcelove Google' employee : "Let's change an icon the people are used to and know for many years to something that doesn't improve anything." Google's executives : "Genius!” Biga173rd They can't make up their minds. madmaglio Finally. I've been replacing the bag icon with my own version of this for years. so much cleaner. VirtualWave I kinda hate it, it looks overly large and gaudy. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/d5821ea6199d4b4d1b5b7fa7fb41a252ab810c809090eb00f133b88f741b1735.png Follow Android Police 1.49M 468k 143k 115k Latest Deals 4 [Deal Alert] Get the LG Urbane 2nd Edition for $171.99 on eBay 2017/05/11 8:04pm PDTMay 11, 2017 4 [Deal Alert] Get 10,000 Amazon Appstore coins for $65 ($35 off) through May 25th 2017/05/11 1:34pm PDTMay 11, 2017 27 T-Mobile to offer 'buy one, get one' deal on Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus starting tomorrow (May 12th) 2017/05/11 12:52pm PDTMay 11, 2017 7 [Deal Alert] Huawei Watch in Jewel/Pearl $220 at Amazon ($330 off) 2017/05/10 7:32pm PDTMay 10, 2017 30 [Update: Deal ended] [Featured Deal Alert] Caseology is offering its new cases for the Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus to Android Police for as little as $5.99 for a limited time [Sponsored] 2017/05/10 2:39pm PDTMay 10, 2017 Latest Poll Do you use a screen protector on your phone?

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Thursday, 11 May 2017 | MYT 4:00 PM Google promises Android O beta soon Google promises to boost device battery life with Android O. — AFP Relaxnews After making a first version available to developers at the end of March 2017, Google is gearing up to offer owners of Nexus (latest generations) and Pixel devices a first beta edition of the upcoming version of its Android mobile operating system.  Google says that the beta testing phase for Android Nougat has now ended and that a beta version of Android O will be available soon. The Android beta website will be updated soon when the Android O beta program begins. While Android O is expected to be officially unveiled at the Google I/O conference, held at the Shoreline Ampitheatre in Mountain View, California, May 17 to19, 2017, many of its new features have already been seen in the version currently being tested by developers. For starters, Google promises to boost device battery life with Android O by restricting the activity of applications running in the background, making them more power-efficient and less battery-draining. A new autofill function will be able to store data such as usernames, passwords, addresses or credit card details and automatically fill out forms. Plus, the update brings "Picture in Picture" (PiP) display capabilities for watching a video while using other apps alongside. Android O overhauls notifications too, allowing developers to create themed notification channels, grouping alerts from various apps so users can decide which ones they receive. In general, users will have greater control over notifications and which ones they want to see displayed onscreen. The number of notifications per app will also be displayed, as in iOS. Another visual change comes in the form of adaptive icons, matching the icon style to a user's particular version of Android, with more rounded or square icon designs in the various manufacturer interfaces. This latest version of Android is expected to land in Google's latest Pixel smartphones before progressively rolling out from fall this year. Google is yet to announce which sweet snack will lend its name to the latest OS. After Android KitKat, Lollipop, Marshmallow and Nougat, could it be time for an Android Oreo? Google I/O, runs from May 17 to19, 2017 in Mountain View, USA.

Owlchemy Labs, makers of Job Simulator and Rick and Morty: Virtual Rick-ality, joins Google Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/05/10 5:18pm PDTMay 10, 2017 15 Plus 1 on G+ 16 Share on Facebook 34 Share on Twitter Total Shares65 Games Google News Videos Google and Owlchemy Labs are ready to get schwifty together, as the one has now eaten the other like so many Pac-Man dots on the field of VR games. Both companies made their coordinated announcements earlier today. Google has been expanding their VR efforts pretty aggressively recently, so it's not too surprising. Although Owlchemy has produced Android games in the past, as of yet none of their VR works have been for the platform. There is no doubt that in the nascent market of virtual reality games, Owlchemy is one of the better names to have risen. They're quick and prolific, having produced Job Simulator as a launch title for the Oculus and HTC Vive, as well as following the success up quickly with Rick and Morty: virtual Rick-ality. The studio claims, following a test of the DK1, they vowed never to look back to boring flat-screen games again, and their efforts in the genre have resulted in immediate recognition and praise. Alas, that the above Rick and Morty game is not for Android. Owlchemy Labs' products are among the best (and funniest) out there, so I don't think it's any surprise Google would have expressed an interest if they wanted to buy a VR content producer. The folks over at Owlchemy are very excited about the deal. I hope that the extra resources from being a part of the great Googopoly result in more good VR times for us as consumers. Let's hope we can see some of their games ported over to Daydream. Wubba lubba dub dub.

EXCLUSIVE: AndroidPolice.com's Nexus One Is Running Android 2.2 Froyo. How Fast Is It Compared To 2.1? Oh, Only About 450% Faster Artem Russakovskii Follow View All Posts 2010/05/11 7:41pm PDTMay 11, 2010 3 Plus 1 on G+ 583 Share on Facebook 10 Share on Twitter Total Shares586 Exclusives HTC News Nexus One (Passion) Article Contents 1 Upcoming Frozen Goodness 2 Froyo 2.2 Performance 2.1 Linpack 2.2 Linpack Scores 2.3 Froyo Linpack Score 3 Conclusion Upcoming Frozen Goodness Folks, we have a Nexus One. We also have Froyo. In fact, we have the two mixed together in the most delicious frozen-yogurty Android 2.2 kind of way you can imagine. Not much has been officially released by Google about Android 2.2 - probably less than any other release to date. We all have a hunch about some new features but Google wouldn't officially confirm or deny any of them, other than the one about Flash 10.1. They're saving it for May 19th-20th, and we're OK with that. However, one of our team members has been playing with a Nexus One running Froyo for about a week now, getting more and more visibly excited every day. Before we proceed, however, here's a quick picture to squelch any non-believers. These are not fakes and we will be playing with the phone on video very shortly. Yes, it runs Flash, and it runs it very well (we'll demo that separately but you can get the idea here). As you've seen it already, it has a new home screen menu but we won't talk about that today. Froyo 2.2 Performance Today, we would like to point out the results of some speed tests we've been running on Froyo, using a tool called Linpack. These results are so impressive, most likely due to the introduction of the long awaited JIT compilation into the kernel, that we felt they deserved immediate attention. Linpack Linpack for Android was specifically created to test the performance of Dalvik VM which, in short, is the heart and the brains of Android. The benchmark calculates how fast your phone can operate, which can then be used to compare various phone models' relative performance. Linpack allows users to publish these results to its online tracker, but we'll talk about that a bit later. Here's a brief introduction to Linpack by the authors themselves, with interesting parts bolded: The LINPACK Benchmarks are a measure of a system’s floating point computing power. Introduced by Jack Dongarra, they measure how fast a computer solves a dense N by N system of linear equations Ax = b, which is a common task in engineering. The solution is obtained by Gaussian elimination with partial pivoting, with 2/3*N3 + 2*N2 floating point operations. The result is reported in Millions of FLoating-point Operations Per Second (MFLOP/s, sometimes simply called FLOPS). This test is more a reflection of the state of the Android Dalvik Virtual Machine than of the floating point performance of the underlying processor. Software written for an Android device is written using Java code that the Dalvik VM interprets at run time.  What is the purpose of this app? This is a simple benchmark test to show performance relative to other phones for a standard calculation.  Linpack has been used for years on all types of computers, with a version used to rate the TOP500 computers in the world. What speed is better? A higher number is better. Does having faster speed improve the android phones or what? Yes, it should.  The Dalvik VM has a huge impact on the Linpack number.  A better number on the same device would indicate that a new version update has improved performance.  Or it could show that something has gone terribly wrong if the number goes down. But enough about Linpack - let's take a look at how Froyo performs. Linpack Scores Just so you have an idea of the kind of scores you can expect from the benchmark, let me list a few sample numbers: the Nexus One running Android 2.1 gets about 6.5-7 MFLOPS my HTC Hero averages a measly score of about 2 MFLOPS (the phone is pretty slow indeed) Here is a screenshot of the last test I ran on the Hero: Froyo Linpack Score So how does the Nexus One with Froyo do? A whopping 37.5 MFLOPS. Think about this for a second. 37.6, compared to 6.5-7 - that's about a 450% speed improvement. Conclusion Things are starting to finally come together. Flash and huge performance gains, all in the same release. Flash is CPU hungry, so Android makes everything about the environment more efficient. Do you see it? Adobe wasn't giving Apple what they needed, and Apple wasn't giving Adobe, well, anything. But Google thought of the problem outside the box, like the ingenious engineers to the core that they are and made Android so much faster than it could finally run full Flash without a hitch. Oh yeah, the phone is indeed noticeably faster. Some of you (like Cyanogen and Uhhhh) pointed out that JIT compilation only helps programs that are not compiled to native code, which Flash and some video codecs/drivers seem to be. Thank you for this clarification. While real-life improvements will most certainly not be 450% across the board, we still expect the N1 and even Flash to benefit from JIT because, as other programs become more efficient, more CPU will be available to such natively compiled programs. These mysterious numbers from the Linpack Top 10 don't look so fake anymore now, do they? Tags android 2.1 Android 2.2 breaking exclusive froyo linpack performance subscribe ...

I've just downloaded Linpack, run it and got 4.761. I'm on AT&T network, but it shouldn't matter, right? I don't know how to get a screenshot on my Nexus, unfortunately. Artem Russakovskii Actually, I never said 2MFLOPS was on the N1 - it was on my HTC Hero. The N1 was 6.5-7MFLOPS. vkelman OK, my mistake. Hero image and Nexus 2.2 image are located together, and there is no Nexus 2.1 image nearby - it was easy to make a mistake in 3:00 am :) But then, why my is Nexus One so slow? (4.76 vs. 6.5-7) Artem Russakovskii Yeah, sorry for the confusion - didn't have the N1 image handy, so had to go with Hero only. Not sure why your N1 is so slow, perhaps it's running a bunch of stuff in the background? Brantyr Run the test again and again, takes a few runs to get everything cached for maximum speed. Putting it into aeroplane mode helps make sure the CPU isn't interrupted to respond to network traffic as well. And obviously make sure nothing else is running in the background. Vladimir Kelman Artem, is there some kind of limitation on a depth of the thread here? I wanted to reply to your image below, but it has no "Reply" link to me. Anyway, I rebooted my N1 phone and measured MFLOPS again. At first it gave me even less (about 4), but the next moment I measured it again and got 6 MFLOPS. So, it wary greatly, not sure - why. And yes, I have 3 security apps running in the background (Lockout, Wave Secure, and Mobile Defence) mainly because I couldn't choose one and trying to evaluate them. Salman Hasan My nexus one reads 6.8 MFLOPS. I Have not switched to airplane mode or anything. All I do is I use ES File Explorer and use the task manager to kill Applications; I have about 106 MB free on my RAM Harsha S Did U try 2.2 on HTC Hero. If not why not..? Try porting it to HTC Hero or Leak that ROM to some Devs..?? Would be a nice feeling to here that it runs on Hero too with higher MFLOPs.. what say..? Kr0nos The Screen is from the Hero. I hope 2.2 comes to my Magic // MT3G - by SuperF or cyanogen And I just flashed cyanogen 2.1 ROM yesterday :P Vanquish The score 2.009 MFLOPs is from his HTC hero, not from N1. Uhhhh So, fp operations are faster ... that's about all this says. Flash is very unlikely to be running within dalvik (it'd be running native under Linux) hence it'd be unaffected by these improvements... Artem Russakovskii Cyanogen pointed this out earlier today - as I'm not the biggest pro in low level Android implementation, I didn't know this - a correction/update will be posted ASAP. But such a boost in floating point operations is very important, don't you think? Think games and apps that will now be faster. Gambit Except, of course, that most games aren't implemented in Java (Well, *I* am, but I'm provably nuts) and those that are, don't use FP, they use fixed point mathematics. Sorry. Nexus One Forum Wow awesome testing. Will link to this post with a front page article tomorrow! Thanks. Sachin if this is true i will sell my iPhone on ebay piprog I would probably first compare apples to apples. Android is a Java platform, while iPhone OS is native. This current improvement most probably only means that Android performance was up until now so terrible, that such an improvement was possible (although respect to the engineers achieving it!), and is now approaching iPhone performance (from the rear, I suppose). JJJ What are you smoking piprog...??? I've got the latest iPod Touch and an HTC Incredible (do you even own an Android device?). I used to have a WinMo phone (Samsung Omnia) and I liked using the iPod Touch for email and browsing instead of my phone. However, now that I have the Incredible I use it for email and browsing since it's faster and does a better job than the iPod Touch...and that's with Android 2.1. piprog hi JJJ, the Incredible is state of the art, no arguments about that. Will be interesting how iPhone 4 with matching cpu and with the new iPhone OS 4 will stack up (performance wise; no chance feature wise, though), but it is true that now there is at least one Android phone that is a real contender, which is good for both platforms, I'd say :-) Jimlad lol piprog, apple os was designed for the hardware, considering that the iPhone has it's bollocks cut off to make it appear faster then it is a mighty thing that android is so much more capable and faster t'boot :p piprog hi Jimlad, more capable: sure (v.s. non-geek usability;-). But faster? Is there any conclusive evidence out there? Of course Incredible & co now has a much faster processor, but on similar hardware e.g. Safari seems to be faster. John Thompson Flash may not be directly dependant on FP operations, but it is a significant increase that will see the speed of many apps increase. Definitely great to see these behind the scene improvements coming with Froyo, bring on May 19th! tripplethrendo Will i be able to get 2.2 on the Eris? dextroz go back to sleep. you are just getting 2.1. eris will never got 2.2 since it's end of life is next month. cece Can you see if RAM usage also increased with JIT ?? Might be the problem with first gen phones with low RAM available. Jason Porter The way this test is done for MFLOPS is interesting for a "top of the stack" bench, but doesn't tell us much about the actual capability of the hardware. If you get a moment, can you see if it's possible to check the kernel log for the BogoMIPS value? On most linux systems this is at /var/log/messages but it may be somewhere odd on an Android system. BogoMIPS is evaluated for the processor(s) each time the kernel is loaded, and it's part of the default output log. It's not a particularly meaningful number in terms of application performance, but it will give a degree of comparability for the hardware itself. Frank Downloaded linpack for my Nexus One and got MFLOPS 6.691 Richard Great! If Android Police has a build of Android Froyo, can they spoil the other features of Android Froyo before it releases? Grashalm The Just in Time Compiler is awesome stuff. I always thought they have it already ;-) Desktop Java was known to be really slow, but then came the JIT and benchmarks were somewhere near C++. Not directly compiling to native code is great, since it enables performance optimizations even for already (bytecode) compiled applications. Also it can leverage all the target CPU options without recompling. (Mobile CPUs compared to desktop CPUs are pretty different) Oscar Maybe the increased performance of floating point operations are due to android finally being able to access the NEON and VFPv3 instrucions on the Snapdragon (called VeNum)? If that's the case, flash, video decoding and everything else will run better as well. Rogerio This is the iPHONE Killer! zeagus Oh, hey, there's this bridge I have for sale... phutwo These numbers are really low. Even if you don't use SIMD/Neon for floating point operation, you should be roughly 1 MFLOP per 1 MHertz. So for this phone it should say 1000 MFlop. Jason Porter This isn't a measure of the hardware's performance. This is a Java-specific benchmark used to measure the actual (observable) performance of the entire software stack, including the Dalvik VM. Remember, this is LinpackJava customized for Android, not Linpack in the traditional sense. If they were running real Linpack (in C) compiled for the underlying linux kernel, they'd be far closer to the hardware and these numbers would be much higher. Eamon Nerbonne ...and in any case it's simply not true that a 1MHertz processor can run linpack at 1mflop - even under the best of circumstances. Not all processors run 1 flop in 1 cycle (commonly, they don't) - some require extra latency between dependant read/writes, then there's the memory bandwidth and latency issues. It could also well be *faster* on a superscalar architecture with multiple ops in flight. Instruction mix can be a problem. In short, with a 1mhertz processor, you'd have an estimate for the order-of magnitude - but if you scored just 0.01Mflop on a 1MHertz machine, that might be odd, but not necessarily inconceivable. So yeah, using a 1GHz cpu and scoring 6-7 mflop in java on a phone running a GUI and network stack etc. that's not designed or optimized for linpack... ...is entirely reasonable, and not necessarily indicative of other performance metrics. phutwo So I was quite interested in why the numbers are so low (JVM+JIT is close to C). In x86, a fully-pipelined FPU, you can get 90% of theoretical performance depending on cache speed/size (or a factor of 2 if you don't have fused multiply/add). However, I stand corrected. Cortex A8 has an unpipelined floating point coprocessor! The VFP takes 18-21 cycles for an FMAC. So for a 1GHz processor, 40MFlops. So wow, if they are using the VFP in the JIT, they're hitting theoretical numbers and the interpreter/Java is free (bottleneck is fpu)! xvigour sorry but what you say is untrue, or I don't get your point. a core i7 (and cores before) is 4 flops/cycle. and a linpack can be 90+% efficient. so 1flops/cycle is easily reached. check the http://www.top500.org to be convinced Brantyr 37/7 ~= 520% not 450 (maybe leave the maths to the CPU :P)! Any way you slice it it's a crazy increase in speed, even running a JIT hack on cyanogenmod my Magic only goes from 2 to 3.6 MFLOPS - a rather paltry 180% increase in comparison!!! Artem Russakovskii Brantyr, 37/6.75 is about 550% but since we mention "faster", the original 100% is not counted, producing 450%. Think about what "100% faster" would mean and you'll see what I'm talking about. Brantyr Whoops, I see what you mean now, sorry! dj any noticeable changes to battery life under 2.2? have they reduced the amount of power needed by Android or is that just wishful thinking?? Artem Russakovskii Unfortunately, we cannot discuss this at the moment. You guys will probably have to wait until Google publicly announces Froyo. dj yeah, I thought that might be the case. thanks anyway Adam It's worth pointing out that Flash is not exactly the CPU hog, it is rich content in general. Look at some of the HTML5 demos on the Nexus One and let me know how that goes. I'll give you a hint, choppy typically (same, worse really, for the apphole product). So yes Flash does use a large amount of CPU but it is more based on the content being pushed through the application and not the application itself. Now if they opened up hardware decode for Ogg and h.264 we'd see some wicked fast stuff (not to mention better battery) Somebody Actually, flash IS just a turd. Try this: Measure CPU usage doing something with flash, and then measure CPU usage doing the *same thing* with native code. See the huge discrepancy? Flash is just a SLOW, UGLY memory hog, and has no place in this world. You can be assured that if flash shipped with AOSP or anyone's build of AOSP that I was interested in trying out, I would quite intentionally DELETE that component. Adam Nice job giving concrete examples. Further on the phone nothing is Native. If by native you mean C or other compiled code without a VM then of course it will run faster. If I have an API to the hardware for decoding for example (something safari did but other did not until now on the Mac) I would run faster. The whole notion of a VM implies things will not run as fast, you don't get abstraction for free. This is the issue with Droid itself half the time. Is there room for improvement in flash, yes, is flash a pig compared to similar products for the web, find me a similar product and we can talk b/c right now HTML 5 in the majority of the browsers is a pig too. Mike Will the Incredible with HTC sense be upgradable to froyo? Artem Russakovskii We don't have any information confirming this but I think it would be silly to assume that one of the newest and most powerful phones will not be supporting the next version. There are problems with HTC Sense and JIT that are currently present in custom ROMs but I'm sure HTC has been hard at work making the 2 compatible. Paul The CPU on the Hero is a dog, of course the number is lower. The 1 gig snapdragon is the fastest chip out there on a Android phone. michael hill How do I get my Droid to get a score like the one on the top 10. Right now I am averaging 4.5. I want 33. Please let me know. Thank u Adam Nabi Buy a new phone? How do I get my Fiat Punto to score like a Formula F1? Please let me know. Thank u Noodles Did you test to see if the new Nexus One will have a screen reader built in? Could a blind person use it without buying Steel or Standard Android, both of which don't allow users to text, email or surf the web? Sean Run the Sprint HTC Hero with an OC'ed 2.1 rom and JIT and you are looking at 4.8 MFLOPS Artem Russakovskii But no Sense, and I like my Sense (they're currently not compatible with each other, I believe). Sean Don't get me wrong I love Sense but I am finding way's around it. Artem Russakovskii Oh yeah? Is it noticeably faster? In which areas? Sean The boot time is faster, loading and unloading of apps is quicker. I mean it's not like going to a snapdragon cpu but sometimes just that little extra speed helps, like when opening cam to shoot something. The main thing is the OC'ed cpu though. Running nice at 767Mhz. Dody Suria Wijaya This is also can be interesting to compare mobile phone processors vs standard desktop/laptop cpu. Using linpack at this address: http://www.netlib.org/benchmark/linpackjava/LinpackJava.zip I got the following score (Intel T7500 2.2 GHz c2d) Mflops/s: 228.889 Time: 0.0 secs Norm Res: 1.43 Precision: 2.220446049250313E-16 or about 32x improvement over NexusOne :D Vidit Bhargava So...does wireless-n and FM radio get enabled when you installed Froyo? Dave Just ran the test on my N1. Getting 6.3 MFLOPS with everything still running in the background. CANT WAIT for 2.2!!! dave ran test on my desire 8.9 first run then 9.2 second run bring on 2.2 dave sorry it was 6.9 then 7.2 John Thompson I'd also love to see FM radio - hopefully if it isn't in stock 2.2, cyanogen will include it in his mod in the near future Max i'm still waiting for 2.1 on my HTC Hero...sigh Jason Porter I'm getting ~4.5 MFLOPS consistently on my Motorola Droid (standard 2.1, Verizon build). I'm very interested to see what JIT would do for this phone. Roach But the GUI is still ugly and the apps still suck. It's like having a fast Chevette. Somebody No, you're thinking of that fruity phone. This is ANDROID. j maz How can you download it? electronic cigarette Dude that type of speed is super promising. Bye bye iphone ;) prouddesireowner Hi, just read the thread...that's awesome! Did you get a chance to see if the apps2sd issue has been addressed yet? I'd love to see that fixed in froyo! --Android rules!-- Thomas I am also interested about Apps to SD. Thanks Quoth According to the issue tracker the status of that particular issue has been changed to 'FutureRelease', which means it's done and just needs to be released (http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=1151), presumably in Froyo. Claudio Ibarra I don't doubt the photo or the performance increase, but I have a question: If the photo reads "37.593" and the Linpack top 10 shows a range of 33.416 to 80.796, shouldn't one of the entry rows read "37.593" ? Artem Russakovskii Only if you specifically save it to their online db. Fábio I got 6.8 MFLOPS on my Android2.1/HTC Desire. Can't wait for the update!!!! ^_^ Fábio I got 6.9 MFPS on my HTC Desire / Android 2.1. And wow can't wait for the 2.2 update polkadots I cannot help but notice that the Droid did pretty darn well at about 34 MFLOPs for a 550+Mhz processor. I am using a Milestone but I reckon it should get about the same performance boost. Froyo!! Can't wait!! Đức Thành Hello, I'm from the futured. Here almost 5 years have passed, now we have phones with quad and octa-cores clocked at 2.6GHz and more to come soon. We have come so far. :DD Joshua So is the the thing that one of the exiting programmers said would "blow us away". I mean it's great and everything but i'm not sure it really has the "blow me away" factor considering that i really like the speed of my nexus one to begin with. I'm really interested in what's gonna be the best improvement jasim does any one know if it include arabic support? Priya That sounds weird. Anyways, now m interested to know if its faster then iPhone 4? Tetsuo I am not sure if Iphone 4 has a similar benchmarking tool, it would be nice to do a comparison, but Froyo is breathing new life to my old HTC Hero.. ;) It is clocking 4.17 MFlops on it running a custom rom ;) RoyBatty I just found another benchmark for Java performance on Android: caffeinemark. The great thing is that you can see how Froyo improves the results for a wide range of devices/ROMs ... on this website : http://www.flexycore.com/benchmark-database-access.html IT Rush Amazing, maybe I'll consider updating to this cool device asap.. Looks very interesting really! Dextroz Are you kidding me? This post is from a year ago! The Nexus One is now rocking Gingerbread 2.3. Do yourself a favor and get a Nexus S at this point instead. Đức Thành I'll take this opportunity to remind the both of you to get a Nexus 6 now instead, if you haven't already. :P IT Rush Wow, what an improvement.. can't wait to get one. Looks like it's time to drop my other phone and switch to this one eh. kia nice page I have learn a lot from this page very nice Đức Thành I'm thinking the same thing. kristen well its is faster then i.4 looks to me and but i.5 steels the race Jasa animasi flash Its fastest than iphone 4 wow its great pranav LINPACK benchmark helps a lot .. indeed xiaoying <div>Windows 7 tidlig vedtagelse beats Vista's 2 til 1</div> <div>I fem måneder siden dens udgivelse, har Windows 7 erobrede to gange de forbrug andel som  levis 501 sin forgænger, Vista, nås i den samme tidsperiode, et Web metrics selskab sagde i dag.Ifølge NetApplications.com i Aliso Viejo, Californien, Windows 7 tegnede sig for 9% af alle levis jeans uk  operativsystemer i levis commuter jeans   brug online for måned til sidste søndag.

Hongkiat.com Main Menu Design / Dev Technology Inspiration Social Commerce All Deals Search Hongkiat for: Reveal Search Form Reveal Off-canvas Navigation Google I/O 2017 – What to Expect Published by Sia, in Internet — May 11, 2017May 11, 2017 From May 17th to May 19th, Google will be holding its annual I/O event at the Shoreline Amphitheatre at Mountain View, California. As is tradition, the event will begin with a keynote by Google itself that will most definitely involve the company’s new products, apps and service. 10 Projects Showing Google Has The Future Figured Out 10 Projects Showing Google Has The Future Figured Out Have a question? Ask Google. You can say that Google is the best search engine out there and…Read more Unsurprisingly, Google is keeping most of its announcements close to its chest, but that doesn’t mean we aren’t able to speculate what may occur at the keynote. So without further ado, here’s what I believe Google may reveal at the I/O Keynote. Android O We begin our I/O Keynote speculation with a topic that will most certainly be the main focus of the presentation: Android O. Long since available as a Developer Preview, the I/O Keynote will be the first time Google officially reveals Android O to the general public. It is also likely that the company would reveal the proper name for its upcoming OS as well, with Android Oreo being the most common guess. Name revealing aside, expect Google to go into details as to the new features that Android will be getting with Android O. You can expect an estimated release date for Android O as well. The new Pixel smartphones It isn’t too surprising to find out that Google is hard at work on Pixel 2, considering the fact that the Pixel and the Pixel XL are two smartphones that are constantly in high demand. Thus far, rumours have indicated that the company is preparing three variants of the Pixel 2, codenamed “walleye”, “muskie”, and “taimen”. Where “walleye” and “muskie” are stated to be the successor to the Pixel and the Pixel XL, the “taimen” is widely rumoured to be a phablet-sized device. Other information on the Pixel 2 that has been leaked so far indicates that the phones will all sport the Snapdragon 835 SoC, waterproofing, an improved chipset and camera, and, unfortunately, the absence of a headphone jack. The Pixel 2 will also be retaining its premium price tag, so those expecting a much more affordable device may be disappointed. Considering the fact that the devices are currently scheduled for a late 2017 launch, it is highly unlikely that Google will reveal much about the devices. As such, I’m fully expecting Google to merely tease the existence of the Pixel 2 rather than revealing it outright. Google Assistant First revealed at Google I/O 2016, Google’s own digital assistant will most likely be the second billing in the company’s Keynote presentation after Android O. So what can one expect from the Google Assistant part of the presentation? Seeing as Google Assistant is finally being rolled out to some non-Pixel Android smartphones, I expect Google to give more information as to the devices and manufacturers that will be receiving this particular feature. With Google Assistant now being available on smartphones, chat apps (Allo), Android Wear 2.0 smartwatches and the Google Home speaker, I fully expect Google to announce that its digital assistant would be expanding to other platforms such as Android TV. Google Home and the smart home ecosystem The Google Home speaker was pretty much Google’s first attempt to enter the smart home market, so it would make sense that Google may be planning more devices to push the concept even further. While it is hard to say if Google would decide to push out new devices to complement the pre-existing speaker, rumours are going around that Google may announce a new version of the Google Home speaker that combines both the speaker and a Wi-Fi router. Other than that, Google would decide to introduce a more affordable version of the Google Home smart speaker to compete with Amazon’s own Echo Dot, but that’s pure speculation on my part. Google Daydream & Tango There’s is very little I can speculate when it comes to the Google Daydream VR platform considering the fact that the platform has thus far been supported by only a handful of devices. Apart from announcing more phones that will be Daydream-ready at the Keynote, Google could also reveal a revised edition of the Daydream View headset at I/O. Moving on, we come to Tango, an AR platform that gets even less attention than Daydream. Considering the fact that Microsoft has been heavily pushing mixed reality as of late, I expect Google to shed some light as to the future of its own augmented reality platform. Android Wear Android Wear is in a rather interesting position because even though Android Wear 2.0 was first announced at Google I/O 2016, the platform has only been rolled out to smartwatches in early 2017. As such, I don’t see Google announcing an Android Wear 3.0 at the Keynote. If there were to be an announcement to be made with regards to Android Wear, I speculate that it would only be some medium-sized updates at best. Everything else Outside of the topics mentioned above, it is possible that Google may announce something entirely new at the I/O Keynote. Seeing as little has been leaked as to what Google may be planning for I/O 2017, there aren’t many rumours that indicate that Google may be announcing something new at the event. That being said, I speculate that the company may announce a new app or two during the event, just like it did last year with both Allo and Duo. 15+ Front-end Development Conferences to Attend in 2017 15+ Front-end Development Conferences to Attend in 2017 The conference season is just around the corner, so let us present you with a guide to 2017's…Read more © 2007‐2017 Hongkiat.com (HKDC).

COMMENT The B2B companies that succeed in the modern market will be those that understand the lines between consumer and enterprise are blurring and apply lessons from the B2C sphere in their own approach Nick Ismail One of the most powerful things about Google is its simplicity. Google.com is a essentially a white page with a search box, and it was this simplicity that laid the groundwork for the company to take over the world. In fact, many of the technologies that have shaped the digital age—Google, Facebook, iPhones—are distinguished by their intuitiveness. iPads are literally easy enough for toddlers to use. As consumers became accustomed to these types of user experiences, they began to expect, even demand, interfaces that are similarly simple yet engaging in all aspects of their lives. Enterprise software is no exception. No one taught users how to use Google or Facebook, so why should anyone need a certification to use B2B software? >See also: How to implement personalisation into B2B support services It was this basic idea that set off the “consumerisation of the enterprise” trend, which has redefined the way software is designed over the past five years. Today, ease-of-use is a key competitive differentiator for all enterprise software, from payroll to big data, and across a range of industries. For instance, Box grew into a billion dollar juggernaut with its consumer-friendly approach to enterprise cloud storage. Slack transformed office communication and collaboration by applying design principles of social messaging to the workplace. These companies did not build groundbreaking technology—they succeeded because they understood that user-centric design meant users who were more engaged and productive. Studies have shown that easy to use consumer interfaces see higher adoption rates and better ongoing engagement. It’s hardly a surprise that people are drawn to products that aren’t complicated or confusing. B2B users are also consumers, and thankfully, convoluted B2B interfaces are becoming thing of the past. However, there are sectors, like real estate, that have not yet realised the full potential of this trend. Many of the most common software tools still have interfaces that are difficult and/or unpleasant to navigate. The grace period for these types of experiences is drawing to a close. To succeed in today’s market, B2B developers need to take a B2C approach. >See also: Harnessing machine learning to drive B2B relationships B2B products are feature rich, so how can they be easy to use? One of the reasons why Google is able to maintain such a clean homepage is that it provides one, straightforward service: search. B2B products, on the other hand, tend to come with a whole suite of features, so one could make the argument that it’s not realistic for enterprise products to adhere to the same standard of simplicity. However, there is a steep cost for having a complex feature rich interface if people don’t use the product. The most well thought out, valuable features can’t serve anyone if they can’t be found or figured out. Applying a B2C user experience design to a B2B application will streamline engagement and minimise learning curves. There are a number of ways to go about this. Advanced design tactics can reveal key features in an on-demand fashion that pleases users and helps keep your main interface simple. For example, outlining the most crucial things that someone needs to do to perform a task in the least number of steps. Or, segmenting the mobile experience to web experience, so only the most important and core actions are available on mobile, but the full experience of tweaking and customisations — like uploading a html email template, setting up full organisation security settings, or custom api and integrations—still push users towards web features. Another example is to utilise mobile experiences to minimise the screen with experiences that you have to click on the web, like swiping left and right or scrolling down. In the case of Google Maps, users have to shake the phone to do a bug report. >See also: Bringing meaning to personalisation in the context of B2B selling Also keep in mind that in a mobile-first world, user interfaces are forced to be simple. It’s now the norm for people to work on-the-go, whether they have office jobs or spend time out in the field. Enterprise products need to have a mobile presence to account for this increasingly mobile workforce, and that means paring down. Screen sizes on mobile devices are dramatically smaller than a desktop user experiences, so developers have to focus on key user interactions. Less space means every pixel precision matters. Rapid development cycles are key to innovation The typical B2B product development cycle happens in 3-6 month intervals, but the world keeps on moving faster and faster. People now want instant, in-the-moment, on-demand gratification for all things. They are used to consumer platforms that roll out new products and features and updates on what feels like ongoing basis. This puts pressure on businesses to speed up their development cycles. If customers are clamouring for a particular feature or have a complaint about an existing product, B2B companies need to address those needs for risk losing their customers to competitors. >See also: How forward-thinking companies are reinventing the role of the customer This pressure can be stressful, but it’s also an opportunity. Rapid development cycles force enterprises to listen closely to the needs of their customers and constantly iterate. Consumer demand can lead B2B companies to push new products monthly, if not weekly. This requires a flexible product roadmap that evolves with customer feedback cycles and an agile structures that allow organisation to adapt. The B2B companies that succeed in the modern market will be those that understand the lines between consumer and enterprise are blurring and apply lessons from the B2C sphere in their own approach.   Sourced by Matt Murphy, creator and chief marketing officer at Chime   Nominations are now open for the Tech Leaders Awards 2017, the UK’s flagship celebration of the business, IT and digital leaders driving disruptive innovation and demonstrating value from the application of technology in businesses and organisations.

Is this the case or should I be backing it up as well? Andrew It’s very handy to have files synchronised with online services such as Google Drive, Dropbox, Microsoft OneDrive, Apple iCloud, Flickr or whatever. You should be able to retrieve most or all of your photos if your smartphone or laptop breaks or is lost or stolen. However, you can never assume that your data is safe, whether you’re asking about cloud services, network servers, PCs, smartphones, USB hard drives, thumb drives, SD cards, or CD-Rom, DVD or Blu-ray discs. I might make an exception for stone tablets, but they are not practicable for storing photos and videos. You may have come across Schofield’s Second Law of Computing, which states that data doesn’t really exist unless you have at least two copies of it. Today, I’d add a corollary: backups don’t really exist unless you have at least three on different media in different places, and deleting one must not affect any of the others. That syncing feeling But you must understand how the synchronisation works. If you delete a file on your local device, does that delete the same file in the cloud? (Which folders are synchronised and which ones aren’t?) Further, are the files on your device really files or are they placeholders – merely links to a file that is actually somewhere else? A few years ago, Ovi Demetrian provoked a lot of discussion when he posted a website, Google Drive Sucks: “I lost years of work and personal memories that I saved as Google Docs files because of a poor user interface,” he wrote. He’d moved his “files” out of the Google Drive folder on his PC, not realising that they were only links. When Google told him he was running out of Google Drive space, he went online and emptied the trash folder … which promptly deleted his files. The reverse used to happen a lot. Someone would install Google Drive on a PC, drop some files in its folder, see them upload, then delete the files. If they went online, of course, the files weren’t there. (Uploading files manually via web interfaces works as you’d expect.) There’s an even scarier story on Reddit: How we lost over €6,000 by not understanding Google Drive. This is about the way file ownership works in the Google Apps suite. Briefly, you have a file, but you can’t access it because the account that created has been closed. People also get caught out by local file synchronisation. For example, I set up an external hard drive (EHD) that syncs with the data on my PC’s hard drive. Great: all my new files are backed up. But if I accidentally delete a file or folder on my PC, the sync program will delete it on the EHD as well. That is one reason why I have a second EHD to back up my backup. I do that manually using FreeFileSync so I can scroll through the list of files to be copied and deleted, looking for the unexpected. Another reason is the threat of ransomware, which encrypts files on PCs and holds them hostage. Smart ransomware also encrypts any files it finds on EHDs and in cloud drives. Triage your files Not all files are equal. Some are irreplaceable, such as family photos, and some would be hard to replace, such as your half-finished PhD thesis/blockbuster novel or a decade’s accounting data. Many other files are easy to replace, probably without charge. You may be able to re-download music files, for example, or just reinstall an operating system or application. You can enhance your backup strategy by keeping vital files together in one folder that you can back up without having to back up your whole PC. Windows tries to help by creating special folders for documents, downloads, music, pictures and videos. (This also helps protect them from other users.) However, you can create your own separate hierarchy with the subfolders you need – photos, work, taxes, medical records etc. The idea is to assemble a relatively small set of important files that you can back up quickly while avoiding the rubbish. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Don’t rely on a single cloud service for backup purposes, and be wary of relying on two. Photograph: Chris Clor/Getty Images/Blend Images RM Ideally, your vital data should fit on a convenient storage format. If you only have 700MB, it will fit on a CD-Rom. If you have 4.7GB, it will fit on a DVD. You can get 50GB (single-layer) or 100GB (dual-layer) on a Blu-ray disc. Facebook uses vast numbers of Blu-ray discs for backups. EHDs can hold 8TB nowadays, though smaller EHDs are more affordable. For example, you can buy a 3TB drive for around £100. That should have room for both a conventional, incremental backup and an unencrypted, uncompressed copy of your folder of important files. I still like optical discs because they are cheap, and you can easily make multiple copies. That makes it easy to keep backups “off site” in a garden shed, an office drawer, or at a trusted friend’s house. Also, optical discs are invulnerable to ransomware. Cloud options There are a few specialised cloud-based backup services such as Carbonite, SugarSync and Mozy, but they cost more than using your own EHD, and it can take a long time to do a complete backup. The Wirecutter reckons CrashPlan is the best, though BackBlaze is also worth a look. General-purpose cloud drives such as Google Drive, OneDrive and Dropbox are best for sharing small-ish files between devices or with a few friends, but not ideal for backup purposes. You may be able to use one or preferably two to store copies of your vital files, but if you have more than about 2GB, you may have to pay. Google Drive costs $19.99 a year for 100GB or $99.99 for 1TB. Dropbox costs £79 a year for 1TB. Microsoft Office 365 Personal provides 1TB of OneDrive storage for £59.99 a year, but the best deal is Office 365 Home with Premium OneDrive. For £79.99 a year, five users get 1TB each, as well as full Microsoft Office software on their PCs and Macs, and apps on their smartphones and tablets. However, note that there are other hazards with cloud storage, such as being locked out of your mailbox and/or cloud drive by the supplier or by a passing hacker. And, obviously, you can’t access online files when you don’t have an internet connection. At this stage, I wouldn’t rely on a single cloud service for backup purposes, and I’d be wary of relying on two. But I strongly recommend them as part of a backup strategy that includes other media in other places. For safety’s sake, make NAS servers, EHDs, optical discs etc – take your pick – part of the mix.

That’s the main takeaway from the new Executive Paywatch analysis by the AFL-CIO. The labor union federation dug into the compensation levels of CEOs of companies on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index. The average S&P 500 CEO pulled in $13.1 million last year, a 5.6 percent increase from 2015. Meanwhile, the average employee only made $37,362. Think about that: Your typical head honcho makes nearly as much in one day as his typical employee makes in a year. The compensation winners were the heads of corporate behemoths like Google, Charter Communications, Expedia, CBS, Nike, and Walt Disney. According to most recent data obtained by the AFL-CIO, Sundar Pichai, the CEO of Alphabet, Google’s parent company, is the country’s highest paid executive: He commanded more than $100 million in 2015. Next up was Charter Communications CEO Thomas M. Rutledge who raked in more than $98 million last year. In a stunning display of just how much investors despise labor cost increases, American Airlines ignited a firestorm on Wall Street late last month when it approved an 8 percent salary raise for its pilots and 5 percent raise for its flight attendants—an almost unheard development in recent years. One analyst complained in a letter to clients: “This is frustrating. Labor is being paid first again. Shareholders get leftovers.” Yet in 2015, American Airlines CEO Doug Parker made more than $11 million. The yawning pay gap between CEOs and workers has widened since the 1970s as the shareholder capitalism that rewards executives with huge raises, performance bonuses, and stock options and slashes employees’ salaries and benefits has become more entrenched. Productivity rates have increased right along with corporate profit margins, but the median income for American workers has stagnated while their bosses continue to systematically hollow out their health care and retirement benefits. All the while, CEOs aggressively push back on calls to bump up worker pay with fear mongering about widespread job losses and a new economic apocalypse if they were to sanction wage and salary hikes. Meanwhile, the Trump administration works tirelessly to ease tax rates for millionaires, billionaires, and corporations while ripping away affordable health care for everyone else. The president wants to dramatically reduce the 35 percent corporate tax rate under the guise of spurring economic growth. Yet research has shown that many companies pay nowhere near the top marginal rate, thanks to umpteen lucrative tax loopholes. Between 2008 and 2015, 18 Fortune 500 companies paid no federal taxes at all, according to a study by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy. Moreover, corporations like Apple, Pfizer, and Microsoft continue to stash tens of billions in profits abroad, avoiding an estimated $767 billion in taxation stateside. Trump wants to give those companies a generous tax holiday on their offshore profits as a way to entice investment in the United States. Previous corporate tax-cut proposals have never produced much economic growth. Companies typically don’t direct tax savings into research and development, capital improvements, or—you guessed it—higher pay for workers. Instead, lucrative bonuses incentivize CEOs to funnel those savings into stock buybacks that further enrich shareholders, creating an insular feedback loop that is one of the core driving forces in this ever-increasing CEO-worker pay gap. Bottom line? CEOs continue to get paid more and more by pushing workers’ wages lower and lower while their own salaries and perks increase year after year. For their unrivaled skill in exacerbating income inequality, the American CEO is our Trickle Downer of the Week. Tax Cuts for the rich. Deregulation for the powerful. Wage suppression for everyone else. These are the tenets of trickle-down economics, the conservatives’ age-old strategy for advantaging the interests of the rich and powerful over those of the middle class and poor. The articles in Trickle-Downers are devoted, first, to exposing and refuting these lies, but equally, to reminding Americans that these claims aren’t made because they are true. Rather, they are made because they are the most effective way elites have found to bully, confuse and intimidate middle- and working-class voters. Trickle-down claims are not real economics. They are negotiating strategies. Here at the Prospect, we hope to help you win that negotiation.

Brought to you in partnership with MongoDB. Back in October of 2016, I was at OpenStack Conference in Barcelona and ran into a longtime friend, Rob Hirschfeld. He surprised me by talking about a problem domain that we have had discussions about for years, reframing it as “the data center underlay problem.” His provocative statement was that while OpenStack solves many problems, it didn’t address the fundamental challenges of how to run things like OpenStack on actual physical infrastructure. This is a problem domain that is being radically redefined by the container ecosystem. This is a problem that Rob has been tirelessly working on for nearly a decade, and it was interesting to get his perspective on the emerging ecosystem, including OpenStack, Kubernetes, Mesos, containers, private clouds in general (which include Azure Stack), etc. I thought it would be useful to share this with everyone. For those of you who don’t know, Rob Hirschfeld is a longtime data center automation advocate with a history of blogging about open source, DevOps, and Lean Process at robhirschfeld.com. He’s served four terms on the OpenStack board, started the Kubernetes Cluster Ops SIG and co-founded the open Digital Rebar hybrid provisioning project. He’s also known as @zehicle online, and is currently the CEO of RackN. Gene Kim: Tell me about the landscape of docker, OpenStack, Kubernetes, etc. How do they all relate, what’s changed, and who’s winning? Rob Hirschfeld: Containers have dramatically altered the IT landscape because they combine improved distribution/packaging models with improved performance and efficiency. These dual benefits are highly disruptive to platforms built assuming virtualization (like OpenStack, SDN and SAN vendors). They are also highly disruptive to platforms that assumed slow or controlled software distribution processes (like Chef, Puppet or Cloud Foundry). Even hardware vendors and cloud providers will be impacted because the smaller footprint of containers drives towards commodity hardware and frustration with the “VM tax.” While very exciting, containers create a management challenge for users and operators. Since they are short lived and rapidly regenerated, keeping track of containers through a development pipeline and into production requires sophisticated automation such as Kubernetes, Docker Swarm, Mesos, Rancher or other platforms. These platforms also expose gaps in software defined storage (SDS) and networking (SDN). Ironically, OpenStack’s rocky progress in these areas will likely be scavenged to accelerate their successor. There are real developer productivity and operational efficiency gains from containers, and the benefits are accelerating. I expect to see a wave of security and monitoring improvements that will make container packaging required in the near term. That progress comes at the expense of VM platforms like OpenStack. GK: I recently saw a tweet that I thought was super funny, saying something along the lines “friends don’t let friends build private clouds” — obviously, given all your involvement in the OpenStack community for so many years, I know you disagree with that statement. What is it that you think everyone should know about private clouds that tell the other side of the story? RH: The world is hybrid, everyone needs to adjust. Telling everyone to go to public cloud is equally silly — the reality is that each company and workload is different. RackN’s mission is to have our customers not care about which infrastructure runs their application. Part of that is making Google scale data center automation accessible to everyone AND part is making workloads portable. [GK note: I love the term for this: “GIFEE”: Google Infrastructure For Everyone Else] The problem with OpenStack and building private clouds/infrastructure is that we tried to layer complex software on top of inconsistently managed, heterogeneous infrastructure. Even if OpenStack had been amazingly easy to run (and it was far from it), the resulting clouds would have been inconsistent. In my opinion, OpenStack did not solve the real problems that were driving people to AWS. “Friends don’t let friends build private clouds without strong foundational process and automation” would be a better way to say it. Let’s help people do Ops better before we cloud-shame them. GK: We talked about how much you loved the book Site Reliability Engineering: How Google Runs Production Systems by Betsy Beyer, which I also loved. What resonated with you, and how do you think it relates to how we do Ops work in the next decade? RH: I strongly identify with operators who write software to improve Operations. The whole RackN team often feels like we are odd ducks because we care about data center operations and running infrastructure, not just pumping out software. The book really speaks and embraces that mentality as an important mindset. The book also establishes great ground rules. Justifying the 50/50 coding/Ops balance is critical because so many operators are underwater and cannot find time to improve. We really underestimate the importance of time and focus to improve. The book also does a good job talking about different types of Ops work and the importance of staying connected to running the applications and infrastructure. Most importantly, it humanizes Google’s Ops teams. Google made incredible investments in Operations. By sharing their lessons learned, we can build tools that focus on the right priorities. By explaining the value of their approach, we can explain why those tools are worth the investment. GK: Tell me what about the work you did with Crowbar, and how that informs the work you’re currently doing with Digital Rebar? RH: Crowbar was created at the dawn of OpenStack because my team at Dell had learned from other cloud efforts that installation was a system problem (this is a lesson repeated in the SRE book). We needed to three degrees of control: the full node from BIOS to application, between nodes to build cluster, and outside of nodes to interact with data center services like DNS, DHCP, NTP, and PXE. Crowbar, which is still in use by SUSE, was successful when it could fully control those elements. Unfortunately, no install ever allowed us to control all the elements, so Crowbar was way too brittle in practice. It also lacked the state machinery needed to do upgrades. It turns out that upgrades are much more important (and harder!) than installs. When we started over with Digital Rebar, we took a very different approach to the problem. We needed a design that could adapt to different site requirements, track state of a running system and make controlled incremental changes. We also wanted the platform to be much more transparent in how it was working so that mortals could troubleshoot issues in the field. Taken together, those are key SRE values. The resulting Digital Rebar platform is a mix of specialized orchestration (annealing), functional work units (roles), and API-driven services. These three aspects of the architecture work together to create a composable platform. That allows us to mix physical and cloud infrastructure, mix Chef, Puppet, Ansible and Bash, and mix different operating systems and hardware types. Most critically, the composable nature allows us to make incremental changes needed for upgrades. Of course, the system is API driven and deployed as microservice containers! We feel like Digital Rebar provides a solid foundation for SREs to build on. It allows them to (re)use open best-practice automation on their commodity gear. With those advantages, SREs can finally focus on the parts of their job that are actually different from other companies.

Franklin D. Roosevelt’s skillful use of radio in his day ensured the New Deal coalition, Abraham Lincoln’s use of the telegraph helped pave the way for Republican control of government. This trend still holds true today. The tech-left’s creative use of online movement building, coalition organizing, and millions in liberal foundation and Silicon Valley financing largely dominated the online political dialogue during the Obama years. But while radical netroots progressives have long paid lip service to an “open Internet” as an essential tool to ensure a free press and political transparency, their openness sophistry has always been a clever rhetorical head fake. The truth is they care nothing for Internet openness. For them, the end game is about Internet control. Control the Media As the Internet upended the advertising revenue model of traditional media in the last decade, the liberal foundations and uber-globalists quickly filled the vacuum. George Soros alone is said to have contributed more than $48 million to dozens of leftist investigative news outlets like ProPublica. Since 2006, the Ford Foundation has invested a stratospheric $288 million globally in media, $162 million of which has been invested in the U.S. – largely as part of its “media democracy” movement, a sophisticated activist movement comprised of social justice radicals and hard leftists intent on supplanting objective journalism with sophistry masquerading as legitimate news. Control the Internet’s Infrastructure In early 2015, President Obama passed rules regulating the internet for the first time in history. While leftist foundations were the primary financiers (Soros and Ford shoveled $196 million to so-called “open Internet” advocates) they were joined by Silicon Valley monopolies like Google and Facebook who opportunistically saw regulation as a way to further leverage their monopoly control of the Internet, in a bid ironically called “net neutrality.” It helped of course, that companies like Google seemed to own the Obama White House: Google officials visited the White House more than 425 times during Obama’s two terms, and more than 258 officials and executives spun through the Google-Obama revolving door during his two terms. Control the Platforms More than any other event, the 2016 election exposed the left’s “open Internet” charade for the fraud that it always was. In the closing months of the election, Silicon Valley companies prodded on by their leftist activist and liberal foundation allies launched an all-out assault on Trump supporters, banning Twitter users, censoring Facebook content and even allegedly manipulating Google search results and Google autocomplete to favor their preferred candidate and disfavor her opponent. Silicon Valley-owned mainstream outlets like Jeff Bezos’ personal blog The Washington Post published outlandish News of the World-style stories suggesting that Vladimir Putin poisoned Hillary Clinton — the supposedly real cause of her infamous collapse. Google and Facebook waded into the news process directly, declaring themselves arbiters of the truth by rolling out new “fact-check” features to debunk news stories that diverted from the official Google/Soros globalist narrative. Taking Back the Internet Into this fray marched a new breed of scrappy, rowdy, pugnacious activists that no one predicted. Soros’ henchmen and his Silicon Valley allies were caught flat-footed by a new group of real Internet freedom fighters. Armed with clever memes and immersed in Internet culture, this new conservative army used crowd-sourced activism, viral content, and humor to reach their audience. Today the same leftist “open internet” LARP’ers who championed internet freedom only two years ago have branded chilled-out frogs as hate symbols. Former presidential candidates even argue that conservative speech is not constitutionally protected. To keep the Internet truly free and open, Americans that support true internet freedom need to make their voices heard. This is the most important battle of our generation. It’s a fight against the tech-left, their corporate fellow travelers, and their big government allies working together to silence dissent and solidify their power once and for all. Join us in the fight to Free Our Internet. Christie-Lee McNally is the Director of Free Our Internet. Free Our Internet (www.freeourinternet.org) is a non-profit citizen group whose mission is to educate the public about how leftist super-elites and their powerful corporate allies in Silicon Valley have methodically used their wealth and political influence to erode the public’s internet freedoms and destroy alternative media. Our goal is to empower the public to fight back against the tech-left’s well-funded war to control our means of communication, information, organizing, and mobilizing: the internet. Free Our Internet and its supporters stand for free speech and expression online, protecting the diversity of ideas, and opposing government actions that undermine Internet openness and transparency.

The Play Store adopts new app and notification icons with v7.8.16 [APK Download] Cody Toombs Follow View All Posts 2017/05/10 6:25pm PDTMay 10, 2017 110 Plus 1 on G+ 272 Share on Facebook 98 Share on Twitter Total Shares480 Applications Downloads News Google never stops changing things up. A new version of the Play Store app is rolling out to users and it comes with a new icons for the app launcher and notifications. They're simple cosmetic adjustments, but these are the types of things you can't help but notice as soon as they're on your screen. Left: Old version. Right: New version. The new app icon leaves behind the last remnants of the shopping bag icon that came along when Google still called this the Android Market. It is now just the Google Play logo with no other ornamentation. It's worth noting that the round icon variant hasn't changed, so it still looks like the Google Play logo on a dinner plate. Above: Old version. Below: New version. The notification icons have also gone through a little facelift. These also trade away the tote bag motif for the Google Play triangle, but slightly adjusted with the checkmark extending beyond the lines. The notification icons come in different colors for each of the content stores (e.g. apps, books, movies). The notification icon for stacked updates – when more than one app is installed or updated – is no longer a stack of blocks, it's just the same triangle app icon used with single installs. We're still looking for more changes in this update, but it's starting to look like this may be it. If you don't want to wait for Google to send this update out to you, grab it from the APK Mirror link below. Download The APK is signed by Google and upgrades your existing app. The cryptographic signature guarantees that the file is safe to install and was not tampered with in any way. Rather than wait for Google to push this download to your devices, which can take days, download and install it just like any other APK.

They 'quickly' portray even to a naive what kind of app you will be clicking on, especially amid numerous numbers of apps. Marcelove .Google' employee : "Let's change an icon the people are used to and know for many years to something that doesn't improve anything." Google's executives : "Genius!” . Powsniffer0110 4.0 FTW Burak Çalık they are not triangles, its the play icon. leganzish What shape is a play icon? I forget. Hachiko Google play books was perfect with Android 5 but only this one... Android 6 version is almost perfect TechGuy22 New icon every year. They are going to change play Store soon too lol Total Insecurity How do you know that? boop Unless you mean the name, the app just got another design update. sbeaulieu Isn't that the same icon from a couple of years ago? Tom Westrick We've always been at war with Eastasia Captain_Invisible Yeah.. they've used that icon on and off in promotion for a while. 4Ui812 Looks like I'll have to wait until it gets pushed. Apkmirrior won't let me download it (I don't turn off my ad blocker for anyone :-) Gjorgi Lazarovski You can download even with the adblocker on. You just need to wait like 10 sec for the download button to show up. sklatigre Can confirm Cakefish And you get to admire a cool cat. Richard Branches The play store icon on google chrome is still the old one, they should update it as well... https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/bca1aca3fd5b60e08fcd507e7c39b67f23f70ed0e4ff417bcf62881906f7106a.png Тарас Мукин Chrome apps were announced to be removed soon. Don't think they are going to bother. Richard Branches You're right about that, but they still will be available on Chrome OS so why not update it anyway?... Curt Because Google. Spazturtle Won't they be replaced in Chrome OS by Android app support? Richard Branches No, they won't... Tom Westrick If they wait long enough it'll just be back to that logo C64 Thank god / satan (choose your preference) for icon packs Konrad Krawczuk Icon packs are always kinda problem to me. If you have a few without icon from icon pack you must always fight with inconsistency. Powsniffer0110 Yes! I'm too freaking anal about this so I cannot use icon pack​s :( xyz Neither. C64 Sorry forgot the Atheist Jose Romero Google IO can't come sooner. Devin Studios Looks kinda boring compared to the old icon. Breathless So wait what happened to circles?... Cody Toombs Circles are there on the Pixel and in any other situation where the round icons are chosen. The triangle icon shows up on everything else. Anton Kuznetsov Triangles is the new circles burkett375 Since they love to A/B test, make 7 different message apps, etc....they should make 3 competing app stores/markets/hubs Ben Godfrey Don't give them any "good" ideas ;) Marcelove It doesn't matter... Google's employees are paid to keep an eye here at AP ... But it must be chimpanzees, because even with the clear feedback about stupid decisions they got here, they still don't give a f*ck and keep the screw route. Sumeet Deshmukh People who paid a lot of money to Google aren't getting these icon updates, the pixel guys mattcoz Because our icons already dropped the shopping bag, no need for an update. Sumeet Deshmukh I was a little sarcastical, I love my pixel (styled rom on my Nexus 5 (not x) Victor Stuber ya, but we got crappy white circles around all our icons. It sucks Leon I like my circles personally. sklatigre Gonna miss the shopping bag notification, kinda liked it. global etest You can keep it easily by icon packs.. sklatigre Didn't know icon packs can change the notification icons also. Margaritas Ante Porcos Google is a mess in everything. Mr. DICKHEAD it was always a mess.. Berkay Anyone else dislike both the circled icon and just the icon by itself? I prefer the shopping bag... It looks the best IMO. Thomas I loved the Android Market icon. Made so much sense SavageJeep What is Android Market? /s Salis Before Google Play branding, the app store used to he simply called Android Market. NooSH it looks like crap and i'm glad they are getting rid of it. Berkay So you prefer a simple triangle over a shopping bag? It looks horrible lol. TheDrunkenClam Completely agree. Google's whole ad campaign about Android was "be together, not the same". And then they make literally all of their icons the same by putting them in boring white circles. All in an effort to copy apple. I love the different sized and shaped icons of Android. Not a good look, Google. Jesse Kawell Once you see that notification icon "checkmark" ✅ as a 3D post lying down at an angle, you can never unsee it. BoFiS Aww, that's sad, and almost unrecognizable now since I still call mine "Market" on my homescreen... Branko Proof that Google lost the plot. reCoded So, the circle icon is the same I guess? Martin Let me read the article for you: "It's worth noting that the round icon variant hasn't changed, so it still looks like the Google Play logo on a dinner plate." Anton Kuznetsov This localization of 'update all' button text is awful https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/57e6791db8965bf1e13f4f50e3b6b5b303644e9c3f1660799bf9896ed1ef57b3.png Exalm ОМГ. Это именно в новой версии вот так? Captain_Invisible That's your crazy language's fault. Vitias R. No it's not. Have a nice day. thunderqus Only if I can find what you are talking about in English and posting screen in "who knows which" language. Vitias R. It says "Update your apps right today". I think that "Обновить все" is enough. Konrad Krawczuk Why it is not something like "обновить все" ? YuCMi Jesus christ Google. What sin did the previous icon commit? Was it too old for you guys? Grey Very ugly and hard to understand. Not intuitive at all. But I guess that's Google 2017! Lawstorant Looks generic af. Really Google? WTF? Maybe just go back to HOLO then? DragoCubed The new icon is nice but the icon in the notification bar isn't so nice. The one thing I don't like about losing the bag is the icon not representing a store. xyz OMG! TRIANGLE! NO CIRCLE? Like if you don't give a flying F about icon shapes. LOL I want circle, niggа! LOL New icon! Fuсk YEAH! Paul Teale Not circular then, not really following their own guidelines are they Kieron Quinn The round icon is round, the non-round icon is not. They're following their guidelines just fine Erimaru What about round icon? Curt I actually like this icon the most. Martin Spierings I already got complaints from people that didn't identify the play store or play icon with app store. So how the hell would this help people? They should realize that most people don't understand the connection google is looking for. Play is used for movies/film or games, not apps. The bag-background at least gave some indication on what to expect. The new one will get lots of people (those not really experienced with Android or mobile in general) to get their apps from there. These things should be self explanatory. And Google should drop the Play name (plus icon). Its a stupid name already. avnow well I used to get this icon pack, not exactly but close to this with an icon pack, this icon looks crisp! //moumon Meh.. I'm still using Elta icon pack :v That's one of the reason why I love android... Customize to meet your expectations <3 jcopernicus Awesome. A play button for purchases! Makes sense! Ra1nb0wD4sh DE Press Start to shut down Windows. :D (Not relevant anymore, I know) Ruben Tavano On the lateral menu the apps section was in the old green and with this update it has been updated to match the new green of the whole play store Alexander Reddicks The icon has been updated to support the new "adaptive" icon style being showcased next week. https://developer.android.com/preview/features/adaptive-icons.html Mr. DICKHEAD This is dumb theres nothing new I like the bodybag version.. but the naked one alone? seriously..?! David Onter The new icon looks HUGE next to the others. It doesn't seem to follow the spacing guidelines? Marcelove Google' employee : "Let's change an icon the people are used to and know for many years to something that doesn't improve anything." Google's executives : "Genius!” Biga173rd They can't make up their minds. madmaglio Finally. I've been replacing the bag icon with my own version of this for years. so much cleaner. VirtualWave I kinda hate it, it looks overly large and gaudy. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/d5821ea6199d4b4d1b5b7fa7fb41a252ab810c809090eb00f133b88f741b1735.png Follow Android Police 1.49M 468k 143k 115k Latest Deals 4 [Deal Alert] Get the LG Urbane 2nd Edition for $171.99 on eBay 2017/05/11 8:04pm PDTMay 11, 2017 4 [Deal Alert] Get 10,000 Amazon Appstore coins for $65 ($35 off) through May 25th 2017/05/11 1:34pm PDTMay 11, 2017 27 T-Mobile to offer 'buy one, get one' deal on Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus starting tomorrow (May 12th) 2017/05/11 12:52pm PDTMay 11, 2017 7 [Deal Alert] Huawei Watch in Jewel/Pearl $220 at Amazon ($330 off) 2017/05/10 7:32pm PDTMay 10, 2017 30 [Update: Deal ended] [Featured Deal Alert] Caseology is offering its new cases for the Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus to Android Police for as little as $5.99 for a limited time [Sponsored] 2017/05/10 2:39pm PDTMay 10, 2017 Latest Poll Do you use a screen protector on your phone?

VMware AirWatch manages millions of Android devices today, across dozens of manufacturers, multiple “flavors” of Android OS, and hundreds of distinct Android devices being supported. Plus, AirWatch offers the most comprehensive support for latest Android security and management capabilities for businesses, enabling advanced Android security and separation of personal and work apps and data to meet the needs of even the most security conscious organizations. This close relationship between Google and AirWatch has contributed significantly to the penetration of Android in the businesses of all sizes. It’s only natural that VMware and Google should extend their relationship now to their rapidly growing Chromebooks. Today at Dell EMC World, VMware and Google announced an expanded partnership focused on accelerating Chromebook adoption. This expansion includes VMware Workspace ONE support for Chromebooks, enabling secure identity-based single sign-on (SSO) to any app on Chromebooks, including cloud services, internal web apps, and virtual Windows apps and desktops. We’re also collaborating on advancements to unify native Android applications. Chromebook growth has exploded over the past two years. According to an article published last week by PC World, Chromebook shipments surged from 6.8 to 9.4 million, or 39%, from 2015 to 2016. This growth is even more impressive when contrasted with the overall PC market which declined by over 6% during the same period according to Gartner. With Google stating that all new Chromebooks in 2017 will add support for Android applications, this growth is likely to be buoyed given Android’s commanding mobile device market share.

[Minority Report] Google and Coca-Cola may target personalized ads at you - in real life Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/05/10 11:27am PDTMay 10, 2017 23 Plus 1 on G+ 45 Share on Facebook 49 Share on Twitter Total Shares117 News Videos Google and Coca-Cola's partnership effort for in-store advertising displays looks to be bearing fruit. The advertising system uses DoubleClick's preference and tracking data combined with Google's Beacon Platform to serve up targeted ads by pulling data from passing smartphones. With that info, displays are able to select content based on your preferences in the form of advertisements specifically targeted to passersby. In a recent grocery store pilot program the Minority Report-style ads performed quite very well. This isn't actually that new. It was discussed at a few places in the last couple months since the details were revealed at Google's conference. But, it seems to have quite effectively flown under the radar for that time, considering how cool it is. Coca-Cola made a detailed post about it on one of their social promotion sites in April as well, in which they talked about the potential environments for these tracking signage systems, like movie theaters and other Retail venues than just grocery stores. Google's partnership with Coca-Cola for this system has been discussed off-and-on for a few years. Back at the National Automatic Merchandising Association's OneShow in 2016 Google talked about the potential as applied to vending machines, and said that Google and Coca-Cola were working together on Bluetooth beacons for vending, but this is the first time I've actually gotten to see what it looks like and how it performs. Coca-Cola's Greg Chambers, at Google's recent Cloud Next Conference, said that it has been experimenting with small tests into proximity marketing since at least 2015 when they first started working with Google on a prototype. The two companies tested things with a pilot for the system in 250 Albertson's grocery stores, in which Coca-Cola saw some incredible results. There was a one year ROI on Coca-Cola products displayed by the system, and a spillover effect from so-called "category-lift," in the form of a total one-month ROI for all nearby soda products — i.e., this system sells a lot of soda for Coca-Cola and all other brands near it. There's no word yet on when or how Coca-Cola might roll this out to other stores, but given how positive the results were for the pilot tests, it is likely you'll see one someday at the end of the soda aisle in your local grocery. On a more technical note, I'm not sure exactly what sort of data is being sent to the displays by nearby phones or how it is taken. Allegedly the system uses Google's Eddystone beacons, which exchange information with nearby phones using Bluetooth low energy. This is the first time I've heard of Google's Beacon Platform actually being used, combined with DoubleClick's targeting advertising systems, to target people in the physical world. The privacy-conscious might express some concern at the potential of having your phone communicate your preferences to an in-store display, but I would hope and assume that any identifying information is stripped out. Either way, we're one step closer to this. Source: Digital Strategy Consulting Tags beacon platform beacons bluetooth low energy Coca-Cola Eddystone Targeted advertisements video subscribe ...

Anu6is Stop being absurd, how else would you know what you NEED? WesleySmalls Actually, you do. People require social interaction, it's a very strong part of our being. Humans generally don't like to be alone, and very much can't over longer periods of time. Because of this, people tend to follow each other's example in one way or another, advertising is just one of the many examples Ben Yeah, your phone communicating with a vending machine to give you personalised advertisements is not in any way 'social interaction'. WesleySmalls I did not say anything about that, it wasn't even remotely close, nor was the post I commented on. But of course, else you had to actually comment on my actual post, and realize that it's true that people follow other people Prezes Dyrektor But you are making it sound like advertising is indispensable in our lives. Well guess what, ads is the reason why I cut cable tv, they don't have those fancy adblockers. Ads is the reason I mostly listen to local academic radio without any. Etc. Ads and marketing are evil, and we are being manipulated every day. Now excuse me as I run to grab some sugar soda and candy. xyz Your second sentence was "People require social interaction". It seems you didn't bother reading your own comment. WesleySmalls Indeed, that was a art of my comment, which was a reply to a comment that wasnt about any digital technologies. Ryne Hager https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKlSVNxLB-A xyz "Humans generally don't like to be alone, and very much can't over longer periods of time." Right, that's why we have these things called friends and family. I mean if ads are your way making the loneliness go away, good for you. WesleySmalls It wasnt really difficult to grasp that advertisement uses these relationships and human behavior to advertise their product Avishek GSkynet: Resistance is Futile https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/eceea630e7e43621ded725c3914bdc7a06d9b153943c3512fb6b0f0eeff75d71.png Bryan Does it just give a different Coke commercial based on my tastes? Or are people going to start getting ads for the sex toys they have in their amazon cart? Bane✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ There's one way to find out. Add some (more) sex toys to your Amazon cart and then go grocery shopping! Deannalshepherd Google is paying 97$ per hour!

Ryne Hager I actually haven't seen one in my area yet, when I go out west in a month I'll see if I can drop by an Albertson's. Carlos Rodríguez So, you have sex toys in your cart, right? Ryne Hager Obviously not enough sex toys, if you're questioning that. Carlos Rodríguez “( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)” yochanan Albertson's are now all Safeway's, FYI. Ryne Hager Albertson's acquired Safeway back in 2015, indeed. yochanan Right, but it wasn't until fairly recently (at least in Northern CO) that Albertsons stores have been converted into Safeway's. Francesco Lorenzet i suppose they will have a whitelist Bane✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Well, I'm a blank slate to advertising. I might as well be a ghost. I block all ads, turn off all targeted options everywhere, and never click on any. I guess I'll have to turn off Bluetooth when I'm in stores now too. Fadakar lol if you think your record is clean you need to re-evaluate how seriously you want to take privacy. James F This. People underestimate how much of a digital footprint they leave, even if they do turn off everything. EowynCarter True. And if they are, they wouldn't show me ads for coca cola, I just don't like that. And sodas in general. Cakefish Agreed, if I have to endure advertising it might as well be about products that actually interest me. Bewear I am a fan of your picture edits, Ryne. Ryne Hager What a coincidence, I am also a fan of your work. I kept a Bewear in my party for most of Moon. Anu6is lol! Lord Argyris My party was boring. Two of them were from Gen I, and apart from my starter, only one other member was from Gen VII. Now really, Nintendo should get in on this whole Coke-Google partnership thing. Maybe put something in their 3DS games that ties into this advertising platform. "Oh, so you're raising a bunch of Fire-type Pokemon. I'll bet you're feeling pretty hot right about now. Know what would cool you right down? A nice, ice cold COKE." Ryne Hager I mean, with the launch event Munchlax and Munchlax/Snorlax available on the first island, who in their right mind didn't take a Gen I Snorlax to end game. Michael Oghia I came here just to give you a +1 for Hypno Toad. Steve Actually noticed this happening to me recently when near the vending machine at my job. Guessing the capabilities will be endless and more diverse when full-on set-ups are placed everywhere. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/7ea9fde9939850ddee856f08d34c3e8a98a6c90461c779f049060ec4e655b8c6.png https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/f87dc3afe5a1492c33e179552b9fcf3259d388ef4a1a6cfed7951d9612faeae6.png https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/da689e538e0681368f0ef1dac408a796aa111781564a9ded426c4639fbeab351.jpg F4LL0U7 Disabling Nearby will disable invasive ads, you say? Done! Morten Ulv Google usually have a way to opt out. james fuston https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPGgTy5YJ-g Ben Nothing better than a new way to sell people tooth-rotting, diabetes-causing sugar water. Nicholas Conrad *This* is the gateway to AR! Aing actual R; genius! abqnm Are these connected to the "Nearby" activity in Google Settings? (Which also interestingly enough at some point has earned the ability to add the Nearby activity directly to the homescreen. Don't know when it appeared as I don't open that screen often, but it's now an option in the overflow menu.) James F Beacons typically use Bluetooth. abqnm Yes, and Google's Nearby uses Bluetooth LE scanning and Play Services location. But with Google being a part of it, I'm asking if it is directly related to the Nearby function. I am not asking for how beacons typically work. MJ Double checked BT is off on my phone... The only time ever use it is when play music on a BT speaker which I don't do when grocery shopping. "With that info, displays are able to select content based on your preferences in the form of advertisements specifically targeted to passersby" How does these ads work exactly? I am not watching a 54min video. Dedren You don't need bluetooth on per say. It just uses that tech. I believe you will have to enable Nearby places, which is disabled by default but will probably be enabled by default in the future. MJ Nearby places will not be going on... F4LL0U7 I'm not sure they could develop an ad that's targeted enough to get me to buy Coke. F4LL0U7 I guess I might consider it if the vending machine held a family member hostage or something. James F I don't know if I should be concerned that you said *might* consider it.... F4LL0U7 What can I say, I'm just not very receptive to ads. Dedren What about Water, Sprite, SimplyOrange, Powerade, Minute Maid? Surely one of those you drink...all Coke. F4LL0U7 I mean, of course I drink water, but I get it from the filtered pitcher in my fridge. No to the others. xyz You regularly purchase water from the Coca-Cola company? May I also say, I've never heard of SimplyOrange and Powerade. I had no idea that diabetes and obesity came in so many flavors. Adrian quickest way to turn me off on a product. Bluetooth is only on in my car anyway so good luck with it. As soon as someone figures out how to spoof it and annoy people in public, it will go away. Max Johnson I thought it's been NFC and GPS all this time. At least from my Android Pay app. Adrian I don't leave either on when I'm not using them so it's probably a non-issue for me then. blindexecutioner I would literally break my phone if I got an ad as I walked by a pop machine (or whatever) if I couldn't opt out of it of course.. I would switch to iOS that day. If it happened on iOS I would stop using smart phones altogether. tehboogieman You could just turn off bluetooth. Or you know, there's your way rndusrnm479461 iOS also supports this same thing. rndusrnm479461 I've read the whole article and even watched some of that video and I still don't get it - what do your "preferences" affect in the ads? How will it affect what the ad displays? Does it just play the ad you're more likely to prefer from 5 different ads? I'm confused... Why is such system necessary for something simple like coke? Would make more sense for a bus stop ad or other kinds of billboards. Joey1058 I hate to tell you folks this, but I've been out in the wilderness preaching this for at least a good 10 years, if you go by my 2007 blog post: http://joey1058.blogspot.com/2007/07/robots-dreams-is-vending-machine-robot.html Cakefish ALL GLORY TO THE HYPNOTOAD!!! xyz Damn, you got me. I have no choice now but to buy a Pepsi. psuedonymous "On a more technical note, I'm not sure exactly what sort of data is being sent to the displays by nearby phones or how it is taken." BLE Beacons are transmit-only. In order for a piece of ad signage to get any information from you, the chain works like this: BLE beacon emits location. Phone detects beacon, is informed that it is near location. Software on phone then queries backend platform (Google's Beacon platform in this case) to see if there is anything it needs to do with this new knowledge. This could be displaying a popup message, or in this case the phone itself does nothing. Instead, since Google's service has learnt your phone is near a beacon (geographically it cares not, this is logical nearness rather than necessarily physical nearness) so contacts the beacon owner with "Anonuser is nearby who hits your preset filter for Target users" (e.g. users who like coke, users who are above a certain age, users who have not previously pinged this beacon, etc). 'Anonuser' could be a unique but nonpersonal hash, a semi-persistant hash (e.g. for each ad client only), a time-limited persistant hash (e.g. valid for only a certain period before changing, probably just for the single proximity session), or just no hash at all so the ad client cannot track individual users. There may be an avenue for the ad client to pass a message back to google who can then pass it onto the user, without the ad client knowing who the user is.

Name: Subject: Message: Results are in: The best Android smartphone camera is… Featuresby Nirave Gondhiaby Edgar Cervantes17 hours ago 52 1453 32 Which Android smartphone has the best camera and sets the benchmark that other manufacturers need to aim for? We set out to answer this question with an impromptu camera shootout in San Francisco a couple of weeks ago, and in traditional fashion, YOU chose which smartphone had the best camera! Our search for the answer to this question saw us put Samsung’s latest, the Galaxy S8, up against the best from its rivals, including the LG G6, Sony Xperia XZs, Huawei P10, Google Pixel XL and OnePlus 3T! Now the votes are in and have been counted, let’s reveal the winner! In each of the galleries below, the images are in this order: Top row (l-r): Google Pixel XL, Huawei P10, LG G6 Bottom row (l-r): OnePlus 3T, Samsung Galaxy S8 and Sony Xperia XZs. Now over to our resident photo guy Edgar for his take on which smartphone took the best photos. Photos like this one are tricky for most smartphone cameras. There is a harsh light in the back, often causing high contrast or a silhouette effect. It’s not easy for a camera to decipher what it should do. The easiest step would be to jump into HDR mode. Regardless, these photos were taken with stock settings and it is up to each phone to decide what it should do. Which one does it better? Votes say the Google Pixel XL is the clear winner, but in this specific shot we do feel the shadows and contrast are too harsh. The Huawei P10, OnePlus 3T and Sony Xperia XZs managed to catch more details in dark areas and the skin, but they also had to compensate with a hazy effect we often see with overly lit backgrounds. Overall, the Pixel XL did make for a more striking image, but if you want to see more details you should go with the phones mentioned above. LG G6 Galaxy S8 We actually feel like the LG G6 may have done a better job here, mostly because it closely emulates how things looked to the naked eye. This shot has a good contrast, is nice on the details, the shadowed part of David is bright enough and the whole frame looks more evenly exposed. You may notice how the Google Pixel XL and Sony Xperia XZs show less of the details in the background trees. The OnePlus 3T used many effects to fix this, but it also made the photo a bit washed out while doing so. Things are looking better when the light source is hitting the subject directly, but you can see very clear differences here. Which phone better captured our inspiring poses? We would understand why you picked the Google Pixel XL. The warm tones and saturated colors really add to the ambiance and almost make the image look like a painting. Google definitely makes a more dramatic shot. In terms of white balance, we feel Sony did do a better job. And if what you want is details in the shadows I would go for the Huawei P10 (just take a look at Edgar’s beard). Photographing food is a little tricky. It is often done in low light, has both bright and tamed colors, and the white balance can be hard to measure. We like that the Google Pixel XL and Sony Xperia XZs show more details in the rice and sauce, but the LG G6 was better at catching the right white balance and color. Overall, though, the differences are not too far off. LG G6 Galaxy S8 We gotta give it to the Samsung Galaxy S8 here. The image is crisper than most competitors. The contrast is also much better, as is detail in the shadows. It was a great food shot from Sammy! We also like the Galaxy S8’s performance with this shot. White balance is good, colors are well saturated and everything looks crisp. Especially in this one you can see other cameras just seem to display a mush of colors, while the Galaxy S8 differentiates more between ingredients. There is a slight purple tint, something the Google Pixel XL was much better at handling. We would agree with those who voted for the Google Pixel XL or the Samsung Galaxy S8. These seem to display a much more true-to-life shot. Other photos were too dark or washed out. It’s hard to catch good shadows under trees while keeping details visible, but we feel these two handsets did a great job without making the photo look over-processed. It is all about that balance. We happen to like the Samsung Galaxy S8’s image due to the fact that you get enough details in the trees, while also catching pretty colors of the sky and green lawn. It is well saturated, but not over the top. And colors are still quite accurate. The Samsung Galaxy S8 offers a prettier sight here, with vibrant greens, great shadows and a crisp look at this pond in the Golden Gate park. The Google Pixel XL also did a great job, but the image looks a bit less striking because it looks more true-to-life. Those who prefer something more natural looking will probably go for the Pixel’s image. This one is a little trickier than we thought, which would explain why votes are not as polarized in this section. We have to say our favorite is the Samsung Galaxy S8, as it managed to at least get the exposure right and catch the details well. Look at the turtle’s texture, you can see that grainy surface. The P10 also did pretty good in that department, but outputs more striking shadows. LG G6 Galaxy S8 The Google Pixel XL takes this one by far. Colors are most natural, detail is crisp and the shadows stay relatively visible. In a high-contrast image the real test is to try to catch the details in the dark, which was easy with this photo, given that there is plenty of blocks to look at in this building. The Google Pixel XL, LG G6 and Samsung Galaxy S8 are about the best in the bunch. Then discard the Google Pixel XL for that hazy effect and the LG G6 for the purple tint. The winner is the Samsung Galaxy S8, in our opinion. It’s a little hard to rate selfie shots, just because which one is best is a very subjective topic. The Google Pixel XL has great colors, but the shadows are a bit harsh. Then you have the LG G6, which does a great overall job, but it gives off that luminance effect that makes skin looks too smooth (like porcelain). The Galaxy S8 does a good general job at exposure, color balance and post-processing. Ultimately, it is a matter of preference. LG G6 Galaxy S8 This one is not exactly a selfie, but it is a close-up of a face, taken with the rear camera. Regardless, it is a tricky shot due to the contrasting light between the subject and the background, making it a good test photo. The Google Pixel XL and Samsung Galaxy S8 are the closest competitors here. These did a better job balancing the light in the shadows and highlights. The Google Pixel XL does show an overblown sky, but the colors and shadows in Lanh’s face look very natural. Meanwhile, the Galaxy S8 catches brighter colors and a more uniform exposure, with less contrasting shades. That wide angle on the LG G6! You simply can’t beat it. And it also helps that the camera is pretty good at capturing selfies. The Samsung Galaxy S8 does show a better image, but there is one issue most images had: the lit part in both Nirave’s and David’s faces. The Google Pixel XL and Sony Xperia XZs were the best at handling that harsh light difference, but they did it in different ways. The Google Pixel XL simply darkened the whole image, while the Sony sensor was better at brightening the shadows and lowering the highlights. So that’s our opinion, but which smartphone did YOU think won the shootout? Tallying up the votes, here’s how each phone ranked and the votes cast in each poll: Phone Poll 1 Poll 2 Poll 3 Poll 4 Poll 5 Total votes % of votes Google Pixel XL 1509 501 790 521 859 4180 41.90% Huawei P10 172 115 55 226 112 680 6.82% LG G6 682 262 81 205 280 1510 15.14% OnePlus 3T 147 192 71 226 77 713 7.15% Samsung Galaxy S8 535 526 441 208 346 2059 20.61% Sony Xperia XZs 288 155 114 95 184 836 8.38% With a whopping 41% of the overall votes, the Pixel XL is a clear winner followed by the Galaxy S8 in second place with 20.61% and the LG G6 in third with 15.14%. Sony’s Xperia XZs comes in fourth place with 8.38% of the votes, while the OnePlus 3T (7.15%) and the Huawei P10 round off the scoring (6.82%). It’s surprising that so many people voted for the Pixel XL as we feel it was a lot closer between that, the Galaxy S8 and the LG G6.    Of course, we also read the comments on every shootout in a bid to make each one better than the last and with this shootout, we tried a couple of new things (such as multi-page and group voting) based on the feedback provided in the last blind camera shootout we conducted. While it’s not possible to please everyone, we do want to make each camera shootout the very best it can be so we’re asking YOU, the readers, to give us your thoughts on how we can improve. Please help us by filling in the survey above – it won’t take more than a couple of minutes of your time and we’ll be using the responses to help shape our camera tests and camera shootouts going forward!

In separate blog posts, both Google and Owlchemy Labs announced the deal without disclosing purchase price or other specifics of the acquisition. Owlchemy Labs said, "We set out on a journey over six years ago to build the kinds of games we wanted to see exist. Over those years, we learned that Owlchemy, at its core, cares deeply about a few key things: building quality multi-platform games, solving tough problems with a small but absurdly talented team, sharing our learnings with the community, and Austin's famous tacos. Now, as we look to the future with Google by our side, we couldn't be happier. Our plan to build awesome things will continue forward stronger than ever. "This means Owlchemy will continue building high quality VR content for platforms like the HTC Vive, Oculus Touch, and PlayStation VR. This means continuing to focus on hand interactions and high quality user experiences, like with Job Simulator. This means continuing our mission to build VR for everyone, and doing all of this as the same silly Owlchemy Labs you know and love. We are continuing to do all of this with even more support and focus on building awesome stuff. It's incredibly exciting that Google and Owlchemy are so well aligned on our goals and vision for the future of VR... "We're insanely excited to join the Google family and we cannot freaking wait to show you what we're concocting next at Owlchemy Labs. The future of VR is extremely bright, so we're donning our lab goggles just in case." For its part, Google commented, "Today, we're thrilled to welcome Owlchemy Labs to Google. They've created award-winning games like Job Simulator and Rick and Morty: Virtual Rick-ality which have really thoughtful interactive experiences that are responsive, intuitive, and feel natural. They've helped set a high bar for what engagement can be like in virtual worlds, and do it all with a great sense of humor! "Together, we'll be working to create engaging, immersive games and developing new interaction models across many different platforms to continue bringing the best VR experiences to life. There is so much more to build and learn, so stay tuned!" Google's big push in VR thus far is with the Daydream mobile platform. There's no doubt the company can benefit from the expertise of folks like Owlchemy Labs. Let's hope that Owlchemy's creative freedom isn't dampened at all by being absorbed by a behemoth like Google.

Home FEATURED Cellphones Notebooks Gaming Tablets Software Google Makes Offline Page Management Simplified in Chrome for Android May 11, 2017, By Sanjeev Ramachandran Share This Related Posts Comcast Spruces up Home Wireless Network Management with Xfinity xFi OnePlus Confirms Name and Release Date of Its Next Flagship Chrome’s ability to download pages and let them be accessed offline is something that has become a bog-standard at present. For that reason, Google is now expanding its offline features in Chrome to take it a notch above the rest. As a result, Google is now updating its Android version of Chrome to encompass new features that will ease the task of offline page management for its users. Version 58 of Chrome for Android features several upgrade, and the most prominent one among them is its ability to quickly let users download the entire webpage. Just a long-click will now do the job for users, as with the update, the long-click options for a link will also pop up a new ‘Download link’ option through which users can get the entire web-page paired with the link downloaded. The feature is not just applicable to links, and it can also be worked upon article suggestion on a new tab page. Google is also adding a Download Page Later option to pages that will appear offline due to network connectivity or any other issues. The option will be popped up along the dinosaur image for those pages, and Chrome will automatically pull out the downloaded page once when online. Also, Chrome now makes it easier to view offline pages by putting up a new offline badge in your recent download list. You can view them also when opening new tabs along with the suggested webpage list. Google introduced offline capabilities to Chrome back in December last year. Despite arriving late, the feature seems to have found a liking among users. Google claims that over 45 million web pages have been downloaded on weekly basis. The latest version of Chrome for Android is already up on Google Play.

Tesla opens preorders for its solar roofs Tesla has opened preorders for its solar roof tiles, designed to be an inconspicuous and durable alternative to traditional solar panels (WIRED). UK customers will have to pay an £800 deposit, which Tesla says will be "fully refundable until you enter into a purchase and installation agreement". The tempered glass tiles, currently only available in textured and smooth varieties, with tuscan and slate styles to follow in 2018, will initially ship to US customers, starting this year, with buyers elsewhere in the world to get theirs in 2018, according to a tweet by Tesla CEO Elon Musk.

The UK is second in European Nanny State index The UK is the second most restrictive country in the EU when it comes to government-imposed controls on its citizens' eating, drinking, vaping and smoking habits (The Register). Figures from the Europe-wide Nanny State Index, published by the European Policy Information Center (EPICENTER) economic think tank, reveals that only Finland imposes more restrictions, bans and taxes on the lifestyle and recreational choices of its citizens in these areas. The study notes: "The UK has some particularly punitive sin taxes. It has the highest taxes on cigarettes and wine in the EU and the second highest taxes on beer. Britain's Nanny State Index score for food and soft drinks arguably makes the country seem more liberal than it is because it does not include the food reformulation scheme which has led to chocolate bars shrinking and food products becoming less tasty as Public Health England pushes food manufacturers towards reducing sugar, salt and fat content." 3. New version of Opera integrates messaging apps Opera's newest browser, named Opera Reborn has built-in support for a number of popular online chat services, allowing you to pin chat conversations to the side of your browser so you don't have to keep tab switching to get back to the person you're talking to (Ars Technia). Supported messaging services include WhatsApp, Telegram and Facebook Messenger. Opera Reborn is version 45 of the browser, built on the Chromium 58 rendering engine and with features including a new interface, Opera's free VPN/proxy service and an integrated ad blocker, although the latter automatically whitelists Facebook, Google, Yandex and Baidu by default. 4. Maths genius' 'scribblings' put online for the world to decypher Montpellier University in France has uploaded almost 18,000 pages of notes made by mathematician Alexandre Grothendieck, who died in 2014 (Yahoo News). Grothendieck revolutionised the fields of algebraic geometry and pure mathematics, and is regarded by many to be the greatest mathematician of the 20th century. He described the notes, for which his children granted online publication rights to the university, as his "scribblings". Jean-Michel Marin of the Institut Montpelliérain Alexander Grothendieck said: "It will take years of work by experts to benefit from his notes. There are only a few hundred people in the world who could understand them."

Jupiter's moon Io could have a complex system of volcanic plumbing The most detailed map yet of volcanic activity on Jupiter’s moon Io has been created, showing complex waves of lava covering its largest volcanic lake (WIRED). Io, the closest of Jupiter’s four Galilean moons, is the most geologically active body in our Solar System, and contains the least amount of water. To see these volcanoes in more detail, researchers observed Io during a rare event – when Europa passed in front of it and gradually blocked it from view. This meant researchers were able to isolate the light from certain parts of the moon. The infrared data captured by the researchers showed the surface temperature of Io's massive molten lake steadily increased from one end to the other. This means the lava had overturned in two waves that each swept from west to east at about one kilometre (3,300ft) per day.

Widespread Android security flaw won't be fixed until O Security researchers at Check Point have found a security vulnerability that affects around 40 per cent of Android devices currently in use (TechRadar). The vulnerability affects all phones running Android 6.0.1 (Marshmallow) and above, and involves a run-time permission that allows app to have elements sitting on top of other panes, such as the chat bubbles used by Facebook Messenger. Apps previously had to be granted specific permission by the user to do this, but to avoid user confusion, Android's recent versions automatically grant this permission to any app installed from the Google Play Store. Although this offers a certain degree of security thanks to Google's automated malware scanning software for the store, malicious apps have sneaked in before. Google says that it's aware of the problem, but that it doesn't anticipate having a fix in place until the release of Android O later this summer.

Long read: How Vladimir Putin mastered the art of 'online Judo' – and why the west should be worried In April 2014, Vladimir Putin told an audience in St Petersburg that the internet was a "CIA project" (WIRED). His claim reflected a deeply-held belief among Russia's elite that the internet was a threat to their grip on power – a tool of subversion created to spread western values. But today, it is not Russia that is on the defensive but the west which is reeling on the mat, its own digital strength turned against it. Russia has learnt to effectively marshal technology – in domestic control, in espionage, in sabotage and in a new type of warfare. The internet may not really be a CIA project, but some of its champions in Silicon Valley did believe that it would change the world. And Russia's mastery raises a difficult question for them: what if everything you have been told about how the internet was going to be a harbinger of liberation is wrong? 8. Marvel Television is making a Deadpool cartoon Fox-owned US TV station FXX has commissioned a 10-episode Deadpool cartoon series for adults from Marvel Television (VentureBeat). The series will be run by Donald and Stephen Glover (Atlanta), and the order is in line with FXX's stated intention to compete "aggressively" when it comes to animated television. The merc with the mouth's TV debut is scheduled for 2018, although no cast details are currently available. 9. A 'big-budget' Judge Dredd series is in development 2000 AD publisher Rebellion has announced that it's partnering with entertainment studio IM Global to develop a new TV series called Mega-City One, based on the Judge Dredd comics (BBC News). The series is currently in the hands of executive producers Stuart Ford (DREDD) and Mark Stern (Battlestar Galactica) of IM Global alongside Rebellion owners Jason and Chris Kingsley, who also executive produced Judge Dredd's fan-favourite 2012 movie outing. Jason and Chris Kingsley said: "We’re very excited to be beginning the journey to get more of Judge Dredd’s Mega-City One on the television screen. Thanks to the legions of fans who have kept up pressure on social media, and a lot of background work and enthusiasm, we aim to make a big budget production that will satisfy both our vast comics audience and the even greater general screen-watching public.” 10.

In June, thousands of hopeful candidates will put their faith in millions of voters, who, in turn, rely on the goodwill and accuracy of volunteer vote counters. After many years of practice, the systems in place are finely tuned but getting to this final stage requires some improvement. It's not uncommon for people to be unsure where a polling station, for example, or know who is standing in their area. Plus there's a lack of an official candidate database.

Some Pixel and Nexus fingerprint sensors not working after Android 7.1.2 update Scott Scrivens View All Posts 2017/04/14 12:17pm PDTApr 14, 2017 70 Plus 1 on G+ 115 Share on Facebook 79 Share on Twitter Total Shares264 Bug Watch Device Updates News Nexus 5X Nexus 6P Pixel Pixel XL A number of Google Pixel and Nexus users are reporting that their fingerprint sensor is no longer working after the latest Android OS update. Several members of the Pixel and Nexus communities on Google's product forums have encountered the issue since installing the Android Nougat 7.1.2 OTA. The issue appears to be affecting both the Pixel and Pixel XL, as well as the LG-made Nexus 5X and Huawei Nexus 6P. Reports suggest that while the Pixel and Nexus Imprint sensors are no longer granting access to the devices, the swipe down for notifications Moves gesture is still functional. Attempts to solve the problem by deleting pre-existing fingerprints and starting from scratch haven't worked, as error messages are preventing new prints from being added to the devices. As usual, we'll update if we hear any official word from Google about the issue, hopefully regarding a fix.

Sean Please GO AWAY....you have said this TWICE.......Its NOT the Nexus 5 and 6 Mr Brainiac....its the 5X and 6P......which are TOTALLY different than the Nexus 5 and Nexus 6. Max Same here with my XL. elav Me too. No issues on my XL.. Nicholas Matranga My Nexus 5x works just fine after the update. kalehv Sometimes my Pixel XL asks for pattern even after it recognizes my fingerprint (no, I am not talking about the first time after reboot). Rebooting the device works but why does this happen? Nathan Bryant I've also experienced this. It's random. Not so often it's a bother for me. kalehv Yup not so often with me either but being a mobile developer what bothers me is this happening, not the inconvenience it causes. Nathan Bryant That totally makes sense. I assume it's some kind of error even though it's not stating that it is. I don't see the pattern or constant of what causes it when it happens. mattcoz It does that after more than 48 hours have passed since you've last used your pattern. kalehv Nop its not that either. It does that after 4 hours I think. And it should do that only once after 4 hours but not keep doing that until you reboot. mattcoz It's definitely 48 hours, that comes straight from Google. But if it continues to do so, then that's something else. Mgamerz I've had it happen on my Nexus, it just occasionally requires a PIN. Says it's 4 hours of non usage but that doesn't seem true, sometimes I wake up and no pin and sometimes I'll be on and off the phone and it'll require a pin. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Typical. Google needs to fire some of their geniuses and hire some diligent coders, and also diligent testers for their QA department (assuming they even have one -- I sincerely doubt it). Alex Cruz Where did Google touch you? Middlefinger Oh really. Nexus/Pixel/Google error 4.453.563 this year alone. Im shocked (not really). Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Best hot steaming pile of dog s**t 2016. DragoCubed Google has been going downhill lately - at least with mobile excluding iOS. It's such a shame. They haven't exactly gone downhill haven't they? They've stayed the same SpeakethTheTruth I think you might be on to something with that last paragraph. Cause for real, quality control is out of control right now. sebastianer If fixed my 6P bad battery life and early shutdown only replacing the stock Huawei battery with other battery with different brand (no need to wipe the phone in the process...) Several people did the same and is enjoying the battery life they were having when they bought the phone more than a year ago: https://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=3534410 You could even try a Huawei battery replacement...but they say they aren't original. I just went for another brand because of the bad experience I had with the stock battery durability I don't know in the Pixel. But in the 6P in 90% of the cases...this is just a problem of the Huawei stock battery. Kendall Gustafson “Pixel”, the word sounds like the color pink. “Pixel” sounds like a little girl’s toy. Most men would never put a phone in their pocket named “Pixel” unless they were a cross/dresser. The word “Pixel” equates to a 50% loss of market share from the male market. “Nexus”, the word does not sound female or male. “Nexus”, the word sounds like science, desirable to any man, woman, or child. “Nexus”, the word sound like domination of market share. kalehv Hahaha that made me laugh. No I do not agree. I am a Pixel owner man and I am not whatever you said they'd be if they owned one but I laughed for some reason. Christian Trevor Clauss I must be a cross dresser then :D mattcoz Real men aren't insecure about what their phones are named.

No need to test or anything. Too much trouble for the geniuses at Google. They're so smart that if it compiles with just warnings, there couldn't possibly be any problems. John Doe I am sure that they do test it but there are things that go wrong...obviously those bugs will be in the spotlight on an Android blog meaning in real life they are probably affecting a small number of users. This is why you do a roll out of the OTA not just dump it all out there. Bruce Wayne Ohhh...Lol. I just re-read his statement now. thereasoner There's a petition for you guys to sign online but so far only 156 have done so and probably half of those are just haters without a Nexus or Pixel. Seems to me that the issues are isolated. Bruce Wayne Yeah, that must be it. You're not experiencing it so half of us are just haters and the issues are isolated. Yup, that's it. Thanks for the ingenious insight. thereasoner Even if all 156 are genuine it would still be quite a small number of users no? Bruce Wayne Except that's not the number of people experiencing problems. thereasoner Still, when there are well over 900 people in India signing a petition just for the 6p to have voLTE activated and the whole world combined can only manage 156 for this issue then it kind of says something imo. neates Pixel and Nexus - rich beta testers...

New_Guy Yep Mark Curtis What do you mean "this is how you get more Samsung"? 4Ui812 Why is Google having app many issues with the Fixel ? Sruly J Except since it's also affecting Nexus devices, this is more of a software issue in 7.1.2 than a hardware issue for Pixel devices. Defenestratus Because IIRC they use Agile software development. Agile is how you get shitty software. Lawstorant I've never thought I would say such thing, but I'm getting fed up with all the "issues" Google is facing with every update. On the Nexus 6, they went as far as to roll it back to 7.0. They should really step up their game especially if, they are fully responsible for every aspect of the device from now on. EvilHowl No issues on my 5X wade_county I thought these Pixels weren't supposed to be beta products? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ They aren't. They're outrageously expensive alpha products. And they even have one defect (halo-cam) that can't be fixed in software. Still the best steaming pile of dog s**t of 2016, though. Everyone should buy one. Everyone who likes dog s**t anyway. Apparently people do, since HTC has shipped 2 million since launch. Kougeru I bad a Pixel for a week and took dozens of photos with no halo Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Good for you. Phandroid did an LG G6 vs. Pixel photo comparison. 4 out of 22 Pixel pictures had halos. None of the 22 G6 pictures had halos. They were all pictures of the same things, obviously with the same lighting. Google admits it's a design defect. If Google admits it, it's kind of hard to pretend it doesn't exist. whispy_snippet No one denies it's an issue. But what you seem incapable of accepting is it's a very minor issue that only very rarely rears its head. If you actively try to shoot an image with a strong light source angled towards the sensor (something you generally don't do because it often results in a poor shot on any camera) you might experience a halo effect. Might. But I've got literally hundreds of photos taken with my Pixel with no halos. You can choose to believe whatever exaggerated narrative you want to fuel your juvenile rage fits. But people who actually use a Pixel every day don't seem to have a problem worth caring about. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ It has nothing to do with a strong light source angled toward the sensor. That's normal lens flare. The Pixel halos are NOT normal lens flare. Like I said 4 out of 22 pictures. That's 18% of the pictures they took, and they didn't have strong light sources angled toward the sensor. 18% is not a rare problem, especially when the G6 NEVER had halos with the same exact pictures. Google admitted it's a flaw. Get over yourself and stop trying to justify it. whispy_snippet And like I said, I've taken hundreds of pictures and have seen a halo perhaps a couple of times. And I take a lot of photos given video and photography is my day job - indeed one of the reasons I chose the Pixel is because I wanted the best phone camera available for the times I don't have my proper gear with me. I've seen countless comparisons between the Pixel, iPhone 7 and Galaxy S7 edge and while they're all great, in most situations the Pixel takes what I consider the better shot. You're making mountains out of molehills and carrying on like a right twat in the process. P. Sherman ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE DOESN'T MEAN JACKS--- if in scientific tests under controlled environments and the same conditions, the Pixel produced the halo effect, which Google has acknowledged to be a design deficiency standard on LITERALLY EVERY PIXEL MADE, but other cameras feature no such halo effect. FFS whispy_snippet I'm not denying there's an issue! I'm saying it's being blown out of proportion by people who want to blow it out of proportion. P. Sherman Referencing a scientific, controlled test and camera comparison is NOT blowing this out of proportion. Blowing out of proportion would be something how the Wall Street Journal set out to destroy PewDiePie for boneheadedly saying "Death to all Jews" as a joke. But referencing a camera comparison in exactly the same conditions and one phone had a halo effect but the other didn't is science, fact, nothing to blow out of proportion there. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Good luck arguing with a Google fanboy in deep denial. thereasoner He's actually making solid points, the Pixels do have the best cameras overall​ and all smartphone cameras have some issues. whispy_snippet No, no. I'm a fanboy! Get it right! Cecil Hardwood Are you sure the Pixel has the best camera ? The reason I ask is because the DxOMark site that claims this refuses to release the iPhone 7 Plus (Not iPhone 7) scores and many believe it is because it scored higher than the Pixel. The theory goes on to say that Google is using their score in their advertising and DxO doesn't want to piss off Google. Something weird is going on for sure. DxO claimed long ago the review was coming soon and should have been out by now with the iPhone 7 Plus having been on the market as long as it has. thereasoner If I'm to make a judgment personally then I would say that probably the top 3-4 cameras on flagships are very close and what's best as far as the user is concerned is subjective. Do you prefer low light performance(I do) or digital zoom? Do your favour widespread angle lens or fast launch/focus etc. Those are personal preferences that make "the best " phone different for different people. That said, as far as reviews are concerned the Pixel is generally considered the best over all. As far as your conspiracy theories go, who knows? Anyone can create those about anything but I guess but I'm thinking that other than digital zoom and an artsy photo effect the 7+ cameras are very similar to the 7. whispy_snippet The iPhone 7 Plus is the same as the iPhone 7 apart from an additional, slower lens. In terms of raw image quality the iPhone 7 Plus achieves its best results with the lens it shares with its smaller sibling. So basically, it'll score no better than the 7. It's effectively already been tested. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ All smartphone cameras have some issues? What issues does the G6 camera have in the comparison I linked? 23% of the Pixel photos have halo issues. Find a serious issue with 23% of the G6 photos and get back to us. thereasoner Keep in mind that if you take wide-angle shots, angles will be distorted and elongated from the side, especially when it comes to selfies with the front-facing camera. I also found that the front-facing camera takes relatively muddy shots in low-light. Compared to the Pixel XL, OnePlus 3T and (for the time being since we don't have the S8) the Galaxy S7, the G6 is on par with its rivals. The Pixel XL takes superior low-light images than all the phones though, and I prefer the richer contrast and saturation of the S7 by just a tad. -CNET There are a ton of reviews from various sources just like this and while the G6 cameras are considered very nice they do have their shortcomings and generally rank below the Pixel cameras overall. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I wasn't saying the G6 has the best camera. I was saying that 23% of the Pixel pictures have halos and 100% of the G6 pictures do not. The halo problem is not a rare occurrence. I don't buy a phone for its camera. But if I did, and my only two choices were the G6 and the Pixel, I would definitely buy the G6. If my choices included other phones, I wouldn't buy the G6 or the Pixel. thereasoner It must be rare and only under certain circumstances because I've taken well over 200 pics so far on my Pixel and haven't seen it once. Just because one reviewers chosen testing parameters show the halo that doesn't mean that the test reflects real world use/performance from users like me. The so called halo thing wasn't even discovered in initial tests/reviews so does that mean there must be no halo? Going by your standards then I just need to pick a review that rarely shows it then. Unlike you, the camera is one of my top priorities when I choose a smartphone, I use it a lot so it's important to me and I couldn't be happier with the speed and quality of the Pixel cameras myself. It's no wonder that they're​ rated so well and that most reviewers absolutely love it, halo or no halo. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yeah, I believe you. 23% of the pictures on Phandroid, but 0% on your special magic Pixel. Totally believable, especially since you showed us all 200 of your perfect pictures instead of just saying so. Damn those Google liars saying it's a known defect. thereasoner Oh, I'm sure it's there it's just like early reviewers, I too haven't seen it yet but you're only interested in this one review apparently, no other reviews or user experience even matters unless it feeds your hate. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I know, damn those haters at Google saying it's a known defect. thereasoner The haters aren't the ones acknowledging the issue, it's those like you desperately blowing it out of proportion by using one review while simultaneously turning a blind eye to other more positive reviews and users real world experiences. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Users' real-world experiences are nothing but anecdotes. Initial positive reviews occurred before the defect was widely recognized and acknowledged by Google. And Google phones always get positive reviews because they're Google phones. Google could release a crayon drawing of a phone for the Pixel XL 2 and websites would call it the best phone of 2017. Websites can't afford to bite the hand that feeds them and lose both Google advertising and all the downstream advertising. HTC has shipped 2 million Pixel and Pixel XL phones since launch (and that figure doesn't account for all the returned and replaced phones). Obviously not many people see the superiority that you do. And don't bother with the "advertising" excuse. I see the Pixel advertised more than any other phone. thereasoner You really do live in your own little world don't you? Lmao! Have fun making up nonsense, you're only fooling yourself :-) Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Psychological projection is a theory in psychology in which humans defend themselves against their own unconscious impulses or qualities (both positive and negative) by denying their existence in themselves while attributing them to others. whispy_snippet User real world experiences and positive reviews are irrelevant. Only the small amount of negative fringe reviews that deliberately focus on shooting in ways that reveal the halo matter. Right. Got it. whispy_snippet 23% of images taken by Phandroid or 100% of images taken in circumstances that are known to result in the halo effect. It's perfectly feasible to shoot hundreds of images with the Pixel and never see a halo. Look, ultimately no amount of reason is going to convince you because you obviously just hate the fuck out of Google. You simply insist that the Pixel has an enormous issue when it does not. So whatever. Good luck to you mate. whispy_snippet Hahahaha you're so weird!!! Why are you such a hater? What on earth? You're so completely irrational. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Disappeared? You're just not worth the time. But I came here to get a link and noticed your reply. So... Someone tell this guy he's a big fat liar: support dot google dot com/pixelphone/forum/AAAAb4-OgUsrROqMaXHqHg This Google fanboy is a big fat liar, too: highonandroid dot com/android-smartphone-news/the-truth-about-google-pixel-camera-halolens-flare-effect/ Here's that liar's video. He must have hacked the video to support his lies about there being a halo problem. www dot youtube dot com/watch?v=GUjhM2xcKSY whispy_snippet Yes, so as I've agreed many times now, there is a halo effect that sometimes (very rarely) occurs when shooting with the Pixel in specific circumstances. But I see you've conveniently ignored the chromatic aberation and purple flaring I pointed out in the G6 images. No surprises there. whispy_snippet Purple flaring and chromatic aberation. It's extremely noticeable in at least four images you shared with the Pixel comparison. Here you are: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatic_aberration And just Google search purple flaring. Sorry to burst your bubble. whispy_snippet Yep, as I suspected, radio silence once you got hit with a dose of reality. whispy_snippet Show me the link to the test. I would like to see it. Even if their results suggest there's an issue (which there is as we all agree), the significance of the results can still be blown out of proportion which is what we're seeing occur in this ridiculous discussion. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Here you go again. phandroid dot com/2017/03/27/lg-g6-vs-google-pixel-camera/ Now that I've viewed the pics again, actually 4 have obvious halos. One is subtle. Two involve a bright light. The other 3 do not. So that's 23% of 22 pictures. I wouldn't say that's blowing things out of proportion. In addition, some Pixel photos are blurry whereas the G6 photos are not. Yeah, you paid a lot for your Pixel, so you have a hard time admitting it's a steaming pile of dog s**t. I understand. whispy_snippet Yep, so as we've agreed, halos sometimes appear in shots with strong light sources pointing at or angled towards the edge of the sensor. But let's just ignore the purple flaring and chromatic aberation in at least four of the images from the LG, right? You're demonstrating selective criticism. Every camera has strengths and weaknesses but on balance, the Pixel offers better images than competing phones more often than not. My position is unchanged. You're both making mountains out of molehills, and in no way does this "scientific" test guarantee that 23% of photos taken with a Pixel will exhibit a halo. It simply shows 23% of photos taken in this example demonstrated halos. You're both being completely ridiculous. It's like some sort of sorry crusade to demonise a great product by focusing on a tiny negative while ignoring all the positives. No one ever said the Pixel is perfect. But only you two are using ridiculous, extreme labels like "steaming pile of dog shit" and "HARDWARE DEFICIENCY" as though using capital letters makes your odd ball assertions more valid. Most reputable tech reviewers agree the Pixel has the best overall smartphone camera. You're entitled to disagree. Marcelove "You're both being completely ridiculous. It's like some sort of sorry crusade to demonise a great product by focusing on a tiny negative while ignoring all the positives. " HAHA, yeah... Ridiculous is someone like you that ignore all negatives only to not feel bad about the choice of buying a Dead Pixel like you did. But a " photographer " like you said you are that chooses a device without OIS over others with it shows what kind of expert you are at photography. whispy_snippet I've posted this elsewhere but I'll post it again: If you did your homework on the way the Pixel captures images you'd know that it doesn't need OIS for still imagery. It utilises a complex process similar to bracketing - stacking multiple, fast, high-ISO exposures to create an image and then combining these multiple exposures to "erase" noise in the shadows. "Computational photography" is how this process is described and it's a new and innovative approach to overcoming the limitations of small sensors in smartphone cameras. Traditionally, OIS is useful in that it allows a camera operator to use slower shutter speeds. The reason you'd want to use a slower shutter speed? To let more light hit the sensor when in a dim environment and therefore capture brighter, more detailed shots. In most cameras, once you start dropping below a shutter speed of around 1/25th of a second you need OIS to offset hand shake. Even the tiniest amount of hand movement at these sorts of shutter speeds can result in blurry images. However, unlike any other smartphone camera, the Pixel overcomes the need for OIS by using "computational photography" instead. As things get darker, the Pixel can keep shooting at high shutter speeds and still capture sufficient light where other cameras can't. Video is a little different and I could crap on about why this is the case. But in short, I think the Pixel could probably benefit from OIS in this area. However, I think its EIS does a pretty good job and will only keep improving (because unlike OIS, EIS can be improved with software tweaks). The future of smartphone photography almost certainly lies in software which is why the Pixel's​ camera is so exciting. If you want to get smarmy I'm happy to school you, mate. Marcelove STOP dude... WTF? Obviously you won't accept the fact that a Dead Pixel has flaws only because you paid a great sum for it... Usually people won't accept the reality of a bad choice, trying to turn a blind eye to not feel bad about their wrong decision and you are one of them. whispy_snippet Ugh. I'm wasting my time. thereasoner Haters going to hate. thereasoner Well over 200 pictures on my Pixel so far and not one single halo yet. I may come across one someday but overall the cameras have been absolutely fantastic! It's no wonder to me that these cameras are so highly rated, I've seen how good they are first hand. Why would a Pixel owner ignore there own results over a reviewers test that doesn't translate into said users real world performance? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yeah, I believe you. thereasoner You don't have to believe me, believe all the initial reviews that failed to pick up on this obviously minor issue instead. P. Sherman 4/22. 4/22 photos from the Pixel have a halo effect. That's from Phandroid. That's 18% of photos the Pixel. That alone is damning. Google themselves have acknowledged that it is a HARDWARE DEFICIENCY and software fixes have done little to address this. They admitted it was there, that's all we need. If you knew that 4/22 Burritos Chipotle made would give you the Runs, but ZERO/22 Burritos Taco Bell made would, would YOU still choose to eat at Chipotle? whispy_snippet Show me the test! I've asked twice now. P. Sherman Lena Flare was removed from the photos, but not the video. http://highonandroid.com/android-smartphone-news/the-truth-about-google-pixel-camera-halolens-flare-effect/ Also, someone in the official Google forums shot with their Pixel and Nexus 6P in the same Time, conditions, everything. Guess what? https://support.google.com/pixelphone/forum/AAAAb4-OgUsrROqMaXHqHg/?hl=by Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ phandroid dot com/2017/03/27/lg-g6-vs-google-pixel-camera/ 3 halos are obvious, 1 is subtle. The subtle one is where the picture is looking up at a building's windows. Now that I've viewed them again, actually 4 have obvious halos. One is subtle. In addition, some Pixel photos are blurry whereas the G6 photos are not. tigerstown I paid $380 for my new pixel XL so it's not a lot and I have no Halo in my pics I have proven this on Twitter already. Marcelove "proven this on Twitter" https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/b672c337b9ea66b308150a002d3b0e7965c7903f926c609808fe53619dc81cd0.jpg abc More fanboy logic. I took pictures so everything is fine. Anyone who says its not fine is crazy. whispy_snippet How ridiculous. So a blogger takes 22 photos in various conditions and his experience is valid, but my experience of owning the phone and taking hundreds of photos in various conditions is not valid. You guys are weirdos. Marcelove Nope, you are a weirdo saying that from 3 phones ( S7, iPhone 7 and Dead Pixel ) you gave priority to the only one that doesn't have OIS. Worst, you work with photography... I feel for whoever uses your service... whispy_snippet If you did your homework on the way the Pixel captures images you'd know that it doesn't need OIS for still imagery.

If you want to get smarmy I'm happy to school you, mate. thereasoner You're just revealing yourself as a blind hater with your childish name calling of the Pixel. You're perspective is poisoned by the bias your hate provides. Your take on OIS is just another example. Google used high end VR quality sensors on board to assist with EIS and many reviews show excellent results from that as well but you're only interested in those that can give you your hate fix. whispy_snippet Yep, no response. Thought so. thereasoner That says it all right there, these guys are haters doing their thing and they will desperately cling on to any negatives​ they can get while blindly ignoring results from owners in real world conditions. They can't help themselves, it's what they do. Andy But do you see problems with low light pics. I do on my wife's pixel. IPhone Looks so much better. I'm so disappointed whispy_snippet My wife has an iPhone 7. To my eye the Pixel kills the iPhone 7 in low light. In fact in almost every situation it bests the 7. The only area I'd give to Apple's phone is video. thereasoner Yep, and reviews show the same. Apple finally did improve low light performance with the 7 years after everyone else was beating them but the Pixel cameras are considered the best in countless reviews for good reason. Andy Maybe her phone is defected. Pixel photos in the bar this weekend looked orange and iPhone looked normal. Even. You moto z looked better. whispy_snippet Ok Jordan L I'll say that I snap a lot of photos with my Pixel XL.. I have seen the lens flare issue when there is direct full sun at a certain angle on the lens. Rare, but fun to reproduce for Pixel haters. Marcelove "You can choose to believe whatever exaggerated narrative you want " So I choose yours. abc I saw a rainbow once. Oh, are we not just conveying pointless ancedotes? thereasoner Mines been awesome thanks ! mr.fozzo On my Nex6P, I have noticed that the Fingerprint reader has been less reliable lately. It requires more presses than the usual 1 press. Besnik Rrustemi My Nexus 6P working excellent so far, no battery problems, no fingerprint problems (better standby times on 7.1.2 to be honest). But yes,i can agree that fingerprint was much faster when i first got the device on 6.0 Marshmallow (for unlocking the device with the fingerprint) now it takes like 2 full seconds for that :( jimv1983 No issues on my Nexus 5X and the swipe on the sensor to bring down the notification panel is great. Alex Harrison Flashed the OTA myself on my 5X. No issues with it. Jeff Neston At least it is just the sensor. My nexus 5 was bricked by a Google update.. it got the boot loop. Google support lied to me claiming I broke the power button. False it was not broken. I ended up going small claims case against Google. They settled, but wanted me to sign gag order. Sorry, no way. I sent it back and got complete refund. Sneaky company. What probably causes boot loop update to occur is phone on long time. Some apps get memory leak over time. System then unpredictably unstable. Then the system does auto uplate from Google without asking user NOR even rebooting or turning off prior to the update. Then during update, Os gets corrupted. Then after failed update phone reboots thinking the. Update completed. Now phones dead. And Google not bother to address the issue. Pdiddy187 My 5x fingerprint sensor was great until it bootlooped yesterday morning. LG is going to repair it under warranty even though it's well out of warranty. La Kiesha Rodriguez Barrientes I have the ZTE axon 7 and over a month now google hasn't addressed a fix for the play store not loading apps over data or Wi-Fi.. Without uninstalling updates to play store and then maybe will not say "waiting for network" so frustrating and then maybe download once and have to do that everytime.. Dumb.. P. Sherman That's been like that since KitKat. F------ KITKAT. ahnafm Is google reacommodating their customers now? Brett Delia I thought some positive feedback was worth being added. My Nexus 6P is working perfectly after the update. I've had generally a great experience with all my Android phones. I've had an iPhone as well as a Windows mobile phone as well in my past.

Look it up. 2kool4skool Dunno mate, call me bias or whatever, but all these articles do make me a bit paranoid about pixel. whispy_snippet "Confirmation bias, also called confirmatory bias or myside bias, is the tendency to search for, interpret, favor, and recall information in a way that confirms one's preexisting beliefs or hypotheses." Just a quick wiki search. abc Fortunately, not many Pixels have been sold so not many people are affected.

Period. thereasoner I'm glad that your iPhone 6s isn't affected by the many flawed updates and hardware issues​ that have plagued various iPhones over the years but the fact remains that Apple has faced class action lawsuits filed by their own customers for serious issues like Touch Disease and error 53 and for good reason. They have the worst track record of them all and to make things worse they're known for both ignoring iPhone issues until said class action lawsuits are launched and/or blaming their customers for the iPhone hardware/software problems. BTW, my Pixel "hums along swimmingly" as well, that doesn't mean issues with the Pixel don't exist much less those far more serious issues found on iPhones !

I finally got the OTA but am hesitant to update. Wesley I'm having this problem on the Nexus 6P. It won't recognize my fingerprint but I can still use the swipe gesture for notifications... This might be interesting. I went into settings to double check my Android version and tapped it to see the Easter egg (I forgot what it was.). When I noticed it was the stupid cat thing, I also noticed I could turn it off so I did. Now the scanner is recognizing my fingerprint again - not perfectly but it's better than nothing at all.

Helena Smith reports: Barging their way into the finance ministry on Syntagma Square, scores of communist-aligned protestors hung a massive banner from the building’s façade exhorting Greeks to “rise up” and participate in the general strike that will coincide with parliament legislating further cuts and tax increases in exchange for emergency bailout loans next week. The protest, which kicks off a week of work stoppages, strikes and street demonstrations ahead of the vote, kept Tsakalotos locked out of his sixth-floor office for most of the day. Photograph: Helena Smith Standing in front of the finance ministry, Yannis Hiotelis, a retired bank employee said his pension had been already been cut 60 percent. “How do they expect us to survive?” he asked of prime minister Alexis Tsipras’ leftist-led government. “Austerity only leads to unhappiness, disillusionment, bitterness and ultimately friction. We are talking about outright pillage. This government has made a mockery of its own so called leftist politics.” The protest came as the International Monetary Fund appeared to roll back on speculation that it would sign up to the Greek bailout programme before a comprehensive debt deal had been found for the debt-stricken country. Greece is expected to be the focus of talks when the G7 meet over the next few days.

The FTSE has suffered alongside its European and US counterparts, with a relatively stable day turning sour this afternoon. Gold producers Fresnillo and Randgold Resources are the top performers of the day, and it looks like investors are battening down the hatches for now. The downturn in UK economic data over recent months has been there for all to see, yet this morning provided a perfect overview of how British industry is struggling of late. Negative construction output, manufacturing production and industrial production in March goes to show how tough the current business environment is for firms. However, probably the most damning number was the trade balance for goods which showed that despite the boost of a weaker pound, we are seeing consumers continue to focus on imports over domestic products. The Bank of England was the main event today, with Super Thursday providing a pretty predictable set of forecasts alongside a very predictable rate decision. Perhaps the most interesting part of it was the fact that we saw such volatility around the event, with the pound moving sharply lower after the BoE admitted it could be the end of 2019 before we finally see a rate rise. The chance of a rate rise during the long Brexit negotiations was always going to be slim, but Carney said that the speed of rate rises will be determined by how successful those negotiations are. The bank’s upward revisions for inflation and downgrades to growth should be taken with a pinch of salt given the uncertainty provided by the impending election, oil prices and Brexit negotiations. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 10.29am EDT 10:29 It’s turning into a disappointing day for investors, with markets under pressure and the pound underwhelmed by the Bank of England’s comments and the UK data. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: You’d think, with the Bank of England stating that interest rates may rise faster than expected, that sterling would be pretty happy. You’d be wrong. That’s because there was a lot of BoE data to digest this afternoon, and not much of it good. First of all sterling was likely disappointed that Kristin Forbes was the sole MPC member to vote for a rate hike, missing out on the potential hawkish hand rumoured from Michael Saunders. Then there was the slight downward revision to the 2017 GDP forecasts, which were trimmed from 2.0% to 1.9%. Even the pound-positive news that inflation is expected to hit 2.7% in this quarter – a decent whack higher than the 2.4% initially expected – was joined by a warning that average earnings growth will be a mere 2% this year, down from the 3% previously stated 3%, marking a huge fall in real wages and living standards. This left sterling in a rather bad mood, the currency falling half a percent against both the euro and the dollar (with cable now sitting at a one week low). In a rare sight the FTSE took no joy in the pound’s fall, the UK index itself shedding 0.2% to lurk just the wrong side of 7400. Sterling’s slide did have ramifications elsewhere, however; the euro’s gains drove the DAX and CAC lower, the German and French indices dropping half a percent apiece. Over in the US, meanwhile, the Dow Jones finally fell through the 20900 level it has been testing for the past week, plunging 100 points to hit a 2 and a half week nadir. David Jones (@JonesTheMarkets) It's only dropped back to a 4 day low, but biggest sell off we have seen in the US for a while.

So the pound has hit a one week low against the dollar of $1.2851, down around 0.7%. Against the euro it has fallen 0.5% to €1.1838. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 9.07am EDT 09:07 And here’s some City reaction to the Bank of England’s meeting: Howard Archer at IHS Markit: Markedly slower-than-expected UK GDP growth in the first quarter, the snap general election on 8 June, muted earnings growth and early difficult posturing ahead of the start of the Brexit negotiations between the UK and the EU made a pretty compelling argument for the Bank of England to sit tight at the May meeting – even if the Bank of England forecasts show an extended inflation overshoot.. However, we maintain the view that the Bank of England is being too upbeat on the growth outlook with some pretty optimistic assumptions, particularly relating to the likely pick-up in wage growth. We also think Brexit uncertainties will hamper growth. We maintain the view that the Bank of England is highly likely to keep interest rates at 0.25% through 2017 and 2018 - and very possibly beyond. In fact, we do not see the Bank of England edging interest rates up until 2020 given likely prolonged economic and political uncertainties centred on Brexit. However, given major uncertainties over the UK economic outlook nothing can be ruled out on the interest rate front. David Lamb, head of dealing at FEXCO Corporate Payments: The prospect of the pound reaching $1.30 has evaporated after the Bank of England all but confirmed that a rate hike remains as distant a prospect as ever. The Governor may be sounding a touch more hawkish but any instinct he might have to raise interest rates to rein in inflation is being kept firmly in check by the Bank’s unwritten commandment – ‘thou shalt not jeopardise growth’. So while the Inflation Report suggests the Bank’s rate rise conundrum remains finely balanced, in reality the doves continue to rule the roost. For now any hawkish talk remains just that – and there was precious little in the Governor’s press conference or the Report’s small print to suggest any significant shift towards a more hawkish trajectory. None of this is new – but to have it laid bare is a reality check for sterling bulls and the pound is paying the price. Yet the pound’s slide against both the dollar and the euro is still relatively modest and it comes after a strong run, meaning sterling could still end the week stronger than it began it. David Page, Senior Economist at AXA Investment Managers: We still consider risks to the downside of the BoE outlook, currently forecasting growth of 1.7% for this year and 1.2% for next. Accordingly and in the knowledge that much hinges on the outlook for Brexit negotiations, we expect the BoE to continue to tread carefully. While we recognise the risk that the MPC may tighten policy later in 2018 if Brexit negotiations are smooth over the next few years, we argue that in practice the materialisation of some downside risk is likely to leave the MPC keeping its policy rate on hold through the Brexit period and into 2019. Dean Turner, Economist at UBS Wealth Management: “’Super Thursday’ has become ‘Average Thursday’. Given the proximity of the General Election, no fireworks were expected. There were no surprises on the growth and inflation adjustments, but the Bank’s continued confidence in a “smooth” transition to a new deal with the EU stands out given recent news flow. The Bank expects the squeeze on consumers will be offset in part with a better performance by exporters and investment. In our view, the this seems a little optimistic; we expect growth will slow more meaningfully as firms reassess their investment plans while Brexit talks are taking place. Sterling’s immediate drop looks justified. There is little in this report to suggest that the MPC will become more hawkish in the short term, notwithstanding their marginally more upbeat language. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 8.54am EDT 08:54 TUC: Wages must become an election priority Mark Carney’s warning that real wages will shrink this year is an alarm bell for UK politicians, says the TUC. TUC General Secretary Frances O’Grady says workers have already suffered enough since the financial crisis; a second wage squeeze is simply not fair. O’Grady says: “British workers have already suffered the longest pay squeeze since Victorian times. It will worry them that the Bank of England says there is more pain to come this year. “All the political parties must explain in their manifestos how they will give Britain a pay rise. They should start with scrapping the unfair pay restrictions on public servants, which will leave midwives over £3,000 a year worse off in real terms by 2020. And they must commit to boosting the National Minimum Wage to £10 as soon as possible.” Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 8.49am EDT 08:49 Bank of England: What the media say There’s lots of coverage of the Bank of England’s quarterly inflation report. Chris Giles of the Financial Times is struck by Carney’s comments on Brexit: UK interest rates will be able to rise towards more normal levels during the next three years if Theresa May negotiates a “smooth” Brexit, the Bank of England said on Thursday as it published forecasts suggesting that the recent economic slowdown will be temporary. But in a stark warning to the UK prime minister less than one month before the general election, the central bank made it clear that its sanguine forecasts depended on Mrs May coming back from Brussels with a Brexit deal that ensures companies will not have to make sharp adjustments as the UK leaves the EU. FT: BoE says ‘smooth’ Brexit would lead to normalised interest rates In the Telegraph, Szu Ping Chan points out that the Bank’s forecasts are still quite upbeat: Stronger business investment and the ongoing global recovery will ensure economic growth this year remains robust, even as households face the biggest real income squeeze in years, according to the Bank of England. Bank policymakers trimmed their forecast for UK growth this year to 1.9pc due to slower household spending growth. While this is down from 2pc in its February projection, growth is still expected to be higher than 2016, when the economy grew by 1.8pc. Bloomberg’s Jill Ward focuses on the governor’s real wage concerns: Mark Carney warned that U.K. households will face a difficult year, underpinning the Bank of England’s decision to keep interest rates on hold. The pound fell. While the BOE governor said policy makers have assumed the U.K.’s departure from the European Union will unfold smoothly, he noted the uncertainties surrounding that process and said real wage growth will remain weak for now. “This is going to be a more challenging time for households,” Carney said at a press conference in London on Thursday. “Wages won’t keep up with prices for goods and services they consume.” Sterling fell as much as 0.6 percent to the day’s lows and traded at $1.2855 at 1:19 p.m. London time.

Photograph: POOL/Reuters Q: Are your forecasts at risk if stock markets fall back from their current high levels and volatility rises? Mark Carney agrees that volatility is pretty low right now - although sterling volatility is closer to its historic average. He doesn’t have a full explanation for why volatility is so low [the VIX ‘fear index’ hit its lowest since 1993 this week]. Carney also warns that volatility is likely to rise at some point: The world hasn’t become dramatically less uncertain and we can certainly see some potential triggers for increased volatility at some point. And that’s the end of the press conference Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 8.26am EDT 08:26 Q: Your forecasts are build on a smooth Brexit, including a transition forecast. Isn’t that rather optimistic, given Mrs May is heading for a hard Brexit - and that infamous dinner at Number 10 Downing Street? The UK’s stated objective is a bold, comprehensive trade agreement with the EU, and an appropriate transition period. Donald Tusk has said it’s in everyone’s interest to avoid disruption around Brexit. It’s not our place to call those goals into question, Carney says. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 8.24am EDT 08:24 Q: Theresa May wants to reduce immigration below 100,000 per year, which may tighten the labour market and dampen growth. Do you take that into account? Carney does his best to avoid saying anything controversial, explaining that the Bank bases its forecasts on migration projections from the Office for National Statistics, rather than on political promises. And he cites research on the labour supply, that shows that changes in available workers - either due to domestic factors or migration - only has “a relatively limited impact on inflation.” That’s because extra workers may push wages down a little, but that then creates more demand (as there are more people in the economy), and that has a tightening effect. That’s all old news here, Carney concludes with a reassuring grin (the question came from a Dutch journalist). Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 8.19am EDT 08:19 Q: Is it better to leave monetary policy looser for longer, rather than risking tightening too soon? The current stance of monetary policy is ‘appropriate’, Carney replies carefully, dampening the idea that policy is too loose. And he denies that Brexit will prevent the BoE from hiking rates.

The Play Store adopts new app and notification icons with v7.8.16 [APK Download] Cody Toombs Follow View All Posts 2017/05/10 6:25pm PDTMay 10, 2017 110 Plus 1 on G+ 272 Share on Facebook 98 Share on Twitter Total Shares480 Applications Downloads News Google never stops changing things up. A new version of the Play Store app is rolling out to users and it comes with a new icons for the app launcher and notifications. They're simple cosmetic adjustments, but these are the types of things you can't help but notice as soon as they're on your screen. Left: Old version. Right: New version. The new app icon leaves behind the last remnants of the shopping bag icon that came along when Google still called this the Android Market. It is now just the Google Play logo with no other ornamentation. It's worth noting that the round icon variant hasn't changed, so it still looks like the Google Play logo on a dinner plate. Above: Old version. Below: New version. The notification icons have also gone through a little facelift. These also trade away the tote bag motif for the Google Play triangle, but slightly adjusted with the checkmark extending beyond the lines. The notification icons come in different colors for each of the content stores (e.g. apps, books, movies). The notification icon for stacked updates – when more than one app is installed or updated – is no longer a stack of blocks, it's just the same triangle app icon used with single installs. We're still looking for more changes in this update, but it's starting to look like this may be it. If you don't want to wait for Google to send this update out to you, grab it from the APK Mirror link below. Download The APK is signed by Google and upgrades your existing app. The cryptographic signature guarantees that the file is safe to install and was not tampered with in any way. Rather than wait for Google to push this download to your devices, which can take days, download and install it just like any other APK.

Powsniffer0110 4.0 FTW Burak Çalık they are not triangles, its the play icon. leganzish What shape is a play icon? I forget. Hachiko Google play books was perfect with Android 5 but only this one... Android 6 version is almost perfect TechGuy22 New icon every year. They are going to change play Store soon too lol Total Insecurity How do you know that? boop Unless you mean the name, the app just got another design update. sbeaulieu Isn't that the same icon from a couple of years ago? Tom Westrick We've always been at war with Eastasia Captain_Invisible Yeah.. they've used that icon on and off in promotion for a while. 4Ui812 Looks like I'll have to wait until it gets pushed. Apkmirrior won't let me download it (I don't turn off my ad blocker for anyone :-) Gjorgi Lazarovski You can download even with the adblocker on. You just need to wait like 10 sec for the download button to show up. sklatigre Can confirm Cakefish And you get to admire a cool cat. Richard Branches The play store icon on google chrome is still the old one, they should update it as well... https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/bca1aca3fd5b60e08fcd507e7c39b67f23f70ed0e4ff417bcf62881906f7106a.png Тарас Мукин Chrome apps were announced to be removed soon. Don't think they are going to bother. Richard Branches You're right about that, but they still will be available on Chrome OS so why not update it anyway?... Curt Because Google. Spazturtle Won't they be replaced in Chrome OS by Android app support? Richard Branches No, they won't... Tom Westrick If they wait long enough it'll just be back to that logo C64 Thank god / satan (choose your preference) for icon packs Konrad Krawczuk Icon packs are always kinda problem to me. If you have a few without icon from icon pack you must always fight with inconsistency. Powsniffer0110 Yes! I'm too freaking anal about this so I cannot use icon pack​s :( xyz Neither. C64 Sorry forgot the Atheist Jose Romero Google IO can't come sooner. Devin Studios Looks kinda boring compared to the old icon. Breathless So wait what happened to circles?... Cody Toombs Circles are there on the Pixel and in any other situation where the round icons are chosen. The triangle icon shows up on everything else. Anton Kuznetsov Triangles is the new circles burkett375 Since they love to A/B test, make 7 different message apps, etc....they should make 3 competing app stores/markets/hubs Ben Godfrey Don't give them any "good" ideas ;) Marcelove It doesn't matter... Google's employees are paid to keep an eye here at AP ... But it must be chimpanzees, because even with the clear feedback about stupid decisions they got here, they still don't give a f*ck and keep the screw route. Sumeet Deshmukh People who paid a lot of money to Google aren't getting these icon updates, the pixel guys mattcoz Because our icons already dropped the shopping bag, no need for an update. Sumeet Deshmukh I was a little sarcastical, I love my pixel (styled rom on my Nexus 5 (not x) Victor Stuber ya, but we got crappy white circles around all our icons. It sucks Leon I like my circles personally. sklatigre Gonna miss the shopping bag notification, kinda liked it. global etest You can keep it easily by icon packs.. sklatigre Didn't know icon packs can change the notification icons also. Margaritas Ante Porcos Google is a mess in everything. Mr. DICKHEAD it was always a mess.. Berkay Anyone else dislike both the circled icon and just the icon by itself? I prefer the shopping bag... It looks the best IMO. Thomas I loved the Android Market icon. Made so much sense SavageJeep What is Android Market? /s Salis Before Google Play branding, the app store used to he simply called Android Market. NooSH it looks like crap and i'm glad they are getting rid of it. Berkay So you prefer a simple triangle over a shopping bag? It looks horrible lol. TheDrunkenClam Completely agree. Google's whole ad campaign about Android was "be together, not the same". And then they make literally all of their icons the same by putting them in boring white circles. All in an effort to copy apple. I love the different sized and shaped icons of Android. Not a good look, Google. Jesse Kawell Once you see that notification icon "checkmark" ✅ as a 3D post lying down at an angle, you can never unsee it. BoFiS Aww, that's sad, and almost unrecognizable now since I still call mine "Market" on my homescreen... Branko Proof that Google lost the plot. reCoded So, the circle icon is the same I guess? Martin Let me read the article for you: "It's worth noting that the round icon variant hasn't changed, so it still looks like the Google Play logo on a dinner plate." Anton Kuznetsov This localization of 'update all' button text is awful https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/57e6791db8965bf1e13f4f50e3b6b5b303644e9c3f1660799bf9896ed1ef57b3.png Exalm ОМГ. Это именно в новой версии вот так? Captain_Invisible That's your crazy language's fault. Vitias R. No it's not. Have a nice day. thunderqus Only if I can find what you are talking about in English and posting screen in "who knows which" language. Vitias R. It says "Update your apps right today". I think that "Обновить все" is enough. Konrad Krawczuk Why it is not something like "обновить все" ? YuCMi Jesus christ Google. What sin did the previous icon commit? Was it too old for you guys? Grey Very ugly and hard to understand. Not intuitive at all. But I guess that's Google 2017! Lawstorant Looks generic af. Really Google? WTF? Maybe just go back to HOLO then? DragoCubed The new icon is nice but the icon in the notification bar isn't so nice. The one thing I don't like about losing the bag is the icon not representing a store. xyz OMG! TRIANGLE! NO CIRCLE? Like if you don't give a flying F about icon shapes. LOL I want circle, niggа! LOL New icon! Fuсk YEAH! Paul Teale Not circular then, not really following their own guidelines are they Kieron Quinn The round icon is round, the non-round icon is not. They're following their guidelines just fine Erimaru What about round icon? Curt I actually like this icon the most. Martin Spierings I already got complaints from people that didn't identify the play store or play icon with app store. So how the hell would this help people? They should realize that most people don't understand the connection google is looking for. Play is used for movies/film or games, not apps. The bag-background at least gave some indication on what to expect. The new one will get lots of people (those not really experienced with Android or mobile in general) to get their apps from there. These things should be self explanatory. And Google should drop the Play name (plus icon). Its a stupid name already. avnow well I used to get this icon pack, not exactly but close to this with an icon pack, this icon looks crisp! //moumon Meh.. I'm still using Elta icon pack :v That's one of the reason why I love android... Customize to meet your expectations <3 jcopernicus Awesome. A play button for purchases! Makes sense! Ra1nb0wD4sh DE Press Start to shut down Windows. :D (Not relevant anymore, I know) Ruben Tavano On the lateral menu the apps section was in the old green and with this update it has been updated to match the new green of the whole play store Alexander Reddicks The icon has been updated to support the new "adaptive" icon style being showcased next week. https://developer.android.com/preview/features/adaptive-icons.html Mr. DICKHEAD This is dumb theres nothing new I like the bodybag version.. but the naked one alone? seriously..?! David Onter The new icon looks HUGE next to the others. It doesn't seem to follow the spacing guidelines? Marcelove Google' employee : "Let's change an icon the people are used to and know for many years to something that doesn't improve anything." Google's executives : "Genius!” Biga173rd They can't make up their minds. madmaglio Finally. I've been replacing the bag icon with my own version of this for years. so much cleaner. VirtualWave I kinda hate it, it looks overly large and gaudy. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/d5821ea6199d4b4d1b5b7fa7fb41a252ab810c809090eb00f133b88f741b1735.png Follow Android Police 1.49M 468k 143k 115k Latest Deals 4 [Deal Alert] Get the LG Urbane 2nd Edition for $171.99 on eBay 2017/05/11 8:04pm PDTMay 11, 2017 4 [Deal Alert] Get 10,000 Amazon Appstore coins for $65 ($35 off) through May 25th 2017/05/11 1:34pm PDTMay 11, 2017 27 T-Mobile to offer 'buy one, get one' deal on Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus starting tomorrow (May 12th) 2017/05/11 12:52pm PDTMay 11, 2017 7 [Deal Alert] Huawei Watch in Jewel/Pearl $220 at Amazon ($330 off) 2017/05/10 7:32pm PDTMay 10, 2017 30 [Update: Deal ended] [Featured Deal Alert] Caseology is offering its new cases for the Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus to Android Police for as little as $5.99 for a limited time [Sponsored] 2017/05/10 2:39pm PDTMay 10, 2017 Latest Poll Do you use a screen protector on your phone?

Organising your files might not seem like a psychedelic experience now, but in 1968, when Douglas Engelbart first demonstrated a futuristic world of windows, hypertext links and video conferencing to a rapt audience in San Francisco, they must have thought they were tripping. Especially because he was summoning this dark magic onto a big screen using a strange rounded controller on the end of a wire, which he called his “mouse”. Like many California tech visionaries of the time, Engelbart was an enthusiastic advocate for the mind-expanding benefits of LSD. As head of the Augmented Human Intellect Research Center at the Stanford Research Institute, he and his team would drop acid under test conditions in the hope of inspiring new breakthroughs. His own technological epiphanies while tripping seem to have been limited: in one session, after staring at a blank wall in fascination for hours, he came up with the “tinkle toy”, a potty-training aid in the form of a miniature water wheel that would spin and tinkle when peed on. But he remained convinced that the drug opened doors to alternative realities, including one where people could control computers through screens. Facebook Twitter Pinterest This way to the future … a page from Susan Kare’s sketchbook. Photograph: kareprints.com/Design Museum In a grainy black and white film of his 1968 conference demonstration – since known in the tech hall of fame as “The Mother of All Demos” – Engelbart calmly introduces the embryonic forms of what would become word processing, email, Skype and Google Docs, all shown on a screen with scalable windows controlled by a mouse. For computer scientist Alan Kay, who would go on to develop these ideas at the Xerox PARC research institute, it changed everything. “The demo was one of the greatest experiences of my life,” he later said. “To me, it was Moses opening the Red Sea. It reset the whole conception of what was reasonable to think about in personal computing.” Engelbart’s video will be on display in the London Design Museum’s forthcoming exhibition, California: Designing Freedom, a show that aims to shine a kaleidoscopic spotlight on the cross fertilisation of counterculture and tech culture on America’s “left coast” over the last 50 years. “Think of ‘California design’ and you tend to think of Charles and Ray Eames and the world of mid-century modernism,” says curator Justin McGuirk. “We wanted to focus on what came next, and show how the hippie movement combined with the hacker culture to develop tools of personal liberation.” From skateboards and LSD blotting paper tabs to iPhones and Google’s self-driving car, the exhibition will unpick the west coast ethos that has fostered the development of devices for escapism and self-sufficiency. It shows how, as frontier territory on the edge of a continent, California has always incubated a culture of self-reliance and reinvention, as a place that attracts people fond of fantasy, freedom and rebellion – and how they have mobilised design to meet these ends. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Friendly face … Susan Kare’s Mac welcome icon greeted users booting up. Photograph: kareprints.com/Design Museum The development of user interface design is one of the most fascinating threads in the story, and one of the least obvious, because it has become second nature to us all. “These things now seem so intuitive,” says co-curator Brendan McGetrick, “that a computer document looks like a white piece of paper with text on it, that it sits on an office-like ‘desktop’, that you delete things by dragging them into a trash can. It didn’t have to be this way – these are the results of specific design decisions.” The now-ubiquitous desktop metaphor first emerged from Kay’s Xerox PARC work in the form of the Alto computer in 1973, and later the Star in 1981, the first device to use windows, icons and drop-down menus. It is shown in the exhibition as an early mock-up with pieces of paper pasted on to a slate. On a tour of the Xerox facility in 1979, a 24-year-old Steve Jobs was captivated. “I thought it was the best thing I’d ever seen in my life,” he said. “Within 10 minutes, it was obvious to me that all computers would work like this someday.” It turned out that Jobs, Steve Wozniak and his hippie chums from the Homebrew Computer Club, who together founded Apple in 1976, had a better knack for communicating the potential of this new technology than the corporate folks at Xerox. A quick comparison of their TV adverts tells you everything you need to know about the importance of design and marketing to the commercial fate of the two companies. While the 1981 ad for the Xerox Star is set in a workaday office, and methodically explains how the computer will revolutionise secretarial work and filing, Apple’s 1984 commercial for the first Macintosh was a thrilling teaser directed by Ridley Scott, showing a room of grey human automatons being lectured by a Big Brother figure on a big screen – which is then dramatically shattered by dashing female athlete hurtling a big hammer. Apple, it seemed to say, would provide salvation. The Mac would be the disruptive tool to achieving ultimate personal freedom. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Alternative realities … LSD tabs with a California design. Photograph: Design Museum In the grid-ruled notebooks of graphic designer Susan Kare, also on show, it is possible to see how Apple understood the importance of humour and familiarity in translating something that had always been the preserve of big corporations and the military into something people would welcome into their homes – and be able to understand. Kare famously developed the smiling Mac icon, displayed as the computer booted up, along with the lasso, paint-bucket and trash can, transforming the cold and intimidating early desktop computers into something friendly. The Apple 1’s handmade wooden case, also on show, was a direct link to the hippie, maker culture of the communes. It is a theme that continued in the “skeuomorphic” design of Apple icons and software, with digital tools aping their real-world counterparts, be it calculator buttons or the yellow squares of sticky Post-it notes. In a world where our smartphones are often the first things we touch in the morning and the last things we touch at night, and toddlers grow up pinching and swiping before they can read, priorities have changed. As Apple’s chief designer Jony Ive recalls, when he and his team sat down to redesign the iPhone operating system in 2012, it did away with many of the classic skeuomorphic elements: “We understood that people had already become comfortable with touching glass, they didn’t need physical buttons, they understood the benefits. So there was an incredible liberty in not having to reference the physical world so literally. We were trying to create an environment that was less specific. It got design out of the way.” Facebook Twitter Pinterest Having ignored design for a decade, Google recently united the graphical language of its different platforms with the launch of Material Design. In an exhibit that comes as a surprising time-warp, the paper and cardboard mock-ups of its new icons are on show, revealing how the design team modelled the new interface and developed lighting rigs to cast accurate shadows, with the aim of creating an illusion of layers of paper-like cards sliding around inside your device. It was a process that produced some interesting outcomes: why should buttons appear to press down when you touch the screen, when there’s no sense of pressing something beyond the glass? So instead they hover upwards, as if subject to a magical magnetic attraction from your finger. With Silicon Valley tech companies pumping increasingly hefty resources into voice recognition technology, McGetrick says the next frontier for user interface will be aural, building on our new surreal world of people shouting across the room to summon help from Siri, Alexa and Cortana. “We’re entering a new phase where we decreasingly need screens,” he says. “The trajectory of miniaturisation is crystal clear, from computers to laptops to digital organisers to phones to watches. The end-game is that technology will become invisible and we’ll have Google inside our heads.” California: Designing Freedom is at the Design Museum, London, 24 May–15 October.

[Minority Report] Google and Coca-Cola may target personalized ads at you - in real life Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/05/10 11:27am PDTMay 10, 2017 23 Plus 1 on G+ 45 Share on Facebook 49 Share on Twitter Total Shares117 News Videos Google and Coca-Cola's partnership effort for in-store advertising displays looks to be bearing fruit. The advertising system uses DoubleClick's preference and tracking data combined with Google's Beacon Platform to serve up targeted ads by pulling data from passing smartphones. With that info, displays are able to select content based on your preferences in the form of advertisements specifically targeted to passersby. In a recent grocery store pilot program the Minority Report-style ads performed quite very well. This isn't actually that new. It was discussed at a few places in the last couple months since the details were revealed at Google's conference. But, it seems to have quite effectively flown under the radar for that time, considering how cool it is. Coca-Cola made a detailed post about it on one of their social promotion sites in April as well, in which they talked about the potential environments for these tracking signage systems, like movie theaters and other Retail venues than just grocery stores. Google's partnership with Coca-Cola for this system has been discussed off-and-on for a few years. Back at the National Automatic Merchandising Association's OneShow in 2016 Google talked about the potential as applied to vending machines, and said that Google and Coca-Cola were working together on Bluetooth beacons for vending, but this is the first time I've actually gotten to see what it looks like and how it performs. Coca-Cola's Greg Chambers, at Google's recent Cloud Next Conference, said that it has been experimenting with small tests into proximity marketing since at least 2015 when they first started working with Google on a prototype. The two companies tested things with a pilot for the system in 250 Albertson's grocery stores, in which Coca-Cola saw some incredible results. There was a one year ROI on Coca-Cola products displayed by the system, and a spillover effect from so-called "category-lift," in the form of a total one-month ROI for all nearby soda products — i.e., this system sells a lot of soda for Coca-Cola and all other brands near it. There's no word yet on when or how Coca-Cola might roll this out to other stores, but given how positive the results were for the pilot tests, it is likely you'll see one someday at the end of the soda aisle in your local grocery. On a more technical note, I'm not sure exactly what sort of data is being sent to the displays by nearby phones or how it is taken. Allegedly the system uses Google's Eddystone beacons, which exchange information with nearby phones using Bluetooth low energy. This is the first time I've heard of Google's Beacon Platform actually being used, combined with DoubleClick's targeting advertising systems, to target people in the physical world. The privacy-conscious might express some concern at the potential of having your phone communicate your preferences to an in-store display, but I would hope and assume that any identifying information is stripped out. Either way, we're one step closer to this. Source: Digital Strategy Consulting Tags beacon platform beacons bluetooth low energy Coca-Cola Eddystone Targeted advertisements video subscribe ...

Anu6is Stop being absurd, how else would you know what you NEED? WesleySmalls Actually, you do. People require social interaction, it's a very strong part of our being. Humans generally don't like to be alone, and very much can't over longer periods of time. Because of this, people tend to follow each other's example in one way or another, advertising is just one of the many examples Ben Yeah, your phone communicating with a vending machine to give you personalised advertisements is not in any way 'social interaction'. WesleySmalls I did not say anything about that, it wasn't even remotely close, nor was the post I commented on. But of course, else you had to actually comment on my actual post, and realize that it's true that people follow other people Prezes Dyrektor But you are making it sound like advertising is indispensable in our lives. Well guess what, ads is the reason why I cut cable tv, they don't have those fancy adblockers. Ads is the reason I mostly listen to local academic radio without any. Etc. Ads and marketing are evil, and we are being manipulated every day. Now excuse me as I run to grab some sugar soda and candy. xyz Your second sentence was "People require social interaction". It seems you didn't bother reading your own comment. WesleySmalls Indeed, that was a art of my comment, which was a reply to a comment that wasnt about any digital technologies. Ryne Hager https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKlSVNxLB-A xyz "Humans generally don't like to be alone, and very much can't over longer periods of time." Right, that's why we have these things called friends and family. I mean if ads are your way making the loneliness go away, good for you. WesleySmalls It wasnt really difficult to grasp that advertisement uses these relationships and human behavior to advertise their product Avishek GSkynet: Resistance is Futile https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/eceea630e7e43621ded725c3914bdc7a06d9b153943c3512fb6b0f0eeff75d71.png Bryan Does it just give a different Coke commercial based on my tastes? Or are people going to start getting ads for the sex toys they have in their amazon cart? Bane✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ There's one way to find out.

Ryne Hager I actually haven't seen one in my area yet, when I go out west in a month I'll see if I can drop by an Albertson's. Carlos Rodríguez So, you have sex toys in your cart, right? Ryne Hager Obviously not enough sex toys, if you're questioning that. Carlos Rodríguez “( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)” yochanan Albertson's are now all Safeway's, FYI. Ryne Hager Albertson's acquired Safeway back in 2015, indeed. yochanan Right, but it wasn't until fairly recently (at least in Northern CO) that Albertsons stores have been converted into Safeway's. Francesco Lorenzet i suppose they will have a whitelist Bane✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Well, I'm a blank slate to advertising. I might as well be a ghost. I block all ads, turn off all targeted options everywhere, and never click on any. I guess I'll have to turn off Bluetooth when I'm in stores now too. Fadakar lol if you think your record is clean you need to re-evaluate how seriously you want to take privacy. James F This. People underestimate how much of a digital footprint they leave, even if they do turn off everything. EowynCarter True. And if they are, they wouldn't show me ads for coca cola, I just don't like that. And sodas in general. Cakefish Agreed, if I have to endure advertising it might as well be about products that actually interest me. Bewear I am a fan of your picture edits, Ryne. Ryne Hager What a coincidence, I am also a fan of your work. I kept a Bewear in my party for most of Moon. Anu6is lol! Lord Argyris My party was boring. Two of them were from Gen I, and apart from my starter, only one other member was from Gen VII. Now really, Nintendo should get in on this whole Coke-Google partnership thing. Maybe put something in their 3DS games that ties into this advertising platform. "Oh, so you're raising a bunch of Fire-type Pokemon. I'll bet you're feeling pretty hot right about now. Know what would cool you right down? A nice, ice cold COKE." Ryne Hager I mean, with the launch event Munchlax and Munchlax/Snorlax available on the first island, who in their right mind didn't take a Gen I Snorlax to end game. Michael Oghia I came here just to give you a +1 for Hypno Toad. Steve Actually noticed this happening to me recently when near the vending machine at my job. Guessing the capabilities will be endless and more diverse when full-on set-ups are placed everywhere. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/7ea9fde9939850ddee856f08d34c3e8a98a6c90461c779f049060ec4e655b8c6.png https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/f87dc3afe5a1492c33e179552b9fcf3259d388ef4a1a6cfed7951d9612faeae6.png https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/da689e538e0681368f0ef1dac408a796aa111781564a9ded426c4639fbeab351.jpg F4LL0U7 Disabling Nearby will disable invasive ads, you say? Done! Morten Ulv Google usually have a way to opt out. james fuston https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPGgTy5YJ-g Ben Nothing better than a new way to sell people tooth-rotting, diabetes-causing sugar water. Nicholas Conrad *This* is the gateway to AR! Aing actual R; genius! abqnm Are these connected to the "Nearby" activity in Google Settings? (Which also interestingly enough at some point has earned the ability to add the Nearby activity directly to the homescreen. Don't know when it appeared as I don't open that screen often, but it's now an option in the overflow menu.) James F Beacons typically use Bluetooth. abqnm Yes, and Google's Nearby uses Bluetooth LE scanning and Play Services location. But with Google being a part of it, I'm asking if it is directly related to the Nearby function. I am not asking for how beacons typically work. MJ Double checked BT is off on my phone... The only time ever use it is when play music on a BT speaker which I don't do when grocery shopping. "With that info, displays are able to select content based on your preferences in the form of advertisements specifically targeted to passersby" How does these ads work exactly? I am not watching a 54min video. Dedren You don't need bluetooth on per say. It just uses that tech. I believe you will have to enable Nearby places, which is disabled by default but will probably be enabled by default in the future. MJ Nearby places will not be going on... F4LL0U7 I'm not sure they could develop an ad that's targeted enough to get me to buy Coke. F4LL0U7 I guess I might consider it if the vending machine held a family member hostage or something. James F I don't know if I should be concerned that you said *might* consider it.... F4LL0U7 What can I say, I'm just not very receptive to ads. Dedren What about Water, Sprite, SimplyOrange, Powerade, Minute Maid? Surely one of those you drink...all Coke. F4LL0U7 I mean, of course I drink water, but I get it from the filtered pitcher in my fridge. No to the others. xyz You regularly purchase water from the Coca-Cola company? May I also say, I've never heard of SimplyOrange and Powerade. I had no idea that diabetes and obesity came in so many flavors. Adrian quickest way to turn me off on a product. Bluetooth is only on in my car anyway so good luck with it. As soon as someone figures out how to spoof it and annoy people in public, it will go away. Max Johnson I thought it's been NFC and GPS all this time. At least from my Android Pay app. Adrian I don't leave either on when I'm not using them so it's probably a non-issue for me then. blindexecutioner I would literally break my phone if I got an ad as I walked by a pop machine (or whatever) if I couldn't opt out of it of course.. I would switch to iOS that day. If it happened on iOS I would stop using smart phones altogether. tehboogieman You could just turn off bluetooth. Or you know, there's your way rndusrnm479461 iOS also supports this same thing. rndusrnm479461 I've read the whole article and even watched some of that video and I still don't get it - what do your "preferences" affect in the ads? How will it affect what the ad displays? Does it just play the ad you're more likely to prefer from 5 different ads? I'm confused... Why is such system necessary for something simple like coke? Would make more sense for a bus stop ad or other kinds of billboards. Joey1058 I hate to tell you folks this, but I've been out in the wilderness preaching this for at least a good 10 years, if you go by my 2007 blog post: http://joey1058.blogspot.com/2007/07/robots-dreams-is-vending-machine-robot.html Cakefish ALL GLORY TO THE HYPNOTOAD!!! xyz Damn, you got me. I have no choice now but to buy a Pepsi. psuedonymous "On a more technical note, I'm not sure exactly what sort of data is being sent to the displays by nearby phones or how it is taken." BLE Beacons are transmit-only. In order for a piece of ad signage to get any information from you, the chain works like this: BLE beacon emits location. Phone detects beacon, is informed that it is near location. Software on phone then queries backend platform (Google's Beacon platform in this case) to see if there is anything it needs to do with this new knowledge. This could be displaying a popup message, or in this case the phone itself does nothing. Instead, since Google's service has learnt your phone is near a beacon (geographically it cares not, this is logical nearness rather than necessarily physical nearness) so contacts the beacon owner with "Anonuser is nearby who hits your preset filter for Target users" (e.g. users who like coke, users who are above a certain age, users who have not previously pinged this beacon, etc). 'Anonuser' could be a unique but nonpersonal hash, a semi-persistant hash (e.g. for each ad client only), a time-limited persistant hash (e.g. valid for only a certain period before changing, probably just for the single proximity session), or just no hash at all so the ad client cannot track individual users. There may be an avenue for the ad client to pass a message back to google who can then pass it onto the user, without the ad client knowing who the user is.

Google may be sued over Nexus 6P early shutdown and bootloop issues Scott Scrivens View All Posts 2017/04/14 11:09am PDTApr 14, 2017 134 Plus 1 on G+ 316 Share on Facebook 84 Share on Twitter Total Shares534 Android OS Legal Marshmallow 6.0 News Nexus 6P The Android hardware space is fast beginning to look like a watered down episode of Suits. Following on from news earlier in the week that LG is facing a bootloop lawsuit regarding several of its phones, Huawei's Nexus 6P could be responsible for Google encountering a similar inconvenience. As well as being accused of the same bootloop problem that has blighted LG devices, there are reports from consumers that the Nexus 6P has a premature battery shutdown problem. We reported late last year that certain Huawei Nexus 6Ps were suffering from the early shutdown problem, causing them to die with as much as 60% battery still indicated. Now, law firm Chimicles & Tikellis LLP is investigating the possibility of bringing a class action lawsuit against Google on behalf of customers who have faced this issue. Also included in any potential suit would be the same bootloop issue that has also affected owners of the LG Nexus 5X. The problems have mostly been reported by users running Android 7.0 Nougat, but there are also claims that backpedalling to Marshmallow 6.0 on the same devices doesn't fix anything. Neither Google nor Huawei seems to be taking either responsibility or action to resolve issues such as these. While Google is aware of the problems, having assigned both the shutdown and bootloop issues in its tracker, its official position is that those affected by the issue should reach out to customer support for a replacement device. But customers going directly to Huawei about the fault are also out of luck, as they are being told that the problem is with the software and not the hardware, and thus not an issue covered by the manufacturer's warranty - whether it's still in date or not. This is a very frustrating situation for the consumer when neither company seems willing to investigate properly or hold their hands up. Let us know in the comments if any of you Nexus 6P owners have experienced either issue. We'll report back with any further developments as they come in.

Thankfully our Ombudsman financially bullies the carrier until we get a resolution in Australia. Got a free refurb replacement, hopefully won't suffer the same. Matthew Hanson Mine seems to love to die around 10%. As a few others have stated, the low power notification will appear, I will use it for a few minutes and then it powers off. The battery history shows this steep cliff falloff after beginning the recharging and power on. Melad360 i always saw my 6p shut off as soon as the power saving mode came on at 15% battery. this started to happen after an update, i think 7.0 or 7.1, never happened before that though Latheryin This really is a software issue with what they ship out to nexus devices. It also effects the nexus 6 from Motorola. Seems every nexus device that got 7.x has this issue. Packer Backer Nope, doesn't affect the Nexus 6. Provide some links or just don't comment. Latheryin Sorry not a baby sitter. Why not do some research before you post. Also might want to look at the source code and try to understand what you are talking about before posting. abrasive I myself did start to see this issue after about a year, but the device was easily replaced for another warranty-related issue. I would assume my clock was started over again. Not that I haven't seen the same problem on computers with old batteries, but I would hope to get substantially more mileage out of a battery. Nexus 6p Issues Its about time! There are so many issues with the Google branded phones, it doesn't make any sense. We have already reached out to the firm to provide any support they need in accomplishing their potential goal of this class action lawsuit. Its time someone sticks up for the consumers who have been ripped off by this multi-billion dollar company. In the mean time, please follow us on Twitter and sign our petition at Change.org regarding this very issue. We have a lot of signatures and would appreciate your's and your share as well. Thank you in advance! 3fren I'm seeing so many comments about the battery issue going away with just replacing it. I guess I have to give it try. I'm always cautious when it comes to replacing a OEM battery with a replica though. Doug The early shutdown has been an issue on my Nexus 6P ever since I upgraded to Android 7. This has been a frustrating experience - I cannot trust the phone to not die on me when I need it and find myself constant carrying an external battery pack so I can start my phone back up if it dies. P. Sherman Just get an iPhone. It has SIGNIFICANTLY LESS DEVASTATING defects and actually functional software Quality Control team. thereasoner Lol, iOS is the worst when it comes to software issues and iPhone hardware is junk. No Google devices have yet to suffer the nightmares that were error 53 and Touch Disease much less the related class action lawsuits against Apple because of them! Are you trying to be funny? P. Sherman Yeah, no Android devices have had to deal with Touch Disease or error 53. Instead, they spontaneously combust (Note 7,) bootloop for no reason at all (ALL LG'S,) have glass backs that pop out when exposed to a little heat (Xperia Z2 and Z3,) have nearly unusable Bluetooth connectivity (Pixel, Xperia Z5,) heat so badly you can cook an egg on it (every Android that had a massive update,)... I could go on! I'm simply stating that iOS has historically been significantly less buggy and disastrous than Android when a new update rolls around (Think the disaster that was KitKat to Lollipop. The transition from iOS 6 to 7 was SIGNIFICANTLY less dramatic than that in terms of bugs and drains.) Also, Have an open mind and stop automagically trashing the iPhone. The iPhone may be lacking significantly in some areas, but it has two significant advantages - USABILITY AND LONGEVITY. thereasoner Correct, any serious issues facing Android phones have been a one off affecting only one model out of dozens of different models/manufacturers while both device bricking issues found in recent iPhones in error 53 and touch disease affected a much smaller base of phones and just one manufacturer . All the other minor issues you mentioned, be they real or exaggerated, are also very similar to minor issues various iPhones have faced as well its just that it's even worse for iPhones because there are so few models from one manufacturer(and they're still worse) vs several dozens models from over a dozen different manufacturers. That's how bad iPhones are when they have more serious issues despite producing so few models. Issues with Android phone should dwarf those of iPhones by a huge margin considering how many models /manufacturers are involved but they don't, the iPhones still manage to be worse! It's mind boggling when you think about but that's how bad Apple quality is these days. Jon Puhl My 6P is absolutely absurd. It shuts down as high up as 51%, and almost always when the battery percentage is lower than 30%. I'm really upset about this, because it's Google's last Nexus flagship, and it can't even last a full two years without having this dumb battery problem. Daniel Orchard I got a full refund for my 6p, and bought a pixel xl, was out of pocket a little for the upgrade but device was just out of warranty so im still happy with the outcome. Props to Google store support. Yeah i still l got charged the pixel while waiting for the refund, took about 2 weeks to come through but they organised the return shipping etc just like an rma. Im actually really happy. Mine would shutdown between 15-30% and i only lived with that for 2 weeks before starting the process of fixing it. Yes it happened after moving to 7.0 and yes rolling back to 6.x did not fix it so im convinced its software, nfi why they havent rolled out a fix yet. I suggest doing the same because all replacement n6p are still vulnerable to the bug afaik. Morenicano Just wanna make sure I follow, You saying you had your 6P for more than a year and they authorized a refund? I ask because I just reached them for an exchange but if I can get a refund and upgrade to the Pixel, I'll do it. Morenicano Just a heads up, JUST I contacted Google through the support tab in the settings of my 6P and they warranty replaced both mine and my wife's 6P and we bought them through Project Fi in November 2015 with no extended warranty. They said it's a known issue and setup the replacement with no problem and it has next (business) day shipping for the new one and you send the old one back once you have the new one up and running. They do put a hold for the value of the phone on your card while they wait for the old one to come back but they don't charge you Cory Wilson Crybabies. Seriously, my phone developed the issue last week, contacted Google, now I'm rocking a brand new Nexus 6p. Luckily I happened to be on the last day of my warranty but I also got protect so even if I was out of warranty I wasn't paying another $500 again. Just call Google instead of your lawyers dumb asses Packer Backer Wow, a snowflake playing Internet tough guy. Brandon Andrews I had my Nexus 6P become bricked by the bootloop issue. I bought my phone through Best buy and was still well within my 1 year manufacturer warranty when the problem occurred. Unfortunately when I called Best buy customer service and asked how to take care of the situation they told me to send it to this company called Jeg & Sons to get the problem reviewed and a replacement. Needless to say there was like a month long ordeal of mix ups with this company before they finally sent my phone back and told me they don't deal with my phone. Finally I eventually figured out I needed to send my phone to Huawei and they replaced my phone no problem. Sarah Despars I've never had this issue with my 6p so far. Hopefully it doesn't start! k_nonymous I experience this exact same problem and it drives me nuts. Battery saver mode on my 6P is supposed to be activated at 15% battery. The phone shuts off before it ever gets to that point. Also, 95% battery life is equivalent to 1h 5m???? Packer Backer Well well, according to thereasoner he thinks it's your fault. gparmar76 This is 100% hardware related...If it was the OS, it would be a widespread issue across all Android 7 handsets...Huawei is using cheap batteries... People who like the phone should go buy a replacement from a company like Zero Lemon (if available)..Or just buy another stock battery. Kirkster My Nexus 6P is 11 months old, and so far the only anomaly I've had is that it spontaneously factory-reset while in my pants pocket about two weeks ago, which was annoying. I recovered from the cloud backup, which restored all my apps, settings, etc, and my photos were set to back up to Google photos. I lost my call log and SMS messages though, but luckily most of my messaging is via WhatsApp (which restored everything). Still, annoying. I now have a SMS+call log app installed in case it happens again. No battery problems *yet*, now I'm dreading the one-year mark, after reading all the comments. Chalet_Badger My 6P bootloops, i can get it to start normally when the battery is ~5% or so but it will freeze and start to bootloop about a minute or two after. Duane I've had no issue with my 6p. Sounds like an annoying issue from the comments here. Robert B I've been having this problem for a few months now...I carry external battery around all the time because you never know when it feels like it's going to shut off and not turn back on Packer Backer According to thereasoner, it's your fault. clarence jones My 6p did not have the random shutdown at a certain percent issue before. After the 7.1.2 update it would crash and restart when the camera app was opened. About two days after the update it started boot looping and nothing i have tried has gotten it to successfully boot again. Packer Backer Tell thereasoner because he thinks it's your fault. Spudos Woah I thought this was just me. My ending battery life varies wildly, sometimes dying at 15% and on bad days dying around 40-50%. I would replace the battery myself but the teardown process looks like it requires an electrical engineering degree. Packer Backer thereasoner thinks it's your fault. Maybe you should straighten him out. Đức Thành Maybe Google deserves to be sued. Kyle Zess I am plagued by this issue. My phone shutdown after 5 minutes of non charging use. Packer Backer thereasoner thinks it's your fault. David Vogt Only time mine would shut down early at 30% or less is if I was out in freezing cold weather, phone just didn't like freezing weather, keep it warm and it's fine blueman24 Just admit it that your "quick charge" bs killed the battery early. Truth hurts huh My Nexus 6p 128 was barely a year old and it never recovered from the bootloop issue where it would keep restarting and not getting past the Google screen then restart over and over, losing precious pictures and videos of my children. My sister's Nexus 5 eventually broke from the bootloop issue 3 months later. We both had the $80 warranty but it seemed unfair having to pay for a replacement REFURBISHED Nexus 6p when the damage was caused by bad software. Sucked how although Nexus/Google/Huwei knew of ongoing repeated problems a 6 -9 months earlier, yet FAILED to try to resolve or prevent the recurring boot loop issue from infecting more phones. Finally, a lawsuit is in place. Damani Boyce After 7.1.1 update my Nexus 6p got bootloop an can't be fixed shame on them not even a reply from Google or Huawei. thereasoner Many on here are saying that they had no problem getting it fixed/replaced. Packer Backer Yeah, it's ALL his fault.... Posts like yours make some people dream of twisting your head off. thereasoner Why would you say it's his fault? Smoking one to many fatties?, Lol. Razed Mine currently dies at around 10%. I use it moderately and have had it since launch. Got Nexus Protect, but that seems worthless as all reports are that using that service will just get me an even worse battery. thereasoner My Pixel has been great, I'll have to ask a friend at work about his 6p to see if he's having issues. By the sounds of it only a small percentage of devices are affected. Packer Backer Nexus 6 by Motorola was a better direction. Gordon Mine would shut off at 25% consistently. I called Huawei and they actually replaced the battery for free. I had to pay for shipping 1 way, but the covered the rest. I got my phone December 2015, and it was just replaced this February. ThEGr33k Which country? Gordon Canada Trey Bradshaw I haven't encountered any bootlooping and my phone doesn't shut off unless my battery drops to about 2%. olivrstal happens to my 6p quite a bit as well :( hope it's gonna make it till the pixel 2 comes out :D mrjoeyloke My wife just got the bootloop of death on her 6p. I think that might be a whole different issue though. Kuldeep Choudhary This happens when a gaint company like google hires a Chinese company to manufacture it's top line product. I'm using my motorola nexus 6 for 2.5 years and still not a single problem im facing and decided to keep it for 1 more year. Omar Al Matar Had the problem, I was out of warranty, called them, no frustration or arguments, 5 minutes i had the email to get my new phone, and i sent them the one i had, i was even out of the country. Now I got it to last me another year, so idk about y'all Kristen Oliver This happened with me until I replaced the battery... At my own cost. Funnily enough that is not a software issue 12321 Please click the links below for details of my experience, which is echoed by thousands of other Nexus 6P owners.

Sue them! Merxury My Nexus 6p died, it stuck at bootloop every time when I turn on my phone. Sara Bales I've had the Huawei Nexus 6P since July of 2016, purchased new in the box. It started randomly shutting down within weeks, often multiple times a day. It was annoying and inconvenient, even shutting down once when I was on a 911 call reporting an intruder in the garage (talk about chaos. . . I had to wait for it to reboot and call again). My phone entered the "boot loop of death" the last week of March. The first 6 or so crashes, it rebooted just fine. But then it started getting hung up on the rainbow google animations, until finally it wouldn't even push past the Google screen. I was able to pull up the barcodes but other system reboots were useless. Since my phone is still under warranty, Huawei agreed to repair it but I had to wait 5 days for a label from UPS. It's been almost 3 weeks and I've heard nothing. They also didn't offer to send a loaner phone. At least mine was under warranty, I see on the forum that Google and Huawei have refused to help and neither want to accept responsibility. Ron Nguyen My 6p shutdown prematurely everyday but at different battery percentages. Mostly around 30%, but I have had 40, 50s and 60. Anunnaki A battery replacement fixes the early shutdown problem. Sriidhar sriidhar My 6p died couple of weeks ago and Google and Huawei must be sued for not taking the responsibility, I'm a student and I saved a lot of money to buy the phone but now they're like, it's not our concern as you're out of warranty! Konstigt2 Very good, they should have issued a recall and fixed them all. To not have your phone avail when you need it in case of emergency could be fatal. I have gotten my battery and screen replaced and that fixed it for me. arpit saxena My 6p shutdown few months back, after bootloop and hasn't been turned on since them. Both companies failed to address the situation and to fix the fault Huawei asks for 400$. I don't seem to find any kind of Justice in this area. David Berry All you poor nexus folks hot rolled. High price.shite processor thats had issues in every phone its been put in & sealed in battery copping quick charge for 12months through then the new usbc port then add that to the Chinese manufacturer &issues that causes with returns & you have a massive recipie for disaster. So is your nexus 6p still beter than an s7e or note5or7?Maybe the little fire issue puts it on a par with note 7 just but with that 810 inside it was always doomed from the start. No wonder they canned it for the now overpriced pixel. I think id rather a umi z plus for under half the price. So wheres the samsung haters now? I hate them too but they do make the best phones once you tweak this & that & set it up right. My note5 died after 18 months too. It did cop a real hammering as a wifi hotspot for a while there though. It used to get real hot with a few people connected at once & my bro never let it rest & would run it hot & flat every day. Sometimes 2x a day so it was to be expected. I got 2 note 7s for Sweet f%$ck all & a free s7e from samsung so ill forgive them a little & send back my note5 in the fire proof box & keep the other note 7 as a spare & as compensation for losing all my music &stuff on the note5& the fiasco of the n7recall. Sealed in batteries suck unless you replace your phone every 18months. Boy Ling Mine shuts down at 33% maybe 8 Times out of 10. I never updated to android 7. Mandeep Singh Pannu Mine normally dies off at 30%, then I connected it to charge, it comes back on at 30%.... Also I live up north in the UK, and at early in the morning, if I go out, and it's too cold it just dies randomly theadamsegal Very disappointed with Google. My Nexus 6P started shutting off at around 20% less than a year after I purchased it. The basically pulled an Apple with the release of the Pixel. After purchasing 3 Nexus phones in 4 years, I won't be buying a Google handset again. Ashwini Kumar Same issue here. Phone dies suddenly at 10-15% without any warnings. I love the phone but battery is pathetic. I barely get 10 hours on light usage. I hate apple but the 6s plus from work would be at 50% battery at the end of the day. First google deserted the nexus brand and then not honouring the issue. Disappointed! Sean Stone I'm currently replying from my just received RMA replacement for the boot loop issue. My warranty was technically up in November but the Google Tech Support hooked me up anyway. Better outcome than I was expecting. Thomas Boel Mine shut's down at round about 20%, but only when the screen is turned on! The warning comes and immediately it starts shutting down. Maggie Smith I don't get any warning. It just reboots at random. I wish I did get a warning. David Schleifstein Shuts down at 15% for me, closer to 30% for my wife's. I also noticed that a short time in colder temperatures can cause the battery to drop dead at 50% and up. Ger PG How is this affecting users? David McFee Same issue. Daily premature shutdown. So annoying. Jon Watts Get a grip people. It's just a phone. If it doesn't work just get a new one. I've had the 6P since its release in 2015. Yes I've had a few issues but nothing that didn't eventually get fixed. Dirge Yeah, all those thousands of people that suffer from this problem better just get a grip. So Google sold a defective product, so what? Go buy another one. Duh. "I'm not having any problems therefore these people need to get their shit together." *Rolls eye's* Drew Harden https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/fff14c9ec4b9b4966ae37554f13b373d9bfa270aa644c3e5ef01a5fca3723410.png Mine usually shuts down when the phone is pretty cold and then I turn the screen on and then it just dies. In the warmer weather it still dies with 15% every time though. If I start a Snapchat video below 20% it's instantly off. Dan Molina I haven't had a shut down at 60% but I get it at 25% pretty consistently. Bootloop is rare too; however, I do get random restarts usually while on a phone call. Danny Mestriner Good, maybe they will finally get off their lazy asses and treat us like actual customers. I also have the shutdown issue since Nougat. Philip Quach I've had the same issue even after factory reset. It's especially bad when the temperature outside is cold. I'm really disappointed with Huawei and Google about this. Artūras Rimonis Having the same issue. It always shuts down at 15% or even more. Cara Buttitta sometimes mine dies at 20% sometimes at 60%. just today my 6p was at 90%, I took one picture without the flash and it shut down. very frustrating David Perez Yes, it's been an issue since nougat, from what I recall. Both Nexus 6p devices I have suffered from increased battery drain, and sudden shutdown anywhere from 15 to 25%. Google points to Huawei, Huawei points to Google. I downgraded one device back to marshmallow. Battery drain is still pronounced, but at least no shutdown. I get my warning at 15% and can run until the single digits. John Adams Will die between 20-35% every time, also randomly restarts at around 50%. This phone has been plagued with bugs since release... Jordan Hindley https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/0aef98131463828edbc4ecec53b90938738636b0a4ab26649126e2b51247d48d.png My device shuts down at lots of different battery percentages and won't reboot until i attach to a power source. It's a nightmare. MeanBeans I get that all the time as well even after I changed the battery Mike I Easy. Have Google make their own phones. Call them, oh, Pixel? I'm writing this on my lg5x with 7.1.2. Very happy with it, but will take 200 off coupon on the LG g6 against any and all future 5x claims. Seiga Is it safe to say I should utilize my Nexus protect? I too am suffering from this issue. CJ Nexus 6p start shutting down with 1 to 2 times a day, which increase to more than 10 times within 3 month..huwaei and Google blaming each other for issues..phone is under warranty, but can't do anything.. Miresnare Love my 6p. Never had an issue with it apart from the slo-mo on the camera. Wonderful device. Rob Paek My 6P shut off abruptly right after it gave me the 15% warning the other day. Other than that it has been freezing lately and forcing me to reboot. lance colton Suing is great and all, but every AMERICAN class action lawsuit does absolutely nothing for those of us that aren't in the USA. All the times Nvidia and Sony got sued for stuff they sold me that didn't work as advertised, I'm entitled to NOTHING. This phone is such garbage. Just got it back from the bootloop repair, and the battery starts dying at 20% left. Then 40%. Yesterday, 60%. WTF. I don't think it's Google's fault, though. They would have fixed the software if they can by now. More like Huawei built this thing out of garbage, so it actually needs to be replaced after a year. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/776a4957bbcf9a86578fe290eba3107f160fabf3d0d520adb81993f61d67cca0.png You wouldn't believe the trouble I had getting this thing in for repairs either. I bought it from my carrier so I can't deal with Google or Huawei. They do troubleshooting but for warranty I have to deal with 'Freedom mobile'. I have to go into a certain shopping mall and go to a specific kiosk that is a designated repair center. They refused to honor the terms of the warranty, specifically that the original bootloop repair gives me 90 days more warranty. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/735c6d189c2684ae884f4c97c0d443766058dfa8c7119577c26c17b6da30b031.png Even the Huawei website says it's under warranty for a few more days. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/63182bf80270d912f90486d64178eff22d06e6ef98c0bbc1b1c6fcad3b6f4c62.png I had to give up at the kiosk, go to my car, and phone 611. Talked to an idiot that wastes my time with irrelevant troubleshooting, then she tries to tell me the warranty is expired too. Ask for a supervisor. Same story, but she speaks better English. I argue with her that they need to honor the terms on their website, but she says I'm not understanding them. I refuse to give up, she finally places me on hold for 5 min, comes back, admits I'm correct. I still have 3 days warranty according to her now. She puts a note on the account, then I go back to the kiosk, tell the guy there to read the note and finally he calls his manager, and figures out how to process the claim. If they didn't glue the stupid thing together, I'd replace the battery myself. They choose to make it un-repairable, they can fix it. Jeremy Miethker that means its going to bootloop soon. that is what happened to me Cindy Up until the April 2017 update, I was experiencing this same issue. My Nexus 6P would die with as much as 23% battery life left. oscar acevedo Oh that explains why my phone unexpectedly shuts down from time to time. Nexus 6P v7.1.2 blenderboy People still buy google devices like Pixel. Consumers vote with their money. The moment you buy a device you are promoting the brand. I don't think there will be any outcome for this lawsuit. This is just a publicity stunt. Samsung hardware is great, software is shit. Google software is ok but hardware partners do not work properly with Google(initial supply, firmware updates, warranty replacements). I am waiting for Pixel(maybe in 2 yrs) after seeing how current Pixel owners are treated by Google. Apple hardware is great, software works as expected. I use Linux at home and without itunes it is difficult to use a iPhone. So only option for me is Android. Charles Jordan I have the Nexus 6P a lotnd I have no issues and it's all updated. ThEGr33k Sent mi e of for RMA in the UK they did a "software update" to android 7 and sent it back. Safe to say the early shutdown and terrible battery life is still here... Have sent an email asking for the battery to be replaced so see what i hear back... Felipe I had my 6P fallen into the bootloop problem, I was given a replacement as Huawei honored its 15 months warranty (even though the documentation everywhere says it has 12 months factory warranty, it in fact has 15 months, with Huawei, but NOT with Google, shame Google!). Now, I'm about to get this replacement unit and pray, really pray hard that nothing new appears with this phone. Even tough there are now reports of replaced phones crashing again into the bootloop bug and, recently that Android 7.1.2 final, screwed the fingerprint sensor. Many are not liking the way Google+Huawei (yes, both) is handling this crisis, which in fact is a major one. I think customers who spent lots of hard earned money should get a quality device which keeps on working well, even after its warranty period expired and, wheren there is a well known massive problem, the manufacturer(s) Hardware+Software should honor fixes or reimburses, despite the fact that there are now the Pixels phones. If my replacement phone fails, I'd be more than willing to participate in a class action suit. Jeremy Miethker my brothers replacement phone already went into bootloop 5 days after receiving it. my phone died last week. Jacob Kraniak I thought I was going crazy when I noticed my 6P constantly rebooting on it's own. At least now I know I'm not alone with htis issue. Hopefully they give us something back in return. Maybe a replacement? Hell, I'd rather just return it at this point and use whatever credit they give me towards a Pixel or OP3T. that's not to say I haven't loved the 6P of course. Alexander Dumo Ive had this issue since updating my 6P sometime this past December. We shouldn't have to live with charging our phone before it hits approx 15%-20% battery life. When that warning pops up, the phone just shuts down. Make no sense...please fix this Huawei/Google! Charles Constantine I reported shutdowns at battery levels of 20-60 percentage remaining and was given a list of things to do including a "factory reset" and then told to report back by Google Project fi support. ARDankar I am glad I did not upgrade to nougat yet. Keep me posted on any news regarding issues with the Nexus 6P. David Droddy The Goog replaced my 6P very quickly when I demonstrated the sudden shut down problem even in safe mode and after full factory reset. Why would you report that Google is not responsive to this issue? Seanmiz Yep, I've experienced both issues on my 6P. I got hit with the bootloop of death a few months ago, luckily still under warranty with Huawei and got a replacement. I get the early battery shutdown usually in the 10-20% range. prwnd https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/cd48abb593ae6c1dd226cbe06ba45cf7195abd40318303b2290ca9229846939e.png Biojoe Me too. Travis Coble Oddly enough, sometimes it shuts down early, and sometimes it's fine. However, given my use of it and constant recharging, I'm convinced that this will end up going nowhere because the problem is actually pretty normal for devices that are going on two years of age due to the use of LIon batteries. People claiming shutdown at 60%? I'd need to see it to believe it... maverick7526 https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/3b98bc27cfb84fed5d59d503e403949c6d1cd50a18f37dd23dc58235aba80ad6.png It happens. It happened to me in Feb. It was very cold out and the phone just shut off, and would not turn on again until it was plugged into a charger. Brett Crowley Mine just hit a random boot loop and recovery mode is not working. Jeremy Miethker once it bootloops there is nothing you can do. it is now a cool paper weight Hussain Ahmadi I really hope they sue google for this. 6P keeps restarting without any reason, not to forget the excessive freezing issues. Google is getting very arrogant and need some spanking Hussain Ahmadi And of course this will be the last phone I've ever buy from google. Waiting eagerly for Note 8 mercado79 Yes, both issues. The battery issue was covered under warranty directly by Google. The bootloop issue occurred 1 month out of warranty and both companies told me there​ was nothing they could do for me. Marcin Nowak I had this issue since beginning of the year and Google forums just said wait for update. Finally contacted Google about it just last week feed up asking for help and they told me to F.off pretty much. zefred Got it. It started RIGHT after the one year mark. Contacted google AND Huawei, and was turned down by both. My N6p doesn't even last half a day with recharging. I need to carry extra external batteries everywhere with me, as well as a charge and cable, and the device is barely a year and a half old. NOT a happy camper :( 12321 Law360, Dallas (April 17, 2017, 5:29 PM EDT) -- Google Inc. and Huawei Technologies USA Inc. were hit with a putative class action in Texas federal court Friday over an allegedly defective smartphone, the Nexus 6P, which the user claims suffers from premature battery drainage. Plaintiff Alex Gorbatchev wants to represent a class of consumers who bought the Google Nexus 6P phones, which he says also suffer from a problem that sends the phone into a “death spiral” in which the phones suddenly switch off and then restart in what is referred to as an... https://www.law360.com/texas/articles/913933/class-hits-google-with-suit-over-defective-nexus-phones https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Bad-Cellphones.pdf Claude L Now it's getting worst with android 7.1.2. I was also experiencing early shutdown with my 6p when using 7.1.1. But now I'm unable to use my phone on a daily basis without having a early shutdown. Today again battery was at 20% and last week it happened at 37%. I was so happy when I bought my phone a year and a half ago because I was able to use it for the whole day without having to charge the battery... Now I have to carry a charger with me... It sucks theadb Anything we can do in Canada? Mine just shuts off randomly all the time. This is was a RMA from an older 6P that had massive battery issues. The guy I just spoke to said my original warranty was up in January this year and there was nothing he could do. This phone shuts down randomly all the time now. I've missed by alarm to wake up twice now because it just shuts off. Only way to power it back on is to go into bootloader and restart. adi sararu mine had his 20% dying today first time... and after reading above... my time to never touch google phones again :D Steve I had same battery problem with my 6p, rather than taking out a lawsuit against Google I just purchased a new battery and replaced it. Phone no longer has the issue, lawsuit closed Kyle Snider Phone shuts off early on me allllllll the time, does this lawsuit affect us in Canada? Adam Macias I'm suffering the premature battery death. I have yet to cross the boot loop issue though. God help me if I do. Jeremy Miethker well im a not so proud owner of a $800 dollar paper weight. i cant believe how this is being handled they want me to spend $550 to replace it than they will reimburse me. are you kidding me. however was wondering if this would happen again if i did get a new one? Jacob Lunsford My 6P shuts down with anywhere from 10-30% battery remaining. pi app my problem is the uber driver app stopped working on this phone about 2 weeks ago (same app was working fine on this phone for last 8 months). when i log into uber driver app on any other fine it works fine. a chinese person told me because huawei is a chinese company and they hate uber they may have done something to prevent the app from working on their phones. i was going to buy another nexus 6p to see if same problem occurs. then i will know. my battery's been fine with my phone. Svart Adam Solander My phone shutdown at around 20-25%. Quite annoying. sleepytinksy Also have this issue - phone shut down right before the gates opened for a soccer match and they only issued digital tickets, scan-able on the phone. As you can imagine, that was less than ideal. Panda without dark circle My 6p shut down at 35% or below when I travel to Japan on winter, I thought it was because of the cold. But when I back to Malaysia, it shut down at 60% or below, not every time but this scared me. :( And yes, it doesn't warning me at all, shut down without any sign. Ahmad Zaib I am from India and facing the same issue on my Nexus 6P. The Huawei customer care response has been that they are coming up with an official response soon. This has been the status since more than 3 weeks now. Anyone here, who knows what can we expect here or how do we proceed? Tom Z 71% (seventy-one percent) Shutdown! Mine just hit a new low (or high) with this issue. I just had mine shut down at 71% (seventy-one percent) remaining battery life. This is a very big problem. I was taking pictures when the phone just went into shut down. I couldn't get it to stay running until I connected power. This needs to be fixed! I'm on the latest version with April 2017 security updates. Tom boses Same issue here. I'm reaching the shutdown at about about 38% mark! I'm frustrated at Google's inaction! Jay Miller Mine has died anywhere from 43% to 15%. It is random battery percentage for the shutdown, but it always claims it is at 15% then shuts down. The minute you plug it in and turn it on, the battery percentage is what it really shut off at, and it is usually in the high 20's. So yesterday I tried something. I went to the factory images I had for my Nexus, and through ADB, I sent it "back in time" to Android 6.0 (original release firmware). I then put it to the test. I turned on the hotspot and started playing games that I know drain the battery. I got the warning at 15%....no shutdown. I continued further. I got a warning at 14%, at 12%, 10%, 5% and eventually it shutdown at 1%. I placed it on the charger and fired it up and it was "truly" at 1% battery. I haven't seen it fully drain in months. While the claim that new batteries work, it also appears that Google has work to do on their end as well. Reversing the firmware did work for me. However, the device wanted to update immediately. I accepted the security patch, but at this point in time I will refuse to upgrade back to Nougat if I can gain the full use of my phone without it shutting off prematurely. Here is my log: Firmware I was on 05/03/2017 at 11 AM Eastern US time: N2G47H (April 2017 Security Patch) Firmware I reversed it to on 05/03/2017 at 12 PM Eastern US time: MDA89D (September 2015) Firmware after accepting most recent security patch OTA on 05/03/2017 at 6:45 PM Eastern US time: MTC19T (Android 6.0.1 but security is May 2016) Mister Sonny I'm having the early shutdown issue, for me it's consistently at around 25% battery life. This is made worse by the fact that I have an accessory almost always connected (Fitbit Blaze) NumbGrip I've been having this problem since about 6 weeks ago and it started completly out of nowhere Vince Romeo I've encountered the boot loop problem on 6p after <18 mo. Occasionally sudden shutdowns before that happened. My wife's phone is ~19+ and has sudden shutdown issues.

Thrun was hired by Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin after creating a driverless car in 2005. Arjun Kharpal | @ArjunKharpal Thursday, 11 May 2017 | 2:14 AM ETCNBC.com SHARES show chapters The Brave Ones: A window into Sebastian Thrun's creative world    Wednesday, 10 May 2017 | 6:36 AM ET | 01:01 In 2005, Sebastian Thrun was busy building a driverless car at Stanford to prepare for a race that would eventually lead to him being hired by Google to head up their most ambitious "moonshot" projects. And it began with Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin turning up to the race in a disguise. Thrun had built a self-driving car to compete in the DARPA Grand Challenge – a 132 mile off-road course through mountain roads in California. The Stanford Racing Team with their vehicle named Stanley came first. "My team turned out to be the lucky winner for whatever reason," Thrun told CNBC in an interview for the new series "The Brave Ones". "And we got the attention of the Google founders. Yeah. So Larry came to the race itself and … came disguised with, like, a hat and sunglasses so he wouldn't be bothered by everybody. But … he had a keen interest in this. Larry has been a believer in this technology for much longer than I even knew. And so was Sergey. And they really want to understand what's going on." Kim Kulish | Corbis | Getty Images Sebastian Thrun in 2005 in front of the autonomous car he helped develop. In 2007, Thrun then built the next version of his driverless cars which had cameras on them, allowing it to record 360 degrees of video. This sparked off the start of a well-known feature on Google Maps known as Street View. "And we went to Google and said we'd love to help you build Street View. And we kind of ended up … felt like an acquisition of a little start-up company, kind of Stanford transitioning into Google where me and four of my grad students then became Street View enthusiasts. And we built up Street View and with a singular vision to photograph every street in the world," Thrun said. Three years later in 2010, Google X – the tech giant's lab that created its Waymo self-driving car program and the augmented reality Google Glass device – was set up by Thrun, Yoky Matsuoka, and Astro Teller. The aim of the lab was to develop "moonshots" – inventions that could be big in the future. Waymo was spun out of Google X in September and is now Google's driverless car division. At the U.S. search giant, Google X was a big secret. "We started Google X – with the self-driving car project. And the idea was to really kind of build an innovation center that has authority to just do crazy things," Thrun told CNBC. "We had a separate building that no one knew about. At least for a year and a half no one in Google had a clue we existed." 'Just do it' Thrun wasn't even convinced that the self-driving car project he began at Google would be safe in public. Page then challenged Thrun to make it work and drew up a 1,000 mile route in California that was very tricky to drive. "Look, it can be done. People can do it. Just do it.," Page told Thrun, according to the Google X co-founder. "And to my complete surprise, blows my mind, about 15 months a later a team of 12 engineers did it." Waymo's autonomous vehicles have now driven 2.5 million miles and the company is looking to partner with established automakers. Follow CNBC International on Twitter and Facebook.

Cherrayil, Staff Reporter   SMALL MEDIUM LARGE Dubai Competition in the high-end smartphone virtual reality market is heating up in 2017 with Google’s Daydream platform emerging to offer an alternative to the established market leader, Samsung’s Gear VR. According to the latest forecasts from business information provider IHS Markit, Daydream View headset sales are forecast to jump from 120,000 in 2016 to 2.23 million in 2017 and will enjoy growing industry support from third-party smartphone vendors in the second half of 2017. While this growth is impressive, Samsung’s Gear VR will remain the market leader in the high-end smartphone VR sector in 2017 with sales of 4.1 million. Samsung ended 2016 as the VR platform market leader due to its early mover advantage, high-quality VR experience and aggressive go-to-market strategy for Gear VR. However, the competitive landscape for VR headsets is unsettled and fast moving where newly released products from major competitors can quickly alter the balance of the market, IHS Markit says. Google Daydream’s impact on the market will take time to materialise as smartphone vendors get to grips with the high-end requirements for Daydream accredited phones, especially supply-chain pinch points such as OLED displays. In 2016, Samsung used its Gear VR headset as a powerful marketing tool to promote sales of its Galaxy S7 smartphone and implemented appropriate pre-order bundling strategies across many sales territories. In 2017, Samsung has taken a more targeted approach retaining the offer for the launch of the Galaxy S8 in USA and Australia, but dropping it in a number of European territories. “The arrival of competing platforms is playing out against a backdrop where Samsung has dialled down its previously aggressive pre-order bundling centred on its flagship smartphones and the Gear VR,” Harding-Rolls said. With this change in strategy — partly driven by the Galaxy S8’s already clearly differentiated feature set — and the higher price point of the new Gear VR including motion controller, IHS Markit expects unit sales of Gear VR to decline year-on-year, although it will remain the biggest premium platform for VR content across the major brands. IHS Markit forecasts that consumer sales of Samsung’s Gear VR will decline by 9.6 per cent by year’s end, from 4.56 million in 2016 to 4.12 million.

It is now just the Google Play logo with no other ornamentation. It's worth noting that the round icon variant hasn't changed, so it still looks like the Google Play logo on a dinner plate. Above: Old version. Below: New version. The notification icons have also gone through a little facelift. These also trade away the tote bag motif for the Google Play triangle, but slightly adjusted with the checkmark extending beyond the lines. The notification icons come in different colors for each of the content stores (e.g. apps, books, movies). The notification icon for stacked updates – when more than one app is installed or updated – is no longer a stack of blocks, it's just the same triangle app icon used with single installs. We're still looking for more changes in this update, but it's starting to look like this may be it.

Tom Westrick If they wait long enough it'll just be back to that logo C64 Thank god / satan (choose your preference) for icon packs Konrad Krawczuk Icon packs are always kinda problem to me.

C64 Sorry forgot the Atheist Jose Romero Google IO can't come sooner. Devin Studios Looks kinda boring compared to the old icon. Breathless So wait what happened to circles?... Cody Toombs Circles are there on the Pixel and in any other situation where the round icons are chosen. The triangle icon shows up on everything else. Anton Kuznetsov Triangles is the new circles burkett375 Since they love to A/B test, make 7 different message apps, etc....they should make 3 competing app stores/markets/hubs Ben Godfrey Don't give them any "good" ideas ;) Marcelove It doesn't matter...

But it must be chimpanzees, because even with the clear feedback about stupid decisions they got here, they still don't give a f*ck and keep the screw route. Sumeet Deshmukh People who paid a lot of money to Google aren't getting these icon updates, the pixel guys mattcoz Because our icons already dropped the shopping bag, no need for an update. Sumeet Deshmukh I was a little sarcastical, I love my pixel (styled rom on my Nexus 5 (not x) Victor Stuber ya, but we got crappy white circles around all our icons. It sucks Leon I like my circles personally. sklatigre Gonna miss the shopping bag notification, kinda liked it. global etest You can keep it easily by icon packs.. sklatigre Didn't know icon packs can change the notification icons also. Margaritas Ante Porcos Google is a mess in everything. Mr. DICKHEAD it was always a mess.. Berkay Anyone else dislike both the circled icon and just the icon by itself? I prefer the shopping bag... It looks the best IMO. Thomas I loved the Android Market icon. Made so much sense SavageJeep What is Android Market? /s Salis Before Google Play branding, the app store used to he simply called Android Market. NooSH it looks like crap and i'm glad they are getting rid of it. Berkay So you prefer a simple triangle over a shopping bag? It looks horrible lol. TheDrunkenClam Completely agree. Google's whole ad campaign about Android was "be together, not the same". And then they make literally all of their icons the same by putting them in boring white circles. All in an effort to copy apple. I love the different sized and shaped icons of Android. Not a good look, Google. Jesse Kawell Once you see that notification icon "checkmark" ✅ as a 3D post lying down at an angle, you can never unsee it. BoFiS Aww, that's sad, and almost unrecognizable now since I still call mine "Market" on my homescreen... Branko Proof that Google lost the plot. reCoded So, the circle icon is the same I guess?

I think that "Обновить все" is enough. Konrad Krawczuk Why it is not something like "обновить все" ? YuCMi Jesus christ Google. What sin did the previous icon commit? Was it too old for you guys? Grey Very ugly and hard to understand. Not intuitive at all. But I guess that's Google 2017! Lawstorant Looks generic af. Really Google? WTF? Maybe just go back to HOLO then? DragoCubed The new icon is nice but the icon in the notification bar isn't so nice. The one thing I don't like about losing the bag is the icon not representing a store. xyz OMG! TRIANGLE! NO CIRCLE? Like if you don't give a flying F about icon shapes. LOL I want circle, niggа! LOL New icon! Fuсk YEAH! Paul Teale Not circular then, not really following their own guidelines are they Kieron Quinn The round icon is round, the non-round icon is not. They're following their guidelines just fine Erimaru What about round icon? Curt I actually like this icon the most. Martin Spierings I already got complaints from people that didn't identify the play store or play icon with app store. So how the hell would this help people? They should realize that most people don't understand the connection google is looking for. Play is used for movies/film or games, not apps. The bag-background at least gave some indication on what to expect. The new one will get lots of people (those not really experienced with Android or mobile in general) to get their apps from there. These things should be self explanatory. And Google should drop the Play name (plus icon). Its a stupid name already. avnow well I used to get this icon pack, not exactly but close to this with an icon pack, this icon looks crisp! //moumon Meh.. I'm still using Elta icon pack :v That's one of the reason why I love android... Customize to meet your expectations <3 jcopernicus Awesome. A play button for purchases! Makes sense!

[Minority Report] Google and Coca-Cola may target personalized ads at you - in real life Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/05/10 11:27am PDTMay 10, 2017 23 Plus 1 on G+ 45 Share on Facebook 49 Share on Twitter Total Shares117 News Videos Google and Coca-Cola's partnership effort for in-store advertising displays looks to be bearing fruit. The advertising system uses DoubleClick's preference and tracking data combined with Google's Beacon Platform to serve up targeted ads by pulling data from passing smartphones. With that info, displays are able to select content based on your preferences in the form of advertisements specifically targeted to passersby. In a recent grocery store pilot program the Minority Report-style ads performed quite very well. This isn't actually that new. It was discussed at a few places in the last couple months since the details were revealed at Google's conference. But, it seems to have quite effectively flown under the radar for that time, considering how cool it is. Coca-Cola made a detailed post about it on one of their social promotion sites in April as well, in which they talked about the potential environments for these tracking signage systems, like movie theaters and other Retail venues than just grocery stores. Google's partnership with Coca-Cola for this system has been discussed off-and-on for a few years. Back at the National Automatic Merchandising Association's OneShow in 2016 Google talked about the potential as applied to vending machines, and said that Google and Coca-Cola were working together on Bluetooth beacons for vending, but this is the first time I've actually gotten to see what it looks like and how it performs. Coca-Cola's Greg Chambers, at Google's recent Cloud Next Conference, said that it has been experimenting with small tests into proximity marketing since at least 2015 when they first started working with Google on a prototype. The two companies tested things with a pilot for the system in 250 Albertson's grocery stores, in which Coca-Cola saw some incredible results. There was a one year ROI on Coca-Cola products displayed by the system, and a spillover effect from so-called "category-lift," in the form of a total one-month ROI for all nearby soda products — i.e., this system sells a lot of soda for Coca-Cola and all other brands near it. There's no word yet on when or how Coca-Cola might roll this out to other stores, but given how positive the results were for the pilot tests, it is likely you'll see one someday at the end of the soda aisle in your local grocery. On a more technical note, I'm not sure exactly what sort of data is being sent to the displays by nearby phones or how it is taken. Allegedly the system uses Google's Eddystone beacons, which exchange information with nearby phones using Bluetooth low energy. This is the first time I've heard of Google's Beacon Platform actually being used, combined with DoubleClick's targeting advertising systems, to target people in the physical world. The privacy-conscious might express some concern at the potential of having your phone communicate your preferences to an in-store display, but I would hope and assume that any identifying information is stripped out. Either way, we're one step closer to this. Source: Digital Strategy Consulting Tags beacon platform beacons bluetooth low energy Coca-Cola Eddystone Targeted advertisements video subscribe ...

Anu6is Stop being absurd, how else would you know what you NEED? WesleySmalls Actually, you do. People require social interaction, it's a very strong part of our being. Humans generally don't like to be alone, and very much can't over longer periods of time. Because of this, people tend to follow each other's example in one way or another, advertising is just one of the many examples Ben Yeah, your phone communicating with a vending machine to give you personalised advertisements is not in any way 'social interaction'. WesleySmalls I did not say anything about that, it wasn't even remotely close, nor was the post I commented on. But of course, else you had to actually comment on my actual post, and realize that it's true that people follow other people Prezes Dyrektor But you are making it sound like advertising is indispensable in our lives. Well guess what, ads is the reason why I cut cable tv, they don't have those fancy adblockers. Ads is the reason I mostly listen to local academic radio without any. Etc. Ads and marketing are evil, and we are being manipulated every day. Now excuse me as I run to grab some sugar soda and candy. xyz Your second sentence was "People require social interaction". It seems you didn't bother reading your own comment. WesleySmalls Indeed, that was a art of my comment, which was a reply to a comment that wasnt about any digital technologies. Ryne Hager https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKlSVNxLB-A xyz "Humans generally don't like to be alone, and very much can't over longer periods of time." Right, that's why we have these things called friends and family. I mean if ads are your way making the loneliness go away, good for you. WesleySmalls It wasnt really difficult to grasp that advertisement uses these relationships and human behavior to advertise their product Avishek GSkynet: Resistance is Futile https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/eceea630e7e43621ded725c3914bdc7a06d9b153943c3512fb6b0f0eeff75d71.png Bryan Does it just give a different Coke commercial based on my tastes?

I block all ads, turn off all targeted options everywhere, and never click on any. I guess I'll have to turn off Bluetooth when I'm in stores now too. Fadakar lol if you think your record is clean you need to re-evaluate how seriously you want to take privacy. James F This. People underestimate how much of a digital footprint they leave, even if they do turn off everything. EowynCarter True. And if they are, they wouldn't show me ads for coca cola, I just don't like that. And sodas in general. Cakefish Agreed, if I have to endure advertising it might as well be about products that actually interest me. Bewear I am a fan of your picture edits, Ryne.

Guessing the capabilities will be endless and more diverse when full-on set-ups are placed everywhere. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/7ea9fde9939850ddee856f08d34c3e8a98a6c90461c779f049060ec4e655b8c6.png https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/f87dc3afe5a1492c33e179552b9fcf3259d388ef4a1a6cfed7951d9612faeae6.png https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/da689e538e0681368f0ef1dac408a796aa111781564a9ded426c4639fbeab351.jpg F4LL0U7 Disabling Nearby will disable invasive ads, you say? Done! Morten Ulv Google usually have a way to opt out. james fuston https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPGgTy5YJ-g Ben Nothing better than a new way to sell people tooth-rotting, diabetes-causing sugar water. Nicholas Conrad *This* is the gateway to AR! Aing actual R; genius! abqnm Are these connected to the "Nearby" activity in Google Settings? (Which also interestingly enough at some point has earned the ability to add the Nearby activity directly to the homescreen. Don't know when it appeared as I don't open that screen often, but it's now an option in the overflow menu.) James F Beacons typically use Bluetooth. abqnm Yes, and Google's Nearby uses Bluetooth LE scanning and Play Services location. But with Google being a part of it, I'm asking if it is directly related to the Nearby function. I am not asking for how beacons typically work. MJ Double checked BT is off on my phone... The only time ever use it is when play music on a BT speaker which I don't do when grocery shopping. "With that info, displays are able to select content based on your preferences in the form of advertisements specifically targeted to passersby" How does these ads work exactly? I am not watching a 54min video. Dedren You don't need bluetooth on per say. It just uses that tech. I believe you will have to enable Nearby places, which is disabled by default but will probably be enabled by default in the future. MJ Nearby places will not be going on... F4LL0U7 I'm not sure they could develop an ad that's targeted enough to get me to buy Coke. F4LL0U7 I guess I might consider it if the vending machine held a family member hostage or something. James F I don't know if I should be concerned that you said *might* consider it.... F4LL0U7 What can I say, I'm just not very receptive to ads. Dedren What about Water, Sprite, SimplyOrange, Powerade, Minute Maid? Surely one of those you drink...all Coke. F4LL0U7 I mean, of course I drink water, but I get it from the filtered pitcher in my fridge. No to the others. xyz You regularly purchase water from the Coca-Cola company? May I also say, I've never heard of SimplyOrange and Powerade. I had no idea that diabetes and obesity came in so many flavors. Adrian quickest way to turn me off on a product. Bluetooth is only on in my car anyway so good luck with it. As soon as someone figures out how to spoof it and annoy people in public, it will go away. Max Johnson I thought it's been NFC and GPS all this time. At least from my Android Pay app. Adrian I don't leave either on when I'm not using them so it's probably a non-issue for me then. blindexecutioner I would literally break my phone if I got an ad as I walked by a pop machine (or whatever) if I couldn't opt out of it of course.. I would switch to iOS that day. If it happened on iOS I would stop using smart phones altogether. tehboogieman You could just turn off bluetooth. Or you know, there's your way rndusrnm479461 iOS also supports this same thing. rndusrnm479461 I've read the whole article and even watched some of that video and I still don't get it - what do your "preferences" affect in the ads? How will it affect what the ad displays? Does it just play the ad you're more likely to prefer from 5 different ads? I'm confused... Why is such system necessary for something simple like coke? Would make more sense for a bus stop ad or other kinds of billboards. Joey1058 I hate to tell you folks this, but I've been out in the wilderness preaching this for at least a good 10 years, if you go by my 2007 blog post: http://joey1058.blogspot.com/2007/07/robots-dreams-is-vending-machine-robot.html Cakefish ALL GLORY TO THE HYPNOTOAD!!! xyz Damn, you got me. I have no choice now but to buy a Pepsi. psuedonymous "On a more technical note, I'm not sure exactly what sort of data is being sent to the displays by nearby phones or how it is taken." BLE Beacons are transmit-only. In order for a piece of ad signage to get any information from you, the chain works like this: BLE beacon emits location. Phone detects beacon, is informed that it is near location. Software on phone then queries backend platform (Google's Beacon platform in this case) to see if there is anything it needs to do with this new knowledge. This could be displaying a popup message, or in this case the phone itself does nothing. Instead, since Google's service has learnt your phone is near a beacon (geographically it cares not, this is logical nearness rather than necessarily physical nearness) so contacts the beacon owner with "Anonuser is nearby who hits your preset filter for Target users" (e.g. users who like coke, users who are above a certain age, users who have not previously pinged this beacon, etc). 'Anonuser' could be a unique but nonpersonal hash, a semi-persistant hash (e.g. for each ad client only), a time-limited persistant hash (e.g. valid for only a certain period before changing, probably just for the single proximity session), or just no hash at all so the ad client cannot track individual users. There may be an avenue for the ad client to pass a message back to google who can then pass it onto the user, without the ad client knowing who the user is.

Some of these should be done now, and others will help if the unfortunate event happens and your G4 goes missing. One of the worst gut-wrenching feeling in the world is that of losing a smartphone. They are an essential part of most owners lives, not to mention usually hold tons of sensitive data. If your phone is lost or stolen, you’ll want to be prepared for the situation. When it comes to protecting or recovering your smartphone from loss or theft there are a few different options available for Android users. If you happen to lose your LG G4 you’ll want to have Google’s Android Device Manager installed to save the day. Read: How to Find a Lost Smartphone or Tablet Similar to Apple’s Find My iPhone, Google has its own option called the Android Device Manager that all users should know about. It has been available for quite a while, but last year it was finally updated to offer enough features worth talking about. Users can find a lost device inside their own home, or on the other side of the city. Read on for more details on how to find your lost LG G4. We’ve just passed two of the highest months of the year for smartphone theft, which happens to be April and May, and the chances of your new LG G4 getting lost or stolen is still somewhat high all summer long. People are out and about, hanging out at the pool, going shopping, school is out and more. People our outdoors more this time of year. If you value that brand new smartphone, you’ll want to be prepared in case of an incident. You’ll want to be protected year-round because finding a lost or stolen Android device can be a rather tough task, not to mention trying to secure all the important and often times sensitive information that’s on our smartphones these days. Android Device Manager isn’t talked about too often by Google, but it should be. It was updated back in 2013 with tons of features that makes it something everyone should install and setup, received a few new ones earlier this year, and below we’ll go over the benefits and how to do it. Read: 30 LG G4 Tips & Tricks The new Android Device Manager will let users locate their LG G4 and remotely wipe and delete all data and information if needed right from their home PC, laptop or tablet. There’s also a lock feature if you’d rather not wipe all your data, but clearing out your information may be the safest bet. Then Google added an option to make your device ring if you simply can’t find it, which is pretty neat. Instructions If an LG G4 is lost at home or a friends house the Android Device Manager can increase the volume to 100% and ring at full blast to help you find it, or even wipe out all of your user data and lock the screen if you fear it has been lost or stolen. These are essential to protect your information, so lets get started. To activate the LG G4 head to the Google Play Store and download the official Android Device Manager application. Not only will this application explain how the ADM works, let you setup the device it was just installed it on, but can also manage and access other devices right from this app on a mobile device. Meaning you can use this on your LG G Pad 8 to find your G4, or on any Android device to find any other Android smartphone or tablet. The image below is from an HTC One M8, but the same setup is required on the LG G4. Once installed users should open the app and learn about the Android Device Manager, and hit the “Setup Lock & Erase” button down below to get everything setup. It’s all self-explanatory and very easy to do, so don’t hesitate to complete this as soon as you get any new Android device. Users can also get started and all set up by going to www.google.com/android/devicemanager on your computer. This will instantly launch the ADM service which will let you scroll through your list of devices. Here is where you can name the LG G4 to something more personal, find its location, or wipe all data as we mentioned above. Scroll through the list if you have more than one device, and let the ADM do all the work. Find Your Lost LG G4 Using the ADM on another device, or from a PC you’ll navigate to the Android Device Manager page and track the LG G4. In my case above I’m looking for my Google Play Edition Galaxy S4, but you’ll be looking for the G4 (or any Android device for that matter) so simply find it from the dropdown menu. If you renamed it, look for that name. The Android Device Manager uses GPS and Wi-Fi to track the location, often times down to a few feet, and you’re all set. From here the GPS locate button will track the lost or stolen device for you. Google warns users to never try and retrieve a lost device themselves, and to contact the police. We’d have to agree. Bringing an officer of the law with you to try and retrieve a stolen smartphone is probably your best and safest bet. In our screenshot above the location isn’t extremely accurate, showing 24 meters, but that’s because I’m in a gated community and I usually have GPS disabled on my smartphone. For most users this will be deadly accurate, and you’ll find that LG G4 in a matter of seconds. This is also the same place where you can hit the “Ring” button to make some noise and find your lost G4 at home, or even wipe all your data if your fears come true and someone steals it. Read: How to Take a Screenshot on the LG G4 To sum things up all you need is the Android Device Manager installed on the LG G4, then you can use any other Android device or your desktop to find, retrieve, make it ring, wipe, or lock it. Whatever the case may be, Google has you covered. There’s also a new feature where any user that’s logged into their Gmail account can go into a browser like Google Chrome and type “Find My Phone” and it will automatically launch the Android Device Manager and find all devices connected to that account, and enable all the options mentioned and shown above. Hopefully no one needs to use the ADM to find a lost or stolen device, but if so, these steps are some of the best options available. 7 Responses 11/01/2015 verda g Reply It is a flip top phone- Lost How to stop payments on flip top!!!!!!

The new events functionality is available in the US at first, through the Google app for Android and iOS, as well as the Google Search mobile website. You can search for things such as "jazz concerts", "art events", and you'll get a special list filled with at-a-glance details about the upcoming events. You get additional options if you tap More events, and when you find something you like just tap on that and you'll be able to immediately buy tickets for it. It's also possible to look up things coming up on specific dates, using filters such as "today", "tomorrow", or "next week". If you want to go the opposite route and have everything thrown at you, just search for "events near me" and you'll be shown all the different options. As always with new Google features, it's unclear when or if you'll see this outside of the US.

The company is adding a new feature to Search app and mobile web that will show list of all the local events happening near you. For example, when you search for “concerts this weekend” you will see a new Events tab at the top of your search results. Google will also allow you to filter the results by time periods. So you can search for events happening today, tomorrow, next week, next month and so on. If you search for “art events this weekend” Google Search will now show list of events happening around you. You will be able to see the details about each event like its title, date, time, and location. Tapping “more events” will expand the view to see additional dates, and you can tap again for more details or to buy tickets. Moreover, if you are not looking for anything specific, you can simply try typing “events near me” and Google Search will share a list of events what’s happening around the corner. Unfortunately, this feature is currently available only in the U.S as of now and there is no word about a global roll out. Google already shows you list of nearby restaurants, places nearby, cafes, restaurants and more in India. It will be great if it also rolls out the local events feature in the country as we do have several interesting events happening around us almost daily.

After making a first version available to developers at the end of March 2017, Google is gearing up to offer owners of Nexus (latest generations) and Pixel devices a first beta edition of the upcoming version of its Android mobile operating system. Google says that the beta testing phase for Android Nougat has now ended and that a beta version of Android O will be available soon. The Android beta website will be updated soon when the Android O beta program begins. While Android O is expected to be officially unveiled at the Google I/O conference, held at the Shoreline Ampitheatre in Mountain View, California, May 17-19, 2017, many of its new features have already been seen in the version currently being tested by developers. For starters, Google promises to boost device battery life with Android O by restricting the activity of applications running in the background, making them more power-efficient and less battery-draining. A new autofill function will be able to store data such as usernames, passwords, addresses or credit card details and automatically fill out forms. Plus, the update brings "Picture in Picture" (PiP) display capabilities for watching a video while using other apps alongside. Android O overhauls notifications too, allowing developers to create themed notification channels, grouping alerts from various apps so users can decide which ones they receive. In general, users will have greater control over notifications and which ones they want to see displayed onscreen. The number of notifications per app will also be displayed, as in iOS. Another visual change comes in the form of adaptive icons, matching the icon style to a user's particular version of Android, with more rounded or square icon designs in the various manufacturer interfaces. This latest version of Android is expected to land in Google's latest Pixel smartphones before progressively rolling out from fall this year. Google is yet to announce which sweet snack will lend its name to the latest OS. After Android KitKat, Lollipop, Marshmallow and Nougat, could it be time for an Android Oreo?

The Play Store adopts new app and notification icons with v7.8.16 [APK Download] Cody Toombs Follow View All Posts 2017/05/10 6:25pm PDTMay 10, 2017 110 Plus 1 on G+ 272 Share on Facebook 98 Share on Twitter Total Shares480 Applications Downloads News Google never stops changing things up. A new version of the Play Store app is rolling out to users and it comes with a new icons for the app launcher and notifications. They're simple cosmetic adjustments, but these are the types of things you can't help but notice as soon as they're on your screen. Left: Old version. Right: New version. The new app icon leaves behind the last remnants of the shopping bag icon that came along when Google still called this the Android Market. It is now just the Google Play logo with no other ornamentation. It's worth noting that the round icon variant hasn't changed, so it still looks like the Google Play logo on a dinner plate. Above: Old version. Below: New version. The notification icons have also gone through a little facelift. These also trade away the tote bag motif for the Google Play triangle, but slightly adjusted with the checkmark extending beyond the lines. The notification icons come in different colors for each of the content stores (e.g. apps, books, movies). The notification icon for stacked updates – when more than one app is installed or updated – is no longer a stack of blocks, it's just the same triangle app icon used with single installs. We're still looking for more changes in this update, but it's starting to look like this may be it. If you don't want to wait for Google to send this update out to you, grab it from the APK Mirror link below. Download The APK is signed by Google and upgrades your existing app. The cryptographic signature guarantees that the file is safe to install and was not tampered with in any way. Rather than wait for Google to push this download to your devices, which can take days, download and install it just like any other APK.

They 'quickly' portray even to a naive what kind of app you will be clicking on, especially amid numerous numbers of apps. Marcelove .Google' employee : "Let's change an icon the people are used to and know for many years to something that doesn't improve anything." Google's executives : "Genius!” . Powsniffer0110 4.0 FTW Burak Çalık they are not triangles, its the play icon. leganzish What shape is a play icon? I forget. Hachiko Google play books was perfect with Android 5 but only this one... Android 6 version is almost perfect TechGuy22 New icon every year. They are going to change play Store soon too lol Total Insecurity How do you know that? boop Unless you mean the name, the app just got another design update. sbeaulieu Isn't that the same icon from a couple of years ago? Tom Westrick We've always been at war with Eastasia Captain_Invisible Yeah.. they've used that icon on and off in promotion for a while. 4Ui812 Looks like I'll have to wait until it gets pushed. Apkmirrior won't let me download it (I don't turn off my ad blocker for anyone :-) Gjorgi Lazarovski You can download even with the adblocker on. You just need to wait like 10 sec for the download button to show up. sklatigre Can confirm Cakefish And you get to admire a cool cat. Richard Branches The play store icon on google chrome is still the old one, they should update it as well... https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/bca1aca3fd5b60e08fcd507e7c39b67f23f70ed0e4ff417bcf62881906f7106a.png Тарас Мукин Chrome apps were announced to be removed soon. Don't think they are going to bother. Richard Branches You're right about that, but they still will be available on Chrome OS so why not update it anyway?... Curt Because Google. Spazturtle Won't they be replaced in Chrome OS by Android app support? Richard Branches No, they won't... Tom Westrick If they wait long enough it'll just be back to that logo C64 Thank god / satan (choose your preference) for icon packs Konrad Krawczuk Icon packs are always kinda problem to me. If you have a few without icon from icon pack you must always fight with inconsistency. Powsniffer0110 Yes! I'm too freaking anal about this so I cannot use icon pack​s :( xyz Neither. C64 Sorry forgot the Atheist Jose Romero Google IO can't come sooner. Devin Studios Looks kinda boring compared to the old icon. Breathless So wait what happened to circles?... Cody Toombs Circles are there on the Pixel and in any other situation where the round icons are chosen. The triangle icon shows up on everything else. Anton Kuznetsov Triangles is the new circles burkett375 Since they love to A/B test, make 7 different message apps, etc....they should make 3 competing app stores/markets/hubs Ben Godfrey Don't give them any "good" ideas ;) Marcelove It doesn't matter... Google's employees are paid to keep an eye here at AP ... But it must be chimpanzees, because even with the clear feedback about stupid decisions they got here, they still don't give a f*ck and keep the screw route. Sumeet Deshmukh People who paid a lot of money to Google aren't getting these icon updates, the pixel guys mattcoz Because our icons already dropped the shopping bag, no need for an update. Sumeet Deshmukh I was a little sarcastical, I love my pixel (styled rom on my Nexus 5 (not x) Victor Stuber ya, but we got crappy white circles around all our icons. It sucks Leon I like my circles personally. sklatigre Gonna miss the shopping bag notification, kinda liked it. global etest You can keep it easily by icon packs.. sklatigre Didn't know icon packs can change the notification icons also. Margaritas Ante Porcos Google is a mess in everything. Mr. DICKHEAD it was always a mess.. Berkay Anyone else dislike both the circled icon and just the icon by itself? I prefer the shopping bag... It looks the best IMO. Thomas I loved the Android Market icon. Made so much sense SavageJeep What is Android Market? /s Salis Before Google Play branding, the app store used to he simply called Android Market. NooSH it looks like crap and i'm glad they are getting rid of it. Berkay So you prefer a simple triangle over a shopping bag? It looks horrible lol. TheDrunkenClam Completely agree. Google's whole ad campaign about Android was "be together, not the same". And then they make literally all of their icons the same by putting them in boring white circles. All in an effort to copy apple. I love the different sized and shaped icons of Android. Not a good look, Google. Jesse Kawell Once you see that notification icon "checkmark" ✅ as a 3D post lying down at an angle, you can never unsee it. BoFiS Aww, that's sad, and almost unrecognizable now since I still call mine "Market" on my homescreen... Branko Proof that Google lost the plot. reCoded So, the circle icon is the same I guess? Martin Let me read the article for you: "It's worth noting that the round icon variant hasn't changed, so it still looks like the Google Play logo on a dinner plate." Anton Kuznetsov This localization of 'update all' button text is awful https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/57e6791db8965bf1e13f4f50e3b6b5b303644e9c3f1660799bf9896ed1ef57b3.png Exalm ОМГ. Это именно в новой версии вот так? Captain_Invisible That's your crazy language's fault. Vitias R. No it's not. Have a nice day. thunderqus Only if I can find what you are talking about in English and posting screen in "who knows which" language. Vitias R. It says "Update your apps right today". I think that "Обновить все" is enough. Konrad Krawczuk Why it is not something like "обновить все" ? YuCMi Jesus christ Google. What sin did the previous icon commit? Was it too old for you guys? Grey Very ugly and hard to understand. Not intuitive at all. But I guess that's Google 2017! Lawstorant Looks generic af. Really Google? WTF? Maybe just go back to HOLO then? DragoCubed The new icon is nice but the icon in the notification bar isn't so nice. The one thing I don't like about losing the bag is the icon not representing a store. xyz OMG! TRIANGLE! NO CIRCLE? Like if you don't give a flying F about icon shapes. LOL I want circle, niggа! LOL New icon! Fuсk YEAH! Paul Teale Not circular then, not really following their own guidelines are they Kieron Quinn The round icon is round, the non-round icon is not. They're following their guidelines just fine Erimaru What about round icon? Curt I actually like this icon the most. Martin Spierings I already got complaints from people that didn't identify the play store or play icon with app store. So how the hell would this help people? They should realize that most people don't understand the connection google is looking for. Play is used for movies/film or games, not apps. The bag-background at least gave some indication on what to expect. The new one will get lots of people (those not really experienced with Android or mobile in general) to get their apps from there. These things should be self explanatory. And Google should drop the Play name (plus icon). Its a stupid name already. avnow well I used to get this icon pack, not exactly but close to this with an icon pack, this icon looks crisp! //moumon Meh.. I'm still using Elta icon pack :v That's one of the reason why I love android... Customize to meet your expectations <3 jcopernicus Awesome. A play button for purchases! Makes sense! Ra1nb0wD4sh DE Press Start to shut down Windows. :D (Not relevant anymore, I know) Ruben Tavano On the lateral menu the apps section was in the old green and with this update it has been updated to match the new green of the whole play store Alexander Reddicks The icon has been updated to support the new "adaptive" icon style being showcased next week. https://developer.android.com/preview/features/adaptive-icons.html Mr. DICKHEAD This is dumb theres nothing new I like the bodybag version.. but the naked one alone? seriously..?! David Onter The new icon looks HUGE next to the others. It doesn't seem to follow the spacing guidelines? Marcelove Google' employee : "Let's change an icon the people are used to and know for many years to something that doesn't improve anything." Google's executives : "Genius!” Biga173rd They can't make up their minds. madmaglio Finally. I've been replacing the bag icon with my own version of this for years. so much cleaner. VirtualWave I kinda hate it, it looks overly large and gaudy. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/d5821ea6199d4b4d1b5b7fa7fb41a252ab810c809090eb00f133b88f741b1735.png Follow Android Police 1.49M 468k 143k 115k Latest Deals 4 [Deal Alert] Get the LG Urbane 2nd Edition for $171.99 on eBay 2017/05/11 8:04pm PDTMay 11, 2017 4 [Deal Alert] Get 10,000 Amazon Appstore coins for $65 ($35 off) through May 25th 2017/05/11 1:34pm PDTMay 11, 2017 27 T-Mobile to offer 'buy one, get one' deal on Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus starting tomorrow (May 12th) 2017/05/11 12:52pm PDTMay 11, 2017 7 [Deal Alert] Huawei Watch in Jewel/Pearl $220 at Amazon ($330 off) 2017/05/10 7:32pm PDTMay 10, 2017 30 [Update: Deal ended] [Featured Deal Alert] Caseology is offering its new cases for the Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus to Android Police for as little as $5.99 for a limited time [Sponsored] 2017/05/10 2:39pm PDTMay 10, 2017 Latest Poll Do you use a screen protector on your phone?

Arundhuti Dasgupta & Urvi Malvania find out how brands are rethinking digital marketing plans to accommodate this.

Photograph: Shailesh Andrade/Reuters.   Over the next five years, nine out of 10 new users of the Internet from India will be language users says a study by Google and KPMG India (Indian languages: Defining India's Internet). Not only is the number of language users set to grow faster than English users over the next five years, these users are more likely to lead a more active digital life. They take faster to online shopping and are more willing to rely on digital media for entertainment.  The number of customers accessing online retail sites in a language other than English will grow nearly four times while those using digital payment gateways will more than triple the report says.   No brand can thus ignore the growing voice of the native digital consumer on the Internet. Last week, Google began offering its services in nine Indian languages with keyboard support for 11 more. Making the announcement, Rajan Anandan, vice president, India & Southeast Asia, Google had said, "The most important aspect of making the web more useful and meaningful for all of India is to make India's internet more representative of the India we live in."  Currently, there are 234 million language users as compared to 175 million English users on the Internet. In 2011, there were 42 million language and 68 million English users. Not only are the many languages spoken in the country crowding out English users online, their numbers are set to grow even faster. By 2021, language users are expected to grow at 18 per cent CAGR (compound annual growth rate) to 536 million. In the same period, English-language users are likely to grow by a mere three per cent CAGR to reach 199 million. Already a bunch of e-tailers, mobile wallets and entertainment platforms are following a multiple language policy to cater to the diverse needs and challenges of this community. Both Amazon Prime Video and Netflix have focussed on localisation through language subtitles. The latter has also developed software called Hermes to help better and speedier subtitling of its content. Dish TV took localisation a step further with the introduction of its second brand Zing, which focussed on regional customers beyond the metros. So, for each state the brand is present in, the packaging, both physical and for the channel, is skewed towards regional language viewers. For example, in Kerala, the instructions and manual for the set top box are provided in Malayalam instead of only English and Hindi and the base pack for customers of the state, will feature channels in the language of the state, rather than Hindi or English entertainment and news channels. According to the report, digital entertainment is sought out by 167 million language Internet users today and is expected to grow to 392 million users by 2021. India outshines US in internet user base  In the next five years, language users are expected to account for 75 per cent of India's Internet user base. Apart from Hindi, which will account for 38 per cent of the total users on the Internet in five years, Marathi, Bengali, Tamil and Telugu will comprise 30 per cent of the total. E-commerce players like BookMyShow, PayTM have extended the interface language to Hindi and several other languages on the web and mobile. The number of language users accessing digital payments gateways is expected to go up from 28 per cent today to 43 per cent in 2021, thus limiting the potential of an English-only platform to 57 per cent of total Internet users. More than 75 per cent of Indian language Internet users said they preferred using mobile wallets over bank promoted websites and apps.   The study offers interesting insights into the nature of language usage too; 68 per cent Internet users consider local language digital content to be more reliable than English. Ninety-nine per cent of language users access the Internet through their mobile devices while the overall share of people using the mobile for Internet is 78 per cent. For language users, online government services will see the maximum growth in usage, growing at a CAGR of 33 per cent over the next five years. E-tailing, digital classifieds and digital payments are the second fastest category in terms of adoption. E-tailing is currently accessed by 42 million language users. It will grow to 165 million by 2021. The category most shopped online is consumer electronics for such users, not fashion and lifestyle, groceries or home care. The report says that this could be because there is not enough product information and cataloguing in Indian languages by these brands. Almost 44 per cent of language users have said they feel challenged by product descriptions and customer reviews in English. While awareness of e-tailing is high, language and comfort are two big roadblocks to adoption. Over 50 per cent of offline shoppers said they would try e-tailing sites and apps if provided with end-to-end language interface. The majority count exclusivity, product range and convenience as benefits of e-tailing; 90 per cent said they do not see cash backs and discounts as key benefits. Almost 25 per cent of language users said problems at the payments stage led to drop outs. Clearly, to gain their share of the wallet, brands will have to bring down the language barriers online.

TL;DR: There is a popular mantra amongst developers that goes like this write, test and deploy. In this tutorial, I’ll show you how to deploy your PHP apps to different cloud server platforms such as Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, Heroku, IBM Bluemix, and others. Introduction to Cloud Servers Cloud servers are basically virtual servers that run within a cloud computing environment. There are various benefits to hosting and deploying your applications in the cloud. They are: Economically efficient. You have the freedom to modify the server software to your needs. Cloud servers scale very well. Stability and security. In fact, many companies have moved their infrastructure to the cloud in order to reduce cost and complexity. It’s a great option for small, mid-sized, and enterprise scale businesses. If you write a lot of tutorials and do POCs (Proof-of-concepts) like me, it’s also a great choice for you! A generic PHP application involves the common LAMP (Linux, Apache, Mysql and PHP) stack. Linux: The operating system that runs the other software packages. Apache: The web server that runs the PHP code. A popular alternative software is Nginx. MySQL: The database. A popular alternative software is PostgreSQL. PHP: The server-side language for building the application. For a crash course on LAMP / MAMP / WAMP, see this premium resource. Now let’s cover how to deploy PHP applications to several cloud server platforms. Heroku Heroku is a cloud platform that helps you deploy and host your applications the modern way. It does all the heavy-lifting for you. Let’s quickly take a look at how to deploy and maintain a PHP application on heroku. PHP Heroku Architecture If you don’t have an account, go ahead and create one on heroku.com. Then go ahead and install the heroku cli. Once you have that installed, clone this simple starwars PHP application. Heroku runs your PHP app in a dyno, a smart container which provides a modern stack with your choice of web server (Apache or Nginx) and runtime (PHP or HHVM). Make sure you follow these steps below: Create a .env file from .env.example. You need to have an account with Auth0. Go to your Auth0 Dashboard and click the “create a new client” button. Name your new app and select “Regular Web Applications”. In the Settings for your new Auth0 client app, add http://localhost:8000 to the Allowed Callback URLs. Copy out your client id, client secret, domain and callback url. Ensure you assign them to the right variables in your .env file. We have a composer.json file which contains the list of packages that the application needs. Go ahead and run composer install on your local machine to install these packages. Not familiar with Composer? This video might help. Go ahead and run the app. The app should be running like so: Landing page Logged In User Awesome! Our app works locally. Time to deploy! The first thing we’ll do is to add a Procfile to the root directory of our app. Create a new file called Procfile without any file extension and add this: web: vendor/bin/heroku-php-apache2
 A Procfile is a text file in the root directory of your application that defines process types and explicitly declares what command should be executed to start your app on heroku. If you are interested in using Nginx as the web server, then the content of your Procfile would be: web: vendor/bin/heroku-php-nginx
 Now that you have added the Procfile, go ahead and upload the project to GitHub or Bitbucket. Mine is starwazapp. Head over to dashboard.heroku.com/apps and create a new app like so: Create a new app from the dashboard Give it a name like so: Give app a name Choose a deployment method. In our case, we’ll use GitHub like so: Connect to GitHub The reason for choosing GitHub is to make the development and maintenance process very smooth. Developers can work on new features using the git workflow. Now, type the name of the repo in the circled area and click Search. Heroku will search for your repo under your GitHub account and display it like so Search for repo Click on connect like so Click on the connect button Heroku will connect the repo like so Connected Project Scroll down a bit. This is the interesting part. Heroku allows you to enable automatic deploys with the push of a button. It also gives you an option to wait for your continuous integration process to pass before deploying to production. In a real world app, you’ll have a test suite for your codebase. A developers’ code runs against the test suite. If it passes, the code will be pushed to production. Click to enable automatic deploys. We don’t have any CI service, so we don’t need to enable that option. Now, let’s deploy the master branch. Note: You can have other branches and specify which branch you want for production. In our case, the master branch is the production branch. Click on the Deploy branch. Heroku will scan through your composer.lock file, install the necessary packages, and deploy! Deploy finally Click the View button to check out your app. Error 500 Ooops! We are experiencing a 500 error. Aha, we haven’t set any environment variables yet. Locally, we had a .env file. On Heroku, there is no .env file, but there is a way to set environment variables. Go to Settings in your dashboard and add them as config variables like so: Oh, one more thing! The new callback url in my case is http://starwazapp.herokuapp.com. Make sure you add your new callback url to the Allowed Callback URLs in your Auth0 dashboard. Your app should be live & working now! Live App Make a small change Let’s make a small change to our app and see how effortlessly it deploys it to production. Open index.php and change the content of the <p> tag from Heard you don't want to migrate to PHP 7? Dare us! to Star Wars - The Awakening!. Commit and push to your master branch. Now, go to the Activity tab of your Heroku Dashboard and notice the build. Reload your app and you’ll see the difference. Build Succeeded New version Database, Caching & Cron Jobs Let’s quickly talk about how to handle the database, caching, and cron jobs. On Heroku, you can use ClearDB and Postgres with PHP. Add ClearDB to your app like so: heroku addons:create cleardb:ignite
 This command provisions a new ClearDB database and returns the URL that the app will use to access it. All you need to do is add it to your app as an environment variable and parse it in your app’s config like so: ClearDB is a powerful, fault tolerant database-as-a-service in the cloud for your MySQL powered applications. <?php
$url = parse_url(getenv("CLEARDB_DATABASE_URL"));

$server = $url["host"];
$username = $url["user"];
$password = $url["pass"];
$db = substr($url["path"], 1);

$conn = new mysqli($server, $username, $password, $db);
?>
 using mysqli You can tweak that to suit the PDO style. Add Postgres to your app like so: heroku addons:create heroku-postgresql:hobby-dev
 Head over to the addons, and you’ll see other kinds of databases that you can use with your PHP app. Heroku provides an array of addons for caching, from memcache, to fastly , to ironcache, and others. You can check out how to use memcache with PHP on Heroku here. Finally, you can use the Heroku Scheduler for running jobs on your app at scheduled time intervals. Google Cloud The Google Cloud platform is a giant and trusted cloud platform that a lot of companies all over the world have adopted in deploying and hosting their apps. Your apps will be running on the same infrastructure that powers all of Google’s products. What other form of confidence do you need to assure you that your application will scale well enough to serve your thousands and millions of users easily? Google Cloud offers different options for hosting PHP apps. The platform offers App Engine (Fully managed), Compute Engine (Scalable VMs) and Container Engine (Kubernetes Clusters). In our case, we’ll use App Engine. It abstracts the infrastructure away. Let’s jump into deploying our famous Star Wars app to Google App Engine. When using Google App Engine, you can choose the Standard or Flexible environment. The latter, like the name implies, allows you to install any PHP extension that works on Debian Linux, has a configurable Nginx web server, writable filesystem, latest PHP versions and allows you to run deployment scripts using composer.json. We’ll use the flexible environment. Go ahead and create a new project. Click on Create, give the project a name, select the region you’d like to serve your app in, and enable billing. Note: You won’t be charged without your permission. Now, download the Google SDK and install the Google Cloud tools. Installing Google SDK Running gcloud Go ahead and create an app.yaml file in the root of our project like so: app.yaml runtime: php
env: flex
 So, our .env file has been pushed to Google Cloud. An alternative to using that is to add the environment variables to the app.yaml file like so: ...
env_variables:
  # The values here will override those in ".env". This is useful for
  # production-specific configuration. However, feel free to set these
  # values in ".env" instead if you prefer.
  APP_LOG: errorlog
 Now, deploy your application from your console by running gcloud app deploy. Grab the URL, in my case it is https://starwars-166515.appspot.com/, and add to Allowed Origins(CORS) and Allowed Callback URLs in your Auth0 dashboard. Also add the URL to AUTH0_CALLBACK_URL in your .env file. Run gcloud app deploy again to provision a new version of the app. Check out your app now. It should be live like so: Live App Database, Caching & Cron Jobs Google Cloud provides a Cloud SQL Instance platform. Check out how to configure, connect and create MySQL instances for your app here. You can also use phpMyAdmin on Google App Engine. Google App Engine includes implementations of the standard Memcache and Memcached APIs. Check out how to use Memcache in your app on Google Cloud. The App Engine Cron Service allows you to configure regularly scheduled tasks that operate at defined times or regular intervals. Check out how to schedule cron jobs and use task queues with PHP on Google Cloud. It’s relatively easy to deploy Laravel, Symfony and WordPress apps to the Google Cloud Platform. IBM BlueMix IBM Bluemix allows you to easily configure, deploy and scale on a powerful, high performance global cloud infrastructure. Let’s jump into deploying our famous Star Wars app to IBM Bluemix. Sign up on Bluemix like so: Signup on Bluemix Note: The Bluemix platform offers a 30-day free trial so you have a chance to try deploying your own application before handing over your credit card details. Go ahead and create an organization and space. I named my space prod. Now, go ahead and install the Cloud Foundry CLI. Once you have done that, log in from your terminal like so: cf api https://api.ng.bluemix.net/
cf login
 Log in to Bluemix The next step is to create a manifest.yml file in the root directory of the app. The manifest.yml file includes basic information about your app, such as the name, how much memory to allocate for each instance, and the route. Our manifest file should look like this: ---
applications:
  - name: starwarsapp
    memory: 512M
    instances: 1
    host: starwarsapp
 You can also explicitly specify the buildpack in the manifest file. Thankfully, Cloud Foundry automatically detects which buildpack is required when you push an app. Buildpacks provide framework and runtime support for your applications. Buildpacks typically examine user-provided artefacts to determine what dependencies to download and how to configure applications to communicate with bound services. Finally, deploy your app by running the following command like so: cf push <yourapp>
 <yourapp> has to be a unique name. Starting Deploy Ending Deploy Try to run the app now. In my case, the url is starwarsapp.mybluemix.net. Oops, a 500 error. We haven’t loaded our environment variables yet. How do we do that with Bluemix? You can either use the Cloud Foundry CLI or the Bluemix user interface to set environment variables. Let’s use the Bluemix user interface. So, follow the steps below: Open the Bluemix dashboard. Click on the app. You’ll be redirected to another page with more details about the app. Select Runtime from the left panel. Now, click on Environment variables Scroll down and click the Add button to add the environment variables like so Click the Save button. Once you do that, your app will restart automatically. Now grab the URL, in my case it is https://starwarsapp.mybluemix.net/, and add it to Allowed Origins(CORS) and Allowed Callback URLs in your Auth0 dashboard. Now check out your app – it should be live! Database, Caching & Cron Jobs Cloud Foundry provides the ability to create services. IBM Bluemix offers the Cloudant NoSQL database (the Bluemix name for CouchDB). You can use the cf tool to create database services like so: cf create-service cloudantNoSQLDB Lite starwarsapp
 IBM Bluemix also offers the ClearDB MySQL service. So, you can use the cf tool to create one like so: cf create-service cleardb spark starwarsapp
 They offer MongoDB, PostgreSQL, and RethinkDB. You can always use the Cloud Foundry tool to check out a lot of things such as logs, environment variables, etc. like so: cf logs --recent yourapp – Shows the logs of your app. cf env yourapp – Shows the environment variables associated with your app. cf marketplace – Shows all the services that Bluemix has to offer. IBM Bluemix also offers Redis Cloud, a fully-managed cloud service for hosting and running your Redis dataset in BlueMix in a highly-available and scalable manner. IBM Bluemix provides the Workload Scheduler service. This service allows you to integrate your application with the capability to schedule workflows. Far beyond cron, exploit job scheduling within and outside Bluemix. Easily create workflows in your application to run on a regular basis, at a specific time, on events (for example, when a file is deleted or updated), according to your needs. You can either use the Workload Scheduler User Interface or use the APIs. Get started with Scheduling Jobs here. Also, here is how to deploy your Laravel app on IBM Bluemix. Microsoft Azure Microsoft Azure is another massive cloud platform that allows you to scale your apps easily. Let’s get started with deploying our Star Wars app on Azure. With Microsoft Azure, you can deploy via: FTP. Syncing with a cloud folder. Local Git. Cloud based source control service such as GitHub or Bitbucket. In our case, we’ll set up deployment with Git. First, create an account with Microsoft Azure. Dashboard Click on New on the left panel. Click See all just next to Marketplace. Click Web + SQL, then go ahead and create. You’ll be prompted to select an offer for the type of subscription you are comfortable with. I chose Free Trial. With that, you’ll be given a $200 Azure Credit. Give your app a name, then create an SQL database. Well, it’s not needed for our app but for some reason Azure forces you to create it. Create a new app Now that our app has been created, click on App Services by the left panel to see your app. New app Click on the app, choose Deployment options, then click on GitHub. Authorize access to your repo, choose the project and branch. In my case, I have an azure branch. That’s the branch I’ll use for deploying my code to the Azure platform. Check out the deployment notifications. Now, browse to http://[yoursitename].azurewebsites.net. In my case, it is http://starwarzapp.azurewebsites.net. Oops!, there is an HTTP 500 error. What’s happening? Okay, we need to set the environment variables again. Go to your app in App Services, click on Application Settings, and then add the environment variables to the right. Now grab the app URL, in my case it is http://starwarzapp.azurewebsites.net/ and add to Allowed Origins(CORS) and Allowed Callback URLs in your Auth0 dashboard. By default, azure deployment doesn’t do anything with our composer.json or composer.lock file. So, no package is getting installed. Now go back to App Services, click on your app, then go to Development Tools and select Extension. Choose the Composer extension and agree to the legal conditions. Now, make a little change to your app and push again to GitHub. You should see it deploying like so: Now check out your app again. It should be live and working! Database, Caching & Cron Jobs Microsoft Azure offers Azure Redis Cache. It is based on the popular open source Redis cache. It’s easy to create and use like so: Click New > Data + Storage > Redis Cache. Enter the name of the cache, select the region and create it. Check out the documentation on how to use it. For scheduling and running tasks, Azure offers a Scheduler. It allows you to: Call services inside or outside of Azure. Run jobs on any schedule. Use Azure Storage queues for long-running or offline jobs. Invoke Azure Service Bus queues. Check out how to create and manage jobs using the Scheduler. We already talked a little about setting up a database while we were deploying our app, but let’s quickly look at how to set up a MySQL database. Log into the Azure Portal. Click New in the left panel of the dashboard. Choose Data + Storage in the Marketplace, then select MySQL database. Go ahead and configure your new MySQL database. Enter a name, choose your subscription, location and fill the required fields. Create! Connect to the database. Laravel developers can easily configure a MySQL database for their apps on Azure. Amazon Web Services More companies use AWS (Amazon Web Services) for storing all sorts of data ranging from images and mp3 files to videos than any other cloud platform. In fact, a lot of organizations like Uber, Spotify, or Salesforce use Amazon Web Services completely – for hosting, deployment, and infrastructure. AWS has a ton of developer products. The service we’ll use for deploying our famous StarWars app is Amazon Elastic Beanstalk. Let’s get started. Sign up for an AWS account if you don’t have one. Head over to Elastic Beanstalk console. Create a new app. Click on create web server. Create the webserver environment. Upload your code. Elastic Beanstalk requires that you upload a zip file of your codebase. You can manually zip it up, but I prefer to do that from my terminal like so: zip ../starwarsapp.zip -r * .[^.]* Now, upload it to AWS like so: Check availability for the app URL. Mine looks like this: The next page allows us to configure a database Instance. Our app doesn’t require one, so we can skip this. This step allows us to modify our configuration details. The default one is okay for our app. Now, add your environment variables like so: Now grab the URL, in my case it is http://starwarzapp.us-west-2.elasticbeanstalk.com and add to Allowed Origins(CORS) and Allowed Callback URLs in your Auth0 dashboard. Ensure that you add it as an environment variable in Elastic Beanstalk too. Add Permission like so: Review the information before launching. Launch. Live app Check out how to deploy: A Laravel app to Elastic Beanstalk. A CakePHP app to Elastic Beanstalk. A Symfony2 app to Elastic Beanstalk. A WordPress website to Elastic Beanstalk. A Drupal website to Elastic Beanstalk. Database, Caching and Cron Jobs You can use an Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) DB instance to store data gathered and modified by your application. The database can be attached to your environment and managed by Elastic Beanstalk, or created and managed externally. Check out how to easily add a DB instance to your app. For caching, Amazon Web Services offers ElastiCache. It is a web service that makes it easy to deploy, operate, and scale an in-memory data store or cache in the cloud. Amazon ElastiCache supports two open-source in-memory engines: Redis. Memcached. Amazon ElastiCache automatically detects and replaces failed nodes, reducing the overhead associated with self-managed infrastructures and provides a resilient system that mitigates the risk of overloaded databases, which slow down websites and increase application load times. Through integration with Amazon CloudWatch, Amazon ElastiCache provides enhanced visibility into key performance metrics associated with your Redis or Memcached nodes. Companies like AirBnb, Healthguru, PlaceIQ and Tokyo Data Network use ElastiCache for caching at multiple layers spanning HTML fragments, results of expensive DB queries, ephemeral session data, and search results. Check out how to install the ElastiCache Cluster Client for PHP here. Here is an excellent post on building a PHP visitor counter with ElastiCache and Elastic Beanstalk You can set up a cron job on Elastic Beanstalk. Learn how to run cron jobs on Amazon Web Services(AWS) Elastic Beanstalk. Laravel Forge Laravel Forge , created by Taylor Otwell is a platform that helps you deploy and launch your application in minutes. It does the heavy-lifting for you. Forge takes care of provisioning your servers on popular cloud hosting providers such as Linode, Digital Ocean and AWS. It was initially built for Laravel apps, but now it has support for virtually any PHP application. Laravel Forge Laravel Forge allows you to easily do the following, apart from provisioning servers: It integrates with LetsEncrypt to generate Free SSL Certificates for your apps. Easily manage jobs and queues. Collaboration with your team by sharing your server’s management dashboard with co-workers. Matt Stauffer has an amazing post on deploying your first Laravel app to Forge. James Fairhurst also has a great guide on using Laravel Forge to setup an AWS Server. The most popular educational PHP platform, laracasts.com has a series on server management with Forge. And of course, we mention it in our Laravel course, and also cover it in in-depth tutorials like these. Envoyer Envoyer is a platform that allows zero downtime PHP deployment – it’s the SaaS version of Envoy. It allows you integrate with various services such as Gitlab, Slack, Bitbucket e.t.c. With Envoyer, you can perform: Seamless Deployment rollbacks. Deploy to multiple servers. Monitor Cron Jobs. Perform Application Health Checks. Deployer Deployer is a deployment tool for PHP. It allows you to do the following: Run tasks in parallel. Atomic deploys. Rollbacks. Create deployment scripts in form of recipes. It works with Laravel, Symfony, CakePHP, Yiiframework, Zend, FuelPHP, Drupal, WordPress, and Magento. Check out this excellent article on deploying PHP applications with Deployer. Conclusion There is no way we can cover all the different options available for deploying PHP applications. PHP is an enterprise language that has evolved over the years, thus calling for more efficient ways for deploying PHP apps from one’s local machine to production. Hopefully, this guide covers all your basic needs for deploying your PHP apps to all the major cloud providers. However, there is another resource I recommend for extensive knowledge in learning to deploy PHP applications. How have you been handling your deployments?

SitePoint Readers Get Up To 65% OFF Now More from this author 13 of the Best WordPress Magazine Themes How to Integrate APM and Log Management: Loggly and New Relic Ever since Google started taking HTTPS into consideration as a ranking factor in 2014, people have slowly been switching their sites over to use encrypted connections. This can be one reason to set up SSL to secure WordPress – SEO. However, as of January 2017, Google made things a bit more serious by having Chrome indicate that sites which still use HTTP are insecure. When a site uses a form that gathers potentially private user data, such as login credentials, there’s an even more stringent notification showing that the site is not secure. These notifications are still in a gray color, but it probably won’t take long before we start seeing the red notification messages for all of these situations. These red messages are already visible when there is, in fact, an SSL certificate in place, but it can’t be verified. And it isn’t just Chrome — browsers like Safari, Internet Explorer and Firefox all have similar ways of showing the security, or the lack of security, on a site. An added benefit is having your site served over HTTPS is that you can make use of HTTP/2, for which SSL is a requirement. So there’s no better time than now to make the switch. In this article I will show you three ways to get the green padlock: Using CloudFlare to secure your site with a generic SSL certificate the easy way. Using Let’s Encrypt to get domain level encryption. Getting an Extended Validation SSL to achieve the highest level of certificate, wíth your business name shown instead of just the “Secure” notice. Securing WordPress the Easy Way: CloudFlare SSL Using CloudFlare to secure your site is the easiest way to do it, but it does have some caveats. Kray Mitchell did a great tutorial on how to install CloudFlare, along with its Universal SSL feature. The process is very simple: Sign up for CloudFlare, change the DNS of your site to activate CloudFlare, and turn on “Flexible SSL” in the “Crypto” section. To make it even easier, you can have CloudFlare overwrite links to non-secure URLs with the HTTPS version to prevent mixed content warnings. You do this by turning on “Automatic HTTPS Rewrites,” at the bottom of the “Crypto” section. If you install the CloudFlare WordPress plugin you can specify some of the required settings from within the WP admin. Additionally it helps to overcome an infinite loop that’s triggered sometimes when changing the URL structure to HTTPS, by modifying the header. The plugin is also the easiest way to setup Server Push, which is one of the main benefits of HTTP/2. It is really that simple! But there are two important points to acknowledge: Flexible SSL only encrypts traffic between the browser and CloudFlare. This means the traffic between CloudFlare and your site (on the origin server) is unencrypted, which still leaves room for a “Man-in-the-Middle” attack. This method also isn’t allowed when you’re using forms to sensitive information like credit card data or passwords. To be clear: You can’t use this method for e-commerce sites. CloudFlare is using a shared SSL certificate, which means that your visitors won’t be able to verify it’s really you behind the scenes. Even though most visitors won’t go through the effort of checking a certificate, it’s still something to keep in mind. Again, when it comes to becoming PCI compliant for e-commerce (maintaining an SSL certificate is one of the steps), this isn’t allowed. CloudFlare also offers “Full” and “Full (Strict)” SSL protection. The latter also validates the certificate on the origin server, which at least mitigates the first point above. However, it is still a shared certificate. For $5 per month, you can order a dedicated certificate, but there are cheaper ways to do this; for example, using Let’s Encrypt, which is covered later in this post. CloudFlare Flexible SSL is a simple way to get your site secure, but, as you’ve seen here, it gives a bit of a false sense of security. While this will prevent any punishment Google can come up with, it won’t always be the best way to actually secure your site and its visitors. But, for a basic informational site, this will do the trick. Domain Validation for Free: Let’s Encrypt Let’s Encrypt is a non-profit certificate authority where you can get a free Domain Validation SSL certificate. This means you will be issued a certificate for your own domain name, instead of a shared SSL. And because of the growing support of many large and medium sized hosting providers, the steps to implement it and create a more secure WordPress site are growing less difficult. On a mission to make the web more secure, Let’s Encrypt has automated the process of issuing certificates at the domain level, which is the lowest level of protection. There’s a manual route to get the certificate yourself. Or you could ask your host to assist you. Most hosting providers are willing to provide an SSL certificate installation for free, or for just a nominal fee. The easiest way is to find a host which offers Let’s Encrypt support. With Let’s Encrypt certificates, you have to keep in mind that they expire every 90 days. In their Why 90 Days post, the organization explains that the main reason they do this is because it limits damage from key compromise, and mis-issuance. They also think it encourages automation, which many supported providers have in place. While their reasons are valid, it requires you to either ensure your certificate is automatically renewed, whether by your hosting provider or by a process that you have set up, or to do this manually yourself every 90 days. If not, you’ll still end up with the dreaded “insecure” message. WordPress hosts like WPEngine, Dreamhost, and SiteGround either have this automation already in place, or instructions on to have their support handle it for you. Most decent hosts shouldn’t charge you for the Let’s Encrypt certificate or the installation. Dealing with Mixed Content There’s one caveat, though, which you will also experience with the EV certificates covered later in this post. Unlike with CloudFlare, you have to make sure yourself that all resources are loaded over HTTPS. If not, you will see the dreaded mixed content notification. This results in images and CSS scripts not being loaded, which means your layout will be messed up. The most important thing to do is changing the WordPress address to the HTTPS version, as this will change most files and images to be loaded over HTTPS right away, if you use relative paths to call them. You can’t always spot straight away that you’re serving mixed content. In some cases, the padlock just won’t turn green, where in other cases it does. This has mostly to do with your browser cache. Sometimes a site may display a secure notice, but the developer console in Chrome shows otherwise. Luckily, the security tab of the console is very helpful in tracing these issues. In this example, it was all a matter of changing the WordPress URL to the proper HTTPS version, after which it was all green. Another issue can be the use of absolute URLs for images, which might still be served over HTTP. There are various ways to solve this: Change the URLs in the database manually from HTTP to HTTPS or to relative URLs. Use a plugin to change the links, such as the SSL Insecure Content Fixer. Go through all of your images one by one, to make their paths relative. If you use a CDN, make sure to have that changed to SSL, or else you will still be serving insecure files. The Ultimate Solution: Extended Validation Extended Validation (EV) certificates, rather than just showing “Secure”, display your business name, indicating that you’ve gone through a process to validate that your business is, in fact, what you say it is. An EV certificate provides the highest level of security because both the domain used and the organization behind it are vetted. It’s also backed by a warranty which compensates the end user, should the site owner (you) have obtained the certificate on fraudulent pretenses, and something goes wrong. While this warranty won’t benefit you directly, it helps to assure your visitor that you are trustworthy. In addition, the added vanity effect this certificate has is great. For example, on mobile Safari: So how you get an EV SSL certificate? Well, it certainly requires more effort and paperwork than with CloudFlare and Let’s Encrypt, as it isn’t called “extended validation” for nothing! The following steps are involved: Ordering the certificate Documents: This typically involves a signed agreement to request the certificate, identify the requester, and for the legal warranties. Verification of business documents: The paperwork about the business. Verification behind the scenes: The CA will do research to verify information about your business, and about you. Verification by phone: Both for the certificate requester and for the business contact. My Experience With Extended Validation I ordered an extended validation certificate for a website of mine, and the process went relatively smoothly. I’ve briefly documented the required steps here to give you an inside look into the process. Step 1: Ordering the Certificate Domain validation is part of the whole process, and NameCheap has a few steps in place to set this up, after which Comodo takes over. I ordered a Comodo EV SSL certificate, which you can get at most larger registrars, as well directly from Comodo. Step 2: Signed Documents I first needed to sign a certificate request by hand, which was followed up by a more extensive certificate subscriber agreement. The first form was used to identify both my company and me, as well as the domain involved. This is also where I needed to fill in my Assumed Name (Let’s Grind Some Coffee), to be used instead of my business name. Next up was up 8-page subscriber agreement, which is used to cover the all the legal implications that come with a certificate. Both forms are used in step 4, where I had to verify myself, the application, and my business by phone. While this document isn’t something to worry about, it is used to set the boundaries for certification fraud. All documents had to be printed, signed, scanned, and sent back. Step 3: Verification of Business Documents As my business was incorporated in the Netherlands, the Comodo verification team didn’t have access to the local Chamber of Commerce register. I had to send in an extract of my registration, which was a digitally signed document. Important note about Assumed Names: If you intend to use an Assumed Name, it’s important that you have this name registered as a trade name prior to your EV application. If you don’t have a trade name registered, you can’t have an Assumed Name in your certificate. Step 4: Verification Behind the Scenes I don’t know all the actions which were performed as a part of their verification, of course. However, investigators can check social profiles, such as LinkedIn, use tools like Google Maps to check the physical location of your company, or potentially even send someone to the listed address to check it out. As both I and my company were easy to find on the internet, this step didn’t cause any real delay, but depending on the circumstances, it could take longer than it did in my case. Step 5: Verification by Phone The final step was for them to call me to verify my request, business details and domain name, and actually speak to me. The call lasted a few minutes, where I had to answer a few verification questions like “Are you Jacco Blankenspoor?“, “For which domain name are you requesting this certificate?“. The agent confirmed everything was correct, and that I would receive my certificate within a day. A few hours later, I received the mail containing both my certificate, as well as a Comodo Trust logo to display on my site. The whole process requires quite a bit of paperwork. If you’re just interested in getting a regular SSL certificate, with just the green padlock and not your business name, any regular domain validated SSL certificate will do. In either case, once you have it, all you have to do then is get it uploaded to your hosting environment, which you can check your host’s support are for instructions on doing. Conclusion Whether you get a basic Domain Validation certification or go full-on with an Extended Validation certification to have your business name displayed, it’s now easier than it ever was before to build a secure WordPress site, and make your users feel safe. In the end, it comes down to this: A CloudFlare certificate is the most convenient process of all. It will do, but given all of its downsides, this wouldn’t be my preferred choice. If you’re looking for basic security, a free Let’s Encrypt certificate will do and shouldn’t be too much of a hassle to get up and running. Also, it will keep Google off your back about your site being insecure. If maximum security and maximum customer peace of mind is what you’re after, an EV certificate is what you need. If you have any questions, please let me know in the comments, where I am happy to help.
