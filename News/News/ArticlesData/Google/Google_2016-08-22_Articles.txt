Image Credit: AP Comcast's shady pricing plan is proof your cable provider is screwing you over By Melanie Ehrenkranz August 23, 2016 SHARE TWEET PIN If you're a Comcast customer in Atlanta, a city wired for Google's superfast Fiber internet, your pricing options are pretty decent. Comcast's Gigabit internet service is priced at $70 a month with a three-year contract, or $140 a month without one. Fiber's Gigabit internet is also $70, but with a one-year commitment for single-family homes. But for Comcast customers in Chicago, where Google has yet to install its deliciously speedy fiber-optic cables, the only option available was the $140-a-month no-contract option, Ars Technica reported on Sunday.  A few hours after Ars Technica's story ran, a Comcast representative gave the site a different story: The cheaper option is available in Chicago. Comcast just didn't "promote" it. This information is "contrary to what the company told us this morning," Ars Technica reported. Source: Erik Schelzig/AP Comcast's shady pricing is a great example of how cable companies aim to maintain their stronghold on monopolies on certain areas — and how this screws over customers.  It may sound childish (or cruel) for a cable company to try and hide better options for its customers in areas with fewer alternatives. But remember, this is the same company that's in a contentious debate over poles: The fight among cable companies for customers and land is fierce. Regional monopolies are great for Comcast's bottom line, and competing with Verizon for the same space is simply bad business — it could result in crushing costs to build your own network in the area. Local competition, though, as Mat Honan pointed out in Gizmodo in 2011, is what can help drive down prices for cable customers. When Comcast makes better pricing options available only to regions with competition, it's screwing over those who don't have a cheaper or better alternative where they live. Hate Comcast? Frustrated with spiking costs and poor customer service? That's too bad — you can't switch. As the internet becomes more and more indispensable, corporations have a tight grip on its access. Faced with no other solution, some engineering experts are taking matters into their own hands and building what's called a DIY mesh network. Activists are holding the company accountable as part of the CAP Comcast campaign in Philadelphia. So for the rest of us, the choice is clear: Suck it up or mobilize.

While Google has yet to announce a release date for its own headset and controller, the platform it's created as a standard for other developers has been in the works for a while, Bloomberg reports. On track for a fall release, Google Daydream is also putting together a suite of original content to showcase the VR platform's capabilities - ranging from 360-degree YouTube videos to partnerships with major game companies and sports leagues. Android phones will also receive a software update this coming Monday that adds Daydream support, though only a small number of devices, like the ZTE Axon 7, have the technical prowess to fully optimize Daydream at this time. The VR market is far from barren - with top shelf gaming headsets like the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive to smartphone-powered equivalents like Gear VR and Google's own Cardboard - but Daydream hopes to fill a niche by offering low-latency, high-quality virtual reality on mobile devices. Will Daydream be 'the thing' that takes VR to the mainstream? If the reports are to be believed, we may learn the answer before the holidays even begin to creep in.

Resend activation e-mail Gear & Gadgets / Product News & Reviews Google begins posting Nexus images for the Android 7.0 Nougat update [Updated] Google has started posting images for clean installs and upgrade installs. by Andrew Cunningham (US) - Aug 26, 2016 5:05 am UTC Login to bookmark 62 Enlarge Ron Amadeo Google released the final version of Android 7.0 Nougat yesterday after months of public beta testing, and people with supported Nexus phones and tablets should all be able to download it soon. But Google favors a staggered rollout for its updates so it can find and squash early bugs, and it may be several days before your phone or tablet actually offers to download and install the update for you. Impatient early adopters have a couple of options. You can download full system images that require you to wipe your device when you install them or OTA update files that can patch the operating system in place without data loss (the official OTA option is relatively new, and this is the first time Google has offered these downloads for a major update directly). Both methods require the use of the command line adb and fastboot tools and a little bit of knowhow, and you can follow the directions on those pages if you would like to give it a try. As of this writing, only the Pixel C, Wi-Fi Nexus 9, and Nexus Player files have been posted, but we'll link all the images below as they post for your convenience. These are coming directly from Google's servers, the same as they would if you were using the pages above. Update: The Nexus 5X image and OTA are up. Update 2: Two weeks later, the Nexus 6P image is up. Update 3: As of the October security update, all images are finally available. The below links have all been updated to link to the October 2016 images. Nexus 6P (Image/OTA) Nexus 5X (Image/OTA) Nexus 6 (Image/OTA) Nexus 9 Wi-Fi (Image/OTA) Nexus 9 LTE (Image/OTA) Pixel C (Image/OTA) Nexus Player (Image/OTA) The General Mobile 4G, an Android One device that is getting the Nougat update directly from Google but isn't officially part of the Nexus program, is not listed on that download page.

You can download full system images that require you to wipe your device when you install them I was wondering what a "clean install" was, as previously, that was something I associated with laptop and desktop PCs where if you build your own computer (or perhaps some vendors still do this), the hardrive comes with no OS on it. Well, on any other PC, you can also completely overwrite the OS with a new install (which of course deletes everything you had on the OS partition from before). If you use the full image (not the OTA file) without modifying them, it flashes images to all the partitions on your device, including userdata, so it is effectively a clean install. There are ways to extract the full image and not wipe your personal data, but you may as well use the OTA files for that. 761 posts | registered 5/9/2007 Reader comments 62 You must login or create an account to comment.

Nov 23 Menu Home India World Politics Entertainment Business Life Tech Auto Women Sports Photos Videos Delhi Mumbai Kolkata Hyderabad Bengaluru Chennai Health Travel Opinion Editor's pick Google’s Android Nougat Update Is Launched August 23, 2016 | Published by : ILT Staff Reporter London, Aug 23: Google is bringing its new version of Android to certain Nexus devices started, the company just announced. Developers have been able to use an early version of the software since March. But over the coming weeks, the final iteration of Android 7.0 Nougat will be making its way to the Nexus 6, Nexus 6P, Nexus 5X, Nexus 9, Nexus Player,Pixel C, and General Mobile 4G, which is part of Google’s Android One program. Any device enrolled in the Android Beta Program will also get the update, while LG’s V20 will be the first phone to come with the software out of the box when it debuts later this year. Android 7.0 Nougat brings several upgrades to Google’s mobile software, including 72 new emoji characters, the ability to open more than one app at the same time in separate windows, and support for Google’s mobile virtual reality platform, called Daydream, among other additions. Google says there are 250 new features in total. Google doesn’t typically allow developers to access the beta version of its new Android software so far ahead of its release. This year, however, the company gave app makers a longer lead time so they could optimize their software for the new platform closer to its official launch. Because Android is open source and available across a wide range of products made by different manufacturers, the wait for a new software update can sometimes take months depending on which phone you own. When Google releases a new version of Android, it must be approved, and, in some cases, modified by handset manufacturers and carriers before it arrives on your phone. This is why updates don’t reach all Android devices at the same time, as Apple’s iOS updates typically do for iPhones. The fact that Google has granted earlier access than usual to its beta program this year suggests it’s trying to expedite the rollout process moving forward.

Share Tweet Share Tags : Android-Android+ Software updates-Software updates+ Apps-Apps+ Google-Google+ Yesterday, the final version of Android 7.0 Nougat began its rollout to supported Nexus devices, Android One devices, and the Pixel C. We also learned that Google would be starting a more consistent schedule of maintenance releases for Android. What we didn't see packed in the software update were the rumored Nexus launcher or announced Google Assistant. It turns out that those two features are being held back by Google in order to launch with the new Nexus devices for the year. XDA developer and guy-in-the-know Nate Benis, who has had a hand in some of the Nexus rumor leaks this year, is saying he expects the Nexus launcher and Google Assistant to be released alongside the new Nexus devices, which seems perfectly reasonable to us. Benis also goes on to suggest the first maintenance release would be released at the same time, but we're not so sure on that one.  Benis claims Google will be releasing the new Nexus devices around the same time as last year, which makes sense and would put the release in late September. However, Google's vice president of engineering said yesterday that the first beta of Nougat maintenance release one wouldn't be pushed out until fall, which starts on September 22nd. It seems highly unlikely that the beta would push out about one week before the final version, but it also seems unlikely that Google would release the new Nexus devices without the Nexus launcher or Google Assistant.  So, we're betting that Benis is right that the Nexus launcher and Google Assistant will be released along with the new Nexus devices, but either those devices will hit later than expected, or they will be released before the first maintenance release for Android Nougat. We'll have to wait and see.  source: +Nate Benis via pocketnow Bloomberg: Google's VR platform Daydream to launch within weeks 23 Aug Prev news Touchscreen problems are affecting the Apple iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus 23 Aug Next news Close newer posts LG and B&O combine to offer premium audio experience on the LG V20 24 Aug Update to AT&T's LG V10 adds Wi-Fi calling 23 Aug Instapaper bought by Pinterest to boost article visibility on the service 23 Aug Touchscreen problems are affecting the Apple iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus 23 Aug Now reading: Nexus launcher and Google Assistant launching alongside new Nexus devices, maybe MR1 Nexus launcher and Google Assistant launching alongside new Nexus devices, 23 Aug Bloomberg: Google's VR platform Daydream to launch within weeks 23 Aug Watch your favorite team on MLB.TV over any platform for free; all you 23 Aug Deal: save a massive $160 on the Moto 360 Sport 23 Aug AT&T starts to push out Windows 10 Mobile Anniversary Update 23 Aug Verizon once again ranked king of the U.S. carriers 23 Aug older posts Featured stories   LG V20 camera tips and tricks   When will my phone get Android 7.0 Nougat?   Best high-end Samsung smartphones you can get right now (November 2016)   iPhone 7 Plus vs $1600 camera: which takes better portraits?   Nokia's return to smartphones confirmed for 2017   Bezelless Galaxy S8 and iPhone 8?

It will be the upcoming LG V20 instead. By Sambit Satpathy | Published: August 23, 2016 10:45 AM IST Email @some_bit comments Tags: Android Nougat google LG LG V20 News Last night, Google released the final version of Android Nougat 7.0, which can now be installed on select Nexus devices. But when it comes to smartphones running on the latest Android OS out-of-the-box, Google’s upcoming Nexus devices won’t be the first off the starting line. Instead, the LG V20 will be the first smartphone to run on Android Nougat — and yes Google has confirmed this as well. On the Android Nougat official page there is a message towards the bottom that reads — ‘Introducing the new LG V20, the first new smartphone that comes with Android Nougat, right out of the box. Coming soon’. Google is widely believed to have tasked HTC to develop two Nexus devices this year, which are reportedly codenamed Sailfish and Marlin. While multiple leaks have given us a fair idea on what to expect from the upcoming Nexus smartphones, what we don’t know is when Google plans to launch them. LG, on the other hand, has revealed that it plans to launch the V20 smartphone at a four-day event in San Francisco starting on September 6. We have already come across a couple of leaks and teasers by LG, and the V20 is surely shaping up to be an interesting smartphone. LG V20 specifications As per rumors, the LG V20 will feature a 5.5-inch full HD (1080p) In-Cell display, Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 820 processor, Adreno 530 GPU, and it will come in two variants — 32GB variant with 3GB of RAM, and 64GB variant with 4GB of RAM. The smartphone is also expected to feature a microSD card slot, an 8-megapixel selfie camera, fingerprint scanner, USB Type-C port and a 4,000mAh battery. Besides these, the LG V20 will boast great audio playback thanks to the 32-bit Quad DAC, and a new teaser also claims that the smartphone will offer ‘the best video and audio experience’ on a smartphone. While the rest of the details are scarce, we will know more in just about a fortnight. With the LG V20 being the first smartphone to run on Android Nougat 7.0, it takes away the one aspect that everyone looks forward to ahead of the launch of new Nexus devices. Google’s Nexus devices not only run on the purest form of Android, but also on the newest. It comes as a big surprise that Google didn’t wait till the launch of its new smartphones, and went ahead with the release of its new OS. DON’T MISS: Has Google’s Nexus smartphone program lost its sheen? From releasing Android N preview ahead of its usual schedule to making it easy for anyone to install the preview and give it a test before the final release, Google is doing things a bit differently this time around. Android Nougat 7.0 comes with a host of new features and improvements like multi-window support, inline notification reply, improved data saver and project svelte to name a few.

What am I babbling about? Nougat is here. No, not a new type of dessert, Android 7.0 Nougat. Yes, that’s right. Google has now begun rolling out the official version to its latest Android operating system. As we said in an article before, Android 7.0 Nougat will supposedly give you better battery life, a host of new multitasking features and also a bunch of new emoji. But before you dash away and mash the “Check for Updates” button on your smartphone, There’s a few things you should note. The initial devices to get the Android 7.0 Nougat update will be Google’s own Nexus 6, Nexus 5X, Nexus 6P and General Mobile 4G handsets as well as the Pixel C and Nexus 9 tablets and the Nexus Player set-top box. Sadly, the Venerable Nexus 5 made by LG despite still being a popular phone has not made the list. Let us just offer a moment of silence for all owners of the Nexus 5 who won’t be getting the official update. Image taken from http://www.theverge.com As it is with all major Android updates, the timing of the OTA (over-the-air) update will vary by carrier and also by Manufacturer. According to Google, the update should be arriving within the coming weeks for the Nexus devices though some will get it sooner. In addition, the company has also confirmed that LG’s upcoming flagship-esque V20 will be the first new device to ship with Nougat pre-installed. The rollout for non-Nexus devices from other manufacturers will vary based on carrier and device. If you already own one of the above mentioned Nexus devices and you have also been using the Developer Preview of Android Nougat, then the final result will look pretty much the same. While much of Android N’s biggest improvements were focused around improving security and performance, features such as full on split-screen mode will help you multi-task on a whole new level by allowing you to run two apps simultaneously and also 72 new emojis will give you even more emotions when texting your friends. That’s not all though. Under the hood, Google has also been tuning the performance of Android 7.0 Nougat to offer significantly better battery life compared to its predecessors. The Doze feature, initially seen in Android 6.0 Marshmallow last year, will now kick in when your phone is getting shuffled around in a pocket or a bag. Last, but by no means least, Android Nougat-equipped devices will be a lot more VR friendly. The latest operating system was optimized for Daydream, Google’s upcoming mobile VR platform and built to support better 3D graphics.

Android Nougat is the seventh major iteration of the mobile operating system and has been available to developers since March in order for them to optimise their applications. In total, Google says Nougat has 250 major new features. Multitasking is improved by the ability to run two different applications side-by-side in resizable windows and users can now reply directly from notifications. Android N Tapping the overview button twice lets a device switch between the two most recently used apps and a new customisable quick settings menu provides rapid access to functions such as Bluetooth, Wi-Fi and the torch. Battery life is now more efficient thanks to improvements to the doze feature, which automatically uses less power when the device detects it is in a bag or pocket and multiple languages are supported in search results. Google says it has boosted the overall security of Android, which is seen as a more attractive target than iOS, following on from its recent commitment to rapidly roll out patches to devices in the Nexus range – a commitment matched by Samsung and BlackBerry. Specifically, file-based encryption has been added, as has ‘direct boot’ – which helps the device start up faster and lets apps run securely even before its unlocked after a reboot. Seventy-two new emojis have been added, bringing to the total number up to more than 1,500, and support is added for the Vulkan advanced 3D rendering API for games and Google Daydream – the company’s virtual reality (VR) platform. Daydream is designed for smartphones and comprises a reference design headset alongside the aforementioned software update. Any device enrolled in the Android Beta programme will get the final version of Nougat and the Nexus 6, Nexus 5X, Nexus 6P, Nexus 9, Nexus Player, Pixel C and Android One will get an over the air (OTA) software update.

Google has released the final build of Android 7.0 Nougat to select Nexus devices on August 22. Even though Google has launched Android 7.0, it will take few days for it to reach your smartphones via OTA. Interestingly, Google hasn’t officially posted any tweets regarding the launch. If you have been following tech news for a while, developers have been testing the new Android platform by signing up for the Android beta program since last few months. There were rumors that Android 7.0 Nougat will be launched early August. This is after the popular leaker Evan Blass aka @evleaks posted a tweet with the information that Android 7 is making its way. By keeping rumors at its peak, Google has silently rolled out Android 7.0 Nougat to Nexus and Android One devices. It remains to be seen as to when Google release the Android 7.0 Nougat for all smartphones. Android 7.0 Nougat Features The Android 7.0 Nougat has been refreshed with updated Doze effect in such a way that it will work even if you are on the move. Previously, Doze effect worked only if the device has not been used for a long period of time. The new Notifications feature enables you to view all the notifications produced by a relevant app. You will be able to silence all notifications generating from the app. After Google introduced Android 7.0 Nougat preview, the most discussed feature on the tech circles was the new multi-window feature. It enables you to display two apps on two sides of your device in both landscape and portrait orientations. Meanwhile, the data saver feature enables you to prevent apps from using mobile data in the background. Google has integrated a new JIT compiler, which helps in the faster loading of apps and trimmed storage space for apps. Moreover, unused apps are automatically closed in the Recents menu to save battery life. The new Clear All button helps you to close all the running apps on the device instantly. In addition to the above features, Android 7.0 Nougat features a new Keyboard theme and support for virtual reality. Google has also infused an Easter egg buried deep into the Android 7.0 Nougat platform. How to install Android 7.0 Nougat? As mentioned above, Android 7.0 Nougat has been released to select Nexus devices. However, it will take days for the new build to reflect inside your smartphone because Google has rolled out the new version in phases. But you can install Android 7.0 Nougat without waiting for the official release if you have access to Nexus 5X, Nexus 6P, Nexus 6, Nexus 9, Nexus Player, Pixel C tablet and Android One devices. Follow the steps below to install Android 7.0 Nougat Register for the Android Beta program Select the handset for which you would like to enroll Accept the terms and select Join Beta There are reports that users are able to get the fresh updates within seconds after registration. However, Google has revealed that it will take up to 24 hours for your device to get the latest Android 7 updates. Taking into account the huge file size, it is recommended to make use of Wi-Fi to install the updates. Continue Reading You may also like...

Google has started rolling out their latest version of their mobile OS, Android 7.0 Nougat, to Nexus users all over the world. This comes almost two months after we learned the name of the OS and over 5 months since the first developer preview of what was then Android N came out. We’ve seen plenty of features surface through the five developer previews of Android Nougat Google released, like multi-window support, new emojis, an improved way of interacting with notifications, a redesigned Quick Settings pane, an improved lock screen, and plenty of stuff found under-the-hood. If you wanna know everything new inside Android 7.0, check out the list below. Expanded emoji: There are now over 1,500 different emoji built into Android, including 72 new ones, so go ahead: express yourself. Quick Settings controls: Quick Settings gives you easy access to things like bluetooth, WiFi and the all-important flashlight. With Android Nougat, you can actually control what tiles go where, and move ‘em around to fit your needs. Multi-locale support: Apps can tailor their content based on your locale settings. So if you speak multiple languages, for instance, then search engines can show results in each of those languages. Multi-window: Run two apps side-by-side. The windows are resizable, too, by simply dragging the divider. Direct Reply: Reply directly to notifications without having to open any app. Bundled notifications: See what’s new at a glance with bundled notifications from individual apps. Simply tap to view each alert. Notification controls: When a notification pops up, just press and hold to toggle the settings. For instance, you can silence future alerts from an app in the notification itself. Lockscreen wallpaper: You can now have different wallpapers on your device’s homescreen and lockscreen. Improved Settings navigation: Find the right setting faster with an updated navigation menu in Settings. Quick Switch: Switch between your two most recently used apps by simply double tapping the Overview button. Vulkan: Games will now leap to life thanks to high-speed, next-generation graphics — all powered by your device’s multi-core processor. Daydream: Android Nougat is ready to transport you to virtual worlds with Daydream-ready phones, headsets and controllers — all coming later this year. Seamless updates: New Android devices with Nougat can install software updates in the background which means you won’t have to wait while your device installs the update and optimizes all your apps for the new version. And for current Nexus users, software updates now install much faster, so you won’t have to wait for minutes while your device reboots. File-based encryption: Android Nougat can better isolate and protect files for individual users on your device. Direct Boot: Direct Boot helps your device startup faster, and apps run securely even before you unlock your device when your device reboots. Improved system backup coverage: More device settings are covered by Android Backup, including accessibility settings, run-time permissions for apps, Wi-Fi hotspot settings and Wi-Fi network restrictions. Work mode: Work mode allows you to turn on and off your device’s work apps and notifications for a better work, life balance. Display size: Not only can you change the size of the text on your device, but the size of all the display elements like icons and images. The Nexus devices to receive Android Nougat are as follows: Nexus 6P Nexus 5X Nexus 6 Nexus 9 Pixel C Nexus Player General Mobile 4G (Android One) Each of these devices will receive the update over the air, while any devices enrolled in the Android Beta Program will automatically receive the final version of Nougat via the same method. Interestingly, Google has confirmed over on the official Android Nougat webpage that the first phone to ship with Android 7.0 will be the LG V20. Of course we already knew this, but it’s nice to hear it straight from the horse’s mouth, if you will. Unfortunately, the Nexus 7 and LG’s Nexus 5 handset will not receive Android Nougat, meaning the latest update for the devices is Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow. Of course, this makes plenty of sense since the devices were released back in 2013 (the Nexus 7 even had a version of itself made in 2012), however it’s still sad since the devices are so popular. Nonetheless, we’re gonna miss the Nexus 5 and 7 around here. Rest in peace, old friends. To see if you’ve received Android 7.0 Nougat yet on your device, head over to Settings > About phone > Software Updates. If you do have the update, be sure to have at least 80% battery life and a good, stable Wi-Fi connection before installing. Otherwise, you may have serious problems with the installation process.

Here’s how to update your Nexus smartphone or tablet to the latest Android version. By Ritesh Bendre | Updated: August 23, 2016 5:22 PM IST Email @GadgetFreak4U comments Tags: Android Nougat google Google Nexus 5X Google Nexus 6 Google Nexus 6P how to News As expected, Google has started rolling out the Android 7.0 Nougat update for its range of Nexus smartphones and tablets. Being a major software release, the latest update brings a host of improvements over Android Marshmallow. Android Nougat brings in some nifty features such as multi-window support to run two apps side by side, improved notifications pane with inline replies, improved data saver to restrict background data, more tweaks to doze mode for extended battery life and more. Google has also added support for Emoji Unicode 9, Vulcan graphics API and a dedicated VR mode among others. The update is being rolled out via OTA (over-the-air) and here’s a simple guide update your Nexus smartphone. This time around, Google is going with a slightly different approach by setting a new quarterly maintenance schedule. Also, while the developer preview program is here to stay, Google has already started working on the next preview version, which is due to release this fall. “Android 7.0 Nougat will begin rolling out to users, starting with Nexus devices. At the same time, we’re pushing the Android 7.0 source code to the Android Open Source Project (AOSP), extending public availability of this new version of Android to the broader ecosystem,” Dave Burke, VP of Engineering, Android, wrote in a blog post. List of Android 7.0 Nougat supported devices As usual, users owning a Nexus smartphone or tablet will be the first ones to be treated with the latest Android Nougat update. The range of supported devices includes the current flagship smartphones — Nexus 5X and Nexus 6P, and Nexus 6, Nexus 9, the Nexus Player and the Pixel C tablet. However, sad news for Nexus 5 owners, as the smartphone has hit end of life and will remain on Android Marshmallow 6.0.1. Manufacturers such as Samsung, LG, HTC and Xiaomi among others, will also be treating their supported smartphones with goodness of Android 7.0 Nougat. However, due to the over the top customizations that OEMs put, it may take a couple of months or more till the update is ready to be rolled out. Also, not every smartphone will be updated to Android 7.0 Nougat. As of now, LG G5, HTC 10, One M9,One A9, Samsung Galaxy S7-family, Galaxy Note 7, Moto G4, Moto G4 Plus, Moto Z and Moto Z Force have been announced to get the update in the coming months. The list of smartphones may eventually increase as manufacturers start evaluating their smartphones. ALSO READ: How do you pronounce Nougat and everything else the Internet is asking about the new Android N name How to update your Nexus device to Android 7.0 Nougat via OTA Earlier this year, Google released the Android N developer Preview well ahead of its schedule. To get more users test and report bugs before official release, Google also simplified the installation process for everyone. Step One: To begin with, head over to Android Beta program page from your compatible Nexus smartphone or Pixel C tablet. Step Two: Sign in with your Google account, and scroll down to select your eligible device. Step Three: Tap on the “Enroll device” option and restart your smartphone. Step Four: By now, you should get the update notification on your smartphone. However, if you haven’t already, you can manually check for the same by heading over to Settings > About Phone > System Update > Check Now.

In case, you have already been a part of Android N Developer Preview, you should get an OTA update of around 60MB in size. As the OTA update is being rolled out in a staggered manner, it may take a while until it hits your device. Your region and carrier are other factors that may delay the update process. For those who can’t wait for the official OTA to arrive can flash the factory images. However, Google is yet to release them.

Google has just announced that Android 7.0 Nougat factory images and OTAs have started rolling out for current Nexus devices, the Pixel C and the General Mobile 4G. Android 7.0 is an important upgrade to Google’s mobile OS with multi-window support mode for most apps, redesigned notifications, and many essential performance optimizations. While the final build is almost identical to the last developer preview, it should be more stable and on your smartphone. Multi-window multitasking allows you to run two apps simultaneously, similar to the iPad when running iOS 9. This multitasking mode will probably be most useful on tablets like the Pixel C, but it works on smartphones as well and the experience is a lot better than we originally expected. Notifications are now grouped by app in the notification shade; pulling down of any app’s alerts will give you the complete list. You can also reply directly from notifications, something that iOS has actually had for longer than Android. Speaking about the rollout, the official Android blog says: “Today, and over the next several weeks, the Nexus 6, Nexus 5X, Nexus 6P, Nexus 9, Nexus Player, Pixel C and General Mobile 4G (Android One) will get an over the air software update to Android 7.0 Nougat. Any devices enrolled in the Android Beta Program will also receive this final version.” It also says that the LG V20 will be the first Android smartphone to ship with Android 7.0 out of the box. Other flagship Android devices will get the upgrade towards the end of the year or early 2017. Also, the official OTA is not available on older Nexus devices. All other smartphones and tablets will have to wait for OEMs and carriers to roll out updates. If you’ve been using the official Android 7.0 Beta program, you won’t notice a significant change, but you will still receive an update to the latest version. The Nougat OTA will likely be rolling out slowly over the course of few days or maybe few weeks. All supported devices on stock Marshmallow software will get the OTA notification, as will devices on the N preview enrolled in the beta. Check out the Android blog for more details on what can you expect from Nougat. Source: Gizmodo Share.

While Nougat is referred to as Android 7.0 (the current version - Marshmallow - is Android 6.0), the new operating system is relatively light on new functionality. Instead, Google have focused on under-the-hood improvements including better battery management, seamless security updates, and support for Vulkan (an API that will facilitate higher quality 3D graphics in apps that utilise them). Nougat isn't entirely devoid of new features though; it adds in split-screen app support as a core operating system component, features a revamped task manager, and cleaner more customisable quick settings. Later this year, Nougat will be updated with support for Daydream, Google's upcoming smartphone driven virtual reality platform. The Nexus 6, Nexus 5X, Nexus 6P, Nexus 9, and Pixel C will all start receiving over-the-air updates to Android Nougat from today, although some users may not see the upgrade for a couple of weeks (Google doesn't update all devices at a single time). All Nexus devices enrolled in the Android Beta Program will also be updated to the final version of Nougat. LG's upcoming V20 will be the first smartphone to ship with Android Nougat out of the box, although it may not see an Australian release. Google is expected to unveil a new pair of Nexus-branded smartphones to showcase Nougat's new features in the coming months.

Apart from the update being released earlier than usual, Google hasn't launched a new Nexus smartphone as the platform lead device for Nougat. The update is being rolled out over-the-air (OTA), and should reach all users gradually. (Also see: How to Download and Install Android Nougat Right Now) The Android 7.0 Nougat update is being rolled out to the Nexus 5X, Nexus 6P, Nexus 9, Nexus Player, Pixel C tablet, and Android One General Mobile 4G devices. As it's a gradual global rollout, users may not see a notification today, but should receive it within a couple of weeks. Compatible device holders can also go and manually check for the update in the Settings menu, to see if Android 7.0 Nougat has arrived or not. Users on the Android 7.0 Nougat Developer Preview builds should receive the update first, with those running Marshmallow next in line. Users can also flash the OTA update files that are slowly being released, and while users should not lose data with the sideloading of the update, they should take a backup anyway.(Also see:Android 7.0 Nougat is Here: 8 New Features You Need to Know About) The final Android 7.0 Nougat build will bring a host of improvements like multi-window support, enhanced notifications, revamped doze, and number blocking. With the final build now out, OEMs can also start building their skins on top of Android 7.0 Nougat and release it soon to their customers. The upcoming LG V20 smartphone was touted to be the first smartphone to come with Android 7.0 Nougat out-of-the-box, and Google in a post on its Android website has confirmed this. Alongside the rollout, the tech giant has also announced that it is moving Android to a regular maintenance cycle. This cycle will continue for the next few quarters, and Google has shared few details about the next update. While Google remains discreet on what the next update will hold, it has announced that it will be released as a preview version first. This means Google is continuing its Android Beta Program for users who want to tinker with the update ahead of everyone else. The developer preview will be released this fall, and the stable version will then be released soon after that. "We're moving Nougat into a new regular maintenance schedule over the coming quarters. In fact, we've already started work on the first Nougat maintenance release, that will bring continued refinements and polish, and we're planning to bring that to you this fall as a developer preview. Stay tuned," said Dave Burke, Engineering VP in a blog post. Releasing the final build of Android 7.0 Nougat without the Nexus phone is a shift from Google's traditional pattern. However, the maintenance cycle announcement does hint that the new Nexus phones may just be released with a newer version of Android Nougat.

By: FE Online | New Delhi | Updated: August 23, 2016 12:15 PM It might be exciting to have a new Android update from Google, it has to be understood that phones which are not in the most recent Nexus series will have to wait a few months for this. (Reuters) Google’s new operating system for the Android phones, Android 7.0 Nougat is to roll out to the relatively newer Nexus devices on Tuesday. It is being called a good update to its predecessor with better and newer features, but would only be available to the users of the most recent Nexus devices like Nexus 6, Nexus 6P, Nexus 5X and the Nexus Pixel C or the Nexus 9 tablet. Though the new update should not be expected to have radical changes in the system, it does come with notable user-facing features. A few of them, like the split screen and improved multi-tasking, were well overdue and especially useful on tablets. Meanwhile, LG seems to have taken a lead in the game ahead of its competitors by suggesting that its new LG V20 might be the first phone to be launched with an inbuilt Android 7.0 Nougat. Talking to reporters on Monday, the company clarified that the LG V20 would be the first phone to feature Android 7.0 “out of the box”. Though to clarify the air of confusion, it must be understood that the LG V20 will not be the first phone to use the Android 7.0 Nougat as an Operating System, instead, it would be the first to be shipped and sold with it, while the other existing Nexus devices would get an update instead. While it might be exciting to have a new Android update from Google, it has to be understood that phones which are not in the most recent Nexus series will have to wait a few months for this. The Android Nougat 7.0 might be made available to the market today, but one has to wait and see for the next few months about what other phones the update reaches to and when.

According to Google, the release will be available starting today and over the next several weeks as a free update on a number of Nexus smartphones and tablets, including the Nexus 6, Nexus 5X, Nexus 6P, Nexus 9, Nexus Player, Pixel C and General Mobile 4G (Android One). Nexus users can check if the update is available via the “About Phone” option in their settings menu. Devices that are enrolled in the Android Beta Program will also be able to get the final version of Nougat, Google said. Roll outs to other Android deices will come further down the line once manufacturers like Samsung and HTC make their own iterations of the OS available to users. LG’s next flagship device, the LG V20, will become the first smartphone to ship with Android Nougat already installed when it launches in the third quarter, Google said. Android Nougat comes with a number of new features, including more ways for users to customize their device via homescreen widgets, adjustable Quick Settings controls and expanded emojis; productivity enhancements via support for side-by-side multi-window capabilities, direct replies to notifications without having to open apps and a Quick Switch feature for a users’ two most used apps; and smarter battery usage via the Doze feature. The update will also come with a Data Saver feature for data conscious users that will block background apps from accessing cellular data. Google said it also worked to make the Android OS more secure with new features in Nougat, including background software updates, file-based encryption and Direct Boot to allow apps to run securely before a device is unlocked. The release of Nougat comes just ahead of the expected release of Apple’s latest iOS update next month.

There are over 250 major features in Android Nougat.” Speaking about the features of the new operating system, Android N provides more ways of customization including  over 1,500 different emoji, Quick Settings that can give you easy access to Bluetooth, WiFi, and Flashlight. With Android Nougat, you can actually control what tiles go where, and move ‘em around to fit ones needs. Android 7.0 Nougat is built with powerful layers of security and encryption to keep data private and secure. For new devices coming this fall, Google has also added new features like Seamless updates, File-based encryption and and Direct Boot. Starting with the release of Android Marshmallow last year, Google has been making the battery smarter. With Android 7.0 Nougat the Doze feature has been made even more dozier. Android  devices can now drop into lower power usage when it’s getting jostled around in your pocket or bag while on the move.   TAGS: Android 7.0 Nougat, Android N, Android Nougat View the discussion thread.   TechTree Recommends Best Phones Under Rs 10,000 (November, 2016) Best Phones Under Rs 20,000 (November, 2016) Best Phones Under Rs 30,000 (November, 2016) Five Android Apps To Make Your Insta Pop 9 Hot Android Smartphones Expected To Hit The Shelves Soon 3 Fitness Bands For The Budget Users 5 Best Screens From Android Based Smartphones The 5 Browser Add-Ons That Everyone Must Have Top 5 Pocket Friendly Virtual Reality Headsets Top 5 Premium Smartphones Above Rs 30,000 Opinion Poll Following the battery debacle, would you still buy the Samsung Galaxy Note 7?

Google is having none of it, and has announced that it may start penalizing developers who employ such practices starting next year. Google will continue to give precedence to sites with design that are optimal for mobile use, but will remove the “mobile-friendly” label it used to highlight such sites. 85 percent of all sites now are usable on mobile devices, so Google no longer saw this as necessary. New to its ranking criteria is a check for what is called an “interstitial.” A good example are the ads that appear before you’re given access to the content, or appear “over” the content. Developers have even gotten good enough that Google still can index the content below the interstitial, even though you can’t see it. Related: Google is including ads in image search results for the first time Google will check for interstitials after January 10, 2017. “Pages that show intrusive interstitials provide a poorer experience to users than other pages where content is immediately accessible,” product manager Doantam Phan said. “This can be problematic on mobile devices where screens are often smaller.” Phan does say there are some interstitials which wouldn’t be affected by the new policy, including those that alert about cookie usage or ask a user to verify their age, or ones that take up a “reasonable” amount of screen space. Phan pointed to the installation of banners as an example of a reasonable use of space. Despite the new rules, relevance of content is still a very strong ranking signal, so there still could be cases where sites that use interstitials in a way that Google now frowns upon still rank high in results. “The intent of the search query is still a very strong signal, so a page may still rank highly if it has great, relevant content,” Phan explained.

Follow TechnoBuffalo A major component of Allo, an upcoming messaging platform from Google, is Google Assistant, a smarter, more focused personal assistant. And while we already know it can understand text commands, it turns out it can also understand and respond to voice messages, too. Thanks to a leak from Android Police, Google Assistant is capable of understanding voice messages about sports, the weather, news, and a host of other general commands and queries; as you’d expect, it’s like being able to perform a Google search right from within Allo. Based on the screenshots demonstrating the feature, Google Assistant’s ability to understand voice commands appears to work flawlessly. However, the search queries in the examples above aren’t particularly complex; Siri, Alexa, Hound, and myriad other personal assistants are just as capable. That being said, Google Assistant seems like it integrates very well with Allo, which we’re still waiting for Google to release.

However, right now it is available only on select Nexus devices.

Manually update to Android Nougat If you are not updating via the beta program for some reason, you can try this method, but this is not recommended as it involves flashing that will erase all the data if something goes wrong. Proceed with this only after a backup. You need to do this with the Android Debug Bridge on your PC and from the Developer Options. Make sure you Backup your phone Before you opt for a Nougat update on your phone, remember to backup all your files including contacts, photos, videos, and other necessary app data.

Initially, all of the handsets that participated in Google’s Android betame program will be updated with the final version of Android 7.0. Thereafter, Android Nougat will be rolled out to the Nexus 6, Nexus 5X, Nexus 6P, Nexus 9, Nexus Player, and Pixel C as well units from the low-cost Android One range. Manufacturers of devices running Android are expected to rapidly publish schedules for their updates, although it is worth noting that smartphones and tablets that make use of an in-house user interface layer (as is the case with Samsung products) are not expected to run Android Nougat before 2017. The LG V20, which is expected to launch in September, will be the first model to ship with Android Nougat, followed naturally by the new Nexus models. These are rumored to include two new 5-inch smartphones from HTC (codenamed Sailfish and Marlin) and a larger handset from Huawei in a similar style to the current 6P. However, no information has been released on their future availability. More than 250 new features Presented in May 2016 at the Google I/0 conference, the latest version of Android is packed with new features. Most notably, it will be equipped with a module to combat viruses. Android Nougat will analyze handsets whenever they are powered on and will have the capability to prevent them from booting or to restrict them to a limited-use mode if viruses are detected. Android Nougat will also feature a multi-window mode that will enable users to simultaneously view two applications side by side (on tablets) or superimposed over each other (smartphones): a long-awaited functionality that has already been provided on certain Samsung and LG products, and by competing iOS and Windows systems. Notifications will be simpler and easier to use with Nougat, and thanks to a “picture in picture” (PIP) system, users will now be able to take advantage of more options when viewing videos — which can now be consigned to a corner of the display — and new energy- and bandwidth-saving features. Finally, Google has built in an expanded offer of more 1,500 emojis in Android Nougat.

We asked every major manufacturer Julian Chokkattu Digital TrendsNovember 4, 2016 Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share Android 7.0 Nougat is finally here, but it's only available for select devices. We've reached out to most device manufacturers to find out when and if your smartphone is getting it. Here's everything you need to know.More After more than 5 months in beta, Google has officially rolled out the latest version of the Android mobile operating system — Android 7.0 Nougat. The update is rolling out to the Nexus 6, Nexus 5X, Nexus 6P, Nexus 9, Nexus Player, and Pixel C devices, as well as the General Mobile 4G, an Android One smartphone. Any other devices enrolled in the Android Beta Program, such as the Sony Xperia Z3, will also get the update. Related: We noshed on Nougat, and Android 7.0 is Google’s sweetest update yet Ultimately, that’s a relatively small number of smartphones and tablets compared to the billion-plus Android devices that are active around the world. Android is notorious for its fragmentation — even if Google pushes an update, manufacturers and carriers have to test and roll it out separately, and the process usually takes months. It’s why several handsets like BlackBerry’s Priv and the OnePlus 2 received the Android Marshmallow update more than 6 months after Marshmallow launched. A lot of smartphone manufacturers haven’t explicitly named a date or time range for when we can expect a Nougat update. Few have mentioned specific devices that will certainly be getting it, and of course, a carrier-branded device will also slow these updates even further. Still, we will continue to update this article as we learn more. In the meantime, here’s which devices are expected to get Android 7.0 Nougat and when we expect to see the update arrive. Nexus, Pixel C, and Android One devices and Android 7.0 Nougat Google’s Nexus devices are almost always the first smartphones and tablets to receive version updates first, and that hasn’t changed with Nougat. The updates should already be available to install for: Google Nexus 6 Google Nexus 5X Google Nexus 6P Google Nexus 9 Google Nexus Player Google Pixel C General Mobile 4G (Android One) Just head over to the About Phone section in your device’s Settings app. Tap on System updates and then Check for update. You should get a notification saying there’s an update ready to install. Older Nexus devices like the Nexus 5 and the Nexus 7 (2013) are not receiving the Nougat update. Related: Google marks concrete dates for Nexus device update life cycle Google’s surprise tablet from 2015, the Pixel C, is also receiving the update as its an Android device straight from Google. Android One devices, budget devices running stock Android available only in developing markets, aren’t mentioned except for General Mobile’s 4G handset, which should also be receiving the update. The search giant seems to have forgotten about Android One, considering its website for the program claims 2014’s Android 5.1 Lollipop to be the “latest and fastest” version of Android. Samsung devices and Android 7.0 Nougat Samsung has a lot of devices, and many of them aren’t going to make the cut for an update. The company is also notorious for its slow updates — the Galaxy S6 lineup was updated to Android 6.0 Marshmallow more than 5 months after Google published it. Still, here’s a list of flagship devices we can expect to get 7.0 Nougat: Samsung Galaxy S6 Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge Plus Samsung Galaxy S7 Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge Samsung Galaxy Note 5 Samsung Galaxy S7 Active Samsung Galaxy J3 Most recently, it seems like Samsung has been beta testing Nougat on U.K. Galaxy S7 owners, suggesting that the company may be looking to quicken its upgrade pace. You have to be a part of the Galaxy Beta Program to get the update, but if you’re not interested in doing so since it’s a beta, you may well get a consumer version of Nougat in the next month or so. Lining up with the new beta tests is a report from SamMobile, which is known for leaking Samsung news. The report highlights that Samsung is looking to push the Nougat update to its flagship phones in the fourth quarter of 2016, meaning that it should arrive sometime before the end of the year on the Galaxy S6, S6 Edge, S6 Edge Plus, Note 5, S7, and S7 Edge. And then there’s the Galaxy Note 7. We should mention, if you still have a Galaxy Note 7, you should really return it. It won’t be getting any Android updates, since it’s been recalled for safety reasons. LG devices and Android 7.0 Nougat In a surprise announcement, the upcoming LG V20 will be the first smartphone that comes pre-loaded with Android 7.0 Nougat — a title typically held by Google’s Nexus devices. Devices that should be receiving the update include: LG G5 LG V10 LG G4 LG V20 While unconfirmed, most of LG’s previous devices should make the jump to 7.0 — notably the LG G5 and the V10. The company has gotten a lot better about updating its smartphones — the G4, for example, began receiving Marshmallow within 3 months of its release. Read More “We’re excited to share that our next flagship smartphone, LG V20, will be the first new device with Android 7.0 Nougat operating system preloaded, when it begins shipping in the third quarter,” Frank Lee, LG’s public relations director, tells Digital Trends. “We’ll be sharing more about our ‘tasty’ plans for other devices in the weeks and months to come.” Related: LG unveils three new speakers, each offering 360 degrees of sound HTC devices and Android 7.0 Nougat HTC is one of the only manufacturers to outright confirm a Nougat update for its devices. The lucky ones are: HTC 10 HTC One A9 HTC One M9 HTC is generally pretty quick with its Android updates — the One M8 received Android 6.0 Marshmallow just two months after the update was released. The company even has a website you can visit to check the status of the Nougat update. “We’re excited to receive final shipping Android 7.0 Nougat software from Google,” an HTC spokesperson told Digital Trends. “We expect the update to begin rolling out to the unlocked HTC 10 in Q4, followed by unlocked HTC One M9, unlocked HTC One A9, and carrier versions of these devices.” HTC also built Google’s first self-designed devices, called the Pixel and Pixel XL. Considering the strong partnership between the two companies, HTC’s smartphones should get updates relatively quickly. Motorola devices and Android 7.0 Nougat Motorola, now owned by Lenovo, has quite the number of devices under its belt that theoretically should be upgraded to Android 7.0 Nougat — that is if you use the 18-month life-cycle most manufacturers tend to follow. Motorola has confirmed with Digital Trends that the following devices will definitely get the Nougat update: Moto Z Droid Moto Z Force Droid Moto G4 Moto G4 Plus Moto G4 Play There’s no reason that last year’s models shouldn’t receive the update as well, though. That includes: Moto X Style Pure Edition Droid Turbo 2 (Moto X Force) Droid Maxx 2 (Moto X Play) Moto G (2015) Moto E (2015) The Moto Z Droid and Moto Z Force Droid are carrier locked to Verizon, so the updates will ultimately have to go through Big Red — that could add a few months to the wait time. Additionally, Motorola dropped from being one of the best Android manufacturers in terms of updates, to one of the worst. The company completely abandoned support for the U.S. carrier-variants of the Moto X (2014) after Marshmallow came out only a year later. Still, the Moto X Style and Play received the Marshmallow update within the first two to four months of its release. A Motorola spokesperson tells Digital Trends the company will begin evaluating upgrade opportunities, and also said the following: “Android upgrades are complex, resource-intensive projects, and unfortunately, it isn’t practical for us to bring every upgrade to every device in our portfolio,” a Motorola spokesperson said. “The decision whether to upgrade a device is made on a case-by-case basis with several factors in mind, including carrier approvals, partner support, the capabilities of the device, number of devices in use, where the device is in its lifecycle and the overall experience. We will continue to communicate upgrade paths on our software page.” We suggest not expecting an update for most of the aforementioned 2015 devices. ZTE devices and Android 7.0 Nougat Hot off the release of two well-received smartphones, the Axon 7 and the budget-tier ZMax Pro, ZTE tells Digital Trends it has plans to update the Axon 7 with Nougat “very soon.” It also has a plethora of other devices that should make the jump to the new Android version: ZTE Axon 7 ZTE ZMax Pro ZTE Axon Elite ZTE Axon Pro ZTE Axon Max ZTE Axon ZTE ZMax 2 ZTE Blade V7 “ZTE has no official announcement being made for other device updates and timelines,” a spokesperson tells Digital Trends. Most of the aforementioned devices are hard to buy or available only in select markets, and the only relatively-new phones listed on ZTE USA’s website are the Axon 7, the original Axon, Axon Pro, and the ZMax Pro. Still, these devices should receive Nougat considering most are only a little over a year old. We’ll learn more about the update process for each of these devices soon, and we’ll update this post as soon as we find out. OnePlus devices and Android 7.0 Nougat OnePlus is a little different when it comes to device updates. The OnePlus One runs Cyanogen OS, while the newer devices run OxygenOS. It’s all custom ROMs, but they’re based on the various Android versions. The devices that should get the Nougat update are: OnePlus 3 OnePlus X OnePlus 2 OnePlus 1 Interestingly enough, it seems as though updates might be in the works a little sooner than expected. The OnePlus 1 have been spotted in GeekBench logs running the latest version of Android. There’s no official announcement just yet, but it’s safe to say that there is testing going on behind the scenes. The OnePlus 1 getting the update would be interesting, as it would signal a shift away from CyanogenMod for the device. It would also be interesting for the OnePlus X, which still has yet to switch over to Marshmallow, although there is a preview build available. Sony devices and Android 7.0 Nougat Sony tells Digital Trends that the following devices will be updated to Android 7.0 Nougat: Sony Xperia Z3+ Sony Xperia Z4 Tablet Sony Xperia Z5 Sony Xperia Z5 Compact Sony Xperia Z5 Premium Sony Xperia X Sony Xperia XA Sony Xperia XA Ultra Sony Xperia X Performance That’s a solid number of devices that are making the jump to Nougat, but that’s also because the company always produces a slew of devices every year. There’s no time frame, but the company says it’s working to “bring this major update to as many of our devices as possible.” There’s some controversy surrounding Sony — the Xperia Z3 had a preview for Android Nougat, but it isn’t getting the final version for some reason. It seems as though the Z3 only served as a test bed for Google’s new operating system. BlackBerry devices and Android 7.0 Nougat Expected devices to jump to Nougat for BlackBerry are: BlackBerry Priv BlackBerry DTEK50 BlackBerry only has two Android smartphones: The Priv received Android 6.0 Marshmallow in April — nearly 6 months after the OS was launched; and the latest DTEK50 sports Marshmallow out the box. Both devices should upgrade to Android 7.0 Nougat. BlackBerry tells Digital Trends that the company has Nougat and is working to add “our BlackBerry security.” No timeline was offered. Alcatel devices and Android 7.0 Nougat Alcatel is one of those companies that announces an incredible number of devices, and it’s often hard to keep track of what’s actually available. Still, there are three devices that should get the Nougat update, and two of them recently launched with Marshmallow: Alcatel Idol 4S Alcatel Idol 4 Alcatel OneTouch Idol 3 The Idol 4 is only available on Cricket Wireless, so you’ll have to wait and see if Cricket is even interested in issuing an update. We previously asked Alcatel executives when the Idol 4S would receive Nougat and they said an update would come when the company deemed the Nougat release to be stable. The Idol 3 only received Marshmallow in June. We have reached out to Alcatel for confirmation and will update this post when we hear back. Huawei devices and Android 7.0 Nougat Huawei has confirmed with Digital Trends that apart from the Nexus 6P, which was manufactured by Huawei, the only other confirmed device to get Nougat is the Mate 8. Other devices, especially those under the Honor brand, should also receive the update, but it’s unconfirmed: Huawei Mate 8 Huawei Mate S Huawei Honor 5X Huawei Honor 5C Huawei Honor GX8 (G8) Huawei Honor V8 Huawei Honor 7 Huawei P9 Huawei P9 Lite Huawei P8 Lite Huawei P8 Most of these devices aren’t available in the U.S., but only in select markets. A Huawei Customer Acquisition Manager, Taylor Wimberly, said the company is making a commitment to provide its Honor customers access to new features “at least once every 3 months during the first 12 months” for up to 24 months after a product’s launch. “We will keep providing access to security and software updates to fix bugs and enhance user experience in a timely manner,” Wimberly said. “Beyond this period we will continue to provide updates in response to any threats to user safety and security. Our goal is to ensure customers have the best and safest possible experience on their Honor device.” There’s also no timeline available for when any updates will roll out, but the Honor 5X just got the Marshmallow update in June so don’t expect something anytime soon. Asus devices and Android 7.0 Nougat The following devices from Asus should receive the Nougat update: Asus ZenFone 3 Laser Asus ZenFone 3 Max Asus ZenFone 3 Asus ZenFone 3 Deluxe Asus ZenFone 3 Ultra Asus ZenFone Zoom Asus ZenFone 2 Asus ZenFone 2 Laser Asus ZenFone Selfie Most of these devices are only available in select markets. Most of the aforementioned devices received the Marshmallow update within the past few months, so it may take Asus a while to move to Nougat. The company did not respond to our request to clarify which devices will make the jump to Nougat.

If you’re a publisher or webmaster that likes to bombard users with intrusive ads, however, then you might want to look away. In an effort to “improve the mobile search experience,” Google has announced today that it will soon begin penalizing sites in Google Search when it finds that the ads (or, more broadly, the interstitials) they serve users are too intrusive… If you know you’re guilty of this (and by “this” I mean ruining just about everyone’s experience on the mobile web), Google says that you have until January 10, 2017 to set things straight until you start getting a dock in rank: Pages that show intrusive interstitials provide a poorer experience to users than other pages where content is immediately accessible. This can be problematic on mobile devices where screens are often smaller. To improve the mobile search experience, after January 10, 2017, pages where content is not easily accessible to a user on the transition from the mobile search results may not rank as highly. The company provided three examples of interstitials that it would consider intrusive, in case you’re unclear: “a popup that covers the main content,” “a standalone interstitial that the user has to dismiss,” and “a layout where the above-the-fold portion of the page appears similar to a standalone interstitial, but the original content has been inlined underneath the fold.” In much more minor news, Google also announced today that mobile-friendly label in search results, the little helper is being retired. Google says that this is to “keep search results uncluttered,” as well as the fact that “85% of all pages in the mobile search results” now meet the criteria of being mobile-friendly.

Follow TechnoBuffalo Just as it did with the launch of YouTube Red, Google is recruiting some of YouTube’s biggest stars to create content for the launch of Daydream, according to Bloomberg. The search giant is reportedly spending hundreds of thousands of dollars on VR films and programs, tapping stars such as iJustine and the Dolan twins to help create content ahead of Daydream’s launch, which is reportedly “in the coming weeks.” As part of Daydream’s launch, Google has also partnered with a number of big players to help drive adoption of the new platform. During its Google I/O presentation in May, Google revealed Hulu, Ubisoft, the NBA, and IMAX will all have a presence on Daydream when it launches. Google has reportedly spent “six figures on video games,” too, Bloomberg said. YouTube already supports 360-degree video, so Daydream users won’t be without content to watch. However, by tapping some of the industry’s top creators to make content for Daydream’s launch, Google is ensuring the platform is filled with new—and presumably exclusive—stuff to keep users busy. Bloomberg claims “dozens” of filmmakers have signed on to work with YouTube ahead of Daydream’s launch. Now that Android 7.0 Nougat is available, a key component of Daydream is already in the wild. Up next, Google will need to get Daydream-ready phones out to consumers, likely led by the release of its rumored Nexus devices, Marlin and Sailfish. Some of the manufacturers expected to make Daydream-ready phones include Samsung, Huawei, LG, and Xiaomi. You can read more about the Daydream VR platform from our coverage from earlier this year.

Over the next several weeks, the Nexus 6, Nexus 5X, Nexus 6P, Nexus 9, Nexus Player, Pixel C and General Mobile 4G (Android One) will get an over-the-air software update to Android 7.0 Nougat. Any devices enrolled in the Android Beta Program will also receive this final version, Google said. Sameer Samat, VP of Product Management, Android & Google Play, said, “Google has taken a different approach to build and launch Nougat which was announced earlier this year. For starters, we invited developers to take a sneak peek at Android N back in March, so they could bring their apps to the new platform earlier. There are over 250 major features in Android Nougat.” But, experts and bloggers who write on tech say that the average person would not be able to get it till the end or the beginning of 2017. Anand Parthasarathy, who runs the techblog Indiatech Online, said, “Now is not the time to get excited. It will be a while before non-Nexus phone buyers will be able to experience the Android 7.0 Nougat. As Nexus is from Google itself, the phones will get updates faster. We Indians will get to see phones with the software in not less than 60 to 90 days. That could well spill onto next year.” O P E N Coupon Flipkart Shopclues eBay Mobile Prices Samsung Mobile Prices Micromax Mobile Prices Apple Mobile Latest Navjot Kaur, Pargat to join Congress on Nov 28: Amarinder Pakistan DGMO called up: but border heading for spiralling violence End in House logjam after Bhartruhari Mahtab’s suggestion?

Home Mail Flickr Tumblr News Sports Finance Celebrity Answers Groups Mobile More Yahoo Search Search 0 Mail Tech Home Follow Us Reviews How To Deals Video Games Pogue Apple The latest change in Google’s Chrome browser is infuriating, but we’ll show you how to undo it Zach Epstein BGR NewsAugust 23, 2016 Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share Google's Chrome web browser is a resource hog. Because of that, it's also often a battery hog. It doesn't have a few of the cool new features rival browsers have such as built-in free VPN, and it doesn't look quite as sleek as other options out there like Safari. But Chrome is lightning-fast and its user interface is slick and minimalistic. It also offers fantastic tie-ins with other Google services and a catalog of third-party extensions that no other browser can touch. Those are just some of the reasons it's the most popular web browser in the world, and why I have no plans to switch away from it despite the fact that one of Google's changes in the latest Chrome update is driving me insane. DON'T MISS: 5 best new features in Android 7.0 Nougat According to Google, 0.04% of page views served up by its Chrome web browser come as a result of users hitting the backspace key to go back one page. That number seems minuscule but if you stop to consider how many pages Chrome serves up, that number is much bigger than you might have thought. If you search around social networks like Facebook and Twitter, or around tech forums, you'll see that users have been outraged ever since Google eliminated the backspace-to-go-back feature in its latest major update, Chrome 52. But don't worry, undoing the damage is beyond easy. Google initially downplayed how widely the backspace key is used to go back a page, but the company saw the user outcry and was quick to respond. No, it didn't add the functionality back to Chrome, but it did do the next best thing: Google released an official Chrome extension that re-maps the backspace key to its old function. Google's "Go Back With Backspace" extension is completely free and available for download in the Chrome Web Store.

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Google Allo features incognito chats, private notifications, and expiring messages [UPDATE] By R Padla - August 23, 2016 16 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter Google has rolled out yet another chat app in Allo. This instant messaging program is different from the Duo video chat which is also separate from Hangouts. Google said that the latter is more for desktop and corporate while Allo is for mobile. We’re curious if the Allo and Duo will be set as default on Android 7.0 but I guess we’ll know for sure once the first Nougat phone becomes available. UPDATE: The previous version of the text erroneously said that Google Allo is now available. While the app is listed on Google Play Store, it is still in a private testing stage and is only accepting pre-registers. We apologize for the confusion it has caused. The Google Allo app is now listed on the Play Store but is ONLY accepting pre-registers. The tech giant describes this app as one the can make conversations easier, more expressive, and more productive than ever. It’s not just for random mobile communications but it can also be used for work and other projects that need a more efficient way to connect. We’ve featured the Google Allo before but haven’t really tackled its more significant features. For one, this Allo features an Incognito Mode so you can chat privately with anyone. This means conversations are protected with end-to-end encryption. Chats can also be hidden from those prying eyes as you can use private notifications only you can know. The app also features a new Incognito Mode. Making this more private and secure is Signal. The Google devs also made sure that chats in Incognito Mode will remain private yet identifiable with their choice of icon, dark blue grey background, and private notifications. Such messages will not include a preview of recent messages. You will only see those who sent the last message. Another good thing about this Incognito mode is that Allo deletes the message after some time. Just like Snapchat, incognito messages an expiry time. Another important thing to remember includes the inability to take screenshots of Incognito conversations. A small timer will also be placed on top of a conversation. It’s up to you how you will use it or set an alarm. You can also have different settings for each incognito conversation for quicker access. Check out Google Allo on the Google Play Store and sign-up to pre-register.

Fiji Time: 5:59 AM on Thursday 24 November Home Politics Local Sport World Letters Editorial Nai Lalakai Business Features Classifieds Weather Gallery Archives / Front page / News No.1 of 87 Ropate Valemei Wednesday, August 24, 2016 + Enlarge this image Ben Ryan, left, and members of the victorious Fiji 7s team wave to the crowd during the victory celebrations at the ANZ Stadium in Suva on Monday. Picture: JONA LALAKOBAU FIJI would rank number one in the world if the achievements of all countries at the Rio 2016 Summer Olympic Games were ranked by gross domestic product (GDP). This was revealed by Google Inc on its website yesterday. The United States of America is in second place, followed by Jamaica and then Great Britain in third and fourth places respectively. GDP is the annual total value of goods produced and services provided by a country. It is the size of a country's economic output, traditionally used to show how large an economy is. Fiji's GDP is below $10 billion as of this year with GDP per capita of about $US5000 ($F10, 377) recorded in 2015. Google considered all medal tallies and adjusted them by a number of factors such as population size, team size, GDP and others to really explore how rankings would look like if the playing field was level. Fiji ranked 54 out of 87 with one gold medal alongside Jordan, Kosovo, Tajikistan, Puerto Rico and Singapore. If the world population was equal, Google noted Fiji would rank 22 out of 87. Once GDP is taken into account, Fiji would rank 1 out of 87 in the world. According to Simon Rogers — a data journalist and data editor at Google's News Lab — this experiment was based on an exercise he took part in for London's 2012 games with statistician Christoforos Anagnostopoulos, then of London's Imperial College. In 2012, he used data on population, GDP and team size to model what would happen if all the teams had equal resources. "We wanted to show how small countries can really punch above their weight when it comes to being the best in sport," Mr Rogers said. "For 2016, I got to work with Anagnostopoulos again, who is now co-founder of Mentat. "And this time we wanted to look at a whole new set of data. "We wanted to see which teams in 2016 were beating the average to overperform against a whole new set of variables, including how people search on Google." Minister for Youth and Sports Laisenia Tuitubou said he could only comment on Fiji's 54th ranking at the Olympics but referred the GDP to the Minister for Economy and the Reserve Bank of Fiji. The Minister for Economy and Attorney-General, Aiyaz Sayed-Khaiyum, could not be reached for comment because he was out of the country while efforts to obtain comments from the RBF yesterday remained futile when this issue went to press last night.

CONTENT Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide POPULAR TOPICS Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Popular Topics  Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Twitter Google+ Facebook Youtube RSS Search SlashGear Search Google Search will penalize sites that use interstitial ads next year Eric Abent - Aug 23, 2016 1 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Advertisements on the internet can range in annoyance, with intrusive interstitial ads that pop-up over text being among the most frustrating. Google is gearing up to take a harder line against sites that show these kinds of ads early next year, and it’s doing so as a way of making content easier to access on mobile. While those pop-up interstitial ads are frustrating no matter where you encounter them, they can be downright demonic on mobile, as tapping the little red X to dismiss the ad can become rage-inducing exercise on a smaller screen. Starting on January 10, 2017, Google Search will begin to penalize sites that employ these ads and make accessing content from search results more difficult to mobile users. However, not all interstitial pop-ups are created equally, and Google seems to recognize this. Instead of showing ads, interstitials can be used to inform incoming users of a site’s cookie policy or show an age gate to add another layer between users and adult content. Google says it won’t penalize sites that use these types of interstitials, nor will it punish sites that employ banner ads that only take up a “reasonable” portion of the screen on mobile. With that in mind, if a site uses a pop that appears at the beginning of an article or after the user has scrolled a certain length down the page, hiding the text underneath, Google considers that a no-no and may begin penalizing the offending sites in search results. It’s important to keep in mind that consideration for interstitial ads is just one signal Google uses to determine the search ranking of a page, so using these ads isn’t a guarantee that search ranking will plummet. Google also took this opportunity to announce that it will be removing the “mobile-friendly” tag from search results. The tag was rolled out two years ago in an effort to let searchers know when a site offered a page that was easily readable on mobile, but since it has recently found that 85% of sites now qualify for the “mobile-friendly” label, it will be removing it in order to keep search results free of clutter. So, there are significant changes coming to Google Search. We’ll see if this has any noticeable effect on the number of interstitial and pop up ads, but regardless of the results, it’s nice to see Google focusing on them. Stay tuned.

Microsoft announced on Aug. 22 that it is acquiring Genee, an artificial intelligence and virtual assistant technology startup from Mountain View, Calif., for an undisclosed amount. Genee's technology will be used to enhance Office 365's scheduling and meetings management capabilities, Rajesh Jha, corporate vice president of Microsoft Outlook and Office 365, said in an Aug. 22 announcement. Dovetailing with Microsoft's "Conversations as a Platform" vision, Genee enables business professionals to set reminders and carve out time for meetings, calls, dinners and other events in their calendars in much the same way a personal assistant would. Google will end support for Chrome applications on Windows, Linux and Mac platforms over the next two years. Starting in early 2018, users of packaged and hosted Chrome apps will no longer be able to run them on these platforms. Google will, however, continue to support all types of Chrome apps on Chrome OS for the foreseeable future, a company executive announced Aug. 19. In a blog post, Google Vice President of Product Management Rahul Roy-Chowdhury said the decision was prompted by the fact that many of the capabilities offered by Google apps are now available natively in popular browsers. At Intel Developer Forum 2016 Aug. 16-18, the chip maker made it clear it wants to be the provider of the basic technologies for the internet of things. As part of the effort, Intel officials at the show announced an expanded partnership with AT&T, which will adopt Intel technology as it builds out its software-centric network. The two companies already partner in a number of areas, including 5G networks and drones, and now Intel products will be used in the carrier's high-profile project to use technologies like software-defined networking and network-functions virtualization to make their networks more flexible and scalable. By leveraging Intel's Xeon server chips, AT&T is hoping to take the various networking tasks that traditionally have run on specialized and expensive hardware and put them into software that can run on standard x86-based systems. AT&T, Alphabet, Apple and 30 other technology and communications companies have joined the Federal Communications Commission in an effort to eliminate robocalls. Described as "a scourge" by the FCC, those irritating, automated, prerecorded calls are the No. 1 consumer complaint to the FCC. Members of a newly formed Robocall Strike Force, led by AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson, met for the first time Aug. 19. "What we're going to have to do is come out of this meeting with a comprehensive playbook that we all go out and begin to execute," Stephenson told the assembled members Friday. They included carriers, device makers, OS developers, network designers, regulators and lawmakers.       Submit a Comment Loading Comments...   Manage your Newsletters: Login   Register My Newsletters eWeek Editor's Pick News & Views Cloud Computing Mobile and Wireless Update Best of eWeek eWeek Sunday Brunch eCareers Smart Moves Enterprise Applications Topic Center Update Enterprise IT Advantage eWeek Whitepaper Spotlight eWeek Labs eWeek Enterprise Update eWeek Storage Report Industry Center Update : Finance Industry Center Update : Government Industry Center Update : Health Care Infrastructure Topic Center Update Linux & Open Source Topic Center Update Mid-Market Solutions Securing the Enterprise VoIP Topic Center Update What's Hot Now eWeekend         News and Reviews Slideshows IBM Aims Watson at Embodied Cognition Microsoft Advances 'Any Developer, Any App, Any Platform' Strategy Google Will Tag Frequent Violators of Its Site Safety Standards Intel Lights Up the Sky With New Shooting Star Drone Old School Polling Methods Hid Trump's Popularity With Voters 10 Reasons Not to Buy the Apple MacBo...

901-421-5480 info@unofficial.cc Facebook Twitter Facebook Twitter HOME ABOUT BLOG CONTACT Select Page What You Need to Know About Search Engine Optimization What is search engine optimization? A major part of the internet today depends on what we search for on search engines and the results we get, but are those results based on something? They absolutely are. The search engines, be it Yahoo, Google or Bing, work on algorithms which pick up on specific words on the web pages matching your search terms. For example, if you search Website Design on Google, the webpage that has the most relevant website design information on it will show up on top. With time, search engines have been upgraded and made smarter to avoid search results which use questionable search engine optimization methods. This is done to provide users with an authentic and comfortable use of the internet as they are searching for what is required. Search Engine Optimization Explained Let’s take an example of a grocery store clerk, but this isn’t just a regular grocery store. This grocery store houses every product for sale in the world. With such an enormous inventory, the clerk needs to know what every product is and how it is related to other products, so that customers can choose what they think is best for them. To have all that information processed and give out the best result possible, you need to have a system. This system, in the case of the internet, is the search engine. Google and Bing are the store clerks that recommend us the best products based on our inquiry. Search engines use algorithms to go through every webpage in the world and give you the most relevant ones in descending order. The one that it thinks is the most relevant shows up on top. For people who own websites, search results matter as people on search engines tend to only go through the first five search results to find what they need. With higher rankings, your website can be accessed by more people as it shows up on top in the search results. To achieve that, your web pages have to contain everything that is required by the algorithm to pick it up first. This is search engine optimization. Most of the common algorithms work on the following details: Words or groups of words Titles Links Ratings N Words Search engines tend to pick up on the words that you have used in their search bar and go through web pages that have similar words written in them. When making content for web pages, it is important to use words that are relevant to your page and will be searched for, the most, by a user. N Links If there are a lot of websites linking to your site for reference, it is possible that you will get a higher search rating.  However, search engines have become smarter when it comes to people using bogus and bought links to their websites. In this case, the search engine will discard the website from the results. N Titles There are hidden titles to web pages that are somewhere in the coding. Search engines use those titles to see if the page is relevant to the search or not. N Ratings The more people that approve of your page with a like button or an online review, the higher your rating will be and higher rated pages show up over other lower rated pages.

Image Credit: Getty Images Google seems to be testing a super convenient new feature By Aric Suber-Jenkins August 23, 2016 SHARE TWEET PIN Google is searching for new ways to simplify our lives: The tech giant appears to have quietly rolled out a feature that lists nearby businesses within a user's vicinity, 9to5Google reported. It's unclear if this technique works for everyone at this time of writing, but if you search "**" (drop the quotation marks), various neighboring businesses will show up. For example, I live in Brooklyn, and when I enter two asterisks into Google's search bar, the following results appear: Search results from Google Source: Mic/Google Everything from restaurants to gyms, academic institutions, banks, museums and fast food joints appear on the first page of my search. Each of these businesses are based in Brooklyn, but some of these locations are several miles away from me. That's not exactly walking distance, so it's hard to determine what exact measurements Google uses to compile this list. The double asterisk is not in Google's official list of search operators, so it's possible that Google is still in the testing phase of this new feature. A single asterisk, while usable in conjunction with other search terms, returns zero results on its own. Interestingly enough, three, four and five asterisks also bring up local businesses — some different, others the same as the double asterisk — but when I enter six or more stars, Google returns zero results.

Thank you for supporting the partners who make SitePoint possible. More from this author How Can Your Site Get into Google Answer Boxes? Retargeting: SEO & PPC Working Together Keyword Research: Finding Local Intent When the topic of off page SEO comes up, more often than not people are talking about link building. And with good reason. Building a backlink profile of quality links is one of the most important parts of SEO. However, off page SEO is more than just link building. There are several optimizations that take place off-page that contribute to your site’s trust, authority and ranking in search results, as well as driving traffic. In this piece we’ll go over a few ways you can shape your site’s off page factors to manage its appearance in search results, and ultimately increase its rank — all without building a single new link. Google Knowledge Graph The Knowledge graph is Google’s attempt to enhance search results using semantic search information gathered from the web. In other words, it’s Google’s way of figuring out what you’re searching for and providing that information directly in its SERP. For branded keywords, the Knowledge Graph is like a giant billboard in Google’s search results. Getting your business or personal brand to appear in the Knowledge Graph is a way to jump right to the front page. Some marketers dislike the Knowledge Graph because it sometimes links to other people’s content and can lead to searchers bypassing your site, but it appears for branded keywords whether you want it to or not. In this case you can’t beat them, so you may as well join them. Plus, in the end, if you do a good job optimizing your off page SEO, the benefits will outweigh the disadvantages. So how do you make sure the Knowledge Graph for your brand is being displayed, and how do you optimize your content for it? Google+ The first step is to create a Google+ page for your business and pick a business type that best suits yours. When you create your page, use the brand name that people use when searching for you. So, for example, Recreational Equipment, Inc. would use the name REI when creating its Google+ page. If you aren’t sure, check in Google Search Console or Analytics reporting to see which keywords generate the most impressions. The stronger your Google+ presence, the more likely it is that Google with serve a Knowledge Graph rich snippet and include your feed in it. Keep your profile active by posting regularly and periodically run campaigns to generate +1s on your content. This will have the added benefit of telling Google what your brand is about, which will help to optimize the content in the rich snippet. Wikipedia Wikipedia and Wikidata are probably the two most important non-Google sources for Knowledge Graphs, especially since Google migrated from Freebase. Google relies heavily on the data from Wikipedia to populate certain parts of the Knowledge Graph such as company type, description and details. Being listed on the Wikipedia family of sites, particularly the two mentioned above, gives Google a strong hint to show this information in a Knowledge Graph when a user searches for your brand. If your company or personal brand doesn’t already have an entry on Wikidata, create one now. Include the following information: Label: This is your brand’s name (or your name if it’s a personal brand). Like your Google+ page, use the name people search for. Description: Small bits of information used to differentiate items with identical or very similar labels. We use ‘small bits’ of information because you shouldn’t use full sentences, just a few words. For WooRank this would be something like “Digital Marketing Services” or “Search Engine Optimization Tools”. Follow Wikidata’s description guidelines pertaining to punctuation and grammar. Official website: Put your canonical URL here. That means anyone linked to your site shouldn’t go through any redirects. Freebase ID: If you have a Freebase profile, add the Freebase ID at the bottom of the Wikidata entry. Even though Google deprecated the Freebase database, it still helps to connect your entries. If your company doesn’t already have a Wikipedia page, request one to be created. Getting your page accepted to Wikipedia can be difficult, especially when it comes to creating a page for your company, so be sure to follow their guidelines. Read through their Organizations FAQ section for more details on creating an article and disclosing a conflict of interest. Google My Business Listing Google leverages its My Business listings heavily to get information for the Knowledge Graph and it’s a great way to get your name, address and phone number (NAP) into search results. This is particularly important if you’re a local business or rely on local SEO. In fact, having your correct NAP listed online is one of the strongest ranking signals for local search. Do your best to generate some reviews as well, since the Knowledge Graph can include a review summary for local businesses. YouTube If your company generates any multimedia content, add it to YouTube. This is particularly important for musicians or anyone else who produces videos as a revenue stream. Google relies on YouTube information to find and display data about songs and other video content. A search for Taylor Swift, for example, lists three of her most popular songs. Clicking these links brings users to the Google carousel, which displays YouTube videos posted to her official YouTube channel. Social Media Social media and SEO is a bit of a murky subject. Google has explicitly stated that social factors, like Facebook likes and Twitter followers, don’t play a role as ranking signals. So no matter how popular you get on social media, unfortunately, it won’t lead directly to higher search rankings, and links from your social media profiles back to your site won’t pass link juice. There are ways, however, that social media will impact on your SEO efforts. 1. Search engines crawl social media pages. As we mentioned previously, posting links to your page on Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and other social media sites is a way to get spiders to find, crawl and index your new website. If you’ve got a Pinterest account, include your URL in the descriptions of your pins. 2. Search engines index social media pages. If you search for WooRank, our Twitter and LinkedIn pages show up third and fourth in the results. This is important because it helps keep users within your ecosystem, allowing you to move them through the conversion funnel. 3. Google has integrated Twitter feeds into its SERPs. It now displays Tweets in a carousel in its search results for branded keywords. This is true for both people and companies. They’re served just below the news results, right at the top of the page. Like the Knowledge Graph, your tweets will allow you to jump to the top of the page for branded keywords. 4. Other search engines use social authority as a ranking signal. Just because Google doesn’t take social signals into account when determining ranking doesn’t mean it’s the same rule used by everyone. In fact, back in 2010 Bing told Danny Sullivan at Search Engine Land that they do, in fact, determine the social authority of a user and use that to influence search results. Yes, “search engine” is often just another word for Google when talking about SEO, but spending a little time on your social media presence to boost your rankings in the world’s second largest search engine will help you in the long run. Plus, you never know when Google will start to use social signals for rankings. Document Sharing If you’ve got documents that Google can’t easily crawl, like a PowerPoint slideshow or a PDF, consider posting it to a document sharing site like SlideShare. Approach this content like you would any other content that you’d publish on your site: Start with keyword research to decide which you want to target and then optimize on page elements for those keywords. These elements include: Filename: Use a keyword-rich filename for your presentation and follow best practices such as using only lowercase letters and avoiding underscores between words. Title tags: Optimize your SlideShare title tags as you would for SEO. Make it between 50-60 characters long and include your relevant keyword. Meta description: Again, follow SEO practices for your descriptions — keep it under 155 characters, include your keywords, make it specific and include action-oriented language. Note that SlideShare gives you way more than the recommended description length, so count your characters. Transcripts: Search engines can’t crawl slideshows, so they won’t find any keywords you use in the text. However, SlideShare transcribes your slideshow and puts it on the page, so make your presentation keyword rich. Using effective calls to action that point back to your site will then allow you to take advantage of SlideShare’s ranking power. Links to your site may be nofollow, in which case you won’t get link juice, but you’ll still get your content to rank at the top of search results, earning it a huge audience. You can then use calls to action to get users to your landing pages and convert them there. Citations, Web Directories, Business Reviews & Comments Citations are listings of your business’ name and address on external web pages, normally a local business directory like a chamber of commerce or community group website. Make sure your NAP is consistent across all local citations, since consistent and correct NAP information is the most important local ranking signal. Conversely, incorrect or inconsistent NAP is the strongest negative ranking factor. Spending time making sure all your listings are correct is a tedious process, but it’s very important. Web directories used to be a common practice for SEOs looking to generate some easy backlinks. Unfortunately, this resulted in a lot of low quality, spammy directories that provided little to no value to users. However, if you submit your URL to quality directories like Best of the Web or Alltop, you’ll make it easier for search engines to find and crawl your pages. While reviews are most often discussed as a part of local SEO, they’re an important element of off page SEO for any business. Positive business reviews instill positive brand awareness and trust, act as a citation for your business and help in conversion. In fact, 80% of customers trust online reviews as much as a personal recommendation (although they are concerned about fake reviews). Like with document sharing sites, putting your business on highly ranked review sites like Yelp will help get your name at the top of search rankings for keywords you would normally not necessarily compete or optimize for. Sometimes called blog marketing or forum marketing, leaving comments on blogs, forums and question-and-answer sites is another old school SEO trick that, while not as effective as it once was, can still be used to your benefit. Most forums and blog comment sections automatically make all links nofollow links, but that doesn’t mean they don’t have any value. If you’re participating in a discussion in a way that adds value or answers a question, you’ll build your reputation as someone knowledgeable in your niche. Plus, if you’re sticking to high-quality blogs and forums, Google will learn to associate your business with the right type of neighborhood which helps build up trust and authority. Conclusion So there you go: four off page SEO tactics that help you increase your rank and exposure without creating a single link. And the best part is that all of the elements we talked about are completely under your control, so there’s no need for buttering up bloggers or in-depth outreach campaigns. And even better, since off page SEO is as much about developing brand exposure, awareness and reputation, not only will you get more traffic, you should also see more qualified traffic as well. What off page SEO tactics do you use to build brand awareness and manage your online reputation? What’s worked? What challenges have you encountered?

Bloomberg has claimed that Google is "investing hundreds of thousands of dollars apiece in virtual-reality films and programs". It also plans to promote VR projects from Hulu, fund the production of 360-degree videos from YouTube stars like Justine Ezarik (iJustine), and it's partnered with video game producers and sports leagues, all with the purpose of launching Daydream with a lineup of exclusive VR content. Google has apparently spent a lot of money in recent months, because Daydream already faces stiff competition in the crowded VR headset space from likes of Facebook's Oculus Rift, Sony's PlayStation VR, Samsung's Gear VR, and HTC's Vive, among others. The company wants apps, shorts, and games to fill up a hybrid store in order to attract users, encourage growth, and create a highly engaging environment. Google is reportedly spending "high six figures on video games" and offering "low five figures to low six figures" for projects with filmmakers and online talent. Also, YouTube is slated to be one of dozens of apps available at launch, alongside HBO’s streaming service, Hulu, and apps from the NBA and MLB. Keep in mind the latest version of Android, called 7.0 Nougat, began rolling out this week with support for Daydream. In fact, Android Nougat has VR-enhancing features including faster graphics processing and quicker head tracking. It's therefore only matter of time before Google gives its new mobile VR platform a proper launch. Bloomberg said Daydream will even be introduced simultaneously with new Android phones, VR headsets, and controllers. Google has only developed reference designs for headsets and controllers, though. The plan is that other companies will build their own VR devices, such as smartphones, which can run Daydream. We still don't know much about the mobile VR platform, including what Google is demanding of hardware partners, as we've only seen a concept of a prototype headset design and have heard that Daydream phones will require key components like specific sensors and screens. That said, we know Google has partnered with Samsung, LG, Xiaomi, and HTC on building Daydream-compatible phones that would work with Daydream headsets to serve up a mobile VR experience.

Virtual Reality Platform Service For Androids Slated To Launch For Fall 2016 By Alexandra Suarez On 08/23/16 AT 3:30 PM Close Google’s new virtual reality platform service is poised to hit the market soon. The tech giant recently announced that it would be debuting its Google Daydream service as soon as this fall. Google has invested hundreds of thousands of dollars in virtual reality films and services, according to the Financial Post. The plan is to set up a timeline for exclusive content for the launch of Google Daydream, which could hit in a matter of weeks. So what exactly is Google Daydream? This past May, Google had already announced that it would be launching a series of games and programs for Daydream when it was first revealed at Google I/O in Calif. Daydream is Google’s answer to incorporating a virtual reality platform into its Android mobile system. The Verge reported that a majority of Google’s partners for the VR platform have already committed to creating mobile phones that will be compatible with Daydream.

Bloomberg revealed that investments had been made towards 360-degree videos and short films in addition to the requisite VR video games. A Bloomberg reporter, Lucas Shaw, also revealed that the applications of the service had the potential to extend VR capabilities into real estate or retail. Google has partnered with a number of major companies and brands to ensure the virtual reality experience isn’t short of anything awe-inspiring. Bloomberg confirmed that Hulu will be launching in partnership with the company, as well as YouTube, Netflix and HBO, among others. At I/O, Google also announced that outlets like the Wall Street Journal, New York Times and CNN would partner for launch. YouTube stars like Justine Ezarik and the Dolan Twins will be part of the virtual experience as well, TechCrunch reported. The tech site also reported that Daydream will most likely be launching to coincide with the launch of the new Android phones. The headsets and controllers are sure to follow.

RSS ALL ARTICLES FEATURES ONLY   TRIVIA Search How-To Geek How to Skip the Wait and Upgrade Your Nexus to Android Nougat Now Android Nougat is here, but it’s rolling out to Nexus devices slowly. If you still haven’t gotten the upgrade notification, here’s a little trick to upgrade sooner. RELATED ARTICLES The Best New Features in Android 7.0 “Nougat” Four Excellent Android Nougat Improvements You May Not Know About My Nexus 5X hadn’t gotten the update notification today, but after performing these simple steps, I’m up and running Android 7.0 with no hassle. You don’t even need an unlocked bootloader. It turns out, users enrolled in the Android Beta program are getting priority with this update. If you aren’t in the beta program, though, you can enroll now–and if the update has started to roll out for your device, you’ll get the final version of Nougat right away. When it’s done installing, you can just unenroll from the beta program without any consequences. (Hat tip to -TheReal- on Reddit and @jmcountryman on Twitter for pointing this out!) This only works for Nexus devices that are currently slated to get the update, which means Nexus 6, Nexus 5X, Nexus 6P, and Nexus 9, as well as the Nexus Player, Pixel C and General Mobile 4G. In addition, it won’t work just yet for some devices–Google has started rolling out to the 6P, 5X, and Pixel C first, and this trick should work right away. Nexus 6 and 9 users are reporting that it isn’t working yet, but once Google starts that rollout, it should work there too. Step One: Enroll in the Android Beta Program This could not be simpler. First, head to this page in a web browser. If you’re logged into your Google account, you should see eligible devices in a list further down the page. Just click the “Enroll Device” button to enroll in the beta. NOTE: The page claims your data will be wiped when you opt out, but as long as you’re downloading a final build and not a preview build, you’ll be fine–your device won’t be wiped. But it couldn’t hurt to make a backup of your important data first, just in case. Step Two: Download and Install the Update You should soon see an update notification on your phone (mine came almost immediately). Tap it, and you’ll get more information about the update.   If you see the screen on the left, that means Google is serving a final release for your device, and you can tap the Download button to continue. If you see the screen on the right, however–which notes that the update is a preview build–do not tap the Download button. The final version isn’t rolling out to your model yet, so try again later. Give your phone time to download and install the update, and soon you should be running Android Nougat, fresh from Google’s official update mechanism. Step Three: Unenroll in the Beta Program Now that you have the update, head back to the beta enrollment page and click the “Unenroll Device” button for your phone. Now that you have the update, you don’t need the beta program anymore (unless you want to keep it). Again, the page warns that your device will be wiped, but as long as you installed a final build and not a preview build, your device should be fine. That’s it! Enjoy all the new features of Android Nougat, and go brag to all your friends that you got the update first. JOIN THE DISCUSSION (21 REPLIES) August 23, 2016 Thomas Aranda I have a Nexus 5X but it says I have no eligible devices... August 23, 2016 Awesome tip! Enrolled and got the notification on my Nexus 5X instantly! August 23, 2016 Gordon Hay Thanks guys, this worked perfectly. Got the update available notification as soon as I clicked the enrol button and the unenrol afterwards also worked without any issues. Now to explore... August 23, 2016 Koam Nice idea, but it didn't work for me. I have a Nexus 6 on Marshmallow, Stock Android, not rooted. bootloader unlocked. I enrolled in the BetaImmediately got a notification for the upgrade.It is the Beta Preview, not the full version of Nougat. Nexus 6 is definitely going to get Nougat from Google. So this article's shortcut did not work yet. August 23, 2016 Koam Tried a second time and even a third time to enroll and again it gave me the Preview version screen. This isn't working. Nexus 6 on M. Each time I enrolled in the Beta and unenrolled after receiving the Preview (NPD90G) rather than the full version of N. August 24, 2016 Ymyname I followed your instructions to the "T" I got the 7.0 update. I still couldn't play the Easter egg, and the new launcher I heard about I don't see it?? Can it be that this is still the beta version? I also tried to unenrolled to go back to 6.1 and couldn't so... Can you help? August 24, 2016 Koam @Ymyname How do I verify that I’m running a beta version of Android?There are two ways to do this: Navigate to Settings > About > Build number. If the build number starts with NP, you are running a beta version of Android N.Reboot your device. You will see a message informing you that your device is running a beta version of Android. August 24, 2016 Whitson Gordon Yes, I addressed this in the article. It's not out at all for the Nexus 6 yet. From the article: In addition, it won’t work just yet for some devices–Google has started rolling out to the 6P, 5X, and Pixel C first, and this trick should work right away. Nexus 6 and 9 users are reporting that it isn’t working yet, but once Google starts that rollout, it should work there too. We're hoping it'll start rolling out sometime this week, but can't say for sure. August 24, 2016 Take a minute to read the article thoroughly. I, too, own the beast that is N6, and the article explains that this enroll/unenroll trick will only work if the final build is available for your phone - which isn't the case for you and me. It even warns NOT to install if you see the beta download screen. Of course you can do it anyway (like I did last night), stay enrolled till you get the update to stable version, then opt out - and you should be fine. Hope this helps. August 24, 2016 Silviu Stroe I followed the steps on my nexus 6P, got immediately the update, downloaded it and it started to verify the package. Afterwards the phone booted showing the Android mascot and beneath it just said "Error" . After a couple of seconds the phone restarted and I was back to version 6.0.1 and the update was not available anymore. August 24, 2016 Worked for me on my Project Fi Nexus 5X. Thanks "HowtoGeek"!It took a while to download the full build, but it just verified and rebooted to start the install.Can't wait to play with that delicious Nougat! August 25, 2016 Andrea Gatley Nexus 6p here. Downloading as I type this (Android 7.0, not the beta). Worked like a charm. August 25, 2016 User-1 Whats the word on the Nexus 5 and the Nexus 7? August 25, 2016 Kamaldeep Singh Hey! I want to ask out of box question. Windows 10 ISO file for all devices is same. In the same way, Is Android Version files e.g. marshmallow files are same for all devices? Can I just download and install marshmallow file on any android phone. August 25, 2016 Koam Nexus 5 is not getting an official push. There are workarounds out there but you have to DIY. I have a Nexus 7 2012 and it doesn't even work with the version they pushed to it a long time ago. I had to roll back to an earlier version of Android to keep it alive. Dunno about later models. I think this article lists the models that will get an official version of N August 25, 2016 Koam No. Don't try it. Each build is for a specific model. August 26, 2016 User-1 Seems kinda odd that Nexus 5 won't officially get the upgrade. I'll wait and see how things work out. I should have mentioned what Nexus 7 I was asking about. Personally I have a 2013 Internet? Hopefully that is the correct way to state this one. It was upgraded to 6 and runs no problem. Guess I'll wait for word on this one too. August 30, 2016 Peter Hubb Doesn't work for me either, it says that I have no eligible devices even though I have a nexus 5x. Yes, I am logged into my google account on the device. Also my Nexus 5X won't show up in the android device manager (where you can locate your device and let it ring and stuff) even though device manager is enabled in the settings. it are those typical annoying google-sided bugs which some people have and some don't where there is no solution.

The Android or iPhone handset in your pocket is a VR device in its own right too, especially when paired with a sub-£20 Google Cardboard headset that uses your phone as its screen and works with both Android and iOS. If you’re getting started with VR on your smartphone, here are 10 of the best apps to explore. They’re regular Android and iOS apps rather than ones requiring Samsung’s Gear VR mobile headset — that’s a separate roundup in its own right for the future. YouTube Android / iOS (Free) Starting with a really obvious one: YouTube is very keen on 360-degree videos and virtual reality, so there’s a rapidly-growing catalogue of these videos to watch on its service, from wildlife to music videos. “360” and “VR” are useful search terms to root out the best examples. Google Cardboard Android / iOS (Free) One of the first downloads for anyone with a Google Cardboard headset. This acts as an introduction to what’s available, from wraparound Google Earth to zipping over the Arctic. The app is also a decent listing of other Cardboard-compatible apps that are available: new ones are emerging every week. VRSE Android / iOS (Free) A growing number of documentary-makers are excited about VR’s potential to make us feel their movies. Vrse is an excellent place to start: it has music videos and fun shorts, but also more serious videos exploring our world. NYT VR Android / iOS (Free) Like the Guardian and companies like Vrse and RYOT, the New York Times is experimenting with virtual reality as a news format. Its app is a showcase for its VR reports, taking you from the depths of the ocean to the surface of Pluto, via the spire of 1 World Trade Center. Sisters: A Virtual Reality Ghost Story Android / iOS (Free) I can’t say much about Sisters without spoiling the plot, but this is an early — and frankly terrifying — glimpse at what virtual reality might be able to bring to the horror genre. It’s a short, scary experience that hints at plenty of potential. Just don’t play it late at night on your own. Orbulus Android / iOS (Free) Orbulus is evidence that one of the more convincing applications for VR is to give us a new perspective on real-world places we can’t visit in person. It’s a gallery of images created using Google’s Photo Sphere technology from some of the most famous tourist hotspots (and less-known scenes) across the world. Seene Android / iOS (Free) I could have chosen Google’s Cardboard Camera app as an example of shooting your own photos to be viewed in 360 degrees. Seene is even more interesting though, with the addition of features to easily share your 360-pics with the world. It’s fast and easy to use, with plenty of inspiration from its community. Jaunt VR Android / iOS (Free) Jaunt is comparable to Vrse in its mixture of entertaining videos and more serious short-films. There’s good variety here too, from live performances by Jack White and Paul McCartney to news events and an ABC News report from Syria. InCell VR Android / iOS (Free) Part game and part educational app, InCell VR is a spiffing-looking recreation of human cells, with the twist that you’re flying through them. The game part involves racing through the colourful environment outrunning a virus wave. It’s intense, but there’s science behind the fun. RYOT VR Android / iOS (Free) The Huffington Post liked the films of VR production firm RYOT so much, it bought the company earlier this year. RYOT has made a series of virtual-reality documentaries in far-flung places, with an emphasis on serious issues: riots, refugees, earthquake relief and other topics. For more on what RYOT is doing, read this interview with its co-founders. This is just skimming the surface of mobile VR in 2016, though: there are dozens more excellent apps to try. — Guardian News & Media Ltd, 2016 More from Technology UAE e-tailers slash prices to boost sales 04:32 pm UAE, Saudi Arabia top video consumption charts 03:42 pm Extradition of Russian hacker sought 03:09 pm Cybercrime cost UAE Dh5.14b this year Mideast ICT spending to grow 3.6% Lenovo launches first AR-enabled smartphone Symantec to buy LifeLock for $2.3 billion Emirates NBD launches virtual banking assistant tags from this storySyria follow this tag on MGNSamsung follow this tag on MGNPaul McCartney follow this tag on MGNGoogle follow this tag on MGN filed underGulfNewsBusinessSectorsTechnology tagsSyria follow this tag on MGN+ MGNSamsung follow this tag on MGN+ MGNPaul McCartney follow this tag on MGN+ MGNGoogle follow this tag on MGN+ MGN Also In TechnologyUAE e-tailers slash prices to boost sales Business Gallery Highlights: Guangzhou Auto Show 2016 Kish island turns to be a major tourism hub Business Videos PlayStrata UAE leads aerospace manufacturing Video: Electronics fiesta as Gitex opens FOLLOW US Most Popular ViewedCommentedVideosPictures 01Cybercrime cost UAE Dh5.14b this year 02$81m cyberheist: 5 bankers charged 03Alibaba-Meraas opens Dubai data centre Play Strata UAE leads aerospace manufacturing Oct 25, 2016 Play Emirati who created 2 successful companies Jan 02, 2016 Play Video: Electronics fiesta as Gitex opens Oct 01, 2016 Play Emirates Group announces record profits May 10, 2016 10Images A peek at the world's next tallest tower Apr 11, 2016 8Images Pictures: Apple Store in Abu Dhabi Oct 27, 2015 13Images Gold bars that can be used as emergency payment Dec 26, 2012 8Images Fujairah’s new supertanker jetty Sep 26, 2016 Currency Converter first-currency currencyAEDDinarRupee= first-currency currencyINRDinarRupee Most Popular on Gulf News Dubai: Get ready for National Day sale Look: Mohammad, son Zayed out for lunch Manager summoned for holding passport Couple burnt charcoal to kill themselves Rain forecast in UAE over next few days Tiger attacks girl in Saudi Arabia Why it’s bad for UAE expats to hoard cash More UAE firms offer better gratuity pay New Abu Dhabi-Dubai highway almost ready Close Recommended For You Trump taps Governor Haley for UN ambassadorPUBLISHED ON Nov 23, 2016 What did Henry Kissinger Tell Donald Trump?PUBLISHED ON Nov 23, 2016 Wife confronts husband, lover in hospitalPUBLISHED ON Nov 23, 2016 Feedback Get The Paper Our Apps Mobile friendly version Our location Advanced Search Sitemap MY GULF NEWS GulfNews.com is the most widely read newspaper, and online site in English in the Middle East.

Google is beginning its rollout of the latest software to the Nexus 6P, Nexus 5X, Nexus 6, Nexus 9 or a Google Pixel C, Nexus Player and the Android One. It may still be some time until the update comes to your Android device though – Google hasn't specified which devices will get the upgrade first and the list of supported devices are only set for Nougat "over the coming weeks." Google has also announced the first non-Nexus device to boast Android N will be the unannounced LG V20, which is set to launch on September 6. LG had previously confirmed the V20 would come with Android 7 software, but now Google has confirmed the company would be the first to release a device running Nougat. Rolling out now The new software update will come to other selected Android devices in the future - if you have a recent flagship phone you may get the upgrade, but there's no guarantee. Some manufacturers are faster than others at pushing out upgrades too. If you want to know when your phone is set for Android N, check out guide for which phones will be getting it and how long it will take. Android 7 brings with it new Quick Settings controls, an improved battery saver mode, security updates, multi-window support and 72 new emoji. The big feature missing from this update is Google's new VR service called Daydream, which will come in a future update for selected devices. Unless you have the ZTE Axon 7 though - or maybe the Galaxy Note 7, as Samsung has yet to confirm if the device will support Daydream - you won't be able to run it on your current device.

A report stemming from Bloomberg indicates the company is recruiting YouTube stars to create a catalog of exclusive 360-degree virtual reality videos design to run on Daydream compatible smartphones. Specifically, Google is funding 360-degree video from YouTube celebrity Justin Ezarik, known as iJustine on the platform. According to Bloomberg, Google is spending “hundreds of thousands of dollars” on VR content for the upcoming platform. At I/O 2016, shortly following the unveiling of the upcoming virtual reality, Google showed off IMAX, NBA and a Hulu apps all running on Daydream-certified Android devices. The tech giant plans to expand this offering by paying in the “high six figures” range for video games, with smaller amounts of cash being spent on films designed to utilize Google’s Jump 360-degree video platform. Daydream is Google’s attempt at bringing virtual reality to the masses by creating a universal platform that runs on hardware-certified VR devices, giving developers a viable VR platform to release apps, games and other software on. Few phones have been Daydream certified, with ZTE’s Axon 7 being the only device so far to receive approval.

I’m hoping Daydream really takes off for developers. Smanny I think it was mentioned earlier that a SD 820 was supported for Daydream VR, and a minimum of 4gb of ram is needed, as well as fast sensors with low latency. Many phones right now meet that criteria. However the low latency sensors tend to be a problem for many phones. That is why some have resorted to putting sensors on the headsets instead of the phones. Patrick O’Rourke Yea, I’ve heard that as well. My understanding is the requirements haven’t really been confirmed yet. I know it’s rumoured the Note 7 is set to be Daydream certified.

It’s not a stretch to argue that readers don’t like these ads. So Google is making a call that websites that use pop-ups and interstitials are worse search results and may rank them lower because of it. There are a "hundreds of signals" that go into Google’s search result rankings, so it’s not like every website that uses these ads will feel pressured to remove them overnight. If a site with a pop-up still has the best information, it’s still likely to appear first. But this change ought to benefit one site over another when those two sites appear roughly equal otherwise. Google’s changes could make a difference over time Google’s intention is to not just direct people to more informative results, but to results that work better for them — e.g., don’t annoy them with a pop-up — too. This is something Google has increasingly been doing with its search algorithm. Last year it began boosting the rank of "mobile friendly" websites, and in 2014, it began boosting the rank of sites with encryption as well. As you’re probably aware, not all websites offer mobile sites, and most websites are still not encrypted. So it’s not like every time Google says "jump" that developers and publishers immediately jump. But search ranking is something that most developers pay close attention to — it’s often a major source of visitors — and Google’s continued nudges could make a difference in the long run. These new changes will go into effect next year, beginning on January 10th. From that point on Google will start lowering the rank of sites "where content is not easily accessible." "Reasonable" banner ads are still okay For the most part, Google is targeting overlays that gray out the content beneath them to prevent you from reading a website, either for a few seconds or until you find and very carefully tap a little X to dismiss them. These count regardless of whether they load immediately after a page is opened or whether they appear after scrolling a certain distance. On top of that, it sounds like Google will also count ads that create the effect of a pop-up without actually being a pop-up, by taking up most of the page after a site is loaded (you may have seen one of these if you’re reading this article on mobile). Not all pop-ups and overlays will be counted in Google’s new rankings. Pop-ups needed to meet a legal requirement — like verifying someone’s age — are still okay, as are smaller banners at the top of a screen that use, in Google’s not-at-all-defined formula, a "reasonable amount of screen space." Publishers are likely to be unhappy about the change, as it’s liable to take away either visitors or ad revenue. And it’s fair to question whether Google should be the one to dictate when ads are and are not acceptable. But that all said, its intention here seems to be pretty reasonable. These ads make websites into slightly worse search results, and Google is going to start treating them that way.

Home Top 50 How To Magazine Franchise Events Subscribe 33 min read Google Chrome The 100 Best Free Google Chrome Extensions Image credit: PC Mag Eric Griffith From PCMag Writer Instagram Instagram Adds Live Video With a Twist Make More Happen Google Will Tell You How Crowded Places Are in Real Time Silicon Valley Trump Won't Destroy Silicon Valley ON-DEMAND EVENT STRATEGIES TO GROW YOUR BUSINESS Watch Now August 23, 2016 This story originally appeared on PCMag It's been an up and down couple of years for Google's Chrome Web browser. When we first did a version of this story in January 2015, Chrome had about 22.65 percent of the browser market worldwide, according to Net Applications. As of July 2016, Chrome has 50.95 percent -- it crossed paths with Microsoft Internet Explorer in March, when both hit 39 percent. IE continues to dwindle, as does Firefox and Safari. Only Chrome and Microsoft's new Edge browser have gained, but Edge is only at 5.09 percent of the market.   Then it lost some kudos -- from us. After several years as PCMag's favorite browser, a resurgent Firefox took our Editors' Choice award. The reason: Chrome lags in graphics hardware acceleration, and it isn't exactly known for respecting user privacy (just like its parent company). That said, Chrome remains a four-star tour de force for Web surfing, with full HTML5 support and speedy JavaScript performance. Obviously, there is no denying its popularity. And, like Firefox before it, it's got support for extensions that make it even better. Its library of extras, found at the Chrome Web Store, is more than rival Firefox has had for years. Also, the store has add-ons to provide quick access to just about every Web app imaginable. Rather than having you stumble blindly through the store to find the best add-ons, we've compiled a list of 100 you should consider. Several are unique to Google and its services (such as Gmail), which isn't surprising considering who made Chrome. Most extensions work across operating systems, so you can try them on any desktop platform; there may be some versions that work on the mobile Chrome, too. All of these extensions are free; there's no harm in giving them all a try -- you can easily disable or remove them by typing chrome://extensions/ into the Chrome address bar and right-click an extension's icon in the toolbar to remove it. As of Chrome version 49, every extension must have a toolbar icon; you can hide them without uninstalling the extension with a right-click and selecting "Hide in Chrome Menu." You can't get rid of the icons for good. Read on for our favorites, and let us know if we missed a great one! Screen/page capture Awesome Screenshot  Don't limit yourself to basic screenshots. Make them awesome by annotating them with shapes, arrows, and text comments. One click uploads an image to AwesomeScreenshot.com for storage and sharing quickly to social media. Diigo Web Collector Dubbed a "multi-tool for personal knowledge management," Diigo is a nice mix of social bookmarking (remember Delicious?) and full info grabber like Evernote. This extension puts the service to work, letting you bookmark, archive and annotate everything you see online. You get unlimited bookmarks for free, but Diigo will charge you $7/year to get it without advertising. Sign up at Diigo.com. Send to Kindle for Google Chrome Lots of people prefer to read on their Kindle devices (or use Kindle apps on tablets and phones). If you find a Web page with a long-form article on it, use Amazon's extension. It will reformat pages and send them directly to your Kindle of choice for reading later. You can even get a preview before you send it.  Evernote Web Clipper This is a must-have for anyone embracing the Evernote life. Evernote is still the premiere way to clip and store everything worth keeping online. This extension makes it a breeze, even isolating what it sees as the main content of a page and storing just that. It now even has built-in annotation features. When you save a screenshot, tag it sufficiently and you can search through it all later using Evernote.com or the offline software and apps (at least two of them). OneNote Web Clipper Microsoft's OneNote app/service does a lot of the same things as Evernote. Now with its own Clipper extension, it can do the same thing in Chrome: save anything you see online. Lightshot Lightshot is a lightweight screen-capture tool that works with a touch of the toolbar button to capture just what's in the browser (or download the full program and tap the print-screen key to get anything appearing on the monitor). It has an entire army of tools at its disposal, from upload-for-sharing to annotation. It will even instantly send what you capture to Google to do a search for similar graphics. Save to Pocket  Pocket (once called Read It Later) is all about letting you read content you find... later. Set up an account and start saving content with the Pocket extension, bookmark buttons or apps. One click "Pockets" the content so you can access it anytime -- even offline -- on all your devices -- there are Pocket apps for everything. Content isn't limited to text; you can store video to watch later, too. Readability Set up an account on Readability first, then install this extension. Click the drop-down menu for the option to read now in a clear, uncluttered interface; read later when you visit your Readability.com account. You can also print, share via social networks or send text to your Kindle so you have plenty to read while mobile. Screencastify Need to make a video out of what's in a tab? Screencastify will do it without needing any other external software. And it works beyond the confines of the browser tab. Videos are easily saved to YouTube or Google Drive. The free version allows videos up to 10 minutes long. Google services Boomerang for Gmail Ever written a Gmail message and wished you could schedule it to go out a few hours later? Boomerang handles that for you, and you don't even have to be online when it sends. You can track replies, but you only get a limited number of free messages per month. Checker Plus for Gmail Ever wanted to check your email but didn't feel like expending the extra energy to open a new tab? No judgments, we've been there, too. The best extension for users of multiple Gmail accounts -- I've got three! -- is Checker Plus. It gives you fast access via a drop-down menu in Chrome, desktop notifications, color coding, even voice input for writing messages. It even reads your mail to you -- all without actually visiting Gmail. Users of the Awesome New Tab Page app get full integration. A donation of any amount unlocks even more features. This is a must-have for any Gmail junkie. Checker Plus for Google Calendar Never open Google Calendar again. This extension gives you full access to everything you like about Google Calendar from your Chrome toolbar, plus multiple methods of adding calendar events, such as right-clicking on a webpage to add it like an appointment. The notifications (including voice) are perfectly done. It even runs in the background when Chrome is closed, so you never miss an engagement. Docs PDF/PowerPoint Viewer (by Google) When you click a link to a PowerPoint presentation or PDF file with this extension installed, you'll be shunted directly to Google Docs Viewer to view the file. You don't need to download it and open it in PowerPoint or Adobe Reader, or re-upload it to Google Drive first. It's essential if you've given your productivity life over to Google Drive. Gmelius Google thinks it knows exactly what users want, so sometimes it makes interface changes to Gmail, which can be infuriating. Gmelius (pronounced Gmail-e-us) gives you back some control, restoring old interface elements like the original compose window or clicking the Gmail logo to return to the inbox. It also can hide features no one likes -- such as advertisements. The standard version is free; premium is available for a one-time $25 fee per user, so you can install it on as many PCs as you want using the same account. It's also available on Safari and Opera. Google Dictionary Load it up, double-click any word on any webpage and you'll see a pop-up with the definition. Or search for words from the toolbar. Multiple languages are supported. Google Translate Ever visit a foreign website and wish you could read it? This extension gives you the ability to do so by auto-detecting the language in use and offering the option to show it in your preferred language. Goo.gl URL Shortener  Access Google's own URL shortener service (found at Goo.gl) via the Chrome toolbar with this extension. It instantly truncates the URL you're visiting and copies the new address to the clipboard for use anywhere. It will even generate a QR code of the URL. Click on Details and you can see where and how often the shortened URL has already been used. Google Hangouts Say farewell to Voice and embrace Hangouts, a chat feature built into Gmail. You can add a sidebar for Hangouts via this extension so it's available on every page you visit -- and if you've got Google Voice, you can set it to receive your SMS and voicemail messages. If you have multiple Google/Gmail accounts and want to switch, well, you can't, but you can use Chrome's built-in support for Chrome Profiles to get access. Google Voice (By Google) Google's languishing voicemail service is still useful for some, and can be plugged right into your browser. This extension offers on-the-fly access to your voicemail messages (with transcriptions) and SMS texts (to which you can reply), and you can initiate VoIP calls over Google Voice. Every phone number you see on a site becomes clickable for calling. Rapportive Wondering who just emailed you? Rapportive loads a sidebar next to every message (replacing the ads!) giving you the full low-down on contacts, from their social-networking haunts to recent status updates and more. Friend them on the fly when you get a new message. You can even make notes about them to access later. It's "relationship management" in your email. Also available for Firefox and Safari users. Save to Google Drive Google Drive may be your primary workplace and storage area, but it's sometimes tricky to put what you want in the cloud repository. This extension makes it a breeze. You can save an entire webpage, or just the downloadable elements such as images or documents and send them directly to Google Drive. It will even import Microsoft Office documents. Interface/utilities AdBlock and Adblock Plus Adblock Plus is a community-driven extension ported from Firefox, while the unrelated AdBlock adds video ad blocking on sites such as YouTube and for Flash-based games. Considering the video-ad blocking extras, and that Adblock Plus whitelists some ads it deems "acceptable," AdBlock (also available for Safari, Opera, and Firefox) is probably the slightly better pick among two excellent products. µBlock Origin Looking for an alternative to Adblock or Adblock Plus that's a little less resource intensive? Try µBlock. Chrome Remote Desktop There are many times when it would be handy to be able to control someone else's computer from afar, or let others take control of yours for tech support. Many tools exist to make this happen, but arguably none are as easy to implement as Chrome Remote Desktop, since it's all done via the browser extension. It workscross platform for Windows and Mac users -- even Chromebooks. Take control of the PCs from your mobile devices -- Android, naturally, but also on iPhone. Hover Zoom There are a lot of thumbnail images on sites like Google Images, Flickr, deviantART and social networks. This extension shows you the full-size image when you hover your mouse over any tiny thumbnail, assuming there's a larger image available. Image Downloader Bulk download all the images on a single webpage with this extension. It will display all the images, and you can specify which ones you want before the download starts. IE Tab In days of yore, many websites were optimized for Microsoft's Internet Explorer. If you encounter some in your browsing travels along the Information Super-Highway, use IE Tab to load the page using IE's rendering engine, while still remaining within a Google Chrome tab. Full Contact If you have fewer than 5,000 contacts in Gmail, or multiple contact lists, Full Contact is the way to keep them forever cleaned up and synced with Google. Set up the account at FullContact.com, then install the extension to give it access to your Google account. The contacts there are the bridge between all your various address books. Lazarus: Form Recovery It's happened to all of us: we've filled out a complicated form online, hit a button and some error loses it all, forcing us to refill every single box. Lazarus saves your work as you type in any form, so if there's an error or crash, it brings it back. Hooray! Noisli Like your ambient noises to help you keep the focus? Noisli has a drop-down menu full of them to play, with a sleep timer to turn them off after a pre-set time. Stylish If you've ever used Greasemonkey on Firefox, you'll appreciate Stylish. This extension works with scripts you download from userstyles.org to transform the look of websites. There are thousands of scripts that can help you improve your browsing on Facebook, Tumblr, Google and elsewhere. Xmarks Bookmark Sync Chrome has its own excellent method of syncing bookmarks, tabs, passwords and settings (using your Google account), but Xmarks goes one step further by syncing among all major browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, Safari and IE -- on the same or multiple computers. Readism When you read a story on Medium, you get an estimate of how long it will take to read the article. Readism applies that same thought to every page you visit, in theory helping you better manage your time. Right-click a link, and you'll get the estimate without even visiting the page. Speedtest by Ookla Ookla has ported Internet speed tester from Speedtest.net to an extension that lives in the Google Chrome toolbar. Instantly check your download and upload speed as you visit new sites, to see how they impact performance. You can also check your Internet speed right here. (Disclosure: Ookla is owned by PCMag parent company Ziff Davis). Productivity Any.do A popular task list service in itself, Any.do has created what is arguably the best to-do list extension for the browser. It syncs with the service, lets you drag and drop new items and attach notes and even turns Gmail messages into tasks. The Android and iOS apps let you take tasks on the road. Assistant.to Install it to become part of your Gmail and Google Calendar and you'll be making meetings so much easier. Assistant.to is the assistant that you've wanted, giving you an easy interface to contact people and create the best possible meeting time for all involved. Related Content by Zemanta Zemanta is a blogger's best friend. Available for multiple OSes, browsers and blogging systems (specifically Blogger, WordPress and TypePad), this extension helps insert images and related article links. It sources them from big image sites like Flickr, and content sites like Wikipedia, IMDb and many more. Grammarly Grammarly promises that its 150 critical grammar and spelling checks in its free version outperforms even Microsoft Word, all in an effort to make you a better writer. Double-click words to get definitions and replacement synonyms. If you pay for the premium version, it adds 100 more checks, even gets genre-specific, so yousci-fi writers don't get the same issues as historical article writers. There's even a plagiarism detector in the paid version. Guess what? Grammarly works -- even if it doesn't work directly with Google Docs, it does work with Gmail, and even works with Microsoft Office via other add-ons. DuckDuckGo for Chrome Because it doesn't track you like Google does, DuckDuckGo is a search engine liked by those with serious privacy concerns. With this extension installed, a Google search also shows the top results for DuckDuckGo -- or you can go directly to searching with DDG by clicking the drop-down menu. Lingualy Ready to learn a foreign language, but don't want to spend the money on fancy Rosetta Stone programs? Lingualy boosts your foreign vocabulary as you surf with translations, quizzes and article recommendations. It currently supports French, English, Spanish, German, Arabic, Hebrew, Italian, Dutch, Russian, Portuguese and more. There are also mobile app versions. Lookup Companion for Wikipedia Wikipedia may be second only to Google for searches throughout the day (at least on my computer). Lookup Companion gives you toolbar access to search the user-built encyclopedia of everything, with results appearing in the drop-down that easily open in a new Chrome tab. Pushbullet Notifications are all important for mobile and desktop users these days, but they're seldom in sync. Pushbullet hopes to change that, with this extension that matches up what you get on the Pushbullet apps on iOS and Android. You'll see calls come in even on your desktop, be able to forward files from PC to smartphone, and more. There's also an extension for Firefox, and Pushbullet has an IFTTT chafnnel, making it almost infinitely extensible. MightyText You're at your PC. Your Android phone is in your pocket. You get a text. Don't waste time fishing it out. MightyText shows you your texts in Chrome (even on your tablet). All the messages you send and receive are synced, as long as you have an Android phone with the MightyText app installed. You'll even get low-battery alerts about your phone in the browser and photos and videos will sync up. There's an extension specifically to get MightyText messages in Facebook or Gmail, too. Project Naptha If you've ever wanted to work with the text you see in an image online, Naptha is the key. Using optical character recognition, it makes the text in images copyable and editable. It will even help translate text from other languages. QuickDrop This one is for the Dropbox users. It adds a menu to Chrome with quick access for uploading or downloading files from your online storage. You can also use it to rename or share files. Create a special upload folder, and you can use the extension to do quick uploads of anything you see online with a right click. RescueTime for Chrome & ChromeOS Stop wasting time online. RescueTime measures how much time you spend at every website you visit (it pauses if the keyboard and mouse go untouched for two minutes or more), all in the background. Later, you can get a report of just which sites are your biggest time sucks. The full version, with alerts and site-blocking features and the ability to measure things you do while away from the computer, costs $9/month or $72/year. RSS Feed Reader If you are a fan of Firefox's Live Bookmarks, which puts an RSS feed right on the bookmarks toolbar, then you'll love RSS Feed Reader. It instantly tells you when there are new posts on your favorite RSS/Atom feeds and makes it easy to subscribe. It also has different themes so you can change how it looks. The Pro version with more features is $2/month or $20/year. WikiWand Wikipedia's presentation is a lot of things -- dense, interesting and busy -- but no one would call it pretty. Wikiwand makes it so. It optimizes all Wikipedia content with its own interface, and makes sure whenever you click a link for Wikipedia, you see Wikiwand's much-improved page look instead. You can even customize it, so the fonts and images come in just the way you like. You can also get Wikiwand for Firefox and Safari, plus an app for iPhone; Android is in development. StayFocusd Enable your self control by limiting the amount of time you're allowed to spend on websites in Chrome. Give yourself one hour a day on Facebook, that's it -- StayFocusd won't let you back on the site. It can block specific pages, whole sites, and even apps or games. Couple this one with RescueTime (above) and you'll be much more productive. Zotero Connector We gave the Firefox version an Editors' Choice a few years ago, and Zotero, even on Chrome, is still a researcher's (and student's) dream. It's a free way to track, manage, and share citations. Learn a lot more about putting it to use at Zotero.org. Timer Sometimes, you just need a countdown. Timer is a clean, clear on-screen timer that even works when your Chrome browser is offline. Auto Text Expander Don't type so much. This add-on lets you write little snippets that expand into full, frequently used text. Never type that annoying email out again -- just write it once and then type "jerks" whenever you want to use it (for an example that can't possibly come from real life). Security Authy The best-looking two-factor authentication app for mobile is also available as a Chrome extension. That means when you do a 2FA log in (for more on 2FA, read this), you don't necessarily have to have your smartphone available. Get the digits needed to authenticate your log-in right in the browser, to instantly copy to the site in question. If you're nervous about the security of websites at all, turn on 2FA whenever available. Secure Mail for Gmail (by Streak)  This extension might not be strong enough for the likes of Edward Snowden, but for those who need some basic open-source encryption on messages, it helps. Also known as SecureGmail, it prevents anyone snooping on your messages, by building in encryption/decryption tools. You'll be able to append a password to messages you send -- and the recipient won't be able to open it unless they are also on Gmail, also have the extension loaded and get the password from you. Click&Clean Enter a hot zone of privacy and security with this add-on. The drop-down menu from Click&Clean provides access to your browser cache, cookies, plug-ins, extensions and history -- and quick ways to erase them. You even get a full browser test to see how well Chrome is protecting you. It will help you scan for malware using Bitdefender, clear your private data and a host of other security options you're neglecting. Customize all the options to get full coverage with Click&Clean. Disconnect There's one goal with this extension: block all third-party cookies from social media and advertisers that follow you as you browse. Disconnect claims this helps speed up browsing by 44 percent on some pages. You can see the cookies you're blocking in case you want to let some through. Ghostery There's a lot going on behind the scenes as you surf the Web. Bugs, beacons, pixels, and more are used to track what you're doing. Ghostery is there to tell you what is happening in the background and give you control over these "extras." If you don't like a company or what it is doing, Ghostery can block scripts, objects, even whole images so you can retain your privacy. HTTPS Everywhere Visiting sites with "https://" in front of the URL (look for the green "lock" icon in Chrome's Omnibox for another indicator) means you're vising a site using SSL encryption -- a must for ecommerce at the very least. This extension ensures every site you visit that has "https://" as an option uses it, providing you another layer of security. LastPass LastPass remains a five-star PCMag's Editors' Choice for filling out forms and saving passwords to websites. It works across all operating systems, mobile devices and, of course, Web browsers, thanks to extensions like this one. It also imports stored passwords from other tools, as well. Personal Blocklist (by Google) Ensure that the sites you no longer want to visit -- or even see in search results -- are blacklisted from Google searches forever. You can block a site by domain name or even subdomain. WOT The Web of Trust is an online community that rates websites based on one major criterion: can it be trusted? The WOT extension is the first line of defense against sites with a bad reputation, showing red, yellow and green icons next to search results, providing you a heads-up notice before you click a link. History Eraser A five-star rating in the Chrome Store from over 10,000 reviews makes this extension an obvious must-have. That's because it saves your bacon if you've got something to hide by providing one-click removal of your browser history. Not just that, it clears the cache, downloads, saved passwords and form data, and will even do it for just a limited time period that you specify. Mailvelope Use the open source OpenPGP standard for encryption/decryption to secure your Web-based email messages. Mailvelope works with Gmail, Outlook.com, Yahoo Mail, Posteo and other mail services; it's also available for Firefox. Shopping AmazonSmile 1Button for Chrome Did you know that Amazon has a service called Smile that will make sure a percentage of every cent you spend at the site goes to your favorite 501(c)(3) charity? All you need to do is always buy stuff by going to smile.amazon.com, not amazon.com. This extension puts a button in the toolbar that takes you there -- but it also makes sure if you just type "amazon.com" in the address bar, or even click a link to Amazon, it switches to the "smile" subdomain instead. Add to Amazon Wish List The Amazon Wish List is the de facto online standard for making a big-honkin' list of items you crave, mostly because Amazon sells almost everything. Almost. Using this extension, when you see an item for sale on a different site you can add it to your Amazon list. Now people shopping for you can branch out beyond Amazon. Honey Honey not only automatically sees what shopping site you're on, and provides a drop-down list of applicable coupons (or links right on the site to get better deals -- that's how it works with Amazon); it also will automatically apply all the coupons it can to your checkout service on some sites, so you're not cutting/pasting/typing obscure, long codes. The Camelizer -- Amazon Price Tracker The Camelizer displays the full price history for an item, with some comparison to third-party sales. It won't tell you when savings are on the way, but it can help you decide when the cost is most likely to drop. It's dubbed "the Amazon Price Tracker" but The Camelizer now supports Best Buy and NewEgg, too. InvisibleHand InvisibleHand automatically scours the Web for lower prices. A little bit of your own legwork is still recommended, but with a pool of over 600 retailers in the U.S., United Kingdom and Germany, it's a great tool that should only get better with time. Flix Plus We all love Netflix, but the interface on the desktop isn't always forgiving. This extension gives you a lot more control over it, letting you move things around in your My List or DVDs, get rid of possible spoilers and duplicate entries or give half-star ratings when full stars just seems too much. Mockingbird Freebooks You won't want to kill this mockingbird. It's an extension that will tell you as you shop online book stores like Amazon, GoodReads, Audible and Barnes & Noble whether that same tome is already available for free elsewhere -- even if it's free as an audiobook -- from sources like Project Gutenberg, OpenLibrary and Librivox. Social/sharing Netflix Party Ain't no party like a Netflix Party! Rather than chill, this extension lets you start a Netflix movie or show, then start a party with any friends also running the extension, so you can watch together, even while remote. AddThis –Share & Bookmark (new) Set up an account at AddThis.com and install this extension. Click the drop-down menu on the tool bar (or right-click anywhere on a page) to instantly add content to social sites, translate info, bookmark pages or print. AddThis supports more than 300 services including the big-name social networks, blog systems and webmail services. Buffer If you'd like to schedule your social status updates to sites like LinkedIn, Facebook and Twitter (or multiple accounts on each) you need a buffer. Buffer has apps on all services and extensions for every browser. The Chrome extension puts Buffer in the toolbar, where you can use it to make a post that shares the page you're viewing and you can schedule posts to go live later. Buffer also integrates with lots of other services, like Pocket, IFTTT, Feedly, Instapaper and others. Instagram for Chrome Instagram addicts know how great the smartphone app is. This extension brings that same degree of photo-heavy Instagram-atical excellence to the desktop browser experience. Shareaholic for Google Chrome Shareaholic is a classic for any browser and a must for those who need instant access to social networks. From the drop-down menu, post directly to Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, Tumblr, Gmail, Evernote and more than 250 other sites with this one extension. It has the Goo.gl URL shortener (mentioned earlier) and Bit.ly built in, as well as Amazon Wish Lists for multiple countries. Share to Facebook If you're only going to share to Facebook, you don't need anything too powerful. This extension from Facebook itself will let you share links to the service, or with Facebook Groups or in Facebook Messenger. Silver Bird Silver Bird, once dubbed Chromed Bird, is a full Twitter client that lives in your Chrome browser. Gain direct access to your Twitter feed or trending topics from the toolbar, use it to upload images with your tweets and manage multiple accounts in a unified timeline. Spoiler Shield Hate reading the Web the day after House of Cards/Mr. Robot/Game of Thrones/Name Your Show Here or the big game and getting spoiled before you can see it? This extension promises to do its best to filter out the spoilers in social media feeds, thereby saving your day from utter ruin. Tabs Awesome New Tab Page When you open a new tab in Google Chrome, you get a page with some shortcut options, usually based on your installed Web apps. This extension puts a new interface on that New Tab page. It supports its own customizable, dynamic widgets, which you can move to fit your needs, all in a Metro UI-inspired look. You can customize search options for just about any site that has a search box, right from this page. Save the final results and you can import it to other computers using Chrome and Awesome New Tab Page. New widgets are being introduced all the time. It is, in fact, pretty awesome. Dayboard Turn your new tab into a to-do list with only the top five items next on the agenda. Empty New Tab Page The name says it all. With this extension installed, if you click to get a new tab you get one that's utterly empty. The Great Suspender The dozens of Chrome tabs you keep open constantly eat a lot of memory. Installing the Great Suspender reclaims some of those system resources. Leave a tab alone long enough and the extension "unloads" the tab to give your computer a break. You can always go back to the tab and reload it, or whitelist the sites that need to always be available, such as email or IMs. Incredible StartPage This extension optimizes your productivity when beginning your browsing session with a splashy look that displays your top bookmarks, notes and recently closed tabs. Your Chrome Web Apps get a separate section for launching and you can customize the appearance with beautiful background images. Momentum Inspiration, productive, beautiful -- they could all describe a new tab page made with Momentum, which uses incredible images for backgrounds on useful text you need (like what time it is). OneTab You open a lot of tabs. That can cause your Chrome browser to slow to a crawl. You can save all that memory by letting OneTab consolidate all the clutter down to one tab full of links to all those same sites. Papier When every new tab can and should be filled with your new notes, you needPapier. Notes are backed up right to Chrome (but sadly, it won't sync across multiple PCs with Chrome, even if they're all on the same Google account); add to them with each new tab opening. If you need the note immediately, a click in the ellipsis menu at bottom left can create an export. It even has a night mode withdark background. Panic Button Sometimes you visit sites you shouldn't. Sometimes your co-workers and bosses come up behind you. What do you do? WHAT DO YOU DO? Hit the Panic Button, courtesy of HideMyAss. It instantly hides all incriminating sites, which you can restore once the coast is clear. Session Buddy Still with 5 stars after 18,000+ reviews; that might be a record. What does Session Buddy do so well? Those with an egregious number of tabs open agree that this manager might be the best way to see and organize them all in one place, save them for later, recover tabs after a crash and export tabs for sharing. TabCloud If you open a lot of tabs and want to revive them after you've closed the browser on your computer -- or on other computers, or your Android handheld -- TabCloud will assist. It saves tabs for later access or for simultaneous use on multiple systems. Tabs Outliner Tabs Outliner provides a look at all your tabs in a resizable, vertical window -- tree-style, like you find in Windows Explorer. Closing a tab doesn't remove it from the tree, making it ultra-easy to return to that page, so there's no difference between an open or "saved" tab. When you're sick of all the work, there's a button to close every tab and you're out. TooManyTabs for Chrome Sometimes you just open too many tabs. Exceed 20 and the interface is nearly impossible to use. This extension manages the overflow, providing a bird's-eye view of open tabs. It can search the open tabs and sort them by domain, title or creation time. VerticalTabs Tabs can hog a lot of space at the top of the browser window. If you don't like that configuration, VerticalTabs places them in a vertical drop-down menu accessible from the toolbar. Tab Snooze Sometimes there's tabs open in Chrome that you just don't need at that moment, such as an article you're dying to read. If it can keep until after lunch, snooze that tab for later in the day, that evening, the next day, even the next week or the next month. Or pick a day. Or just mail it to yourself to read whenever. Ultidash Turn your new tab into a full dashboard with all the extras you can imagine pushing you to new levels of productivity. The brand-new Ultidash builds in to-dolist, a site blocker with a Pomodoro Timer, analytics about your work habits and sites visited.  Video Magic Actions for YouTube YouTube videos get a beautiful, configurable makeover with Magic Actions. Use your mouse wheel to control volume, select HD or cinema mode (with darkened background), go into the HD mode of your choice automatically and turn off the auto-play as desired, among other fantastic options. If you want, it even hides the ads in videos and, best of all, hides the comments. That's where trolls live. It's also on Firefox and Opera. Video DownloadHelper There are lots of Chrome extensions that will download video -- but not from YouTube. That would go against Google's rules. You can get around that by side-loading a Chrome extension like this one. It supports a huge number of sites, even a few of the more adult variety. (For more, read How to Download YouTube Videos.) Hotspot Shield Free VPN Proxy -- Unblock Proxy Sometimes to get to see what you want, or write where you want, even if you're not physically there, you need a VPN that will help spoof your location (as well as keep your traffic secure). Quite a few integrate directly with Chrome. Anchorfree's Hotspot Shield provides this proxy service puts no limit on the bandwidth used and says it'll give you access to blocked sites in some countries including Netflix and Facebook and YouTube (just keep in mind, some of those services, like Netflix, are on to this.) Others to consider: Browsec VPN and TunnelBear.   MakeGIF Video Capture Just watched a YouTube or Vimeo video that would look great with no sound and on a constant loop? Then you need to make it into an animated GIF file, stat. This extension makes capture of any HTML5-based video easy -- just click the blue button on the toolbar. MediaPlus Typically you only get to watch video or view images in a webpage at the size the page creator intended. MediaPlus however, gives you control over Flash content and other media. Move them around the page, resize them, open them in a new window, add effects and download them to play offline.   More from PCMag Freshservice The Best Human Resources Management Software of 2016 Freshdesk Google Chrome Technology Hacks Tips and Tricks Company Advertise Brand Licensing Contact Us Staff Contribute Upcoming Events Entrepreneur 360™ Livestream Growth Strategies On-Demand Event Products Business Books Reprints & Licensing Classifieds Entrepreneur Lending Entrepreneur Coaching Editions United States Middle East India Español Philippines South Africa China Connect Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Instagram YouTube Flickr Tumblr RSS Feedly Subscribe Now Gift Subscriptions Subscriber Services Digital Editions iOSAndroidKindle Copyright © 2016 Entrepreneur Media, Inc.

Home Mail Flickr Tumblr News Sports Finance Celebrity Answers Groups Mobile More Yahoo Search Search 0 Mail Tech Home Follow Us Reviews How To Deals Video Games Pogue Apple Android 7.0 Nougat is finally here, but when will your phone get it? Zach Epstein BGR NewsAugust 23, 2016 Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share Android 7.0 Nougat is here! It's finally here! But, well, not really... Last year, Google released Android 6.0 Marshmallow and as of Google's latest Android version distribution numbers, it's only installed on 15.2% of active Android devices. To quote a certain presidential candidate, sad! Despite the fact that Android update adoption continues to mosey along at a dreadfully slow pace, the company on Monday released yet another new version of Android. If history has taught us anything — and it has — Android Nougat will become the most popular version of Android sometime in 2018. But don't worry, because you likely won't have to wait quite that long to get it on your Android smartphone. DON'T MISS: I built a Wi-Fi paradise and all I needed was one device When Apple releases a new iOS software update, it's released directly to end users. By controlling iPhone hardware and software Apple is able to bypass third parties (though third parties are obviously involved with testing). Android, of course, works differently in most cases. When Google releases a new Android software update, it has to be tested by Google. And Android device makers. And wireless carriers. Compounding matters is the fact that while Apple only sells a few different iPhone models, Android vendors offer many different phone models at any given time. So, while Google did in fact release Android 7.0 Nougat to the public on Monday afternoon, the only people who can use it for the time being are owners of Google's Nexus branded smartphones. So, when are you going to get Android 7? If you're reading this right now, the odds are fairly good that you're a savvy tech fan who owns a fairly recent flagship Android phone model as opposed to an older phone or a mid-range device. Newer flagships are always the first to get Android updates, and things trickle down from there. As for when the latest crop of smartphones is set to get Nougat, the bad news is that info is scarce for the time being. As both ZDNet and Wired report, however, we can learn a bit from the past. So far only HTC has confirmed anything, having stated that the HTC 10, HTC One A9, HTC One M9 and unspecified other handsets will be updated to Android 7.0 Nougat later this year. That sounds a bit vague indeed, but there are only four months left in 2016 so the wait can't be too long. As for other smartphone vendors, you're probably in fairly good shape if you have a newer Motorola smartphone because Moto is generally quick with updates. LG has a good track record as well. Samsung generally takes a bit longer, which is certainly understandable since it sells far more smartphone models and works with far more carrier partners than any other Android vendors out there. So, if you have a Samsung smartphone, odds are good that you'll still be running an older Android version when you ring in the new year.

But these stocks have done better. Evelyn Cheng | @chengevelyn Tuesday, 23 Aug 2016 | 2:21 PM ETCNBC.com SHARES Chesnot | Getty Images Google CEO Sundar Pichai Alphabet has climbed 1,700 percent since it went public a dozen years ago under the name Google, but 10 other S&P 500 stocks, mostly in tech, have eclipsed the search giant's gains. "Most of the innovation's coming out of that sector," said Paul Hickey, co-founder of Bespoke Investment Group. He noted the outperforming tech firms were generally software-focused companies that have harnessed scale to generate revenue. Topping the list is a whopping 11,600 percent gain by Monster Beverage, followed by a 6,900 percent rise in Priceline shares. Illumina is up nearly 6,600 percent and Apple almost 4,700 percent, while salesforce.com is up almost 2,500 since Google went public on Aug. 19, 2004. "You always worry about valuations, overpricing, but there might be a premium for what some of the disruptors may provide in an overall slow growth environment," said Ben Pace, CIO of HPM Partners. Also among the top S&P 500 performers over the last 12 years are three of the so-called "FANG" stocks — Facebook, Amazon.com, Netflix and Google — these growth names were particularly popular last year when a very narrow group drove much of the S&P 500's performance in 2015. To be sure, those super-strong gains don't come without a lot of volatility. All the big fliers have had a big fall, sometimes more than 60 percent. show chapters 12 years after Google IPO    Friday, 19 Aug 2016 | 2:17 PM ET | 03:10 "Some of them have really turned into really good, solid businesses and they've really grown into their multiples," said Thomas Lee, co-founder and head of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors. He noted it's a good reminder that sometimes investors "can't be multiple sensitive." Netflix is up more than 4,000 percent and Amazon.com is up more than 1,800 percent. Facebook wasn't publicly traded at the time of Google's IPO. Shares of the social network have gained more than 220 percent since its IPO on May 18, 2012. "I don't think the FANG stocks are as important as they were in 2015," said Marc Chaikin, CEO of Chaikin Analytics. "They're doing well, which is always a comfort, but it is the average stock in the S&P that's propelling the market to new highs." Over the last 12 years, the broad S&P 500 index is up nearly 100 percent to record highs. That's far less than Google's gains, but the historically high price-to-earnings ratio for the index raises concerns for bull market skeptics. Investors may also want to watch when growth stocks start losing momentum. "You're not going to be able to buy (the outperformers) cheap," Hickey said. "They tend to have much more volatility. You have to have a pretty strong stomach to ride the wave." And external pressures, such as slow global growth, can also weigh. Under pressure from the sluggish economic recovery and post-financial crisis regulation, financials dominate the S&P 500 laggards since Google's IPO. AIG is nearly 95 percent lower, Citigroup off nearly 90 percent and Bank of America 65 percent lower over that time.

 Amazon's fastest growing business has a surprisingly strong competitor in China Eugene Kim Aug. 23, 2016, 2:29 PM 5,046 facebook linkedin twitter email print Alibaba founder Jack MaREUTERS/Lucy Nicholson Amazon Web Services is Amazon's fastest growing and most profitable business, on pace to generate over $10 billion in revenue this year. That makes it the largest public cloud vendor, far outpacing its two main competitors, Google and Microsoft, in this space. But Goldman Sachs believes AWS's real competition could soon come from a company that's not even based in the US: Alibaba. In a note published Tuesday, Goldman Sachs writes Alibaba's cloud computing business, called Aliyun, is on pace to generate $5 billion in revenue by 2019, giving it an enterprise value of $42 billion by then. That's still a fraction of the $178 billion in enterprise value AWS is expected to reach by 2019, but it would place Aliyun in firm second place in the cloud infrastructure space, Goldman Sachs writes. "At these values, [AWS and Alibaba] would be two of the largest infrastructure technology companies in the world," the note said. Goldman Sachs noted Aliyun's cloud quarterly revenue jumped a staggering 140% year-over-year, and has generated roughly $600 million in total revenue over the past 12 months, almost at the same level of what Google's cloud service is estimated to have done in the same period. But despite its fast growth, Aliyun remains largely unprofitable, seeing negative 35% operating margins last quarter — unlike AWS's 30% operating margin. Goldman Sachs Goldman Sachs isn't the only Wall Street firm to notice Aliyun's massive future potential. Baird Equity Research wrote in a recent note that Aliyun is still "undervalued" by many investors and there's a huge long-term opportunity because of its focus on the Chinese region. It wrote: "In our view, many investors currently undervalue Aliyun’s long-term market opportunity, and we believe Alibaba is well-positioned to be the cloud computing leader in China due to preferential government policy, regional focus, domain expertise from operating the core Alibaba marketplace sites, and an inherent advantage among SMEs due to Taobao and Tmall." And with the Chinese IT market expected to keep its robust growth rate, Aliyun's business will only get bigger, according to market research firm SunTrust: "Looking forward, we anticipate strong revenue growth will continue as cloud takes share of the ~$30-40B IT market in China. Further, AliCloud forecast that the China IaaS market would grow from ~$0.6B in 2015 to $7.8B in 2018. With this secular tailwind, Alibaba was confident at analyst day it could support multi-year growth >100% based on those projections."

If you'd like to learn more... - A A + Listen On Aug. 23, 1991, the way humanity communicated with one another was forever changed with the creation of the World Wide Web. The man responsible was Tim Berners-Lee, a British computer scientist who was working in Switzerland’s CERN (there was no particle accelerator then). READ MORE: Facebook rolls out suicide prevention tools to Canadians Story continues below In order for scientists to access information at CERN, they had to physically go to different computers. Berners-Lee thought this was inefficient. At that time, the Internet was already connecting millions of computers. He realized that, using this emerging technology, information could be shared using hypertext, which was created in 1965 by Ted Nelson. In March 1989, Berners-Lee proposed this to his boss who, believe it or not, wasn’t all that impressed. Instead, he wrote “vague but exciting” on the proposal. Still, Berners-Lee managed to get time to further develop his idea. By 1990, he had created three vital technologies that we’re quite familiar with today: HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), URI (uniform resource identifier, which we now call URL) and HTTP (hypertext transfer protocol). The proposal written by CERN scientist Tim Berners-Lee, marking the advent of the World Wide Web. Copyright CERNJ By the end of the year, the first web page was up on the Internet, and by 1991, the public was invited to use it. Berners-Lee knew that, in order for the web to grow, it had to be readily and freely available to the public. So, in 1993, the code was made available to anyone around the world. Thus, the World Wide Web was born. Happy #InternautDay everyone! 🎉 🎉 Thanks to @timberners_lee we've had public access to the #worldwideweb for 25yrs pic.twitter.com/bxbcpUOUUK — JUMP (@yousayjump) August 23, 2016 A look back According to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), in June 1993, there were 130 websites. By December 1993 that number had almost doubled to 623. Between 1993 and 1994, there was a growth of 2,006 per cent as the number rose to more than 2,700 sites. And just four years later it had grown to roughly 650,000. Today, there are more than one billion. You can even see the live stats on Internet Live Stats. Here is a look back at the birth of some of the most popular websites over the years (click on the link to see what it looked like at the time). 1991: World Wide Web Project It was what started it all. Thank you, CERN and Tim Berners-Lee. 1994: Yahoo! Yahoo! ruled the early days of the Internet. By 1998, it was the most popular web portal for Internet users. However, since 2000, its popularity has declined, though it remains one of the most-read news and media websites. 1994: Amazon The way people shopped was forever changed with Amazon. The online shopping site — originally called Cadabra — was founded in 1994 by Jeff Bezos. He changed the name to Amazon and the site first went online in 1995. Originally beginning as an online bookstore, today it sells everything from DVDs to electronics to bedding to clothing. It is worth an estimated US$250 billion. 1996: AOL Though America Online (AOL) was founded in 1983 as Control Video Corporation, it eventually outgrew its video gaming foundation turning to the Internet. It gets its own website address and drops its monthly fee of $19.95, providing Internet users with access to mail, news and more. The AOL website on December 20, 1996. Wayback Machine 1998: Google Today, Google is a worldwide presence. “Googling” was even added to the Oxford Dictionary in 2006. The name is a play on the very large mathematical number of a googol, which is a 1 followed by 100 zeros. The search engine is quickly praised for its ability to source information on the Internet. Google’s webpage on December 2, 1998. Wayback Machine 1999: PayPal Today, PayPal is the world’s largest payment system, allowing people to transfer money easily. The company was founded in 1998 as Confinity, which developed security software for phones and other hand-held devices. It became what it is today in 1999, founded by John Malloy. In 2000, the company merged with X.com, an online banking company founded by tech guru Elon Musk, today best known for SpaceX and Tesla. 2001: Wikipedia According to Wikipedia, the online encyclopedia launched on Jan. 15, 2001. It initially began as Nupedia, in 2000, which would hold peer-edited, expert written content. However, it never got off the ground. Instead, the creators decided to create a new website where anyone could contribute and edit. Of course, that caused some headaches as the site was criticized for its inaccuracies. However, since then, efforts have been made to better edit its content. Today, it is available in 271 different languages. Wikipedia’s home page on March 31, 2001. Wayback Machine 2004: Thefacebook There is no doubt that Facebook made an enormous impact on society and the way we communicate, whether one believes it to be positive or negative. Initially created by 23-year-old Mark Zuckerberg as a Harvard University social network, today the site boasts more than one billion daily active users around the world. Thanks to Facebook, we now know what people eat, where they go, what they think about your political views and how cute their cat is. 2005: YouTube YouTube was born out of PayPal when the company’s employees created a video-sharing website. The first video uploaded was titled, “Me at the Zoo.” By 2006, it was one of the fastest-growing sites on the web and in 2006 was bought by Google. In fact, due to the increasing popularity of YouTube, and then other sites that followed, in 2008, an article in the Telegraph claimed that experts were warning that the entire Internet could collapse entirely. 2006: Twttr Adopting the saying, “Brevity is the soul of wit” from Shakespeare’s Hamlet, Twitter taught us to keep our thoughts short and simple. The website and application was founded by Jack Dorsey and Evan Williams as a way to text on their cellphones. The first tweet was sent by Dorsey on March 21 that year. Now you know who to blame for the rise of bad spelling and grammar. just setting up my twttr — Jack (@jack) March 21, 2006 Since the advent of the World Wide Web, the way we see the world has changed dramatically. Facebook reunited us with those we thought would remain part of our past, left only to fading memories. We only need to check our phones to see events unfolding around the world in short tweets. If we’re unfamiliar with a topic, we simply need to type the words into Google which in turn turns up a multitude of entries, usually the first of which is Wikipedia. It’s unlikely Berners-Lee thought his invention would impact the world in such dramatic fashion.

The carmaker's move follows more than $1 billion in investments made earlier this year by Detroit-based General Motors Co in a pair of Californian technology companies to keep up with Google's autonomous-car project and Uber Technologies Inc's ride-hailing business. While old-school mechanical engineering remains in the Midwest, as does some low-skilled factory work that hasn't moved to Southern states, these investments show Detroit carmakers have realized that they must go to the nation's technology center to find the software expertise needed to make the cars of tomorrow. Traditional automakers now directly employ hundreds of people in Silicon Valley, which is also home to Tesla Motors Inc, which is based in Palo Alto. "The shift to California is undeniable," said Eric Noble, president of the CarLab consulting firm in Orange, California. "The technological development for autonomous vehicles and intelligent cars will continue to be done in Northern California because that's where the knowledge is." Tough realities Ford and GM face a few tough realities in their race to keep pace with the high-tech leaders. Companies such as Google and Uber threaten to upend the industry by turning car owners and drivers into passengers who simply pay for a ride. Even though the carmakers and the state of Michigan are developing tech talent, Silicon Valley is still ground zero for the people who write code, create driverless algorithms and come up with new business models for mobility. Ford has invested in Velodyne Lidar Inc which develops the laser-based sensors that are the eyes of self-driving cars, and 3-D mapping company Civil Maps, both of which are based in California. The Dearborn, Michigan-based carmaker also acquired SAIPS, an Israeli-based computer vision and artificial intelligence designer. It has also reached a licensing agreement with Nirenberg Neuroscience LLC, whose founder, Sheila Nirenberg, has developed a machine-vision platform that Ford said can bring humanlike intelligence to self-driving cars. "We came to Silicon Valley - there are a lot of great places around the world - but the ecosystem here is just unbelievable," Ford CEO Mark Fields told reporters. "It's like a bazaar of ideas, and everybody's open."Smooth cruise GM CEO Mary Barra last year took her top leaders to visit tech companies and venture capital firms to get their thoughts on fostering innovation. GM went on to buy a 9 percent stake in Lyft Inc, a competitor to Uber, for $500 million. GM also spent more than that to buy San Francisco-based Cruise Automation, which writes software for autonomous driving. Owning Cruise, which has grown from 40 employees to 100, has helped GM hire people who may not have been interested in working for an automaker, Mike Ableson, GM's vice-president of global product planning, said in a June interview. Some people want to remain in the California environment but also have the stability of a large company, he said. Similarly, Ford's announcement may have been intended to present the maker of F-150 pickups as an "exciting destination for human talent", Adam Jonas, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, said in a research note. "There is at least a perception in the market that all the cool kids are going to places like Uber, Google, Tesla or China," he wrote. Ford and other automakers "want to change this". Michigan man Despite this trend, Michigan is fighting back. Governor Rick Snyder said recently that Alphabet Inc's Google announced in May that it will open a self-driving car research center in suburban Detroit and that Harman International Industries Inc, the audio and automotive technology company, opened its North American headquarters nearby.

Only those devices supported during the Developer Preview phase - the Nexus 5X, 6P, 6, 9, Player and Pixel C (as well as the non-Nexus General Mobile 4G) - will be eligible to upgrade at first. But while plenty more phones and tablets from manufacturers worldwide will be able to upgrade to Nougat in the weeks and months ahead, two devices from Google's Nexus family will be left behind. The Nexus 5 and Nexus 7 (2013) weren't part of the Developer Preview program for Android 7.0, but some owners were still clinging to the hope that Google might give the devices one last hurrah, with a bump up to the latest version of the OS. But the reality - as Google's own support site notes - is that the Nexus 7 (2013) was only in line to receive 'guaranteed Android version updates' until July 2015, while the cut-off for the Nexus 5 was October 2015. The same site also points out that Nexus devices are only guaranteed to receive monthly security updates "for the longer of 3 years from availability or 18 months from when the Google Store last sold the device". That means that in addition to having ended OS updates for the two devices long ago, Google is also likely to stop releasing security patches for the Nexus 5 and Nexus 7 (2013) in the next few months. The company is already preparing for the future of both its Nexus program and Android. Two new handsets, built by HTC, are expected to be unveiled in the next few weeks, while Android will transition to quarterly 'maintenance releases' between major updates.

Some prominent tech sites have just released reviews of Android 7.0 Nougat, so here’s a roundup of some early reviews that will give you an idea of what Android 7.0 has to offer. Ars Technica: Nougat's new features make big phones more useful Ron Amadeo at Ars Technica has a very deep and detailed review of Android 7.0 Nougat that runs 13 pages : In my five months of using various developer and final versions of Android 7.0 Nougat, my big takeaway is that Nougat significantly improves the user experience on big screen phones. The new “Display Size” feature is the most significant improvement, allowing users to finally reduce the UI scale of apps. This allows phablet users to see more on the screen at a time while still keeping everything at a reasonable size. Before Nougat, a bigger screen usually just meant a bigger UI, which still showed roughly the same amount of information. Fans of data density will love Display Size. Larger phones can definitely make better use of the new split screen mode, too, giving you more space to see both of your apps. For the really big Android devices (tablets), the OS got a little less worse when compared to iOS. A tablet in split screen is basically like two smartphone apps side-by-side, which matches up well with Android’s lack of tablet app selection. The big shame with split screen support right now is that app support for it is awful. Most apps (aside from video players) fail to update when they aren’t the being focused on by the user. Get on that app support, developers! Split screen isn’t just about seeing two apps side-by-side, though. It also brings a resizable app framework that will power Android apps on even bigger devices than tablets, like Chrome OS laptops. Throw in Android’s experimental multi-window support, and one day we might get a fully-desktop ready Android OS someday, too. We won’t see all the ramifications of Android 7.0 for some time. Besides resizable apps changing things all over the ecosystem, we’ve got platform changes aimed at creating a VR ecosystem on Android with Daydream, Vulkan support for game developers that will someday enable OS UI changes, and a reworking of the partition layout to a system that we won’t get to test until new hardware arrives. Good Nougat unlocks the power of a big screened phone with an adjustable UI size and split screen apps. The new notification panel. Drill down into bundled notifications or hold an entire conversation without ever opening an app. New Quick Settings brings toggles right to the notification panel and is customizable by users. “Notification Power Controls” brings tons of fine-grained controls over notifications. The dual system partition setup sounds like OS update will never (well, probably never) brick a device again. Bad App support for split screen is seriously lacking. With the exception of video apps, today it’s easy to end up with one live app and one frozen screenshot of an app living side-by-side. Ugly Another release and another year of ignoring Android’s update problem. More at Ars Technica The Verge: Android 7.0 is great but which phones will get it? Deiter Bohn at The Verge liked Android 7.0 Nougat but wondered how many devices will actually get it: Google has announced that the latest version of Android, 7.0 Nougat, is rolling out to newer Nexus devices starting today. It’s a good upgrade, but only available if you have a recent Nexus device like the Nexus 6, 6P, 5X, Pixel C, or Nexus 9 tablet — and it will take some time for everybody’s devices to receive the over-the-air update. I’ve been using the various public betas that have been running since March of this year and most of the bugs have been worked out. Nougat isn’t radically different from the last version, Marshmallow, but does add a handful of notable user-facing features. Some of them, like improved multitasking, are long overdue and really useful on tablets. The rest are tweaks around the edges — but there are bigger changes underneath that should make Android faster and more secure, too. But the story of Nougat isn’t really whether it’s any good. Instead, it’s the same old Android tale: unless you have a Nexus, it could be a few months, it could be a year, before it becomes available on your phone. The real story of Nougat isn’t happening today, it’s going to happen over the next few months as we watch to see which Android phones will actually be updated. What kind of story is this? For Nexus owners, it’s a heartwarming yarn. For nearly everybody else, it’s a mystery. More at The Verge WCCF Tech: Android 7.0 Nougat is uninspiring and could have been much better Uzair Ghani at WCCF Tech found Android 7.0 Nougat to be a bit of a disappointment: Since the past couple of years, Android updates have hit a concrete wall. Feature additions have gotten pretty mundane while focus on under the hood changes have become key for Google. Obviously, that’s a good thing, for some folks out there, but it’s a approach that doesn’t stand the test of time really very well. Users get frustrated after seeing the same thing over and over again. Same is absolutely true when you compare Android 7.0 Nougat directly with its predecessor, Android 6.0 Marshmallow. Don’t get me wrong here – Nougat is a good update in its own right and fares definitely better in terms of stability and performance compared to Marshmallow, but as a user I am frustrated to see the same thing from last year rehashed under a new name. So if you’re expecting something groundbreaking in this release, then you might want to lower your hopes. A lot. Basically, it’s clear in this update that Google has used up most of its feature-related resources and is now focussing on playing safe in the smartphone and tablet space, leaving a lot to be desired. In other words: Nougat is a pretty uninspiring release, but yet it gets the job done on a user level. More at WCCF Tech The Guardian: Android 7.0 is a great update Samuel Gibbs at The Guardian noted Android 7.0’s improved notifications, longer battery life and speed improvements: It features longer battery life, improved multitasking and smarter notifications in a slimmed down and refined Android experience – following on the work done in last year’s version 6 Marshmallow It is faster, more polished and a subtly-better experience all-round. Apps install more quickly, the OS can be smaller in size and updates to Android can be installed on the fly, without having to wait for 10 minutes while it reboots, if you have a new device. The new Vulcan API graphics system is also baked in for better gaming performance and Nougat will support Google’s Daydream virtual reality system, eventually. Nougat is not, however, a major visual overhaul of Android. Those that have used Marshmallow on any of Google’s Nexus smartphones or devices with little in the way of modification to Android, such as the OnePlus 3, will instantly recognise it. Overall Android 7.0 Nougat is a great update. It makes some significant changes under the hood that provide benefits including longer battery life. The visual tweaks are subtle and most will likely be masked by the customisations made to Android by third-party manufacturers. More at The Guardian The best new features in Android 7.0 Nougat There are plenty of new features in Android 7.0 Nougat and Lifehacker has a helpful roundup of what you can expect to see in the latest version of Google's mobile operating system. Chris Jäger reports for Lifehacker: Today, Google began rolling out its latest mobile operating system — Android 7 (AKA “Nougat”) — to select Nexus devices. Here are the major changes you need to know about. The OS formerly known as Android N is officially out today for a range of Nexus phones. Now dubbed “Android Nougat”, the new mobile operating system ushers in some noteworthy improvements and new productivity tools which we’ve included below. Smarter notifications Multi-window mode Quick Switch Icon size adjustments Advanced file manager Data Saver Doze mode Customise Quick Settings Direct replies from notifications bar Multi Locale language settings 72 new emojis Vulkan API JIT Compiler Virtual Reality mode More at Lifehacker The official Android 7.0 Nougat release announcement Last but certainly not least (just in case you missed it) is the official announcement of Android 7.0 Nougat from Google's Android blog: Today, we’ll begin rolling out Android 7.0 Nougat to Nexus devices. And with more ways to make Android your own, it’s by far our sweetest release yet. We took a different approach to building and launching Nougat this year. For starters, we invited developers to take a sneak peek at Android N back in March, so they could bring their apps to the new platform earlier. And of course we asked you to help us come up with names for this year’s release, resulting in lots of great ideas, and a delicious unveiling back in June. Today, and over the next several weeks, the Nexus 6, Nexus 5X, Nexus 6P, Nexus 9, Nexus Player, Pixel C and General Mobile 4G (Android One) will get an over the air software update** to Android 7.0 Nougat. Any devices enrolled in the Android Beta Program will also receive this final version. And there are many tasty devices coming from our partners running Android Nougat, including the upcoming LG V20 which will be the first new smartphone that ships with Android Nougat, right out of the box.

To everyone’s dismay they weren’t, which left all of us wondering when we’re going to see the official launch of some much anticipated software additions. According to Nate Benis, the man behind the Pure Nexus ROM, discovered that the version of Android Nougat released yesterday does not match up with the leaked build for the upcoming Nexus Marlin. This suggests that Google is planning on implementing more features in the future, and may be holding off on releasing the Nexus Launcher and Google Assistant until the first Maintenance Release which is due next month as part of a developer preview. Current version of Android N that is being pushed to nexus devices is based on developer preview 5 and does not have any of the “proprietary features android police and myself have been leaking” expect a developer preview of mr1 with these changes soon It’s possible that we may see the release of Google Assistant (with Allo) and the Nexus Launcher next month, but it’s more plausible that we’ll have to wait until the release of the 2016 Nexus devices. We’ll just have to keep waiting impatiently for Google to give us all the goods.

Most Popular Google is investing hundreds of thousands of dollars apiece in virtual-reality films and programs, part of a plan to line up exclusive content for the debut of its new Daydream service in the coming weeks, according to people familiar with the matter. Google will help promote projects from Hulu and fund the production of 360-degree videos with YouTube stars like the Dolan twins and Justine Ezarik, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing private deals. The division of Alphabet has also partnered with video-game producers and sports leagues to boost its biggest virtual-reality initiative. "It's apparent they've spent a lot of money internally," said Finn Staber, co-founder of TheWaveVR, a virtual-reality startup developing a music app for Daydream. Related Stories Digital Duopoly: Google Follows Facebook Results With an Amazing Quarter of Its Own Google Goes Up Against FaceTime With New Video Chat App Duo Comcast Leads $6.8 Million Investment Round in VR Studio Sony to Release PlayStation 4-Compatible VR Headset in October The company is relying on apps, shorts and games to promote Daydream, a hybrid store and software service that Google hopes will be the dominant way people engage in virtual reality, much like Android is for smartphones. An update to Android software that will support Daydream began rolling out Monday. The idea is to encourage the growth of the technology and ensure Google maintains a central role in helping people find things to watch. Google is entering what has quickly become a crowded marketplace, with products from Facebook, Sony, Samsung and HTC. Whereas Sony's Morpheus headset is tethered to its PlayStation video-game console, Google is focused on mobile-based VR, whereby consumers snap their phones into a visor or headset. With the headset on, Daydream presents users with an array of apps, from YouTube to HBO Now. "Google's Daydream will help advance mobile virtual reality," said Oren Rosenbaum, a digital media agent at United Talent Agency who spearheads its VR effort. "Mobile virtual reality is what's going to get the most people to strap things on their head." While competitors are targeting users willing to spend hundreds of dollars for top-notch VR equipment, mobile will reach mass audiences, Mr. Staber said. In June, he watched a live performance at the video-game expo E3 in Los Angeles from the comfort of his Austin home. "It's revolutionary," Mr. Staber said, adding he and his partners had been collaborating with Google's VR team over the past few months. Google's growing investment in virtual reality tantalizes filmmakers eager for more resources. While Facebook has spent millions of dollars on individual projects, most large media companies have been circumspect about investing too much money in a new storytelling medium with a small audience. This being Google's first major virtual-reality content initiative, the company doesn't want to spend too much just yet and is spreading money around to see what works, the people familiar with the matter said. Google is spending high six figures on video games, and is offering from low five figures to low six figures for projects with filmmakers and online talent, the people said. Filmmakers working with Google must use a 16-camera rig optimized for the company's Jump software platform for virtual-reality content. GoPro is making one, called Odyssey, priced at $15,000. Though a few elite VR filmmakers have either balked at the budgets or the requirement that they use Google's camera, dozens of filmmakers have signed up to work with YouTube, the people said. YouTube won't demand an ownership stake in the projects filmmakers create with its funds, since the Google division is more interested in encouraging creative people to produce content around the debut of Daydream to stoke awareness and excitement. YouTube will be one of dozens of apps available within Daydream, alongside HBO's streaming service, Hulu and apps from sports leagues like the NBA and MLB. Google will co-market some of the programming. Though its projects won't be exclusive to Daydream, Hulu will time the release of several pieces to the debut of Google's platform. Daydream will be introduced around the same time as the release of new Android phones, VR headsets and controllers. The latest version of Android has VR-enhancing features including faster graphics processing, quicker head tracking and better use of data from multiple sensors. Google had been working on its own headset, but the company has mainly focused on reference designs for headsets, and controllers, for other companies to build their own VR devices. It would rather turn Daydream, known to some as Android VR, into the dominant interface for virtual reality. Google designed a controller to make mobile-based VR more interactive. With a headset on, people can use the remote to navigate and select apps. The company is offering creative and financial support to apps that use its controller, such as Tilt Brush, a painting app it purchased in April 2015, and the Wave, which enables DJs to create and perform music live for people wearing headsets either in the audience or sitting at home. "They want more content in the store to get people talking," Mr. Rosenbaum said. "Google investing in the space continues the momentum and growth we're all expecting." -- Bloomberg News In this article: Celebrity Digital Digital Video Entertainment Mobile Technology VR Become a Member Register Now Renew Membership Benefits Datacenter Advertising Age     Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Instagram YouTube Tumblr Copyright © 1994-2016 Crain Communications Privacy Statement Terms of Use About Us Advertise Reprints Contact Us AD AGE Creativity LookBook Datacenter Resources Events Jobs On Campus Site by AREA 17 x Scroll to Continue

The research study covers the present scenario and growth prospects of the global smart wearable entertainment devices and servicesmarket for 2016-2020. The report also presents the vendor landscape and a corresponding detailed analysis of the major vendors operating in the market. It includes vendors across all geographical regions. The top vendors in the smart wearable entertainment devices market are Apple, Garmin, Google, Samsung, and Sony. Likewise, AT&T, EE, Sprint, and Telefónica are the leading vendors for smart wearable entertainment services. Technavio ICT analysts highlight the following four factors that are contributing to the growth of the global smart wearable entertainment devices and services market: Growing popularity of entertainment devices among youth Augmented use of smart glasses for entertainment and gaming Increased focus on R&D activities Strategic alliances by smart wearable providers Growing popularity of entertainment devices among youth The popularity of entertainment and gaming devices that provide a real-time virtual experience has increased over the years. These devices enable virtual 3D movies and HD gaming experience. The adoption of these devices is high among the age group of 18-24. The smart wearable entertainment devices provide easy access to movies and games on wearable screens. Devices such as Oculus Rift, iTVGoggles, and Sony's head-mounted display, HMZ-T3, use virtual reality technology to provide real-time music, video streaming, and video gaming experience to users. Therefore, the increased adaptability of these entertainment devices has increased the growth of the market. Augmented use of smart glasses for entertainment and gaming Smart glasses are portable devices that provide real-time entertainment and gaming experiences to end-users. These glasses enable users to capture 3D images, stream virtual videos, and enhance their virtual gaming experience. Google Glass provides a platform for consumers to share their videos and pictures on social networking websites such as Facebook and Twitter with the help of pre-installed apps. It also provides Google maps. In the words of Rakesh Kumar Panda, a lead analyst at Technavio for M2M and connected devices research, "The adoption of smart glasses is high in North America and Western Europe. However, the deployment of high-speed internet connections will increase the demand for smart glasses in the emerging regions. Google Glass and Epson Moverio BT-200 figure among the smart glasses commonly used by end-users to enhance their overall entertainment and gaming experience." Increased focus on R&D activities The market is highly competitive with several leading vendors providing a wide range of innovative products at competitive prices. Various companies are investing heavily in R&D to provide innovative offerings to increase their market share and remain competitive in the market. The smart wearable devices function with the latest technologies such as gesture recognitionand augmented reality. Devices such as Fin, Ring, Kapture, and Myo are some of the products equipped with modern features. Fin is a smart wearable device worn on the thumb; its functioning is based on finger gestures. Vert, Babolat play, and D3o are some of the innovative products listed in the International Consumer Electronics Show 2015. Vert is a wearable device specially designed to improve the jumping capability of athletes. Babolat play is a tennis racket used to record information such as total and effective play time, technique, power, and consistency of the player. Strategic alliances by smart wearable providers Many established telecommunication providers are collaborating with smart wearable device providers to support and boost the development of wearable device technology, driving the growing demand for smart wearable entertainment devices worldwide. Telecom providers aim to integrate the services offered by them with smart wearable devices to provide innovative offerings at competitive prices. Such offerings not only increase the demand for these products in the market but also help the telecom and device providers expand their market base.

With software comes hardware, too, but while we may have to wait just a tad longer for the upcoming Nexus devices to be unveiled officially, VR may be really close… According to a Bloomberg report, in fact, Google’s proprietary VR platform, Daydream, is virtually — no pun intended — ready, and just waiting for a few final touches to be made before being given the green light “in the coming weeks.” Those “final touches,” however, may represent something bigger than they suggest, as Google is reportedly teaming up with big partners such as Hulu as well as popular YouTube stars (the Dolan twins and Justine Ezarik are mentioned) in order to create exclusive VR content to accompany the official arrival of the platform. With apps, shorts and games put front and center in Daydream’s store, Google is both aiming at furthering the expansion of virtual reality as a whole as well as making sure that its platform stays firmly at the helm. This will be made easier thanks to Daydream’s focus on mobile VR rather than the (much) more expensive desktop-based platforms. Competitors such as HTC (with its Vive) and Facebook (Oculus Rift) will be left in a different realm. There’s also a strong interest coming from filmmakers, the report suggests. This being Google’s first major virtual reality content initiative, the company doesn’t want to spend too much just yet and is spreading money around to see what works, the people familiar with the matter said. Google is spending high six figures on video games, and is offering from low five figures to low six figures for projects with filmmakers and online talent, the people said. Given that filmmakers working with Google need to use cameras optimized for the company’s Jump platform (such as GoPro’s $15,000 Odyssey), a few of them have apparently balked, however “dozens” of others seem to be onboard with the project — and so are YouTube, Hulu, HBO and NBA’s as well as MLB’s streaming services, which will all be offering VR apps at launch. It’s yet to be determined whether Google will launch its own VR (or, perhaps, mixed reality) headset later this year, or if it will rather leave other OEMs to focus on hardware instead. What we do know is that affordable and nearly-universally accessible virtual reality may be just around the corner, and that when it comes, it will be here to stay.

DeepMind NHS health data-sharing deal faces further scrutiny Posted Aug 23, 2016 by Natasha Lomas (@riptari) 0 SHARES Next Story Google will soon start punishing mobile sites that show hard-to-dismiss popups A controversial data-sharing agreement between Google-owned AI company DeepMind and the UK’s National Health Service (NHS) has caught the eye of the National Data Guardian — the government appointee who works with the Department of Health to try to ensure citizens’ confidential health data is safeguarded and used properly. The NDG role does not have powers of enforcement, so cannot launch a formal investigation into the data-sharing arrangement, but a spokeswoman told TechCrunch the NDG is “considering how data was shared by the Royal Free [NHS Trust] with Google DeepMind”. “Dame Fiona [Caldicott, the NDG] and her independent advisory panel have asked for and received information about the project, which is currently being considered to assess whether any guidance or advice from the National Data Guardian would be of assistance to this or similar projects,” the spokeswoman added. The NDG will be publishing minutes of a meeting it held earlier this year with DeepMind and the Royal Free tomorrow — we’ll update this post with a link once the document is online. Update: The relevant paragraph from the minutes is as follows: 6. Google DeepMind discussion Following the recent media attention on the Royal Free’s agreement with Google DeepMind to develop an app aimed at improving the identification and treatment of patients at risk of acute kidney injury, a number of representatives from the Royal Free and Google DeepMind attended the Panel meeting. A discussion took place around the clinical aims of the project, the data sharing and security arrangements, the information available to the public, and plans for next steps in developing the app and the underlying algorithm. Action 6.1: NDG Office to draft a response on behalf of the Panel to the Royal Free to confirm the Panel’s understanding of the discussion and the project and to raise any additional questions. The same Royal Free-DeepMind data-sharing agreement is already being investigated by the UK’s data protection watchdog, the ICO, which confirmed to TechCrunch today that its probe remains ongoing. An ICO spokesperson said: “We are in contact with the National Data Guardian about this matter and we continue to make enquiries of the Royal Free in relation to the data shared with Google DeepMind.” “Any organisation processing or using people’s sensitive personal information must do so in accordance with the Data Protection Act,” the ICO spokesperson added. At the time of writing neither DeepMind nor the Royal Free had responded to a request for comment on the NDG’s action. Update: In a joint statement the pair said: We were grateful for the opportunity to meet with the National Data Guardian and provide further information on the Streams app during its development. We continue to work closely with all relevant organisations and regulators who are interested in learning more about our work. We hold ourselves to the highest legal and ethical standards, especially on matters of patient privacy, clinical safety and data security. NHS data-sharing and due process This is just the latest regulatory bump in the road for the data-sharing agreement between DeepMind and the Trust — which was inked last September and publicly announced in February this year; the first such collaboration between the Google-owned company and the NHS. (DeepMind has since announced another collaboration, with a different NHS Trust: Moorfields Eye Hospital). The Royal Free data-sharing agreement has been criticized for the amount of patient identifiable data being shared (especially as, unlike the Moorfields collaboration, the patient data is also not anonymized). Data being shared under the agreement includes real-time inpatient data from the Trust’s three hospitals across multiple departments, as well as historical in-patient data going back five years. The Royal Free Trust and DeepMind have maintained that patient consent to the sharing of the data in this instance can be implied (rather than explicitly obtained), because they say they are using the data for so-called “direct patient care”. Which means a clinician helping an individual patient with their own care. However the app the data is used to power — called Streams — targets a particular condition, called Acute Kidney Injury — and it is inevitable that not every patient whose data has been shared with DeepMind will go on to develop and/or be treated for AKI by a clinician at the Royal Free’s hospitals. Streams has also only been used for three user tests so far which TechCrunch has learned entailed it being used it in parallel to other clinical decision-support processes. The app itself was not used to make any decisions about patient care during these tests. All of which is to say that so far the NHS patient medical records shared with DeepMind for Streams have only been used to further the development of the software itself. So quite how R&D of a decision-support app also constitutes ‘direct patient care’ — the necessary threshold required for sharing data without explicit patient consent, in this instance — remains unclear. In more extensive user tests of the UI of the app DeepMind deployed fake data. But in the three user tests in the Royal Free hospitals real-world patient medical records were used. A spokeswoman for the NDG said the body does not generally comment on individual cases, and further noted that in this instance it cannot comment because it is currently considering the arrangement — having contacted DeepMind and the Royal Free to provide details to its panel of experts earlier this year, back in May. It is possible the NDG will gain more formal advice powers in future, given the role is relatively new — set up in November 2014, following another unrelated data-sharing controversy, and with the UK government only publishing its response to a consultation on the role’s remit and powers this summer. Once the NDG gains statutory powers, it will mean NHS organisations will need to consider any formal advice when they are drawing up data-sharing agreements with outside entities, such as DeepMind. (At present there are only a set of Caldicott principles that NHS Trusts are supposed to take into account when making decisions about whether and how to share patient data — but it’s up to individual Trusts to interpret these guidelines.) The UK’s ICO and the CQC (Care Quality Commission) remain the two existing bodies with enforcement powers in this area. One of which, the ICO, continues to investigate the Royal Free-DeepMind data-sharing agreement, as noted above. Earlier this year it also emerged that DeepMind and the Royal Free had not registered the Streams app as a medical device with the relevant regulatory body, the MHRA, prior to testing it in hospitals. The pair was subsequently contacted by the MHRA and told they did need to register the app. The last of the three user tests of Streams was stopped on the same day, May 11 — after only three days of testing. (In February the app was tested for a week, between February 6 and 12; with the first test, in December, also lasting three days, from 12 to 14.) The Streams app remains out of commission for now, although the pair have said they are committed to deploying it in future — i.e. once they have registered it with the MHRA. Announcing DeepMind’s Moorfields research project last month, co-founder Mustafa Suleyman, referred back to the Royal Free collaboration — tacitly acknowledging the not-so-smooth sailing of the project in an almost-but-not-quite mea culpa moment. “Treating this data with respect really matters,” he wrote in a Medium post entitled ‘Our commitment to the NHS‘. “There are different authorities that give different types of approvals and oversight for NHS data use: HSCIC, HRA, MHRA, ICO, Caldicott Guardians, and many, many more. We’re committed to working with all these groups, and making sure with their help that we get it right.” In a recent statement provided to TechCrunch a DeepMind spokesperson again defended how NHS patient data is being shared under its agreement with the Royal Free: Streams is clearly a tool designed to be used for direct patient care, supporting clinicians to provide the right care to patients at risk of developing AKI. For the tool to work, and to ensure doctors and nurses receive the right information about the right patient, Streams needs to process patient identifiable information sent to it by the Royal Free. It’s normal that the early on-site user testing of Streams was conducted alongside existing clinical systems, and this doesn’t change the basis on which data is being processed — which is the same basis for many other third party services active within a hospital setting. We’re now past the prototyping phase and are looking forward to putting Streams into production, so we’re working with the MHRA on that basis. The Royal Free and DeepMind continue to refuse to disclose the exact number of clinicians involved in testing Streams thus far. Nor will they specify how many patients passed through the hands of those clinicians during the user tests of the app. So it remains impossible to quantify the reach of the app vs the amount of patient identifiable data being shared to power it.

One of my readers, Sam Medina, asked me for some ideas on iPad storage today. I’ve put together a few ideas. We need them because Apple is weaving iCloud ever more deeply into our devices which means many seek alternative ways to store some things in order to keep costs down. Here are six different storage solutions you might want to use as well as or instead of iCloud. Public clouds Many iOS users choose to use alternative cloud-based services to eke out their iCloud storage. They may keep all their documents in Box or Dropbox and automatically stash their images using Google Photos (though some users have noticed the latter app can consume large quantities of storage). You may also want to take a look at the up-and-pCloud service. This promises 10GB free storage space (up to 1TB for $7.99/m) and provides a range of highly secure fee-based services. (Also look at other popular services, including Google Drive). Private cloud 1: Promise Technology, Apollo I’m only now taking a look at Apollo Cloud, so I can’t speak for how effective it is. On first sight the connected 4TB storage system seems promising. You can access it from any Mac,s PCs or iOS devices on the same network, or get to it remotely as your own private remote cloud, so long as its online. Compatible with Time Machine you can use it to back up all your Macs, and it will also back up all your iOS data too. I think this is an interesting private cloud alternative for families, groups and SMEs, capable of handling everybody’s, essential data including photos, movies or media files. Private cloud 2: Some Seagate solutions If you want to use a portable drive as ad hoc storage but don’t want to bother fiddling about with lots of cables, take a look at Seagate’s Wireless Plus and Seagate Personal Cloud Home products. Wireless Plus offers 1TB of storage and hosts its own built-in Wi-Fi connection. Because Wi-Fi is built into the drive you don’t need to join an existing Wi-Fi network to access it. This means you can back up and retrieve data to/from your iPad or iPhone whenever you like, using the Seagate Media app. The product also supports AirPlay, so you can use it to stream media to Apple TV. Seagate Personal Cloud Home offers a similar set of features (and adds Plex support) but needs to be on the same Wi-Fi network as your iPad in order to work. You can also share files externally using these systems. Local storage: Acronis True Image 2017 The latest edition of this veteran cross platform online storage system lets you do unique things such as backing up your Facebook information; and also lets you back up your iOS, Android and other mobile devices, as well as Macs/PCs. It’s an alternative to Time Machine, I suppose, except using the Acronis app. What’s good about this is you can use any compatible third-party drive that is running the software as your backup destination, and back mobile devices up wirelessly to your PC, which can then back up using Acronis. Acronis True Image 2017 also lets you set up and manage backups across your devices remotely. The external Flash solution There are many Wi-Fi-enabled Flash drive readers. These contraptions will connect your iOS device to a Flash memory card using an app, enabling you to store and retrieve content. When I travel I use a Kingston MobileLite G2 system. This includes a Mophie-like battery recharge function, support for USB and SD cards and will create its own local Wi-Fi network, so you can piggyback numerous devices onto one connection. This has now been replaced by the G3 Pro model, which will charge your iPhone twice using its built in battery, hosts 64GB of its own storage and lets you access USB or SD cards so you can use even more storage. Like the G2 this also creates a local Wi-Fi network. Looking around online and other favorites include things like the funkily designed Leef or RAVPower File Hub Plus. What’s key is that once you have your data on the flash drive you should make sure you back that data up when you get the chance. The Flash drive The big problem with Flash drives for iOS devices is that these tend to need you to plug them into your iPhone or iPad. This means they drain a little power and make your mobile devices a little cumbersome. They are portable though so if you really must have something with you upon which to store the 3-hours of 4K movie you happen to be filming for your next Hollywood blockbuster, then take a look at something like the SanDisk iXpand Flash Drive. ##NB: It’s always good practice to employ at least two backup systems, many professionals will supplement online backups with local and even off-site backups of their data.

How about the last time you pulled out your phone to Google a random trivia fact? Chances are you’re doing far more of the latter these days—but that kind of convenience may have a downside. A new study suggests that our brains’ reliance on smartphones may be taking a toll on our thought processes for problem solving, memory recall, and learning. Researchers call the tendency to use the Internet (and specifically, those always-at-our-fingertips smartphones) as a memory aid “cognitive offloading.” And this habit, they say, is actually changing the way the brain works: While we may think of memory as something that happens inside our heads, it is increasingly happening with the help of outside devices. Whether this is a good or bad thing, they say, is a more difficult question to answer. The authors of the new report, published in the journal Memory, wanted to see how likely it was that people would reach for a computer or smartphone when quizzed on different topics. So they divided volunteers into two groups—one that was told to use Google and one that was not—and asked them challenging trivia questions about sports, pop culture, and history. Next, they asked much easier questions, giving both groups the option of using the Internet if they wanted. Even though the second set of questions required less knowledge, the people who had previously used Google were significantly more likely to go back to the search engine for help than those who had previously used only their memories. The Googlers also spent less time consulting their own memories before reaching for the Internet—and nearly a third of them did not even attempt to answer a single simple question from memory. The results suggest that our habit for cognitive offloading increases after each use, says lead author Benjamin Storm, assistant professor of psychology at the University of California, Santa Cruz. “Whereas before we might have tried to recall something on our own, now we don't bother,” he says. “As more information becomes available via smartphones and other devices, we become progressively more reliant on it in our daily lives." That’s not necessarily all bad, he points out: The Internet is obviously more comprehensive, and in many cases, faster and more dependable, than human memory. It’s helpful to have that wealth of knowledge always available—and to not have to keep every trivial fact or figure in our heads for easy recall. The Internet can also be beneficial, Storm points out, for older adults whose own cognitive capacities have begun to decline. But the broader implications of this research are ultimately much more nuanced, he adds. “Certainly there are advantages to becoming reliant on the Internet, especially given the breadth and depth of the information to which it gives us access, but there are also likely to be disadvantages,” he says. “To what extent, for example, does our capacity for wisdom and creative insight depend on the accumulation of internal knowledge?  These are the sorts of questions that will need to be answered.” Storm wants more research into the ways humans might manage their relationship with the Internet to take advantages of the benefits while minimizing those potential costs. For now, he says, Internet use in “healthy moderation” seems like the best course of action for those who want to keep their recall and problem-solving skills sharp. And maybe the next time someone asks you a question you’re not sure about, really think on it for a minute or two before whipping your phone out. “There might be something to be said about practicing one’s cognitive and memory abilities outside the context of the Internet,” Storm says.   This article originally appeared on RealSimple.com.

Share Tweet Share Tags : Android-Android+ Rooting & Modding-Rooting & Modding+ Software updates-Software updates+ Google-Google+ Amid the eagerly anticipated launch of Android 7.0 Nougat over the past couple of days, many have been waiting patiently for Google to post the factory images. Today the Big G has begun this process, allowing said users to, as the saying goes, get flashing! Android 7.0 Nougat brings an abundance of new features to Nexus devices including the Nexus 5X, Nexus 6, Nexus 6P, Nexus 9 and Nexus Player, while Google's Pixel C tablet has also been invited to the party. Casualties include the much-vaunted Nexus 5, which despite its status as a cult hero to many, will end its journey on Android 6.0 Marshmallow.  Rooters and hobbyists wielding any of the Nougat-ready devices can rejoice that Google has started the factory image roll-out, if a tad belatedly. Posted over at the Android Developers site, those looking to install a factory image on their device will probably want to take a system backup before proceeding, since all data will be wiped during the flashing process. If you're not familiar with words like rooting, flashing or factory images, then your best bet is to update to Nougat through more traditional means. We have a little tutorial on how this can be achieved, which you can sift through by hitting this link.  Back in May, it was revealed that Google had begun to push OTA files alongside factory images. These OTA bundles allow users to sideload the firmware update without the hassle of bootloader unlocking, and do not wipe data during the process. Once again, Google is rolling out full OTA files with today's spate of Nougat factory images. While OTA may seem a familiar enough term, the sideloading process is still a tad more involved than accepting the terms of your traditional over-the-air notification. Thus, those uninitiated with the hackier side of Android should instead follow the aforementioned guide. A link to the images and OTA files can be found below. At the time of writing, the Pixel C and Nexus Player updates are ready to go. Images for the remaining Nougat-ready devices should be added imminently, so keep hitting that refresh button.  Meanwhile, if you'd like a run-through of the changes, take a peek at our Android 7.0 Nougat features round-up.

Otherwise i think Apple may have the superior OS as no one seems to have such issues with loss of battery during sleep unless using the FB app. view all comments Want to comment?

Here's how to get it. By Jack Wallen | August 23, 2016, 8:25 AM PST RSS Comments Facebook Linkedin Twitter More Email Print Reddit Delicious Digg Pinterest Stumbleupon Google Plus Image: Jack Wallen Google goes to great distances to bring new features to their flagship browser. The scope of these new features can be pretty widespread. Sometimes they are must-haves and sometimes they are fairly forgettable. Every so often one comes around that makes perfect sense, you wonder why it's taken Google this long to make it happen. Such is the case with the Personalized Tab feature. When working on a mobile device, getting relevant content quickly can make the on-the-go life of business a bit less hectic. Unfortunately, this can often mean opening up various applications. Or, when using an Android smartphone, you can trust that relevant content can always be found on Google Now. But what if you could get a Now-like feature tucked within the new tab page on Chrome? That could be seriously handy. As you might expect, Google has made that very thing a reality, and you can now test it out using the developer build of Google Chrome on your Android device. I'll be demonstrating this on the powerhouse, contract-free OnePlus 3. Before we go any further, know that this feature is currently only available on the dev build. But since the dev build is easily installed and used alongside the beta and/or the stable build, I highly recommend you installing it, even if only to preview up and coming features. What is the Personalized Tab feature? When you open a new tab on your mobile version of Chrome, you'll see a search bar and the Bookmarks, and Recent tabs buttons (Figure A). Figure A Image: Jack Wallen The stable Chrome new tab page. Not much there to see. Yes, you can search and take care of the standard tasks on your browser; but what if you wanted Google to suggest articles for you, based on your search history and other Google Now-related goodies? Here's what you do: On your Android device, open the Google Play Store Search for chrome dev Locate and tap Chrome Dev by Google In Tap Install Read through the permissions listing (if applicable) Tap Accept Allow the installation to complete You should now see a Chrome Dev app icon in either your App Drawer or on your home screen. Tap that launcher and the Dev build of Chrome will open. Scroll down and you'll see the Articles for you section (Figure B), where content relevant to your Google Now (and other) searches will appear. Figure B Image: Jack Wallen The Chrome Dev build new tab page offers a bit more. As you might expect, the more you use Google Now, the more relevant that content will be to you. Like a well-oiled machine Google is doing quite a bit to ensure all of the Android pieces work together, like a well-oiled machine. It only makes sense that Google Now would feed possible articles to the app you would use to view a good amount of your content. If you're willing to work with two iterations of Chrome on your device, which is perfectly safe, install the Chrome dev build and test out the new Personalized Tab feature. You might find yourself going back to the new tab page more often than you would have before. Automatically sign up for TechRepublic's Mobile Enterprise Newsletter for more hot tips and tricks.

Thanks to a press release sent out by LG a number of weeks ago, we’ve known this for some time now, but Google today confirmed the news: The LG V20 will be the first smartphone to ship with Android 7.0. “Today, and over the next several weeks, the Nexus 6, Nexus 5X, Nexus 6P, Nexus 9, Nexus Player, Pixel C and General Mobile 4G (Android One) will get an over the air software update to Android 7.0 Nougat. Any devices enrolled in the Android Beta Program will also receive this final version,” said Google’s Sameer Samat in the blog post introducing Android Nougat. “And there are many tasty devices coming from our partners running Android Nougat, including the upcoming LG V20 which will be the first new smartphone that ships with Android Nougat, right out of the box.” LG is scheduled to unveil the LG V20 at a special media event in San Francisco, California on September 6th. The company has already confirmed the phone will come to Canada. Related reading: Is this what the LG V20 will look like?

Here's how you can get it on any Android smartphone. By Jason Hiner | August 23, 2016, 8:17 AM PST RSS Comments Facebook Linkedin Twitter More Email Print Reddit Delicious Digg Pinterest Stumbleupon Google Plus For the past several years, TechRepublic's site analytics have shown that the most common Android phones accessing our site have all been Nexus devices. So, we know that a lot of professionals are into that pure, unmodified experience of Google's version of Android. However, even if you don't have a Nexus, you don't have to rush out and drop $400 on an unlocked Google device to get the Nexus experience. If you're running a Samsung, Huawei, HTC, LG, or virtually any other brand of Android phone with its own UI bolted on top of Android, you can download a few apps and give your device a similar uninhibited user experience to a Nexus. Here's how. 1. Install the Google Now Launcher The first and most important step is to download and install the Google Now Launcher. This will replace the basic UI on your phone with the same one that runs on Google Nexus devices. In other words, it gives the boot to Samsung's Touchwiz, Huawei's Emotion UI, HTC's Sense UI, and others. Your home screen becomes uncluttered, gets a slim Google search bar at the top, and gives you quick access to Google Now with a swipe right. Image: Jason Hiner/TechRepublic 2. Install the Google Keyboard The second most important thing to making your Android device feel like a Nexus is to replace your vendor's keyboard with the Google Keyboard. Not only does this make your device look and feel more like a Nexus, but you get access to swiping gestures, Google's auto-complete powered by machine learning, and one of the most effective software keyboards you can use. 3. Install Google native apps and change your defaults Your non-Nexus phone also defaults to a lot of vendor specific apps for key functions. Replace these with the Google versions and make them the default. For example, replace your text messaging app with Google Messages. Replace your calendar app with Google Calendar. Go to the Google Inc. page in the Play Store to see all of the native Android apps that Google offers. In addition to Google's native Android apps already mentioned, here are some others that are worth a look: Google Duo Google Photos Snapseed Google Hangouts Android Pay Google Translate Google Handwriting Input Google Clock Google Street View Google Earth Google Analytics Google Keep Google Cardboard Google Fit Google Wallet Hands Free One Today YouTube Alright, that's it. You just turned your Android phone into a Nexus for free. Okay, you don't get the quick updates to the latest version of Android like you do with a Nexus, but these steps will give you the next best thing—that pure Google experience on Android.

New medical bombshell as media scorch health critics as new 'birthers' Published: 08/23/2016 at 9:06 PM Bob Unruh About | Email | Archive Bob Unruh joined WND in 2006 after nearly three decades with the Associated Press, as well as several Upper Midwest newspapers, where he covered everything from legislative battles and sports to tornadoes and homicidal survivalists. He is also a photographer whose scenic work has been used commercially. Subscribe to feed Share on Facebook Share on Twitter ShareEmail  Print Democratic Party nominee Hillary Clinton (Photo: Twitter) Hillary Clinton has had a “serious concussion,” falls, double vision and other health episodes, causing great concern for her physical health – and now it’s been revealed that one of her top aides extensively researched a drug used to treat Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s diseases. While he worked for her at the State Department, Clinton Deputy Chief of Staff Jake Sullivan investigated the drug Provigil, according to an October 2011 emails sent to Clinton. In one email, Sullivan tells Clinton the military administers Provigil, a drug that’s also used to treat narcolepsy and sleep-wake disorders. “Provigil is used to treat excessive sleepiness caused by narcolepsy or shift work sleep disorder (sleepiness during scheduled waking hours among people who work at night or on rotating shifts),” Sullivan wrote in a prior email, according to the Daily Caller. He said doctors often prescribe Provigil to treat “excessive sleepiness in patients with Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s and multiple sclerosis.” Sullivan further explained that Modafinil, a generic name for the drug, “gained attention in the medical community because it is the first effective stimulant with no significant potential for abuse” and “it can be used for two to three day stretches at a time, with few known side effects and little risk of addiction.” One of Sullivan’s emails to Clinton: If the latest headlines are any indicator, many Americans appear to have questions about the health of the woman who could be America’s next president. According to CNN, if you do have those questions, you’re a “conspiracy theorist.” And a “healther.” On Tuesday, CNN launched a defense of Clinton in light of the many questions that have been raised simply by her appearance, her behavior and her actions. But never mind whether the progressives lash out with a label, because there’s a troupe out in Hollywood making sure she knows the fastest way to the hospital, putting “Hillary” signs next to all the local directions to hospitals. The Gateway Pundit posted some of the images. CNN, meanwhile, posed a long list of questions about Donald Trump’s health, poking fun at a doctor’s report that said he is strong and has a high level of stamina. Then the network took off on a tangent, labeling those with questions about Clinton “healthers.” CNN said they “are using junk science and conspiracy theories to argue that Clinton is suffering from a series of debilitating brain injuries.” “There is absolutely no credible evidence to backstop any of these claims,” CNN claimed. The “Stop Hillary” campaign is on fire! Join the surging response to this theme: “Clinton for prosecution, not president” Just one day earlier, amid increasing speculation about her health, Clinton sought to reassure voters in an appearance on “Jimmy Kimmel Live,” opening a jar of pickles and telling the host, “Take my pulse … make sure I’m alive.” Questions have been raised about her health for years, with reports of a concussion, fainting, falling, uncontrolled coughing, blood clots, six-month recovery periods and episodes of losing focus. The speculation surged during her campaign for the Democratic Party nomination and has only increased since her party’s convention. She has admitted to suffering a “serious concussion,” and husband Bill Clinton once spoke of a six-month recovery period after a health episode. On Monday, she was on comedian Jimmy Kimmel’s television show joking about the very serious issue of the health of a woman who would be president. It was a reprieve, however, from the new evidence that the Clinton Foundation was a “pay-for-play” operation that gave donors access to the State Department while she was secretary of state. What do YOU think of Hillary’s record now? Sound off in today’s WND poll On the Kimmel show, Clinton said, “Take my pulse, while I’m talking to you – make sure I’m alive.” Kimmel quipped, “Oh my God, there’s nothing there!” The host also had her open a jar of pickles to prove “she’s not on death’s door.” Former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, however, doubled down on his worries about her health. “I think Hillary is tired. I do,” Giuliani said in an interview on “Fox and Friends” Monday. “When I saw Hillary at the press conference sitting down with a Hillary supporting police chief pretending she is pro-police. It is one of the most pathetic press conferences I’ve ever seen. Well, first of all, she looks sick. Number two, she looks completely uncomfortable saying anything pro-police.” And another prominent doctor expressed concern. Bob Lahita, a professor of medicine at Rutgers, told Fox Business, “The very fact that she’s having these [blood] clots and she’s had two bouts of thrombosis is disconcerting to say the least. Related articles (story continues below): Hillary’s State-sponsored graft racket exposed Hillary helped crooked businessman get $10 million for Haiti scam Did Hillary really drive Vincent Foster to suicide? Hillary health critics the new ‘birthers “You go back to the history of our presidents and we’ve had many presidents up until Lyndon Johnson who’ve concealed their health during their campaigns, and it had dire effects for our country, going from Kennedy to Roosevelt, to Woodrow Wilson whose wife ran the White House for some time – so we have issues here and I think both candidates should be very forthcoming and perhaps have an impartial panel of physicians review the data and make that kind of decision before Americans go to the polls,” remarked Lahita. And it was revealed that several years ago, at a time when Clinton suffered a concussion, her adviser Philippe Reines contacted the NFL for information about severe head injuries. Later, Clinton thanked Reines for his help, stating, “Having a cracked head is no fun at all.” A tech writer for the New York Times has called on Google to hide evidence of Clinton’s “failing health.” That was after Giuliani said “all you gotta do is go online” to find out she is not well. Meanwhile, the Drudge Report on Monday highlighted a less-than-flattering image of Clinton with the headline “Excellent Health.” The Clinton campaign hasn’t addressed her health with documentation since 2015 when it released a statement from internist Lisa Bardack concluding she was in good health. It was Breitbart News that reported New York Times tech columnist Farhad Manjoo wants Google to hide the evidence. “Google should fix this. It shouldn’t give quarter to conspiracy theories,” he wrote. Only a couple days earlier, the Clinton campaign lashed out at the publication of videos and the images suggesting she is unwell, calling the reports “deranged conspiracy theories.” Dr. Jane Orient of the American Association of Physicians and Surgeons had bluntly asked, “Is Hillary Clinton medically unfit to serve?” She has recommended a thorough independent assessment of Clinton’s health. And a video shows many others are raising similar questions. WND has reported a wide range of concern over Clinton’s health. The “Stop Hillary” campaign is on fire! Join the surging response to this theme: “Clinton for prosecution, not president” Television doctor Dr. Drew Pinsky, for example, was on KABC’s “McIntyre in the Morning” radio show to discuss Clinton’s medical records. He and another physician found reason for “concern.” “Both of us concluded that if we were providing the care she was receiving, we would be ashamed to show up in a doctor’s lounge,” Drew told the show’s hosts. “We would be laughed out. She’s receiving sort of 1950s-level care by our evaluation.” Gerard Gianoli, M.D., a member of the American Association of Physicians and Surgeons, or AAPS, argued that if the concerns were about Donald Trump’s health, establishment media would spotlight the issue. He wrote: Imagine, if you would, that tomorrow Donald Trump suffers a concussion. Suppose he trips on a flight of stairs, falling down and hitting his head. The head injury is so severe that he is unconscious for a time and has to be hospitalized for a week. After getting out of the hospital, the Trump campaign tells us that he has fully recovered and that there are no lingering effects of the head trauma. During the following weeks, he is seen in public to wear glasses with a Fresnel lens on one side. He also seems to have trouble maintaining his balance, loses his thoughts in the middle of speeches, and has episodes of spasmodic movements suggestive of seizures. In this imaginary scenario, would it surprise anyone if the media became skeptical and pressed for release of Mr. Trump’s medical records? Would it surprise anyone if the Clinton campaign made an issue of Mr. Trump’s health status during speeches and in TV ads? Would the media cry ‘foul’ over the Clinton campaign doing so? I think the answers to these questions are self-evident. The media and the Clinton campaign would be all over this like white on rice, and no one would question the appropriateness of their actions. To my knowledge, Mr. Trump has had no such issues with his health. However, Mrs. Clinton has had multiple problems – some she has revealed and some that she has not revealed. Gianoli, in private practice in Covington, Louisiana, and a faculty member at Tulane University School of Medicine, has pioneered treatments in his specialty areas. He has been granted the American Academy of Otolaryngology’s Honor Award, among others. Gianoli was pointed in asking: “What do we know about Mrs. Clinton’s health? We know that she has suffered two deep vein thromboses and an episode of cerebral venous thrombosis. Blood spontaneously clotting within one’s veins on three separate occasions is not a good thing. In fact, it is life-threatening. This tells us that she has a hypercoagulable state requiring the use of Coumadin (a ‘blood thinner’) for the rest of her life to try to prevent this from happening again. While Coumadin may prevent future blood clots, it can also lead to life-threatening hemorrhage if she has any future trauma.” He added: “We also know that she suffered a concussion and, according to her husband, she took 6 months to recover. How do we know she recovered? If she was a high school athlete, she would have had mandatory neuropsychological testing before being allowed to participate in sports again. Given that being the leader of the free world is more important than playing goalie for the local high school, why is the mainstream media not demanding to see Mrs. Clinton’s post-concussion testing?” He noted her own supporters have talked about her “right transverse venous sinus thrombosis … a blood clot that formed in one of the two major veins that drain blood from the brain.” The symptoms are “headaches, visual problems, and dizziness/balance problems.” “We know that Ms. Clinton has had all three of these. Less commonly known are ‘brain fog,’ problems with concentration, and short-term memory problems. Sounds familiar?” he questioned. Orient said the evidence is there for people to review. “There’s the photograph of Secretary Clinton’s difficulty walking up some steps. Now inability to climb stairs does not necessarily disqualify a person for public office. However, neither she nor people with her apparently anticipated a problem. The people helping her seem to be preventing a fall. Did she simply trip? Or was it a seizure or a stroke? “Videos widely circulated on the Internet are, if authentic, very concerning. One shows prolonged, inappropriate laughter; another, strange head movements. In a third, she appeared momentarily dazed and confused, and lost her train of thought. Reportedly, she has a volcanic temper. (This is probably not new),” Orient wrote. The “Stop Hillary” campaign is on fire! Join the surging response to this theme: “Clinton for prosecution, not president” The incident in which Clinton needed help going up stairs happened during a February event in South Carolina. There also have been videos that have raised questions. One appears to show her losing her concentration while speaking. She simply comes to a halt and stares at the audience. See the video: And a July 21 video posted on YouTube shows Clinton’s head suddenly turning and shaking vigorously for several seconds. Blogger Jim Hoft of the Gateway Pundit headlined it, “Wow!” Did Hillary Clinton Just Suffer a Seizure on Camera?” “The poor woman is in worse shape than we thought,” he wrote. Fox News medical “A-Team” also raised questions. Dr. Marc Siegel noted: “In 2008 … I looked over a thousand pages of John McCain’s records because of a melanoma he had 10 years ago. What about Hillary? In 2009, a severe fall. She breaks her elbow. In 2011, she boards a plane, falls. In 2012, she has a severe concussion which Bill Clinton says took her six months to recover from.” He continued: “Then she ends up with a blood clot in the brain and a lifetime of blood thinners. Just that point alone – if she’s prone to falling, you can see from that picture up there that it looked like she can barely get upstairs without two people carrying her. Guess what if she falls and hits her head? She’ll get a blood clot.” And Dr. David Samadi added: “The picture going up the stairs speaks a million words. Is she fatigued? Is she dehydrated? One of the main reasons she fell in 2012 and had the concussions was severe dehydration. They’re holding her and going up the stairs. So she may be really dehydrated, she may have arthritis, she may have back pain, she may have fallen again. We don’t know.” Click here for reuse options!

Sources have told Bloomberg that Google is funding 360-degree videos from YouTube celebrities like Justine Ezarik, known as iJustine, and is spending "hundreds of thousands of dollars apiece" on various VR content and apps. This isn’t necessarily surprising, as Google already announced a number of games and apps for Daydream during its reveal at Google IO this spring. Video platform Hulu will have a presence on Daydream, as will IMAX, the NBA, and major game companies like Ubisoft. Google will reportedly spend a "high six figures" on video games, and smaller amounts for films, which are made using Google’s Jump 360-degree video platform. It’s not totally clear how much of this funding goes to projects that will be exclusive to Daydream, when YouTube already hosts 360-degree videos that can be watched on a phone or desktop computer. Hulu is reportedly timing some pieces for release when Daydream launches, but they won’t be exclusively available on the platform. Daydream is Google’s attempt at a ubiquitous VR platform built into the Android mobile ecosystem. Most of Google’s major mobile partners have pledged to build Daydream-compatible phones, which will meet certain standards and can be clipped into special Daydream headsets in a manner similar to Samsung’s Gear VR. Apps will work with a small, handheld motion controller, which will be included with headsets. So far, Google has released only a reference design for these headsets, seen above. While Daydream isn’t here yet, developers can get a taste of its capabilities through Android Nougat, and Google has previously said that it will launch sometime this fall.

But if for some reason you might want to start completely fresh and install one of the factory images that Google provides, we’re here to help you do that. If you have the Nexus 5X, Nexus 6P, Nexus 6, Nexus 9, Nexus Player, or Pixel C (or the General Mobile 4G Android One device), there’s a fresh build of Android 7.0 Nougat now — or soon — available for you to install. Be warned however, as this process might be a bit overwhelming if you’re not familiar with using a command line. If that doesn’t sway you, keep reading… Note: This guide assumes you already have your phone’s bootloader unlocked and the ADB tools installed on your computer. If you need the ADB tools, head over and download the Android SDK, and if you need to unlock your bootloader, keep reading. Before we get started, we need to make sure that your device is visible to your computer. Type the command “adb devices” in your Terminal application; if you see your device listed, you’re ready to go. If not, make sure your device has ADB debugging turned on. Unlock the bootloader If you know that your device is already unlocked, feel free to skip this section and keep reading. Otherwise, you need to make sure your phone’s bootloader is unlocked before you can flash a factory image. Bootloader locking is a security feature that requires that your device be completely wiped when going from a “locked” state to an “unlocked” state. For this reason, there’s no way to keep your data if your bootloader is locked (unless you’re going through the new Android Beta program). If you need to unlock your bootloader, go to the Settings app and head to the “Developer options” (if you don’t see Developer options, go to the “About” page and tap the Android build number several times). Make sure that “OEM unlocking” is checked. Next, Use the command “adb reboot bootloader” to go to the device’s bootloader and check if your device is in the locked state. If the bootloader on your Nexus device is locked, make sure your device is at the bootloader screen and use the “fastboot oem unlock” command. After this, you should see some prompts on your device to confirm that you do indeed want to unlock your bootloader. After you confirm this, your device is going to be completely wiped and you’ll be ready to move on with this guide. Download and prepare the factory image If you haven’t already, grab the latest build of Android Nougat from Google’s factory image page. Once you’ve downloaded the .tgz file, extract it. Inside the extracted .tgz file there will be a .zip file titled something like “image-volantis-nrd90m.zip” (Nexus 9), and after you extract that file, you’ll find the boot loader, OS image, vendor image, and a radio image (depending on your device).  Optional: modify the “flash-all” script to save your data You only need to follow these instructions if you want to keep your data, otherwise the flash will format your device and all data will be lost. If your bootloader is locked, your data will have to be wiped anyway in the unlocking process as described above. If you don’t want to lose your data in this case, you need to restart your device and back it up manually. Note: It’s worth mentioning that modifying the flash-all script to save your data can sometimes have weird effects on your device as it leaves some code from your previous OS version untouched that can conflict with new code from the new factory image. It’s always better to just install fresh if you can. The “flash-all” script contains all of the commands necessary to flash the factory image onto your device. Before running it from the command line, you might want to remove the flag that wipes your data (although this isn’t ideal, you might run into problems especially if it’s a major upgrade). In the file you extracted you’ll find two flash-all scripts as mentioned above. The flash-all script with the .bat extension works with the Windows command line while the .sh extension works with the Unix command line (OSX, Linux, etc). Open up the proper flash-all script with your favorite text editor and remove the “-w” from the file. “-w” is an ADB flag which wipes all of the user data (the stuff we want to keep). Once you’ve made the change, save your file, and open up a command line program. Run the script and install Android N As we did earlier to check unlock status, you need to boot into your bootloader to flash the factory image. Run the command “adb reboot bootloader” again to get there. Alternatively, you could start up the device while holding the volume down and power keys simultaneously to boot into the bootloader. Now point your command line to the file directory with the flash-all script. (Ex: cd /Users/<yourusername>/Downloads/hammerhead-lrx21o). For more help on using the command line, see this cheat sheet. Once you’ve pointed to the correct directory, run your script. On Unix/Mac, run “./flash-all.sh” On Windows, run “flash-all.bat” Now you should see the script running on-screen. It’ll take a little over five minutes for the image to install. Once the image is installed, the script will automatically reboot your phone. The first boot usually takes a while, so wait about 10 minutes before assuming you’ve entered a bootloop. Note: Some users have had issues with the flash-all script not working on the Nexus 6 and other devices in the past. If that’s the case with you, you’re going to need to flash all of the images manually. It’s not a hard process, and only requires a few extra steps. Make sure your device is in the proper bootloader state, and then follow these instructions: First, flash the bootloader and the radio, and then reboot the bootloader (radio only applies to some devices): fastboot flash bootloader <bootloader file name here>.img fastboot flash radio <radio file name here>.img fastboot reboot-bootloader Flash the recovery, boot, system, and vendor images (vendor only applies to the Nexus 9): fastboot flash recovery recovery.img fastboot flash boot boot.img fastboot flash system system.img fastboot flash vendor vendor.img Recommended: For a full wipe, flash cache and userdata as well (userdata only applies to some devices): fastboot flash cache cache.img fastboot flash userdata userdata.img Reboot your device: fastboot reboot After the phone boots, you should have Android 7.0 Nougat and, if you opted to modify the flash-all script, all of your data should be intact.

Google Posts Factory Images for Android 7.0 Nougat The images are available for Nexus smartphones Aug 23, 2016 15:58 GMT  ·  By Alexandra Vaidos  ·  Share:  Google started the roll out of Android 7.0 Nougat final version yesterday and it's expected to arrive to smartphones in the coming weeks. However, users who don't wish to wait until the update hits their phones, can go over to Android developers website and get factory images. The factory images are available for Nexus smartphones, like Nexus 5X, Nexus 6P, Nexus 6, Nexus 9, Nexus Player and Pixel C. In the next period of time, Google will also provide factory images for Android One and Nexus 9 LTE. Google provided download links to the same OTAs that will be rolling soon for smartphone owners that already have the Android Developer Preview 4, but want a faster update. Flashing a factory image to a device means that all data will be wiped so users should take that into consideration before starting the process. Users should back data to their Google Account and keep in mind that apps and all associated data will be uninstalled. With Android 7.0 Nougat, Google launched seamless updates that would download and install in the background. This means that users no longer need to restart their phones every time they receive an update on their Nexus devices. This would mean that updates will be made faster and in a seamless way. Another neat thing about Nougat is that it will be receiving quarterly maintenance updates and developer previews will also be released, the next one to come with fall. #Google#Android 7.0 Nougat#Factory Images#Nexus 6#Nexus 9 reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Android 7.0 Nougat to Receive Quarterly Maintenance Updates Google Confirms LG V20 As The First New Smartphone With Android Nougat Android 7.0 Nougat Starts Official Rollout to Nexus Devices Android 7.0 Nougat to Arrive on August 22 - Rumor iPhone 8 to Feature Traditional Wireless Charging like the Samsung Galaxy S7 Lenovo Builds a New Microsoft Surface Clone and It Looks Fabulous Anonymous Hackers Want McAfee to Be Trump’s Security Adviser, Call for March Hackers Could Infect Headphones to Spy on You The LG V20 Has Been Successfully Rooted Galaxy S6 and S7 Owners Complain About Samsung’s Stock Email App Facebook Is Testing a New Snapchat-like Camera Feature Google Adds Stranger Things Stickers to Allo, New Themes to Arrive Soon    Android 7.0 Nougat new android apps VivaVideo APK: Updated November 23rd, 14:19 GMT PowerDirector APK: Updated November 23rd, 14:08 GMT WeVideo APK: Updated November 23rd, 14:04 GMT Amazon Rapids APK: Updated November 23rd, 14:02 GMT ActionDirector APK: Updated November 23rd, 13:58 GMT DataEye APK: Updated November 23rd, 13:46 GMT JOOX APK: Updated November 23rd, 13:46 GMT Reader comments Don't Install Note 7 ROMs on Previous Models, Samsung Could Limit Battery Charge more on: Galaxy Note 7 i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2016 Softpedia.

Now, Google has started posting the factory images for compatible Nexus devices. Surprisingly, not all the capable devices have seen the update yet, as the Factory Images landing page only features the download for the following: Pixel C (NRD90M) Nexus 9 Wi-Fi (NRD90M) Nexus Player (NRD90M) The Nexus 6, Nexus 5X, and Nexus 6P still have yet to see the factory image download, but we’re sure it’s just a matter of time. In the mean time, be sure to check out everything that’s new in Android 7.0 Nougat, including the new emoji’s that have come with Unicode 9.0. If you want to get your supported device up to date, head to the Google Developers page to download the appropriate Factory Image. Remember to follow the flashing instructions to the “T” to avoid any risks or boot-loops while trying to update your device before Google starts seeding.

It looks smooth and makes several improvements, but does it actually matter? Most Android users won’t see this update for quite some time, as Android updates typically have a very slow adoption rate,” Kevin Fulmer writes for Seeking Alpha. “Half of Android users are running their devices on software from 2013 or earlier. Prior to 7.0, only 15.2% of users operate on the most current system, Marshmallow. ” “On the other hand, Apple has been overwhelmingly successful in converting its users to software updates,” Fulmer writes. “As of August 15th, 87% of iOS users were on the latest iOS 9 update. Another 10% aren’t far behind and operate on iOS 8. Only 3% operate their devices on previous models.” “Because Google has to pass through a middleman in the form of phone manufacturers, its software updates aren’t even available to many users for months after launch. As a result, five months after Marshmallow (6.0) was launched, a mere 2.3% of Android users had the update installed on their device,” Fulmer writes. “With so many people on so many outdated software models, Google has to devote significant resources towards developing updates and security patches to the outdated models. Not only does this divert resources away from growing the business and creating new technology, it’s impractical on a security standpoint.” “This is the conclusion that Google came to. It announced in 2015 that it would no longer offer security fixes to anyone running 4.3 or earlier… This equates to 20.1% of Android users that are left to fend for themselves. Translation: 1/5 of Android devices are horrendously vulnerable to any new threats,” Fulmer writes. “Google’s problems are Apple’s catalysts… If just 4% of the fifth of users that are exposed end up switching to Apple as a result of a breach (and this would be a conservative estimate in my opinion), the result would equate to 15 million new Apple customers. Considering that Apple shipped 40 million iPhones in Q3, this would deliver a healthy increase in sales to the tech giant.” Read more in the full article here. MacDailyNews Take: We don’t call Fragmandroid “the gift that keeps on giving” for nothing. If it’s a poor man’s iPhone, it’s a poor man’s iPhone. Now to be fair, this is only because Android is an inferior product peddled to cheapskate tech illiterates who do not value their privacy and/or who are unable to recognize a half-assed knockoff from the revolutionary original. Android is a BlackBerry clone that was hastily rejiggered by Google at the last minute to mimic Apple’s revolutionary iPhone. Obviously, mistakes were made and corners were cut. So, the Android rush-job is a privacy and security nightmare. It’s a fragmented morass. It’s too many cooks in the kitchen. It’s crap-by-committee, lowest-common-denominator junk.

Voice of reason Tuesday, August 23, 2016 - 11:51 am · Reply You don’t seem to understand what fud is… We as long time Apple users are very familiar with it. Fud is a misrepresentation, or a lie that is used to sew fear uncertainty and doubt. What fud is not, is reporting actual facts and issues with a product or platform. And since we in the “cult” as you may call it, now have a 30 years track record of being right, and a massive user base which is unaffected by security problems, all of the old lies about Apple are debunked and and only live on in stubborn anti Apple people. But, facts about platform fragmentation and the security nightmare that android and windows are, is not fud…. That’s the truth, and if you don’t like it you can hide your head in the sand while someone steals all of your personal info. peterblood71 Tuesday, August 23, 2016 - 12:27 pm · Reply Well said, and funny too. Hilarious this AnR (Asinine ‘n Ridiculous) pot calling the kettle black, when it’s actually white. spyintheskyuk Wednesday, August 24, 2016 - 4:53 am · Reply One might have thought that he would offer up evidence that this claim was actually wrong, otherwise the term FUD would of course simply apply to his own comment. Clearly he doesn’t have the intellectual capacity to see the irony in that misuse. But then he is an Android user I guess. Really Tuesday, August 23, 2016 - 11:48 am · Reply I’ve resorted to considering an android device to be a device that will only run the version of the OS that it shipped with. Don’t expect to update and don’t store any important information on one! That is the only sensible way to look at it. killerz Tuesday, August 23, 2016 - 1:47 pm · Reply that said, if you update an idevice that’s more than 2 or 3 generations off the latest, its not optimized for the CPU and memory usage of the older device and often runs noticeably slower (lag). So, there’s still a trade off between latest security/features and a usable device. But at least you have a choice. lemmy Tuesday, August 23, 2016 - 5:34 pm · Reply Mostly sensible, except that using an internet device filled with personal information without any recent security updates is a bit reckless in this day and age. New internet security issues are frequently discovered and patched. At least 4 known vulnerabilities dealing with standard web encryption were discovered in the last couple years that effected nearly every internet device. Those with the latest updates are now patched, but everyone who hasn’t updated since 2015 is wide open to these known flaws in web security. Mike Tuesday, August 23, 2016 - 12:33 pm · Reply It is interesting how users have been brainwashed into thinking that routine software updates are absolutely necessary. If the software is good from the start, then a minimal number of updates are critical. Sure, Google ware is probably buggier than Apple on average, but it’s not like an iOS user can explain what each update does for his iPhone. As for the Mac, the last 5 years have been iOSification and bloat, not improvement. For many uses and users, updating would be a waste of time. We still have a G4 TiBook running OS X 10.4 serving a photo wall, and an old Mac Pro running OS X 10.6 serving up home videos. There is no incentive to update either one with new OS until the hardware dies. peterblood71 Tuesday, August 23, 2016 - 12:39 pm · Reply Spoken like a justifying double-talk Android owner. Really Tuesday, August 23, 2016 - 2:19 pm · Reply I agree if we talking about new features. Where things go off the rails is when there is a security exploit and you are stuck with a vulnerable device. The only options are to root (if possible), live with it or toss it. peterblood71 Tuesday, August 23, 2016 - 12:38 pm · Reply HAH! Someone reported on Verge that Samsung’s very latest Galaxy Note 7 (don’t drop it cuz it will break!) can’t even run Googles Android OS latest “Nougat”! A big fat & hearty cruel chuckle here. What a mess of a fragmented ecosystem, getting worse at every implementation and Google is at the mercy of manufacturer’s – rueing that day much Google? Fandroid love the snake oil and ignoring the man standing behind the curtain.

But then I’m a blind user who requires accessibility stuff, which Apple has been content with just letting coast and ride on its own momentum. Not a good sign. Billybobby Tuesday, August 23, 2016 - 9:33 pm · Reply I own a bunch of Apple products. But I don’t understand the arrogance of Apple fans. When I look at Apple today, I see the late 80’s to middle 90’s all over again. Just on a much bigger scale. Ahmad Syarbini Thursday, August 25, 2016 - 8:28 am · Reply At this point, why does Google has to update Android? The users has enough access privileges that they can release their own update. you know, because of “open”ness.

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Erik Wemple August 23 Follow @ErikWemple Donald Trump speaks in June in Manchester, N.H. (Jim Cole/Associated Press)   The Internet yields various ways to search for the most critical journalism on a guy like Donald Trump. You can search on Google, set up a Google Alert, launch a search on Twitter, filter TV transcripts. Or you can just check out the Twitter feed of Trump himself. In the space of just more than a week, Trump has alerted his followers to tough coverage in the New York Times, MSNBC and, now, The Post: The @WashingtonPost quickly put together a hit job book on me- comprised of copies of some of their inaccurate stories. Don't buy, boring! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 23, 2016 For those followers who want more information on what not to buy, here’s the opus to which Trump is referring: “Trump Revealed: An American Journey of Ambition, Ego, Money, and Power.” Its authors are Michael Kranish and Marc Fisher of The Post, and it relies in toto on the reporting of 24 Post reporters. The contract for the book is between the publisher, Scribner, and The Post. That would be the same Post to which the Trump campaign has denied credentials for covering his rallies and other events. Don’t get the idea, however, that Trump’s distaste for The Post is consistent and rational: For the “Trump Revealed” book, Trump sat for more than 20 hours of interviews with the co-authors — a considerable time investment into a product that he would later blast on Twitter. In a book excerpt published earlier this month, Kranish and Fisher note that in one session, Trump waved off his secretary’s attempt to wrap up. “Let’s keep going — this is a lot of fun,” said Trump. There is no making sense of this fellow. “I don’t think he could have helped himself but to do that,” said Fisher of Trump’s tweet. “He can’t restrain himself and from his perspective it would probably have been smarter to ignore” the book. “I would expect by now our publisher will have sent a huge fruit basket over to the Trump campaign.” Via pique and pettiness, Trump has amassed more than 11 million Twitter followers. “It’s advertising you can’t buy,” said Fisher. Just how Trump managed to abridge the 450-page book is an open question. Fisher said that Trump didn’t receive an advance copy, so he “could not have read it even if he was inclined to do so.” Inclination is minimal, as the reporting duo discovered. Though he watches a lot of television, Trump said he doesn’t have the time to read much. Today is the book’s publication date. The Erik Wemple Blog is reluctant to believe that a major-party presidential nominee would publicly characterize a book without first having read it. Facts suggest otherwise. Trump sued author Timothy O’Brien over his book “TrumpNation: The Art of Being the Donald” even though he hadn’t read the thing. Fisher said that Trump indicates that he “heard it was a bad book — people say it was a bad book.” In any case, Trump’s tweet could well redound to the financial benefit of a news outlet that he has delighted in pounding. “He’s very kindly spreading the word,” said Fisher.   opinions erik-wemple Orlando Shooting Updates News and analysis on the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history. post_newsletter348 follow-orlando true endOfArticle false Please provide a valid email address.

It looks smooth and makes several improvements, but does it actually matter? Most Android users won’t see this update for quite some time, as Android updates typically have a very slow adoption rate,” Kevin Fulmer writes for Seeking Alpha. “Half of Android users are running their devices on software from 2013 or earlier. Prior to 7.0, only 15.2% of users operate on the most current system, Marshmallow. ” “On the other hand, Apple has been overwhelmingly successful in converting its users to software updates,” Fulmer writes. “As of August 15th, 87% of iOS users were on the latest iOS 9 update. Another 10% aren’t far behind and operate on iOS 8. Only 3% operate their devices on previous models.” “Because Google has to pass through a middleman in the form of phone manufacturers, its software updates aren’t even available to many users for months after launch. As a result, five months after Marshmallow (6.0) was launched, a mere 2.3% of Android users had the update installed on their device,” Fulmer writes. “With so many people on so many outdated software models, Google has to devote significant resources towards developing updates and security patches to the outdated models. Not only does this divert resources away from growing the business and creating new technology, it’s impractical on a security standpoint.” “This is the conclusion that Google came to. It announced in 2015 that it would no longer offer security fixes to anyone running 4.3 or earlier… This equates to 20.1% of Android users that are left to fend for themselves. Translation: 1/5 of Android devices are horrendously vulnerable to any new threats,” Fulmer writes. “Google’s problems are Apple’s catalysts… If just 4% of the fifth of users that are exposed end up switching to Apple as a result of a breach (and this would be a conservative estimate in my opinion), the result would equate to 15 million new Apple customers. Considering that Apple shipped 40 million iPhones in Q3, this would deliver a healthy increase in sales to the tech giant.” Read more in the full article here. MacDailyNews Take: We don’t call Fragmandroid “the gift that keeps on giving” for nothing. If it’s a poor man’s iPhone, it’s a poor man’s iPhone. Now to be fair, this is only because Android is an inferior product peddled to cheapskate tech illiterates who do not value their privacy and/or who are unable to recognize a half-assed knockoff from the revolutionary original. Android is a BlackBerry clone that was hastily rejiggered by Google at the last minute to mimic Apple’s revolutionary iPhone. Obviously, mistakes were made and corners were cut. So, the Android rush-job is a privacy and security nightmare. It’s a fragmented morass. It’s too many cooks in the kitchen. It’s crap-by-committee, lowest-common-denominator junk.

AnR Tuesday, August 23, 2016 - 11:37 am · Reply This site should be called FUDDailyNews. Voice of reason Tuesday, August 23, 2016 - 11:51 am · Reply You don’t seem to understand what fud is… We as long time Apple users are very familiar with it. Fud is a misrepresentation, or a lie that is used to sew fear uncertainty and doubt. What fud is not, is reporting actual facts and issues with a product or platform. And since we in the “cult” as you may call it, now have a 30 years track record of being right, and a massive user base which is unaffected by security problems, all of the old lies about Apple are debunked and and only live on in stubborn anti Apple people. But, facts about platform fragmentation and the security nightmare that android and windows are, is not fud…. That’s the truth, and if you don’t like it you can hide your head in the sand while someone steals all of your personal info. peterblood71 Tuesday, August 23, 2016 - 12:27 pm · Reply Well said, and funny too. Hilarious this AnR (Asinine ‘n Ridiculous) pot calling the kettle black, when it’s actually white. spyintheskyuk Wednesday, August 24, 2016 - 4:53 am · Reply One might have thought that he would offer up evidence that this claim was actually wrong, otherwise the term FUD would of course simply apply to his own comment. Clearly he doesn’t have the intellectual capacity to see the irony in that misuse. But then he is an Android user I guess. Really Tuesday, August 23, 2016 - 11:48 am · Reply I’ve resorted to considering an android device to be a device that will only run the version of the OS that it shipped with. Don’t expect to update and don’t store any important information on one! That is the only sensible way to look at it. killerz Tuesday, August 23, 2016 - 1:47 pm · Reply that said, if you update an idevice that’s more than 2 or 3 generations off the latest, its not optimized for the CPU and memory usage of the older device and often runs noticeably slower (lag). So, there’s still a trade off between latest security/features and a usable device. But at least you have a choice. lemmy Tuesday, August 23, 2016 - 5:34 pm · Reply Mostly sensible, except that using an internet device filled with personal information without any recent security updates is a bit reckless in this day and age. New internet security issues are frequently discovered and patched. At least 4 known vulnerabilities dealing with standard web encryption were discovered in the last couple years that effected nearly every internet device. Those with the latest updates are now patched, but everyone who hasn’t updated since 2015 is wide open to these known flaws in web security. Mike Tuesday, August 23, 2016 - 12:33 pm · Reply It is interesting how users have been brainwashed into thinking that routine software updates are absolutely necessary. If the software is good from the start, then a minimal number of updates are critical. Sure, Google ware is probably buggier than Apple on average, but it’s not like an iOS user can explain what each update does for his iPhone. As for the Mac, the last 5 years have been iOSification and bloat, not improvement. For many uses and users, updating would be a waste of time. We still have a G4 TiBook running OS X 10.4 serving a photo wall, and an old Mac Pro running OS X 10.6 serving up home videos. There is no incentive to update either one with new OS until the hardware dies. peterblood71 Tuesday, August 23, 2016 - 12:39 pm · Reply Spoken like a justifying double-talk Android owner. Really Tuesday, August 23, 2016 - 2:19 pm · Reply I agree if we talking about new features. Where things go off the rails is when there is a security exploit and you are stuck with a vulnerable device. The only options are to root (if possible), live with it or toss it. peterblood71 Tuesday, August 23, 2016 - 12:38 pm · Reply HAH! Someone reported on Verge that Samsung’s very latest Galaxy Note 7 (don’t drop it cuz it will break!) can’t even run Googles Android OS latest “Nougat”! A big fat & hearty cruel chuckle here. What a mess of a fragmented ecosystem, getting worse at every implementation and Google is at the mercy of manufacturer’s – rueing that day much Google? Fandroid love the snake oil and ignoring the man standing behind the curtain. Thief Tuesday, August 23, 2016 - 12:49 pm · Reply Biggest flaw is its STOLEN OS! russ Tuesday, August 23, 2016 - 1:20 pm · Reply Google’s next version of android is code named ‘chocolate sausage’ to better match actual resemblance of the end product i.e. a turd. dprater2014 Tuesday, August 23, 2016 - 4:36 pm · Reply My cheap Android tablet is a pretty good computer. But then I’m a blind user who requires accessibility stuff, which Apple has been content with just letting coast and ride on its own momentum. Not a good sign. Billybobby Tuesday, August 23, 2016 - 9:33 pm · Reply I own a bunch of Apple products. But I don’t understand the arrogance of Apple fans. When I look at Apple today, I see the late 80’s to middle 90’s all over again. Just on a much bigger scale. Ahmad Syarbini Thursday, August 25, 2016 - 8:28 am · Reply At this point, why does Google has to update Android? The users has enough access privileges that they can release their own update. you know, because of “open”ness.

What goodies and new features does Google's latest mobile OS have in store? And how will it change your phone? We've been putting the software to the test since March and here's what we've found. What you notice first about Nougat is how little there is to notice. Unlike Apple, Google doesn't update its main apps at the same time as its mobile OS, and the Material Design principles introduced in Android 5.0 Lollipop have only been given slight tweaks. Even Google Now gets updated independently of Android these days. That leaves the system settings, a bunch of under-the-hood tweaks, and a few extras (like emoji) as the main upgrades arriving with the seventh major Android version. Don't expect a massive difference after you've got the new software installed – at least on the surface – but it's well worth having nonetheless. Look and feel The ever-useful Quick Settings pane gets improved and can now be customized What visual flourishes there are, we like. Notifications are now grouped by app and look tidier on screen as well. There are other small touches, like quick info bars on the Settings page: You can see how much battery is left before tapping on the Battery menu, for instance, or what the ringer volume is set to before you go into the Sound menu. Notifications are easier to respond to as well – drag down on an alert to see quick responses added by the developer (you can reply in Hangouts and Archive in Gmail for example). There's a new Clear All button at the bottom if you want to dismiss the whole stack of notifications at once. Much as we like iOS as well, it feels like Android has notifications figured out better at the moment. There are a few small improvements like this, such as the fluid way the Quick Settings pane expands when you pull it down from the top. For the first time you can edit this pane yourself without any third-party apps or hidden system tweaks (or using customized versions of Android, like Samsung's), so you can choose which icons are shown and how they're arranged on screen. Notifications are grouped by app and take up more space to fit together better on screen Bear in mind we've been using the beta versions of Android 7.0 Nougat, and in most cases before any apps have been upgraded to match it, but even so the mobile OS has been a breeze to use on our Nexus 6, particular in the recent builds. Whatever Google is doing to make animations and actions snappier, it's working. One of the most notable new features is support for a split-screen view, accessed from the Overview (app switching) screen. It's going to be most useful for those on Android tablets, but even on the Nexus 6 it occasionally comes in handy: keeping two websites open at once, say, or making notes from an incoming message. A double-tap on the Overview/Recent Apps button switches back to your most recent app in Nougat, so flicking between two apps (the one you're using and the one you just left) is easier. It's another example of the small tweaks in Nougat that you're going to enjoy discovering, once the update finally lands on your phone. We found the double-tap shortcut to have much more use than the split-screen functionality, at least on our Nexus 6P. It's one of those small improvements that isn't going to raise a lot of eyebrows but makes an actual difference to how you get around the OS. Behind-the-scenes tweaks The OS is slightly more user-friendly than Android 6.0 Marshmallow and you get a reminder when your phone is silenced Beyond the immediately obvious, Google has improved battery performance again (it says) and battery life on our test device was at least on a par and perhaps slightly improved. Remember we were using pre-release versions of Nougat, without optimized apps, but the early results are promising and you should be able to eke out more life from your device. The Doze battery feature introduced with Marshmallow, where apps go into a low-power mode when your phone isn't being used, is now smart enough to work when your phone is in your pocket or a bag (in other words, not just when it's still). A new Data Saver tool has been added that lets you stop certain apps from sending and receiving data in the background. It's designed to help you while traveling abroad or if you're close to your data plan limit, though Android already had some comprehensive features in this area and the new update doesn't add much more. The addition of 72 new emoji takes the total in Android to more than 1,500 You will notice more emoji available – 72 new additions to be exact – which gives you that much more freedom if you like expressing yourself in little pictures as well as words. Emoji have to be added at the OS level, although the Google Keyboard used by default by Nougat is another of the apps that have been spun out of Android, and gets updated separately. Graphics performance has been improved with a new Vulkan engine designed to give games better access to the CPU horsepower in your phone. We weren't able to test this too extensively on our 2014 Nexus 6, but the games we did try certainly didn't get any worse: performance remained fluid and smooth throughout. Again, installing Nougat isn't going to make a huge difference to your phone in these areas, but they're another set of small steps forward that we've come to expect from Android updates. Longer battery life, better graphics and a little extra in the way of customization are all appreciated even if they're not spectacular upgrades. It all means your Nougat experience won't be much of a change from your Marshmallow one. Think of it as a tune-up for the car you've got rather than swapping it for a new one. Daydream VR and the Android future Split-screen support is one of the major new features – though how useful it is on a phone screen is debatable Android 7.0 Nougat also comes with the foundation of Google's new Daydream VR platform, which is essentially a set of graphics and hardware standards designed to power new mobile VR headsets. Daydream-ready phones are "coming later this year", Google says, so this won't make any difference to your current handset. One of the big features that arrived with last year's Android upgrade, Google Now on Tap, seems to have stagnated somewhat, and can be a bit hit and miss with its results. It is useful sometimes, for looking up info about what's on the screen, but there aren't many occasions when we feel the need to fire it up. More significant improvements in Google's AI software are set to arrive with its upcoming Allo messenger app and the Google Assistant intelligence underpinning it. The same Google Assistant – which seems to be a next-gen version of Google Now, although Google hasn't been very clear on that point – will also be arriving in the Google Home speaker launching later this year and the Allo messaging app which should be here before long. A bunch of clever, small tweaks have been added, but Android is about much more than just the base OS code these days There's another new feature worth mentioning, which is good news if you're on a Nexus: seamless background updates. Android will update itself in the background invisibly, much as Google Chrome does now on the desktop, but while that should make for a better user experience it flags up Android's continuing fragmentation problem. Nougat will arrive in the very near future to the Nexus 6, Nexus 5X, Nexus 6P, Nexus 9, Nexus Player, Pixel C and Android One, and it's going to come pre-installed on the upcoming LG V20. For everyone else, it could be a long, long waiting game: just 15.2 percent of handsets worldwide are on Android 6.0 Marshmallow to date. Based on our time with it, Android 7.0 Nougat makes a few pleasing tweaks to the look of Android, gives you a more stable and battery-friendly experience overall, and lays the foundations for what's coming next with Daydream VR and Google Assistant. What it also emphasizes is just how much lies beyond Android and iOS updates now. These major releases are no longer the feature-packed game-changers they once were, particularly on Android where the native apps remain untouched. There are still plenty of reasons to get Nougat installed as soon as you possibly can, but like Windows 10 this is now an OS that's going to continually improve and refine itself, little by little. You can read more about Android 7.0 Nougat in Google's official announcement.

The company has been innovating the markets like never before, and has been coming out with updates from time to time. While their latest efforts are towards the development and the rollout of the Android 7.0 Marshmallow OS over the next few weeks, they are also working on a new app. The app that we are talking about, as you might have guessed, is Google Allo. The company had announced two apps – Google Duo and Allo at the Google I/O 2016. While Google Duo came out a week ago, it is now time for the Google Allo to soon roll out. Google, with their upcoming apps, is working towards taking communication to the next level. In this effort, they have gone head to head with many major names in the markets. Google is all set to face major competition from names such as WhatsApp, Snapchat and Skype. Talking about Skype, the Google Allo is all set to have a feature which looks like it is borrowed straight from Snapchat! The popular chat app, Snapchat is already under a lot of pressure, as Facebook has been coming out with many new features which are highly Snapchat-inspired. The company is facing a tough time in the markets. The feature we talk about Allo borrowing from Snapchat is of the disappearing messages. Snapchat, since a long time, has had messages which tend to disappear after a user has viewed them. Similar to that, the Google Allo too, introduces an incognito mode. This information is obtained via Android Police, who have some images from those who are testing the developers version of the app. The Incognito mode of chat allows the users to set a time limit before the messages would disappear. The messages can be set to be visible for 5 seconds, 10 seconds, 30 seconds, 1 minute, 1 hour, 1 day, 1 week, or off. This is indeed an impressive feature that Google is introducing with their latest app. It is also to be kept in mind that all the conversations are end-to-end encrypted. Other than Snapchat, controversial chat app Telegram too, has had this feature for a while. Google is indeed taking inspirations from the best of the apps, and is combining them all under a single offering. What makes these incognito mode chats even more secure is the fact that the users cannot take screenshots! Incognito mode conversations would be marked with the logo of a man in a hat, similar to what has usually been a part of the Google Chrome incognito mode. Incognito chats too, will feature a blue background with the logo. Things are indeed looking interesting for Google Allo. Many other features of the app, too, have been observed in the past. These leaks have indicated that the app might feature some controversial stickers. In addition to that, it has also been noted that the app will feature an audio messaging system which is eerily similar to what WhatsApp currently offers. The app also allows the users to delete messages, unlike Hangouts, where the users have no choice but to delete entire conversations. As of this writing, there is no update on when the app will be coming out. However, it has been expected that it might release over the next few weeks. Google’s priority in the upcoming days is to ensure that the Android Nougat OS rolls out smoothly.

Daniel Robinson August 23, 2016 Google now has four apps in the mobile communications world, led by Hangouts and Messenger, and now there is Allo and Duo. One would be asking why Google is actually pushing to have as many apps in the mobile industry, which is already full of many other similar apps. However, there is probably a good reason the search engine giant has decided to add Google Allo and Google Duo to the list. Apparently, there is talk of Google Hangouts switching focus to cater more for the enterprise world, something that leaves room for the two new apps – Allo and Duo. But what of those who have grown fond of the current Google apps on their Android and iOS devices? Does it mean you give up one Hangouts app in favor of two Allo and Duo apps or will you keep them all? Let’s take a quick look at how Google Allo, Google Duo, and Google Hangouts stack up against each other. Google Hangouts Given the huge popularity of Android devices and the fact that Google Hangouts comes preinstalled on quite a huge number of these devices, many people are already familiar with this app. Along the way, the app has evolved into one of the most powerful communications platforms, be it for personal or business reasons. Whether you want to use it for SMS, instant messaging, or even video calling – Google Hangouts has your back. It gets even better with the app as it allows for continuity of conversations. This means that you can start a call on the mobile app and still switch to a PC or tablet without breaking the conversation. This application has also been integrated into Google’s productivity tools, among them Google Drive, Gmail, Google Docs, Google Sheets and so on, just like Microsoft does with Skype. To use Google Hangouts, you need an email address so as to create an account. The person on the other end must also be using the same platform for this to work. Google Allo Google Allo was unveiled at the I/O 2016 event back in May. According to the search engine giant, Allo is a simple messaging app that takes advantage of the AI-based Google Assistant to offer users the best of messaging services. Like many other messaging apps out there, Google Allo is tied to your phone number, however, the use of machine learning means that the app will get better and more suited to your needs with more usage. It learns your traits and ways of chatting, making it easy for the app to come up with regular Smart Reply suggestions based on how you responded to similar messages in the past. This app will also let users delete messages within a conversation, something that is not possible with Google Hangouts. Google Duo Another app that was also unveiled at the Google I/O 2016 is Duo. Unlike Allo, Google Duo is strictly meant for video calling services. The app is as simple as you can imagine, and it also ties itself to your phone number. This app offers the best in one-to-one video calls and it also comes with the famous end-to-end encryption for better security. Apparently, Google Duo app should also work with minimal drops in poor network connections. Despite its simplicity, Duo manages to pack a very interesting feature in the name of Knock Knock. This is where you will be able to see the surroundings of the person calling you even before you answer the call. So, which app should you turn to? This should depend on a number of things, but high on the list is what exactly you intend to use the app for. As noted earlier, business persons are better off with Google Hangouts. As for those interested in pure simplicity in the form of personal chats, Google Allo and Duo are a safe way to go. Google is expected to add voice calling services to Duo in the not-so-distant future.

Both apps are new following their arrival at the Google I/O 2016 developer conference. With Duo, it is all about video calling in the easiest and simplest way possible. The app lets you jump straight into a video call without going into any unnecessary hassles. As for Google Allo, it is strictly meant for messaging purposes, just like what you already have with Facebook’s WhatsApp. While WhatsApp adds voice calling to the already spectacular instant messaging services it offers, Allo has no promise of voice calling services, instead, it is Duo that could receive this update. Even though Google Allo has not been released, the beta version is out there in the wild and this has led us to a number of discoveries, especially when looking at Allo vs WhatsApp. Google Allo will let you message your friends in a variety of ways, be it via text, graphics, stickers, doodling photos or even voice messaging. In fact, the latter feature is the latest discovery that points towards similarities between Allo and WhatsApp. In addition to the fact that both apps are tied to one’s phone number and require that the other party have the same app installed on their phones, the voice messaging aspect of the two is also very similar. Just like WhatsApp, Google Allo’s voice messaging feature allows users to press and hold on the mic icon to begin recording a message. Letting this icon go will immediately send the recorded message to the intended recipient. Dragging your finger towards the left of the open window will cancel the message that you are currently recording. Even though this is very similar to what happens with WhatsApp, Google Allo is still in beta and it is possible that this UI could change once the public version is released. Don’t be quick to write off Google Allo just because it has some major similarities with WhatsApp. The app betters its counterpart thanks to the fact that it comes baked with Google Assistant, which is based on AI and machine learning. This aspect enables Google Allo to suggest possible replies you can use when in chat with different persons. These suggestions get even better and more perfect as you keep using the app. The app also comes with support for stickers and emojis, which adds more zest to the already amazing messaging experience the app promises. Google Assistant offers even more. You can get topical suggestions based on the current topic you are discussing with a friend. For instance, if a place you can have dinner is what you and your friend are talking about, Google Allo, with the help of Assistant, will bring up suggestions of places you can check out. This whole thing can even change into a personal chat with the Assistant, just in case you want more information.

Which is a huge shame, and probably the biggest problem with Android Google has left to fix in the future. Apple Plans a Curved iPhone for 2017 Apple is rumored to be releasing a curved iPhone in 2017, as it prepares three new models designed to give consumers more choice. The iPhone equipped with a curved screen will be sold as a premium model, with the standard model (sans curves) coming in two different sizes. Ads by Google This all comes courtesy of a report by the Nikkei Asian Review, which cites “a source familiar with Apple’s plans”. This source supposedly said, “There will be a 4.7-inch model, another that will be 5.5-inches and a premium handset that will be either 5.5-inches or larger equipped with a screen bent on the two sides.” Apple sees iPhone sales fall again? Well, maybe innovate again and see sales rise. Oh yeah, DON'T REMOVE THE STANDARD HEADPHONE JACK MORONS! — Joe (@bxbrew) July 27, 2016 This description is rather vague, and leaves a lot of wiggle room as to the final design. However, if it’s true in any capacity, it suggests Apple is copying Samsung in its bid to win back customers. In fact, Samsung will be one of Apple’s suppliers, as the Korean company is the only one currently producing flexible OLED screens. This is Apple playing catch-up to a certain extent, as Samsung already offers consumers curved screens on the Galaxy 7 Edge and Note 7. But then Apple needs to do something to compete, as Android now enjoys an 86.2% share of the market Android Is Killing iOS, Uber Launches Self-Driving Cars...

Sony Ups the Price of PlayStation Plus Sony is raising the price of PlayStation Plus 5 Awesome Games That Make PlayStation Plus Worth The Price [MUO Gaming] 5 Awesome Games That Make PlayStation Plus Worth The Price [MUO Gaming] I recently wrote an article about the biggest rip offs in the history of video games. In it, I was quick to point out that Microsoft charges $60 a year for a service that simply... Read More , the subscription service which allows PlayStation owners to play online and earns them free games as a reward. In the United States, annual rates are increasing from $50 to $60, with the 3-month subscriptions rising from $18 to $22. The monthly subscriptions are remaining at $10. The price increases come into effect on September 22nd. PlayStation Plus content manager Greg Lewickyj explained the price changes on the PlayStation Blog, saying: “PlayStation Plus strives to enrich your PlayStation experience through a world-class service built for our fans. This marks the first time that PS Plus membership prices will increase in the U.S. and Canada since the launch of the service in 2010. The new pricing reflects the current market conditions while enabling us to continue providing exceptional value to our members.” Suffice to say this hasn’t gone down well with PlayStation gamers. There have been complaints for months regarding the quality of the free games Sony is giving away, and the increases have been announced in the same month the PS Plus freebies were especially bad.

Under normal circumstances, paper would completely fail to even make a dent in wood. But when it’s attached to a circular saw the motion makes it much stiffer and adds a healthy dose of friction. The result is a sheet of paper capable of slicing through wood. While leaving some rather impressive scorch marks.

Resend activation e-mail Gear & Gadgets / Product News & Reviews Google begins posting Nexus images for the Android 7.0 Nougat update [Updated] Google has started posting images for clean installs and upgrade installs. by Andrew Cunningham - Aug 26, 2016 3:45 am UTC Login to bookmark 62 Enlarge / If you're impatient and your Nexus phone or tablet isn't already downloading Nougat, these files can help you out. Ron Amadeo Google released the final version of Android 7.0 Nougat yesterday after months of public beta testing, and people with supported Nexus phones and tablets should all be able to download it soon. But Google favors a staggered rollout for its updates so it can find and squash early bugs, and it may be several days before your phone or tablet actually offers to download and install the update for you. Impatient early adopters have a couple of options. You can download full system images that require you to wipe your device when you install them or OTA update files that can patch the operating system in place without data loss (the official OTA option is relatively new, and this is the first time Google has offered these downloads for a major update directly). Both methods require the use of the command line adb and fastboot tools and a little bit of knowhow, and you can follow the directions on those pages if you would like to give it a try. As of this writing, only the Pixel C, Wi-Fi Nexus 9, and Nexus Player files have been posted, but we'll link all the images below as they post for your convenience. These are coming directly from Google's servers, the same as they would if you were using the pages above. Update: The Nexus 5X image and OTA are up. Update 2: Two weeks later, the Nexus 6P image is up. Update 3: As of the October security update, all images are finally available. The below links have all been updated to link to the October 2016 images. Nexus 6P (Image/OTA) Nexus 5X (Image/OTA) Nexus 6 (Image/OTA) Nexus 9 Wi-Fi (Image/OTA) Nexus 9 LTE (Image/OTA) Pixel C (Image/OTA) Nexus Player (Image/OTA) The General Mobile 4G, an Android One device that is getting the Nougat update directly from Google but isn't officially part of the Nexus program, is not listed on that download page.

It was less than 5 seconds after I signed up that the update notification to showed up on my phone. https://www.google.com/android/beta 40 posts | registered 6/26/2009 Toleraen Ars Scholae Palatinae jump to post ackmondual wrote: Quote: Impatient early adopters have a couple of options. You can download full system images that require you to wipe your device when you install them I was wondering what a "clean install" was, as previously, that was something I associated with laptop and desktop PCs where if you build your own computer (or perhaps some vendors still do this), the hardrive comes with no OS on it. Well, on any other PC, you can also completely overwrite the OS with a new install (which of course deletes everything you had on the OS partition from before). If you use the full image (not the OTA file) without modifying them, it flashes images to all the partitions on your device, including userdata, so it is effectively a clean install. There are ways to extract the full image and not wipe your personal data, but you may as well use the OTA files for that. 761 posts | registered 5/9/2007 Reader comments 62 You must login or create an account to comment.

Conventional ISPs have some skin in the game as well. They appear to be matching Google Fiber in the cities where it’s available, but a new report shows that Comcast’s gigabit internet service is almost twice as expensive in cities where Google Fiber isn’t available. Google Fiber is already live in Atlanta and will soon go live in Nashville. Comcast offers a $70 per month package in both of these markets to those who sign a three-year contract, the price is double for those who don’t sign a long-term contract. For this price, customers get 1Gbps download and 32Mbps upload speeds without any limits, this is similar to what Google offers. However, in cities where Google Fiber doesn’t exist, Comcast is charging twice as much. Take Chicago for example, Google Fiber isn’t there yet, and Comcast doesn’t offer the $70 per month option there. The cheapest option there costs $140 regardless of whether a long-term contract is signed or not. Comcast did say to Ars Technica that it does offer the $70 plan to residents of Chicago but it’s just not being actively promoted. Reports suggest that it’s actively being hidden from customers and that it’s a chore to try and find the $70 gigabit option. This option was even missing from the press release Comcast sent out announcing the launch of its gigabit service in Chicago. You might not feel that confident in Comcast now if you live in Chicago and opted for the $140 per month option simply because you didn’t know you could get the $70 option as well. Filed in General.

Looking at how it got here and what is inside the new OS reveals much about how different tech works now, when compared with just a few years ago. Google first talked about the new OS, called Nougat, last March, and gave people the opportunity to download an early version of the software. Google appears to have used that feedback heavily in the final version. Interactive Feature Send Us Your Favorite Money Question What’s the single best question about money that anyone has ever asked you — or that you’ve asked of a spouse, family member or loved one? And what was the conversation that ensued? OPEN Interactive Feature Not so long ago, a new computer OS was a huge deal, developed in secret and released with a marketing thunderclap. That was when personal computers were the rule, or PC-type thinking dominated phone marketing. Now speed, feedback and continuous upgrades are the rule. Nougat will appear as an update on a handful of Nexus phones over the next few weeks, and later on a new phone. It is said to have 250 new features, but is unlikely to require a lot of new learning, unlike new versions of Windows on a PC. People don’t have time for that now; if things aren’t more intuitive, they are discarded. Personalization is also a big feature of these mass-market devices, so the phone can do things like provide polyglots with search results in multiple languages, ways to reconfigure Quick Settings controls or 1,500 different emoji for nonverbal communication. Photo Besides feedback and customization, speed is another design principle that has become paramount. Apps can run side by side, notifications can open apps directly and previously used apps can be easily reopened. Advertisement Continue reading the main story If saving seconds sounds like a big deal, it is: Google long ago discovered that even a 200-millisecond delay can make a search seem too slow. That impatience is now a consumer norm. So much for the present state of tech design. Nougat also has a couple of indications about what’s next, in the form of augmented reality and virtual reality functions. A lot of that will be dormant for now, until new games, and hardware like headphones and game controllers, become available. It’s O.K. if you start getting impatient for that stuff. After all, by the time you read this, Nougat will have been out for an entire day or more. Continue reading the main story We’re interested in your feedback on this page. Tell us what you think.

RSS ALL ARTICLES FEATURES ONLY   TRIVIA Search How-To Geek Four Excellent Android Nougat Improvements You May Not Know About Android 7.0 Nougat is another feature-refining build for the OS, with lots of little tweaks and optimizations throughout.  Google covered a lot of the big features when it announced Nougat (then called “Android N”), but today we’re going to highlight a handful of features that you may not have already heard about. RELATED ARTICLES The Best New Features in Android 7.0 “Nougat” How to Get Android Nougat Features on Your Older Phone with N-Ify The Settings Menu Is Now More Efficient The Settings menu in Android has always been a relatively simple place, with everything broken down into an easy-to-use list. One of the more subtle additions here is a new “suggestions” option at the top of the menu—things you may not have yet set up that Google thinks you may want to. I like it.   With Nougat, Google also delivered a feature we didn’t even know we needed in the Settings menu: relevant info under each option. For example, the Wi-Fi menu entry now shows the network name below it, as does Bluetooth. Data Usage now offers a quick look at how much you’ve used, without ever having to enter the menu. Sound shows the current ringer volume, Storage shows how much is used. Really, there’s a lot going on here, and it’s great. Again, this is all about efficiency.   Not only that, but the top-left Hamburger Menu is also present on the Settings page now. That means if you need to jump between menus—let’s say from Wi-Fi to Sound, for example—you no longer have to go back to the main Settings menu to do so: just tap the menu in the upper left, and tap where you want to go. Fassssst. I love it. Nougat Tells You Where Your Apps Came From “Sideloading”—or installing apps from a place other than the Google Play Store—has long been a staple feature for Android power users, but sometimes it’s hard to remember exactly where an app came from. With Nougat, the App Info screen for every installed application will show where it came from: either “App installed from the Google Play Store” or “App installed from Package Manger,” with the latter indicating that it’s a sideloaded app. It’s the little things, you know? Double Tap the Recents Button to Go to Your Previous App If you guys had any idea how often I go back and forth between two apps, you would know how insanely excited I am for this feature. Basically, when you tap the Recent Apps button once, you get the recent apps menu (obviously), which allows you to switch back to another app. But with this new feature, you can simply double-tap it to instantly load the previous application—no menu needed. Switching between a text message and browser just got insanely simple. Apps and Upgrades Install Much Faster If you’ve ever updated your phone (and I’m sure you have), you’ve had to deal with several minutes of “Android is upgrading…” afterwards while Android got apps ready for the new system. This was in large part due to the move from the Dalvik Runtime to the then-new Android Runtime in Lollipop. Now, with Android Nougat, the Android Runtime (Generally referred to as ART), has been updated to allow for much faster installs. That means not only do apps install much quicker, but the “Android is upgrading…” dialog is essentially no longer necessary, as this process has been streamlined to be much, much faster. Thanks Google. This is by no means a definitive list of all the cool stuff that Google included in Android Nougat, but rather some of the lesser-known stuff that many users may not have seen, as well as some of my favorite features of this build. There’s still lots to explore, especially now that Nougat has reached its final implementation and public release. JOIN THE DISCUSSION (6 REPLIES) August 23, 2016 Jason Dagless Wil be great for the 1% that get it in the next few months and the other 40% that might get it in the next 12. As for the other 59%...no chance. Android is a total joke in this area. I bet Google wish they had a time machine for that screw up. I've given up caring as each revision seems to work just the same as the last. August 23, 2016 JoanM I have a Samsung Galaxy S4 with Lollipop (the most recent Android OS available so far as I know.) I don't care about the new features on Marshmallow & Nougat, but am worried about whether I'm getting security patches. Am I? Would love you to comment. August 24, 2016 Faisal Reza I'm not sure samsung will release update or security patches for S4, as it is pretty old smartphone, but if you insist, you can install custom rom such as CyanogenMod. August 24, 2016 Cameron Summerson You've probably gotten a few, but it's unlikely that it's up-to-date with security patches. As much as Google tries to push this, there are so many other variables at play (manufacturer, carrier, etc.) that makes it nearly impossible for all phones to stay up-to-date. Nexus is really a great way to go because of this. August 29, 2016 speederaser Hopefully more people adopt the Nexus platform on Google Fi and drop those bulky/expensive/slow/unsecure other carriers. That or somehow Google starts updating directly and bypasses the carriers. I can't imagine they are really making enough money off those bloatware apps to justify the time spent on making them and frustration they cause users. The carriers probably have Google by the balls in this respect unfortunately. Got Feedback?

SUBSCRIBE Google shares tips on using AMP for e-commerce Google documents how to make your e-commerce site AMP-ready. Barry Schwartz on August 23, 2016 at 8:52 am More Google posted a “journey” of how a developer can use AMP (accelerated mobile pages) to build out their e-commerce webpages. Google said, “AMP is a natural fit for e-commerce because AMP makes webpages fast, and fast pages help with purchase conversions.” Google provided examples of how to build out your e-commerce site using AMP. That means from the home page all the way down to the purchase phase, which technically will take the user off AMP and onto HTML or Progressive Web App (PWA), which would offer a better user experience for the user. The AMP blog documented designing your home page, browse pages, landing pages, related product widgets and product pages with AMP. It also explained how you can use amp-access to personalize and customize the content to the user who is on your site. Then, if you are using PWA for your site, you can use the amp-install-serviceworker to “install a service worker for your domain regardless of where the user is viewing the AMP page. You can then preemptively begin caching content from your PWA so that when the transition out happens, all of the needed content is cached, keeping the experience fast and the customer engaged,” Google said. Of course, SEOs are thinking, should we take our e-commerce sites AMP? Of course, eBay is testing AMP. For more technical details on going retail with AMP, see this blog post.

Google is currently rolling out Nougat to Nexus devices, including the Nexus 6, Nexus 5X, Nexus 6P, Nexus 9, Nexus Player General Mobile 4G (Android One) and Pixel C devices. Even if you have one of these phones, you probably won't get Nougat immediately, as Google is rolling out the update in stages. Expect an over the air update—you should get a notification on your device when it's available—in the coming weeks. If you're running another Android device, getting Android 7.0 isn't a sure thing. While smartphone manufacturers are working on getting Nougat on their devices, you're unlikely to see older model smartphones updated. Some phones have already been confirmed as getting Nougat, though don't expect to see it launch immediately—it will be months before some phones get Nougat. Here are the phones we know will be getting Nougat, though there are no specific dates on when: HTC's HTC 10, HTC One A9 and HTC One M9 Motorola's Moto G4 Plus Samsung's Galaxy Note7 If your smartphone isn't on this list, that doesn't mean it won't be getting an update—simply that the manufacturer hasn't yet confirmed it. If you have a fairly recently released smartphone, it's likely to be updated to Nougat. LG's V20 will be the first smartphone to ship with Nougat pre-installed and we expect Nexus devices will ship with Nougat pre-installed soon. There are good reasons to look forward to the latest version of Android, which has features for fun, productivity and—most importantly—improved battery life. That means something for every Android user, no matter what you use your phone for. If you're focused on entertainment, Nougat offers: Updated emoji, including 72 all new emoji. Better looking games with the new Vulkan graphics API. A new Virtual Reality mode that lets you use some apps in a VR environment via Daydream. Though the phones, headsets and controllers that support it won't be available until later this year, the software is rolling out now. For productivity, Nougat supports: A new multitasking mode that lets you run multiple apps side by side. It's a great addition for tablets, but you can use it on phones, too, sizing the app windows until each is just right. Direct Reply, which lets you easily respond to notifications without leaving the app you're in. Quick Switch, which lets you jump between your recently used apps by tapping the Overview button twice. A Quick Settings menu to easily access Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and other key features—like the flashlight. And, of course, the battery. While an Android update can't make your smartphone's battery bigger, it can improve how your phone uses that battery. Nougat features an updated Doze mode. Originally added to Android in Marshmallow, Doze puts your phone into an energy saving mode when it's not being used—which meant sitting still with the screen off. Nougat improves this by letting your phone Doze even if it's being jostled around in your pocket or purse, which should make the battery savings more significant. You'll still get high priority updates, but for the most part your phone, as the name implies, is taking a nap. Nexus owners can look forward to getting the Nougat update soon while other Android owners, depending on their phone's manufacturer, can expect it in the coming months.

Yet when internet users begin to enter the phrase on the likes of Bing or Yahoo search engines, the phrase auto-completes as the top result. On Google, stories about the Clinton body count are buried under the top results about car repair shops in Clinton. Scroll down fro video  Google has been accused of burying internet searches about an infamous list of mysterious deaths and murders of people allegedly connected to the Clintons The search engine altered an algorithm to prevent searches for 'Clinton body count' from auto-completing, a report claims (pictured is Hillary Clinton in Scranton last week)  The 'Clinton body count' is a long list of people tied to the Clintons who have died in suspicious circumstances since the early 1990s. The alleged death toll is in dispute but some claim more than 50 people, connected with the former president and First Lady have died in mysterious circumstances. RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Hillary Clinton is still EIGHT points ahead of Donald Trump... Trump cancels campaign events without explanation Share this article Share Most recently, DNC staffer Seth Conrad Rich, who was the operations director for voter expansion, was found murdered on July 10. His death initially appeared like a robbery gone wrong but his mother Mary Rich claims that nothing was taken from her son, who was found with two shots in his back. When internet users begin enter the phrase on the likes of Bing or Yahoo search engines, the phrase auto-completes as the top result The mystery surrounding his death has sparked a flurry of theories posted online, including claims that he was on his way to speak to the FBI when he was shot.  There have also been suggestions he fed Wikileaks the 3,000 DNC emails, which hinted that the DNC had favored Clinton over rival Bernie Sanders, that were released at the start of the party's convention last week. Wikileaks' Julian Assange has also hinted that Rich was a source. Rich's death - along with four other deaths in recent weeks - reignited the old rumors that Hillary Clinton and her husband will stop at nothing when they want to silence someone who could stand in the way of their political ambition.  On the face of it, such speculation seems ludicrous, but that doesn't stop the talk. And after decades in the national spotlight Bill and Hillary have amassed enough enemies who are more than happy to point to the number of Clinton associates who have died before their time. Bing's top auto-complete result for 'Clinton body' is 'Clinton body count' 'I'm not saying the Clintons kill people. I'm saying a lot of people around the Clintons turn up dead,' Larry Nichols, who worked with the former First Family before turning against them told Daily Mail Online. After Fox News' Greta Van Susteren tweeted about the death on July 26 of Mark Weiner,  a Clinton confidante preparing to go see his old friend Bill speak at the DNC, her Twitter feed was filled with comments suggesting one or both of the Clintons were somehow responsible. Weiner, who had long suffered from leukemia, suddenly felt ill and put himself to bed. Within hours he was dead. 'ANOTHER Clinton 'friend' dies at a young age! Glad they aren't my friends!' tweeted Kathy East.  'Did they find a note, or are they still writing it?' queried Irina Florescu.  'Who doesn't the Clintons bump off? Pure evil,' commented Robin Kay Anderson. 'Did he know too much?' asked Ben Nicola Sr. Most recently, DNC staffer Seth Conrad Rich, who was the Operations Director for Voter Expansion, was found murdered on July 10 Websites with names such as Whatreallyhappened.com, Clintonmemoriallibrary.com and Govtslaves.info obsessively list the deaths going back decades, desperately trying to pin them on Bill or Hillary. Most put the total at around 50. Others list nearly 80. Some go even higher. They document people who have supposedly killed themselves or been murdered. Many have died in plane crashes. Other deaths have been put down to natural causes. The lists have circulated on the internet for years. Now the death Rich, among others, have set the rumors afire again. 'I can't give a guarantee that everyone on my list was killed deliberately but they all have the potential,' Michael Rivero, the webmaster of Whatreallyhappened told Daily Mail Online in an exclusive interview. 'But by the general law of statistics there are just way too many of them.'  'Just the sheer number raises questions,' he said. The political establishment dismisses such talk as conspiracy theory gone wild. And indeed many of the lists that circulate on the web are poorly sourced and run by people who see evil in anything the Clintons do Snopes.com, a website that covers urban rumors has attempted to debunk the rumors. It points out that the Clintons' years in power have led them to have thousands of people who can claim they know them and the number of their deaths is not out of the ordinary. Snopes founder David Mikkelson says talk about the Clintons being involved is 'claptrap.'  'In a frenzied media climate where the Chief Executive couldn't boff a White House intern without the whole world finding out every niggling detail of each encounter and demanding his removal from office, are we seriously to believe the same man had been having double handfuls of detractors and former friends murdered with impunity?' he wrote.   Internet users are still able to search for 'Clinton body count' on Google, but the search does not auto-complete. Most dismiss the Clinton body count as the work of conspiracy theorists, saying that after decades in the national spotlight Bill and Hillary have amassed enough enemies who are more than happy to point to the number of Clinton associates who have died before their time In June, another report by SourceFed, accused Google of attempting to boost secretly Clinton's presidential candidacy by burying negative press. In another example, they found that typing 'Hillary Clinton cri,' into Google auto-completes with a top result of 'Hillary Clinton crime reform.' But once again, other search engines returned top results of 'Hillary Clinton criminal charges' and 'Hillary Clinton crime.' Sourcefed claims the results are evidence that Google is trying to hide the conspiracy theories surrounding Hillary. 'While that could reflect legitimate differences in the engines' algorithms, Mr. Lieberman said that a search of 'Hillary Clinton crime reform' on Google trends showed that 'there weren't even enough searches of term to build a graph on the site,' the site said. Interestingly, negative stories about Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump and former Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders, still auto-complete on Google raising further questions of bias. Last year, Robert Epstein warned that 'Google could rig the 2016 election' - shifting voting preferences by up to 80 per cent in some areas - by altering its search algorithms.  Google adjusts its search engine algorithm 600 times a year, but the process is a closely guarded secret.    The search engine has not responded to requests for comment from DailyMail.com.  THE NOTORIOUS 'CLINTON BODY COUNT' LIST The names on the various Internet lists varies from one website to another, but these are among those most frequently cited as possible victims of a vast Clinton conspiracy.  Kevin Ives, 17 and 16-year-old Don Henry, were murdered in a rural community just south of Little Rock Kevin Ives and Don Henry, both 17, crushed by a train, August 23, 1987. Their deaths were ruled accidental, with the medical examiner saying they had fallen asleep on a railroad line after smoking marijuana, but a grand jury found they had been murdered before being placed on the tracks. They had allegedly stumbled on a plot to smuggle drugs and guns from an airport in Mena, Arkansas that Bill Clinton was said to be involved in as state governor. Victor Raiser, 53, small plane crash, July 30, 1992. The second finance co-chair of Bill Clinton's presidential campaign was killed along with his son during a fishing vacation in Alaska. Campaign press secretary Dee Dee Myers called Raiser a major player in the organization. Paul Tully, 48, apparent heart attack, September 25, 1992. A chain-smoking, heavy drinking political consultant who weighed in at more than 320 lb. Tully died seven weeks before Clinton's first presidential election win. He had been political director of the DNC during Clinton's rise. Tully was on the left of the Democratic Party and usually worked for those who shared his views, however he agreed to work for Clinton because he was impressed with his oratory and thought he was the only Democrat who could beat President George Bush. Paula Gober, 36, single car accident, December 7, 1992. She was Clinton's interpreter for the deaf for several years and traveled with him while he was governor of Arkansas. Her vehicle overturned on a bend, throwing her 30 feet. There were no witnesses. Vince Foster, 48, committed suicide on July 20, 1993. He was an Arkansas lawyer who Bill appointed as deputy White House counsel when he became president in 1993. It didn't take long for Foster, 48, to realize he had made a terrible mistake by accepting the post. He hated the work and fell into a deep depression. Just six months into the job, his body was found in his car in Fort Marcy Park, Virginia, a gun in his hand and a suicide note torn into 27 pieces in the trunk. Stanley Heard, 47, small plane crash, September 10, 1993. An Arkansas chiropractor who, according to the book, A Profession of One's Own, treated the Clinton family, Heard was asked by Bill Clinton to represent the practice as plans for 'Hillarycare' were being finalized. His attorney Steve Dickson, was flying him home from a healthcare meeting in Washington DC just eight months into the Clinton presidency. On the way to the capital from his home in Kansas, Dickson's small plane developed problems so he landed in St. Louis and rented another plane. That rented plane was the one that crashed in rural Virginia, killing both men. Jerry Parks was head of campaign security Jerry Parks, 47, shot to death, September 23, 1993. Parks was head of security for Bill Clinton's headquarters in Arkansas. As he drove home in West Little Rock, two men in a white Chevrolet pulled alongside his car and sprayed it with semi-automatic gunfire. As Parks's car stopped a man stepped out of the Chevy and shot him twice with a 9mm pistol and sped off. Despite there being several witnesses, no-one was ever arrested. The killing came two months after Parks had watched news of Vince Foster's death and allegedly told his son Gary 'I'm a dead man.' His wife Lois remarried and her second husband, Dr. David Millstein was stabbed to death in 2006. Edward Willey Jr, 60,  Willey, 60, was having serious money problems and his wife, a volunteer aide in the White House, agreed to ask Bill Clinton for a paid job. Their meeting ended when Clinton allegedly forced himself on her in the Oval Office, kissing her, fondling her breast and pushing her hand on to his genitals. Four years later Kathleen Willey wrote a book in which she put forward a theory that the Clintons may have had her husband murdered. She said after his death, a friend had told her that Ed had confided that he took briefcases full of cash to the Clintons' base in Little Rock, Arkansas during Bill's first presidential campaign. Herschel Friday, 70, small plane crash, March 1, 1994. Friday was an Arkansas lawyer who Richard Nixon had once considered for the Supreme Court. Friday was known as a benefactor of Bill Clinton, serving on his campaign finance committee. Kathy Ferguson, 37, gun suicide, May 11, 1994. She was the ex-wife of Arkansas State Trooper Danny Ferguson, who was named in a sexual harassment suit brought by Paula Jones against Bill Clinton. Ferguson left a note blaming problems with her fiancé, Bill Shelton. A month later Shelton, upset about the suicide verdict, killed himself. Then-President-elect Bill Clinton, right, puts his arm around the shoulders of Ron Brown Ron Brown,  54, plane crash, April 3, 1996. Brown was chair of the Democratic National Committee during Bill Clinton's rise to the presidential nomination and was rewarded with the cabinet position. He was under a corruption investigation when his plane slammed into a mountainside in Croatia. Doctors who examined his body found a circular wound on the top of his head which led to suspicions that he had died before the plane crashed, but that theory was later discounted. The crash was attributed to pilot error. Charles Meissner, 56, same plane crash as Brown. Meissner was assistant secretary for international trade and had been criticized for allegedly giving special security clearance to John Huang, who later pleaded guilty to federal conspiracy charges for violating campaign finance laws, in a case that enmeshed the Clinton administration. Barbara Wise, 48, natural causes, November 29, 1996. Wise, who worked alongside Brown, Meissner and Huang in the Commerce Department was found dead at her desk on the day after Thanksgiving 1996. Her death was originally classified as a homicide but police later said Wise, 48, who had a history of severe ill health, had died from natural causes. A local TV station initially quoted an unidentified police source as saying her body was partially nude and her office was locked, but those reports were also later denied. Mary Mahoney was a White House intern Mary Mahoney was just 25 when she was gunned down along with two assistants at the Washington D.C. Starbucks in 1997 where she was night manager. Mahoney, a lesbian, was also a White House intern and gay rights activist who reportedly acted as a 'mother-figure' to various women who had allegedly been sexually harassed by Bill Clinton. John Ashe, former United Nations General Assembly president and U.N. ambassador from Antigua and Barbuda John Ashe, 61, a politician and former president of the United Nations General Assembly, was pumping iron at his home in Dobbs Ferry, New York on June 22 when he dropped the weight. He died from 'traumatic asphyxiation.  Ashe was about to stand trial in a corruption case for allegedly receiving $500,000 from billionaire real estate developer Ng Lap Seng. Ng was involved in a fundraising scandal and named in a 1998 Senate report for illegally funneling hundreds of thousands of dollars to the DNC during Bill Clinton's presidency. 'During the trial, the prosecutors would have linked Ashe to the Clinton bagman Ng. It would have been very embarrassing. His death was conveniently timed,' The New York Post reported. Mark Weiner, 62, died on July 26. He had been due to be part of the Rhode Island delegation to the convention but pulled out due to ill health. However, Weiner, who was suffering from leukemia, still planned to travel to Philadelphia to see Bill Clinton speak and was dressing for the trip when he suddenly said he felt ill. Weiner, who raised prodigious amounts of money for both Clintons, never woke up. Both Bill and Hillary attended his funeral in Providence last week, with the former president giving the eulogy, remembering his old pal as 'forever young, forever exuberant … always just a little too much.' Victor Thorn, 54, a journalist and strong critic of the couple climbed a mountain near his State College, Pennsylvania home on his August 1  birthday and shot himself to death. He wrote a trilogy of books on the Clintons, devoting one of the books to the number of their contacts who had mysteriously died Lawyer Shawn Lucas died on August 2  Shawn Lucas, 38,  a lawyer who supported Bernie Sanders, was found dead on August 2 on the bathroom floor of his Washington DC apartment. Just a month earlier he had attempted to serve papers on Wasserman-Schultz in a fraud case that alleges the party had unfairly favored Hillary Clinton in the primaries over Sanders. A video of Lucas taking the papers to the DNC's Washington headquarters has been viewed almost 400,000 times as of Wednesday morning on YouTube. In it, Lucas, who was said to have been a Sanders supporter and worked for a company called One Source Process, calls serving the papers 'the most gratifying thing I have ever done.' Lucas's mother Susan told Daily Mail Online the family is currently awaiting results of an autopsy and she does not know why her son died. 'He was a young man — 38. He was in good health,' she said. 'But these things happen when people in seemingly good health suddenly die. The list of deaths associated with people who had worked with Clinton was originally drawn up by right-wing radio personality Linda Thompson. She too died early in May 2009. She was 56 when she took an overdose of medication prescribed for a gastric bypass surgery she had had more than a decade earlier. Joe Montano, a former DNC Chairman with in-depth knowledge of Hillary Clinton's campaign, has also been named as on the unofficial list after he died from what authorities say was a heart attack on July 25 - the day the DNC started. Seth Conrad Rich, who was the Operations Director for Voter Expansion for the DNC, was found murdered on July 10. His death initially appeared like a robbery gone wrong but his mother Mary Rich claims that nothing was taken from her son, who was found with two shots in his back. The mystery surrounding his death has sparked a flurry of theories posted online, including claims that he was on his way to speak to the FBI when he was shot.  Seth Conrad Rich , who was the Operations Director for Voter Expansion for the DNC, was found murdered on July 10  Read more: Google Hides "Clinton Body Count" Search Suggestions » Alex Jones' Infowars: There's a war on for your mind!

Social site Orkut had a sizable presence in those two countries but not elsewhere, leading Google to shut its doors in 2014. The founder, Orkut Büyükkökten, is trying again with Hello Network, a new network based on interests. Hello is not part of Google — but it’s got some Google cash. According to multiple sources, Google has recently backed several early startups from former employees, including Hello, adding to Google’s already complex weave of corporate financing. It’s unlikely Google is deploying these funds to dig back into social media or generate massive returns. Instead, these deals seem mostly about Google’s ongoing attempt to keep familiar engineers close to the company fold. A rep for Google declined to comment. Büyükkökten and two other founders backed this way — Keith Coleman and Noam Lovinsky, former Google product managers — did not return requests for comment. Google is funding the companies using convertible notes, according to a source familiar with the deals. While Google’s staff is acting as an adviser, the search giant does not have special rights in the terms, like first dibs on an acquisition, according to the source. These funds are coming directly from Google, the internet company, generated by M&A boss Don Harrison and his team. They’re not from Google Capital or GV, the investment arms of Google parent Alphabet, which back bigger startups. I don’t know how large these investments are, but sources indicate that they’re less than $10 million. And Google has quietly been making these sorts of investments over the past couple years. This arrangement is different from bigger strategic investments Harrison et al. have made off Google’s balance sheet — like those in Elon Musk’s SpaceX and augmented reality whatsit Magic Leap. It’s also different from Area 120, the startup incubator that Harrison is helping to oversee, which hopes to keep Googlers with an entrepreneurial itch inside the company. In essence, Google has long fixated on keeping its fingers in every cranny of Silicon Valley.

lifehacker Deadspin Gizmodo Jalopnik Jezebel Kotaku Lifehacker index Skillet Two Cents Vitals App directory Gear The Coolest Features of Android Nougat You Might Have Missed Eric Ravenscraft8/23/16 4:00am Filed to: android android n google news features developer preview feature editors picks 77 14 Edit Promote Dismiss Undismiss Share to Kinja Toggle Conversation tools Go to permalink Yesterday, Google released Android Nougat for Nexus owners. It comes with some sweet new headlining features like multi-window support and bundled notifications. After digging into the developer preview we found even more treats that you might’ve missed. All the New Features Coming in Android Nougat All the New Features Coming in Android Nougat All the New Features Coming in Android Nougat Google just took the wraps off of the developer preview for “Android N,” the next version of… Read more Read more Doze Now Works Even When You’re Moving Android Marshmallow introduced a powerful battery saving feature that disabled most of the things that drain your battery when you left your phone sitting on a table. Now, you can get that same power when you don’t use your phone when it’s moving. Doze will activate if you don’t touch your phone for a while even if it’s in your purse, sitting in your car, or jostling in your pocket. Data Saver Mode Keeps You From Blowing Through Your Data Cap Data caps suck, but most carriers have some form of metered data. Unless you want to pay more, you need to keep wily apps from blowing through your stash. Data Saver mode can help with that. When you enable Data Saver mode, any app that’s running in the background won’t be able to access cellular data (unless you add them to a white list). If you start to get close to your data cap—which you can edit in Settings > Data usage—Android will prompt you to enable data saver mode. Double-Tapping the Recents Button Swaps Between Your Last Used Apps The Recents button already makes it easy to scroll through your list of open apps and Chrome tabs. In Android Nougat, you can double-tap the Recents button to switch right back to the last app you had open. Advertisement If you need to quickly jump to an app other than the last one you had open, you can also repeatedly tap the Recents button to cycle through all the apps you have open. It’s like a rough equivalent of Alt-Tab, but on your phone. It’s not quite as natural as the double-tap gesture, but it can be easier than manually scrolling through a rolodex of apps once you get used to it. Long-Press a Notification to Easily Silence It Android has a ton of options for managing which apps can send you notifications buried deep within it. However, it can be tedious to tweak them. Now, in Android Nougat if you see a notification you don’t like, you can long-press it to see a few options to get rid of it. You can set it to show notifications from that app silently, block all notifications for that app entirely, or jump to the Settings app to tweak them more precisely. Manually Set an App’s Priority In Your Notification Shade With the System UI Tuner This feature is tucked away in Android’s constantly-changing System UI Tuner menu. Internally, Android assigns an invisible priority level to all your notifications from 0 (blocked entirely) to 5 (show at the top of the list and allow full screen interruption). Normally, you shouldn’t ever need or want to tweak this setting, but if you have some very specific needs for your notifications, you can tweak this setting. The Built-In File Manager Is a Lot More Powerful In Android Marshmallow, Google introduced a basic file manager that allowed you to browse folders, make copies of files, and...that’s about it. Now, the file manager, called Explorer, allows you to move files, rename files and folders, and create new folders—in short, do everything a decently powerful file manager should let you do. You can also open multiple instances of Explorer so you can jump between separate folders. While apps like Solid Explorer, our favorite file manager for Android, are still far more robust, anyone who just needs basic file management will get along with the built-in tools nicely. The Best File Management App for Android The Best File Management App for Android The Best File Management App for Android File managers may be a dime a dozen on Android, but Solid Explorer stands out from the pack. With… Read more Read more You Can Block Phone Numbers At the System Level If you’re tired of telemarketers, robocalls, and spammers, Android Nougat has a system-level call blocking feature that will apply across the entire phone. Once a number is blocked, it can’t text or call your phone. The settings persist across resets, so if you get a new phone or wipe your current one, you’re not starting from scratch (which also means that blocked numbers are stored in your Google account, which is nice!) Also, any app can access the block list, so you don’t block someone from calling you but not from texting you via Hangouts, for example. Up until now, there have been a few options for blocking calls on Android, but most of them are half-measures. Blocking a number in your dialer doesn’t block it in your VoIP app, blocking a text sender doesn’t block phone calls, and blocking any incoming caller only routes their calls to voicemail, where you’ll have to deal with their message later. This new feature even deletes their voicemails. Do Not Disturb Can Be Set to End Automatically When an Alarm Goes Off Android’s Do Not Disturb mode allows you to set quiet hours that block most or all notifications. In Android Nougat, Do Not Disturb can be set to override your quiet hours settings when your first alarm in the morning goes off. So, for example, if you set Do Not Disturb to end at 7:00 AM every day, but you need to get up at 6:00AM one day, you’ll start getting notifications as soon as that first alarm goes off, without changing your normal rules. A New Tile Editor Lets You Customize Your Quick Settings Tiles The Quick Settings shade in Android is a handy way to enable or disable things like Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, or auto rotation. Now, you can pick and choose which tiles show up in your shade with the new tile editor. Simply pull down the Quick Settings shade and tap the Edit button to remove the ones you don’t need, drag in new ones, or reorganize them how you see fit. Adjust the Size of Your Interface With the New Display Size Slider In previous versions of Android, you could adjust your text size if you wanted to make more use of that freakishly gigantic phone of yours. However, you couldn’t do anything about the comically large icons. Now, you can tweak both with a new slider that can adjust the size of the interface elements on your screen. A Work Mode Toggle Can Disable All Your Work-Related Apps When You Clock Out If your company uses Android For Work to manage your work phone, you just got a new tool to help you detach from the office. A new Work Mode Quick Settings tile will now let you disable all your work apps with one button. Just pull down your shade, tap the toggle, and you’re all clocked out. Enjoy your time off! You Can Add Emergency Contact and Medical Information to Your Home Screen In Android Nougat, you can add custom emergency contact information to your dialer, so anyone can pick up your phone and immediately see who they can contact or read important information about you—in addition to placing an emergency call, like you’ve always been able to do. You can add your full name, address, date of birth, blood type, known allergies, medications, medical conditions, organ donor status, and emergency contacts. We’ve always suggested you do this, but now it’s baked in to Android. Head to Settings > Users > Emergency Info to add your info. Keep in mind, this information can be accessed by anyone with your phone. It’s not displayed on the lock screen directly—you have to dig into the emergency dialer to find it—but it’s still available without unlocking first. Add Emergency Contact Information to Your Phone's Lock Screen Add Emergency Contact Information to Your Phone's Lock Screen Add Emergency Contact Information to Your Phone's… Turn your phone's lock screen into a potentially life-saving tool by adding important In Case… Read more Read more No More Waiting to “Optimize Apps” Every Time You Update After Android switched to the ART runtime in Android 4.4 Kit Kat, every time an Android phone got a major update, it had to go through an “Optimizing apps” phase the first time it restarts, which takes forever. Now, Google’s made a change to the runtime that skips the optimization step entirely, and makes the process much faster. Even better, this means that apps will install faster as well. Anecdotally, I found that re-downloading the 100+ apps I have on my Nexus 6P after I wiped and installed Android N took mere minutes, instead of the hour or so it usually takes. Android's ART vs Dalvik: Performance and Battery Life Compared Android's ART vs Dalvik: Performance and Battery Life Compared Android's ART vs Dalvik: Performance and Battery… One of the lesser known features of Android 4.4 was a new runtime called ART which should… Read more Read more The Features In the Beta That Were Removed We’ve been using the developer preview since it first dropped. As we expected, there were a few features present in the beta that weren’t meant for the release. For posterity (or so you can ask Google to bring them back for good next year), here are the casualties we found in the final release: Advertisement Advertisement Night Mode: For the second year in a row, Google teased preview users with a night mode only to snatch it away in the final version. However, there’s a silver lining. If you updated from the existing beta without wiping your phone, there’s a chance you can still access Night Mode from the Quick Settings shade. Otherwise, we’ll all have to wait and hope Google makes this official next year. Manual Display Calibration: A setting buried in the System UI tuner allowed users to calibrate the RGB levels of their display manually. Understandably, Google decided not to give regular users the ability to accidentally screw up their displays with this. On the surface, there are only a couple of big headlining features in Android Nougat like split-screen apps or an upcoming VR mode. Under the hood, though, there are a ton of nice little tweaks that make your phone a little bit easier to use day-to-day.

Google Assistant Answers Voice Messages in Allo The feature could be available in Allo messaging app Aug 23, 2016 13:23 GMT  ·  By Alexandra Vaidos  ·  Share:  Google started rolling out Duo video calling app last week and its highly anticipated Allo messaging app has yet to be released. Some features have been revealed thanks to the beta testing program and one of them is the option to get answers to questions in voice messages. Android Police found that Google Assistant will come with the option to answer questions in voice messages in Allo application. Assistant is based on Google Now / OK Google commands and the feature will be able to interpret voice messages in Allo. However, Google's Assistant won't be able to answer questions inside Incognito mode for privacy reasons and because such conversations are encrypted. Users will be able to type a question or record a voice message inside Allo and get an answer from Google's Assistant. The service will first transcribe the message and then provide the answer. The question can be sent even when users are offline and the answer will be received once they connect to the Internet again. However, it's worth noting that the feature seemed to appear during a few tests in the preview version and results could be different in the final version of Allo and Assistant. Allo is also expected to come with expiring messages, a feature that's found inside Snapchat. Users will be able to send messages linked to a certain period of time and they will be automatically deleted from the chat, once that time period expires.   CHECK OUT THE GALLERY  (3 Images) #Google#Google Assistant#Allo#Duo#Snapchat reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Assistant will answer voice messages in Allo (3 Images) 01 02 03 Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Google’s Allo Lets Users Delete Messages from Chat History Google Duo Becomes the Most Popular Free App in the Play Store Google to Add Audio Calls Support in Duo Hangouts On Air Moving from Google+ to YouTube Live on September 12 iPhone 8 to Feature Traditional Wireless Charging like the Samsung Galaxy S7 Lenovo Builds a New Microsoft Surface Clone and It Looks Fabulous Anonymous Hackers Want McAfee to Be Trump’s Security Adviser, Call for March Hackers Could Infect Headphones to Spy on You The LG V20 Has Been Successfully Rooted Galaxy S6 and S7 Owners Complain About Samsung’s Stock Email App Facebook Is Testing a New Snapchat-like Camera Feature Google Adds Stranger Things Stickers to Allo, New Themes to Arrive Soon 3 photos    Voice messages in Allo New Android APKs VivaVideo APK: Updated November 23rd, 14:19 GMT PowerDirector APK: Updated November 23rd, 14:08 GMT WeVideo APK: Updated November 23rd, 14:04 GMT Amazon Rapids APK: Updated November 23rd, 14:02 GMT ActionDirector APK: Updated November 23rd, 13:58 GMT DataEye APK: Updated November 23rd, 13:46 GMT JOOX APK: Updated November 23rd, 13:46 GMT Reader comments Honor 8 Hands-On Impressions: Some High-End Specs Mixed with Premium Design more on: Honor 8 i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2016 Softpedia.

Wccftech News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile  ⋮  Software Android Nougat Starts Rolling Out to Nexus Devices By Rafia Shaikh Posted Aug 22, 2016 29Shares Share Tweet Submit Google typically releases new Android versions with the launch of new Nexus smartphones. However, this year the search engine giant is breaking all the traditions. Android Nougat 7.0 has started rolling out today as an over the air update to Nexus devices. Android Nougat arrives today Google surprised everyone with an early launch of the Android N public beta back in March. Not only did Google make this launch early, it also introduced a Beta Program offering an easy over the air update process. Expected to be released to the public with new Nexus hardware, Google has broken another tradition this year. Nougat is out of beta as Google’s latest mobile operating system is rolling out as an over the air update to all the supported Nexus devices. These include: Nexus 6P Nexus 5X Nexus 6 Nexus 9 Pixel C tablet Nexus Player General Mobile 4G (Android One) Devices that are enrolled in the Android Beta Program will also receive today’s update. With today’s launch, it has become official that Nexus 5 and Nexus 7 2013 won’t receive the Android Nougat update from Google. But for others, it’s time to start the “refresh game,” as we know you can’t wait to try all the new features that Android Nougat has promised. It will take your device some time before the update arrives, as the rollout usually takes an entire day to reach out to all the different devices in different regions. We will be posting a detailed review of Android 7.0 Nougat later today, including its 72 new emojis, split-screen multitasking, support for Vulkan API, Daydream, and improved notifications. If you are enrolled in the Beta Program, you won’t experience any major differences in today’s release. Google has been sharing and releasing all the major features over the past few months. Last release also brought stability and performance improvements, pointing to an imminent final release.

File picture: Marcio Jose Sanchez Los Angeles - Google is investing hundreds of thousands of dollars apiece in virtual-reality films and programmes, part of a plan to line up exclusive content for the debut of its new Daydream service in the coming weeks, according to people familiar with the matter. Google will help promote projects from Hulu and fund the production of 360-degree videos with YouTube stars like the Dolan twins and Justine Ezarik, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing private deals. The division of Alphabet Inc. has also partnered with video-game producers and sports leagues to boost its biggest virtual-reality initiative. “It’s apparent they’ve spent a lot of money internally,” said Finn Staber, co-founder of TheWaveVR, a virtual-reality startup developing a music app for Daydream. The company is relying on apps, shorts and games to promote Daydream, a hybrid store and software service that Google hopes will be the dominant way people engage in virtual reality, much like Android is for smartphones. An update to Android software that will support Daydream began rolling out Monday. The idea is to encourage the growth of the technology and ensure Google maintains a central role in helping people find things to watch. Google is entering what has quickly become a crowded marketplace, with products from Facebook, Sony, Samsung Electronics and HTC. Whereas Sony’s Morpheus headset is tethered to its PlayStation video-game console, Google is focused on mobile-based VR, whereby consumers snap their phones into a visor or headset. With the headset on, Daydream presents users with an array of apps, from YouTube to HBO Now. “Google’s Daydream will help advance mobile virtual reality,” said Oren Rosenbaum, a digital media agent at United Talent Agency who spearheads its VR effort. “Mobile virtual reality is what’s going to get the most people to strap things on their head.” While competitors are targeting users willing to spend hundreds of dollars for top-notch VR equipment, mobile will reach mass audiences, Staber said. In June, he watched a live performance at the video-game expo E3 in Los Angeles from the comfort of his Austin home. “It’s revolutionary,” Staber said, adding he and his partners had been collaborating with Google’s VR team over the past few months. Google’s growing investment in virtual reality tantalises filmmakers eager for more resources. While Facebook has spent millions of dollars on individual projects, most large media companies have been circumspect about investing too much money in a new storytelling medium with a small audience. This being Google’s first major virtual-reality content initiative, the company doesn’t want to spend too much just yet and is spreading money around to see what works, the people familiar with the matter said. Google is spending high six figures on video games, and is offering from low five figures to low six figures for projects with filmmakers and online talent, the people said. Filmmakers working with Google must use a 16-camera rig optimised for the company’s Jump software platform for virtual-reality content. GoPro is making one, called Odyssey, priced at $15 000. Though a few elite VR filmmakers have either balked at the budgets or the requirement that they use Google’s camera, dozens of filmmakers have signed up to work with YouTube, the people said. YouTube won’t demand an ownership stake in the projects filmmakers create with its funds, since the Google division is more interested in encouraging creative people to produce content around the debut of Daydream to stoke awareness and excitement. App lineup YouTube will be one of dozens of apps available within Daydream, alongside HBO’s streaming service, Hulu and apps from sports leagues like the NBA and MLB. Google will co-market some of the programming. Though its projects won’t be exclusive to Daydream, Hulu will time the release of several pieces to the debut of Google’s platform. Daydream will be introduced around the same time as the release of new Android phones, VR headsets and controllers. The latest version of Android has VR-enhancing features including faster graphics processing, quicker head tracking and better use of data from multiple sensors. Google had been working on its own headset, but the company has mainly focused on reference designs for headsets, and controllers, for other companies to build their own VR devices. It would rather turn Daydream, known to some as Android VR, into the dominant interface for virtual reality. Google designed a controller to make mobile-based VR more interactive. With a headset on, people can use the remote to navigate and select apps. The company is offering creative and financial support to apps that use its controller, such as Tilt Brush, a painting app it purchased in April 2015, and the Wave, which enables DJs to create and perform music live for people wearing headsets either in the audience or sitting at home. “They want more content in the store to get people talking,” Rosenbaum said. “Google investing in the space continues the momentum and growth we’re all expecting.” BLOOMBERG Like us on Facebook Connect with us on LinkedIn Hungry for more business news?

What can You Learn from Adwords and Analytics? August 23, 2016 by Thomas Coppen Leave a Comment The world of paid search has always been a fast-moving, constantly evolving beast, with Google and Bing continually updating their processes in the eternal quest of delivering optimal user experience. However, in the past couple of months, AdWords has seen more modifications than Larry Page and Sergey Brin (Google founders) could possibly shake a stick at, with Expanded Text Ads dramatically changing the Pay-Per-Click game, side ads disappearing in favour of a ‘mobile-first’ layout, and the word ‘Ad’ even getting a green facelift, ensuring that paid listings blend into organic search results more naturally. Likewise, Google Analytics – the free tool for tracking and reporting website traffic – has undergone recent developments, enhancing various aspects of data capture that have excited PPC managers the world over. Anyone can set up an AdWords account and get a few quick clicks, but specialist Pay-Per-Click marketers know that thorough research and testing is key to generating serious returns, and this is where Analytics plays its part in successful PPC campaign management. Search Console Integration One of the new additions to Analytics is Search Console, the previously standalone tool designed to help website owners manage their appearance in organic search results. It’s long been possible to link the two and view Search Console data within Analytics, but reports were always displayed in isolation rather than next to each other. Now, though, you can view both metrics side-by-side, giving a much fuller picture of how people reach your site from organic searches and what they do once they land on your page. This improved integration allows you to see which landing pages are performing well in organic searches, but aren’t getting enough engagement once people click-through, giving real clarity on what pages need attention to enhance the customer journey. Similarly, at the other end of the scale, you can see which pages have high engagement rates, perhaps as a result of targeted AdWords marketing, but aren’t getting many impressions in organic search listings. As such, you can use this insight to optimise your page titles and snippets and, hopefully, your organic performance should improve. You can also see what keywords or phrases are driving traffic to your site, giving AdWords managers real-time data that can be used to refine PPC campaigns, perhaps in the form of A/B testing, i.e. running different versions of the same ad in parallel to see which one performs better over time. Location, location, location If you have international ambitions, knowing how your website performs in different countries is critical, and the Country report gives you immediate visibility on how your pages are doing around the world. You can then use this information to see what’s working organically and ask yourself why, giving you an idea of where you should focus your attention. You can then create bespoke landing pages targeted at individual nations, which should further improve engagement, and then set up paid search campaigns targeted at the markets you want to corner. Devices Report Mobile marketing has been the talk of the PPC town this year, as Google goes all-in on a mobile-first layout due to consumers accessing the web more frequently from mobiles than their desktops. The new Devices Report in Analytics allows you to segment and review your traffic from phones, tablets and desktops, providing a goldmine of data that can be used to ensure your mobile marketing is up to scratch This added level of detail allows AdWords marketers to investigate which pages are ranking organically on separate devices, and look to replicate the copy on high-performing pages when composing ad text. If something is working well organically, there’s a surefire chance that following the same pattern will work wonders for your AdWords campaigns. AdWords agencies have been gearing up for the recent announcement that bid adjustments can be split between different devices, so learning how and why your visitors behave differently according to how they’re accessing your site is becoming increasingly key to successful AdWords campaign management. Google Analytics has traditionally been regarded as an SEO tool, but it’s a veritable treasure trove of information that should be central to the makeup of any self-respecting AdWords marketer, now more so than ever.

Google announced it has commenced the initial roll out of the latest version of its mobile OS and platform – Android 7.0, also known as Nougat as that’s a sweet beginning with N. As ever the first devices to get it will be the Google-made Nexus ones and then the broader roll out depends on how much effort your smartphone maker is prepared to put in. There are apparently over 250 major features in Android Nougat, but perhaps the most noteworthy is the split-screen view that allows you to have two apps running in the foreground at once – handy for the increasing number of people who find being able to switch between a million apps at the touch of a screen still isn’t distracting enough. You can find some more highlights on the official Nougat page. One company that has done very well out of Android is Samsung, which has been by far the number one global Android smartphone vendor for years. This has never been enough for the Korean tech giant, however, which would like to extend the relationship with its customers beyond the sale of the device and into recurring software and services business. On Android Google pretty much owns that relationship and most Samsung efforts to impose its own fare on the platform have either been met by resistance from Google or been dismissed as bloatware. The only alternative, therefore, is for Samsung to develop its own mobile platform, which it has, called Tizen. Tizen has been around for quite a while and is used by Samsung to run its smart phones, but has now found a home on the first Tizen 4G phone – the Samsung Z2 – which will launch on the Jio network in India and be pre-loaded with bespoke Jio and Samsung goodness. “Samsung Z2 makes 4G accessible and relevant to the unique needs of feature phone users and first time smartphone buyers,” said Manu Sharma, VP of the Samsung India Mobile Business. “It brings consumers a fast and affordable mobile internet experience that will democratize 4G usage in the country.” The Z2 is has been priced at INR 4,590, which is under $70 and thus pretty cheap. The reason no smartphone platforms other than iOS have been able to compete with Android is mainly down to apps, but also the fact that it is licence free. The latter is one of the main reasons Windows Phone failed while the former is pretty much a deal-breaker for most consumers. Only by offering a lot more bang-per-buck can a non-Android smartphone hope to compete and Samsung will be hoping the Z2 is just that, but precedent doesn’t offer much cause for optimism.

Is the Newly Beta-Cleared Android Nougat Worth the Upgrade? Android Nougat is past the beta phase as it comes on select Nexus devices with new features and higher efficiency; however, all its capabilities are yet to be tested By: Staff Writer on Aug 23, 2016 at 8:42 am EST Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Add to Flipboard Magazine. In March, Google shocked everyone as it rolled out the public beta version of its new generation mobile operating system called Android Nougat. While annual upgrades are more or less routine for Android by now, this year’s announcement came in pretty early as users had the option to avail and install an over-the-air beta update. Now, nearly six months later, Nougat has evolved out of the beta phase and landed on Google’s Nexus devices – Nexus Player, Nexus 5X, Nexus 6, Nexus 6P and Nexus 9 as well as the General Mobile 4G and the Pixel C tablet. Users with any of those mobile devices should be presented with an upgrade pretty soon – regardless of being enrolled in the public beta program or not. The first new generation smartphone that would come preinstalled with the Android Nougat will be the LG V20, which is arriving early next month. For now, you can register for the Android Beta program under the same Google account that the chosen device is using; select the smartphone or tablet that is to be enrolled, accept terms and join the Beta. It should be noted that the new firmware will be gradually rolled out to the public and may end up taking several weeks for it to arrive on all compatible devices. While Google boasts 250 new major features being housed by Android Nougat, a user would probably see only a few after booting their device following the update. One of the more obvious changes in the new operating system are the revamped notifications system and the new look is much closer to the guidelines set by the tech giant’s Material Design. Most applications will now enable the user to take action directly from the notifications such as archiving an email or replying to a message. The Quick Settings widget – the menu that you drag down by pulling it from the top – has also been redesigned. Among other changes, it is easier to reposition items without enabling the developer mode. Instead of pulling it all the way down, a slight swipe will show a compact view of the menu’s first five items. Swiping down all the way would display all options. Another new useful feature is the ability to toggle between two apps that have been used most recently. This can be done by double-tapping on the square button that shows the most recently used apps, known as the Overview button. Nougat also allows two applications to be viewed side-by-side or on top of each other. While Samsung and other manufacturers have come up with a similar feature in various Android skins, it’s a first for Google to put it in the OS itself. This particular feature would be more useful on the Pixel C tablet than on smartphones. The high-res screen with a big usable keyboard would yield high efficiency for productivity apps such as Microsoft Word, Google Docs and others. This works with virtually any application and doesn’t have to be separately enabled by developers. Android Nougat brings in several new features that won’t be obvious to the user right away but will enhance the overall experience. Thanks to an enhanced version of the Doze mode from the previous Android – Marshmallow – Nougat promised a longer battery life. Doze essentially puts the device into deep sleep to save battery once it is placed upside-down and left there for a while. In Nougat, Doze will be triggered if the user hasn’t used the device for some time. Similar to the power consumption aspect, Nougat also addresses the data consumption issue. The Data Saver Mode will be able to cut down the data that apps use in the background. While it will allow the device to receive push notifications from applications, they will be not allowed to download huge amounts of data. The search engine giant also promises faster booting time for Nougat and that the new OS is better at separating files for someone using the file-based encryption. Updates to the firmware will also be faster and less annoying. Rather than downloading an update, applying patches and optimizing apps, Android Nougat simply installs it in the background and restarting the device will simply shift it to the new version. Nougat brings good news for gamers as well, as Google has added support for the novel Vulkan standard – a new computing and graphics API. It also features the state-of-the-art virtual reality mode, Daydream, which is responsible for running VR apps smoothly. However, Daydream-ready headgears and smartphones aren’t coming in until later this year. Only Nexus smartphones and tablets as well as the General Mobile 4G can avail the update currently. Today, Android 6.0 Marshmallow powers 15% of all Android devices while Android 4.4 Kit Kat – three generations behind – is the most popular version with nearly 30% of total users. While Android 7.0 Nougat is not expected to alter these statistics significantly any time soon, it is an interesting upgrade which users should definitely try out. The timing couldn’t be any better as Apple will likely come up with a new version of its OS with the new iPhone expected in the last quarter of the year.

We have a quick step-by-step guide to help you download the latest Google OS for your compatible Nexus tablet or smartphone. Important Points To Remember Before updating your compatible Nexus device to the Android 7.0 Nougat OS, you may also want to back up all important data. To do this, just navigate to Settings > Backup & Reset and make sure that the Backup My Data, as well as Automatic Restore options are checked. Also ensure that you have sufficient free space for the update, which weighs 1.1 GB. Download the update on a stable Wi-Fi connection and make sure the device's battery is at least 50 percent.

However, according to The Verge's team, the Android 7.0 Nougat update is sent in a matter of seconds to the device. In case you do not get the alert on your Nexus device, you can also check for it manually by going to Settings > About Phone > System Update > Check Now. Android 7.0 Nougat brings with it several exciting features such as an improved Doze Mode, Data Saver feature, Split Screen, a quick reply system for apps and even a virtual game where you can catch cats.

By Alistair Charlton August 23, 2016 13:59 BST The latest version of Android, version 7 Nougat, is coming to handsets over the next six monthsReuters Google's annual update to Android for 2016 is called 7.0 Nougat and it is about to be available for everyone to download for free. The update is being pushed to Google Nexus smartphones and tablets right now, but owners of devices from Samsung, LG, HTC and other manufacturers will have to wait. How long they will be waiting varies between manufacturers. Here, we have grouped every major manufacturer together so you can find out when you're likely to get the update to Nougat. The time you will have to wait is due to manufacturers and mobile networks both making modifications to Google's stock version of Android before it is distributed to customers. Google Nexus devices Google began rolling out Android Nougat to Nexus devices on 22 August and it will arrive on your phone or tablet as a notification "over the coming weeks". The Nexus 6, Nexus 5X and Nexus 6P will all receive Nougat, along with the Nexus 9 tablet, the Nexus Player and the Pixel C laptop. New Nexus handsets are expected from Google before the end of 2016, and these will come with Nougat out of the box. Samsung The bad news for Samsung users is that you could be in for a wait. While Android 5 Lollipop started appearing a month after it was released by Google two years ago, 2015's Android 6 Marshmallow was still arriving in March 2016. All recent Samsung handsets and tablets are expected to receive the update. HTC HTC users are also likely in for a long wait, but at least there is a more concrete time frame here. As with previous years, HTC has promised it will provide Android 7 Nougat to customers within 90 days of launch, which this year was 22 August. This means by 20 November, every eligible HTC should have had the Nougat update pushed to it. HTC says the 10, One A9 and One M9 will receive the new software. HTC released the following statement on 25 August: "We're excited to receive final shipping Android 7.0 Nougat software from Google. We expect the update to begin rolling out to the unlocked HTC 10 in Q4, followed by unlocked HTC One M9, unlocked HTC One A9, and carrier versions of these devices." Sony Sony is expected to be one of the slowest manufacturers to bring Android Nougat to its handsets. Marshmallow was released by Google in October 2015, but didn't begin hitting Sony phones until March 2016 and even now, at the time of writing in August, some older handsets are still waiting. As a result, we don't expect to see Nougat on Sony phones until around February 2017. Sony says Android Nougat will be coming to the following Xperia devices: Z3+, Z4 Tablet, Z5, Z5 Compact, X, XA, XA Ultra, and X Performance. The Xperia Z3 and Z3 Tablet Compact, just two years old, are notable exceptions. Huawei Huawei doesn't make any such promises, but it also isn't known to hang around too long. Last year, the company launched the Mate 8 smartphone in November and that came with the latest Android pre-installed. A new Mate 9 phone, expected to be shown at the IFA technology show in September and released before Christmas, could well be Huawei's first Nougat handset. As for current and older handsets like the Huawei P8 and P9, these should receive Nougat in late 2016 or early 2017. LG The LG V20 will be the first non-nexus handset to run Android Nougat from new when it launches on 6 September. Following this, we expect the company to bring the update to other handsets relatively quickly, as it did with Marshmallow last year, which began rolling out in October and reached Europe by November. If LG follows a similar trajectory with Nougat, then plenty of customers will get the update before the end of 2016. However, those using older handsets may have to wait until early next year. Motorola Because Motorola doesn't do much to modify Google's software, Android updates come to its phones more quickly. Marshmallow began arriving in December 2015, just two months after it was released by Google, so this year we can expect Nougat to be ready by October. BlackBerry The newest player in the Android market, BlackBerry took a whole six months to bring the Marshmallow update to its first Android phone, the Priv. We can only hope the company speeds things up for the newly launched DTEK50. BlackBerry is rumoured to be releasing two new Android handsets in early 2017; hopefully these will come with Nougat out of the box. OnePlus Finally, Chinese phone maker OnePlus is expected to be the last manufacturer to embrace Nougat. Despite Marshmallow leaving Google in October 2015, it didn't arrive on the OnePlus 2 until June 2016, a full eight months later. With that as a yardstick, Android 7 might not land until April.

Skip to content Fone Arena The Mobile Blog Menu Main Site Phones Gadgets About Media Coverage Advertising Contact Tip Us Twitter FB Youtube How to get Android 7.0 Nougat OTA update instantly for your Google Nexus device Google last night started rolling out Android 7.0 Nougat OTA update for select Nexus devices and it will gradually roll out to Nexus 6, Nexus 5X, Nexus 6P, Nexus 9, Nexus Player, Pixel C and General Mobile 4G (Android One) users over the coming weeks. So if you have one of the above mentioned Google Nexus devices and cannot wait for the OTA update to roll out, but still want the OTA update earlier than others, here’s what you can do and Google will push out the OTA update instantly for your device. Step 1: Click on this link to Join Android Beta Programme and register with your existing Gmail account that is being used on the Nexus device. Step 2: After the successful login, scroll down to see the eligible Nexus device for the program (as in our case it was Nexus 5X). Step 3: Tap to enroll the Nexus device and you’ll see a confirmation pop-up message noting that “Device enrolled, Your device is now part of the Android beta programme! A system update will soon be offered to your device. You can check to see if an update is pending by navigating to Settings > About > System updates.” Important Note: Make sure you have your Nexus device connected to Wi-Fi for the update. Step 4: Usually after the Step 3, you will instantly see a notification for the System update availability of Android 7.0 asking you to download it. But in case you don’t see the update notification immediately then either check for manual update from Settings or wait for some time as Google says it takes up to 24 hours to send the update. Although we have seen updates rolling out way earlier than that, so you need not to worry. Step 5: Hit the download and let it finish as it will take some time. Once completed, just tap on the ‘Restart & Install’ button at the bottom right corner. The update size for the Nexus 5X is about 1.1GB (1171.5mb). The Android 7.0 Nougat system update brings the multi-window feature to all eligible Nexus devices and will improve battery life. Google notes that the update also includes August security patches for Android 7.0 Nougat.

Google’s latest OS Nougat out of beta; what’s new in Android 7.0? August 23, 2016  | Nishant Sharma Tweet | 0 Comments Google has rolled out the new version of its mobile operating system that tweaks the interface and packs in a host of performance-enhancement features. Christened Android 7.0 Nougat, the latest version is finally out of beta. It will be readily available to the Google’s own Nexus devices but others will have to wait a few months. The first new phone with the pre-installed update will be LG V20, which is likely to be released in September. There are nearly 250 major new features in Android 7.0 Nougat, Sameer Samat, vice president of product management, Android and Google Play, said in a statement. Here is a quick overview of the new Android 7.0 Nougat. Improved Notifications The first visible change in the Nougat is in the notifications. With the new template, users can swiftly reply to almost all communication-based notifications, with the quick reply function. Users can hit reply from the notification and type their message directly into the box. Multi-window Multi-window screen support, or side-by-side split (or on top of each other), is another additional feature to allow users to multitask on their smartphone. The feature was already there on Samsung and other devices, but this is a first on Google. Users even have the option to resize the split screen. The feature will be more useful in tablets and phablets, given their screen size. Still, it is a welcome addition for smartphones as well. Quick settings Google has redesigned the Quick settings Widget and has added Bluetooth, Wi-Fi and the flashlight in a single swipe. Users now can simply switch between two most recently used apps by simply double-tapping the overview button, making bouncing between two apps more swift. Battery improvement In Android 6.0, Google introduced the Doze feature which helps save battery life when the phone is stationary. In Nougat, Google has extended that feature while the phone is moving too, so the Doze will activate even when you are on the go. Faster, safer Google promises that your device will now boot faster and your data will be more secure. New features such as Seamless update, File-based encryption and Direct boot has been added for the task. Direct Boot will help your device start faster, and apps run securely even before you unlock your device when your device reboots. With seamless update, the new Android devices with Nougat can install software updates in the background. This means you won’t have to wait while your device installs the update and optimises all your apps for the new version. Also, with file-based encryption Nougat can better isolate and protect files for individual users on your device. Other notable changes include the addition of a feature for Virtual Reality mode called Daydream to ensure smooth functioning of VR apps. The update also includes a multi-locale support in the settings for the apps to tailor their content, and will be useful for multilingual users. Over the next several weeks, the Nexus 6, Nexus 5X, Nexus 6P, Nexus 9, Nexus Player, Pixel C and General Mobile 4G (Android One) will get an over-the-air software update to Android 7.0 Nougat. Any devices enrolled in the Android Beta Program will also receive this final version, Google said. Like this report? Sign up for our daily newsletter to get our top reports.

Android Nougat is being sent out to people’s phones around the world from today. It will initially arrive on Google’s own Nexus devices first, and soon arrive on the upcoming LG V20. Other phones will have to wait until their carriers and manufacturers decide to make it available – potentially leaving them open to big security problems. The new version of Android brings new features including better battery life, more emojis and virtual reality compatibility that sits alongside a whole host of VR tools. Google said that there are more than 250 major new features in the newest version of Android, which is officially version 7.0. But the primary new tools include expanded emoji, quick settings controls that can be easily accessed to change settings and the ability to run two apps side-by-side. All of the recent Nexus devices will be updated over-the-air, and others will come with time.

Samsung unveiled its third budget phone Z2 Tuesday in India after introducing the Z1 and Z3 last year. All three are based on the Tizen OS unlike the Android-backed Galaxy line. Speculation is growing that Samsung would adopt Tizen in premium phones by releasing the Z9 in the not-so-distant future so the OS can take center stage. Samsung has not confirmed this. However, market analysts and industry officials say that Samsung will eventually use Tizen for its top-tier phones. "If Samsung markets the Z9, it means the company will install Tizen not only in entry-level devices but also in high-end ones comparable to its Galaxy models and Apple's iPhones," a Seoul-based analyst said. "Google might regard it as a challenge to the supremacy of Android." In the global market for smartphone OSes, the duopoly of Apple's iOS and Google's Android has been in place for years, trailed by distant competitors like Microsoft's Windows, Nokia's Symbian and MeeGo. They have their own merits and demerits, but Android is the foremost player by any metric thanks in no small part to the popularity of Samsung's Galaxy products. Currently, Android accounts for about three-quarters of the global market while the market share of iOS is around 20 percent and the remaining OSes occupy very small shares. "Who decides what applications will be pre-installed on Galaxy handsets? The textbook answer would be that Google and Samsung would work together. But common sense tells us that Google almost single-handedly decides it and Samsung serves as a set-off," the analyst said. "In addition, it's not Samsung but Google that makes money through numerous developers of mobile applications. You can guess why Samsung desperately wants to make Tizen a mainstream software." He added that the dependence on Google's software also affects the development schedule of new Galaxy phones because they need to follow the schedule of Google's Android upgrades. Tizen is an open-source OS built by a community of developers. Samsung has played a pivotal role in the OS, which comes in multiple profiles to serve different industry requirements. Earlier this decade, Samsung worked on its own OS called Bada targeted for mid-range and top-end smartphones and tablet computers. But Bada-powered devices, branded under the Wave name, failed to make a dent in the international market. This prompted the tech giant to stop supporting Bada in early 2013 as Nokia did with Symbia and later MeeGo. The company then moved to Tizen for its Z-series gadgets. Google spokespeople were not available for comments. voc200@koreatimes.co.kr   'Romantic Doctor' tops 20 percent view... 'Openness to Korean cuisine helped gai...

There are over 250 major features in Android Nougat," Google V-P Product Management, Android and Google Play, Sameer Samat said. The new OS version will offer users more productivity options, better battery life and is said to be more secure than the previous avatars. The LG V20 will be the first non-Google smartphone to come with Android 7.0 Nougat out of the box. Nexus line of devices runs the Android operating system, with Google managing design, development, marketing and support of these devices. The manufacturing is carried out by original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). In the past, Nexus devices have been manufactured by OEMs like Motorola, HTC, Huawei and LG. Google names each major release version of Android after something sweet. The previous versions were Marshmallow, Lollipop, Kitkat, Jellybean, Ice cream Sandwich, Honeycomb, Gingerbread, Froyo, Eclairs and Donut.

The QuadRooter flaw, discovered by Check Point, could potentially give cyber attackers complete control over an Android device. The vulnerability was discovered in Qualcomm chips, which are used in smartphones and tablets made by Blackberry, LG, Google and more. This put up to 900 million devices at risk. The flaw was dubbed QuadRooter because there are four interconnected flaws which can be used to gain access to the “root” of the phone, the Guardian said. Patches to fix the flaw were made available quickly, and Check Point released an app called QuadRooter Scanner on the Google Play store which checked whether a device was at risk. However, new research has revealed that QuadRooter’s threat is still alive. Researchers at RiskIQ have found a number of malicious apps available for download on various app stores that claim to offer a fix for the flaw, but of course do nothing of the sort. One of these, called Fix Patch QuadRooter by KiwiApps Ltd was found in the official Google Play store. Although it was removed from there it popped up in a number of unofficial app stores, along with a number of others. In total, 27 malicious apps related to QuadRooter have so far been found. These have been found available for download in the official Google Play store, as well as others such as BingAPK, SameAPK, AppBrain, and AppChina. All these unofficial sources carry big risks to users and their devices. These unofficial, third-party app stores are a dangerous place; a lack of quality control means many applications are malicious, containing malware that can steal personal data. While these app stores may seem convenient for users, especially in countries where official apps may not be available, users should stick with the official Google Play Store wherever possible.

Image courtesy: Google Knock, knock! Google Duo video call is here NEW YORK, August 16, 2016 Now, all you need is a phone number to start a video call with any contact who uses an Android- or iOS-based smartphone. Google on Tuesday launched Google Duo, pitting it directly against Apple's FaceTime, which allows video calls only between Apple devices. Duo will also compete with Microsoft Corp's video-calling app Skype, Facebook's Messenger and even its own Hangout app. Duo comes with a unique feature called "knock knock", which lets a person to see live video of a caller before answering. (http://bit.ly/2bv08Un) Google said video calls would work even on slower networks by "gracefully" reducing the resolution to keep the call going smoothly. "For video calls on the go, Duo will switch between Wi-Fi and cellular data automatically without dropping your call," Justin Uberti, principal software engineer, wrote in a blog post. Google, owned by Alphabet, said the app would be live worldwide in the next few days.  - Reuters Tags: Google | duo | Video call | More IT & Telecommunications Stories Batelco launches Sophos security solutions Clikat launches home needs service app Aruba provides wi-fi at Gitex Technology Week Mobile networks reach 84pc of world population Ericsson program to cover 15 ME universities Menatelecom offers new 4G, LTE packages Microsoft to debut as lead technology partner at Big 5 Gulf Air IT chief wins top innovator award UAE satellite operator inks partnership with Talia Du launches new TV service on Apple TV Etisalat rolls out new IP address standard Batelco set to host telecom and IT experts New media, IoT ‘increase threats to media firms’ Bahrain to introduce new rules for phone masts Thuraya launches 'first' dual mode, dual SIM phone NDigitec opens lounge in Dubai Design District HK telecom group names new GM Ford signs up BlackBerry for security software Asiacell, IRC and Ericsson win top CSR award UAE re-elected as chair of global IoT study group Microsoft partners with start-up accelerator Batelco gets key Eutelsat teleport certification 5G set to be a game-changer for networked society Batelco hosts Injaz Bahrain board meeting Saudi tech start-ups to drive Digital Economy Batelco wins 'fastest mobile internet in Bahrain' award Investcorp to invest $20m in cloud firm Calligo Ooredoo to implement new Ericsson solution for billing Ericsson showcases tech studio to UAE team Cyber security to drive $7.6trn of digital value Calendar of Events View all events Tools Exchange Rates Weather Forecast BBC World Service Ads Sectors | Information | About Us | Construction & Real Estate Energy, Oil & Gas Finance & Capital Market Industry & Logistics IT & Telecommunication Health & Environment Motoring Retail & Wholesale Travel, Tourism & Hospitality Government & Laws Media & Promotion Back to top Trade News Newsletter Events Business Directory TradeArabia Network Advertising Contact Feedback Privacy Statement Terms of Service Web Feeds
CONTENT Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide POPULAR TOPICS Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Popular Topics  Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Twitter Google+ Facebook Youtube RSS Search SlashGear Search Google Allo will support expiring messages and encryption keys Shane McGlaun - Aug 23, 2016 3 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Back in May, we first talked about Google Allo, tipped early on to be a smart chat app. Now that the app has been around a while a new feature has surfaced that shows Google is thinking along the lines of Snapchat and offering users of the app the ability to send incognito messages and to send messages that automatically expire after a bit. The chats are end-to-end encrypted with each participant in the chat getting their own unique identity keys. There is a setting that will notify you when an identity key has changed. These keys are used to both identify people you are chatting with and to secure the messages sent. You can tell at a glance when you are in incognito mode because the background will be gray with a graphic on the side. Notifications are private during these chats and won’t give you an indication of what was sent in the message in case it is something you don’t want everyone to see. Incognito chats also don’t show previews of the last sent or received message unlike when you are having regular chats. If you are sending something you don’t want the person you are chatting with to be able to save, the expiration time is going to be your friend. With this feature, you can choose how long you want the person to be able to view the chat or content you have sent them. You can choose 5 seconds, 10 seconds, a minute, an hour, a day, or a week. You can also turn the timer off to allow them to view what you sent at any time. The app also disables the ability to take a screen shot of the chat or content. The catch with these expiration timers is that there doesn’t seem to be a way to know if the person received your chat and read it before it expired.

The Maryland kindergarten teacher, who spent eight months planning her special day, wasn't left at the altar. The altar left her. On Aug. 8, her 25th birthday and five days before her planned waterfront wedding, Sieminski arrived just before midnight to find a chained gate and a "No Trespassing" sign marring the pastoral venue, The Winery at Elk Manor in North East. The next morning, Sieminski and her family called every one of the couple's 125 guests to inform them that the wedding was off until further notice. "I think I cried at the beginning of every phone call," Sieminski recalled. She is among dozens of brides-to-be from across the mid-Atlantic who were forced to scrap or relocate their weddings and forfeit thousands of dollars after their venue closed and voided their contracts without notice. Apart from creating anguish for stressed-out couples, Elk Manor's move had a ripple effect on guests traveling from such far-flung locations as Australia, and on other wedding vendors, such as photographers, caterers and disc jockeys who had booked dates well in advance. More than 50 families are believed to be affected by Elk Manor's closing, including at least four in Delaware. Several are weighing legal options to recover their money from the winery's other limited liability companies, The Winery at Elk Manor LLC and Elk Manor Operations LLC, and well-heeled operators Simon Tusha, a former Google executive, and his wife, Gretchen. Over the last year, at least four couples have sued the Tushas for breach of contract in Maryland courts claiming damages in excess of $100,000. All four cases are still active. STORY: Closed bridal boutique leaves women dressless STORY: Catholic group protests Joe Biden officiating gay wedding  As recently as July 29, bank records show, Elk Manor accepted a $3,750 payment from the mother of one bride. On Aug. 2 — one week before the winery closed — Gretchen Tusha confirmed a pre-wedding photo shoot with another bride, according to an email obtained by The News Journal. As of Monday, the 151-acre winery property at 88 Rivers Edge Road was listed for sale for $9.9 million, nearly triple what it sold for in 2011 before it became a popular wedding venue. "A very unique gentleman's farm with a motivated seller," the listing says. Area venues and wedding planners have rushed to help victims, calling the winery's behavior highly unusual in an industry that specializes in fulfilling dreams at an average cost of nearly $33,000. "It's fairly uncommon," said Kristen Maxwell Cooper, executive editor of The Knot, who recommends brides stay calm and appoint a point person to deal with the logistics. The popular wedding website recently saw a jump in canceled venues due to catastrophic flooding in Louisiana. Venue fees account for one-third to half of all wedding spending, according to industry research. Newark Country Club recently waived rental fees for all Elk Manor couples. "I have heard of this happening once before in Pennsylvania with a bridal shop but never a venue," club manager Laura DelPercio said. The $58.3 billion wedding business, like any industry, is vulnerable to economic downturns and fly-by-night operators. Revenue volatility has increased modestly over the last five years due to high unemployment and economic uncertainty, leading couples to spend less or postpone their nuptials, according to a recent report by global research firm IBISWorld. Buy Photo  (Photo: DANIEL SATO/THE NEWS JOURNAL) "If a venue is only focused on weddings, then they're going to have a hard time competing in today's marketplace," said Shane McMurray, chief executive officer of The Wedding Report, which tracks industry trends. In May, Frederick County shut down the Shade Trees & Evergreens wedding venue after it was discovered that the owner had no building, zoning or septic permits. The owner, John Eyler, has since applied to demolish buildings on the property. The same month, Anastasia's Bridal in north Wilmington shuttered due to financial difficulties, according to court records, leaving more than a dozen brides without their designer gowns. Delaware Attorney General Matt Denn's office continues to investigate, according to an office spokesman. Across the country, reports roll in of banks foreclosing on ballrooms, code inspectors shutting down country clubs and catering halls declaring bankruptcy. More often than not, jilted couples are left holding the bag unless they pursue breach of contract claims or get in line with other creditors. "The odds are very, very, very slim" that they will collect, according to Atlanta-based attorney Rob Schenk, who edits an online legal resource for wedding service providers called WeddingIndustryLaw.com. He tweets once every other month about another wedding venue closing and recommends that couples buy wedding cancellation insurance to protect themselves. The Valley Dale Ballroom in Ohio stranded brides-to-be and concert promoters after shutting down abruptly last year.  (Photo: Google) Multiple Elk Manor brides and grooms interviewed by The News Journal didn't see the need for a safety net. By all appearances, the 163-acre winery on the Delaware border was a solid bet. The Tushas presented themselves as successful entrepreneurs, parents of two young girls who lived in a six-bedroom, five-and-a-half-bathroom mansion in Forest Hill that is now listed for sale at $1.45 million. If the Tushas successfully sell their private residence and the winery before the lawsuits are concluded, couples could go after a portion of the proceeds, according to Wilmington attorney David Finger, who is not involved in the case. If the properties don't sell before court judgments are issued, the couples could obtain liens on the property behind secured creditors like the IRS and mortgage lenders, Finger said. If there is no money left over, the couples are out of luck. Beginning in 2011, the Tushas transformed overgrown pastures once used to raise champion thoroughbreds into a sought-after wedding oasis down a two-lane road, past neighbors who had protested the increased noise and traffic. Homegrown white wines were expected to be available early next year and reds shortly after. Last spring, gray-haired men driving extravagant classic cars rumbled through the manicured grounds as part of the Chesapeake Concours show. Organization records show that Tusha registered to show five cars that day: three Lamborghinis, a Mercedes G63 and a McLaren 650s, the last of which retails for more than $265,000. STORY: They wed 17 years after their first kiss - in second grade STORY: They wanted a winter wedding. They got a blizzard.  A repurposed hay loft on site rented for $6,500 on a Saturday night, while the 1920s grand manor house, with its panoramic view of the Elk River, cost $9,500, according to the venue's still-functioning website. Under the tagline, "The only thing we overlook is the Chesapeake Bay," Elk Manor's calendar shows weekends booked solid through September. What couples didn't realize is that the gourmet French catering wasn't paid for, the centerpiece of their reception — an elaborate, two-story glass tent — sat in a heap for lack of county permits, and the Tushas and their associated businesses were in default on nearly $5 million in bank loans on the Rivers Edge Road property, according to Cecil County court and zoning records. The Maryland Attorney General's office is investigating how Elk Manor's clients can be made whole. In May, Simon Tusha, a former strategic negotiator for Google, pleaded guilty to a charge of conspiracy to defraud the United States, after failing to pay taxes on millions of dollars in payments from overseas companies competing for data center contracts with the tech giant. According to the federal complaint, Tusha and his co-conspirators hid the illegal income from the IRS through multiple shell companies, defrauding the government of nearly $1 million in taxes. Tusha, 43, remains free on $10,000 bond and his sentencing has been postponed until January; he faces up to five years in prison. Neither he nor his attorney would respond to repeated requests for comment. The winery's Facebook page is inactive, as is its phone line. In an earlier interview with the local newspaper, the Cecil Whig, Tusha said he received poor tax advice and that the payments under federal investigation were from personal projects not associated with Google. His legal entanglements don't end there. Earlier this month, lawyers for BB&T Bank argued in a lawsuit filed in Cecil County Circuit Court that the Tushas had violated the terms of their nearly $5 million Elk Manor loan. According to the complaint for confession of judgment, the couple made "materially false statements" around the initial closing of the loan last year, used loan proceeds for unauthorized purposes, and delayed filing required business and tax documentation. The Tushas, who personally guaranteed the loan, have yet to file a response, according to court records. Photo from a wedding held in May at the vineyard at Elk Manor Winery in North East, Md.  (Photo: Courtesy of Jim Coarse) The loan was secured under a U.S. Small Business Administration program that helps creditworthy small businesses obtain financing without the necessary collateral and lending history that is normally required by banks. As a result, taxpayers could be on the hook for as much as 75 percent of the loan after the Tushas' business and personal assets are sold, according to Baltimore SBA spokesperson Rachel Howard. In July, Rouge Fine Catering in Hunt Valley, Maryland – Elk Manor's preferred caterer for the past two years – filed a breach of contract suit in Cecil County Circuit Court arguing that the winery owed more than $215,000 under 28 separate catering agreements dating to April. Among them was Sieminski's now-canceled Aug. 13 wedding. Simon Tusha has not yet responded to the suit, according to court records. Just last week, Laura and Thomas Kemp, of Elkton, sued the Tushas and the LLCs overseeing Elk Manor for $7,900 plus court and legal fees for breach of contract for their October wedding. The Aug. 16 lawsuit in Cecil County District Court cites an Aug. 14 email by Jamie Barlow, who scheduled wedding receptions for the winery. "I am no way affiliated with Elk Manor or the Tushas any longer," the email reads. "I want to be completely honest with you in this email since I know that you haven't had that for the last few months. I advocated every day for you and all the other couples and was only provided with lies." Barlow could not be reached for comment. The Tushas have not filed a response, according to court records. In another lawsuit filed last year, a Woodlyn, Pennsylvania, couple accused Elk Manor of ruining their June 2015 wedding reception after their beach venue flooded. Buy Photo  (Photo: KYLE GRANTHAM/THE NEWS JOURNAL) The complaint by George and Samantha Schneider alleges that winery owners and agents refused to pump out the rainwater or sandbag the venue. Rather, they stood "drinking coffee and watched as guests and the caterer tried to prevent wedding gifts from floating away," the suit said. Meanwhile, bugs "started climbing on guests" and the disc jockey had to move several times to "avoid possible electrocution." The Schneiders and their attorney did not return phone calls. Elk Manor moved to dismiss those claims in February of this year, arguing in court documents that the plaintiffs failed to substantiate their allegations, did not show "what relationship, if any," the Tushas have with the Elk Manor LLCs and neglected to claim "actual malice" on the part of the defendants. In June, Cecil County Circuit Court Judge Jane Cairns Murray dismissed the couple's negligence complaint but allowed them to proceed with their breach of contract suit. Other affected couples, who have shared their stories on a dedicated Facebook group and through multiple media outlets, maintain that Tusha and his staff continued to accept deposits and reassure clients that Elk Manor would remain untouched by the federal lawsuit as recently as last month. After a jittery bride took to a Maryland wedding Facebook page expressing concerns about the venue's future, Tusha wrote in a July 1 post, "Elk Manor is fine and growing, not to worry." Bel Air attorney Camilla Rogers heard a similar story when she confronted Tusha last month about the future of her daughter's October wedding. "He told me unequivocally that Elk Manor was titled fully in the name of his wife and that he had made a deal with the feds that Elk Manor would not be touched," said Rogers, who purchased wedding insurance but has offered to represent other affected couples and their families. Maryland property tax records show that the Winery at Elk Manor LLC bought the property for $3.5 million last year from Elk Manor Farms LLC, which had purchased the property for $2.6 million in 2011. Simon Tusha is listed as the registered agent for both LLCs, according to state records. The winery's two state licenses were first registered to Gretchen Tusha in 2013. STORY: Inside the cult of the secret wedding pinners  STORY: He took dance floor alone at the wedding  Rogers, an estate lawyer, confessed that she didn't completely read her daughter's venue contract, in which the client relinquishes the right to sue and releases Elk Manor from liability "for events beyond their control," including acts of God and "governmental agencies." "Under no circumstances is the deposit/consultation fee or any other payment refundable," the contract reads. On Aug. 4 — five days before a winery representative emailed clients that the facility would close Aug. 9 "due to circumstances beyond our control" — Peggy Bowman of Townsend organized a walk-through of Elk Manor with her daughter's wedding photographer. "They never let on that anything was amiss," the Townsend office manager said. Bowman had made her final payment July 29. After losing $9,500, she is now considering erecting a tent in her backyard for her 23-year-old daughter's October wedding. Adding salt to Bowman's wounds, less than a week before Elk Manor officially closed, Tusha posted on his personal Facebook page pictures of him and his family vacationing in Maine and attending a Coldplay concert — "great seats"— in Philadelphia. Those posts have since been removed. In its Aug. 9 email, the winery, "aware of the detrimental impact this will have on our valued customers and friends," offered couples who had paid in full the option of continuing to rent the venue. In exchange, they were required to spend at least $1,000 more to hire staff that were supposed to be included under their original contract terms. Insulted by the offer, Sieminski booked another venue, White Clay Creek Country Club at Delaware Park, at a substantial discount. Her new wedding date is Nov. 12, which means she'll have to mail out new invitations, white-out August 13 on her programs, and find a way to incorporate her wine bottle centerpieces and breezy coral-and-white color palette into an autumnal, landlocked celebration. She's willing to do anything to erase her original date — and Tusha — from her memory: "When we look back 20 years from now, we don't want to see his face." Photo from a wedding held in May at the vineyard at Elk Manor Winery in North East, Md.  (Photo: Courtesy of Jim Coarse) Checks and balances As "one of the world's most experienced data center developers," Tusha highlights in his Linkedin profile that he has developed more than 150 data center projects totaling more than five million square feet of space over two decades. After studying aerospace engineering and working at Google in 2008 and 2009, he became a private consultant. In 1999, Tusha was sentenced to 10 months of prison and ordered to pay more than $130,000 in restitution for transporting stolen checks across state lines, according to U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware records. Later, he and/or his wife helped form multiple companies in several states, including in Delaware and abroad, exposing the couple to a flurry of lawsuits by clients, contractors and lenders. Simon Tusha's name is associated with at least nine addresses in Maryland over the past 16 years, according to public records. From 2007 to 2014, Harford County filed more than $20,000 in tax liens against Tusha, according to court records. He is now current on his taxes, a county spokeswoman said. Allrom Consulting is the listed owner of the Tushas' home at 1122 Walters Mill Rd., which federal agents claim was purchased, in part, using bribes from international companies. The sprawling property boasts garage space for six cars, a swim-up pool bar, movie room, Brazilian cherry hardwoods, a finished nanny bedroom and waterfall, according to a real estate listing. The Tushas are also listed in public records as officers with Below Charters LLC, offering luxury yacht charters. The company's registered agent is Harold Brubach, also known as Captain Lee on the Bravo reality series "Below Deck." Bravo did not respond to a request for comment. Photo from a wedding held in May at the vineyard at Elk Manor Winery in North East, Md.  (Photo: Courtesy of Jim Coarse) In Delaware, Tusha helped formed Tusha and Associates I LLC in 2013, which is listed as active but not in good standing after failing to pay its franchise fee last year. Nothing in Delaware law prevents Tusha, who has a criminal background, from forming a LLC, according to Rick Geisenberger, Delaware's Chief Deputy Secretary of State. "There is no background check," he said. "And if there were, as a practical matter, the whole formation process would take basically forever." In Cecil County, government officials were aware of Tusha's guilty plea in federal court, but didn't expect it to impact Elk Manor, according to County Council Manager James Massey. Zoning officials initially denied the Tushas' request to open a wedding venue on the property, which led the couple to open a winery that was permitted to host events. Like Delaware, Maryland doesn't scrutinize a service operator's court record across multiple states for the purposes of permitting. "Jack the Ripper could be here – as long as he dots his i's and crosses his t's," Conway said. Reached at his South Dakota home, Tusha's grandfather, Korean War veteran Marlin Tusha, called his grandson a "high roller," who grew up poor and is an only child. "He just doesn't seem to care to associate with the family," the 85-year-old said. "He  thinks he's better than the family. He has a very arrogant attitude." Buy Photo  (Photo: Margie Fishman, The News Journal) Dream day deferred Jocelyn Vargas considers herself one unlucky bride. After purchasing her Pronovias gown at the now-defunct Anastasia's and booking her October wedding at Elk Manor, she estimates her total losses to be more than $16,000. "I trust no one," the 29-year-old admitted. Like other brides, the Newark real estate agent was first alerted by Rouge Catering that the winery couldn't pay its bills. Still, Simon Tusha assured her in a July 25 email that "if you still want to use Rouge they will be allowed to cater your wedding" and asked whether she'd be sending her final payment to Rouge directly. The email was sent less than three weeks after Rouge sued Tusha for nonpayment. Vargas balked at paying an extra $12,500 on top of the more than $14,500 she had already paid. She met with a couple attorneys before Elk Manor shut down, she said, but was told it would be difficult to cancel her contract. She has since moved her wedding to a farm in Middletown. "People say that wedding planning is stressful," she said. "I didn't think it would be anything like this." Roughly an hour's drive from the Tushas' custom three-zone geothermal home, Sieminski's mother, a teacher's aide, and her father, a heating and air conditioning repairman, live in a pale blue house with vinyl siding in a community dotted with satellite dishes and basketball hoops. The family recently returned $2,000 in alcohol and canceled the Atlantic City bachelor party for Sieminski's fiance, Elijah Beckel. Earlier this year, they buried a $50 bottle of bourbon at Elk Manor, which, according to Southern folklore, is supposed to ward off rain on your wedding day. "We'll get it," Sieminski's older brother, Justin, vowed recently. And the other tens of thousands of dollars? "We'll take the money in $10 checks while he's in jail," he joked bitterly. His petite mom sat across from him, clenching her teeth. "My daughter is devastated. I'm sick over it," Sandy Sieminski said. "How can you pay for something — thousands of dollars — and get nothing back?" "We work for everything," she continued, visibly deflated. "I wanted her to have her dream wedding." Contact Margie Fishman at 302-324-2882, on Twitter @MargieTrende or mfishman@delawareonline.com. Planning a wedding? Protect yourself As in any industry, some wedding service providers are more scrupulous than others. From 2011 to 2015, nearly one-third of wedding insurance claims were related to problems with vendors, according to a study by Travelers Insurance. Of those, 64 percent involved venue issues. Protect yourself (and your deposits) with these tips from the experts: • Stick to your budget and resist the upsell. At the same time, avoid low-ball bids. • Get all terms in writing (dates, services provided, prices, cancellation and refund policies), and read all the fine print. Make sure all parties sign the contracts. • Try to negotiate smaller deposits to reduce the likelihood of no-show contractors. Whenever possible, pay with a credit card, which can offer added protection if a vendor reneges on a contract. • Seek out personal recommendations and do your due diligence in researching the backgrounds of your vendors. Check records from the Better Business Bureau and local courthouse. Contact references. Read customer reviews. • Purchase wedding cancellation insurance, which can help you recoup deposits paid to businesses that close abruptly or replace damaged goods. • If all else fails, report complaints to the local Better Business Bureau and the state attorney general's office. You can also file a civil claim for breach of contract. In bankruptcy cases, you will need to contact the court clerk for a "proof of claim" form. But legal experts warn that chances are slim that you'll ever see your money. 713 CONNECTTWEET 20 LINKEDIN 8 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://delonline.us/2bRw2N2 TOP VIDEOS Who is Nikki Haley? 1:30 Athlete of the Week: Victoria Taylor 0:56 Diverging diamond traffic pattern coming to Del. 1 & 72 1:37 911 call: I'm being attacked by bear; I'm going to die 1:05 Pedestrian killed in Philadelphia Pike crash 0:34 Female student excels as football coach 2:32 Bancroft Mills fire continues to burn underground 1:02 Students choosing culinary arts as careers 1:13 Salesianum withdraws plans to lease, improve Baynard Stadium 0:50 Bear students take part in Mannequin Challenge 1:06 Joe Biden Biden ‘not interested’ in running for DNC chair JOSH LEDERMAN Progressives must find the road back to Factville Jared Bernstein Photo of man robbing Canterbury Shore Stop released Esteban Parra The man behind Biden-pranking-Trump memes Ryan Cormier Wilmington 21-year-old questions mayoral age requirement Christina Jedra Officials celebrate 'effective end' to veteran homelessness Xerxes Wilson This story is part of Joe Biden Biden ‘not interested’ in running for DNC chair Progressives must find the road back to Factville Photo of man robbing Canterbury Shore Stop released

There’s nothing wrong with your unit, and it won’t suddenly expire. It’s just that Google’s latest major Android release does not support the old hardware. DON’T MISS: This is our first look at one of the two brand new PS4 consoles launching next month Google on Monday released Android 7.0 Nougat, exactly as rumored a few days ago, but the new mobile operating system isn’t compatible with older devices. Of course, we already knew that from Google’s previous announcements and the fact the Nexus 5 was not included in the Android 7.0 beta. So if you were expecting a miracle, then you’ll be disappointed. The Nexus 5 is too old to receive Android update, even if there are plenty of users who still have one. Sure, the Nexus 5 probably has what it takes to run Nougat, and you might even be able to install a custom Android version based on Android 7.0 at some point in the future. But, officially, Google will not provide support for it. That means the oldest Nexus phone that will still receive software updates (mind you, we’re not talking about security updates) is the Nexus 6 phablet. If you’re looking to learn more details about Nougat or grab the necessary download files for newer hardware, follow the links in the source section. As for flashing a Nougat-based custom ROM on that amazing Nexus 5 of yours, well, you’ll have to wait, or figure out a way of doing it yourself.

Founded in July of 2006 with just two people and the goal of making MySQL faster and more reliable, Percona now employs over 150 staff members in 29 countries and has more than 3,000 customers. Percona is the only company delivering enterprise-class open source software, support, consulting and managed services for both MySQL and MongoDB across traditional and cloud-based platforms. The company's enviable international reputation for a growing list of award-winning open source products, its unparalleled customer support and consulting expertise, the most widely-read database performance blog, and its highly popular international Percona Live Open Source Database Conferences are why companies continue to trust Percona with their mission-critical database infrastructures. 10 Years of Highlights Company Founding and Growth In 2006, Peter Zaitsev and Vadim Tkachenko co-founded Percona. Together they have grown the company from a two-person shop offering independent consulting services for MySQL performance to one of the most respected open source products and services companies in the industry. Percona is served by more than 150 people in 29 countries, with more than 3,000 customers and a 35 percent CAGR over the past 3 years. Over the years, the company has continued to expand its offerings, adding: Open Source MySQL Software, including Percona Server for MySQL, a drop-in replacement for MySQL, along with Percona XtraDB Cluster, Percona XtraBackup and Percona TokuDB, each delivering high performance and high availability for optimal cloud operations. Open Source MySQL Database Tools, including Percona Toolkit, a collection of advanced open source command-line tools for a variety of MySQL and system tasks, and Percona Monitoring Plugins, components that add enterprise-class MySQL monitoring and graphing capabilities to existing on-premises monitoring solutions. Open Source MongoDB Software, including Percona Server for MongoDB, a drop-in replacement for MongoDB, and Percona Memory Engine for MongoDB®, the first open source in-memory computing storage engine to work with a MongoDB variant. Managed Services and RDBA for MySQL and MongoDB. Enterprise-wide Customer Support for MySQL, MariaDB and MongoDB, an industry-leading support option that eliminates the need for customers to count or audit servers and includes a tier with a guaranteed, money-back SLA. Consulting Services for optimization, infrastructure and design, high availability, upgrades and migrations, and server and database automation. MySQL Community Contributions by Percona staff, with innovative MySQL tools and books on MySQL-related topics of interest to community members. Acquisitions In 2015, Percona acquired Tokutek, including the Tokutek distribution of MongoDB, TokuMX, becoming the first vendor to offer both MySQL and MongoDB software and solutions. The acquisition also included TokuDB, the open source, high-performance storage engine for MySQL and MariaDB, making Percona the exclusive global licensee of the Fractal Tree® indexing technology developed by MIT, Stony Brook, and Rutgers Universities. Fractal Tree indexing delivers a breakthrough in storage compression and read/write performance by replacing B-tree indexing -- still used in virtually all database management systems -- with Fractal Tree indexing to dramatically improve database performance, reduce database size, and increase operational efficiency without significant application or infrastructure changes. Percona Live Conferences In 2011, O'Reilly and Associates announced it would stop hosting its MySQL Conference & Expo, which had been an annual Silicon Valley event since 2003. Instead of letting the longstanding tradition fade away, Percona undertook the challenge -- and the industry leadership role -- of hosting the event, producing the first Percona Live MySQL Conference and Expo in April of 2012. The conference was enthusiastically received by more than 1,000 attendees and was hailed by many as "the best MySQL event in years." The conference has continued to thrive. Percona began offering a second highly popular conference in Europe. In 2015, Steve Wozniak, "The Woz," spoke at the U.S. conference, and in 2016, the event was expanded to the Percona Live Open Source Database Performance Conference with a keynote by Bill Nye "The Science Guy." Partners Percona has established key strategic partnerships with a number of industry leaders, including: SolarWinds to provide SolarWinds® Database Performance Analyzer (DPA) for MySQL with Percona Server software and associated support and services in order to help customers optimize database and application performance and reduce hardware requirements. Amazon Web Services™ (AWS) to facilitate customers taking advantage of Amazon Database Services for fully-managed, low-cost, and scalable relational, NoSQL, and Caching services in the cloud; Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS) for a fully-featured and easy to operate relational database; Amazon DynamoDB for a fully-managed NoSQL database service that provides fast, predictable performance with seamless scalability; and Amazon ElastiCache for a fully-managed in-memory caching service that is protocol-compatible with Memcached. Google Cloud SQL to offer industry-leading MySQL database performance on Google's cloud infrastructure. Running Percona Server and Percona XtraDB Cluster in the Google Cloud enables developers to build, test and deploy applications on Google's highly scalable and reliable infrastructure. Management and monitoring providers, including Severalnines, VividCortex and Webyog, to offer automation, management and monitoring for open source databases and clusters. Awards Percona has consistently earned industry recognition for excellence and innovation, including: Named to the 2016 Inc. 5000 with a rank of #3400 and a three-year growth rate of 96 percent -- the fourth year in a row Percona was named to this list. Awarded a 2016 Bronze American Business Stevie Award in the "Company of the Year, Computer Software, Up to 500 Employees" category. Named a DBTA Readers' Choice Awards 2015 Winner for Best Database Backup Solution for Percona XtraBackup.

Through rapid growth and technology advances over the last 10 years, we've not only provided our customers with the responsiveness and expertise they need, but also justified their trust in depending on us to help optimize and scale their mission-critical infrastructures.

They are a core component of everything we are trying to do, and they are the absolute perfect fit to Wellcentive's vision for the future. We use the entire toolset from Percona and depend on their monitoring, troubleshooting, and their knowledge to help us achieve our goals. One of the most amazing things about Percona is the fact that working or speaking with them is not like speaking with a contractor, co-worker or stranger...the best way to describe the interaction is like speaking with family. Percona is a truly unique partner and one that we at Wellcentive cherish." Daniil Bazhenov, Chief Technical Officer at Simtech Development, Ltd. "The product and the level of services of the Percona team really inspires. I wonder how they manage to sustain this level of professionalism for so many years. When it comes to development of global-scale services, this is what the partner should be like. We thank Percona for being the company we can always rely on."

The new release is available now on recent Nexus devices, although 2013's Nexus 5 is excluded. The update will roll out to more phones in the coming months. Android Nougat has come a long way since Google first unveiled it back in March. The company claims there are over 250 major features in Nougat, including virtual reality, an updated interface, more powerful notifications and greater security. In a blog post, it emphasised some of the most notable additions. For the first time, Android now supports split-screen multitasking, allowing you to run two apps side-by-side on your phone or tablet. You can enter this mode from the recent apps menu. Once you've got multi-window enabled, you can resize the amount of space given to each app by dragging the divider between the two. Android 7.0 Nougat multi-window Google Notifications have been enhanced for the third year running. It's now possible to reply directly to notifications, letting you respond to a text message straight from the notification. This makes it easier to keep watching a video or playing a game while replying to a message as you don't need to leave the app. The Quick Settings panel in the notification tray has also received attention. You can now customise your tile layout and move tiles around in the tray. You can put your most used tiles at the top, adding and removing quick settings as you see fit. Combined with the notification and multitasking improvements, Google says it'll make you more productive on your phone. Under the hood, Android has been overhauled to be less battery intensive, more secure and capable of supporting advanced new technologies. It includes the Vulkan 3D rendering API, giving next-generation games more stable performance and better graphics. Android 7.0 Nougat Quick Settings Google Google has also built a virtual reality platform into the core of Android. Although not yet available on any current phone, Daydream allows you to use virtual reality headsets and controllers with any supporting handset, delivering immersive mobile VR experiences. None of these features would be useful if they immediately drained your phone's battery. To ensure this isn't the case, Google has updated Doze, the battery-saving feature introduced with last year's Marshmallow, to save even more power. It now automatically enters a power-saving state whenever the display is turned off, eking out every last percentage of your battery to maximise runtime. Finally, the security around Android has been enhanced with more advanced encryption, a safer startup procedure and additional protections around the kernel. As part of this work, Google has overhauled how Android installs updates. These are now done seamlessly in the background, meaning you never have to wait for an update to install and get your apps ready. Android 7.0 Nougat emoji Google Android 7.0 has already begun to roll-out to the Nexus 6, Nexus 5X, Nexus 6P, Nexus 9, Nexus Player, Pixel C and Android One devices. Notably absent from the list are 2013's Nexus 5 and Nexus 7, extraordinarily popular Nexus devices that are no longer supported by Google. The first phone to launch with Android Nougat preinstalled will be the upcoming LG V20. Shortly afterwards, Google is expected to introduce its 2016 range of Nexus hardware, possibly including a unique launcher interface designed to emphasise Android Nougat features. Beyond that, new phones from a myriad of manufacturers will arrive with Android Nougat in the next few months. For people who don't own a Nexus and aren't intending to buy a new phone, it may be a long wait to get Nougat. The majority of Android phones won't ever see the update, due to the fragmentation of the Android ecosystem. As Google unveiled Android 7.0 yesterday, almost 50% of all Android users were still running a version older than 5.0 Lollipop. Just 15.2% of devices are running 6.0 Marshmallow, the only version that has a chance of getting a direct upgrade to Nougat. Android 7.0 Nougat Google Nougat may introduce a lot of positive changes to the Android ecosystem but it's not going to be the release to solve Google's structural problems. It's likely to be the same story over the next few months as Marshmallow faced a year ago. Market share will drag along at a few percentage points each month, as manufacturers update a handful of year-old devices each to the new OS. No brand has yet confirmed its Nougat upgrade plans but you can be confident that few low-end and mid-range devices will ever see the new release.
