How do I move my photos to it? ~Charlyce Friday Tech+ Glad you asked! Google Photos, formerly known as Picasa, is a feature built into a user’s Google/Gmail account. If you’re on your laptop and logged into Gmail, look for the nine tiny squares near the top right of your screen. Those are other Google features you have access to. If you don’t see “Photos,” which looks like a rainbow pin wheel, click the “More” until you see photos. It’s also available here: photos.google.com. Screen captureHow to back up fresh photos on an iPhone using the Google Photo app? Just turn on “Back up & sync” in the app’s settings. You can stash photos here while on your computer. Or add fresh photos using the mobile app, available for Android and iOS phones. After you download the app, the installation takes you through the process of linking to your Google account. When you open it for the first time, the app will ask permission to access your photos (say yes!), and whether it should back them up to your account (yes again). Say “no” to backing up via cellular connection (that will use up all your mobile data) so Google Photos limits backup when the phone is connected over Wi-Fi. Google also offers free unlimited storage if you opt for lower resolution photos. Once backed up, photos on the phone can be accessed on a computer by going to the same Google Photos feature — or any device that you have signed in to Google. Watch me set up Google Photos on my iPhone in a new Tech+ video that will be posted at dpo.st/techplus on Monday. Apple’s iCloud doesn’t offer an Android app, though there are third-party apps that will sync an Android phone with a user’s iCloud account. But if you use Apple’s Cloud storage, which offers the first 5 GB for free, you can set photos to automatically back up to the cloud by going to “Settings,” then “iCloud” and “Photos.” Users will see four options on how the phone should back up items to the cloud. If you prefer an independent app not made by the company that makes your phone, there’s Dropbox (dropbox.com/mobile). To add automatic backup, go to “settings” and turn on “camera uploads.” Additional details at  dpo.st/dbsave. Amazon — yes, the retailer — also offers cloud photo storage. The company has a huge web services division so its Amazon Cloud Drive shouldn’t be a surprise. Amazon Photos, available in Android and iOS, is free for Amazon Prime users and starts at $11.99 a year for everyone else. It can be set to automatically upload new photos to Amazon’s cloud. For the most part, find the photo app’s settings and look for auto-save or backup. See past Tech+ answers or ask your own tech question at dpo.st/mailbag.

Follow TechnoBuffalo Google introduced the masses to virtual reality with Cardboard. Now it’s gearing up to take a big step forward with Daydream, and that means rethinking how people should interact in VR by discouraging aggressive behavior and encouraging positive actions like high fives. A series of experiments from Daydream Labs show how the company is rethinking physical interactions for virtual reality. That includes a goofy poker app where you play as dogs, a shopping simulation, and a high-fiving feature. In each situation, Google put tons of thought into how the software guides you actions. The high-fiving feature is pretty simple. If you and a friend (or stranger) successful high five or fist bump in Daydream VR you’ll hear a slapping sound and see a fireworks animation. Other actions, like punching the other person’s avatar, won’t do anything, which subtly encouraging you to high five instead. The poker app focuses on a similar issue, using animations to protect your personal space from other players. If you get up from your seat at the table the colors drain from the room and an oval of light urges you to sit down in the same spot. Google says that keeps people from getting too close to their opponents and potentially making them feel uncomfortable. Finally, the shopping game shows one way VR interactions can go wrong. The app, which Google designed for the HTC Vive, lets you and another person try on virtual hats and sunglasses. You can put these items on the other person too, but there’s no way to remove something placed by another person. That made it possible to ruin the experience by covering your friend’s eyes with a hat, forcing them to remove the headset entirely. When Daydream finally launches this fall we expect to see similar solutions baked into Google’s VR software. We still don’t know exactly when the new platform will launch, but you can watch all the videos below in the meantime.

image/svg+xml MAGAZINE EVENTS PAPERS TOPICS SEARCH Network Municipal Wireless: Making the Case for Wireless/Wired Hybrid Infrastructure Building a hybrid fiber/wireless infrastructure can go a long way to quickly get community broadband benefits to urban and rural areas. by Craig Settles / August 12, 2016 0 Despite the fact that AT&T and Verizon stores are abundant in many neighborhoods, it doesn’t take much to show that large incumbents do not adequately serve urban communities. Many cities — such as Columbus, Ohio; Santa Monica, Calif.; and Longmont, Colo. — build better, faster, cheaper networks and offer better customer service. Tom Spear, CEO of network infrastructure services provider enfoPoint Solutions, said he believes boosting competition can help. “As soon as Google announced they planned to provide gigabit to Nashville," he said, "that was the first time Comcast indicated they could provide a gig to their business customers.” RELATEDCombination of Need, Cost and Innovations Are Rekindling the Muni Wireless Dream And Google's recent news about its move into the wireless world highlights how Google, municipalities and others can bring stronger competition to incumbents. Many elected officials and community leaders in Tier 1 and Tier 2 cities get righteously giddy about the prospect of becoming the next gig city — until they get the estimated price tag. “If cities were to step back from their conventional fiber-centric way of thinking, they could build infrastructure with a fraction of the cost of traditional fiber and still deliver gigabit service citywide,” said Derick Lee, CEO of PilotCity. “The innovations in wireless are phenomenal.” Building a hybrid fiber/wireless infrastructure can go a long way to quickly get community broadband benefits to urban and rural areas. Benefits to government can be quick In 2004, Philadelphia estimated it could have saved $2 million a year by replacing incumbents’ cellular services for its 2,000 mobile city government workers and 300 remote offices. The city would have instead paid $20 per month to lease wireless services from Wireless Philadelphia (now defunct), a nonprofit created by the city, as well as eliminated T1 lines to the city’s remote facilities. Also at that time, Houston contemplated purchasing smart parking meters. But rather than paying $80,000 each month to buy cellular wireless access for the meters to work, the city figured it could build a Wi-Fi network and eliminate those recurring costs. Officials estimated that payback would happen in eight months, and the savings beyond that could underwrite the network’s operations costs. Fast forward to 2016. Wireless-enabled mobile city employees, remote offices and smart parking meters can yield similar results. New smart city services or products manage and distribute transportation, energy, parking, public safety, wastewater management and other resource management data using hybrid infrastructure. Columbus has installed 400 square miles of fiber cable, including a fiber cable going to every traffic light. It’s easy to imagine adding access points capable of delivering 100 or 200 megabytes of speed to its mobile workers. The city of Austin, Texas, plans to convert its park-and-ride system into a central hub for a variety of smart transportation options such as buses, car sharing, automated taxis and bike sharing. Vendor Olidata Smart Cities and the city of San Leandro, Calif., use an Internet of Things app and a microgrid to manage carbon emission reductions and energy security. Hybrid infrastructure facilitates health-care delivery In hospitals, patients' initial examinations could be conducted by doctors in different cities who view high-definition online video via fiber networks. Family and friends could visit wirelessly with a loved one who's admitted to a hospital in a neighboring state. And patients' rehab and recovery could be improved using Internet-based software to access medical personnel, online content and patient-to-patient collaboration. For resource management in medical facilities, broadband, sensors, RFID systems and Wi-Fi are key —and the data for thousands of patients must be kept secure on fiber networks. Wireless functionality increases hospitals’ ability to manage everything from beds to wheelchairs to heart pumps, preventing theft and ensuring the productive use these resources. This helps health-care facilities’ financial sustainability and quality of care. Some of these same technologies also are critical for patient management. Jory Wolf, former CIO for the city of Santa Monica, Calif., said he sees broadband helping injured people at accident scenes to receive doctor-supervised treatment. A nurse can schedule surgery facilities in several hospitals, and put people and resources in place while waiting for the final decision on where the patient will end up. “We could use wireless to transport data from the ambulance,” he said. “Patients when they arrive would get through the ER faster or actually go directly to their ultimate hospital treatment area.” Resolving digital inclusion challenges The innovation that is driving wireless makes it a great tool for digital inclusion efforts. Sometimes it is the skillful use of technology and ingenuity when developing business models that can help to close the digital divide. Mobile hot spots from Mobile Beacon offer average download speeds of 8 to 10 Mbps and have no data caps. Nationwide, 75 libraries are pilot-testing them, letting patrons borrow the units for several weeks or up to a year before having to return them. The New York Public Library, for example, ordered 10,000 hotspots to distribute in its 92 locations. Ron Deus, CEO of Cleveland's WISP NetX, offers 1 gig wireless, and said he finds that with Wi-Fi or point-to-point/multipoint, wireless infrastructure is cheaper than fiber. His business customers can make his ROI numbers, and at the same time, he can service low-income customers at a price they can afford. “Given this flexibility, we are experimenting with different business models, different pricing, maybe even different service levels, to figure out which variables works," Deus said. "We look at online funding options, public partnerships, potentially free access for some, pay-as-you-go type of service for others.” Whether a community network’s customers are individuals, companies or organizations, give them gigabit wired or wireless, and they will be happier, more productive users. “Gigabit wireless technology that lowers capital and operating costs while raising power efficiency, operating distance and connection security will accelerate the deployment of gigabit speed broadband throughout San Leandro and America,” said San Leandro Chief Innovation Officer Deborah Acosta. “If NASA can operate the Mars Land Rover from Earth, we should be able to figure out how to deploy this technology here on Earth!” Craig Settles Contributing Writer Craig Settles assists communities with developing their broadband business and marketing plans, and help communities raise money for broadband projects.

It’s all well and good when it’s done, but the process is beyond irksome (to put it mildly) to the locals — not to mention darn expensive for broadband providers as well (to put it mildly). So, how much of that sting can be minimized by wireless broadband options? The interest around that issue has had the internet a bit aflutter in the last few days caused by an FCC filing by Google on Aug. 5. In that redacted document, the company asks for authorization “to operate in and adjacent to the 3550-3700 MHz band that has been opened for innovative small-cell spectrum sharing by CBRS devices. Google requests authorization to operate on frequencies down to 3400 MHz and up to 3800 MHz so that [REDACTED]. Authority to operate in this range will ensure that Google has access to sufficient spectrum for experimentation while avoiding interference to incumbent operations.” Google further requests authorization to conduct testing in up to 24 U.S. areas. It reveals plans to deploy initially in California in Atwater, Mountain View, Palo Alto, San Bruno, San Francisco and San Jose as well as in Boulder, Colo., Kansas City, Kan., Omaha, Neb., Raleigh, N.C., Provo, Utah and Reston, Va. Business Insider was the first to break the news about the filing. A Google spokesperson told Business Insider: "We are working to test the viability of a wireless network that relies on newly available spectrum. The project is in early stages today, but we hope this technology can one day help deliver more abundant internet access to consumers." In related news, according to a recent San Jose Mercury News article, Google told two Silicon Valley cities that it is putting its ultra high-speed service plans on ice while the it looks into a less expensive option. That newspaper reports the company planned to begin digging in San Jose last month, “but nearly 100 employees hired to install Google Fiber were pulled into an office and told the project was being delayed, according to workers.” Broadband Related Reads AT&T Expands GigaPower Service in Bay Area Google's Internet-Beaming Balloons To Take Off In Indonesia Briefs: Eutelsat, Siklu, TVT, Huawei Google Self-Driving Car Strikes Bus on California Street Laura Hamilton Editor @cedmagazine Full Bio > Advertisement Advertisement View the discussion thread.

Of course, Google Fiber was serious and has rolled out in many venues. Now, it seems, Google may be anticipating a significant change of direction for Google Fiber. The San Jose Mercury News says that Google may be shifting from a wireline- to wireless-dominated approach in San Jose, Mountain View and Palo Alto, California. The most definitive sign that the company may be thinking that wireless is better is in San Jose. Almost 100 workers slated to begin the wireline build were taken off the job. An installer said that they were told that the change was made because Google is “thinking of going aerial,” the story says. Google parent Alphabet has acquired Webpass, which offers advanced wireless technology. Quadrooter Could Affect 1 Billion Devices The first sentence of Recode’s story on the malicious Quadrooter app pulls no punches: Another big security flaw in Android highlights just how messed up the Google ecosystem still is when it comes to security. Quadrooter, which was found by Check Point, could affect top of the line Android devices that use Snapdragon chips from Qualcomm. The chips are used in very common devices; as many as a billion devices could be at risk. Android’s process is cumbersome. After Google updates Android, device makers must customize the update for their phones. The update could come from chipmakers, not Google itself, which further complicates the process. The updates have to be tested before being released to the public. The result is that an inordinate amount of time is spent between when a problem is identified and a solution distributed. Great Days for Software-Defined Wide-Area Networks Software-defined wide-area networks (SD-WANs) are getting a lot of traction. Network World reports on three recent announcements: EarthLink inked a partnership with vendor VeloCloud, Verizon signed with Viptela, and CloudGenix announced a partnership program aimed at helping customer SD-WAN buildouts. IDC research cited in the story indicates that 30 percent of enterprises plan to migrate to SD-WANs within two years. The piece is fairly technical, but the bottom line is that the traction SD-WANs are getting is the result of their ability to better handle the much more fluid and diverse needs of modern telecommunications and IT networks. DOCSIS 3.1 Going Full Duplex A drawback the cable industry has always faced is that its download capacity – from the headend to the customer – was far greater than the upload. It has spent years trying to compensate for this weakness. A big step toward alleviating the problem is here. Light Reading reports that industry consortium CableLabs is working on an official specification that will provide full duplex Data Over Cable Service Interface Specification (DOCSIS) at 10 Gigabits per second (Gbps). DOCSIS 3.0 is designed to operate at 10 Gbps downstream and 2 Gbps upstream. DOCSIS 3.1, under the new spec, would offer 10 Gbps in both directions. The story adds that Cisco has submitted a plan suggesting what that element of DOCSIS 3.1 should look like. Easing Deployments in Historic Buildings The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has signed an agreement with the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation and the National Conference of State Historic Preservation Officers that will eliminate historic preservation review for small equipment installations that don’t affect building integrity. Distributed antenna systems and 5G deployments fit the description of the types of installations that will be streamlined. The FCC said in a statement that it expects the pact will reduce the cost and the amount of time it takes to install equipment in historical buildings.

Photo: Flickr By Ethan Baron, The Mercury News Google's plan to at least temporarily suspend its fiber program and experiment with high-speed wireless internet delivery in Silicon Valley is the latest sign of how the search giant is playing a key role in jump-starting cheaper, faster service around the country. Google has done that, in part, by pushing competitors like AT&T and Comcast to move faster in boosting internet speed. While Google may be coming out ahead in this clash of titans — faster and more widespread internet service means more clicks on Google ads — the clear winner is the public, as the best and most affordable Internet service is delivered to more and more customers across the U.S., analysts said. "You really have to take your hat off to them," said analyst Roger Entner of Recon Analytics. "They're doing everything really, really well. Google can gently or directly make other companies move in the direction that benefits (Google)." In a filing last week to the Federal Communications Commission, Google revealed that the firm plans to secretly test wireless delivery of ultra-high-speed internet in San Jose, Mountain View, Palo Alto and other U.S. locations. The revelation followed news that Google's plan to roll out super-speedy fiber service in cities across the country has largely been put on hold, after it successfully pressured Comcast, AT&T and others to accelerate their own plans for lightning-fast Internet. "It's a very big deal," said Blair Levin, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. "From a public policy perspective, this is a great game. We're doing more on the Internet and because of this we'll be able to do it better and faster and cheaper." And that plays right into Google's advertising-based business model. "The faster the internet connection that the customers have, the more money Google makes from selling advertising," Entner said. "So they are building these networks first with fiber to basically get everybody else moving." In a statement, Google said it is testing "the viability of a wireless network that relies on newly available spectrum. The project is in early stages today, but we hope this technology can one day help deliver more abundant Internet access to consumers." In its FCC filing, the company said it was keeping its workforce generally in the dark about the wireless program, with involvement only on a "need to know" basis. Third-parties working on the project have had to sign "robust" nondisclosure agreements, Google said. The firm also asked the FCC for redactions to public filings to protect information of "significant commercial value." Google blew the starting whistle on the great internet-service race by rolling out superfast Google Fiber in Kansas City in 2012 and inviting other cities to apply for the program, Levin said. More than 1,000 cities wanted in. The move by Google shook up the telecommunications and cable companies, which had for several years been simply harvesting users rather than improving internet service, Levin said. A year later, when Google Fiber moved into Austin, Texas, AT&T and Time Warner responded by announcing increases to Internet speeds in Austin. "In 100 percent of the cities where (Google has) announced a fiber build the telco (telecommunications company) has announced an upgrade to fiber and almost 100 percent of the cable guys have said they're going to do it as well. In this game, Google is a likely winner no matter what," Levin said. Cable operators including Comcast have reacted to Google's moves by using new technology that allows them to boost data-transmission speeds tenfold with modifications to cable hardware and distribution of new modems to customers, Entner said. Some analysts questioned whether Google ever wanted to get in the business of laying fiber. "Digging up streets is definitely not Google's thing," Joel Espelien of The Diffusion Group said earlier this week. "Wireless is definitely much more kind of up their alley." Google's experimentation with wireless internet delivery is intended both as a means for the company to more cheaply reach users with its own high-speed service, as well as an incentive to its competitors to extend ultra-high-speed Internet to areas where fiber deployment is cost-prohibitive, such as rural regions, Entner said. "They want to provoke exactly the same response so that the high-speed internet is not just in the big cities but everywhere," Entner said. "For Google, it doesn't matter who provides the fast service." But purely in terms of Internet speed, wireless remains inferior to fiber, Entner said. "One strand of fiber has more capacity than the entire wireless spectrum," he said. The three Silicon Valley cities were chosen for wireless testing because those sites will allow Google to use its own employees for the experiments and more effectively manage the tests, Entner believes. Google, said Levin, has been the "single most important force" in improving Internet speed, access and price for Americans. ©2016 the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.) Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.

A new Federal Communications Commission (FCC) filing from the company hints that they are intending to expand the testing of their wireless broadband technology in 24 U.S. locations, which includes 12 cities, for a period of two years. All of the selected locations are already covered by Google's super-fast gigabit internet fiber service except Provo in Utah, Boulder in Colorado, and Reston in Virginia. These test locations were reportedly chosen for the presence of pre-existing Google infrastructure, building and foliage characteristics for interference testing, radio transmission environment, and the existence of partners who may participate in tests. A probable part of these expanded testings are technologies and areas acquired from Google's recent purchase of Webpass, a company that was already providing wireless internet to homes using millimeter wave radio transmitters. The consolidation of Google's own in-house fiber and wireless broadband technology and the acquired Webpass assets will surely hasten the roll-out of this planned expansion. The new technology is already being tested in Kansas City using experimental 3.5 Ghz wireless transmitters but with the new filing, Google is asking for permission to transmit over a wider bandwidth, between 3.4 and 3.8 GHz, to beam their service to the planned locations. According to Slashgear, the proposed locations are as follows: • Phoenix, Arizona • Atwater, California • Los Angeles, California • Mountain View, California • Palo Alto, California • San Bruno, California • San Francisco, California • San Jose, California • Boulder, Colorado • Tampa, Florida • Atlanta, Georgia • Chicago, Illinois • Des Moines, Iowa • Kansas City, Kansas • Omaha, Nebraska • Las Vegas, Nevada • New York, New York • Raleigh, North Carolina • Oklahoma City, Oklahoma • Portland, Oregon • Austin, Texas • Provo, Utah • Blacksburg, Virginia • Reston, Virginia Unfortunately, Google's wireless fiber will not be open to the public yet. Currently, only Google employees, contractors and selected "trusted testers" will have the privilege of trying this exciting new service out. For the rest of us, hopefully, it will not be a long two-year wait. Please share this information with everyone.

DY plunged almost 10% in yesterday’s trading session, reportedly on rumors that Alphabet’s GOOGL Google unit is curtailing its roll-out of fiber-optic broadband lines to homes in the United States. Over the past few days, media reports that Google (which is rumored to be a major client of Dycom) is pulling back from fiber-based broadband in favor of a wireless solution, have been doing rounds. Per these reports, Google has put its plans to deliver fiber-based high-speed Internet in the cities of San Jose, Mountain View and Palo Alto on hold, and is instead looking to use wireless solution to install broadband. The reports insist that Google is favoring aerial installation. In fact, Business Insider discovered a Google filing with the FCC asking for permission to expand tests of its wireless broadband technology to several U.S. cities (including the three Silicon Valley locations named above). It seems that some investors believe the news to be a sign of future demand. In fact, shares of Dycom have been on a sharp downtrend since last Friday. DYCOM INDS Price and Consensus DYCOM INDS Price and Consensus | DYCOM INDS Quote However, the fact remains that even if the rumors are true and Google is actually a big client of Dycom’s, the latter has much bigger clients who remain committed to their fiber outlay. Dycom has a highly concentrated client base, among which the biggest ones, i.e. AT&T, Inc. T, Comcast Corporation CMCSA, Verizon and Centurylink contributed about 56% of revenues in fiscal 2015. Based in North Palm Beach, FL, Dycom provides specialty contracting services in the U.S. and Canada. The company offers engineering services like underground and buried fiber-optic design. According to the company, network operators are increasingly deploying fiber optic cable technology deeper into their networks and closer to consumers and businesses. Dycom is well positioned to reap significant benefits from the accelerating fiber spending environment. The company is particularly benefiting from extensive deployment of 1-Gigabyte wireline networks by major industry participants. Surging demand for 1-Gigabyte deployments from several large customers, huge investments in wireline networks, cable capacity projects and the ongoing Connect America Fund II project will likely drive significant expansion in Dycom’s market share. We believe that Dycom’s business stands to benefit greatly from proliferating demand for network bandwidth and mobile broadband and other positive industry trends. Dycom presently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Spotted in the Git repository, developers at Google are working on a new operating system dubbed Fuchsia OS, and it may be meant for mobile phones, computers, and other devices. It likely doesn’t have much to do with the rumored merger between Android and Chrome OS, the system that runs Google’s Chromebooks. Related: Google adds a Dashboard to Google Now, but only for the rumored Nexus Launcher This is likely something completely new — the description in the repository says “Pick + Purple == Fuchsia (a new Operating System), and those colors do not represent either Android or Chrome OS. According to Hacker News, Travis Geiselbrech, who worked on NewOS, BeOS, Danger, Palm’s webOS and iOS, and Brian Swetland, who also worked on BeOS and Android, are involved in this project. The new, mysterious operating system will be powered by the Magenta and LK kernel. “LK is a kernel designed for small systems typically used in embedded applications.” reads the repository. “On the other hand, Magenta targets modern phones and modern personal computers with fast processors, non-trivial amounts of RAM with arbitrary peripherals doing open-ended computation.” There’s a lot of discussion going around about what exactly all of this could mean for the new operating system, and whether or not this is indeed meant for an Android and Chrome OS merger, or for something new. Google tells Digital Trends it has nothing to comment about at this time. Chances are we won’t find out anything new for a while, since Fuchsia OS is early in development. We’ll update this post as we learn more about it.

As in, not just an upgrade to Android or Chrome OS, but instead, a new system that’s not derived from the Linux kernel. It’s called Fuchsia. While Google hasn’t officially announced anything about the OS, it released details about the project on GitHub with the cryptic description “Pink + Purple == Fuchsia (a new Operating System).” TNW Answers Your questions answered by founders, experts and thought leaders in business, design and tech. Join a chat Android Police dove deeper into the documentation and found some interesting tidbits. First off, the OS uses a new Magenta kernel, which is designed to compete with IoT-oriented operating systems like FreeRTOS or ThreadX. The difference here is that Magenta appears designed to scale all the way up to smartphones and desktop computers. Meanwhile, Dart is the main programming language and Flutter support indicates that the OS will likely use Material Design for its user interface. That doesn’t necessarily indicate Google has plans for Fuchsia beyond IoT devices; with the company creating more IoT hardware like OnHub and Google Home, it might simply want a lighter OS that can work for any future hardware products. Still, the ability to scale up remains exciting, especially as the line between Android and ChromeOS becomes increasingly blurred. As for why Google has remained so quiet about the OS so far: Brian Swetland – a senior Engineer at Google who has worked on Android and the T-mobile Sidekick’s OS – mentions that the decision was made to build the OS open source from the beginning, implying that some details are yet to be finalized. Eventually things will be made public, documented and announced, says Christopher Lane, another engineer at Google. Until then, we can only speculate.

The company apparently gave a glance to fans of an unreleased Nexus phone. On its Instagram account, Google posted a video to promote the Google Photos app for iOS and Android, where it is displayed a phone that is not familiar among Google’s free devices. It could be undoubtedly a prototype looking similar to an iPhone SE, which has been set up to run Google’s current new Android 7.0 Nougat software. Leaked renders have depicted Google’s new Nexus devices ahead of their official launch. Image Credit: BGR Google has previously revealed Nexus devices throughout marketing videos, and it is possible the company did it again with the first official render of a new 2016 Nexus phone. The company had planned for the phone’s render to be revealed later this year, yet Google jumped forward ahead of scheduled. Consumers are always looking fresh options to change their phones, and it seems like Androids have captured the attention of them. When asked, consumers also referred to Android phones as innovative, affordable and compatibles with new Android software updates. Google’s Nexus lineup has become the favorite among users, in fact, for some of them, the Nexus 6P is the best Android phone ever. Apart from its bodily characteristics, the Nexus 6P features an advanced technology security which is quicker and offers more security with the fingerprint sensor placed behind the back of the device. After the success of the Nexus 6P, the giant searcher is aiming to present a phone to be the successor of Nexus 6P: the Marlin. Marlin & Sailfish The company has also announced the launch of two phones called Marlin and Sailfish during 2016. On one hand, the Marlin is expected to be the successor to the popular Nexus 6P, whose hardware has been developed in an all-metal design and cutting-edge specs. It has been rumored that the Sailfish, on the other hand, is expected to be a smaller phone compared with the Marlin, in a plastic design, but with similar specs features.

Google’s Android 7.0 Nougat software Alongside with new Android devices, Google has also announced some updates to its software. During the release in March, the company stated the new software would be available later this summer. By then, the company only said that most of the changes would not be visual but internal. After the global release, people have used beta versions to test the Android 7.0 Nougat software and it seems it runs smoothly on Nexus devices. The new Android’s software will be free software, update for all smartphones and tablets that can support it. Manufacturers like Samsung, Motorola, LG, among others, could get likewise updates of the software. Considering that the Android 6.0 Marshmallow could not immediately be updated in most of Android’s devices, it is expected that the software rolls out much faster for everybody.

SEOUL,KOREA 12 August 2016 - 10:30am Cho Jin-young The Fair Trade Commission (FTC) of South Korea came to a conclusion that Google Korea’s preloaded apps and subsidies for search ads do not constitute any abuse of market dominance. This is because Naver enjoyed a market share of more than 70%, Daum Kakao enjoyed a market share of 15% to 19% and that of Google was merely 2% to 8% during the period of 2008 to March this year, when Google was involved in preloading of apps in the South Korean market. The FTC also made a decision contrary to that of the EU with regard to Google’s search ad subsidies provided for mobile carriers. According to the FTC, the amount of the subsidies was very small in correlation with the company’s market share and, as such, the subsidies did not restrict competition in the market. The commission is planning to keep monitoring the possibility of Google Korea’s market dominance abuse, but restrictions are rather unlikely with its preloaded apps acquitted. Google’s Android OS supply contracts with smartphone manufacturers such as Samsung Electronics stipulate that Google’s Android applications cannot be loaded in the case of downloading of a mutant application. This means Samsung Electronics has to accept unremovable preloaded apps on its Android smartphones. This is for Google to increase its profits based on paid app sale and search ads by making consumers familiar with those apps. Google explained that the apps are to prevent the inconvenience of consumers that could arise when the mutant application is incompatible, but this act was criticized as being contradictory to its own open platform policy. A large number of people are still claiming that such preloaded apps negatively affect the domestic app ecosystem as South Korean app developers are driven to resort to games, SNS and the like due to the dominant market share of Google in the segments including video streaming, map information, etc.  Categories:  News ICT View the discussion thread.

Published in News South Korea investigates Google by Nick Farrell on12 August 2016 Tweet font size decrease font size increase font size Print Email Playing monopoly South Korea's antitrust regulator has admitted for the first time that it is looking into whether Google has violated the country's anticompetition laws. The Korea Fair Trade Commission (KFTC) disclosed the investigation in a brief statement. It did not say what the probe was about nor any potential antitrust violations. The KFTC apparently raided Google's Seoul headquarters in July. The antitrust body's statement came after a local media report said the KFTC had decided to clear Google of anticompetition charges involving the pre-loading of the company's apps on smartphones running on the Android operating system. So it probably wants to make it clear that no thumbs have been raised for the search engine yet. While it wasn't clear whether the probe would lead to any formal charges, the investigation is another regulatory headache for Google. The firm was fined $6.8 million in Russia on Thursday and faces multiple European Union antitrust charges. The KFTC has investigated Google before. In 2013, the regulator cleared Google of wrongdoing following a probe into whether the company hurt competition by forcing smartphone makers using Android to pre-load its search engine on the handsets.

 South Korea says investigating whether Google broke antitrust laws Reuters Aug. 11, 2016, 10:02 PM 100 facebook linkedin twitter email print File photo of a woman holding her smart phone which displays the Google home page, in this picture illustration Thomson Reuters SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's antitrust regulator said on Friday it is looking into whether Google has violated the country's anticompetition laws, marking the body's first acknowledgement of a formal scrutiny against the global internet search company. The Korea Fair Trade Commission (KFTC) did not comment on the nature of its investigation of Google in its statement, and didn't disclose which potential violations it's investigating. Google, whose corporate parent is Alphabet Inc , declined to comment. The antitrust body's statement was in response to a local media report that said the KFTC decided to clear Google of anticompetition charges involving the pre-loading of the company's apps on smartphones running on the Android operating system.

Apps/Games News Pokémon Go Problems And Their Solutions: Update Erased Progress, Server Problem, GPS, Lags, Spinning Ball By Pranav Rastogi - August 12, 2016 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter tweet Pokémon Go has taken the world by storm, and people are displaying an unprecedented zeal for the game. However, with a player base this large, a lot of problems have crept up too. Today, we take a look at six most common Pokémon Go problems, and their quick solutions! Update erased the progress? If the latest update to Pokémon Go has completely wiped away your progress, then fret not: you are not alone, and there is a simple solution to the problem. The game’s creator recently noted the issue and made it clear that your progress hasn’t simply vanished. The bug is mostly present on iOS, and appeared in the first place because the new version of Pokémon Go links the security check to the Google account you have logged into using Safari. To restore the progress in the game, log out of your account in the app, and then go on to log out of your Google account in Safari. If you’re not successful the first time, you might have to repeat the steps a few times. Now, log in into your Google account and the app again, and in that order. The problem will be solved. Server Problems Everyone who plays Pokémon Go knows how much problem the servers can be at times — they have gone down on multiple occasions after the launching of the game. Moreover, down time has increased since the game was launched in new countries. Unfortunately, as players, there is nothing you can do about this. It is the developer’s — in this case, Niantic’s — responsibility to prevent frequent server meltdown. Furthermore, if you do want to check if the server is down at the current moment or not, you can head over to this site: Pokémon Go Server Status Game won’t launch on the phone Make sure you have the right phone and the latest operating system running. iPhone users must have an iPhone 5 or later model, and the iPhone must be running iOS 8 or later version. Android users need a phone with at least 1280 x 720 resolution and running Android 4.4 KitKat or later. Do note that Pokémon Go has a drastic impact on battery, and that means you are going to need an external power pack for long Pokémon hunting trips. Game cannot find GPS Signal Every once in a while, you will experience the ‘GPS signal not found’ box on your screen — and that can be pretty frustrating. The fixes you should give a shot are simple. iOS users can head to Settings > Privacy > Location Services. Turn the Location Services on by tapping on the switch. Android users can swipe using two fingers from the top to bring the quick settings menu, and see if the ‘Location’ is grayed out: if it is, tap on it to turn the location on. Make sure that the WiFi is turned on, even if you’re using the mobile data to hunt Pokémon. It helps with providing an accurate location. If nothing from the above options works, you can try quitting the app and rebooting the phone. Eternal Spinning Ball You might have noticed a spinning Pokéball in the top right corner of the screen. This icon indicates that the game is connecting or communicating with the server. However, sometimes it just stays there, spinning, instead of disappearing like it’s supposed to. This, of course, points to some server issue that you, as a user, can do nothing about — it is Niantic’s responsibility, and we hope they get on top of this as soon as possible. Users have noticed that the issue usually occurring right after they have caught a new Pokémon. If you do face a similar issue, try quitting the game altogether. Rest assured, your Pokémon will be there when you reopen it. Choppy/Laggy game If you open Pokémon Go and find that the game is basically unplayable, because it is really choppy and there are a lot of dropped frames, it might be time to update the game itself. Head over to the App Store, or Play Store, and update the app to the latest version. If you find that no update is available, it is much more likely that the choppiness is because of server issues, and as mentioned a lot of times before, there is nothing you can do about it.

The US women’s basketball team came back from a slow start to hand a 30 point loss to previously unbeaten Canada.

So far, there’s an argument to be made that the women’s team is looking more dominant than the men’s side of thing (although that Australia game might be somewhat distorted). Next up for Team USA: China. That could very well end up looking about as one-sided as today’s game. That will wrap up our coverage of women’s basketball but stay tuned here at the Guardian for literally non-stop Olympics coverage. Thanks to everybody who followed along with our coverage of USA/Canada. Ciao! Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 4.12pm EDT 16:12 The US started off sluggish, but took over in the second, beating a very good Canadian team by 30 points. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 4.11pm EDT 16:11 US wins! Canada 51-81 US, FINAL Stewart gets to the line, misses her first free throw but hits her second. Shona Thorburn makes a layup for Canada and adds a free throw to the total. Stewart hits a jump shot to make it an even 30 point victory for the US. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 4.08pm EDT 16:08 Canada 48-78 US, 1:38, 4th quarter Tamika Catchings picks up her first points of the game. It’s officially one of those games where Geno’s giving a chance for everybody to score And hey, Ayim makes her second straight three-pointer. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 4.06pm EDT 16:06 Canada 45-76 US, 2:39, 4th quarter Miranda Ayim makes a three-pointer for Canada, but it’s getting far too late for my “only lose by single digits” prediction to come through. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 4.04pm EDT 16:04 Canada 42-76 US, 3:15, 4th quarter Delle Donne with a three-pointer. Breanna Stewart, can you imagine that this team is so good that they can just keep Stewart buried on the bench, is in and scores on a nifty alley oop ably assisted by Sue Bird. Updated at 5.01pm EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 4.01pm EDT 16:01 Canada 42-71 US, 4:30, 4th quarter Seimone Augustus is in the game now and, as seems to happen every time the US bring in someone off the bench, she scores immediately. Twice, in this case with two straight jumpers. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 3.59pm EDT 15:59 Canada 42-67 US, 6:30, 4th quarter Moore pulls down a rebound. Fowles completes an old fashioned three point play. Canada takes a timeout, although there’s not really anything they could draw up here at this point of the game. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 3.56pm EDT 15:56 Canada 42-64 US, 7:28 4th quarter McCoughtry adds to the US lead. Plouffe gets to the line, making both free throws. Raincock-Ekunwe, who’s been mostly quiet since the first quarter, makes a jumpshot. Feels like the US defensive effort has slipped slightly, but it’s hard to blame them. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 3.53pm EDT 15:53 Canada 38-62 US, 9:18, 4th quarter Delle Donne scores first in the fourth as well. Katherine Plouffe responds with a jumper immediately. Updated at 3.53pm EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 3.51pm EDT 15:51 Canada 36-60 US, end of the 3rd quarter Delle Donne with a layup and that will do us for scoring in the third quarter. The rest of this might just be garbage time. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 3.50pm EDT 15:50 Canada 36-58 US, 1:47, 3rd quarter Elena Delle Donne hits two free throws. Tatham makes a layup for Canada. Maybe the smoothest stretch of basketball we’ve seen all game. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 3.46pm EDT 15:46 Canada 34-54 US, 2:45, 3rd quarter Not that Canada isn’t still trying. Nurse hits a basket, that is immediately answered by McCoughtry with a layup. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 3.45pm EDT 15:45 Canada 32-52 US, 3:00, 3rd quarter Sylvia Fowles gets into the game for the first time and immediately gets Fowled. (I bet she’s heard this pun three million times). She makes a free throw. Then McCoughtry makes a basket to give the US a 20-point lead and that might end Canada’s chances. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 3.42pm EDT 15:42 Canada 32-49 US, 3:29, 3rd quarter Tina Charles is back on the line, where she’s been doing some damage, she knocks down both. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 3.40pm EDT 15:40 Canada 32-47 US, 3:53, 3rd quarter Achonwa with a basket and a three-point chance… but she misses the free throw. Taurasi sits with three fouls. But Fields gets the new-fangled three-pointer and Canada has life. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 3.38pm EDT 15:38 Canada 27-47 US, 5:01, 3rd quarter Griner with a jumpshot. Yeah, the US are in “we got this” mode. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 3.37pm EDT 15:37 Canada 27-45 US, 5:29, 3rd quarter Taurasi makes her fourth three of the game!

Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 3.35pm EDT 15:35 Canada 27-42 US, 7:05, 3rd quarter Tamara Tatham with a three pointer… which is immediately answered by Taurasi for the US. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 3.34pm EDT 15:34 Canada 24-39 US, 8:02, 3rd quarter Kim Gaucher gets the first second half basket for Canada.

Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 3.32pm EDT 15:32 Canada 22-37 US, 8:34, 3rd quarter Griner with a block. Then she gets to the line, making one of two free throws. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 3.31pm EDT 15:31 Canada 22-36 US, 9:28, 3rd quarter And the US has possession to start the half, but Taurasi immediately gets called for a foul. But Canada gets called for a foul on their end too. Oh man, now we’re getting commentators. I was getting used to the almost zen-like silence. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 3.24pm EDT 15:24 Oh so that’s how US/Sweden ended. Ouch. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 3.21pm EDT 15:21 Beyond Maya Moore, who has 12 points, Canada’s defense has been quite good this game, it’s just their offense is struggling. There’s a lot of unforced turnovers on their side and the US aren’t going to let you get away with those. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 3.18pm EDT 15:18 Halftime! Canada 22-36 US, end of the 1st half Or not. Fields with a layup for Canada AND she’s fouled and gets the “and one.” Canada is looking for momentum headed into the break, but instead they get on the receiving end of a Taurasi three-pointer. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 3.14pm EDT 15:14 Canada 19-33 US, :27, 2nd quarter Diana Taurasi with a three pointer and it looks like the US is starting to pull away here. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 3.12pm EDT 15:12 Canada 19-30 US, 1:27, 2nd quarter Canada lets the ball go out of bounds and it’s US ball again. The US don’t come up with anything, but Canada loses control for the second straight possession, Maya Moore goes on a fast break and lays it in. Wow. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 3.09pm EDT 15:09 Canada 19-28 US, 3:33, 2nd quarter Timeout here. We get shots of both coaches giving out instructions. No swearing this time around. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 3.07pm EDT 15:07 Canada 19-28 US, 3:47, 2nd quarter Getting to the line seems to be the only way Canada can score at the moment. Natalie Achonwa makes it to the line and finally a player hits both of their free throws. Canada’s joy is short lived as Maya Moore gets a clean look at the basket and nails it in. A defensive breakdown that. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 3.05pm EDT 15:05 Canada 17-26 US, 4:48, 2nd quarter A bit more back-and-forth here, both teams are committing too many turnovers. The US seems to know what to do when they get them though, Maya Moore makes a jumper. Canada’s in a severe scoring drought here. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 3.02pm EDT 15:02 Canada 17-24 US, 5:55, 2nd quarter And Angel McCoughtry gets a basket. Canada still too f’ing passive maybe? Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 3.01pm EDT 15:01 Canada 17-22 US, 7:23, 2nd quarter A field goal! Maya Moore with the layup. And a layup from Whalen. Here come the USA chants. Canada takes a timeout and, amusing, the head coach is miked up and caught saying “We’re playing too fucking passive.” Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 2.57pm EDT 14:57 Canada 17-18 US, 8:12, 2nd quarter And the US turns the ball over once again but Canada again cannot convert. This is… this is not good basketball. Maybe they should have stayed on soccer. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 2.56pm EDT 14:56 Canada 17-18 US, 9:25, 2nd quarter This has not been a free throw clinic. Nissa Fields hits only one of two free throws, cutting the US lead to 1. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 2.54pm EDT 14:54 Canada 16-18 US, end of the 1st quarter Lindsay Whalen fouls Rainock-Ekunwe, who misses both free throws. Tina Charles gets to the line for the US, and misses HER two free throws. Not been the smoothest of games so far. Katherine Plouffe knocks down a shot to bring Canada to just a point behind, but Whalen hits a jumper to increase the US lead. Canada get one more free throw from Kia Nurse to end the first quarter. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 2.48pm EDT 14:48 Canada 13-16 US, 1:47, 1st quarter Canada turns the ball over, but the US can’t score. The sporadic defense chants maybe helped. The Pynchonian named Nayo Rainock-Ekunwe hits a jump shot for Canada. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 2.45pm EDT 14:45 Canada 11-16 US, 3:11, 1st quarter It’s kind of calming to watch this action without any announcers or television stuff plastered everywhere. Tina Charles gets to the line, knocks down two more free throws. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 2.43pm EDT 14:43 Canada 11-14 US, 4:15, 1st quarter And Maya Moore gets fouled and goes to the line, hitting both of her free throws to increase the US lead. She’s a lot more cool and collected than I have been over the last 10 minutes. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 2.41pm EDT 14:41 Canada 11-12 US, 4:55, 1st quarter NOW the stream is fixed, just in time for the US to take a lead. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 2.37pm EDT 14:37 Opening tip Canada 7-6 US, 7:34, 1st quarter The game has started, but the NBC Olympics site’s basketball livestream is still on the ongoing football game. Forcing me to try to find an alternate broadcast. My apologies for this, but at least I have the score here. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 2.29pm EDT 14:29 *clicks on basketball livestream, gets soccer coverage* Okay I know this game’s being overshadowed at a moment, but that’s just rude. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 2.20pm EDT 14:20 An underrated reason why basketball is the best sport at the Summer Olympics: win or lose at least there’s never a threat of being decided by penalty kicks. I may be throwing shade here. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 2.14pm EDT 14:14 Predictions With that being said, are the women’s team just gong to barrel through this tournament untouched? It’s the most likely outcome, but it’s not guaranteed. Heck, the men’s team just showed their vulnerability in their game against Australia, so anything’s possible. I don’t think Canada will beat the US, but I believe they will keep it close. I’m going to go out on a limb and say that the US’s margin of victory will be in single-digits. Your thoughts? We’ll include your predictions here if you wish to go on record, just email them to Hunter.Felt@theguardian.com or tweet them to @HunterFelt. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 2.10pm EDT 14:10 On Geno Auriemma’s comments While his comments are a bit self-serving, he’s defending his UConn program as much as he is his national team, it is strange that the women’s team is getting the same level of criticism as the men’s team. Yes, both teams have traditionally been much more talented than their opponents, and they do come from professional teams, but the WNBA is hardly equivalent to the NBA in terms of money and exposure. Heck, many WNBA players have to play in overseas clubs to actually earn a decent wage. While for the men’s team the Olympics tends to be a fun side thing, this is the biggest stage female basketball players will ever have. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 1.59pm EDT 13:59 Earlier Serbia defeated China 80-72 this afternoon, giving them their first women’s basketball win in the Olympics. They still have to beat Senegal on Sunday to have a shot at advancing from pool play. China, meanwhile, will be playing the US.

The US opened the tournament with a historic 121-56 win over Senegal, a 103-63 defeat of Spain and a 110-85 win over Serbia on Wednesday. Canada, meanwhile, beat China 90-68, Serbia 71-67 and Senegal 68-58. Obviously, the point spread isn’t quite as impressive, but they’re still obviously a talent team and certainly the biggest challenge the US women’s team have faced so far. Their lineup features Nirra Fields from the Phoenix Mercury, Natalie Achonwa of the Indiana Fever and Kia Nurse from the Connecticut Huskies, who are technically a NCAA team but might as well be a pro team. It would not be surprising at all if Canada were to put the US women’s team under the same amount of pressure that Australia put on the men’s team on Wednesday. Maybe that’s just me hoping that I don’t get stuck liveblogging all the blowouts. (Yes, this probably isn’t very patriotic of me.) If you want to join in during today’s liveblog, you can just send your questions, commentary and predictions to us and we’ll use them over the course of the next few hours. Send them via email, to Hunter.Felt@theguardian.com or tweet them to @HunterFelt. So, it’s the USA vs Canada in the women’s basketball competition, we’re set to start off here around 2:30pm EST, but I will be back far sooner or that with lineups, predictions and other miscellaneous US basketball/Olympics talk. (In the meantime you may want to keep track of what’s going on with the US women’s football team, if you’re not already.) Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 10.13am EDT 10:13 Hunter will be here shortly. In the meantime, here’s Geno Auriemma on our “Trumpian era”: Auriemma said: “We live in that Trumpian era where it’s OK to be sexist and degrade people that are good, just because they’re the opposite sex. “We are what we are,” he said. “We’re never going to apologize for being that good. We’re never going to apologize for setting a standard that other people aspire to achieve. We got a guy in the pool with a USA swim cap on who nobody can beat. And if he wasn’t in swimming, there would be a lot of other guys with gold medals. He said of his team: “These are Olympians. They’re supposed to play at a high level. They’re professionals, they’re supposed to put on a show, they’re supposed to entertain. So, what are we supposed to do? Just go out there and win by a little? We’re not bad for women’s basketball, just like I say at UConn, we’re not bad for women’s basketball. What’s bad for women’s basketball is when nobody’s great, because then you could say, “You know what? I don’t think anybody really knows how to play this game.” US women's basketball coach: 'We're in a Trumpian era where it's OK to be sexist' Read more Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close Topics USA women's basketball team Rio 2016 Olympic Games US sports Basketball Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Close Reuse this content View all comments > Order by newest oldest recommendations Show 25 25 50 100 All Threads collapsed expanded unthreaded Loading comments… Trouble loading?

The result has been prying Google+ from some of its most used services such as YouTube and now the Play Store. If you’ve ever gotten an app or media from Google’s Play Store you’ll notice that you needed to be signed into your Google account to do anything and you would be able to rate and review apps with Google+. When installing apps, some of the more social ones that share progress—like gaming apps—ask for specific details to share with Google+ and can be tedious if you prefer going through all of the social stuff and marking stuff private. So, without Google+ users will be able to review and rate via their main account. Now that Google+ isn’t tied to another of the company’s services it will be interesting to see what Google does with Plus—if the company tries to salvage it, allows it to sink, or simply discontinues it. Of course any step taken with Google+ would probably be gradual as Google+ does have a user base.

Washington:  Imagine a Google-Glass type 'smart' eyewear that can integrate augmented reality with your own and feed you live information about your surroundings. A new portable system developed by researchers may make this possible. Wearable displays also have the potential to enhance cognitive ergonomics, or more simply, make it less mentally taxing to complete certain tasks, researchers said. But before technologies like Google Glass become a part of daily life, engineers need a way to monitor exactly how they affect the brain in everyday situations, they said. Researchers from Drexel University in the US developed a portable system that can do just that. The system uses functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to measure a person's brain activity. The system can integrate augmented reality with your own, feed you live information about your surroundings and even be used in the operating room, researchers said. The applications for fNIRS are seemingly endless - from training air traffic controllers and drone operators, to studying how students with disabilities learn best, they said. "This is a new trend called neuroergonomics. It is the study of the brain at work - cognitive neuroscience plus human factors," said Hasan Ayaz from Drexel University. Until now, most studies involving fNIRS took place indoors. Though participants wearing the system could move around freely while being monitored, they were still observed within laboratory confines. Now, researchers have brought their portable fNIRS system "into the wild." They successfully measured the brain activity of participants navigating a college campus outdoors. Researchers wanted to compare one group of participants navigating the campus with Google Glass to another group using Google Maps on a smartphone. Their goal was to measure mental workload (how hard the brain is working) and situation awareness (the perception of environmental elements), in order to see which device was less mentally taxing. They found that overall, users using Google Glass had a higher situation awareness and lower mental workload than their peers navigating with a smartphone. However, researchers also found that users wearing Google Glass fell victim to "cognitive tunneling," meaning they focused so much more of their attention to the display itself, that they easily ignored other aspects of their surroundings. "What we were able to see were the strengths and weaknesses of both. Now that we know we are able to capture that, we can now improve their design," said Mr Ayaz. "This opens up all new areas of applications. We will be able to analyse how the brain is functioning during all of these natural activities that you cannot replicate in artificial lab settings," he said. The findings were published in the journal Frontiers in Human Neuroscience.

Do you have a Google+ account? You might not even know. If you have one, do you ever actually use it? You might not care much about the social network, but you definitely had to at least have a Google+ account if you wanted to talk about your experiences with a particular app on the Google Play store. That's right. Google's policy, up until now, has been that only those with connected Google+ accounts can post app reviews on Google Play. Google has since changed its mind and is starting to eliminate this requirement, but its move comes fairly quietly. A few users recently mentioned the change to Android Police, and TechCrunch has since confirmed with a Google spokesperson that a Google+ account is no longer needed to post reviews. //Related Articles Beta Testers 'Explore Interests' in Google Now Google appears to be rolling out the change across accounts, as some users have reported being able to post reviews on Google Play without needing a Google+ account, whereas others seem to still be stuck with the requirement. It's unclear just how long it might take Google to lift the restriction for everyone, but we figure it shouldn't take too long. As part of the removal, Google has also nixed the "+1" voting that you could do for an app, which then indicated to your other Google+ friends that they should potentially check out whatever it is you liked. Users could also access a "people" section on the store that showed them all the different apps their Google+ friends recommendedfor those of you with a ton of connections on Google's arguably failed social networking site. Google's changes shouldn't be that surprising, given that the company has been slowly distancing its major applications and services away from Google+. Google decoupled Google+ from YouTube in July of last year, and the company announced it was removing the Google+ requirement for Google Play Games in January. Instead, Android gamers were given new "Gamer IDs" to use when signing in, which they could link to a normal Gmail account instead of a Google+ account.

An anonymous reader writes: The Google Play Store is the latest Google product to drop integration with Google+. The Play Store has dropped Google+ votes from apps and nixed the Google+ account requirement from app reviews, reports Ars Technica. "There was an entire Google+ focused 'People' section on the Play Store that showed apps and ratings from people you follow on Google+. The Play Store also allowed users to '+1' apps on the Play Store, which served as a vote of approval from people you follow. Both features are being stripped out of Google Play, starting earlier this week. The other feature being removed is the requirement to have a Google+ account to leave a Play Store review on apps, games, and media. Several users have reported to Android Police that they can now leave reviews using their regular Google account, where before they were nagged to create a Google+ account." google internet news ← You may like to read: → Microsoft Starts Testing Windows 10's Next Major Update Donald Trump Wins US Presidency VC, Entrepreneur Says Basic Income Would Work Even If 90% People 'Smoked Pot' and Didn't Work Yelp Employee Posts Open Letter About Cost Of Living And Low Wages, Gets Fired Universal Basic Income Programs Arrive Russia Unveils 'Satan 2' Missile Powerful Enough To 'Wipe Out UK, France Or Texas' Submission: Google Play Store Drops Google+ Integration No Man's Sky Launches On Steam and GOG and It's Off To A Rocky Start This discussion has been archived.

SUBSCRIBE Google lets any publisher apply to have “Critic Reviews” of local businesses Launched with five approved publishers, Google opens the doors to anyone to apply -- even Yelp and TripAdvisor. Danny Sullivan on August 12, 2016 at 3:15 pm More Want to have your “critic review” of a local business perhaps appear in relation to it within Google search? Today, Google’s announced that any publisher can apply to participate. Last year, Google launched the “Critic Reviews” feature for movies, TV shows and books. Last week, Google announced it was now available for local businesses, such as restaurants. How the “Critic Reviews” feature looks For example, a search for the San Francisco restaurant Gary Danko brings up a “Critic reviews” section within the Knowledge Graph panel for the restaurant on desktop: On mobile devices — which is how most people search on Google these days — the section gets much more prominent placement Who gets to be listed in Critic Reviews? When Google announced the feature for local businesses last week, it listed a few partners, but not all of them. Notably absent as partners were Yelp and TripAdvisor, which accurately complained earlier this week that the new feature caused their listings in Google on mobile search to be pushed farther to the bottom. They inaccurately suggested that Google was only showing its own Zagat content. Since we reported those complaints, I’ve had daily emails with Google to understand who exactly is listed in Critic Reviews and how those work. Those initial partners were: 10best.com Travel & Leisure Michelin UrbanDaddy Zagat Until now, only content from those initial partners would be displayed in the Critics Review section. I was also told that one reason review sites like Yelp or TripAdvisor wouldn’t be included was that the feature was designed to spotlight critics from publishers, rather than users or customers at large. In other words, while Yelp and TripAdvisor have excellent content about local businesses, they don’t actually have their own reviewers who write from a publication perspective, as a newspaper or magazine might. That seemingly disqualified them from appearing in this new section for local businesses. But in further exploring things for a story (that’s still to come), I raised some issues with Google yesterday about how much the existing partners really spoke with a publisher review “voice.” For instance, in the Gary Danko example above, this is the Google-owned Zagat review: That “review” is simply a compilation of user comments that Zagat has assembled. So how is that really a publisher review? Google told me: A Zagat editor curates a Zagat review. And while the quotations are from users, a Zagat editor synthesizes these user reviews with an editorial tone of voice which represents the spirit and ambiance of a given place. How to be listed in Critic Reviews What wasn’t clear in those email discussions I had with Google is that apparently, it was allowing any publisher to apply for inclusion — even Yelp and TripAdvisor, if they wanted. Part of this might have been due to confusion in a discussion of a related “On These Lists” feature that also went live. Google told me instructions on how to apply were posted in a section for developers on August 5, the same day the new Critic Reviews feature went live. So even before the complaints — and not in response to them, Google stressed to me — other publishers could apply. It’s just that no one likely knew this until the blog post that Google made today. To recap, any publisher that wants to be eligible to appear in the Critics Reviews section can request inclusion, assuming they’ve done the proper markup. Notably, there’s no requirement to have some type of editorial voice or publisher-employed critic requirement, that I can see. The markup instructions are here. It effectively means that behind the scenes, publishers tag their pages in a way to indicate to Google that they have a review of a local business. Assuming the markup is in place, publishers then must apply to be included. If accepted, then their reviews will be eligible to appear, assuming the Google algorithm finds them relevant. For local search, Yelp & TripAdvisor ought to be included The good news for Yelp and TripAdvisor is if they go through the process above, they — like any other publisher — have a shot at showing up in the new section. The bad news is that neither company was invited to participate from the start. Given both have been critical against Google with past and on-going anti-trust actions, I can understand why Google might not want to involve them. But the bottom line is that they have excellent local information, and as a search engine, Google’s job is to show such information to its users. I’ll be returning to this more in a future article. But rather than this “Critic Review” section, I’d far rather see a section called “Local reviews” that gave prominent placement to Yelp and TripAdvisor along with Google Maps, so that you could click and go directly to the review sites. I think that information would be far more helpful to the local searcher trying to understand if a business is good. That’s also part of what Yelp would like to see, from an interview I had with them earlier this week. I can’t say for TripAdvisor, because it never responded to my email. And again, I’ll explore this issue more in a future article. NOTE: This article was revised to note that Google said the application process opened at the same time the new feature launched and requested to drop the “After complaints” part from the headline.

As a group, they appear to want to defund public schools and provide taxpayer funding of private, parochial and religious schools that are largely unregulated and would provide religious indoctrination of students. They want to provide taxpayer subsidy of unregulated, for-profit charter schools that have largely failed to provide better education than our public schools. They want our schools to teach pseudoscience nonsense. They want no national standards or standardized testing for education. Even the most educated one of the bunch, Dr. Ben Carson, appears to be completely ignorant when it comes to the critical issues regarding education of our children. How can the United States expect to be competitive in a world where everyone else does a far better job of providing an educated citizenry? David Lewis Mountain View Mount Um Radar Tower is not unsafe Midpeninsula Regional Open Space District General Manager Steve Abbors (Opinion, Aug. 5) called the Mount Umunhum Radar Tower an unsafe structure. This is a misleading statement. Hazardous materials were remediated in 2010 and in 2011. Midpen commissioned a tower structural analysis report that concluded, “the building, even in its damaged state, has sufficient capacity to resist over 100 percent of the California Building Code Chapter 16 demands.” That “damage” (from the 1989 Loma Prieta quake) is being only partially repaired by Midpen, which is putting the onus on the Umunhum Conservancy donations for the remainder. When all repairs are completed, the result (quoting again from the structural analysis) will “provide a gain of 137 percent vs. the damaged building and 48 percent vs. the original building.” The aforementioned structural analysis report was never posted to Midpen’s website but was obtained via a Freedom of Information Act request. Basim Jaber Historian Almaden Air Force Station San Jose Sen. Pan is right regarding vaccinations Matt Rode (Letters, Aug. 9) wrote what I have been thinking since the story this past week regarding the recall of Sen. Richard Pan, a pediatrician. These folks are really a fringe group who place all of the community at risk of serious diseases by not vaccinating their children. I am a retired pediatrician who has advocated for full vaccination for our families. Pediatricians and all responsible physicians practice with the knowledge of protecting families and the entire community to the best to of our ability. A recall of a courageous senator is irresponsible. Dr. M. Lee Stone Retired Pediatrician Saratoga Letter writer should practice civility The letter from Matt Rode (Letters, Aug. 9) is a striking example of how quickly the thin layer of civility and mutual respect that is prerequisite to a working democracy can wear off. His vehement and vindictive tirade invites anyone disagreeing with his position for state-mandated schoolchildren vaccination to leave the state. This is chilling and misguided. Vaccine critics are not freeloaders nor IQ challenged. Many just want a better control on vaccination schedules, in the suspicion that vaccination risks are routinely underestimated, underreported and under-compensated. They also question why United States has the highest number of requested vaccines in the world. Jack Bauer San Jose No free lunch — fossil fuels style Tim Dec (Letters, Aug. 8) writes “Studies have shown that by placing a slowly rising fee on fossil fuels and returning all of the funds to families, we will not only reduce CO2 emissions 50 percent in a few decades, but we will also grow GDP and create jobs.” I question why we restrain this apparent economic miracle to fossil fuels alone. Surely by exactly the same mechanisms a fee on anything else returned to families will grow GDP and create jobs as well. This is of course absurd. No amount of taxing Peter and Paul and rebating it to Paul and Peter will overcome the economic inefficiencies of artificially making energy more expensive. Over a few decades these inefficiencies compound considerably. It may be worth it to burden our progeny with less wealth to give them a less warmed world, but it is mistaken to pretend we’re providing them a free lunch. Michael Peercy Los Altos Clinton? You kidding? It was Dubya and crew Jeb Bush has a lot of nerve to blame the rise of ISIS on Obama and Clinton. It was his brother, puppet master Dick Cheney and hawkish Donald Rumsfeld who opened Pandora’s box and set the Middle East on fire. And now Jeb Bush claims he has a better idea. Let’s send our men and women in once again and pour some gasoline on the smoldering rubble. Andreas Goedde San Jose Tags:  Letters Mercury News Readers Subscribe Today!

 You don't need to have a computer science degree from Stanford to be working on one of Google's hottest teams Jillian D'Onfro Aug. 12, 2016, 5:35 PM 9,050 facebook linkedin twitter email print Not, to our knowledge, a Googler Ian Gavan / Getty Images Machine learning and artificial intelligence are some of the hottest fields in tech right now. While the terms have kind of become buzzwords in startup land, Google has had teams doing research and building AI-driven applications for years.  For example, the company established its "Brain" group five years ago and the team has since penned dozens of papers, built an open-source AI system called TensorFlow, and influenced a bunch of Google products and services like Photos, SmartReply, and speech recognition.  The team held a question and answer session yesterday on Reddit, and one of the most striking parts (to someone not entrenched in that world, at least) was reading about the crazy-diverse backgrounds that Google Brain team members have. You might think that to be working at one of the preeminent machine learning groups, you would have to have a degree in computer science from Stanford. But you'd be wrong.  Here are some of surprising paths that Google Brain employees have taken: Chris Olah : Did one year of pre math at University of Texas, dropped out to help his friend dispute an arrest, got a Thiel Fellowship to do 3D printer research, started being interested in machine learning, joined Google Brain as an intern. Martin Wattenberg : Had a background in math, but worked in journalism for his first six years out of school. Doug Eck : Undergrad in English literature and creative writing, while self-training as a programmer. Eventually did a PhD in computer science, focused on music and AI. Dan Man é : Majored in philosophy. Geoffrey Hinton : A degree in experimental psychology, followed by a year as a carpenter. Before getting to Google, he did get a PhD in AI. "Machine Learning is such a new field though that degrees matter less than you might think," senior research scientist Greg Corrado writes. "I think all you really need to get started is a college level foundation in Vector Calculus & Linear Algebra, plus proficiency in Python, C++, or similar." Brain's newly launched Residency Program specifically looks for people with different specialties to go through a 12-month internship-like role that dives into deep learning techniques. "We actively encourage people who have non-traditional backgrounds to apply," TensorFlow product manager Zak Stone writes. "We believe that mixing different perspectives and types of expertise can spark creative new ideas and facilitate closer collaborations with other fields."

Russian company Yandex was shut out by Google, authorities ruled. Photo: Alexander Zemlianichenko Jr., Bloomberg Google fined for breaking Russian antitrust rules with Android 1 / 2 Back to Gallery Russian antitrust officials have fined Google $6.8 million, a relatively small penalty that nevertheless represents the latest in a growing list of global regulatory problems for the search giant. Russian authorities ruled last year that Google had abused its market position with Android, its mobile operating system, by favoring some of its digital services over those of rivals, including the Russian company Yandex. As part of its ruling, the Federation Anti-Monopoly Service said Google’s rivals had not been able to include their own offerings, like digital maps or search, in the Android operating system that powers a majority of smartphones and other mobile devices in Russia. The agency said Thursday that Russia’s competition rules applied to all companies operating in the country, including foreign ones. Google denies breaking Russian competition rules. The Mountain View company is still appealing the Android case in Russia, which was opened last year after Yandex complained that its services for Android were being treated unfairly. “We have received notice of the fine from (the Federation Anti-Monopoly Service) and will analyze closely before deciding our next steps,” Google said Thursday. In much of the world, Google has come to dominate. But it has failed to do so in Russia, where Yandex retains more than 50 percent of the market, according to industry statistics. While the Russian fine is akin to a rounding error compared with Google’s $75 billion in annual revenue, the ruling against Android is the newest setback for the company amid mounting global competition investigations into the search giant’s activities. Margrethe Vestager, the European Union’s top antitrust official, charged Google in April with unfairly using Android to promote its own services — like Google Maps and Google Search — over those of its rivals. European Union officials have also charged the company in a separate competition case, accusing it of favoring some of its search services over those of rivals. They filed a third set of charges in July linked to Google search services offered to third-party websites, like newspapers and online retailers. Google denies wrongdoing in those cases, saying that it competes on equal terms with companies such as Yelp and Microsoft, among others. It also says cell phone makers are free to use Android-based services provided by rivals. Google does not make money directly from licensing the mobile operating system to companies, but it takes a cut from advertisements displayed on online searches. The company’s antitrust woes have also spread to the United States, where the Federal Trade Commission is considering claims that Google’s activities linked to Android are uncompetitive. U.S. officials previously investigated whether the company had unfairly favored some of its services over those of rivals within its search engine, but they eventually decided not to bring charges. In India, one of Google’s fast-growing markets, the national antitrust authority sent the company a report last year outlining its concerns about search dominance and anticompetitive behavior. The Indian officials suggested that the company is abusing its dominant market position by ranking its services ahead of those of competitors in Google search, according to people familiar with the report, which has not been made public.

CLOSE Saudi Arabia World Opinion Business Technology Sport Rio Olympics 2016 Life Art & Culture Drive Explore Faith Fashion Wednesday, November 23, 2016 SG ePaper Saudi Arabia World Opinion Business Technology Sport Rio Olympics 2016 Life Facebook in cross hairs as fake news battle heats up Saudi comedian Nasser Al-Qasabi quits ‘Arabs Got Talent’ Bieber plays soccer with Neymar at Barcelona’s training camp Bollywood modernizing feelings on intimacy, says ‘Befikre’ actress Mos Def to avoid S.Africa trial over ‘world passport’ AllArt & CultureDriveExploreFaithFashion Home Opinion Editorial Palestine never was on Google Maps Opinion Editorial Palestine never was on Google Maps Aug 13, 2016 2259 0 SHARE Facebook Twitter Late last month, Google did the unthinkable. It reportedly wiped Palestine off the face of the Earth. Palestine was reportedly erased from Google Maps, after which followed a Twitterstorm. The outcry was so great that 250,000 people signed a petition but the petitioners apparently got it wrong. Google Maps didn’t delete Palestine as claimed. In fact, it hasn’t changed its labeling of the region at all. A search for “Palestine” in Google Maps today would get the same result as before the Twitter uproar. What apparently happened is that a glitch in the system removed the labels for Gaza and the West Bank. So, is Google working actively in Israel’s favor, or were people too quick to jump on the hashtag #PalestineIsHere without realizing what they were tweeting about? The answer is yes and no. Palestine was never on Google Maps, at least not as a country. A search for Palestine on Google Maps shows a demarcated area where it should be but does not mention it by name. It has always been treated as a “disputed territory”, along with Kashmir and Crimea, and marked with a dotted border, the symbol Google uses to show disputed territory. Google does label Palestinian cities as Palestinian, and the Wikipedia-sourced Knowledge Box that pops up describes Palestine as a “de jure sovereign state”. That language has been in effect since 2013, when Google — following the lead of the United Nations – changed its designation to “Palestine” from “Palestinian territories”. The label of Israel is applied to regions outside the Palestinian areas. Still, even if the current outrage is misplaced, the country of Palestine does not appear on Google Maps while Israel, established on Palestinian land, is clearly designated. And Jerusalem, which is claimed by both Israel and Palestine, is listed as Israel’s capital alone. This is an important issue, as Google Maps are now regarded as definitive by people around the world, including journalists, students and others carrying out research into the Israel-Palestine problem. The majority of UN member states recognize Palestine as an independent state, and it is an official non-member observer state at the UN where its flag flies. The omission of Palestine from Google Maps is a grievous insult to the people of Palestine and undermines the efforts of the millions of its people and their supporters who are involved in the campaign to secure Palestinian independence and freedom from Israeli occupation and oppression. Whether intentionally or otherwise, Google is making itself complicit in the Israeli government’s disenfranchising of Palestine. Google’s actions take place in a context of increasing reactionary discourse and scapegoating of Arabs and Muslims. Politicians—best exemplified by Donald Trump—are stoking racism and directing popular discontent toward Arabs, Muslims and immigrants. Users view Google Maps more than a billion times each week. It’s one of the world’s largest sources of geographic data and the first place many turn to locate something. Mapping technologies like Google also end up shaping our understanding of the world. For users, it’s important to remember that sites like Google, which are supposed to be removed, detached and authoritative, could bring their own interpretations to politically charged issues despite their stated intent to provide as much discoverable information as possible so that users can make their own judgments about geopolitical disputes. Users must thus try to think about maps of Google critically and to register their displeasure when they perceive what looks like a political statement. Google should not distort history or manipulate geography or tamper with the Palestinian people’s right to their homeland, On the whole, reports of Google deleting Palestine from Google Maps are false. Google never identified Palestine at all. That’s not a defense of Google’s failure to identify Palestine but an attempt to illustrate Google’s historical failure to identify Palestine.

According to the Center for the Study of the Workplace, women represent around 20 percent of engineering graduates, but just 11 percent of practicing software engineers. Unconscious bias is one of the primary drivers of this disparity, which has led many of Silicon Valley’s leading tech companies to introduce unconscious bias training to their employees. However, it’s fair to say that its machine learning algorithms need it more. What is unconscious bias? In humans, unconscious biases are ingrained assumptions about particular personal attributes (including race or gender) that can influence decision making without the decision maker being explicitly aware. These biases are universal because they are the result of “mental shortcuts” people make based on social norms and stereotypes - this group is like X, that group does Y. Numerous studies, such as this one from the UNC Kenan-Flagler Business School, have shown that unconscious biases have a significant influence on important decisions, such as hiring or promotions. In an effort to improve diversity and create a more welcoming work environment, companies are working hard to train their employees about unconscious bias, its implications and how to counteract it. For example, Google put a majority of its employees through workshops on how to understand and stop unconscious bias, and Facebook developed an internal training course called Managing Unconscious Bias, which it released to the public. Can an algorithm be biased? While these companies are taking admirable and necessary measures to actively educate its tech employees about unconscious biases, the systems they are building still seem vulnerable. Consider personalized online advertising. Carnegie Mellon University conducted experiments on Google ads, which found that significantly fewer women than men were shown online ads promising to help them get jobs paying more than $200,000. According to CMU, this raised questions about the fairness of targeting ads online, as a gender bias was clear. Related: How Entrepreneurs Can Spot Subtle Bias Racial bias is also an issue. Latanya Sweeney, the former chief technologist at the Federal Trade Commission, uncovered racial bias on the basis of Google searches, according to a report in The Nation. Sweeney found that black-identifying names yielded a higher incidence of ads associated with “arrest” than white-identifying names. In neither of these cases did a programmer sit down, and write an explicitly sexist or racist algorithm. Instead, these biases are the work of machine learning algorithms that learn patterns automatically on the basis of the large data sets they are presented with. Just like humans do. And just like humans, machine learning algorithms are susceptible to developing biases which, if not explicitly checked for and corrected, lead to discriminatory behavior. How can an algorithm be biased? There are many potential reasons why machine learning systems can learn discriminatory biases. One is selection-bias in the training data. If the model is trained on a dataset that is not representative of the population, then it will make poor general inferences. For example, the miscategorization of a black man by Google Photos in 2015 led many to question whether the algorithm’s training data had predominately comprised white people. Hidden variables are another factor. It might seem possible to avoid biased machine learning algorithms by making sure you don’t feed in data that could lead to such problems in the first place. If you remove race and gender data from the equation, how can the bias prevail? Related: Meet RankBrain, The New AI Behind Google Search Results Earlier this year, a study of Amazon Prime showed that predominantly black zipcode areas were conspicuously denied same-day delivery. Amazon won’t reveal the details of how it determines eligibility for same-day delivery, but the company almost certainly does not feed “race” into its models explicitly. The problem is most likely that race turned out to be a hidden variable behind the model, meaning there were other reasons why Amazon’s model excluded the zipcodes and race turned out to be highly correlated with those reasons. Third, machine learning systems can discriminate by perpetuating existing social biases. Biases run rampant in our society. We know that women are heavily under-represented in the board room, and there are significant racial wealth gaps. If you train a machine learning algorithm on real data from the world we live in, it will pick up on these biases. And to make matters worse, such algorithms have the potential to perpetuate or even exacerbate these biases when deployed. What can be done? As machine learning expands into sensitive areas - such as credit scoring, hiring and even criminal sentencing -- it is imperative that we are careful and vigilant about keeping the algorithms fair. Accomplishing this goal requires raising awareness about social biases in machine learning and the serious, negative consequences that it can have. Just as tech employees are educated about the negative implications of their own unconscious biases, so should they be educated about biases in the models they are building. Related: Overcoming Unconcious Bias Is Key to Building an Inclusive Team It also requires companies to explicitly test machine learning models for discriminatory biases and publish their results. Useful methods and datasets for performing such tests should be shared and reviewed publicly to make the process easier and more effective. As an industry we need more research into how machine learning algorithms can be trained to avoid undesirable social biases. This issue is a relatively new phenomenon, and the examples we have seen so far are just the tip of the iceberg. More research needs to be done to better understand the problem and determine what technical solutions can be deployed to minimize the risk of unconscious bias creeping into machine learning systems. It’s time for the risks of social bias to be embedded deeply in data science codes of ethics and education. Richard Sharp Richard Sharp is the CTO of Yieldify.

I’m dropping 40 pounds. I’m working my way to a chiseled set of Michelle Obama arms. The problem is, I’m not. I never do. I fail. Instead, I sink into the couch and binge-eat chocolate peanut butter ice cream and binge-watch Netflix. It’s just easier. Besides, I barely have time to shower, let alone work out. I work full time. I have three kids in three different sports. I cook, I clean and I’m cooked. Translation: I’m too busy making excuses (and getting fatter and lazier) to make time to work out. If I really want my taut bod from before I started this cerebral yet sedentary job -- back when I routinely ran and did karate and yoga while being a stay-home mom --  I have to commit. Commit to fit or whatever rah-rah perky thing fitspo types say. Related: I Tried Google Goals for a Week. The Result: I Meditated, Hydrated and Hibernated More Than I Ever Have Before. Putting my money where my 'hangry' mouth is Two weeks ago I finally did commit. I made a $200 “commitment contract” to work out four times in two weeks, for at least a half-hour each session. I blame my editor Linda Lacina, an avid runner and pilates practitioner. She put me up to this, “for JOURNALISM,” of course, and I’m glad she did.     I’d be a guinea pig, a willing, albeit rotund one. I pledged to break a sweat in my dusty garage gym on the regular. If I failed to log eight workouts in the allotted time, I’d lose the money and a thick chunk of my pride, neither of which I easily part with. I'd rather lose a thick chunk of thunder thigh. Weird things are happening on #fitnesschallenge. I actually WANT to ?. Came back to finish reps post- #DNCinPHL pic.twitter.com/1FkCDcFh8U— Kim LachanceShandrow (@LaShandrow) July 29, 2016   The tool Linda and I agreed that I’d use StickK to stick to my promise. Designed by behavioral economists at Yale University, it’s a free motivational mobile app- and web-based platform that leverages the fear of losing money to help people adhere to their life goals, fitness-related or otherwise. The idea is to give them that extra nudge to foist themselves up off their duffs and into action. Some people wager as little as five bucks. Others as much as several thousand dollars. I went for a safe $200, reluctantly entering my credit card number into the app. Losing that relatively wimpy amount would be just enough to sting when my three kids ask for haircuts or when it’s my turn to buy a week’s worth of groceries. Wonky run, but @stickK -ing with it, cuz $ on the line. Last day of #fitnesschallenge, but start of new habit ??? pic.twitter.com/VV7xALekFd— Kim LachanceShandrow (@LaShandrow) July 30, 2016   Keeping me honest Financial stakes aren’t StickK’s only motivational sticks (as opposed to carrots). Accountability factors in, too. The tool prompts users to choose an optional accountability “referee.” I chose my 11-year-old daughter, who’s quite the young stickler. I knew she’d keep me honest. Also, I wouldn’t lie to her or fudge my results for her. What kind of “adulting” example would that set? To be my referee, she had to sign up for StickK, too, and manually verify my once-a-week self-reported progress reports. To be extra sure I really worked out, she would join me in the gym, and even take turns lifting weights with me. Going a step further, I also took StickK up on its option to select a “supporter.” I picked my husband, Adam, who’s currently whipping my butt on yet another fad diet we’re braving together, the keto craze. He’s sticking to it (and down 20-plus pounds). I just pretend to be on it. Related: 6 Apps That Help You Stick to Your Goals It was Adam who stood to gain $200 if I blew off my StickK fitness commitment. I’d sheepishly put him down to receive the cash in the event of my failure. The choice, per the app, was to either pay someone I know or donate the $200 to charity. Miffed at not being able to choose a specific charity to donate the money to, should it come down to it, I opted to keep the cash in the family, through StickK’s “friend or foe” option. My other half, always in the mood to take me out on the town, would probably spend it on me on date night anyway. If choosing a spouse is sort of cheating, well, call me a cheat. At least I admit it. When it comes to sticking to a commitment, money makes all the difference, says Jordan Goldberg, co-founder and CEO of StickK. “Attaching a financial incentive to your personal goals reinforces your resolve and willpower and increases your likelihood of success,” he tells me during a phone interview. Per StickK’s research, he points out, its users are three times more likely to succeed in achieving their goals than those who don’t use the app. Hmmm. We’ll see if that rings true with yours truly. Here’s how sticking to StickK worked out for me:   Saturday, July 16 Getting started was the hardest part. I resisted the idea of working out so hard that I didn’t bother changing into workout clothes. In protest, I wore my usual plain Jane black T-shirt and skinny-ish mom-jeans. Gross, I know. Once on the NordicTrack treadmill to warm up barefoot for 10 minutes at a quick clip and on a steep incline, I realized that my outfit choice was a big, dumb and very jiggly mistake. Mental note made: Invest in a super supportive sports bra ASAP. Oh, and sporty sneakers. Those might be smart, too.    Treadmill-shame spiral behind me and my heart rate slightly elevated, I stepped up to the “barely used” nautilus machine my husband shelled out $1,000 for (without first warning me so I could mentally prep for the sticker shock and then scream “NO! We’re not buying that torture device!”). It’s a cold, hulking mass of pulleys, hooks, pins and heavy metal, all of which I want nothing to do with it. Then again, I don’t want to lose $200 from my personal savings account, so I climbed aboard and pumped myself up, one weak, shaky rep at at time. I repeated each set of 12 reps three times, grunting and face-scrunching all the way. Tip: Making faces makes it look like you’re working out hard. Thank goodness I was alone, at least at first. My husband and daughter joined me halfway through when I texted them asking how to properly connect and use the hanging pull bar thingy. I didn’t really care how. I just didn’t want to work out alone. I focused on my legs, lifting a feathery 40 pounds with my thunder-thigh quads. No pain, so maybe no gain. Next, I moved to my upper body, crunching light curls, pulling painful flies and ripping do-able tricep extensions, all with nominal weight, nothing above 30 pounds. I didn’t want overdo it on day one and not be able to comfortably walk and talk, or worse, be unable to text and type the next day. Priorities, people. Take 2. Sticking to $200 @stickK #fitnessgoals bet. Article soon on @Entrepreneur. Can't quit now. #thepressure pic.twitter.com/HdNlvbIUMT— Kim LachanceShandrow (@LaShandrow) July 29, 2016   Sunday, July 17 Sore and cranky doesn’t begin to cover how I felt upon waking. Tired, too, due to my sciatic nerve acting up all night as I tossed and turned on our new, burnt toast-firm memory foam mattress (specifically purchased to help with my bum back). Ashamed was the next feeling to follow, as I grasped just how out of shape I’d let myself become with every mildly painful step. My quads were on fire, my arms throbbed with a dull ache, and my abs -- wait, I remembered that I had abs and felt them beneath the several inches of cushioning I’d packed on. At least they were in there somewhere.    Resolved to do anything but more weights and more treadmill drudgery, I convinced my family to head for the beach for a workout. I’d read about the day-after benefits of swimming post-weight-lifting in Muscle and Fitness Hers’s July/August 2016 issue that I’d overambitiously purchased to kick off my StickK challenge. According to a blurb in the magazine, swimming kills two birds with one stone: It’s “a great way to recover after a hard strength day or to get in some fat-burning cardio.” Swimming also wrings out the post-workout lactic acid buildup in muscle fibers. It’s also a fun way to distract yourself from what you’re doing when you do it -- exercising. An added reward, apart from the physical bennies, is that I enjoyed some rare quality time out under the sun with my husband, my eldest son, my daughter and her doppelganger best friend. Together, we battled the choppy Seal Beach, Calif., surf for two exhausting hours straight. Related: No Time to Exercise? 3 Reasons Short Workouts Are Better Than Longer Ones More winded than I’d been in a long time, I didn’t mind the stinging foot and back scrapes I picked up from being uncontrollably dragged across the shore like a bumbling fool in front of onlookers plunked on the sand, my bathing intermittently suit lifting up and exposing my love handles here and there. So what? I’d had a good time with my family and I didn’t give a rip what anyone thought. Wait a minute? I actually enjoyed working out for once and I wasn’t self-conscious of my body at the beach. Now that’s progress -- maybe even a breakthrough. To celebrate, I undid all the calories burned in the salty drink and scarfed down gobs of artificial cake batter-flavored Cold Stone ice cream. Hey, this isn’t a diet challenge. Maybe that’s next, but, for now, one goal at a time. Monday, July 18 I worked out with my StickK referee tonight, my very physically active daughter, a rough-and-tumble lacrosse player who is also a bit of drill sergeant, but in a good, motivating way. We took turns doing weights -- arms and legs, the usual three sets of 12 reps per exercise. She helped me warm up and stretch before we started, using stretches she picked up at her California State University, Long Beach, sports camp this summer. I was glad for the quality one-on-one time with her. If we didn't lift together, we would have lazed about, zoning out on Netflix mind-junk and carb-loading just because. This is a more productive, fun and healthier way to make memories with her. I wish my sons would join us, but they’re too busy Pokémon Go-ing at the local park. I guess that counts as exercise, too.   Digging into her drill sergeant role, my daughter screamed my rep count in my face at close-enough-to-smell-her-breath range. I returned the favor and screamed right back in her face. We broke out in giggles at times at how silly we sounded and looked. To keep up our momentum, she insisted on pumping Adele and Jason Mraz through the gym-garage Sonos speakers, which wasn’t anywhere near as upbeat as I’d like for workout tunes. But I shut up and took one for the team. I was still a touch sore from the first day, but pushed through. I took my former editor and avid weightlifter friend Rafe Brox’s advice and went up in weight in some exercises to test out how much strength I can muster. Just as he suspected, I found I could handle more weight indeed, even if only 10 pounds more than the day before per exercise.   Tuesday, July 19 Up to this point, working out had begun to feel like a habit, thanks to this StickK challenge schtick. But then, boom, I hit a wall. I was tempted to quit this probably too-ambitious-for-me bet. Why did I sign up for this racket in the first place? Oh, wait. That’s right. It’s an actual work assignment. There was no turning back. I was locked and loaded (and overweight and bloated). On top of feeling like a loser who wanted to quit, there was the guilt that comes with failing to work out. Instead of lifting weights, I lifted nothing with my arms other than overpriced and quasi-healthy groceries from the new neighborhood Trader Joe’s to my car, then from my car into my house. Truth is, I carried two bags and my daughter schlepped five, all in one trip. She’s an overachiever hellbent on proving her competence and might to the world. Gee, I wonder where she learned that? In a warped way to make up for not running, an activity that’s tantamount to chewing thumbtacks for me, I whipped up a quick keto diet dinner. Rather than head for the garage gym with my StickK accountability coach, I taught her how to properly brown organic grass-fed beef. Poor kid -- she’s a vegetarian.

Bonus: Eerie piñata. pic.twitter.com/5VA9fAayfi— Kim LachanceShandrow (@LaShandrow) July 22, 2016   Wednesday, July 20 It was my birthday. I could not work out if I wanted to. And I didn’t want to. Instead, I headed for a special dinner out with my husband and two of my kids. (My middle son was still away on a trip with friends in Oregon and I missed him something awful, obviously a reason to stress-eat.) To celebrate, I pigged-out on a double-portion bowl of Gorgonzola gnocchi. That was after I inhaled a slice of fresh-baked rosemary focaccia bread. Later, down the hatch went a perfectly stacked pyramid of cannoli, sweet cannoli, drizzled in chocolate sauce and dolloped with heavenly mounds of fresh-whipped sweet cream. Chianti wine sure went fine with each course, right down to the big finale, Carvel ice cream cake. Where was my young accountability coach to reign me in? She knew better than to bug me to exercise on my birthday. Smart kid. Now you know why I picked her. Thursday, July 21 Back on the fitness horse (and a couple of pounds heavier than when I started this crazy bet), I pretty much owned the weights machine. With guilt-fueled gusto, I had a belly full of Thai boba tea and jalapeno slice-topped buttered popcorn that I gorged myself on while watching the new Ghostbusters movie earlier in the evening with my daughter and niece. Dieting on girls’ night out isn’t a thing, right? Getting started was challenging again. Tired, stuffed and desperately seeking Friday, I was tempted once more to be a lazy schlub and skip my scheduled workout. But then I remembered the $200 I’d lose if I slacked. Oddly, I also kind of sort of felt the urge to work out. Maybe I really was forming a new habit, like StickK’s co-founder said I would. I also dug that my arms had started to look a little less like big, fat loaves of white bread. I clung to that mini-win for motivation. There’s also the fact that if I failed to suck it up and exercise, I’d have less money to pay our air-conditioning bill with. My husband’s fears confirmed, we were up $200 in one month over what we normally pay. I have everything to do with the increase and he knows it, thus why he’s asked me to fork over the money and pay the bill out of my savings. He’d warned me to cool it with the cooled air and I ignored him. Speaking of cooling down while the mercury rises, breaking a sweat in an already sweaty, sweltering southern California heat wave isn’t as awful as I thought it’d be. I opened both doors to the garage, big and small, to let the wind whip me while I worked out. Once again, I upped the weight of some of my lifting exercises, feeling a twinge of pride as I hoisted the pull bar. The lesson: With a little more effort, I could handle a lot more. Progress doesn’t take long when it comes to fitness, not if you stick to it.   Keeping the momentum going, I dusted off the poster that came with our nautilus machine. Looking bewilderedly at the glut of sample exercises on it, it hit me that I was skating by doing the bare minimum. From then on, I beefed up my routine and focused more on my lower body, not just on my arms, chest and back. Next up, the human hamster wheel, the treadmill. I half-assed it on the squeaky machine after lifting weights. I cranked up the incline to the max and walked at a brisk pace for a half-hour while my husband and daughter pumped iron in intervals. At least I was on the darn machine. Related: Why Exercising Is a Higher Priority Than My Business Friday, July 22 Workout? What workout?! Was I still doing this StickK deal? All of the kids and my husband were out and about and I had the house -- and garage-gym -- all to myself. So, naturally, I decided to sprawl out on my bed and stare blankly at my smartphone for hours, “exercising” my brain. More like rotting it on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter, all of which I’d quit for good, clearly. I was again depressed about my 13-year-old still being away in Oregon. Feeling sorry for myself, I chose the creature comfort inactivity and slovenliness over what I really needed -- the adrenaline and confidence boost working out never fails to deliver.   Saturday, July 23 Same depressing deal as yesterday. I’ll spare you the carb-loaded details. The best I could do was watch a movie about someone who exercised, jumped and sprinted his way past far bigger hurdles than I’ve ever faced on an inspiring journey to four Olympic gold medals. That someone is the late, great Jesse Owens. Me? I was apparently preparing to snap a medal for procrastinating and making excuses not to work out. Sunday July 24 Still stubbornly avoiding the treadmill and weight machine, I forced my family into another day of “quality time” at the beach. They, too, wanted to laze about the house and watch TV or play Xbox, but I wasn’t having it. If I had to get up and active, they had to, too. For a third Sunday in a row, we drove to nearby Seal Beach again and beat ourselves up in the angry waves, arms and legs constantly moving. Exercising at the beach was becoming a habit and I was sticking to it, and keeping my $200 StickK money in the process. Again I squeezed my plump trunk into a bathing suit like sausage in an opaque black swimsuit casing. I was even chunkier than last summer, and I didn’t want to be seen in a bathing suit then either. My hesitancy could have something to do with the 40, yes, four-oh, pounds of excess weight I’m lugging around. Inspired by this fitness bet, I’ve realized that my kids are getting older, I’m not getting any younger and I don’t want them to remember me being so overcome with self-imposed body shame that I wouldn’t swim with them. I didn’t even take so much as a dip during the three years we lived at our last house, which had a pool. Add to my newfound desire to model embracing body positivity that I’m extremely competitive by nature. I wasn’t about to let my own self-sabotaging habits cause me to crack and quit one more time. So there I was again, floating in the waves on my back, my red-painted toes peeking out from the seaglass-green surf, forgetting for a blissful minute about StickK-ing to it, forgetting about work deadlines and swimming upstream in a perpetual state of catch-up. I kept my legs churning water, horizontally scissor-kicking to hopefully melt away some surplus thigh sludge, not that I hold out any hope for a thigh gap. (I’m 41, not 21, OK?) I swam out out deeper and deeper over my head, ensuring that I’d have to constantly tread. Who knows, maybe I’d even shed a pound, which I hadn’t managed to do on this fitness bet yet. All of the post-workout celebration beers and pasta and popcorn-fests canceled out my progress. I waded out deeper and deeper, far ahead of my group. I’ve always been one of those annoying people who has to walk or apparently swim at the head of the pack. From my vantage point, I assigned myself the role of spotting swells girthy enough to body surf on. My husband, son, daughter and son’s friend body-slammed into wave after wave, throwing their shivering selves headlong into the frothy breaks. I wasn’t brave enough to get whipped around like a ragdoll. Wave spotting, I’ll take it. It’s is a much safer bet. We grew soggy in the surf, staying submerged for about two hours total. Not bad, especially as I was perpetually in motion. So what if I blew off the gym again? This was more fun and it still counted as a workout. Plus, we’d made more good family memories and I’d learned to let go a bit and relax. The benefits of breaking a sweat were adding up and new habits were being reinforced. Related: The Shocking Lessons I Learned After I Quit My Social Media Addiction in 3 Days in the Desert Monday, July 25 Jogging was my friend. My goal was to keep moving on the treadmill, to get the blood pumping, but not at a full-run pace, and move I did. After completing my treadmill warmup, I switched to weights, churning out curls, bench presses, arm and leg extensions and more.    I came *this close* to not working out because I wanted to watch the Democratic National Convention on TV. Even if I still felt the Bern, I wasn’t about to miss a woman being nominated for president for the first time in American history. My dutiful daughter and perhaps future president, my very capable stickler of a StickK accountability coach, reminded me that I could watch history unfurl from my phone, outside in the gym “that Daddy built for you” via Facebook. Dang, she was good. Real good at guilting me. At one point the treadmill was so loud under my pounding Nike Free RN Flyknits, combined with the din of my daughter’s rhythmic grunts as she pushed through her lifting regiment, that I switched to a Gawker Facebook Live DNC feed. It showed Bill Clinton’s teleprompter as his speech happened, revealing the parts he ad-libbed through. I noticed that being distracted by news as it happens was another great way to get through a workout, a welcome distraction that made the time fly. Visualizing spending the $200 StickK money I was saving by obeying my fitness commitment on a new outfit also helped me keep my eyes on the prize. Wednesday, July 27 Today was workout-in-a-dress day, because why the heck not? I just happened to be wearing a casual cotton halter cover-up dress and my daughter wore a striped sailor-type dress. Neither of us felt up to changing into workout clothes. Besides, better to take advantage of not working out in a gym surrounded by sweaty strangers anyway. I started off by taking it easy on the treadmill once again for a few-minute warmup. So geriatrically slow I strutted that I might as well have worn a leather fanny pack filled with stool softener pills. Easy like Sunday morning, but not quite.     When you @stickK to fitness bet + workout in dresses w/your daughter while watching @cnn #DemsInPhilly on FB live pic.twitter.com/wYrzp0qdyT— Kim LachanceShandrow (@LaShandrow) July 27, 2016   A neighbor drove down the alley my garage opens to and did a double-take at us. Must’ve been the dresses. Meanwhile, my dog Oso stretched on the hot concrete floor, panting in the 84-degree southern California heat. Occasionally, he trotted over to the treadmill, staring at it, then at the ground and down at his paws. He probably wondered why the floor didn’t move beneath him, too. Watching him do this cute routine cracks my girl up every time. I mean, it is pretty funny. He’s not the sharpest pup in the kennel. Now that I think of it, you can add logging quality time with my pup into the growing lists of the benefits of sticking to this StickK deal. The proof is in the *pulling.* Workout 1 on bet. Weights + run 9 miles/week for 2 weeks or pay up. @stickK #getit pic.twitter.com/MOgswdxNBQ— Kim LachanceShandrow (@LaShandrow) July 17, 2016   Friday, July 29 Today marked a milestone. My fitness commitment and resulting assimilation were complete. I’d worked out more than four times in two weeks. I also stopped giving a rip about the $200 I could’ve lost and the bragging rights I won. I achieved my goal despite my inherent physical laziness and ineptitude. Today was also different for another reason. Something had finally clicked and the change was palpable. I genuinely wanted to work out, and in the garage, not in my lazy river ocean. I felt like I had to. I needed to. Of course it could’ve been the scary story I wrote today about a study linking time spent binge-watching TV to blood clots that can kill you, but I’d like to think it was sheer force of habit. A habit I’d built up, day after day, like a muscle.   I chugged through my routine like a machine, on both the treadmill and nautilus. I wouldn’t go so far as to say my workout had become old hat, but it had become easier, even comforting to complete. Running, which I’d avoided to the best of my procrastinating ability, was even becoming routine. I even liked it and my legs were no longer stiff and sore. They were even looking more toned and muscular. Nah, I probably just imagined that. My last triumphant StickK commitment workout behind me, my family gathered around the kitchen table to celebrate the only way we Lachance-Shandrows know how: by eating our feelings. Yep, even the happy feels. My husband had grilled cheeseburgers (and a veggie burger for my vegetarian daughter). I’d built up an appetite for his cooking, having repeatedly huffed the savory scent of flame-seared beef teasing my nostrils as I finished a hearty run on the treadmill. Working out to justify eating, I’d gotten used to it in just a couple of weeks.

Now, surprisingly having stuck to my StickK fitness commitment, technically within the admittedly safely lax-ish boundaries and expectations I purposely put in place for myself, I’m stronger and healthier than before I started. For the first time since I packed on the pounds, I’m inching toward liking the curvaceous body I see in the mirror after I emerge from the shower. At least I’m actually looking at it now instead of looking away, which I did for years. Yes, the middle-aged bonebag encasing me is still plenty doughy, and my thick thighs still involuntarily collide, but with each workout I sweat out, it gets firmer and tighter. I’m a work in progress and working out progresses me closer to my goal of losing 40 pounds. As for the $200 I refused to lose, I’m still giving it to my husband. I more than owe him for perpetually spotting me thousands upon thousands of dollars over the past 20 years. He deserves it for building us a gym that I now regularly use. Without an accountability app such as StickK, and without my husband’s support and my daughter’s goading, I’d stand in the gym eating chocolate bars, watching my husband work out alone, like I did before this whole adventure. Now I get in there with him and run for my life, to invest in it and hopefully lengthen it for more time with him and with my kids, now and for the long haul. I’ve gotten so into it that I’ve even surpassed my husband in my workout frequency, doubling how much he works out in a week, but he doesn’t need to know I told you. Somehow, he’s still kicking my ass at our weight loss bet anyway. The winner scores enough money to buy an entirely new wardrobe. I’d better play some catch up, starting with a five-mile run on the dreadmill. Turns out, once you get used to it, it’s not so dreadful after all.      Made goal. bet $ = mine to keep, w/healthy habit. Worth time + effort.

The initial commit of the first code was on the 24th of June this year. Fuchsia artwork   The code was discovered by the website Phoronix and unfortunately information about the OS is sparse. Google writes in the code Pink + Purple == Fuchsia (a new Operating System). The code also shows that Fuchsia is built around Magenta and LK (Little Kernel). “Magenta is a new kernel that powers the Fuchsia OS”, a Google developer writes. It seems to be a layer over the Little Kernel where both have their advantages and disadvantages. A Google developer writes about that, “Magenta inner constructs are based on LK but the layers above are new”. So far the OS seems to only running on the Acer Switch Alpha laptop. This is a Intel Core i5 powered device with 8GB RAM and a 256GB SSD that normally runs Windows 10. It has a liquid cooled CPU, 4K output and a 12″ touchscreen. We found also references to the Raspberry PI and Surfacebook in the code, these might be devices for which support is underway.

Somehow I doubt this will have any real-world advantage over lightweight GNU/Linux distros. On top of which, if Android is any indication, Fuchsia will probably be heavily tied into Google's advertising network, which means no one can escape Google's cyber-stalking without disconnecting from the internet (unless the Electronics Frontier Foundation's lawsuit against the anti-circumventions of the DMCA bears fruit). 0 Agree Register Login Register to Myce.com Register in 10 seconds, pick a username, enter your mail address and proof you're human, that's all!

PTI Published  Aug 13, 2016, 12:07 am IST Updated  Aug 13, 2016, 12:07 am IST Imagine a Google-Glass type “smart” eyewear that can integrate augmented reality with your own and feed you live information about your surroundings. Imagine a Google-Glass type “smart” eyewear that can integrate augmented reality with your own and feed you live information about your surroundings. A new portable system developed by researchers may make this possible. Wearable displays also have the potential to enhance cognitive ergonomics, or more simply, make it less mentally taxing to complete certain tasks, researchers said. But before technologies like Google Glass become a part of daily life, engineers need a way to monitor exactly how they affect the brain in everyday situations, they said. Researchers from Drexel Univers-ity in the US developed a portable system that can do just that. The system uses functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to measure a person’s brain activity. The system can integrate augmented reality with your own, feed you live information about your surroundings and even be used in the operating room, researchers said. The applications for fNIRS are seemingly endless — from training air traffic controllers and drone operators, to studying how students with disabilities learn best, they said. “This is a new trend called neuroergonomics. It is the study of the brain at work — cognitive neuroscience plus human factors,” said Hasan Ayaz from Drexel University. Until now, most studies involving fNIRS took place indoors. Though participants wearing the system could move around freely while being monitored, they were still observed within laboratory confines. Now, researc-hers have brought their portable fNIRS system “into the wild.” They successfully measured the brain activity of participants navigating a college campus outdoors. Researchers wanted to compare one group of participants navigating the campus with Google Glass to another group using Google Maps on a smart phone.

Advertisement NEXT:5 Biggest Posts of the Past 5 Days PREVIOUS:Gap Debuts First Post-W+K Campaign by Untitled Worldwide What The?? Who Filed Fake Copyright Infringement Complaints Against AgencySpy? By Patrick Coffee on Aug. 12, 2016 - 3:00 PMComment Earlier this year, someone using a fake name, a fake employer and a fake job description filed a fraudulent Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) takedown request with our parent company’s legal team. Here’s what almost certainly happened: A reputation PR firm had a client who wanted a post written way back in 2010 to disappear from Google’s search results forever, so an employee of this firm copied and pasted our post into a fake news story, backdated it to make the claim more believable, then used a fictional but official-sounding identity to threaten our employer with unspecified legal action. This attempt was temporarily effective in that we unpublished the story. That’s not something we’d normally do, but given that the post was 6 years old and we weren’t aware of the context, we figured it was appropriate. We recently put the post back up, because the takedown request was a big lie. We don’t know exactly who did it. That said, when someone tries to get rid of posts headlined “Hot Ad (Wo)Man of the Day: Torrence Boone” and “Google Hires ‘Unemployable’ Torrence Boone,” it’s valid to suspect that the person behind the effort might be Torrence Boone … who is currently a vice president at Google working closely with that company’s ad agency partners. Boone’s lawyers have repeatedly denied to AgencySpy that he was involved in the takedown requests or that he had any knowledge of the effort that appears to have been made on his behalf. They admit he has occasionally “hired digital marketing firms to manage his online profile” but claim that “they have not taken any action directed toward [your company] on behalf of Mr. Boone in March 2016, or at any other time.” Tellingly, though, his lawyers spent most of our exchange last week arguing against the content of the “unemployable” post rather than discussing the request to take it down six years later: “In reply to your email to Mr. Boone, he disputes the defamatory blog post reportef [sp] by AdWeek in 2010 that he was ‘unemployable’. Mr. Boone stands by his service at Enfatico.” That’s the short version of a very odd story. Here’s the long version. * Torrence Boone is currently VP of global agency sales and services at Google, which many rightly see as the single most powerful company in digital advertising. In other words, he is the man responsible for managing Google’s dealings with at least a few of its many agency partners. Way back in January 2010, our predecessor’s predecessor Matt Van Hoven aggregated AdAge’s report on Google’s decision to hire Boone following the collapse of a WPP unit called Enfatico, for which he had served as global CEO. The “unemployable” quote in the headline came from agency veteran and “AdScam” blogger George Parker, who posted on what he called the “sad, pathetic end of Enfatico” two days earlier. For context, WPP launched Enfatico, which it called “the agency of the future,” to handle the Dell business in 2008. The client later broke up with WPP after the holding company folded what had been Enfatico into the Y&R organization, and Sir Martin Sorrell called it an experiment that “went wrong” in telling Forbes India that the project had failed because “the two prime movers behind it left Dell.” We asked Parker about this story, and he wrote, “I have no personal history with Boone. I did talk to him a couple of times by phone after he attempted to do some damage repair on my widely read AdScam posts taking the piss out of the so called ‘Agency of the Future’ Enfatico.” Three months after the hiring story ran, Van Hoven published the “Hot” post, which included an image of Boone “at Carnival 2009.” Flash forward to March, 2016, when the legal team at Adweek’s parent company Mediabistro Holdings/Prometheus Global Media received a copyright infringement claim from someone calling him or herself “Jennifer Clandon, Sr. Journalist, Fox18 News.” This person used an email address with the URL Fox18News.com, linked to the Carnival image post above and claimed that the domain was “engaged in unauthorized activities relating to my copyrighted materials.” Here’s a screenshot: At the time, the URL in that email went to a post that was an exact replica of Van Hoven’s — quite literally word for word. The alleged “article” was dated two days before the Spy post first ran. We let our tech and legal teams handle it because we were working on other things, but the original post went down because, on first glance, it did indeed appear to be the same story. We didn’t think about it again until an anonymous group calling itself Web Activism, which appears to be dedicated to exposing fraudulent DMCA requests, sent us this link concerning a nearly identical request regarding the Google hire post. Its headline reads, “Google’s VP Torrence Boone behind fake DMCA notice sent to Google !!” Now, if you try to visit the “Fox18” link in the above email, you’ll notice that it goes to a 404 page. That’s because Fox18news.com was a fake site temporarily created by the responsible party specifically to facilitate scam requests like this one. And there is no one named Jennifer Clandon working at “Fox18” or any other company, because no such person exists. Confused? So were we. Matters have become clearer, however. In a post addressing the claim related to the “unemployable” story, Web Activism links to an incident report for the DMCA request via Lumen, a collaborative archive of filings like this one. That summary notes that the site on which said AgencySpy story allegedly first appeared was LewisburgTribune.com, with the date listed at January 12 — or the day before Van Hoven’s post went live. In case you hadn’t already figured it out, LewisburgTribune.com was never a real news site. That URL, along with Fox18News.com, has been linked by Web Activism to unknown parties allegedly attempting to get unflattering stories regarding their clients’ persons or businesses removed from Google’s search results. We have sent several emails to jennifer.clandon@fox18news.com over the past two weeks, and we know it is still a working account created by a real person because we haven’t gotten any “delivery failed” notices. But you will almost certainly not be surprised to learn that we have not received any sort of response and don’t expect to. The Lumen database also includes a separate entry for a 2012 request made by Boone himself, who asked that Google remove the “Hot” post because it contains allegedly copyrighted materials in the form of “A picture of me at a Carnival parade in a costume that includes a blonde and orange clown wig.” It’s unclear whether Google responded to this request. There are a number of firms specializing in “reputation maintenance” that engage in this sort of activity in the hope that an editor or legal advisor will do exactly what we did: Take a story down after receiving an official-sounding email complete with vaguely threatening legal jargon because they would rather not deal with it. This is not a new practice. But we wanted to learn more, so last Monday we contacted Mr. Boone. He chose not to interact with us directly, instead forwarding our email to his lawyers at the firm of Engel & Schultz in Boston. Here’s what they had to say: “In reply to your email to Mr. Boone, he disputes the defamatory blog post reportef [sp] by AdWeek in 2010 that he was ‘unemployable’.   Mr. Boone stands by his service at Enfatico, that he did as fine as job as CEO as possible under the circumstances, that he left the WPP  Group on good terms  when he accepted an excellent opportunity at Google, where he has since continued to rise in that organization.” A representative for the law firm in question continued, “We consider these unfounded assertions against Mr. Boone as further defamation of his good name.” After an additional request for clarity, the lawyer wrote: “From time to time, Mr. Boone has hired digital marketing firms to manage his online profile … they have not taken any action directed toward [you] on behalf of Mr. Boone in March 2016, or at any other time.” He then declined to name the firm that currently represents his client. We weren’t even aware of these posts prior to receiving the “Clandon” email and the Web Activism link, because they were written several years before our time editing this blog. We have no knowledge of or disagreement with the individual in question or what was the Enfatico organization, and we would also note that — should any person want a comment deleted or a post headline tweaked — he/she should simply reach out to us directly using his/her real name like everyone else. Boone’s lawyers claim that his reputation firm never contacted our parent company to demand that the offending post be taken down, that they have no knowledge of the incident, and that neither Boone nor the aforementioned, unidentified firm have any idea who may have filed these fake complaints. As we see it, there are very few potential explanations for this series of events. < Previous Article Next Article > Advertisement Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

Edition: Global   One News Page “Probably the fastest-access news portal in the world” HOME WORLD SPORTS POLITICS BUSINESS PEOPLE SCITECH Business Markets Money Real Estate Legal  • Corporate News •  One News Page > Press Releases > Myrtle Beach Wins #1 Beach in US National Google Consumer Survey by Landslide Victory Myrtle Beach Wins #1 Beach in US National Google Consumer Survey by Landslide Victory Tuesday, 2 August 2016 To get an unbiased, fact-based view into the best beaches in the US, the Tipspoke team used a rigorous 4-part process leveraging the Google Consumer Survey platform to survey thousands of people across America. Myrtle Beach landed in the number one spot at the top of the list. Boston, Massachusetts (PRWEB) August 02, 2016 There are many opinion-based lists of the best beach in the US, but Stacey Sao, the master researcher behind recreational information hub Tipspoke, decided to get an unbiased, fact-based answer. She followed a rigorous 4-part process with Google Consumer Surveys to make this happen. The results for the best beaches in the US are in and Myrtle Beach South Carolina was the clear winner. “Myrtle Beach didn’t just win --- it won big with over 87% more votes than the second place finisher. When we do a bit of digging, it’s clear that this is because of the range of activities available both on the beach and surrounding it,” said Ms. Sao, the CEO of Tipspoke. “The number of activities and attractions is simply amazing – everything ranging from amusement and water parks to golf to wildlife adventures.” “Myrtle Beach continues to rise in these national measurements because of what nearly 18 million visitors already know – our beaches are clean, safe and inviting,” said Brad Dean, president and CEO of the Myrtle Beach Area Chamber of Commerce. “What truly sets Myrtle Beach area apart from others is the fact that visitors consistently comment on two main themes, one is simply the vast array of attractions and events that appeal to both the young and the old, the couples and large groups; and two is the friendly southern hospitality visitors experience from our citizens and businesses that keep them coming back time and time again.” The combination of four attributes makes this survey representative of popular opinion across the country. (1) It was not limited to a specific readership, i.e., subscribers to a travel website, but rather distributed broadly across the US. (2) It did not offer a pre-set list to choose from; instead, it asked an open question for the respondent to fill in their “favorite” beach without any aid or bias. (3) It did not ask the respondents to rank on any single dimension, but rather their overall favorite. (4) It was published randomly to thousands of adults in the US through the Google Consumer Surveys and ran until over a thousand responses were completed. Bloggers, travel websites, and publications are free to use the survey data or chart when accompanied with a courtesy credit and link to https://tipspoke.com.

Language Log Home About Comments policy Mo River Spengler August 12, 2016 @ 2:08 pm · Filed by Victor Mair under Lost in translation, Names « previous post | next post » Rachel Kronick has a knack for finding strange foreign equivalents for Chinese toponyms on Baidu, China's foremost online encyclopedia.  See "The city of Mr. Andreessen, South Korea" (4/22/14). Now she has struck paydirt again with "Mo Ri River Spengler" for Mòrìgélè hé 莫日格勒河 in the Baidu encyclopedia. For Mòrìgélè hé 莫日格勒河 Google Translate has "Mo River Spengler", Baidu Fanyi has "Mo Spengler River", and Bing Translator has "MO River". Wherever or however it started, you can find various transformations of the name of this river that contain "Spengler" strewn all over the web. Mòrìgélè 莫日格勒 is the Chinese transcription of the Mongolian name, which is Mergel.  This is a narrow but extremely meandrous river in the Hulun Buir League (Kölön Buyir qota ᠬᠥᠯᠥᠨ ᠪᠤᠶᠢᠷ ᠬᠣᠲᠠ) of Inner Mongolia.  Judging from the tremendous number of photographs available on the web (do a Google search under Mo River Spengler), the grassland scenery there must be spectacularly beautiful, especially at sunset (Sonnenuntergang [Ch. rìluò 日落]), though lately there has also been news of many dead fish clogging the river due to pollution. Juha Janhunen has investigated the language of the Khamnigan Mongol speakers who live in the Mergel basin (see ch. 4 of his The Mongolic Languages), so perhaps he would know the actual etymology of "Mergel", insofar as it is possible to determine one. Based on previous experience, I would expect such weird proper names within translations as "Mo River Spengler" to come from mis-parsed bilingual texts used to train translation engines. I've described examples of exactly that sort of foul-up in previous posts on Chinglish.  The thing is that the original texts that cause such blunders tend to be easy to find, but in this case I haven't found one.  Consequently, I'll have to hypothesize several possible glitches in the training process. A transcription of "Spengler" ending in -gélè 格勒 should be involved. Oswald is surely the most celebrated Spengler, and the usual transcription of his name does indeed end in -gélè 格勒:  Àosīwǎ'ěrdé·Sībīngélè 奧斯瓦爾德·斯賓格勒.  The identity of the last two characters in the Chinese transcription of Spengler's surname and the last two characters of the Chinese transcription of the river name Mergel, i.e., Mòrìgélè 莫日格勒, surely must be the main trigger for the confused machine translation. Oswald Spengler is universally famous for his masterwork, The Decline of the West (Der Untergang des Abendlandes), Chinese title Xīfāng de mòluò 西方的沒落.  We already know what happened to the last two syllables of the Chinese transcription of the Mongolian name Mergel.  How about the first two syllables, mòrì 莫日?  These two syllables, which literally mean "not day", are perfectly homophonous with mòrì 末日, which means "end time; doomsday".  In addition, they partially overlap in sound and meaning with mòluò 沒落 ("waning; decline"). Another possible trigger for the mistranslation:  David Goldman, a political commentator who writes (used to write?) under the pseudonym "Spengler".  Western commentators whose views are (circumstantially) aligned with the Party's are often mentioned (or even write) in state media, so that could have been a possibility. An example of the phenomenon: this article on an official website of the Chinese Communist Party by William Engdahl which mentions Spengler (the Younger) in the transcribed form Sīpénggélè 斯彭格勒, with the same two tell-tale final syllables. Note that Goldman / Spengler's two recent books both also have to do with the collapse of nations and civilizations: It’s Not the End of the World, It’s Just the End of You: The Great Extinction of the Nations (2011) How Civilizations Die (and why Islam is dying too) (2011) This explanation of how the internet got from the Mongolian river name "Mergel" to the Chinglish designation "Mo Ri River Spengler" may strike readers as unduly sinuous, but, hey, that's the shape of the Mergel after all.

I suspect Li Bai and Du Fu used that sound. When did Mandarin (with all its predecessors) lose that sound? Is there any text in English you can recommend that will answer this and other similar questions about how certain sounds got lost? Many thanks! Nick Bathrobe said, August 12, 2016 @ 4:23 pm The deeper background to the problem is that Mandarin is now the de facto standard for rendering place names in China. The principle that Chinese-character names should be convertible back to the original language seems to have been almost completely abandoned, if it ever existed. (I was always under the impression that China under Mao, at least, respected the place names of minority ethnic groups, although I could be wrong.) The Chinese now appear to consider Kashi the true name of Kashgar, Lasa the true name of Lhasa, Huhehaote the true name of Hohhot, Erlian the true name of Eren(hot), etc. The names of particularly well-known places (like Lhasa and Kashgar) hang on in many English-language sources, although sinified versions are more and more commonly seen. But less well-known places seem to have been completely sinified. If my memory is correct, the railway station at Erenhot (Èrliánhàotè, known to the Mongolians as Ereen) bears the English-language name of "Erlianhaote Station". I was once trying to read a Mongolian-language article (in the traditional script) about water issues in Inner Mongolia, where many lakes and rivers are shrinking or disappearing. I had some difficulty finding English language names for many bodies of water or rivers. Sometimes I could find a Chinese name, but either there was nothing on the Internet about that lake or river in English, or the only English-language references used the Chinese name (which is simply a transliteration of the Mongolian name). I think this failure to respect local language names in China is behind problems that Baidu and others experience finding names like "Mergel". If there were decent sources for finding the original names it would not be such a problem. But if the original names are completely ignored in China, the only version available for international consumption is the transliteration, hence mangled names like "Mo Ri River Spengler". Bathrobe said, August 12, 2016 @ 4:37 pm Incidentally, Kölön Buyir qota means Hulunbuir City (呼伦贝尔市 Hūlúnbèi'ěr shì). It was previously a league, when it was known as 呼伦贝尔盟 Hūlúnbèi'ěr méng or Kölön Buyir ayimaɣ. Rachel said, August 12, 2016 @ 6:11 pm Thank you for the research, Dr. Mair! Mongolian is on my list of languages to learn, but time has never allowed it, so the true name of the river was unavailable to me. It's wonderful that you've found it. I suspect that the most famous Spengler in Anglophone countries is not Oswald, but the fictional character Egon, from Ghostbusters, played by Harold Ramis. See https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E4%BC%8A%E6%A0%B9%C2%B7%E5%8F%B2%E8%B3%93%E6%A0%BC%E5%8B%92 . That doesn't seem to change the effect of your theory, though; I wouldn't be at all surprised if the most famous Spengler is still Oswald in China and the rest of the world. Bathrobe said, August 12, 2016 @ 6:59 pm I agree that it is very impressive that Professor Mair found the Mongolian name. Googling "莫日格勒河" turns up Morigele River, Mo Ri River Spengler or Moergele River. Googling "莫日格勒河 river" doesn't turn up "Mergel river" in results. Only if you google "莫日格勒河 Mergel" will you find "Mergel river" — and even that is not the first result. "Mergel" is buried so deep that it may as well not exist for Google. Not a naive speaker said, August 13, 2016 @ 5:21 am Hi, some googling and guessing and the map collection of Utexas resulted in this index map of Manchuria The meanders of this Mergel river might be on sheet NM51-7 YA-K'O-SHIH. There are two large happily meandering rivers on this sheet: the larger one Hai-la-erh Ho, the smaller one north-west Mo-erh-ko-er Ho I have no clue if one of the names is a butchered translation/transcription. Some of the watercourses are unnamed, it might be one of them. Bathrobe said, August 13, 2016 @ 7:46 am I would say that Mo-erh-ko-er Ho is Wade-Giles (without tones) for Mòěrgé'ěr Hé, probably 莫尔格尔河, another way of sinicising "Mergel gol" (Mergel River). Transliteration of Mongolian into Chinese is not fully standardised. Both 莫尔格勒 Mòěrgélè and 莫勒格尔 Mòlègé'ěr can also be found on the Internet. Googling "Мэргэл гол" will turn up Mongolian sites mentioning the river. Victor Mair said, August 13, 2016 @ 8:33 am From Juha Janhunen: I have spent several months on the shores of the river Mergel, but the etymology is unclear to me, like that of most other hydronyms in the region. The names can be pretty old, even Pre-Mongolic and Pre-Tungusic. However, the Mo River issue reminds me of the way the Chinese distort all non-Chinese personal and place names of the former Manchu empire which they now administer under the name of PRChina. Giovanni Stary has written about this problem in connection with Manchu names. Even uninformed western sources have started speaking of historical persons like "Nuerhaqi" etc. instead of what should be Nurhachi etc. Michael Watts said, August 13, 2016 @ 3:15 pm To stray off topic, I have heard there is V in Cantonese and Shanghainese. I suspect Li Bai and Du Fu used that sound. When did Mandarin (with all its predecessors) lose that sound? If by V you mean the voiced labiodental fricative, it exists in mandarin as an allophone of /w/. When I asked a Shanghairen about the pronunciation of 勿 in shanghainese, I was told (n = 1, here, so be careful) that [f] and [v] are equivalent sounds in shanghainese (which they are not in mandarin – [f] is the phoneme /f/, and [v] is the phoneme /w/). I have no information at all on whether shanghainese includes the sound [w]. Michael Watts said, August 13, 2016 @ 3:19 pm the Mo River issue reminds me of the way the Chinese distort all non-Chinese personal and place names of the former Manchu empire which they now administer under the name of PRChina. Giovanni Stary has written about this problem in connection with Manchu names. Even uninformed western sources have started speaking of historical persons like "Nuerhaqi" etc. instead of what should be Nurhachi etc. This definitely happens, but I think it's an inevitable part of speaking a non-Manchu language. I had a friend tell me she was fond of "Benedict Cumberbaqi". There's no malice there; it's just that Chinese people know the Chinese names of things. English distorts non-English names too; there's really no way not to. :/ Bathrobe said, August 13, 2016 @ 3:47 pm @not a native speaker That map is a rare find. It's not the sort of map that Chinese would find pleasant to see, however, because it obviously dates from the period of Japanese control of Manchuria. While most of the place names are in Chinese in Wade-Giles transcription, and in some cases in Chinese characters, there are certain parts that give Japanese names in Rōma-ji. For example, Kuridōru-ka, Torumoruji-ka, Sei Irakutochī-ka, Tō Irakutochī-ka (where ka is 河 'river', sei is 西 'west', tō is 東 'east'), Porudōno-san, and Kammunega-san (where san 山 is mountain). These are concentrated in a certain part of the map. Neither the Chinese nor the Japanese names seem to be much of a guide to the pronunciation in the original language(s). Jichang Lulu said, August 13, 2016 @ 4:04 pm Shanghai has separate /f/ and /v/: 放 fã, 房 vā (the tones are different, but that difference is not phonemic). 勿 has a /v/. There is a [w] glide. Jichang Lulu said, August 13, 2016 @ 5:49 pm Wrong diacritic in my previous comment: 放 fã, 房 vã (both with the same nasal vowel). Joseph Bottum said, August 14, 2016 @ 12:39 am I assume you mean the joke of using "meandrous" for the Mòrìgélè hé, since the word is itself a very rivery word—"meander" coming to us from the Greek name for the Meander River in Asia Minor, thought the most meandrous river of all. Jichang Lulu said, August 14, 2016 @ 9:00 am @Nick The common ancestor of modern Mandarin, Cantonese, Shanghainese (etc.) had a v sound, as well as other 'voiced' sounds like b, d, z. Those have been lost in Mandarin and Cantonese, but are preserved in Shanghainese and other related varieties. For example, the character 房 'house, room' begins with an f- in Mandarin and Cantonese, but with a v- in Shanghainese, as it's assumed it did in mediaeval Chinese. Tang poets like Li Bai and Du Fu most likely had a v- there. Michael Watts mentions that in many northern forms of Mandarin, pinyin 'w' can have a sort-of-V-like pronunciation, especially among younger female speakers. That happens if the following vowel is a or e, but not if it's o or u. Actually, that sound isn't a labiodental fricative [v] like that of English or Shanghainese, but a labiodental approximant [ʋ]. That's the usual pronunciation of e.g. Dutch w (some forms of Dutch have three labiodental phonemes /f v ʋ/. This is a separate phenomenon from e.g. Shanghainese /v/ preserved from mediaeval Chinese. Mandarin [ʋ] occurs in syllables that wouldn't have had a [v] in the Middle Ages. (Of course there might be speakers of Mandarin who have an actual [v], but that's not the pronunciation you'll hear from e.g. newsreaders as it's considered non-standard by the Relevant Departments.) If you're interested in getting an idea of what Tang poetry might have sounded like, you could have a look at David Pager Branner's transcriptions (e.g. here starting around p. 25). You might find some v's there. Nick said, August 14, 2016 @ 11:27 am Thanks for the responses to my intrusive query! -Nick Michael Watts said, August 14, 2016 @ 3:02 pm Actually, that sound isn't a labiodental fricative [v] like that of English or Shanghainese, but a labiodental approximant [ʋ]. That's the usual pronunciation of e.g. Dutch w (some forms of Dutch have three labiodental phonemes /f v ʋ/. This makes me curious. Speaking English while smiling, I can produce a labiodental nasal instead of [m], or a labiodental approximant instead of [w]. That labiodental approximant sounds to me like a /w/. The allophone of Mandarin /w/ that we've been discussing sounds to me (only native language： American English) like a /v/. What's making the difference?

Google, also facing antitrust investigations elsewhere in Europe, favored its own and its partners' apps in the "priority positions on the home page" of devices the Android operating system, creating a disadvantage for other apps, Russia's Federation Antimonopoly Service said Thursday. The ruling will provide "an opportunity for the development of competition in the mobile software market in Russia, which will benefit our customers," the agency said in a statement. In September, the Federation Antimonopoly Service found that Google had abused its market dominance with Android, in a ruling setting up the fine. The antitrust authority opened the case in February 2015 following a complaint from Russian search engine Yandex, which also develops mobile apps and runs its own Android app store.

Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 5.47pm EDT 17:47 Helen Pidd If you’re wondering why the team pursuiters are hitting faster times in the velodrome tonight than they did in yesterday’s qualifiers, here are a few hypotheses: Tonight the teams are competing against each other rather than simply riding their own race one at a time. That brings an advantage for the faster team in the pairing, because they can benefit from what British Cycling (BC) refer to as “circulating air mass”. In other words, slipstream. The faster team can get into their rivals’ slipstream, even if they are still some way from lapping them. The boffins at BC reckon the advantage can be worth 20-30watts. That’s what they call a marginal gain. Someone might have shut the velodrome doors. It certainly feels hotter in here tonight. Dame Sarah Storey reportedly reckons she narrowly failed at breaking the women’s hour record because someone opened the doors in the velodrome in London. They’re trying a bit harder.

SUBSCRIBE Using popular culture to drive local positioning Local search columnist Lydia Jorden delves into how businesses can utilize hot trends in news and popular culture -- like Pokémon Go -- to drive SERP positioning and a presence in the local digital ecosystem. Lydia Jorden on August 12, 2016 at 10:07 am More Pokémon Go, the hit new augmented reality game for mobile, has increased foot traffic to specific businesses substantially. Individuals playing this game are tempted into specific areas called PokéStops to collect free items to use in the game. If a business is within range of a PokéStop (which is currently out of a business’s control), it has an immense opportunity to capture additional customers they otherwise may not have captured. Larger companies are often quick to jump on popular culture to increase business and brand awareness and engage with the community. Along with many others, Zoe’s Kitchen is just one of many businesses utilizing the Pokémon Go craze to offer deals to players. Zoe’s Kitchen is able to keep the entire conversation online, while increasing online-to-store foot traffic — a perfect example of engaging an entire community around a worldwide phenomenon while also advancing business: Local businesses can join the fun, too Larger businesses aren’t the only ones who can capitalize on pop culture trends to drive business. So how can local businesses join the conversation? It might be helpful to look at what local businesses are already doing. Let’s take a look at a couple examples of local businesses who are tapping into pop culture to further their engagement with the community — and also discuss how these activities can elevate local listing positioning. Example 1: Snowbank Brewing Expanding a strong social media strategy to assist in strengthening local positioning In the crowded space that is the craft brewing industry, Snowbank Brewing in Fort Collins engages the community on a fun level throughout its various social media posts. In late March, Snowbank Brewing created its first “crowd-sourced beer,” a beer designed by the brand’s customers. Fans participated in a poll in which they voted on their favorite grains, hops and SBV, and the beer they created as a result of this poll was dubbed the “Open Source IPA.” Many visitors were requesting, both online and in the tap room, the ability to vote for the name of the beer, as well as the ingredients. Snowbank Brewing responded to this demand by creating a spinoff of the Open Source IPA, which they called “Beery McBeerface” — a nod to the recent “Boaty McBoatface” story that took the internet by storm. Snowbank Brewing capitalized on a timely pop culture phenomenon here, and this is a prime example of how small businesses can use these opportunities to ignite conversation and engagement in the local space. To better connect this interactive engagement to advance local search positioning, a business in Snowbank Brewing’s position could execute on a variety of strategies: First, take to the website to allow people to vote for beer names through poll-like functionality. Social media engagement is great for its intended purposes, but to further local search positioning, we need people to spend more time on-site. Encouraging your audience to be on your website increases visitors to the site, increases visitor time on the site, and also allows people to explore throughout the site (added bonus for brand to consumer engagement — less for local positioning). To influence your positioning, you can encourage visitors to vote once per day, as you want customers to come back and solidify a strong presence on the website. Second, update Google My Business with recent photos and a company description that moves as the brand evolves with targeted keywords. As we know, Google favors fresh content, and local search behavior is constantly changing; we need to adapt our language to the changing behavior. To identify trends in how searchers behave, I would go to Google’s Keyword Planner. (After some keyword research, for this example, I  learned that the term fort collins brewery yields about 2,400 searches/month, while breweries in fort collins delivers 720 searches/month.) Then, move forward using keywords on the site with high search volume per month. Finally, continue updating Google+ to reference pop culture as it becomes relevant with those keywords (Google favors Google). All of these elements can aid in advancing positioning within the local pack. Example 2: UCHealth A seamless mix of pop culture, sports and brand awareness When the Denver Broncos were crushing it last season, Colorado-based UCHealth harnessed an opportunity to connect one aspect of its expertise (identifying an illness) with popular culture, resulting in a Broncos Fever campaign. The campaign highlighted festive Broncos fans admitting themselves for care, only to find out that they have Broncos Fever. The fun spin on the fever illness, coupled with the local hype surrounding the Broncos’ performance, resulted in a campaign with improved local performance. UCHealth engaged the community on a level that wasn’t just focused on healthcare. The contagious support of the Broncos increased inbound links to the site, and citations soared as community excitement built around the campaign. Domain authority jumped. This helped elevate rankings in the search space, along with overall optimized content including videos and expanding on-site keywords. By fusing the timeliness of the Broncos’ success with local marketing across a variety of platforms, UCHealth’s local listings appeared more often in the local pack for multiple branded and non-branded keywords. By connecting local strategy, UCHealth was able to further optimize on-site content with keywords that drive local search traffic based on keyword research, which then translated to overall stronger local search positioning. Major takeaways Finding a way to connect to pop culture to your business will differ greatly per industry when working to increase local search presence, but the techniques we can use to influence Google’s local algorithm remain the same. Thinking creatively can be difficult, but if a business can find a way to capitalize on recent events and trends, they may find that consumers engage more with the brand — and a natural progression takes place to help elevate local ranks (e.g., inbound links). When the market is as flooded as it is for many industries competing on a local level, connecting to pop culture may be the main differentiation between competitors to engage the community. Use the tools and examples described above to aid in brainstorming potential ways to connect to pop culture while also advancing local search engine positioning.

(Reuters/Mike Blake) Share Written by Joon Ian Wong August 12, 2016 GV, the unit of Alphabet formerly known as Google Ventures, has all but stopped investing in startups at their most nascent stage. According to data from research firm CB Insights, GV completed no seed-stage deals in the first half of this year, down from 10 such deals last year. That represented a 77% drop from the number of deals it did in 2014. Here are GV’s seed-stage deals charted: GV’s former chief executive and co-founder, Bill Maris, stepped down after an eight-year tenure on Aug. 11, putting David Krane, a former Google public relations chief, in charge. Maris, 41, told Recode he was leaving because “everything is great” and that he wanted to spend more time with his 11-month-old son and wife. Maris told the Wall Street Journal in December that he was cutting fewer checks at the seed stage because he thought that market was overheated. He also said that he was mystified by the reluctance of some portfolio companies to avoid a stock market flotation. “They would benefit from the rigor and discipline that the public market requires,” he told the Journal (paywall). Maris’ exit is just the latest in a trio of departures by top executives at Alphabet, all of them in charge of units that the tech conglomerate describes as “Other Bets” in its reports to investors. Alphabet reorganized itself last October in order to separate Google’s business from its other units, which included GV, smart home appliance company Nest, its self-driving car project, and others. Both the chief executive of Nest, Tony Fadell, and the technical leader of Google’s car project, Chris Urmson, have departed in the last two months. GV is not Alphabet’s only investment unit. Google Capital was formed in 2013 to make investments into more mature companies. Google itself has opened its purse to make direct investments in companies like secretive augmented reality firm Magic Leap and commercial space technology firm SpaceX, according to CB Insights.

Known as Fuchsia, it seems to be a completely different project to Android and Chrome OS, but its purpose remains unknown. Fuchsia was uncovered this week. It first made a public appearance in early July, when Google quietly created a new repository for the operating system on its development server. The OS is open-source, allowing outsiders to peek in and contribute as Google begins to build Fuchsia. Not a lot of code has currently been written. There's a basic kernel, Magenta, that targets "modern phones and modern personal computers" and the beginnings of a user interface stack to create apps. According to notes in the repository, the operating system can already be booted onto the Intel NUC mini-computer and Acer Switch 12 laptop. Support for the Raspberry Pi 3 is said to be coming soon. Google's choice of UI framework, responsible for creating graphical elements like the desktop and windows, has prompted discussion amongst developers. Fuchsia uses Flutter for its user interface, a framework that includes another project called Escher. Escher supports complex effects like soft shadows and light diffusion that appear out of place on the lightweight Fuchsia. In a comment on Hacker News, user pavlov proposed a reason for Escher's presence. The shadow and reflection effects that Escher specialises in are a key component of Google's Material Design Android design language, suggesting Fuchsia will run apps that are styled like current Android ones. "I think the idea here is to build an UI layer that's designed from scratch for Google's Material design language," explained pavlov. Apart from the Material Design focus, nothing else is known about Fuchsia. Google hasn't officially said anything about the OS and speculation is rife about its intentions for the project. A new operating system from a company as sizeable as Google is bound to attract attention and Fuchsia is no exception. There's currently no serious suggestion that Fuchsia is built to replace either Android or Chrome OS, Google's two current operating systems. It could be designed to combine the two into a single merged OS, as has been previously rumoured. The inclusion of a kernel that runs on phones and PCs fits with this idea, although the emphasis on lightweight software makes it less plausible. Fuchsia may be planned as an operating system for internal use by Google. It could be intended to power Internet of Things devices that require a scaled-down core, but the inclusion of a sophisticated UI stack doesn't make sense here. Hacker News users suggested the OS may be intended as a platform for virtual and augmented reality. Here, a complex UI layer is required, allowing developers to create immersive visually appealing content. A slimmed down kernel is also desirable, reducing input latency and creating higher frame rates. Fuchsia could be an OS designed from the ground-up for VR, indicating Google's growing interest in the field. Advanced users interested in the project can download and build it themselves from the source. It comes with a basic kernel, support for a handful of programming languages and a single functioning program. As Fuchsia evolves over the coming months, Google's intentions for the project should become more obvious. It may be some time before it's clear whether Fuchsia is a new device-agnostic OS for consumers or something to run behind the scenes at Google, however.

So far, the company has worked with the likes of Hotel Tonight and even Lyft.More It’s less than a month before Google releases a slew of new software services including Allo, Duo, and Android Nougat, but the company is apparently cooking something that may go beyond what its mobile operating system can offer. Spotted in the Git repository, developers at Google are working on a new operating system dubbed Fuchsia OS, and it may be meant for mobile phones, computers, and other devices. It likely doesn’t have much to do with the rumored merger between Android and Chrome OS, the system that runs Google’s Chromebooks. Related: Google adds a Dashboard to Google Now, but only for the rumored Nexus Launcher This is likely something completely new — the description in the repository says “Pick + Purple == Fuchsia (a new Operating System), and those colors do not represent either Android or Chrome OS. According to Hacker News, Travis Geiselbrech, who worked on NewOS, BeOS, Danger, Palm’s webOS and iOS, and Brian Swetland, who also worked on BeOS and Android, are involved in this project. The new, mysterious operating system will be powered by the Magenta and LK kernel. “LK is a kernel designed for small systems typically used in embedded applications.” reads the repository. “On the other hand, Magenta targets modern phones and modern personal computers with fast processors, non-trivial amounts of RAM with arbitrary peripherals doing open-ended computation.” There’s a lot of discussion going around about what exactly all of this could mean for the new operating system, and whether or not this is indeed meant for an Android and Chrome OS merger, or for something new. Google tells Digital Trends it has nothing to comment about at this time. Chances are we won’t find out anything new for a while, since Fuchsia OS is early in development. We’ll update this post as we learn more about it.

Unconscious bias is one of the primary drivers of this disparity, which has led many of Silicon Valley’s leading tech companies to introduce unconscious bias training to their employees. However, it’s fair to say that its machine learning algorithms need it more. What is unconscious bias? In humans, unconscious biases are ingrained assumptions about particular personal attributes (including race or gender) that can influence decision making without the decision maker being explicitly aware. These biases are universal because they are the result of “mental shortcuts” people make based on social norms and stereotypes - this group is like X, that group does Y. Numerous studies, such as this one from the UNC Kenan-Flagler Business School, have shown that unconscious biases have a significant influence on important decisions, such as hiring or promotions. In an effort to improve diversity and create a more welcoming work environment, companies are working hard to train their employees about unconscious bias, its implications and how to counteract it. For example, Google put a majority of its employees through workshops on how to understand and stop unconscious bias, and Facebook developed an internal training course called Managing Unconscious Bias, which it released to the public. Can an algorithm be biased? While these companies are taking admirable and necessary measures to actively educate its tech employees about unconscious biases, the systems they are building still seem vulnerable. Consider personalized online advertising. Carnegie Mellon University conducted experiments on Google ads, which found that significantly fewer women than men were shown online ads promising to help them get jobs paying more than $200,000. According to CMU, this raised questions about the fairness of targeting ads online, as a gender bias was clear. Related: How Entrepreneurs Can Spot Subtle Bias Racial bias is also an issue. Latanya Sweeney, the former chief technologist at the Federal Trade Commission, uncovered racial bias on the basis of Google searches, according to a report in The Nation. Sweeney found that black-identifying names yielded a higher incidence of ads associated with “arrest” than white-identifying names. In neither of these cases did a programmer sit down, and write an explicitly sexist or racist algorithm. Instead, these biases are the work of machine learning algorithms that learn patterns automatically on the basis of the large data sets they are presented with. Just like humans do. And just like humans, machine learning algorithms are susceptible to developing biases which, if not explicitly checked for and corrected, lead to discriminatory behavior. How can an algorithm be biased? There are many potential reasons why machine learning systems can learn discriminatory biases. One is selection-bias in the training data. If the model is trained on a dataset that is not representative of the population, then it will make poor general inferences. For example, the miscategorization of a black man by Google Photos in 2015 led many to question whether the algorithm’s training data had predominately comprised white people. Hidden variables are another factor. It might seem possible to avoid biased machine learning algorithms by making sure you don’t feed in data that could lead to such problems in the first place. If you remove race and gender data from the equation, how can the bias prevail? Related: Meet RankBrain, The New AI Behind Google Search Results Earlier this year, a study of Amazon Prime showed that predominantly black zipcode areas were conspicuously denied same-day delivery. Amazon won’t reveal the details of how it determines eligibility for same-day delivery, but the company almost certainly does not feed “race” into its models explicitly. The problem is most likely that race turned out to be a hidden variable behind the model, meaning there were other reasons why Amazon’s model excluded the zipcodes and race turned out to be highly correlated with those reasons. Third, machine learning systems can discriminate by perpetuating existing social biases. Biases run rampant in our society. We know that women are heavily under-represented in the board room, and there are significant racial wealth gaps. If you train a machine learning algorithm on real data from the world we live in, it will pick up on these biases. And to make matters worse, such algorithms have the potential to perpetuate or even exacerbate these biases when deployed. What can be done? As machine learning expands into sensitive areas - such as credit scoring, hiring and even criminal sentencing -- it is imperative that we are careful and vigilant about keeping the algorithms fair. Accomplishing this goal requires raising awareness about social biases in machine learning and the serious, negative consequences that it can have. Just as tech employees are educated about the negative implications of their own unconscious biases, so should they be educated about biases in the models they are building. Related: Overcoming Unconcious Bias Is Key to Building an Inclusive Team It also requires companies to explicitly test machine learning models for discriminatory biases and publish their results. Useful methods and datasets for performing such tests should be shared and reviewed publicly to make the process easier and more effective. As an industry we need more research into how machine learning algorithms can be trained to avoid undesirable social biases. This issue is a relatively new phenomenon, and the examples we have seen so far are just the tip of the iceberg. More research needs to be done to better understand the problem and determine what technical solutions can be deployed to minimize the risk of unconscious bias creeping into machine learning systems. It’s time for the risks of social bias to be embedded deeply in data science codes of ethics and education. Richard Sharp Richard Sharp is the CTO of Yieldify.

Then they came for your web browser and your smartphone. And now? They’re coming for your home — and here’s why that’s a great thing. We are, of course, talking about Google! Routers are typically messy and complicated affairs. Without a lot of research, networking can be quite challenging to learn 10 Ways To Improve The Speed of Your Current Router 10 Ways To Improve The Speed of Your Current Router Here are a few simple router tweaks that could make a world of difference on your home Wi-Fi network. Read More and more than most everyday Internet users really want. This gets even more stressful when something goes wrong with a router. Most of us know the good old “turn it off, turn it back on” routine, but past that it usually means hours spent researching problems on tech forums. Google has decided that isn’t great for anyone and has instead created a simple user-friendly router called OnHub Google Announces New OnHub Multi-Protocol Wireless Router Google Announces New OnHub Multi-Protocol Wireless Router Google unveiled its answer to the Smart Home market in the form of a Smart Home hub called OnHub, a standard wireless router also capable of the most popular smart home network protocols. Read More . Here are several reasons why you should think about getting one. 1. Control Using Google’s App For the launch of their brand new and simplified router, Google decided to eschew the standard web interface of nearly every other router and instead create an iOS and Android app that’s used to set up, monitor, and control the OnHub. Ads by Google There is no messing around with web interfaces, hundreds of settings, and network SSIDs. Instead all the setup is done through the Google On app, making it quick and painless to get your network up and running. After setup it provides a multitude of features including a live network map, and the ability to tap on a device for more information like connection status and IP address. Using the app you can perform two types of speed tests: the first is the common speed test between your ISP and your router, the second allows you to test the speed between the OnHub and any connected device, allowing you to determine if slow speeds are because of your connection or your ISP. 2. Ease and Simplicity The overarching theme of the OnHub is a singular focus on simplicity. This isn’t intended as a device for power users — not yet, anyway. The whole user experience has been designed for laymen, removing the jargon and technical aspects of routers that usually intimidate everyday users. There is an option to enable a guest network which can be set up easily through the app, making sure that your private network stays secure but that there is still access for guests if they need it. Another neat feature of the guest network with OnHub is that you can allocate certain devices like your Chromecast or wireless speakers to the guest network, allowing visitors to use only the devices you want them using. But what about that data hogger in your family that slows your network down by constantly streaming Netflix or downloading massively big games? With OnHub, you can switch to Priority mode for your own devices, which is similar to QoS management How to Fix Gaming & Video Lag With an Easy Router Tweak How to Fix Gaming & Video Lag With an Easy Router Tweak Tired of network lag when other people are watching videos and downloading torrents?

IFTTT Support One of the best automation services around is If This Then That (IFTTT) The Ultimate IFTTT Guide: Use The Web's Most Powerful Tool Like A Pro The Ultimate IFTTT Guide: Use The Web's Most Powerful Tool Like A Pro IFTTT is an automation that will enable you to connect 2 services so that, when something happens with one service, a trigger goes off and an action takes place automatically on the other. Read More . Offering connections to over 300 apps and services, it allows you to create “if this, then that” statements (known as recipes) to control and automate your devices. When Google updated the OnHub with IFTTT, it became the first router ever to support IFTTT. This is a pretty exciting look at Google’s plans for the future, but also gives a great and potentially limitless way to automate your life based on your OnHub activity. Google released the above video to show off just a few of the ways that you can take advantage of the new IFTTT integration, including email notifications when someone arrives home, automatically locking your front door when you leave the house, and disabling security monitor notifications when someone is at home. While these suggestions are a great starting point, as with other IFTTT connections, the future possibilities are endless. 4. Powerful Hardware The OnHub is a well-powered piece of hardware featuring a dual-core 1.4 GHz processor, 4 GB of RAM, and a USB 3.0 port. This is unusual for routers because they typically wouldn’t be required to do the level of computing that the OnHub does (possibly hinting at what Google has in store for future updates). There are currently two versions of the OnHub: OnHub from TP-Link OnHub from Asus Both are near identical in technical specs except for two differences. The TP-Link version features a front-facing antenna reflector that strengthens Wi-Fi signals in the direction of the antenna. While the Asus lacks this features, it does have Wave control to set a device to priority on the network by simply waving your hand above the OnHub. While both OnHubs feature LED lights for the status of the device, the TP-Link has an “ambient light ring” which also features a light sensor that can adjust the light ring based on the amount of light in the room. Although this sensor isn’t active at the moment, it may be enabled with a future OnHub update. 5. Improved Wireless Coverage While most routers come with just two antennas to provide Wi-Fi coverage, the TP-Link OnHub comes equipped with thirteen arranged in a circular pattern, which aims to extend Wi-Fi coverage throughout a house, not just in two directions. The Asus on OnHub only features seven antennas, so if coverage is what you need, then the TP-Link has the upper-hand here. Most modern routers are able to broadcast at two different frequencies How Dual-Band Routers Can Solve Your Wireless Woes How Dual-Band Routers Can Solve Your Wireless Woes Using a router that supports the dual-band standard can significantly boost your Wi-Fi speeds in many circumstances. Read More  — 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz — but the two frequencies usually behave as two separate networks with different SSIDs. The OnHub seamlessly merges these two frequency networks into one SSID and will automatically choose the most stable and fastest frequency for any given device. Most devices can’t intelligently switch between 2.4 GHz or 5 GHz and it’s convenient that the OnHub does it for you. 6. Aesthetic Design It’s unlikely that you’ve ever looked at a router and thought “That would look great in my house,” but that’s exactly what Google got right with the OnHub. They even state that the OnHub is designed to “be out in the open” due to its design, both aesthetically and functionally by giving better coverage in an outwards direction from the center of your home rather than tucked in the corner of the room or a closet. Both the TP-Link and Asus OnHub are sleek, minimalist devices designed to look good. You can even get replacement shells for the TP-Link OnHub so that you can make it look even more appealing in your home, rather than the black or blue that come as standard. Sadly, the Asus OnHub is only available in its original slate grey. 7. Frequent Update Schedule When the OnHub first launched in 2015, Google committed to providing software updates every six weeks, and for the most part this has been true. Most of these updates have been small bug fixes and security updates but there have also been interesting updates (like the one adding IFTTT support). With such a robust update schedule, it makes one wonder what Google plans for the OnHub going forward. The announcements for Google Assistant and Google Home at I/O 2016 offer a great starting point for speculation. We already know that the OnHub supports networking standards that Internet of Things devices The Internet of Things: 10 Useful Products You Must Try in 2016 The Internet of Things: 10 Useful Products You Must Try in 2016 The Internet of Things is ramping up in 2016, but what does that mean exactly?

Read More typically use, like Bluetooth Low Energy (LE), Weave, and the 802.15.4 wireless standard. At the moment the router doesn’t make use of these features, but it would seem bizarre for Google to build these into the product if they didn’t have a plan for them. There is also the fact that the OnHub can support up to 100 connected devices, which is far more people than a house normally holds. Of course at the moment this is speculation, but with all the other benefits of the OnHub along with the potential for a software update to unlock some great Smart Home functionality the OnHub seems to be worth the investment.

You might think it's funny starting with an adaptation of the famous anti-fascist quote by Martin Niemöller, but really? In these times, when fascism is creeping its ugly way back into Western politics everywhere? When even a US presidential candidate is starting up the trail towards internment. It's actually not okay (with me). And in terms of writing, it might work if google was on a trail of destruction, but that's not even what you're trying to convey. I just don't get it. Reply Brent August 25, 2016 at 8:36 pm Don't buy the OnHub, and here is why: 1)The advertised USB port does almost nothing. No USB storage. No Printer Sharing. They should not even advertise the USB 3.0 port as a feature because it can ONLY be used to recover the router from a failure. There is a very active Google Discussion on the official OnHub group with Google clearly not promising to ever get the port functional for any other use. 2)Updates are practically non-existent. The very few updates they add REMOVE features to make it more user-proof. Advanced features are buried or broken after the last update. 3)No IPv6 support. In 2016 this is unacceptable for currently in production hardware. 4)All signs point to a dead-end product. This could mean the OnHub project has quietly died or they are working on the next generation of hardware (It would almost be worse if they are moving ahead with a new generation while leaving a half-backed product on the shelves) Some people may say that you shouldn't expect much from a beta product, but my argument is that they shouldn't ambiguously advertise features that they don't follow up with... particularly "frequent updates" and "USB 3.0 port". Also, don't sell a beta product at a premium price! This half-baked product would have been MUCH better implemented as a firmware project for select devices while they work out initial development cycles and roadmaps. They could have selected one or two cutting edge routers to create firmware for, and if you don't like it you can fall back to the manufacturers official firmware. Reply Captain Supersmart August 20, 2016 at 12:31 am Most routers today are super simple to setup it's almost ludicrous. Maybe 5-10 years ago that wouldn't have been the case. So basically, anyone who 'needs' this router must be a complete moron. Reply James Frew September 7, 2016 at 9:59 am It really depends on the brand and whether its provided by your ISP and what they have custom loaded. There are a lot of different configurations that can make it a daunting task for people either just getting online or those with less tech experience.

Reply James Frew August 17, 2016 at 6:03 am Router Reply diablo135 August 17, 2016 at 1:47 am Hello James, This router does seem pretty cool, especially for it's simplicity. and the article was good too. However, I do notice that your answers to everyone's comments all seem to vehemently defend the OnHub. Why is that? Reply James Frew August 19, 2016 at 9:05 am Glad you enjoyed the article. Most of the comments where I have defended the OnHub are where there were sentiments about Google's data collection policies. Others have been to do with "advanced router functionality" which isn't really what this router is about. Its a simplified device and caters towards people that aren't as into tech, which I think is a great thing. Google does have a tendency to cancel projects but I am genuinely hopeful that this is the start of their smart home initiatives and hopefully when they release other products they will update the OnHub to be something like the Amazon Echo. Reply Richard August 16, 2016 at 11:40 pm OK I missed the most important point Where do I get one? Reply James Frew August 17, 2016 at 6:05 am The OnHub is currently only officially launched in the US. Although that doesn't mean you can't purchase it from sellers on Amazon or eBay, but if you go that route and something doesn't work there is no support outside of the US. Reply Carol Elkins August 16, 2016 at 8:31 pm Please forgive an ignorant question, but what happens when an OnHub network goes down? How will an app work to get the router working again? Are they assuming that everyone has a cell phone plan? If one doesn't have a cell phone plan and instead uses the wi-fi network to connect an Android tablet to run the apps, how does the app run if the network goes down? Reply Miron Chumash August 16, 2016 at 6:35 pm I like google solution!!! Reply Cho August 16, 2016 at 5:21 pm What about Port-Forwarding? Anyone with IP cameras and/or media streaming devices need Port Forwarding to direct incoming traffic. My ASUS Rt-AC68 is limited to 32 port forwarding entries in it's tables. This is inadequate for our SmartHome and IPcam requirements. Reply James Frew August 16, 2016 at 5:25 pm There's always a chance that they will add those kind of more advanced features in the future - but my opinion on it is that they are more likely to try and tightly integrate it with their own smart home products like Nest and Google Home (once its released). Reply 4mcpcb August 15, 2016 at 10:19 am I like google solution! Reply Phil! August 13, 2016 at 9:48 pm Once I gave up my control issues I started a love affair with the OnHub. Great coverage, reliable, and simple enough that I'll be recommending it to all those who look to me for home tech support. Reply James Frew August 13, 2016 at 10:02 pm I think Google would be glad to hear that you've had a good experience so far. What did you miss initially from your old router? Reply Christopher Woodhouse August 13, 2016 at 11:17 pm Having clear and easily accessible information from the router on an app instead of obscure browser window on my computer that lets me rename the network and set a custom password so easily. The fact that it updates itself, and in the whole time I've had it I've never lost connectivity (if I did, it told me it was because the modem was having an issue). Reply James Frew August 13, 2016 at 11:18 pm Would you want them to add more advanced features or do you think that what they have is enough for most people? Christopher Woodhouse August 13, 2016 at 11:25 pm For the average person, the OnHub is perfect. I'm not using hyperbole; the average user cannot find a better, easier to use or more reliable router, PERIOD. I know there are some users who crave more advanced features, but frankly I don't think they constitute a large enough group to be profitable (which obviates basically anyone from making this 'power router'). Bud August 13, 2016 at 1:48 pm Unfortunately right now it is more of a access point with a plan port than a router. It is missing a lot of features that normal routers have. No parental controls, no ipv6 support, you cannot block someone from using it with renaming access point and reconfiguring everything else. It does have really good coverage. Get airport extreme for a router instead. Updates have not added any real features. The only real feature that was added was a guest Network. Ifttt support is very limited to events of device connect/disconnect and actions of prioritize (which only works for 2-4 hours). The updates are really just bug fixes. But they do crank one out about every month to 6 weeks. Take a look at the Google OnHub product forum before you buy. Keep in mind that the product is still in BETA. Reply James Frew August 13, 2016 at 10:00 pm You are right that it doesn't currently support those features like parental controls or IPV6, but could you elaborate further on the issue of renaming the access point - this isn't something I've read about before? Although IFTTT and Guest Networks are some of the more high profile updates, as I mentioned in the article for an over-powered router, with far more hardware capabilities than are needed, it seems unlikely that they don't have plans to release a more comprhensive update once Google Home and Google Assistant are released later this year to turn the OnHub into a more fully fledged Smart Home Device. As far as I know the OnHub is a fully released product, with Beta and Developer update channels. The product itself is not in beta. Reply bud August 14, 2016 at 5:50 pm renaming the access point- say for instance you gave (or someone else gave) the wireless password. you can identify the user, but you cannot block the user from using the wireless. the only method supported is to rename the access point and resetup all your other devices to use the new network name. Other router you can block the mac from connecting. They probably do have updates to be compatible with their new devices and products but they have not produced any requested features. and no new features since March (5 months ago). They do not hint nor produce a roadmap for the device. They do not even have a beta channel for testers. As far as the device being in beta, after you own the device and contact support that is what the Google employee will tell you. :) Reply Mark “Mr. Marcus” Major August 13, 2016 at 1:02 pm Sorry about than John H, even though I read point #5, it didn't sink in...eeerrrr, I hate when that happens... Reply Mark “Mr. Marcus” Major August 13, 2016 at 1:03 pm Here's what point #5 states... "Most modern routers are able to broadcast at two different frequencies — 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz — although the two frequencies usually behave as two separate networks with different SSIDs. That means that if a networked device like a Chromecast is on a different network than your device, they won’t be able to communicate with each other. The OnHub sidesteps this problem by seamlessly merging the two frequencies into a single network." Reply James Frew August 13, 2016 at 9:56 pm Does that answer your question? Reply ekrobles August 14, 2016 at 9:33 pm Wrong sir. Devices on the 5ghz channel can see devices on a 2.4ghz channel on every dual band router I have ever used which is a lot. I work IT. Reply fcd76218 August 13, 2016 at 11:53 am One BIG reason why Google OnHub SHOULD NOT be your next router - IT IS FROM GOOGLE. After all, would you want to use a router supplied by the NSA?! Reply James Frew August 13, 2016 at 9:56 pm Google is one of the more privacy focused big tech companies. I get that they do have a lot of user data, and as an American company are bound by the laws of land - but what makes you think that Google is worse than any other company? Or that the OnHub would be more susceptible to law enforcement than any other manufacturer? Reply fcd76218 August 13, 2016 at 11:15 pm You missed my point. I am not talking about OnHub being susceptible to law enforcement. I am talking about Google loading OnHub with firmware that records all the data that passes through it and sending it to the mother ship the way Samsung Smart TVs are doing. "Google is one of the more privacy focused big tech companies" They are focused on THEIR privacy, once they suck up any and all customer/user data. They do not give a rat's behind about user/customer privacy. In fact they trample all over it. "as an American company are bound by the laws of land" Unfortunately, there is no law that prevents Google from slicing and dicing and selling user data to the highest bidder without the consent of the user. At least the NSA does not sell the data they have harvested. Reply James Frew August 13, 2016 at 11:17 pm I would class the NSA under law enforcement. Who do you believe Google sells the data to? In terms of adverts they control the whole AdWords platform so they have no need to sell the data - Facebook is far worse for this. Enoch August 16, 2016 at 9:09 pm Theyyonly bound by the laws of this country until they recieve a letter from some three initial federal agency that requires their unquestioning "cooperation" and forbids them to discuss or even disclose they have received such a "request" for "cooperation." Get one of those and you can't even go before a judge to get it rescinded. Because you're forbidden (in violation of every other law and rule of due process in thiscountry) to even attempt to do so. Don't talk to adults about the "rules" the government and businesses are required to adhere to. Because they don't exist except when the powers that be choose to let them apply. Michael August 16, 2016 at 4:31 pm Don't worry... as long as you're using your Google android phone, accessing your gmail while on Google fiber wifi that is using an OnHub router, your privacy is sealed Reply Chris August 13, 2016 at 5:10 am I've had the TP Link made OnHub for over six months now, and I must say is been a pleasure to own. I have never had a connectivity issue that didn't turn out to be the modems fault (it's rock solid), and I love controlling it from my phone.

LANManic August 17, 2016 at 5:43 pm While there are certainly many connections that Google could snoop, MOST connections to private data are SSL secured - an encrypted pipeline from the client PC to the service - hence the OnHub would merely "see" as encrypted garbage. LANManic August 17, 2016 at 5:48 pm While there are certainly many "texty" connections and metadata that Google could snoop, connections to private data should be SSL secured hence the OnHub would merely "see" encrypted garbage fly by, including "Google search for Duckduckgo" (but they would have that data anyway, right?) Mark “Mr. Marcus” Major August 12, 2016 at 6:08 pm I've been interested in one of these routers from it's release but I notice that they aren't dual band, as streaming is more popular nowadays I'm just wondering if it would be any better than your "normal" single band router, seeing as how the streaming devices (smart tv's, Fire TV's, Roku, etc) could exclusively use the 5g band, or does it make a difference?... Reply John Hayden August 13, 2016 at 10:12 am Read point number 5 in this article. Reply James Frew August 13, 2016 at 9:53 pm As John said I touched on this in #5. Also it appears to the user as a single band router, it actually uses 2.4 and 5GHz, but makes all the decisions internally so you don't have to worry about it.

Follow TechnoBuffalo Google has continuously denied any plans to merge its Android and Chrome OS software, but the search giant could be working on a new operating system that does just that. The company appears to be developing on an original OS called Fuchsia that may run on mobile and desktop devices. References to Fuchsia were recently spotted by Phoronix, a Linux-focused blog. It appears on Google’s Git repositories where it’s describes using the equation, “Pink + Purple == Fuschia (a new Operating System).” Google is apparently building the OS from scratch. It’s using the Magenta kernel for smartphones and computers, along with the LK kernel for “small systems.” That’s not a lot to go on, but it’s still pretty interesting. If Google really is working on a new operating system it could potentially combine mobile and desktop hardware under one roof. The company already seems to be moving in that direction as it continues to blur the lines between Android and Chrome OS. The two operating systems may never fully merge into one, but perhaps we’ll get a totally new third option instead.

Google, also facing antitrust investigations elsewhere in Europe, favored its own and its partners' apps in the "priority positions on the home page" of devices the Android operating system, creating a disadvantage for other apps, Russia's Federation Antimonopoly Service said Thursday. The ruling will provide "an opportunity for the development of competition in the mobile software market in Russia, which will benefit our customers," the agency said in a statement. In September, the Federation Antimonopoly Service found that Google had abused its market dominance with Android, in a ruling setting up the fine. The antitrust authority opened the case in February 2015 following a complaint from Russian search engine Yandex, which also develops mobile apps and runs its own Android app store. A Google spokesman didn't immediately respond to a request for a comment on the Russian fine. The fine represents a tiny percentage of Google's revenue, which totaled $74.5 billion in 2015. Nevertheless, the company has faced a handful other antitrust probes in Europe and elsewhere, including an Android complaint filed by the European Commission in April.

Russian antitrust officials fined Google $6.8 million for abusing its dominant market position by bundlings its apps with Android OS. "We have received notice of the fine from [Russia's Federal Antimonopoly Service] and will analyze closely before deciding our next steps," a Google spokesman told PCMag. "In the meantime, we continue to talk to all invested parties to help consumers, device manufacturers, and developers thrive on Android in Russia." The $6.8 million penalty—the latest in a growing list of global amends Google owes—is "relatively small," according to The New York Times. In comparison, the EU in May slapped Google with a $3.4 billion levy for abusing its position in the search market. The latest fine comes after Russian officials in September found Google guilty of violating the country's antimonopoly law by favoring its own services over rivals like Yandex. The Russian search engine early last year filed a complaint, accusing Google of thwarting competition. Yandex argued that user-centric services like search, maps, and email should be unbundled from the mobile OS, leveling the playing field and allowing developers to expand their audiences. FAS agreed, issuing a full ruling on the case. "We are confident that [this move will] provide an opportunity for the development of competition in the mobile software market in Russia, which will benefit our customers," Elena Zaeva, head of FAS Department of Regulation of Telecommunications and Information Technology, said in a statement. "Competition law must be observed [by] all the companies whose products are supplied to the Russian Federation—[including] multinational corporations." Three Russian smartphone vendors—Prestigio, Fly, and Explay—in 2014 were blocked from adding Yandex services to their Android gadgets. //Related Articles More EU Antitrust Headaches for Google Google, of course, would prefer that partners pre-load its own apps, but they are not required to. Nokia's 2013 Android-based X lineup, for example, was based on the customizable Android Open Source Platform (AOSP); the operating system on those phones did not come preloaded with Google Play. But it's basically an all-or-nothing proposition. Either you go with AOSP and launch with no Google services, or choose Google and bundle all the apps its requires. You can't mix and match for a phone with Google Maps but Yandex search pre-installed, for example. The European Commission, meanwhile, in April formally filed charges against Google for anti-competitive behavior related to its Android operating system.

As technology steams forward, the idea of going back to the old days of dial-up and outdated equipment is unthinkable to most of us. Unfortunately in rural areas of Cumbria this is the reality for some. Elsewhere, broadband woes have given rise to all sorts of myths about why we’re doomed to suffer from poor connectivity. We’ve teamed up with Solway Communications to bust the myths and find out how you can really improve your online experience. 1. You can’t get good internet outside Carlisle city centre Rural areas across the county have often struggled to get decent internet speeds, usually as a result of being far from the phone exchange. However there’s a way you can break away from the Openreach system - which delivers internet via phone lines - and get internet by different means instead. Across Carlisle and its surrounding area, Solway Communications offers microwave broadband, which beams high speed internet into your house via a wireless mast. As a result you can much faster and consistent speeds for both uploading and downloading. LonsdaleNet also provides a microwave service in Penrith, while some national companies offer a similar - though slightly slower - service, using satellites instead of masts. 2. If you type Google into Google you’ll break the internet This is a classic warning, but a myth nonetheless. While typing "Google" into Google will not break the internet (we promise!), you can still have some fun with the search engine. On a computer, try searching "do a barrel roll”, “askew” or “zerg rush” to see what we mean. 3. Bad weather means bad connection Sometimes it seems like as soon as the rain arrives, your internet connection vanishes. However in most cases the weather isn’t having a direct effect, the real problem is that so many people are staying indoors trying to get online at once! The more people you share a cable with who are accessing the internet, the more your speeds will suffer. Again, microwave and satellite connections are unaffected by this as they beam directly to the user. 4. Microwave internet is too expensive While microwave internet offered by businesses like Solway Communications might seem expensive, you don’t have to deal with the extras which drive up the price of a bog standard broadband connection. You’re not tied to line rental, and the reliability of the connections means you’ll waste a lot less time - whether you use the internet for business or for leisure. There are also schemes to help you get set up, including the Basic Broadband Subsidy Scheme , available to those which Connecting Cumbria determines will not get more than 2Mb/s download on the Openreach Network. 5. My computer doesn’t affect my internet speed While the speed of your computer does not affect the potential speed of your internet connection, it will massively slow down the time pages take to load. Your computer’s processor, RAM and hard disk drive will all have an impact on how quickly you can access websites, and how many internet pages you can view at one time. Older laptops may also have less sophisticated Wi-Fi antennae, which can struggle to pick up weaker Wi-Fi signals. To try and make the most of your internet connection, Nicholas Kittoe from Solway Communications says: “Remember to turn off all of the devices you don’t need at the moment – anything actively connected to the internet will use up bandwidth, including services such as Steam and Netflix. “If the Wi-Fi works in one room but not elsewhere in the house, remember that thick walls or foil insulation can block a Wi-Fi signal. In this case consider power-line extenders. “Of course you can always go for the old trick of turning it off and on again - it really can help! “However for real reliability consider making the switch to us at Solway Communications, or other local internet services providers” You can visit Solway Communications website and find out more about their internet services here: solwaycomms.com 12 August 2016 12:00PM View comments Comment on this article Email: First name: Last name: Location: Comment: Please enter the code: Generate a new code Comments not OK?

CDT August 12, 2016 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST San Antonio is one of few cities in America to be on the list for the world’s fastest internet, but now some residents say Google Fiber is quickly leaving them thirsty. Most people take filling up a glass of water from the sink for granted. It's something Fausto Alva has recently learned to appreciate. “Yesterday was the seventh time in three weeks that I've been without water for a certain amount of time,” Alva said. “We can't use the bathroom. We can't do any washing dishes. We can't drink any water. Good thing we have bottled water.” Alva said that it's gone from four to nine hours at a time. The long-time residents of El Monte Boulevard also say that the problem started about three weeks ago, just after Alva and his neighbors received notifications from Google. The company started laying down state-of-the-art, fiber-optic cables for that super-fast internet. In a statement, Google didn’t specify how it is responsible for interruption of water service. The statement read, in part: “As we build thousands of miles of fiber throughout San Antonio, we do everything we can to be good neighbors. We communicate with residents and work closely with our contractors to minimize any disruption, including notifying residents before work begins and completing restoration efforts in the area when work is complete. As always, we want to hear feedback from residents in San Antonio so that we can continue to improve and resolve any issues quickly and efficiently.” Residents KENS 5 that the only notification they’ve received was from San Antonio Water System or SAWS. This week, SAWS dried out the neighborhood for a few hours as it works to replace old water valves in the area. SAWS admitted that the work has caused low water pressure and outages. Adding to the watery mess: On Monday, there was a water main break at a nearby golf course. SAWS said that it wasn’t responsible for that, but added that the incident affected water pressure in the area. SAWS says that it will make sure its workers are notifying people about water loss ahead of time, like they're supposed to. But they’re also asking residents to make sure that their updated telephone numbers are on record so that SAWS can let them know when water will be turned off.

All I discovered was that the Google Brain team doesn't want to talk about RankBrain. Besides for the generic mentions that their team did work on search and it was called RankBrain, I found these two other remarks: From Jeff Dean at Google who said we don't talk about RankBrain and search: That being said, there are some kinds of research work where we don't necessarily publish details of our work (our work on machine learning for our search ranking system and our advertising systems, for example). From Greg Corrado at Google who said he worked on RankBrain, which was a way they used machine learning in a practical way: One of the things I really like about working at Google is that there's flexibility to work on a mix of pure research ideas and real-world applied projects. For example, I got to collaborate on a project to called DeViSE, which aimed at learning to identify a photo of an object based only on reading a wikipedia article about that object (totally nutty research)... and then collaborate on a project called RankBrain to improve the quality of Google Search results (totally practical). I feel like moving back and forth between research and products infuses us with creativity and energy. That is really it, unless I missed something. You can scan through the comments yourself on Reddit. I honestly felt we would hear more about this but I guess I was wrong. Forum discussion at Reddit. Prev Story Next story Tweet This Previous story: Google Adds JSON-LD Breadcrumbs Support   Comments: JimmySpindle 08/12/2016 11:48 am You'd think that an AMA with Google employees would be big news, but I guess their answers were too vague. I'll still read through it, though! The Truth 08/12/2016 12:12 pm AMA, about anything other than RankBrian. Google must have the most intimidating NDAA in the world. Even the North Korean Government is like "Damn, even we wouldn't go that far." Michael Martinez 08/12/2016 02:40 pm Yeah, because they know that Rankbrain is a crock of shit and designed purely to rip off webmasters by sending poor quality traffic. It's only when it gets taken offline that we see great results/conversions happen, because they're "teaching" their shitty program to make as much money as possible, not provide the best user experience. Fucking greedy cunts! josh bachynski (SEO) 08/12/2016 03:01 pm "project called RankBrain to improve the quality of Google Search results (totally practical)" As I have been saying, RankBrain is the internal guts of this new Panda (their "quality" algo), which determines a relative QualityScore (ala the 2012 panda patent) based on user clicks from the SERP to the web page target in question. They compile this data over months (up to 6 in some spaces, according to John Mueller - it varies depending on the traffic), and then push out an adjustment. It is the 3rd largest ranking factor (as they admitted in Forbes). I suspect it will be the second biggest by next year. No one (except people in the SEO space who sell links - including news media) is making links anymore. Over 50% of google's search traffic is mobile. Generally, you don't make links or edit html on mobile. You *do* share things on social, or bookmark/favorite them in your browser... And so, dofollow blog style links cannot continue to be a reliable signal, as compared to social, or just where people are clicking, which is a direct metric of relevance, as opposed to social and links which has always been a secondary signal at best. This means you need to change your design, change your user interface, even change your prices (theoretically) to make sure users are converting -which will just improve sales anyway. You need to terminate the search, as Maile Ohye has already been telling us, 3 years ago. Michael Martinez 08/12/2016 03:14 pm RankBrain is a short cut solution. Google likes short cut solutions because they save on resources. But I agree that all these short cuts do hurt the quality of Google's search results, which used to be much better and more accurate on many random queries (and I am not implying the ads are getting in the way). Nonetheless, I have also found that Google is doing better in some queries that have "correct" answers and I don't use the same exact query every time but I still see the answer I am looking for. I am pretty sure that is RankBrain-related. NewWorldDisorder 08/13/2016 12:47 pm "That being said, there are some kinds of research work where we don't necessarily publish details of our work (our work on machine learning for our search ranking system and our advertising systems, for example)." They won't talk about it because it would be self-incriminating and potentially expose they are ripping people off. RankBrain is likely behind the waves of complete shit Adwords traffic everyone is complaining about and should be investigated by regulators as it has broad economic consequences. blog comments powered by Disqus The pulse of the search community Subscribe Subscribe options ADVERTISERS Search buzz Video 11/18/2016 09:35 am Subscribe More videos Video Details Browse by: Browse by Date Find by Category Discover by Author Scan Most Recent See Comments View Tag Cloud SEM FORUM THREADS WebmasterWorld Forums E.U.

A typical question and we know Google doesn't show rich snippets for many sites because it doesn't reach a quality threshold. But one additional question was added, that he thought that maybe his XML sitemap file being broken was the culprit. But John Mueller said that is not the case, at the 3:32 mark John said that although Sitemap files are great for finding new and updated content, once Google finds it, it doesn't help with showing up for rich snippets. John said: Obviously everyone wants to have great sitemaps and they're definitely useful for us for crawling new and updated content. But if we're already crawling and indexing your content and just not showing it the way that you'd like then the sitemap file isn’t going to be the one that's that's the reason for it.

Factory Reset Protection in Samsung Smartphones Can Be Bypassed GO Rootjunky has posted a video with the method on YouTube Aug 12, 2016 14:42 GMT  ·  By Alexandra Vaidos  ·  Share:  Rootjunky has posted a video on YouTube showing everyone how they can bypass Factory Reset Protection in Samsung smartphones, more specifically, the Galaxy S6 line, the S7 range, Galaxy Note 5, and even the newly released Galaxy Note 7. Google introduced Factory Reset Protection with Android 5.0 Lollipop, and it's basically a feature that can prevent the phone from being factory-reset without entering the old password and username. In case of theft or loss, the handset and all the information stored on it will be protected, as the device won't boot without the aforementioned username and password. However, it seems that Rootjunky has found a way to bypass Google's security feature on multiple devices, the latest Samsung Galaxy smartphones, to be more precise. There are many steps that the user must take in order to bypass FRP, but the video shows that the method is quite successful. The method involved multiple steps in order to bypass FRP successfully The feature must be enabled on the device, and the user would need to connect the smartphone to a Wi-Fi network, tether the device to a computer, install a software program and fake a call to the phone. The next step involves creating a contact and opting to scan a business card. Users then need to install a file manager from the Galaxy Apps store and then a special app that Rootjunky created and that serves as a shortcut to the Google sign in screen. They then have to create a new account and reboot the device. Quite the complicated and time-consuming method, but as the video proves, it works. The method simply demonstrates that FRP isn't infallible, and Google and Samsung will most likely patch the method soon in order to protect users. Rootjunky has also bypassed FRP protection on a number of other phones like LG Stylo 2, LG G5, LG G4, Nexus 6 with Android N Preview and Nexus 6P.

Except, then he told a rally in Erie, PA, this afternoon: “But not that sarcastic, to be honest with you.” Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine released their tax returns, showing that Hillary and Bill took home nearly $11m in 2015, and paid a total of 43.2% tax. Kaine and his wife Anne Holton had an adjusted gross income of $313,441, and paid a total of 25.6% in tax. The Clinton campaign used the tax return release to push against Trump for refusing to release his while his organization is audited. Trump opened a field office in Orlando, Florida, directly across the road from the Pulse nightclub, the scene of a mass shooting that killed 49, mainly gay people of color, in June. The Guardian returned to its secret Trump voters from earlier in the year, to see if the outrageous things Trump says changes the minds of people who planned to vote for him. And, turns out, it does! Four of the ten are no longer Team Trump. Just to take us off for the weekend, Libertarian nominee Gary Johnson is talking about his experiences with marijuana edibles - not something you’re likely to hear from either Team Trump or Clinton.

Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 5.17pm EDT 17:17 Corey Lewandowski joins the paid speech circuit Donald Trump’s ex-campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, has signed to a speaker’s bureau as an insider who can reveal “behind the scenes” secrets from the campaign. The former campaign manager, who was charged with battery for allegedly grabbing a reporter, signed a confidentiality agreement as part of his employment with Trump, and it’s unknown what effect that will have on the content of his speeches, notes Politico, who first broke the news of Lewandowski’s new speech career. Lewandowski was fired from Team Trump in late June, and Donald Trump Jnr later accused Lewandowski of attempting to sabotage the campaign. He’s also getting work as a CNN commentator. His profile on the Leading Authorities website proclaims: What did the Trump and Sanders campaigns see that no one else saw? Why was no one able to predict Trump’s eventual nomination? What do businesses and associations need to know as we head into 2017? Audiences will appreciate Lewandowski’s insights into polling, demographics, historic rallies, and the energy that drove Trump to become the unexpected nominee, plus what all this means for future candidates and elections. If you’re interested in going behind the scenes of this year’s race, there is no one better positioned to discuss Trump’s runaway success than Corey Lewandowski. Whether paired with a Democratic colleague or by himself, audiences will enjoy getting an insider’s perspective on this unprecedented election. There’s no advertised price for a Lewandowski speech, although it’s probably less than the $250,000 per speech that Hillary Clinton received for speaking to Goldman Sachs.

Bloomberg describes the new office, one of 24 being open in coming weeks. Florida is a key swing state: The Orlando field office, which will officially open Monday, is tucked inside a tax preparer’s storefront, sandwiched between a tattoo parlor and a cell phone accessory shop. It was unoccupied and locked Friday, but posters are taped to the front windows, chairs are neatly arranged, and packages of bottled water and snack chips, still wrapped in plastic, wait on a side table. From the front door, one can see the steady stream of mourners who still visit Pulse throughout the day and night. The dark building is surrounded by chain-link fence and a privacy screen that’s now covered with rainbow flags and homemade signs of sympathy and remembrance. Candles and flowers are arranged on the sidewalk. The morning after the shooting, Trump tweeted that his thanks for being congratulated about Islamic terrorism (the shooter Omar Mateen was Muslim, but - as it came out in days after the shooting - also seemed to be struggling with his own sexuality). Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) Appreciate the congrats for being right on radical Islamic terrorism, I don't want congrats, I want toughness & vigilance. We must be smart! June 12, 2016 Trump regularly references the Orlando shooting, which is the nation’s worst mass shooting in history, during his rally speeches, saying if more people had guns they would have been able to stop the shooter. “If some of those wonderful people had guns strapped right here, right to their waist or right to their ankle and this son of a bitch comes out and starts shooting and one of the people in that room happened to have [a gun] and goes ‘boom, boom.’ You know what, that would have been a beautiful, beautiful sight, folks,” he said in the days following the shooting. He later clarified that he meant for guards and security guards to be armed, not club goers.

Users can now more easily find information on the Olympics in search, including details on event schedules, athletes, and medal counts, and can sign up for automatic alerts through the Google app for iOS and Android. You can also watch event highlights from select broadcasters in more than 60 countries on YouTube, along with mobile live streams from 15 YouTube Creators who have been chosen to cover the games. Google Street View now features highlights and landmarks across Rio as well, including both tourist destinations and Olympic venues. Google regularly announces features and services tailored to major events. Recently, the company came out with new search tools to help people register to vote in the 2016 US presidential election. Brands are diving into Olympics like never before With the Rio Olympics already outperforming the 2012 London Games in terms of sponsorships, expect a lot more advertising online and on your TV sets in the coming weeks — even if the video you’re watching doesn’t look like advertising at first. Take, for instance, NBC’s hour-long documentary “Kerri Walsh Jennings: Gold Within,” which follows the three-time U.S. Olympic beach volleyball gold medalist as she trains to win a fourth consecutive gold in Rio. The show, aired as a lead-up to the Olympics, was produced by Tribeca Studios, a content arm associated with the Tribeca Film Festival, on behalf of Dick’s Sporting Goods. Most viewers wouldn’t be able to tell that the documentary was made on behalf of Dick’s Sporting Goods, which received a “produced by” credit on the project but doesn’t appear within the film itself. Four other films produced by Tribeca Studios for Dick’s Sporting Goods and United Airlines follow a similarly minimalist approach. The aspiring Olympians profiled in the three short films airing on ESPN and ESPN2 are Dick’s Sporting Goods store employees, which means there are a couple of scenes filmed while they are at work. Tribeca’s “Destination: Team USA” documentary for United Airlines includes a scene where one of the athletes is traveling and checks in at a United gate. Jennings and other athletes featured in these documentaries are sponsored by Dick’s Sporting Goods, which isn’t an official Olympic sponsor. (Dick’s and United Airlines are Team USA sponsors.) Whereas before only official Olympic and team sponsors could run campaigns tied to the games, other advertisers are now able to join in the fun as long as they follow a list of rules set by the IOC. And advertisers are not only playing ball but also getting more creative. Yogurt giant Chobani, for instance, is also running documentary-style videos and TV commercials featuring athletes like Alex Morgan and Melissa Stockwell. As part of its “Stand for Progress” campaign, Citi is rolling out content across TV, YouTube, Vine, Instagram and other social platforms. Email tips to make your marketing hit the mark Marketers should always use email marketing to stay connected with their target audience. Regardless of the different strategies available today, you’ll find email marketing to be integral to your marketing campaign. This is still the leading channel for getting the best ROI. But email marketing is not a silver bullet. If your email marketing efforts aren’t effective, perhaps it’s because you aren’t doing the right things. You have to think about your strategy and use customer behaviors to turn it around. Here are tips on how to do it, according to a Forbes CMO study: 1. Stop Treating Your Customers Like Nameless Faces What a lot of marketers fail to grasp is that customers don’t want to be seen as a nameless face. They want to be acknowledged as unique human beings. This is relatively easy to do because all you have to do is indulge in some personalization. Rather than sending out the same emails to everyone, use the feedback you’re getting to segment your email list. That way you can make sure customers feel like you’re reading their minds. 2. Change The Sales Funnel Based On The Customer’s Journey The customer journey is becoming more important within the field of marketing. Mapping out the customer journey is about charting the various touch points you’ll come up against. The way customers behave will tell you what content they are looking for. Combine this with demographical information to customize the sales funnel based on the type of customer you have. 3. Optimize And Retest You should always be optimizing and retesting your various email campaigns. A/B testing campaigns are easily run from your mailing list provider. You can harvest detailed stats and begin to refine your future campaigns. 4. Give Your Customers Space It’s true that your customers do want to hear from you. The fact you have a regular email marketing campaign is one of the magic elements boosting your ROI. But there’s such a thing as overkill. Once you come off a great campaign it’s tempting to run the same campaign again in an attempt to get the same results. The chances are you’re going to get diminishing returns. Define a schedule, based on the feedback you’re getting from customers, and stick to that schedule. If you promise your customers they’ll only receive a weekly email don’t send them more than one email per week. Your welcome email can also come with a form to help customers decide how often they want to be contacted. 5. Don’t Rely On Automation Email automation is an essential ingredient of every great email campaign. But this doesn’t mean you should rely on it. You should be using it to eliminate the tedious processes that come with crafting an email marketing campaign. It shouldn’t be replacing you in general. 6. Solve The ‘Opt Out’ Problem With A Break Did you know that 54 percent of the average person’s inbox is taken up by promotional emails? It’s no surprise to see people opting out of mailing lists faster than ever before. They’re becoming more discerning because they’re tired of so many low-quality mailing lists. Marketers that have this same problem can alleviate it through implementing a break. Opting down is a better option than giving people the chance to stay or go. For example, you can add a form that allows people to reduce how often they receive your emails. You can still retain your customers without bothering them. It’s the best compromise. 7. Get Ready For Mobile What companies are learning is that people access the Internet exclusively through mobile devices. All your emails should be optimized for mobile. No matter the device it should automatically adjust itself to fit their screen. Luckily, optimizing for mobile is easier than ever before. The majority of emailing list providers automatically provides you with optimized mailing campaigns. Tarnished Mic | Trump’s brand of politics is backfiring By any branding measure, Donald Trump just blundered through the worst week of any presidential candidate in living memory. Showing a characteristic refusal to back down from a fight, Trump took the almost unthinkable step of publicly escalating a feud with the parents of fallen US solider, Capt. Humayun Khan, who blasted Trump at the Democratic convention as unfit for the presidency. And in an interview with ABC’s George Stephanopoulos, Trump said Russian President Vladimir Putin wouldn’t make a military move into Ukraine – even though Putin has already done that by seizing the Crimean Peninsula in 2014. In any normal political campaign, these stumbles would hobble Trump’s ability to pass the fabled commander in chief test, in which Americans take their measure of a candidate and decide whether he is fit to lead them. But no one needs reminding that 2016 is not a conventional political year. Then he refused to endorse Arizona Sen. John McCain, and dragged his feet on endorsing House Speaker Paul Ryan. Did Trump go too far? Trump’s previous feuds and torching of political correctness have not doomed him. In some cases, his behavior has lifted him among voters who believe something elemental about their nation is being taken away and who want a candidate who will blow the political system – and political correctness – to smithereens. But these continued missteps could start to punch holes in the USS Donald – and has certainly badly stained his brand in the court of public opinion. Each week, The Spin Cycle will bestow a Golden Mic Award to the person, group or company in the court of public opinion that best exemplifies the tenets of solid PR, marketing and advertising – and those who don’t.

Resend activation e-mail Law & Disorder / Civilization & Discontents Russia fines Google $6.75 million for Android antitrust violations Google ordered to loosen restrictions on Android device makers after Yandex complaint. by Jennifer Baker (UK) - Aug 12, 2016 1:58 pm UTC Login to bookmark 95 Google has been fined more than £5 million (438 million rubles, $6.8 million) and told to slacken limits it places on device makers by Russian authorities who found that the search and ad giant had breached competition rules with its Android mobile operating system. On Thursday, the country's Federation Anti-monopoly Service (FAS) said that Google forced mobile phone manufacturers to include Google search on the home screen of all Android devices and bundling other services with Google Play, while preventing manufacturers from pre-installing competing services. The case was opened in February 2014, when one of those rivals, Yandex, filed an official complaint against Google. Last year, the authorities decided that it had broken Russian competition law. The ruling was upheld again in March, when Google lost an appeal. FAS said in a statement that Russian law applies to all companies operating in the country. The fine—standing at almost £5.25 million—is small change compared to the Internet behemoth’s $74.5 billion global annual turnover. Russian authorities may only fine up to 15 percent of domestic earnings. “We have received notice of the fine from FAS and will analyse it closely before deciding our next steps. In the meantime, we continue to talk to all invested parties to help consumers, device manufacturers and developers thrive on Android in Russia,” said Google's press office. Google faces similar antitrust charges in the European Union, where potential penalties are more severe. In April, competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager sent a Statement of Objections to the company saying Google had abused its dominant position by imposing restrictions on Android device makers and ordering it to clean up its act or face a fine of up to 10 percent of its annual turnover. While Russia's fine against Google is tiny, an order from the FAS demanding that the ad giant change the restrictions it places on device makers in the country could prove to be more damaging. Google is appealing against the order, with a hearing scheduled for August 16. This story was updated after publication with comment from Google.

On its Google Blog, Anthony Laforge, Flash curator for Chrome, said that more than 90 percent of web loads run Flash behind the scenes, running functions such as page analytics and essentially leaves the user more vulnerable to security threats. Switch to HTML5 As such, the popular web browser is making the switch to HTML5, which promises faster loading time, more efficient power consumption, as well as reduced page loads. Chrome 53 will begin blocking background Flash on all websites, save for pages that run 100 percent Flash. Yes, I want Breaking Christian News Submit On December, Chrome 55 will have HTML5 as the default experience, which will allow for safer and faster browsing. Why should this be good news for everyone? For starters, the 20-year-old software's ability to run complicated scripts is the very same thing that attackers exploit and abuse for malicious purposes. In a Yahoo! report, Chase Cunningham of the security company FireHost explained that Flash can directly access computer memory, thus inviting security threats. Beyond this, Flash uses increased computing time, which bogs down the entire system. Other websites ditching Adobe Chrome is not the only browser to ditch the Adobe software over security concerns. In July, Mozilla Firefox also blocked the use of Flash on its pages. Meanwhile, Alex Stamos, chief security officer on social media giant Facebook, had even called on Adobe to set an end-of-life date for Flash in order to give time for other softwares to disentangle its dependencies on the platform. What makes HTML5 a viable alternative, however, is its ability to access content easily. It has audio and video support, and promises cleaner and more elegant codes to allow web designers to assess a site's structure easily. Moreover, HTML5 allows easier cross-pollination of old, cached sites to your modern, updated browsers.

The new Note runs Android 6.0 Marshmallow out of the box, rather than Google’s latest Android version. Even if it wanted to, Samsung could not have released the Galaxy Note 7 with Android 7.0 on board because Google is yet to launch the final version of Nougat. However, a new report says Samsung’s latest phone might get the update by November. DON’T MISS: New leaked photos show the iPhone 7 Plus in Space Black Google should release Android 7.0 at some point this month, with LG already claiming to be the first company to launch a non-Nexus device running Nougat out of the box. Talking to reporters at the Galaxy Note 7 launch in South Korea, Samsung confirmed that China would get a better phablet version than anyone else, one that packs 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. But The Korea Times reports that Samsung Mobile’s chief Koh Dong-jin also let it slip that the Android 7.0 update should hit the new Note in the coming two to three months. “It is very important for us to offer up-to-date information with the new OS, but what’s more crucial is to build a stable and seamless platform for users,” Koh said. “That’s why we are planning to do enough beta testing before any OS updates.” Samsung isn’t known for launching speedy Android updates, so things may still change by November. But it’s more than likely that the Galaxy Note 7 and the Galaxy S7 will be the first Samsung gadgets to get Google’s Nougat.

What exactly are the anticompetitive practices Google was found to be engaging in? Pre-installing apps on its mobile OS Android, which is by far the most popular smartphone platform in Russia. Yeah... DON'T MISS: One of Apple’s biggest wholesale partners is already taking iPhone 7 preorders Google includes a number of its own apps in Android and it requires its vendor partners to include many of those apps on their phones if they want access to the Google Play store. The reasons for this are twofold: First, it means putting Google's products and services in front of more eyeballs. Second, it ensures that Android devices provide a certain level of user experience that lower quality apps might not provide. Vendors can of course do practically whatever they want with Android, including stripping out all of Google's apps and using alternative app stores like the Amazon Appstore. That option is apparently not enough for Yandex, the Russian search leader that initially filed the antitrust complaint that ultimately led to this fine. Yandex holds 60% of the Russian search market, but that share is shrinking as Google makes gains — thanks largely to Android and the ongoing shift from desktop to mobile computing. The fine, which was levied on Thursday by Russia's Federal Antimonopoly Service, amounts to just under $7 million. Considering Google took in $4.8 billion in profits last quarter alone, the company likely won't have much difficulty coming up with the cash.

A few days ago, Google was reportedly testing a new feature called 'Explore Interests' in Google Now to get regular updates on selected categories and key interests. Now, the tech giant is testing new Dashboard tab at the bottom to show all important emails, events and photographs in one section.Specifically, the new Dashboard Tab will open a new page where all information from various Google apps and services will be collated and kept for the user to browse. This could mean important emails that need your attention, special photos from Google Assistant, reminders, to-do lists, and important events from calendars. For now, this tab only appears for select users with the Google Now Launcher that was leaked last week. The leak gave away this new feature which was supposed to still be in its testing phase. There are no clear details on what the Dashboard tab will feature and how it will work. There is also no official word on when (and if) Google plans to release this feature commercially. There is also noise that the new Launcher will only be exclusive to Nexus devices, and won't be seen on other devices. To the few users who do have it for now, have reported bugs and claim that the tab doesn't function properly. But mind you it's just in its testing phase and Google doesn't want you to use it currently anyway. The tab appears at the bottom with the option to return back to the homepage. Google is anticipated to release Android 7.0 Nougat soon, where more clarity on the matter will be obtained. Tags: Android, Apps, Dashboard Tab, Explore Interest, Google, Google Now, Google services.

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Google Now ‘Dashboard’ tab seen, could be a beta feature By R Padla - August 12, 2016 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter Google Now is getting some significant changes. Aside from adding Explore Interests to bring more relevant cards and the improved weather card, Google Now is being updated with a new ‘Dashboard’ tab where ‘Home’ is also placed. Perhaps as preparation for the Google Assistant, the company is making several changes to Google Now to ensure everything will go smoothly. This ‘Dashboard’ section is new but there’s not much information about because it’s not yet working. The tab is just there but only visible with the Nexus Launcher. It seems the feature collects data from from different Google services and shows them all in one place–this Dashboard. We’re guessing almost all quick data on events, calendar, to-do lists, emails, or photos will be listed there. Details are scarce so we can surmise that it’s only a test. This could also be related to the Nexus Launcher which was recently leaked. We can share with you a lot of our assumptions about this Dashboard but they will only remain as such. Let’s wait and see what this new section is all about and how Google intends to utilize it with the Google Now, Google Assistant, or the Nexus Launcher.

Pale Moon to Remove Google Search from Their Product After Policy Violation Spat GO Angry Pale Moon dev decides to remove any trace of Google Search from his product following confusing Google reply Aug 12, 2016 12:50 GMT  ·  By Catalin Cimpanu  ·  Share:  Pale Moon's lead developer announced yesterday that the browser would remove any trace of Google Search following Google's decision not to reward the project for the search traffic the browser is sending their way. First signs that something was wrong in the Pale Moon - Google collaboration came on August 8, when Moonchild, the Pale Moon project's founder, published an announcement that included, among other things, the following paragraph: “  As you may know, the search engine traffic on that start page is a big portion of what gives me the income to make Pale Moon work at no cost to its users. Unfortunately Google has been pretty much cutting me off with claiming it is 'invalid traffic' and that it would be a policy violation just because the browser is downloadable software - this is nonsense, because the web page the search traffic comes from is a normal, public web page like we've run since day one, and search traffic from the search bar or about:home pages is not monetized at all through Google's program (meaning 100% of that revenue goes to Google if used). With Google trying to pull a 'we'll take your traffic but won't pay for it' on me (still pending a clear answer from them), it's high time to switch this over to our more reliable search partner DuckDuckGo.  ” Following this announcement, the Pale Moon browser, a fork of the Firefox browser but with a focus on privacy and still supporting the XUL interface, released an update. This update switched from using Google Search to DuckDuckGo as the default search provider across the whole browser. Three days later, as the Google reply Moonchild mentioned came in, things appeared to have taken a turn for the worse. “  Despite the general popularity of Google Search as an option in Pale Moon, we have been forced to make a hard decision to remove Google Search completely from anything in Pale Moon. As a follow-up to the problems indicated in our previous announcement, Google's "Ad Traffic Quality Team" has decided to interpret their policies that are geared to preventing toolbars and external programs from changing user settings for home pages and similar as "you may not have a Google Search box on the default home page", basically trying to determine for us what our out-of-the-box-experience (OOBE) should be. In lieu of giving Google control over our design choices, we are removing Google Search as an option entirely, both from the start page and from within the browser.  ” Moonchild is now working on a Pale Moon version that will remove Google Search completely from its browser. Google's decision does not make sense The entire situation is a little ironic and moronic at the same time since Google's ad policy is aimed to prevent abusive behavior from plugins and toolbars that hijack the user's browsing experience by inserting the Google search box in other pages or products. Clearly, the Pale Moon is not a malicious product and is not being forced upon users in any other way. A developer should have the ability to decide the default settings in their own product, and take advantage of Google's search revenue making system at the same time. Furthermore, Pale Moon is based on Firefox, a browser that was kept alive all these years thanks to its Google Search integration. Pale Moon users who still want to use Google for their searches from Pale Moon need to visit the google.com service, install a browser plugin, or use DuckDuckGo (new default search provider) by adding "!g" to all searches.

The country’s anti-monopoly regulator has fined the internet giant for $6.75 million over the requirement that manufacturers of Android-powered devices pre-install Google’s own apps. The Russian Federation Antimonopoly Service (FAS)’s investigation was triggered after Yandex, the country’s largest search engine, filed a complaint last year that Google was abusing its power and being anti-competitive. It turns out that Yandex is actually a strong competitor for Google in Russia, as it currently dominates 60% of the nation’s search engine market. However, with web search traffic migrating to mobile devices, and the fact that Android runs on most smartphones and tablets sold in the country, means that Yandex is worried about being left behind. The other main issue here is that the requirement for manufacturers to pre-install Google apps revolves around getting access to Google Play Services, like the Play Store. Yandex wants central placement on smartphones, which is something they could get with a customized, open-source version of Android, just like plenty of other manufacturers around the world do. But if they do that, they won’t get access to Google’s ecosystem. “To restore competition on the market, Google should amend agreements with mobile-device producers within a month and exclude the anti-competitive clauses,” the FAS has stated. Google has already filed an appeal to the fine, with a hearing scheduled for August 16th. As for the fine amount, $6.75 million is a drop in the ocean for Google, but is based on Russia’s regulations that it be 15% of the company’s revenue within the country from the year 2014.

With a new drone with a projector, this will soon be possible. US tech giant Google has been granted a patent by the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) for an "unmanned aerial vehicle for collaboration" called mobile telepresence system. The objective of a telepresence system is to present interactive video and audio between users in geographically-dispersed locations. "Many drones come with cameras but Google thinks a drone with a projector could be the answer to mobile telepresence conferencing," technology website zdnet.com reported on Friday. Google thinks that its unmanned drone could provide significant improvements in speed, maneuverability, energy consumption and facilitate access to cramped spaces. For stability reasons, Google's quadcopter design is shaped like the letter 'H' with a propeller at the ends of each of the longer strokes, the report said. In one embodiment, a screen dangles off the front end of the drone while a projector perches at the rear of the vehicle. The display area of the screen is being described as semi-translucent so that images projected from the rear can be viewed from the front-facing surface of the screen. "The smartphone may receive images from the user at the remote location, and may project the received images through a projector included with the smartphone," the report added. The setup could use two mirrors where one bounces an image from the phone to a screen, and a second is used to capture an image from a room and reflect that to the camera of a smartphone. Telepresence systems sold by companies like HP and Cisco may offer a virtual meeting space but the right equipment needs to be at both ends usually at a fixed location, noted Google. According to Google, it can solve this with the help of drones equipped with everything that a telepresence system features, including cameras, microphones, projectors, speakers and a display. --IANS anuj/na/dg SEARCH About Us Data Center Cloud Computing Servers Cloud Applications Hosting MPLS VPN Network Services Disclaimer Privacy Policy Careers Feedback Advertise Digital © Copyright Sify Technologies Ltd, 1998-2016.

By Kedar Grandhi August 12, 2016 12:55 BST Close Embed Feed EU charges Google with abusing market dominance of Android IBTimes UK <iframe src="http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/videos/embed/18019" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe> South Korea's antitrust regulator on Friday (12 August) launched a formal enquiry on Google. The Korea Fair Trade Commission (KFTC) said the purpose of the probe was to check if Google had violated the country's anti-competition laws. However, the KFTC it failed to disclose more information on the same. It did not comment on the nature of the probe nor did it make any mention of the potential antitrust violations. It was also not clear if the probe would translate to any formal charges. Google has in the past been probed by antitrust regulators in both Brussels and WashingtonGetty Images The Financial Times citing local media reports said the investigation came after some Korean advertising agents filed complaint against Google. They had in 2014 alleged that the American internet giant had not paid them the online advertising commissions due to them, since 2012. The news came in just a few hours after local media newswire BusinessKorea, said that KFTC had acquitted Google of previous charges that it used its market dominance to set an unfair advertising policy. Local search engine companies had alleged that Google had affected their business by unfairly blocking them on smartphones and other devices that run on Google's Android operating system. The regulator, however, is said to have concluded that Google's preloaded apps and subsidies had not helped the company to gain a dominant market share in the Asian country. This was based on the fact that local players like Naver and Daum Kakao enjoyed a double-digit market share while Google had only a 2% to 8% share during the period of 2008 to March 2016. This development follows Russia fining Google $6.75m (£5.21m) on Thursday (11 August) for violating Android antitrust rules on mobile devices. The Russian Federal Antimonopoly Service (FAS) imposed the same following a complaint filed by the country's largest search engine Yandex NV in 2015. This is not the first time that California, US headquartered company is being probed by antitrust regulators. It has been probed in the past by regulators in both Brussels and Washington. The European Union too has been at loggerheads with Google over antitrust allegations for some years. The EU had earlier in 2016 filed a third antitrust charge against the internet giant alleging that it gave financial incentives to manufacturers and operators if they would exclusively pre-install Google Search on their devices.

The latest improvement was applied to the Google Maps app, which apparently features a body of code that will bring along the capability of directing a user to a parking spot. While users cannot seek a parking spot with the current version of the Google Maps mobile app, the Mountain View giant seems to be preparing itself for a time when it will be capable of this feat. The line of code was discovered by the nifty people at Android Police, who took the time to analyze the source code of Google Maps’ v9.34 app by tearing down its APK. As they explain in a disclaimer, they can only speculate on the reason why Google would place the specific lines of code discovered within the source code of the Google Maps app. With that mentioned, it appears that the source-code of the popular navigation app includes multiple lines of code that indicates "Parking Difficulty." As the print screens from the app have revealed, the developers of the app have prepared it to map certain areas depending on the difficulty of finding a parking spot in the vicinity. Three parking "levels" were classified: Easy, Medium, and Hard. The latter refers to a section where there are limited places in an area, so Google Maps might advise the user to go somewhere else to park the car. The feature is not yet live, so not even developers could feast in the benefits of Google’s advanced technology. The same update, which will be available to regular users soon, will also come with a few benefits that will be at your fingertips (pun intended). We belive the new feature could be helpful for the company's self-driving cars. The mentioned features are preventing accidental swipes, and keeping the map orientated North at all times. The second element will be available only if the user toggles it from the Settings menu of the app, while the former will also require a visit to the same section of the Google Maps application.

We’ll need more bandwidth for streaming high-definition video, strolling through virtual worlds, and, well, doing things no one has even thought of yet. But Google worries that Internet service providers won’t give us all the bandwidth we’ll need. So it’s taking matters into its own hands. Several years ago, it unveiled Google Fiber, providing ultra-high-speed Internet connections to home and businesses in certain select cities. This redefined notions of how fast our Internet speeds should be, and in some cases, it significantly increased competition among service providers. But Google has been slow to push the service into new places. And the fact of the matter is that most people are still stuck with much slower connections. So, in order to accelerate this revolution, Google is turning to wireless technologies. Today, the fastest Internet connections arrive via wire line. Your home connection is faster than the connection to your mobile phone. But Google is exploring a different breed of wireless that could provide a way of more rapidly pushing high-speed connections into homes and offices across the country. Earlier this year, officials in Kansas City approved a Google plan to place experimental wireless antennas on the city’s light poles so that the company could expand its network of Internet connections without tapping into wire lines. And a new document, first spotted by Business Insider, reveals that Google is planning to expand those experiments into other cities, including Atlanta, Georgia; Austin, Texas; and Provo, Utah. The document signals that Google is serious about delivering Internet over the 3.5GHz radio spectrum, a swath of spectrum that the FCC opened up for broadband use last year. All this is part of much larger effort to accelerate the evolution of our Internet connections. Google recently acquired an Internet service provider that was exploring similar technology, and Facebook is building new wireless antennas that can not speed up our Internet connections and even them into new places. The fiber-optic wire line pipes required to deliver Google Fiber style gigabit Internet connections are already available across much of the country. The problem is that it’s very expensive to connect those backbone pipes to people’s homes and offices—the so-called “last mile” of an Internet connection. This often involves digging up people’s yards, or even tearing up streets and sidewalks. In Kansas City, the first place Google Fiber offered its service, Google was able to cut its deployment costs by negotiating deals to run its cables along existing utility lines. But the company hasn’t had as much luck gaining access to utility poles in other cities. For example, AT&T sued to prevent Google Fiber from accessing its utility poles in Louisville, Kentucky. That could be a big part of why Google appears to be shifting its focus to wireless technologies, which, in theory, should be much cheaper to deploy and could eventually offer speeds that are competitive with fixed line fiber optic connections. Google Fiber recently delayed its plans to deploy fiber in Silicon Valley and Portland, Oregon, and is reportedly considering offering wireless Internet access instead. Meanwhile, Google recently acquired an Internet provider called WebPass. WebPass already uses wireless back haul in providing high-speed connections to apartment buildings in San Francisco. And through its partnership with a company called Artemis Networks, it could one day offer something more radical. Artemis has been working on something called pCell networks, which could improve bandwidth further still. Unlike Google, Facebook doesn’t seem interested in becoming an Internet service provider. But it’s still investing heavily in technologies that aim to improve Internet access. Earlier this year, the company unveiled an ambitious plan to build new types of antennas and other wireless technologies and give the designs away freely to telcos. This includes ARIES, which the company hopes will be used to beam Internet access into hard to reach rural areas, and Terragraph, which is designed to help improve WiFi and cellular coverage in cities. Of course, the world won’t depend entirely on wireless Internet. Both companies are heavily investing in undersea cables, and Google’s parent company Alphabet is also trenching pipe for Internet connections in Ghana. But when it comes to the last mile, both companies envision a wireless future. Go Back to Top. Skip To: Start of Article. Broadband Google Fiber Skip Social. Skip to: Latest News.

But when her bill arrived that summer, she claims, it said she owned more than $300, thanks to some equipment she never received and a Latino triple-play service that included voice service with international calling. She called customer service, but they said that they couldn’t explain how the new services were added to her bill—and that they couldn’t authorize a refund. She’d have to talk to the billing department for that. And so began a three hour stay in customer service hell that ultimately ended with her being transferred to a fax machine. This woman’s story is one of the thousands of allegations examined by the Federal Communications during its two year investigation of Comcast, and one of several cited in a settlement published by the agency on Tuesday. In the aftermath of the investigation, Comcast has agreed to pay a $2.3 million fine. That may not sound like much, but according to the FCC, it’s the largest civil penalty it has ever assessed against a cable provider. “It’s bigger than a dollar amount,” says Kate Forscey, an associate counsel for Government Affairs at the digital rights advocacy group Public Knowledge. “It’s the agency taking a stand to protect the customers who are being grifted by the cable companies. I hope this won’t’ be a one-off.” We hope so too. The investigation highlights just how hard it is for customers to get refunds for services they never should have been charged for in the first place. And the rather low fine shows how difficult it is to actually regulate these companies. Yes and No The FCC’s rules prohibit Comcast and other companies from charging customers for services they didn’t explicitly sign-up for. In other words, just because you didn’t say “no” to a service or a piece of equipment doesn’t mean your telco can charge you for it. But according the settlement, customers were in some cases charged for services and equipment they did specifically decline. Some customers even claim Comcast reported them to collection agencies while while they were disputing their bills. The situation brings to mind the recent Wells Fargo scandal, during which employees created unauthorized accounts for customers, in some cases damaging customers’ credit ratings and collecting fees for accounts the customers didn’t even know existed. But Comcast denies any intentional wrongdoing. “We do not agree with [the FCC’s] legal theory here, and in our view, after two years, it is telling that it found no problematic policy or intentional wrongdoing, but just isolated errors or customer confusion,” the company said in a statement. “We agree those issues should be fixed and are pleased to put this behind us and proceed with these customer service-enhancing changes.” They Call It Cramming Indeed, even though the FCC fielded thousands of complaints, that amounts to a small percentage of Comcast’s actual customer base. Telecommunications industry analyst Jan Dawson agrees that it appears that it these particular complaints came from a small subsection of Comcast subscribers, but points out that the practice of adding small fees to customers’ bills has been so common over the years there’s even a name for it: cramming. Ultimately, it’s not clear how common the problem actually is. “We don’t know the people who didn’t file complaints,” Forscey says. But she believes the number of complains show that these weren’t isolated incidents, rather “a fundamental operation as to how these companies are treating their consumers.” What’s more, the problem wasn’t just that customers were being billed for services they didn’t sign-up for. It was also ridiculously hard to get those fees reversed, often requiring customers to spend hours on the phone. That sort of thing is certainly in keeping with a the long history of complaints about Comcast that has led to it being ranked at the bottom of 24/7 Wall St.’s annual customer satisfaction poll for seven years in a row. Keep an Eye Out In addition to the fees, Comcast has agreed to implement a five year plan to prevent this sort of thing in the future. Under the plan, Comcast will allow customers to “lock” their accounts so new services can’t added, and will refrain from referring disputed charges to collection agencies while the dispute is still under investigation. But Dawson says we should all still be vigilant. “In any company of sufficient size you’ll always get individuals or managers who bend the rules to try to hit their targets,” he says. “So I’m sure we’ll continue to see at least some examples of this sort of thing going forward.” So keep an eye on your bill for weird fees.

For seven years in a row Comcast ranked at the bottom of 24/7 Wall St.’s annual customer satisfaction poll. Now the company’s business practices may land it in court. This week Washington state filed a $100 million lawsuit against Comcast, accusing the company of 1.8 million violations of the the state’s Consumer Protection Act. The state isn’t suing Comcast for bad customer service per se, but for the sorts of misleading claims and practices that have given Comcast such a poor public image. (Comcast denies any wrongdoing.) The state’s biggest grievance appears to be Comcast’s $4.99-per-month “Service Protection Plan,” which Washington attorney general Bob Ferguson’s office calls “near-worthless.” According to the lawsuit, Comcast promoted the plan as a single-fee program that would cover all service calls, including those that involved in-wall wiring. The catch? Any work on “wires concealed within walls requiring wall fishing” was excluded, an exception the suit says meant customers would still have to pay for most in-wall service calls. Related Stories Comcast’s Netflix Deal Could Open a New Front in Net Neutrality War Gunning for Google, Comcast Preps Gigabit Internet That Works With Regular Cable Layer3 TV’s Crazy Plan to Take on Comcast and Reinvent Cable “The plan does not, in fact, cover the vast majority of inside wiring,” the Ferguson’s announcement alleges, adding that customer service scripts given to Comcast representatives deliberately misled customers. The service’s limitations are now spelled out on the Comcast’s website, but the state claims those changes were made only recently “on the verge of this litigation.” According to the suit, Comcast not only buried the exceptions to the plan in the fine print but failed to give customers a copy of the fine print, or even tell them that the fine print exists. Comcast disputes that the plan was misleading, saying it covered more than 99 percent of customers’ repair calls. “We worked with the Attorney General’s office to address every issue they raised, and we made several improvements based on their input,” Comcast said in a statement. The company said it was disappointed the attorney general’s office had chosen to sue instead of continuing to work with Comcast. “We stand behind our products and services and will vigorously defend ourselves.” This isn’t the first time that Ferguson has gone after a telco over deceptive advertising. In 2013, the attorney general’s investigation into T-Mobile concluded that the mobile service provider’s ads promising “no contracts” mislead customers. T-Mobile settled with the state by adding disclaimers about the consequences of canceling your T-Mobile service before you’ve paid off your phone. This time around, Ferguson is looking for more than just a few disclaimers. The lawsuit seeks to have customers’ service call fees refunded and their credit scores revised. (Along with the allegedly misleading service plans, the lawsuit also claims that Comcast damaged customers’ credit scores by running unauthorized credit checks.) Maybe none of this will make your wait time faster during your next call to Comcast. But it just might make the company take a harder look at its scripts it provides its customer service reps. Bad customer service may not be a crime. But it sure feels like an injustice. Go Back to Top. Skip To: Start of Article. cable Comcast telecoms Skip Social. Skip to: Latest News.

But it might not work the same way the high-speed fiber optic Internet service does elsewhere. On Wednesday, the San Francisco-based Internet service provider Webpass announced that Google Fiber has agreed to buy the company. Webpass primarily offers what it calls “point-to-point wireless” service to businesses, apartment buildings and condos in five metropolitan areas—San Francisco, San Diego, Chicago, Boston, and Miami. What this means is that Webpass beams Internet to a fixed antenna on the building, and then runs data cables into each unit. From the end-user’s perspective, the connection is simply a traditional ethernet port like you’d find in corporate offices or dorm rooms. Webpass advertises connections as fast 1Gps–the same speed as Google Fiber—for either $550 per year or $65 per month for the 1Gbps service. Landlords can also opt to pay for the service and offer it as an amenity to residents. That’s less than Google charges for the same speed: a 1Gbps fixed-line fiber optic service goes for about $80 a month. A Google Fiber spokesperson says that Webpass’s pricing and branding will remain the same after the acquisition. The Webpass approach differs from Google’s Fiber’s usual model, which involves running fiber optic cables to customers’ homes. But earlier this year Google Fiber began testing wireless Internet service in Kansas City in an attempt to cut the costs of deploying high-speed connections. And this spring Google Fiber announced that it would offer service to select San Francisco apartments and condos, so this move seems to fit well with that strategy. “Joining Google Fiber will be a great development for our users because the companies share the same vision of the future and commitment to the customer,” Webpass president Charles Barr wrote on the Webpass blog. “Google Fiber’s resources will enable Webpass to grow faster and reach many more customers than we could as a standalone company.” Terms of the deal weren’t disclosed, but according to Barr’s post, the acquisition should close this summer. This isn’t the first time Google Fiber has acquired an existing provider. In 2013 the company acquired the Provo, Utah fiber-optic network iProvo. But it does represent a shift in the company’s overall strategy, away from building entirely new infrastructure. If Google Fiber is serious about becoming a nationwide Internet provider to rival Comcast, Verizon and Charter, more acquisitions will surely follow. Go Back to Top. Skip To: Start of Article.

Today the company announced that it will make its high-speed internet service available to San Francisco apartments, condos, and affordable housing properties where fiber optic cables are already available. The announcement echoes Monday’s news that Google Fiber will bring its service to Huntsville, Alabama, where it will license the city-owned fiber optic infrastructure and share that infrastructure with other providers. “By using existing fiber to connect some apartments and condos, as we’ve done before, we can bring service to residents more quickly,” Google Fiber director of business operations Michael Slinger said.

The service is already available in Kansas City; Austin, Texas; Provo, Utah and Atlanta, Georgia. Many other cities, including San Antonio and Nashville, have also been slated for Fiber. This isn’t the first time Google has tried to offer Internet in San Francisco, which for a tech hub can be notoriously resistant to change. In 2007, Google and Earthlink proposed a city-wide WiFi service to San Francisco that ultimately fizzled. Let’s just hope its plans for Google Fiber work out better. Go Back to Top.

The bad news: the legislation contains loopholes that could allow “Internet fast lanes”—the very preferential treatment that net neutrality is supposed to restrict. As the name suggests, the Telecoms Single Market legislation is meant to establish a single telecommunications market for all of Europe. The regulations, which have been debated for over two years, also include provisions that prohibit most roaming fees by mobile carriers and ban most forms of traffic discrimination by Internet service providers. But critics find protections for both net neutrality and against roaming fees too weak. Estelle Masse, a policy analyst for the the Internet freedom advocacy group Access Now, says that the legislation allows Internet service providers and mobile carriers not to charge for certain types of a data—a practice called “zero rating.” The organization also worries about over-broad language that would allow providers to charge varying rates for “specialized services.” The fear is that this could provide “fast lanes” and “slow lanes” for certain types of content, such as streaming video, or give companies whose data services are zero-rated an unfair advantage over others. Julia Reda, a member of the European Parliament representing the Pirate Party, argued in a statement today that even the roaming protections are too weak because they will still allow carriers to apply roaming fees if a customer exceeds certain undefined limits. Network neutrality advocates sought to close the loopholes with a pair of amendments. Today, however, European lawmakers, eager to have the regulations in place, passed the rules without the amendments. But all is not lost for network neutrality advocates. Masse notes in a blog post today that the passage of the legislation opens a nine month “consultation period” during which regulators will hammer out the new rules in more detail. That creates an opportunity to close those loopholes once and for all. Go Back to Top. Skip To: Start of Article. Access Broadband Europe european union network neutrality Skip Social.

Another city is getting a blistering 10 gigabit fiber Internet service. Say hello to Chattanooga, Tennessee. Today the Chattanooga Electric Power Board, the city-owned power utility, says that it is now offering 10 gigabit connections—nearly 1,000 faster than the average broadband connection in the US—to every business and residence in the city for about $300 a month. It will also offer three and five gigabit speed connections in addition its existing one gigabit service. Chattanooga was one of the first cities to bypass large commercial Internet service providers and start offering city-run gigabit-speed fiber services for its citizens back in 2008—about five years before Google Fiber brought comparable speeds to Kansas City. Commercial providers naturally hate these sorts of government-funded initiatives—known as municipal broadband—and have fought to pass laws to prohibit them in many states. Comcast, for example, unsuccessfully sued the Chattanooga Electric Power Board in 2008 in an attempt to block the network’s funding. But the legal tide has been turning, and commercial providers are slowly beginning to actually try to compete. Earlier this year Comcast announced that Chattanooga would be among the first cities in which it would sell its new $300-per-month two-gigabit Internet service. It’s hard to see the new 10 gigabit service as anything more than an attempt to not be outdone by Comcast. Few home users will be able to take advantage of that much bandwidth, but schools and other large organizations could see a real benefit. At the same time, there’s something bigger at work. Municipal broadband providers are raising expectations nationwide for what good Internet service means, forcing commercial providers to improve their infrastructure. And by increasing the amount of bandwidth available, they could be setting the stage for the creation of new, more bandwidth-hungry applications. This is how better service goes from a “nice-to-have” to a “you’d-better-have” for the country’s recalcitrant cable companies. Go Back to Top. Skip To: Start of Article.

Cade Metz Business Date of Publication: 08.12.16. 08.12.16 Time of Publication: 7:00 am. 7:00 am Intel Reinvents Itself to Stay King in a Changing World Tyrone Siu/REUTERS Intel is bigger than all but 50 other U.S. companies, and that’s because of something called the CPU. If you were around in the ’90s or the early aughts, you saw the TV ads. Intel Inside. For decades, Intel has supplied a majority of the chips that sit at the heart of our personal computers, including desktops as well as laptops. These chips are called central processing units, CPUs for short. They handle most all of the digital calculations that drive our PCs. They also handle most of the calculations inside the millions upon millions of computer servers that run Internet services like Google Search, Facebook, Amazon, and Twitter. And Intel came to dominate this market too. It now builds 99 percent of all CPUs that wind up in a computer server, according to research firm IDC. When you use the Internet, you use Intel. But the chip market is now shifting in new directions. And as it shifts, Intel is remaking itself in an effort to stay on top of the heap. The world’s largest chip maker somehow missed the shift away from the PC and toward the smartphone. Other chip makers supply most of the silicon at the heart of our phones. But Intel now sees that the game is changing on the Internet as well. To run their myriad online services—operations of unprecedented size and complexity—Internet giants like Google, Facebook, and Microsoft need more than just CPUs inside their millions of servers. They’re using all sorts of alternative chips to accelerate particular technologies, most notably the new breed of artificial intelligence. So, Intel is remaking itself as a company that can build these chips too. Last summer, Intel paid $16.7 billion to acquire Altera, a company whose programmable chips, known as FPGAs, help choose search results inside Bing, the Microsoft search engine. This was the largest acquisition in the history of Intel. And then, earlier this week, the company agreed to acquire Nervana, a startup building chips just for deep neural networks, AI services that can learn tasks by analyzing enormous amounts of data. At Google, Facebook, and so many others, deep neural nets are now recognizing photos, identifying spoken words, and translating from one language to another—among other tasks—and that’s why Intel paid an apparent $408 million for Nervana. “We’re now at the precipice of the next big wave of growth,” says Intel vice president Jason Waxman, “and that’s going to be driven by artificial intelligence.” These hefty buys show just how rapidly the global chip game is changing. As Microsoft explores FPGAs as a way of accelerating search, it’s training deep neural networks with massive farms of GPUs, chips originally built for rendering images for games and other highly graphical software. So many other Internet companies are doing the same. And at Google, engineers have gone so far as to build their own alternative chip, dubbed the TPU. After GPUs help train a neural network to, say, recognize faces in photos, Google’s TPUs help execute this neural network, putting it to use in the real world. It’s an attack of the geek acronyms. FPGAs. GPUs. TPUs. And certainly, keeping it all straight is far from easy. But the trend isn’t hard to see. The world is moving onto Internet services, and these Internet services now require many chips beyond the classic CPU. As Microsoft vice president Peter Lee explains it, our Internet services are evolving more quickly than our CPUs. CPUs continue to mature according to Moore’s Law, getting faster every two years or so, but that’s not enough to accommodate the rise of deep learning. Nor can it handle the tremendous growth of our online services. So, we need chips that can handle “post-CPU workloads,” in the words of Lee, who oversees a new Microsoft Research operation called NExT. “Increasingly, we’re looking at more specialized hardware,” he says. It’s significant that so many acronyms are in the mix. We’re at the beginning of this movement, with Internet companies exploring so many possibilities, and it’s unclear how things will eventually pan out. Will the market settle on one or two chips? Or it will it be more? And what will those be? It’s telling that Intel has acquired not just Altera, but Nervana too. Wherever the market goes, it wants to be there. Go Back to Top.

Users claimed that Google had deliberately removed the nation from its mapping services, leaving behind Israel as the only recognised country in the region. While this angered Twitter users around the world, it also sparked calls for Google to reinstate Palestine on Maps and for the Californian-based company to issue an apology to the Palestinian people. “[Our group] condemns the crime carried out by Google in deleting the name of Palestine, and calls for Google to rescind its decision and apologize to the Palestinian people," said the Forum of Palestinian Journalists. The furore has escalated to the point where more than 3000,000 people have signed a petition to get Google to put Palestine back on Maps. Even Al Jazeera weighed in on the matter with a quick social video , indicating that one reason for its omission could be because the US – where Google is based – doesn't recognise Palestine as a country. Twitter users also started sharing their opinions and boycotting Google services under the hashtag #PalestineIsHere . However, as Google eventually went on to explain, Palestine never actually existed on Google Maps in the first place. Speaking to Engadget , Google explained: "We discovered a bug that removed the labels for 'West Bank' and 'Gaza Strip'. We're working quickly to bring these labels back to the area." (Photo: Bloomberg) Before West Bank and Gaza Strip were removed from Google Maps, they were both defined as cities within the region of Palestine – a "de jure sovereign state" as per the UN’s own terminology. The fact that Google never defined Palestine on Google Maps may not make the situation any better, but it's interesting to see how quickly social media can mobilise people towards a cause – even when they aren't presented with all the facts. That said, as Engadget points out, companies such as Google, Apple and Microsoft all need to be aware that their services are more than just a means to find directions or answer questions – they have a huge impact on how people see the world.

a b A compulsive audience and a complicit news media When is a distribution method that harms users’ brains no longer an acceptable cost of doing business? By Danny Funt, CJR August 12, 2016 3382 words a Share on Twitter b Share on Facebook Email this story Illustration by Ben Sanders In 2007, two years after the launch of The Huffington Post and two weeks before the incorporation of Twitter, Arianna Huffington collapsed in her office from fatigue. She regained consciousness in a pool of blood with a broken cheekbone and an epiphany about the internet. Her exhaustion was symptomatic of a public health crisis, she declared: Our addiction to modern technology creates the need for “digital detoxing.” Since then, the soon-to-be-former head of one of the most popular and prolific news websites has campaigned for a health awakening rooted in the belief that digital media, consumed in large doses, are, effectively, toxic. Time is money on the internet, and The Huffington Post thrives in an online economy where “free” products are most profitable when they occupy, or divert, our attention the longest. The site publishes enough for about 100 hours of reading a day, much of it seen on smartphones via an aggressive social media push. In the last two years, HuffPo has also featured nearly 100 posts tagged “Digital Detox,” often of the not-so-academic sort, as in, “Why I Think I Need to Break Up With the Internet.” It may be more productive to read journalism than to scroll through drivel and fluff, but showered in salt, a plate of kale and a plate of French fries will both raise your blood pressure. While preparing for an event in June where she discussed sleep deprivation with Hamilton creator Lin-Manuel Miranda, Huffington considered written questions from CJR. “There’s a paradox, of course, in being a digital media company committed to telling stories about the importance of unplugging,” she wrote, “but it’s one we embrace!” A profile of her in The New York Times last year framed that irony less forgivingly: “It’s as though Huffington is spreading an illness while simultaneously peddling the cure.” Because injuring your customers and then profiting from their healing is the essence of capitalistic depravity; because journalism is meant to nourish minds, rather than impair them; and because The Huffington Post is not unique in most ways, the Times’ description of Arianna Huffington reads as an indictment of her industry. Either the need to unplug is unfounded, or digital news media must do more to explain integrating their business with an intoxicant. “The problem with our addiction to our devices is not so much consuming journalism,” Huffington said, “as constantly being tethered to our texts, emails, constant notifications, and social media.” Despite her conviction about the gravity of the science, she said it didn’t necessitate a change in HuffPo’s publishing model. However, she has since decided that the best platform for detox evangelism isn’t journalism, but consulting: Yesterday she announced that she’s leaving The Huffington Post to work full-time on a startup with the murky mission of promoting employee wellness. Embed from Getty Images In recent years, many news organizations have reported on the damage done by the incessant pull of our digital devices. Yet they, too, look in the mirror and shrug. Jacob Weisberg, the chairman and editor in chief of Slate, has written about our fixation with devices but, like Huffington, he doesn’t fault news media. “I don’t think people have any problem overreading longform magazine articles,” he explains. As for the dilemma of news outlets partnering with social platforms that feed on compulsive behavior, he says, “Most news publishers would love to figure out a way to become a little more addictive.” Moreover, “content companies have to go where the readers are.” But as outlets tailor their content to addictive platforms to pump up traffic, the distinction between consuming journalism and being wedded to “emails, constant notifications, and social media” is increasingly meaningless. It may be more productive to read journalism than to scroll through drivel and fluff, but showered in salt, a plate of kale and a plate of French fries will both raise your blood pressure. In May, The Washington Post published “13, right now,” a profile of an ordinary girl in Virginia who, like all her friends, is obsessed with Snapchat, Instagram, and Twitter. She appears smart and nice, but her fixation with her phone is unambiguously worrisome, and the Post has reported extensively on the dangers of tech’s addictiveness, particularly for teenagers. This is what it's like to grow up in the age of likes, lols and longing https://t.co/UidGEMzyDX pic.twitter.com/6zkoA3mLaL— Washington Post (@washingtonpost) May 25, 2016 How does a respected news organization write a profile of a teen’s compulsive overuse of social apps, report on the research indicating that such behavior risks harming people’s brains, and then aggressively promote its content on those very apps and form publishing partnerships with them? The Post declined to discuss the topic.   All new forms of media, from the first printed book to the latest virtual reality headset, have provoked debate over whether their popularity signals progress. The tech journalist Nicholas Carr was enthusiastic about computers at first. Slowly, it became harder for him to be absorbed by a book while the Web tugged at his concentration every few pages. “My mind isn’t going—so far as I can tell—but it’s changing,” Carr wrote in his canonical 2008 Atlantic cover story, “Is Google Making Us Stupid?” Carr referenced a study that examined reading habits on two research websites and found most people are inclined to just skim and bounce around. “It almost seems that they go online to avoid reading in the traditional sense,” the study observed. Carr’s thesis is that if we are what and how we read, then our thinking will mirror the scattered and shallow tendencies of Web browsing. The piece evolved into his book The Shallows, a finalist for the 2011 Pulitzer Prize in nonfiction. Utopia Is Creepy comes out this fall. Embed from Getty Images New York Times Magazine and Wired writer Clive Thompson also has a conversion story. He was pessimistic about the internet at its inception; 20 years later, he wrote Smarter Than You Think: How Technology Is Changing Our Minds for the Better. “The Shallows has some terrific stuff in it,” he tells CJR, “but at that time there was this surge of confidence that we could understand complex brain science through neuroscanning. Most people who write about that have dialed back.” Carr says the effects of digital media must be interrogated from every angle. “The science aids us in what is fundamentally a cultural critique.”  The connection between behaviors and their cause in the brain “sounds impressive but turns out to be redundant,” Adam Gopnik of The New Yorker wrote in a 2011 piece evaluating polarized responses to the internet. It’s implicit that trouble paying attention, for instance, stems from neurological dysfunction. The healthiness of media consumption is especially contentious because it’s interdisciplinary: Mental wellbeing is an issue of brain science, but it’s also a type of moral question. The ancient Greek notion of a “flourishing” mind could not be measured with an MRI. “I can see my own attention span fragmenting in lots of ways,” Gopnik tells CJR. “It frightens me as an author.” But, he notes the absence of evidence confirming long-term damage. “If somebody had good, robust work that showed that kids who use social media at the age of nine are not going to be able to read constitutional law at the age of 18, I would take that seriously,” he says. “You need to have that kind of demonstrable science before you would hit the panic button.” Responses to new media are also notoriously reactionary. “So, yes,” Carr wrote in The Atlantic, “you should be skeptical of my skepticism. Perhaps those who dismiss critics of the Internet as Luddites or nostalgists will be proved correct.” Eight years later, amid ubiquitous smartphones and social media, Carr says one has less cause to be skeptical of his concerns about digital media. Internet optimists are largely unmoved. “Maybe they’ve become enslaved by some of the technology that they see as emancipating,” he tells CJR. Embed from Getty Images “We Are Hopelessly Hooked,” declared Weisberg, the Slate editor, in an essay earlier this year in The New York Review of Books. He begins by remarking on our obsessive attachment to smartphones—studies suggest we check them more than 200 times a day—and by noting surveys showing many people’s unhappiness while doing so. He concludes that “[w]e need a Web that is less corrosive to our humanity,” yet his piece makes no mention of the degree to which his profession is complicit. Weisberg tells CJR that he considers his own attention span to be undamaged, and he sees that supposed side-effect of digital media as unsubstantiated. If Weisberg’s attention span remains intact, he may be the exception. A few years ago, Farhad Manjoo, now a tech columnist at The New York Times, wrote a Slate piece headlined “You Won’t Finish This Article.” It describes how after every paragraph of a post online, a wave of readers flees, citing data from the traffic analysis firm Chartbeat. “Readers can’t stay focused. The more I type, the more of you tune out,” Manjoo writes. “And it’s not just me. It’s not just Slate. It’s everywhere online.” Companies on the internet tend to capture our attention by fracturing it. “Every time you check your phone,” the MIT psychologist Sherry Turkle writes in her latest book, Reclaiming Conversation, “what you gain is a hit of stimulation, a neurochemical shot.” Tech scholars like Turkle are studying how this fixation can induce anxiety and depression and reduce our ability to empathize. Tech insiders expect the internet’s efforts to seduce eyeballs to intensify, and tech journalists continue to report on the chilling consequences, particularly for young people. The fear is much less a sudden collapse, like Huffington’s, than a slow crippling. Embed from Getty Images “We have not assessed the full human consequences of digital media,” Turkle writes. “We want to focus on its pleasures. Its problems have to do with unintended consequences.” The internet is far too vast to weigh all of its virtues against its vices. Media leaders can ask a much simpler question: When is a distribution method that harms our customers’ brains no longer an acceptable cost of doing business?  Five years ago, when Google acquired a Web browser plug-in that Tristan Harris developed with a fellow recent Stanford grad, Harris went to work as “product philosopher” for the search giant. What he found there, and in Silicon Valley generally, is a lack of incentive to think about how devices ought to contribute to our lives; less is never more in the competition for our attention. With that mindset so entrenched, it would seem intimidating to be employed, in a sense, as Google’s conscience. “I’m not sure I’d call it intimidation,” he says, “so much as periodic hopelessness.” Harris left Google earlier this year to campaign for a realignment of the tech industry’s values. Having studied alongside future founders of Instagram and Snapchat in Stanford’s Persuasive Technology Lab, where students are taught the tricks computers use to manipulate users, then having worked in an industry that aspires to reshape humanity using those techniques, Harris wants to defeat the myth that moderating internet consumption is simply a matter of self-restraint. In an essay on Medium titled “How Technology Hijacks People’s Minds,” he details the way computers mimic slot machines to maximize addictive behavior, linking physical actions, like swiping to refresh a social media feed, with “intermittent variable rewards”—maybe there will be a new post, maybe not. It’s a game smartphone users itch to play every few minutes. To fuel the perpetual fear of missing something important (a sibling of “FOMO”), social feeds require a bottomless well of content. News media are a natural supplier. Embed from Getty Images This incites “a race to the bottom of the brain stem,” Harris tells CJR. “There’s an illusion that we don’t live in this environment of perverse incentives.” It’s a collective action problem: Companies might not want to exploit mental weaknesses to extend time-on-screen, but competition demands it. Attention-based economics are the rule of the internet, whether for social apps or news organizations. Harris is confident about where that market is heading, as companies that profit from overpowering our attention have only one path to growth: “It’s going to become more and more persuasive. The chance that you will lose your agency and end up doing something you didn’t intend to will only get worse. It can’t get better.” There is “Good news!” announced Microsoft last year—for advertisers, that is. In a consumer insights report that studied and surveyed Canadian media consumption, Microsoft found, “Overall, digital lifestyles deplete the ability to remain focused on a single task, particularly in non-digital environments,” adding, “Multi-screening trains consumers to be less effective at filtering out distractions—they are increasingly hungry for something new. This means more opportunities to hijack attention.” Out of context, the enthusiasm throughout the report could pass for satire.  Embed from Getty Images On the widely-read blog he’s maintained since 1999, the tech entrepreneur Anil Dash stresses that the internet follows cycles, giving hope that warped trends will straighten out. But lately, he tells CJR, he’s starting to question whether that rule still applies because of “the extreme centralization of titanically large companies,” while “the rate and severity of abuses coming from tech are only increasing.” He shares Harris’s skepticism that startups and struggling companies will forgo profit to honor their users’ best interests. “I’m not anti-tech,” Dash says. “But if we could do it without a business model that preys on distracting us and stressing us out, I’d go for that.” Some casinos try to cut off slot machine players who appear addicted, a New York Times story on the lure of technology notes, more likely in the interest of sustaining revenue streams than because of an ethical imperative. That doesn’t hold for the effects of internet overconsumption; it’s not so tangible as overspending or overeating. “There’s never a prompt to cut back,” Dash says. “You never get full.” Instead, he describes “a continuum of harm” on the Web, from the stressful deceit of clickbait articles to the unchecked harassment on social media. “We don’t have a framework for monitoring harm or measuring culpability,” he says. “Nobody wants to be the new cigarette industry, so the blame gets spread around so that no one company is accountable.” Studying technology is like “environmentalism of the mind,” the writer Clive Thompson says. Indeed, Sherry Turkle likens the perils of digital media to climate change: The upside is immediate, the worst problems are far off, and the industry lacks the incentive to change. Another popular analogy compares digital media to the food industry. “Just as the food industry manipulates our innate biases for salt, sugar, and fat with perfectly engineered combinations,” Tristan Harris writes, “the tech industry bulldozes our innate biases” for things like social approval and novelty-seeking. He hopes consumers will demand more mindful technology as they did healthier foods. Mental wellbeing is an issue of brain science, but it’s also a type of moral question. The ancient Greek notion of a ‘flourishing’ mind could not be measured with an MRI. But as Carr notes, “Cheap and pleasurable can overwhelm questions of quality.” The sight of widespread obesity raises alarms in a way that the sight of people glued to their phones cannot, and an expanding waistline is easier to self-identify than a diminishing mental capacity. The comparison also underscores the limits of anecdotal reporting: A fit person who regularly eats at McDonald’s proves nothing about the health risks of fast food. That said, focusing on the uncertain long-term consequences of overusing tech is an odd sort of farsightedness, like the drunk who wakes up each day with a terrible hangover but worries only about possibly endangering his liver. If digital media were like smoking cigarettes, “you can’t encourage that,” Thompson says. “But oh my goodness, we are so far from that. And anyone who is claiming that is being scientifically loose and a-historic.” He is right to put the health effects of technology in perspective, but asking if a product kills you is also a low bar for corporate responsibility. Embed from Getty Images The author Jonathan Franzen calls the analogy between food and media “politically unsettling.” “Since platforms that discourage engagement are less profitable,” he wrote in a review of Turkle’s Reclaiming Conversation for the Times, “they would have to charge a premium that only affluent, well-educated consumers of the sort that shop at Whole Foods are likely to pay.” This ominous hypothetical is of course true today, with paywalled news sites spared the need to stoop and claw for views. But Franzen’s point is also revealing of a more encouraging truth, which is that many of the concerns with social media relate only to the largest feed-based, advertising-oriented platforms. “As soon as you start selling [users’] eyeballs, you get pushed toward scale,” Thompson says, “and anytime you try and scale socializing, it breaks.” He adds, “The problem with feed-based social networks is that they privilege recency. Humans are already present-focused. One of the jobs of [reading] is to dislodge us from our present focus. Conversely, a lot of social media is obsessed with the idea of what’s happening right now. To me, this is a horrible design.”  I’m not anti-tech. But if we could do it without a business model that preys on distracting us and stressing us out, I’d go for that.” News outlets certainly shouldn’t abandon digital media, but they need to pursue online strategies that advance their work, rather than degrading their work to advance online strategies. Some engineers in Silicon Valley feel handcuffed by the pressures of their industry, and journalists can relate. Many media leaders say the industry is too tumultuous right now to pass up business opportunities, although even at Google, a $500 billion company, Tristan Harris felt that a more humane corporate mindset was hopeless. Government regulation is one option—an “FDA for tech,” Harris imagines—but that idea is usually floated and dismissed in the same breath, as most people in news and tech are unenthusiastic about laws constraining mass media. Another option is a shift in consumer values, which could be partially inspired, like many such movements, by stirring journalism.   Much has been said about the precarious decision to publish journalism directly to Facebook and the vicious harassment that thrives on social media, especially toward women and minorities, along with issues of platform editorial bias and censorship. Social media also offer wonderful opportunities for journalism. Yet social strategies for news media are largely beholden to business interests. That some content must be cheapened, sensationalized, and churned out in bulk to amass traffic and woo advertisers may seem justifiable if it finances more meaningful work. The fear of digital media’s addictiveness, though, isn’t just that it compels us to consume shallow things, but that it might impair our ability to do otherwise. Adam Gopnik asks whether young people who spend years compulsively on their phones will be able to read constitutional law. How about The New Yorker?

We talk a little about where the concept of SpyFu came from, its evolution, and some of the unique ways you can use the tool’s information to improve your marketing efforts. Here are a few transcribed excerpts from our discussion, but make sure to listen to the podcast to hear everything: What is SpyFu? You can go to SpyFu and type in any website and see every keyword that they’ve ever bought on Google. You can see all their organic keywords and how those have changed over the last 10 years. You can pinpoint any sort of Google algorithm change and how that effected a website. You can also see how a company started their AdWords campaign and how they changed their ad copy and changed their keyword groups to squeeze out the highest conversion rates. Ultimately, the goal is to spy on your competitors and figure out their secrets. Often times, we get focused on like, “Well, this guy is my direct competitor across the street.” Or you’re at Search Engine Journal, so you might be looking at Search Engine Land. Often times, what you really want to look for are people who you admire. You want to look at the ones who are,  executing well or growing fast. From your perspective, a competitor you might not think about would be, like, Wordstream or Moz or Quick Sprout, who, have really great content marketing campaigns. You might look into their content and try to find their best Evergreen content and see if you can improve upon it. Any examples of people using SpyFu in an effective and useful way? In terms of PPC, there’s two core things that are, sort of, advanced or things that people should use. SpyFu is used to spy on your competitors and download their keywords. That’s core to our model. Right? Everybody knows SpyFu for that. The reality is, if you want to be really successful, you need to look at what has worked in other people’s AdWords campaigns. The thing is, we have the entire AdWord’s campaign history, meaning, everything that they’ve ever done on AdWords, we have for nearly 99% of domains. Right? Just as an example: Groupon. We’ve been collecting data for four years longer than they’ve been a company. As a result, we have their very first ad they ever ran on Google. Then we have every test that they’ve ever run, every split test. We have their A, their B, their C, their D, all they way through their first keyword. You’re looking at 22 different tests you can tell which one won, over all that time. The ad copy is, actually, the greatest predictor of quality score. Focusing on improving your ad copy and figuring out what didn’t work, is a sure way to figure out what is going to work for you. It’s called SpyFu Ad History. We have that for domains. We also have it for keywords. You can look at an individual keyword and see everybody that’s ever advertised on that keyword. Take that Groupon example. I think their first keyword, it’s like Daily Deals or something like that, right? If you look at Daily Deals, if I were to pull it up here in SpyFu, there’d probably be something on the order of 50 advertisers or so who have advertised on that. Each of those guys, you’ve got Groupon, and then you’ve got Living Social, each of those guys is going to have 15 different ad copy tests that they’ve run. You’ve got everything that’s ever been tested on that keyword. You can figure out, “Well, they ran this one for a few months and then they ran this one partially.” You can see it intermingle in there when it’s running 50-50. Then you can see the one that they decided on and then you can see the next evolution and so on and so forth. Any other areas that jump out as not so obvious, but extremely valuable? On the AdWord side, the most valuable tool we’ve ever built takes all these lessons about history and about things that your competitors are buying, the idea is that looking at a single competitor is interesting. If they’re doing something and you’re not, you could look at that. When many of your competitors are all betting their money on the same keywords and you’re not, that is a really strong signal to look at that keyword. In addition, if you factor in that they’ve been buying it, repeatedly, over time and increasing their positions and increasing their bid, then that’s the strongest possible signal. We’ve taken all of that wisdom, all of that knowledge, that we’ve learned over the last 10 years of doing this, we built it into a single report. This is called the AdWord’s Advisor Report. What it does is, it tells you, point-blank, “You should buy these keywords.” It gives you a list of the top keywords that you’re not buying, that you should. It even tells you whether or not you should buy the phrase match or the modified broad or just buy the exact. It tells you those things, it tells you how much traffic you’d get and how much you’d spend. It also tells you, “You know what? None of your competitors are buying these keywords that you’re showing up on. You’re probably broad matching into them, you should use negative matches.” This is a simple report. All you do is, you type in your domain and it selects the competitors for you. You run the report, then it gives you this advice. It’s point and click, super simple. It takes all that stuff and makes it really easy. Interestingly, this is sort of the same type of thing that Bid Management Tools will do.  If you use, Quizzio, WordStream, or Morin, or something like that, they’ll give you really good advice. For people who don’t know the history of the Google API thing and the Raven Tools thing, Google, kind of, enforces this separation of church and state. [With] a lot of the low hanging fruit, how do you know whether what you’re doing is actually going to cause long-term damage? If you’re in it for the long-haul and we’re, obviously, one of those companies that is in it for the long-haul, you look at it and you’re like, “Well, how much risk am I willing to put into building backlinks, when 2 or 3 years from now, Google might penalize us for this?” If you open up Majestic or Moz or whatever and you put in your competitor’s domain, and you’re like, “I’m going to go through here and I’m going to find out whether they have some links that would like to get.” Or, however, you want to start this process. If you go in there you end up seeing millions and millions of backlinks from all over, like, every dark corner of the internet. You can look at the Domain Authority and try to figure out, “Which ones of these might work for me?”, but you really don’t know that much about those links. You have to research each one and it really kills the productivity of the whole thing. Right? First of all, there’s a whole bunch of duplicates. You might be looking through there and you have to scroll through many, many pages to find things that you need. We built a backlink tool about 2 years ago. The guiding principle was, Let’s only show you backlinks that are going to be safe for you. Let’s never show any duplicates, either. Let’s just make the thing as highly productive as it can possibly be and make it so that you never have to worry about if this link is going to get you in trouble. The core reason that these are safe backlinks, is that they’re all indexed by Google. They’re, currently, indexed by Google. What’s interesting about that is, because we have our other database, we have the SpyFu database, is we know exactly what the authority, what’s the link equity from that link going to get you, because we know what every page ranks on.   To listen to this Marketing Nerds podcast with Mike Roberts & Brent Csutoras: Download and listen to the full episode at the top of this post Subscribe via iTunes Sign up on IFTTT to receive an email whenever the Marketing Nerds podcast RSS feed has a new episode Listen on Stitcher Think you have what it takes to be a Marketing Nerd?

 Russia hit Google with a $6.8 million fine over alleged antitrust violations on Android Rob Price Aug. 12, 2016, 5:12 AM 2,054 facebook linkedin twitter email print Russian President Vladimir Putin.REUTERS/Alexander Zemlianichenko/Pool Another day, another antitrust headache for Google. The Californian search giant has been hit with a $6.8 million fine in Russia over its Android mobile operating system, Ars Technica reported on Thursday. Google, by allegedly forcing smartphone manufacturers to install Google Search and not pre-loading rival apps, violated competition rules, the Federation Anti-monopoly Service (FAS) ruled. Google, which is appealing the ruling, confirmed the fine in a statement: "We have received notice of the fine from FAS and will analyse closely before deciding our next steps. In the meantime, we continue to talk to all invested parties to help consumers, device manufacturers and developers thrive on Android in Russia." The Russian ruling is similar to antitrust cases Google is facing elsewhere in the world. In Europe, the American technology company has been charged with abusing its dominant position on mobile to promote its products over those of its competitors. And on Friday morning, The Financial Times reported that South Korea's antitrust watchdog is investigating Google over potential antitrust violations. $6.8 million is chump change for Google, which has annual global revenues of $75 billion. But the Russian regulator is also asking Google to change how it does business — a demand that, if successful, would have a much more significant impact on the company. The Russian complaint stems from a 2014 complaint against Google by Yandex, a local search competitor. The FAS ruled against it in 2015, it appealed, and lost in March 2016.

Google lost an appeal against the agency’s finding in March 2016. The fine was calculated as a share of Google Play's domestic sales for 2014. According to local rules, fines must be 1% to 15% of an offending company’s annual revenue, the Russian watchdog told Bloomberg. In 2015, the agency ruled that Google’s actions were illegal because forcing manufacturers to pre-install its search, mapping and other apps, gave it an unfair advantage over competitors. The agency’s ruling followed an investigation after complaints by Russian search engine company Yandex, which is Google’s biggest competitor in the country. The fine comes on top of the Russian agency ordering Google to end deals with suppliers that restrict what third-party apps they can pre-install. New appeal planned Google plans another appeal on 16 August against the agency’s findings that the internet giant is abusing its market dominance through Android, according to the Financial Times. Google faced similar complaints in April 2016 from the European Commission (EC) over restrictive contracts requiring phone manufacturers to install Google apps on new phones. Read more about Google’s anti-trust case Pre-installing Google Search and Play on devices is anti-competitive and limits consumer choice, claims EC The European Commission gives backing to new proposals from Google, putting to rest accusations of anti-competitive behaviour on company’s search sites Google has submitted several proposals in response to concerns by European competition authorities in an attempt to avoid punitive fines An EC investigation also found that Google pays manufacturers and telecom operators a share of ad revenue if they agree to keep its search engine as a default option on the devices. The EC said pre-installing and setting Google as the default, or exclusive, search service on most Android devices sold in Europe closed off ways for rival search engines to access the market, via competing mobile browsers and operating systems. Complaints in Europe The complaints around Google’s abuse of its dominant position in Europe on the Android platform are part of a raft of complaints by the EC over the company’s business practices. The EC is pressing Google to change some of its business practices relating to restrictions to rival third-party websites from displaying search ads and ranking its own services higher than rivals in search results. The EC started investigating Google’s practices in November 2010, notifying the company in March 2013 of concerns that the US firm had abused its dominance of the search market. Google reportedly accounts for 90% of the European Union (EU) search market. After nearly six years of trying to settle the case, the EC is expected to issue a fine of around €3bn in 2016, but has been in the process of finalising its case for months. As well as the fine, Google is expected to be banned from manipulating search results to favour its services over competitors', but could appeal against both in the European Court of Justice. Korean probe Meanwhile, The Korea Fair Trade Commission is investigating Google’s advertising policy in response to a complaint by Korean advertising agents in 2014 that Google had not paid it commissions for online advertising since 2012, according to the Financial Times. Local media reports have also suggested the Google is under investigation over alleged abuse of its Android smartphone operating system’s dominance. Android has a strong presence in the South Korean smartphone market, but Google is a minor player in the country’s search market, with a  share of less than 10%.

REUTERS/Stephen Lam - RTX29NQI Nearly 15 years after the Sept. 11 attacks, terror organizations like Al Qaeda and Islamic State operate online unobstructed – propagandizing, recruiting and hacking. The fight against cyber jihad is neither easy nor is it cheap, and the West must engage tech companies’ capabilities if it wants to win against these groups on the battlefield and in cyberspace. The Obama administration can be credited with putting pressure on social media companies following the deadly attacks in Paris, Brussels, San Bernardino and Orlando. Our next president needs to continue the coordinated efforts between tech companies and outside experts to quash using the Internet as a jihadist playground. Along with academics, researchers and executives from 49 major technology, advertising and entertainment companies – including Apple, Facebook, Google, Twitter and Microsoft – I participated in the Madison Valleywood Project on February 24  -- the White House summit on countering violent extremism (CVE) online. The summit, organized by the Justice Department, was a unique opportunity to examine ways to challenge ISIS and its brand online. It followed other welcome moves by tech companies, including Facebook, which has taken the lead in shutting down terrorist accounts. Twitter also has recently moved firmly in this direction – at least for the time being. And, on May 20, Microsoft announced that it would not be allowing terrorist content on its platforms.  But it is not only the social media companies that should be participating in these efforts. It is time for their founders and top executives, many of them billionaires, to do so. A first step would be collectively signing a public pledge and creating a fund to develop ways to stop jihadis from using their platforms – not just via their companies, but as private citizens and philanthropists, as well. Such an initiative by industry leaders like Microsoft founder Bill Gates, Twitter co-founder and CEO Jack Dorsey, Apple CEO Tim Cook, Google co-founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page and Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg could certainly jump-start this effort and galvanize the entire industry to join it. This public pledge should highlight their desire to put an end to terrorists' use of their platforms while protecting privacy and freedom of speech, and should include the creation of industry standards for dealing with the problem – so that the next generation of tech companies will have a blueprint to follow. These tech leaders have come together in the past on issues ranging from climate change to immigration; there is no reason why they cannot do the same to stop cyber jihad. They should begin to offer conceptual and financial support to stop what they themselves inadvertently created. These individuals are tremendously generous, and give billions to worthy causes. The tech industry creates more multimillionaires and billionaires than any other sector; the incredible technological advances these innovators have brought to the world have earned them wealth beyond imagining.  But one area left unsupported: the urgent national security threat of cyber jihad. Some key tech leaders have even been targeted by ISIS and Al Qaeda. The last two editions of Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula's Inspire magazine included threats against Bill Gates, Oracle founder and CEO Larry Ellison, and former New York City mayor and media mogul Michael Bloomberg, who on June 30 in The Wall Street Journal called on tech companies to do more in fighting terrorism. Twitter's Dorsey has received death threats from ISIS sympathizers on numerous occasions on his own platform. Considering that Twitter has been the heart and soul of cyber jihad, its top current and former executives should be the first to join the effort to combat it. After Twitter, jihadis rely heavily on YouTube and its parent organization, Google Inc. – both now part of Alphabet. For nearly a decade, YouTube has been used extensively by Al Qaeda and its offshoots, including ISIS. YouTube and Google founders and senior staff, many of whom are generous philanthropists, could be supporting efforts to fight these cyber jihadi efforts. They include co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, and executive chairman Eric Schmidt. Facebook's action in this sphere could serve as a model for the entire industry; its leadership has gone on record as stating that it is dedicated to this fight, and has made concerted efforts in it. This includes Zuckerberg, against whom ISIS has made multiple death threats and COO Sheryl Sandberg, who recently suggested that Facebook users launch a digital war against ISIS by "liking" and posting kind messages on pages affiliated with it. Instagram, which was bought by Facebook, is increasingly popular among jihadis. Its cofounders Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger also could be supporting efforts against cyber jihad.  The company has also come under threat by jihadis, including on July 28 by a pro-ISIS disseminator whose account is frequently suspended -- he issued a warning he wants to behead Instagram’s staff.  The San Francisco-based Internet Archive (archive.org), which is run by its founder and digital librarian Brewster Kahle, is absolutely essential to both ISIS and Al Qaeda, as well as other jihadis, and is used daily for disseminating videos. Kahle should also be active against cyber jihad.   Snapchat's popularity among jihadis has increased a great deal recently; at last count, the company and co-founder Evan Spiegel’s worth have increased drastically.  He, too, should be supporting anti-cyber-jihad efforts. Social media and other tech companies have recently developed another industry that is both generating a great deal of funds for them and proving to be one of the most important developments for national security: encryption technology, which jihadis are increasingly adopting. The heads of these companies should at the same time be helping to prevent jihadi use of their products.  They include at Apple Tim Cook, along with widow of Apple founder Steve Jobs, Laurene Powell Jobs and others who have made billions at the company.  Pavel Durov, the founder of Telegram, which over the past year has become a major driver of cyber jihad for pro-ISIS groups and has been threatened multiple times by ISIS on his own platform. Many more tech millionaire and billionaire philanthropists affiliated with social media companies and websites that are widely used by terrorist groups (too numerous to mention here) should be joining the fight against cyber jihad. These tech leaders wield as much or more influence as did Andrew Carnegie and John Rockefeller more than a century ago – and they need to consider that if they do not support the fight against cyber jihad, history may judge them as harshly as it has these "robber barons" of the Gilded Age.

With the new update, Google will begin requiring explicit authorisation every time a third-party site requests access to Google Sheets. The explicit authorisation will be required every time when the access request is made via Google Visualisation API or Google Query Language. Google says the effort is done to keep users’ information safe. Google says the change will be transparent for most developers but others may need to make some changes in order to continue accessing spreadsheet data. Google will start enforcing these requirements on September 14, 2016. Google recently introduced third-party plugins to make its productivity apps more useful on Android. With new plugin, Google’s productivity suites can extend functionality from apps like Scanbot, DocuSign and ProsperWorks into Docs and Sheets. Google Sheets is one of the most widely used online spreadsheet service. With Google doubling down on its consumer cloud services, the introduction of added security layer seems quite obvious. Google Sheets is also popularly used to generate forms and survey data inside webpages. Google says the change is not applicable when a user shares spreadsheet with “anyone who has the link can view” full right access and developers will need to chnage their codes whenever link sharing is not viable.

The feature arrived on iPhone devices first, and now the company has also rolled it out for Android users via Google Play. Furthermore, the latest beta version for Android also gets the ability to share content with multiple contacts and groups simultaneously. As mentioned, Android users are also now receiving the call back and voicemail features via the stable build from Google Play (v2.16.225), and the listing features the announcement in the changelog as well. These features were first seen in the Android beta version last month, then on the stable build of iOS earlier this week, and it is now rolling out to all users. The feature gives them the ability to leave a voicemail after a WhatsApp call is not answered. The voicemail will be sent just like a voice message; however the user cannot hear it before sending it (at least for now). This version also brings the ability to send secret fonts by typing ''' before and after the text.Android Police also noticed another new interesting feature in the latest beta version 2.16.230 for Android, *though we are seeing it in beta version 2.16.229 as well. The beta version has introduced the ability to send or forward content or messages to multiple people in one go. Instead of the earlier setting where a user could send or forward content or messages to only one person at a time, now multiple users can be selected at one go. If users are looking to share a photo, text, video, or even a document from their phone, they have to select the send or share option in the relevant app (for e.g., Google Photos), select WhatsApp, and then long press one user in the contact list that shows up. At that point, the option to select multiple users automatically pops-up. You can choose individual as well as group chats together. This eradicates the pain to send content to one person, and then go back and send the same content to another person/group, until it reaches all the desired users. Furthermore, WhatsApp even shows three most frequent chats right on top for more ease in sharing and forwarding content. It works the the same way for forwarding - users can now forward any message (including previously attached files) to multiple users. In order to see the new features, you need to register for the Google Play beta testing program for WhatsApp, and then download the latest build from the store. Alternatively, you can even download the signed apk from APK Mirror. WhatsApp is said to be working on video calling, and support for gif image sharing, and is expected to release these features soon. It recently introduced bigger emojis, and the ability to zoom in and out when recording video from the app. Tags: Apps, Google Play, Social, WhatsApp, WhatsApp Voicemail Feature, WhatsApp for Android, WhatsApp for iPhone Tasneem AkolawalaEmail Tasneem When not expelling tech wisdom, Tasneem feeds on good stories that strike on all those emotional chords.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Friday, 12 August 2016 | MYT 4:14 PM S.Korea says investigating whether Google broke antitrust laws Formal scrutiny: South Korea's antitrust regulator said it is looking into whether Google has violated the country's anticompetition laws. — Reuters SEOUL: South Korea's antitrust regulator said on Aug 12 it is looking into whether Google has violated the country's anticompetition laws, acknowledging formal scrutiny of the global Internet search company for the first time. The Korea Fair Trade Commission (KFTC) disclosed the investigation in a brief statement, without commenting on the nature of the probe nor any potential antitrust violations. A person familiar with the matter told Reuters last month the KFTC inspected Google's Seoul headquarters in July. The antitrust body's statement came after a local media report said the KFTC had decided to clear Google of anticompetition charges involving the pre-loading of the company's apps on smartphones running on the Android operating system. Google, whose corporate parent is Alphabet Inc, declined to comment. While it wasn't clear whether the probe would lead to any formal charges, the investigation opens another regulatory front for Google. The firm was fined US$6.8mil (RM27.35mil) in Russia on Aug 11 and faces multiple European Union antitrust charges. The KFTC has investigated Google before. In 2013, the regulator cleared Google of wrongdoing following a probe into whether the company hurt competition by forcing smartphone makers using Android to pre-load its search engine on the handsets. — Reuters You May Be Interested EU rules to stem payment fraud may disrupt €6bil of e-commerce: Visa Yew Sin-Ee Yi continue fine run in Hong Kong Pokémon Go: Dittos are hiding in plain sight Fraud in Felda Global Ventures Rejuvenate yourself with American ginseng Apple issues recall on September, October 2015 iPhone 6S Others Also Read Dutch far-right leader Wilders tells court - 'I am no racist' M’sia, Thailand to begin talks on Bangkok-KL HSR project - Thai Minister Japan enlists Sailor Moon to promote safe sex advertisement Latest News Philippines money laundering body charges bankers for ignoring cyberheist Google nears tax settlement with Indonesian government: sources The new Vivo V5 takes the selfie crown Self-driving car group urges US regulators to clear road Singapore unveils self-driving scooter, ideal for phone-obsessed walkers Most Viewed in Tech Apple issues recall on September, October 2015 iPhone 6S Viral video will crash your iPhone The new Vivo V5 takes the selfie crown Pokémon Go: Dittos are hiding in plain sight Google nears tax settlement with Indonesian government: sources Self-driving car group urges US regulators to clear road Israeli firm can steal phone data in seconds Singapore unveils self-driving scooter, ideal for phone-obsessed walkers Pokémon Go says thanks and reshuffles CP Watch your self-ie!

Google Tests New Dashboard Tab in Google Now GO The new feature collects data from other Google sources Aug 12, 2016 07:47 GMT  ·  By Alexandra Vaidos  ·  Share:  Google has been making all sorts of changes to its Now launcher on Android smartphones, and it seems that it's preparing even more features. Recent information has pointed to the fact that the company is testing a new Dashboard tab in Google Now. A bottom row of tabs have been added to Google Now, containing the shortcuts to Google Home and Dashboard, says Android Police. The new Dashboard will collect data from across various Google services and provide it into one tab. The feature is said to accommodate the integration of Google Assistant, and it seems to only be working with the new Nexus Launcher. The Dashboard will collect data like reminders, events on the calendar, to-do lists saved in Keep, emails, photos from Assistant in Google Photos, and much more. Needless to say, the feature will be very useful for people to keep an eye on the events that they wish to attend and tasks that they must complete, all neatly arranged in one place and easy to access. It's unknown at this point if the new Dashboard will have features that allow third-party services to collect and display data. The new Dashboard seems to be connected to the new Nexus Launcher There's not much information on the new Dashboard, and it might be connected to the Nexus Launcher leak, considering that only some users see it. The new Nexus Launcher would only appear on upcoming Nexus smartphones that are set to be released this year, but it's unclear if it will also be provided for previous Nexus phones as well. Google has recently added Explore Interests feature to Google Now, thus preparing for the integration of Google Assistant. The feature would allow users to get information based on their interests and track the matters that they're most concerned about. Interests can be arranged into categories, including people, musicians, sports, and much more.   CHECK OUT THE GALLERY  (4 Images) #Google#Dashboard#Google Assistant#Google Photos#Google Now subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Google is testing new Dashboard feature (4 Images) 01 02 03 04 Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides Get Updates on Android and iOS Home Button in Nougat 7.0 Shown in Animation, Could Be Tied to Google Assistant New Nexus Devices to Come with Swipe Fingerprint Gesture Google's New Nexus Launcher May Arrive on Sailfish and Marlin Nexus Phones iPhone 8 to Feature Traditional Wireless Charging like the Samsung Galaxy S7 Lenovo Builds a New Microsoft Surface Clone and It Looks Fabulous Anonymous Hackers Want McAfee to Be Trump’s Security Adviser, Call for March Hackers Could Infect Headphones to Spy on You HTC Desire 650 Announced, a Low Mid-End Smartphone for the Masses Glossy Black Galaxy S7 edge Leaks in Live Pictures Download Windows 10 64-bit Drivers for Acer’s Aspire TC-710 Desktop Model Intel Rolls Out Several New BIOS Versions for Its NUC Kits and Compute Sticks 4 photos    New Dashboard tab in Google Now New Android APKs VivaVideo APK: Updated November 23rd, 14:19 GMT PowerDirector APK: Updated November 23rd, 14:08 GMT WeVideo APK: Updated November 23rd, 14:04 GMT Amazon Rapids APK: Updated November 23rd, 14:02 GMT ActionDirector APK: Updated November 23rd, 13:58 GMT DataEye APK: Updated November 23rd, 13:46 GMT JOOX APK: Updated November 23rd, 13:46 GMT Reader comments HTC 10 Evo Officially Introduced with 5.5-Inch QHD Display, Snapdragon 810 CPU more on: HTC 10 Evo i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2016 Softpedia.

vator vatorX vatornews Register Log in Newsroom Innovation series Interviews Lessons learned Trends & news With Bill Maris leaving, will GV be ok without him? Maris has said he is leaving the firm "because everything is great" Financial trends and news by Steven Loeb August 12, 2016 | Comments Short URL: http://vator.tv/n/46c1 After it was reported on Wednesday that GV founder and chief Bill Maris would be leaving the firm, he gave an interview to ReCode in which he explained his decision to step down. This was his answer: "GV is seen as a premier venture capital operation around the world. If it weren’t in great shape, that would be the wrong time to leave. I’m leaving because everything is great." Of course, if reports are accurate, not everything was fine at GV. There have been rumblings of tension since Google became Alphabet, which happened almost exactly a year ago, including cost-cutting measures that have left some executives unhappy. So was everything "great" at GV? CB Insights broke down some of the data on how things had been going there over the last year. In short, investments made by the firm have slowed down considerably, but the state of the firm seems to be strong.  In 2015, GV reduced the number of new deals it was involved in by 43 percent from where they had been in 2015. When it came to seed deals, they dropped by 78 percent in the same time period, from 45 in 2014 to just 10 in 2015. Things began to pick up again a bit this year, as GV was the most active U.S. corporate venture arm in the first half of 2016, making 31 percent more deals than in the same period in 2015. Still, they are down by 30 percent from the first half of 2014. Still, by these measure, GV was not making as many investments as it once had been. Perhaps that had something to do with the emergence of Google Capital, the firm's venture arm for later-stage deals. There was also the fact that Google itself started making investments outside of either of its venture arms. So did GV start to lose some of its influence over dealflow at Google? According to the data, not really. Google Capital was founded in 2013, but GV's investments didn't really start to go down until the beginning of 2015. And even then it maintained a clear lead in the number of new deals from either Google Capital or Google itself. In fact, there was only one quarter where Google Capital had more than three new deals, so its hard to see there being all that much competition.  There's one big piece of data that shows that GV has been doing just fine: it's biggest exit came earlier this week, when Walmart acquired online shopping website Jet.com. The price was approximately $3 billion in cash, a portion of which will be paid over time. Additionally, $300 million of Walmart shares will be paid over time as part of the transaction. That $3.3 billion just beat out the $3.2 billion that Google paid for Nest in 2014. The firm's third largest exit, HomeAway, which was bought by Expedia, occurred in November of last year. That means two of GV's biggest exits ever happened within the last year, a pretty good sign. GV is a non-strategic and independent venture arm of Alphabet. The firm has $2.4 billion under management, 300 portfolio companies, and offices in Mountain View, San Francisco, Boston, New York, and London. Some of its most high profile Investments include Uber, Nest, DocuSign, Cloudera, Flatiron Health, and Foundation Medicine. Of course, not all investments could be winners. The firm also put multiple rounds of money intp anonymous app Secret, which was forced to shut down early last year. But, overall, it seems like Maris is leaving the company in good hands. His replacement will be David Krane, the firm's managing partner, who co-manages the fund. Krane has been with Google for over 16 years, where he spent over nine years as its director of Global Communications and Public Affairs. occurred Permalink <span>Send</span> Related companies, investors and entrepreneurs Google Ventures Angel group/VC Description: GV provides venture capital funding to bold new companies.

Updated at 1.15pm EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 12.20pm EDT 12:20 European markets slip after US data In a quiet day’s trading, the main impetus in the end came from a poor set of US data, including retail sales, which suggested weakness in the world’s second largest economy and a possible delay to any US rate rise. An early dip on Wall Street helped take away any impetus from European markets, despite oil continuing to hold firm after its recent gains. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished virtually flat, up just 1.31 points or 0.02% at 6916.02 although the index was up nearly 2% on the week Germany’s Dax dipped 0.27% to 10,713.43 France’s Cac closed down 0.08% at 4500.19 Italy’s FTSE MIB edged up 0.17% to 16,997.83 Spain’s Ibex ended down 0.04% at 8716.4 In Greece, the Athens market added 0.66% to 576.12 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 49.41 points or 0.27%. Meanwhile, despite an initial hit to the dollar following the US data, the pound failed to hold onto any gains and is currently down 0.3% at $1.2917. Against the euro, sterling has fallen 0.59% to €1.1564.

A spokesman said: Mr Botman... previously worked in the Asia and Pacific Department—as the deputy chief on Japan as well as the IMF’s Resident Representative in the Philippines—the Economic Modeling Division in the Research Department, and the Fiscal Affairs Department. He participated in numerous missions, including in Europe (e.g. Germany, UK), and his research covers a variety of topics, including general equilibrium modeling, financial crises and speculative attacks, aging and social security reform in Europe and Japan, and public finance.

The firm has revised the fair value adjustment of its property fund from -7% on 6 July to -5%. Chief executive Martin Gilbert said: There is further evidence that calm and order are being restored to the UK commercial property market. The impact of the vote to leave the EU is being felt most in the Central London office market, which the portfolio has little exposure to, whereas the retail and logistics markets are holding up relatively well along with longer-leased properties and those less dependent upon future rental growth. The quality of our holdings has allowed us to re-assess the fair value adjustment we are applying in the light of further emerging evidence. Of course the situation remains very fragile so we will remain watchful and act accordingly in the interests of all our underlying investors.

Analyst Connor Campbell at Spreadex said: A worrisome afternoon of US data ensured that trading continued at the same uninspired pace it did during the morning. Dipping back under 18600 the Dow Jones was suitably unimpressed with what the US economy threw up this Friday. Retail sales were the most alarming figure, an upwards revision to 0.8% for June failing to compensate for the 0.0% growth managed across July; things get even worse when the automobile sector is stripped out, core retail sales plunging by -0.3% against the 0.2% increase that had been expected. Unsurprisingly given those sales figures the preliminary UoM consumers sentiment reading failed to see the recovery forecast, coming in at 90.4 against 90.0 last month and the 91.5 analysts had estimated. Yet the Dow Jones didn’t bear the brunt of the bad news; that honour went to the dollar, which immediately began to suffer as its hopes of a 2016 rate hike were dealt a significant blow. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 10.08am EDT 10:08 Brexit concerns appear to have been replaced by uncertainty ahead of the US election, according to the consumer confidence report. The survey’s chief economist, Richard Curtin said: Confidence inched upward in early August due to more favorable prospects for the overall economy offsetting a small pullback in personal finances. Most of the weakness in personal finances was among younger households who cited higher expenses than anticipated as well as somewhat smaller expected income gains. Concerns about Brexit have faded amid rising references to the outcome of the presidential election as a source of uncertainty about future economic prospects... Overall, the data remains consistent with real personal consumption expenditures improving at an annual rate of 2.6% through mid 2017, with new and existing home sales also benefitting from low mortgage rates. US consumer sentiment Photograph: University of Michigan Updated at 10.08am EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 10.04am EDT 10:04 US consumer confidence disappoints More weaker than expected US economic data, and thus more food for thought for Janet Yellen and her colleagues at the Federal Reserve. The University of Michigan survey of consumer sentiment came in at 90.4 in August’s preliminary reading, up from the final figure of 90 for July but below the expected level of 91.5.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 41 points or 0.23% lower while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq have also opened lower. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 9.05am EDT 09:05 IMF warns China’s economic transition will be ‘bumpy’ Julia Kollewe The International Monetary Fund has warned that China’s economic transition to more balanced, sustainable growth will be “complex, challenging and potentially bumpy”. In its latest assessment of the Chinese economy, the fund said China’s economy slowed to 6.9% growth last year, which is projected to ease to 6.6% this year due to slower private investment and weak external demand. It said: “The economy is advancing on many dimensions of rebalancing, particularly switching from industry to services and from investment to consumption. But other aspects are lagging, such as strengthening state-owned enterprise and financial governance and containing rapid credit growth.” Container ships docked at a port in Qingdao in eastern China’s Shandong province. Photograph: AP The Washington-based fund welcomed the “impressive progress” on structural reforms in many areas, notably interest rate liberalisation, internationalisation of the renminbi, and urbanisation; and the 13th five-year plan, with its ambitious goals centred on economic rebalancing. IMF directors “stressed the need for decisive action to tackle rising vulnerabilities; reduce the reliance on credit-financed, state-led investment; and improve governance, risk pricing, and resource allocation in the state-owned enterprise and financial sectors”. Inflation in China dipped below 1.5% in 2015 and is expected to pick up to around 2% this year, reflecting the rebound in commodity prices and the weaker renminbi since mid-2015 (the currency has lost some 4.5% of its value). China’s current account surplus is projected to decline to 2.5% of GDP this year, from 3% of GDP in 2015, as imports increase and the services deficit widens, with Chinese tourists continuing to head abroad. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 9.04am EDT 09:04 Here’s a chart showing the movement in US retail sales: US retail sales Photograph: US Census Bureau Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 8.51am EDT 08:51 The Fed is not likely to raise rates this year, according to economist James Knightley of ING Bank: US retail sales for July are disappointing, coming in flat on the month versus expectations of a 0.4% month on month gain. There was a modest upward revision (2 tenths of a percentage point) to June’s figure, but it is still a miss. Car sales were actually the strong point of the report, rising 1.1%. There had certainly been some good volume numbers, but with GM having offered deep discounts we thought that the value of auto sales may not be quite so good. In terms of other categories, there was a 2.7% drop in gasoline station sales, due to price falls, but there was also weakness in sporting goods (-2.2%), building materials (-0.5%) and food/beverages (-0.6%). Looking at the “control group” which excludes volatile items and has a better relationship with overall consumer spending growth, it was also flat on the month. This suggests that after a pretty disappointing second quarter GDP, the economy isn’t exactly roaring ahead at the start of the third quarter. We have also had some softer than expected producer price inflation numbers, with the headline annual rate dropping into negative territory at -0.2% year on year, while the core (ex food and energy inflation rate slowed markedly to 0.7% year on year from 1.3%. So with activity being softer than hoped and pipeline inflation pressures looking benign it doesn’t offer much support to the view the Fed will be hiking rates imminently. We favour the next Fed move higher to come in the first quarter of 2017. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 8.49am EDT 08:49 The US retail sales figures also showed a 0.3% fall excluding automobiles compared with expectations of a 0.2% rise. The data puts the Federal Reserve is something of a quandary, say analysts. Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.xom, said: Investors had waited with bated breath to see what today’s US retail sales numbers would say about the strength of the American economy, but have been left disappointed by a result that leaves opinions divided. Neither particularly strong, nor catastrophic, the slight decline in monthly data shows that the world’s largest economy is merely ticking along, which will leave Fed chair Janet Yellen with a head-scratcher. An interest rate rise will remain in the back of her mind, but with no real clues as to whether consumers would withstand monetary tightening, the wait goes to see if and when she’ll exact one. Peter Read, co-founder of trading network Pelican, said: Fed Chair Janet Yellen will be disappointed to not be able to add today’s retail sales data to the body of evidence she is building that supports raising interest rates later in the year. The possible intervention on rates received a notable backer in San Francisco Fed chief John Williams this week, which comes off the back of a second successive better than expected non-farm payroll result last week. However, Yellen and Co. will know that today’s surprisingly poor data is a significant drop from last month’s figures and further global market uncertainty, including equally poor Chinese data, may tempt the Fed to exercise caution. Next week’s inflation data will give observers further food for thought.

(AAPL), Alphabet Inc (GOOG, GOOGL) and IMAX Corporation (USA) (IMAX) 'Suicide Squad' set a new August IMAX record Aug 8, 2016, 8:34 am EST  |  By Karl Utermohlen, InvestorPlace Writer     The U.S. stock market reached new heights Friday, while oil prices continued to drop–now down six cents for the price of regular grade ($2.16) over the last two weeks. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 closed at a new high of 2,182.87 Friday, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average achieved the same feat, rising to 18,543.53. There was plenty of noise in the tech world over the weekend, with companies like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG,NASDAQ:GOOGL) making headlines. It was also a successful couple of days for one of the world’s leading cinema companies — IMAX Corporation (USA) (NYSE:IMAX). Here’s what you need to know: Apple Inc. (AAPL) Apple’s iPhone 7 continues to be a hot topic as consumers eagerly await the smartphone. 7 No-Name Tech Stocks That Will Make You Rich Whether or not the device will meet expectations is anyone’s bet, but more light is being shed on what we can expect from it. The iPhone 7 will include dual-lens camera technology, which means two lenses on one camera. Additionally, a new video was released that reveals three different versions of the device: a 4.7-inch iPhone 7, and two 5.5-inch smartphones–a ‘Plus’ and a ‘Pro.’ Apple may launch preorders for the phone on Sept. 9 of this year, with the iPhone 7 hitting stores on Sept. 16. AAPL shares are up 2.1% year to date. Alphabet Inc (GOOG, GOOGL) Google made plenty of headlines over the weekend, including an exciting new initiative by scientists. Researchers hope to use Google’s technology to learn more about valleys, mountains and underwater volcanoes. The project will take place over the next 14 years and it has at least 150 oceanographers signed on. The search engine recently expanded its Google Analytics tool — released in May 2016 — in order to share more data surrounding how much your website is covered with Google searches. Find out how to do so here. On a dimmer note, Alphabet’s self-driving project leader Chris Urmson is leaving the company in search for a new challenge. GOOG shares have risen 10% over the last three months, while GOOGL stock is up 11.3% over that span. IMAX Corporation (USA) (IMAX) IMAX had a strong weekend thanks to the release of Suicide Squad. The film — starring Jared Leto, Margot Robbie and Will Smith — set a new record for the largest IMAX debut in the month of August. Suicide Squad netted $18.2 million on more than 600 IMAX screens across the globe. $11 million — or 60.4% — of what the movie tallied involved U.S. cinemas. The previous August IMAX record was held by Guardians of the Galaxy, which earned $15.9 million worldwide in its opening weekend. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd: BABA Stock Has Double-Digit Potential Suicide Squad has been met with mixed reviews from fans, and it’s been generally panned by critics, garnering a 26% ‘Rotten’ vote on Rotten Tomatoes. IMAX shares could use a boost as the stock has declined 9.1% YTD. As of this writing, Karl Utermohlen did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

MNR Daily HOME U.S. WORLD ENTERTAINMENT SCIENCE/HEALTH TECH LIFE Subscriptions Home TECH 2016 Google Nexus release date update: Leaked benchmarks reveal Nexus to have same performance as Samsung Galaxy Note 7 Charles Lim Aug 13, 2016 11:16 PM Like Us Share on Facebook Share on Twitter (Google/Nexus)Google Nexus 6P The Nexus devices that Google has been faithfully releasing each and every year have mostly been devices that can be considered to be in the mid to high-end range with decent specs and some high-end components thrown in here and there. This year's HTC-made 2016 Google Nexus smartphones, however, might be a little different as several leaked benchmarking results have revealed that the upcoming smartphones may be at par with Samsung's latest phablet, the Samsung Galaxy Note 7, in terms of performance. The most recently leaked AnTuTu listing was discovered by Steve Hemmerstoffer from NowhereElse, who found the results on a Weibo page. The test results are allegedly for Google's smaller Nexus device, the Google Nexus Sailfish. According to the results, the Nexus device is equipped with the latest Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 processor, which is paired with 4 gigabytes (GB) of random access memory (RAM) and is offered with 32 GB of internal memory space. The alleged results also show that the Sailfish will be coming with a full HD 1080p display. The phone's camera setup is also revealed to be a 13-megapixel main and an 8-megapixel front camera systems. The results also reveal that the device is running the latest Android Nougat manufacturer release version. Based on the numbers that are shown in the leaked benchmark results, the Sailfish apparently matches the performance of the recently released Samsung Galaxy Note 7 and the Galaxy S7. The results are believed to be around the same figures for the Sailfish's larger sibling, the Google Nexus Marlin, as previous reports have predicted that both smartphones will be coming with the same internal specs and will only differ in their screen sizes. As for the release of the new Nexus smartphones, the latest reports have predicted the unveiling to be sometime in October, with the final version of the Android 7.0 Nougat operating system being released within this month.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Friday, 12 August 2016 | MYT 12:43 PM Russia fines Google 438mil rubles over antitrust charge Measured response: Google said in a statement sent to AFP: “We have received notice of the fine from FAS and will analyse closely before deciding our next steps.” — AFP MOSCOW: Russia’s antitrust authority fined Google 438mil rubles (RM27.34mil) after finding it guilty of abusing its dominant market position by forcing smartphone makers to install its search engine on Androids.  The Federal Antimonopoly Service (FAS) in September last year deemed Google in breach of a law on “protecting competition” after an investigation following a complaint by Russia’s largest search engine, Yandex.  Yandex asked the antitrust authorities to prevent Android phones from being automatically bundled with Google’s search engine.  The FAS said that Google has two months to pay the fine.  Yelena Zayeva, the head of its department for regulating communications and IT was quoted in the statement as saying the ruling “will allow the development of competition on the mobile software market in Russia, which will have a positive effect for consumers.”  All companies whose production is on sale in Russia have to observe the law on competition, “including transnational corporations,” Zayeva added.   Google said in a statement sent to AFP: “We have received notice of the fine from FAS and will analyse closely before deciding our next steps.”  ”In the meantime, we continue to talk to all invested parties to help consumers, device manufacturers and developers thrive on Android in Russia,” Google said.  The tech giant’s Android operating system dominates the smartphone market with a share of around 80%, which enables Google to offer search and other services to handset users.  Russia’s antitrust authority had been holding consultations with Google aimed at reaching an amicable agreement, but this required Google to admit guilt.  Google has insisted that consumers are free to choose whether to use its services.  Google has been hit by similar antitrust charges in other countries, particularly in the European Union, which has launched three cases against Google, one of which is specifically about using the dominance of the Android mobile phone operating system to restrict competition.  Russia’s antitrust authority this week also launched legal proceedings against US tech giant Apple over the alleged fixing of resellers’ prices for iPhones in the country.  Apple said in a statement sent to AFP: “Resellers set their own prices for the Apple products they sell in Russia and around the world.” — AFP You May Be Interested EU rules to stem payment fraud may disrupt €6bil of e-commerce: Visa Yew Sin-Ee Yi continue fine run in Hong Kong Pokémon Go: Dittos are hiding in plain sight Fraud in Felda Global Ventures Rejuvenate yourself with American ginseng Apple issues recall on September, October 2015 iPhone 6S Others Also Read Dutch far-right leader Wilders tells court - 'I am no racist' M’sia, Thailand to begin talks on Bangkok-KL HSR project - Thai Minister Japan enlists Sailor Moon to promote safe sex advertisement Latest News Philippines money laundering body charges bankers for ignoring cyberheist Google nears tax settlement with Indonesian government: sources The new Vivo V5 takes the selfie crown Self-driving car group urges US regulators to clear road Singapore unveils self-driving scooter, ideal for phone-obsessed walkers Most Viewed in Tech Apple issues recall on September, October 2015 iPhone 6S Viral video will crash your iPhone The new Vivo V5 takes the selfie crown Pokémon Go: Dittos are hiding in plain sight Google nears tax settlement with Indonesian government: sources Self-driving car group urges US regulators to clear road Israeli firm can steal phone data in seconds Singapore unveils self-driving scooter, ideal for phone-obsessed walkers Pokémon Go says thanks and reshuffles CP Watch your self-ie!

Picture: AFP Whether you use an Android device or an iOS one, it’s almost certain that you use some Google apps on a near-daily basis. In fact, apps like Gmail, YouTube are on the ‘must-have’ list of apps of just about every smartphone user. But did you know that Google has a whole bunch of ‘lesser known’ apps as well? These ‘less popular’ apps from Google are generally focused on specialized use cases. Nevertheless, chances are high that you might find some (or all) of them useful. So here is a list of some of the obscure Google-made apps. Android Device Manager If you ever happen to lose your Android smartphone, Android Device Manager will help you locate it. The app can come in really handy in tracking and getting back lost or stolen Android devices. It can even be used to factory reset devices remotely, provide the functionality has been configured properly beforehand. Google Authenticator If you use two-factor authentication, Google Authenticator is a must-have app. The app makes it easy to get time-bound authentication codes for logging into accounts in which you have two-factor authentication enabled. What’s best about Google Authenticator is that it works offline, and even for some non-Google services. Gesture Search Google’s Gesture Search app lets you access everything from apps to settings by just drawing gestures on the screen. The app refines search results as you keep on adding more gestures. If you hate searching for apps, settings etc. by typing, Gesture Search is just what you need. Google Keep Google’s Keep note-taking app makes jotting down quick notes a walk in the park. The app includes features like colour-coded notes, quick to-do lists, reminders and a lot more. And since all the notes are synced to your Google account, they are available across all the devices that you use Google Keep on. Inbox Gmail surely works great for handling email, but Google’s Inbox isn’t half bad either. Apart from having almost all of Gmail app’s functionality, Inbox has features like automatic highlighting of emails having information like flight check-ins and transaction receipts. The app also can also bundle similar messages together and includes the option to snooze email messages so they can be acted upon later. Google My Business Google My Business lets you verify your business information, manage customer reviews, get insights on how customers are interacting with your business and build your brand. It not only keeps you aware of what’s happening in your business, but also notifies you when customers are talking about it. Arts and Culture You don’t have to be an art lover to use Art and Culture. The app has been there for quite a while, but recently got a makeover. True to its name, Art and Culture displays information about art and cultural artifacts from over 1,000 museums around the world. You can search for different artifacts, read about art-related movements and historical events. It even has a companion virtual reality experience that can be used with Google Cardboard. -TOI Indie RELATED ARTICLES Entertainment Ellen DeGeneres gets emotional receiving Presidential Medal of Freedom KwaZulu-Natal ANC condemns unlawful land invasions KwaZulu-Natal Health literacy is essential KwaZulu-Natal Storms on the way to KZN Entertainment Gucci Maine and Keyshia Ka’oir officially engaged NO COMMENTS LEAVE A REPLY Cancel reply You must be logged in to post a comment.

The Indian Express Nation World Opinion Entertainment Lifestyle Technology Viral Photos Videos E-Paper Apps RSS Home Compare News Mobile & Tabs Gadgets Science Indian Express Home Home Technology Tech News Google’s Gmail will now warn users of malicious links in messages Google’s Gmail will now warn users of malicious links in messages Gmail on Android and the web will warn users if they receive a message with a dangerous or malicious link. By: Tech Desk | Published:August 12, 2016 10:16 am Google’s Gmail will warn users when they receive an authenticated message. Google’s Gmail is getting a new security update on Android and the web, where it will warn users if they receive a message with a dangerous or malicious link. Google’s App Security blog posted they will warn users if they receive a message that can’t be authenticated with Sender Policy Framework (SPF) or DKIM. Users’ will notice a question mark appear next to the sender’s profile photo, corporate logo or avatar, highlighting a potential risk. Google’s blogpost on the Gmail updates says, “On the web, if you receive a message with a link to a dangerous site known for phishing, malware, and Unwanted Software, you’ll begin to see warnings when you click on the link.” Google says these warnings are an extension of the Safe Browsing protection available to various web browsers today. However the blogpost also points out that not all affected email might be dangerous, but says it will still ask users to be extra careful when replying to links in messages where the authentication is not clear. Google says the initial rollout will be slow, but it will impact all users. Google has always taken user security seriously on Gmail, and had even stated it would start warning them about a potential attacks from governments. In 2014, Google announced it would use the encrypted HTTPs connection to make email safer for users. Gmail asks users to rely on two-step verification for better security and protection of their account, given it is linked to almost all Google services. In February this year, Google announced it will automatically encrypt all incoming and outgoing emails, if it could. Emails which are not encrypted have the broken lock symbol next to them, as emails can come from a service provider, which doesn’t support TLS encryption.

Credit: Jon Phillips More like this Multicore Python: A tough, worthy, and reachable goal What’s the buzz: Python gorges on tools and libraries Open source Java projects: Docker Swarm One after another, the arguments against using Python 3 in production keep dropping away. Yesterday, Google consigned another one to oblivion: "But there's no Python 3 support on Google App Engine!" Well, guess what? [ The InfoWorld review: 13 primo Python web frameworks. | 10 hard-core coding tips for faster Python. | Keep up with hot topics in programming with InfoWorld's Application Development newsletter. ] Google App Engine's Flexible Environment, which scales apps based on demand, has launched support for Python 3.4 as a beta-test offering. The runtimes for App Engine Flexible run as Docker containers, with the Dockerfiles available on GitHub. Developers can build the container locally, test their applications against it, then deploy the app alone to App Engine. It's also possible to customize the runtime, upload it as a Docker container to App Engine, and run the app in conjunction with it. Both Python 2.7 and Python 3.4 are available within the same container, so applications that need both versions of Python for whatever reason can access them both simultaneously. (Nuitka, for instance, uses some libraries that are not yet 3.x-compatible.) Google's support for Python in App Engine will continue to include Python 2.7, ostensibly for as long as that language is supported (until 2020). Now the bad news: Because Python 3.4 is the only supported version of Python 3, that means all the features in the language added in Python 3.5, like async/await, aren't available through App Engine's runtime. Developers can work around this by creating their own custom containers with the Python 3.5 runtime and executing them. The downside: You have to roll your own handling of some Google App Engine features, like health checks or start/stop requests.

The Federal Antimonopoly Service (FAS) in September last year deemed Google in breach of a law on "protecting competition" after an investigation following a complaint by Russia's largest search engine, Yandex. Yandex asked the antitrust authorities to prevent Android phones from being automatically bundled with Google's search engine. The FAS said that Google has two months to pay the fine. Yelena Zayeva, the head of its department for regulating communications and IT was quoted in the statement as saying the ruling "will allow the development of competition on the mobile software market in Russia, which will have a positive effect for consumers."All companies whose production is on sale in Russia have to observe the law on competition, "including transnational corporations," Zayeva added. Google said in a statement sent to AFP: "We have received notice of the fine from FAS and will analyze closely before deciding our next steps." "In the meantime, we continue to talk to all invested parties to help consumers, device manufacturers and developers thrive on Android in Russia," Google said. The tech giant's Android operating system dominates the smartphone market with a share of around 80 percent, which enables Google to offer search and other services to handset users. Russia's antitrust authority had been holding consultations with Google aimed at reaching an amicable agreement, but this required Google to admit guilt. Google has insisted that consumers are free to choose whether to use its services. Google has been hit by similar antitrust charges in other countries, particularly in the European Union, which has launched three cases against Google, one of which is specifically about using the dominance of the Android mobile phone operating system to restrict competition. Russia's anti-trust authority this week also launched legal proceedings against US tech giant Apple over the alleged fixing of resellers' prices for iPhones in the country. Apple said in a statement sent to AFP: "Resellers set their own prices for the Apple products they sell in Russia and around the world."

From time to time it pops up to the surface, giving us a hint of how Google will take everything it knows about you and create useful tools. The latest leaks reveal a new tab that appears at the bottom of the Google Now stream. In one of the shots it’s called Panel, while in the two others it’s referred to as Dashboard. Our best guess is it’ll be some type of tool to better organize your notes, calendar, and other upcoming events saved in your Google account. It could launch on Nexus and later come to other Android devices, but it’s hard to say at this point. The screenshots were acquired by someone running the leaked version of the Nexus Launcher, which may come exclusively to the upcoming Nexus phones. Despite loading this onto a Nexus 5X myself, I wasn’t able to make these appear.  You can always try it yourself with the APK, but be warned: it’s software that’s still in the development stage and probably wasn’t intended for use outside of Google’s testing environment. Why this matters: Google is aiming to make the next Nexus phones stand out with distinct software features.

The Nexus Sailfish was put through the test, which confirms some of its key specs.  ( Twitter ) Advertisement HTC is expected to build both of Google's upcoming Nexus smartphones, which will also serve as launch vehicles for Android 7.0 Nougat. One of those devices, the Nexus Sailfish has just shown itself on AnTuTu benchmarks. Over the last couple of years, some of the biggest smartphone makers have shifted to a two-device strategy when launching new smartphones. The move is essentially portrayed as providing greater choices for consumers, typically in the form of larger and smaller screens and higher and lower prices. In September 2013, Apple was among the first high profile smartphone makers to introduce two new handsets simultaneously. The iPhone 5s was the company's flagship smartphone and featured a premium design constructed out of aluminum and packed in the world's first 64-bit smartphone processor. While the iPhone 5c was marketed as a lower cost alternative with lower end specs and plastic case. Samsung's launch of the Galaxy Note 4 and Galaxy Note Edge in 2014, was Samsung's way of offering its customers a standard flat screen Galaxy Note or something a bit more radical, with the Galaxy Note Edge's curved display. This year, Samsung used a similar two-device strategy with the release of the Galaxy S7 and S7 edge, and while it was rumored to be testing both a flat and curved display Galaxy Note 7, only one of those devices made the cut, the curved screen variant. Google followed Apple and Samsung and launched two new smartphones with the release of the Nexus 6P and Nexus 5X in 2015. We've already reported numerous times, that Google is once again planning to launch a duo of new Nexus smartphones in the very near future. Google has reportedly partnered with HTC to build the smartphones, which are currently codenamed Marlin and Sailfish. We've recently seen renders of the new Nexus smartphones on video, make appearances on Geekbench, and now, the Nexus Sailfish has been spotted on AnTuTu Benchmark. According to the AnTuTu benchmark, which lists the smartphone as "Google Nexus Sailfish" and its rumored 5-inch display will sport a resolution of 1,920 x 1,080. In terms of power, the handset will include a Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 chip coupled with 4 GB of RAM. Its camera capabilities are listed as a 13-megapixel rear camera and 8-megapixel front-facing shooter. The AnTuTu benchmark also showed the Nexus Sailfish being tested included 32 GB of internal storage and of course was running Android 7.0 Nougat. Recent reports claim Google is planning to unveil its new Nexus smartphones in the near future, possibly in August. We'll keep you posted on any additional Nexus news as it becomes available.

Nexus Marlin: The new 2016 Google Nexus phone in a nutshell By Chris Barraclough 11th Aug 2016 Features Tweet Leaks have revealed that there will be two new Google Nexus phones in 2016, the Nexus Sailfish by HTC and a second mobile nicknamed the Nexus Marlin. Here's all you need to know about the Google Nexus Marlin, including rumoured specs, the possible launch date and more. What is the Nexus Marlin? Each year Google launches at least one own-brand Nexus mobile phone, which are always the first handsets to boast the latest version of Google's Android OS. This is always a vanilla version of Android, with none of the heavy overlays that a lot of mobiles come packing (such as the Samsung Galaxy S7, Sony's Xperia X and other big Android phones). Google doesn't actually design and manufacture these Nexus phones itself, however. For instance, the Nexus 5X and Nexus 6P from 2015 were built by LG and Huawei respectively. In 2016 it appears that HTC will be manufacturing at least one of the new Nexus phones, and most likely both - the Nexus Sailfish and the Nexus Marlin. The Nexus Marlin appears to be the more powerful of the two new 2016 Nexus handsets, boasting a bigger (5.5-inch), sharper display than the Sailfish as well as the very latest Snapdragon 821 processor. This means it will also be the more expensive Nexus 2016 phone. Read next: Nexus 5X vs Nexus 6P vs Nexus Marlin vs Nexus Sailfish What are the Nexus Marlin's specs? The Nexus Marlin hasn't been officially launched by Google, and so far all we have are rumoured specs: 5.5-inch Quad HD (2560x1440) screen Snapdragon 821 processor 12-megapixel rear camera 8-megapixel selfie camera 4GB RAM 32GB storage (microSD support uncertain) USB Type-C What features will the Nexus Marlin have? As with last year's 2015 Nexus phones, the Nexus Marlin will boast a rear-mounted fingerprint sensor for boosted security. You can also expect the funky new 'Night Light Mode', which like Apple's Night Shift mode makes the phone more comfortable to use in the evening. And of course you'll get all of the new Android Nougat features packed in there, before any other phone gets the update. Do we know the UK price and release date for the Nexus Marlin? Google hasn't officially announced the date of its next Nexus phone launch, but we're expecting the new Nexus Marlin and Sailfish handsets to be revealed in September 2016.

The search giant is testing a new “Dashboard” in Google Now, the personal assistant that offers contextually relevant information on Android. Multiple users have uploaded images and screen recordings with a new feature in Google Now — a Dashboard. The Google app looks the same as before except there’s a new bar at the bottom that offers the Google “Home” on the left, and the “Dashboard” on the right. Unfortunately, none of the images show what the Dashboard actually takes you to, but the “Home” is essentially the default Google Now homepage. Andrew Krause Related: Hands on with Android Nougat Developer Preview 5 One of the users who posted a screenshot of the new feature says “nothing appears” when he clicks Dashboard, meaning it’s likely not working. And it also seems to only show up when he’s using the Nexus Launcher, a proprietary launcher Google is bundling into Android Nougat for the upcoming Nexus devices. The buttons disappear when the user reverts back to the Google Now Launcher. The user, Andrew Krause, says he “made a calendar entry and a reminder in Keep and both appeared in the Dashboard. It seems to pull data from other Google services so that they are all available in one place.” Essentially if you use other Google services like Calendar, Inbox, and Maps, you’ll likely be able to see and act on notifications in the Dashboard. Related: Google Now tunnels deeper into your brain with upcoming Interests feature The APK for Google’s upcoming Nexus Launcher was unofficially leaked earlier this month; it seems like if you downloaded it you may be able to see this new Dashboard feature. That means Google may not have intended this feature to be seen yet, and it only affirms that the Nexus Launcher will bring proprietary features to Nexus devices only. This is not the only new feature the search giant is testing — a new “Explore Interests” feature recently began showing up for select users, allowing them to set specific categories and topics for Google Now to track.

But with commercial deployment still a way off, it’s also starting to look less than unique. The project’s chief technologist, Chris Urmson, departed last week, the latest in a parade of talent to abandon the effort, which began in 2009 inside the Google X lab—now called just X and a subsidiary of the Alphabet holding company created to separate Google’s core business from its other projects last year. Alphabet and others that invested early in autonomous driving, such as Tesla Motors, have seen senior staff leave as competitors ranging from large automakers to Apple to well-funded startups have built up serious autonomous-car projects of their own. “Others have been catching up to Alphabet; I wouldn’t say they’re running away with it anymore,” says Quin Garcia, managing director of Autotech Ventures, a Palo Alto investment firm focused on transportation startups. “Investors and corporations are willing to put big money into developing that technology.” Recent advances in machine learning have made it easier to cover ground that took Alphabet's project years, says Garcia. And experienced engineers such as Urmson can be sure of strong backing even if they decide to go it alone, he says. (Urmson said in a blog post last week that he doesn’t have a new project lined up.) The $581 million General Motors spent earlier this year to acquire Cruise, a startup working on automated driving, has stoked confidence among entrepreneurs and investors that competing with Alphabet can be viable. One founding member of Google’s original autonomous-driving project, Anthony Levandowski, left the company in January. In May he launched Otto, a San Francisco startup working on autonomous driving for trucks. The company has already modified trucks to drive themselves in tests on California freeways. Otto has more than 60 employees, according to LinkedIn, including several veterans of Alphabet’s and Tesla’s autonomous-driving teams. Alphabet’s other competition includes Zoox, a startup based in Menlo Park, California, that is working on an autonomous vehicle intended to be used for a driverless taxi service. A June filing shows that Zoox has received $100 million in funding, and Business Insider reports it is set to double that figure. One reason investors are backing self-driving startups is a belief that despite Alphabet’s early lead, the company is not well positioned to commercialize the technology. The project’s leaders have said they are only interested in cars that can handle every type of driving without human supervision. To that end, they are developing cars that lack steering wheels and brake pedals for a human to ever use. And Alphabet wants to license its technology to a car manufacturer rather than make cars itself. Last year the former head of Hyundai’s American division, John Krafcik, was appointed as the project’s CEO. That strategy faces two big challenges, says Robert Seidl, managing director at Motus Ventures, an early-stage venture capital firm focused on transportation. For one, “car companies don’t trust Google,” he says. “They don’t want to be left just bending metal and getting the low-margin part of the business.” And second, says Seidl, neither Alphabet nor the automakers are in a good position to launch a fleet of robotic taxis, which he and other investors argue would be the most plausible way to make money with fully autonomous vehicles. An on-demand ride service could quickly recoup the cost of developing and manufacturing the cars by putting them to work for many hours a day, says Seidl. A robot car service could also be viable even if its vehicles were limited to operating in a certain area, he says. Autonomous vehicles rely heavily on detailed 3-D maps that must be kept up to date, so releasing a consumer car capable of driving anywhere would be a big challenge. Urmson said at MIT Technology Review’s EmTech Digital conference in May that he expected Alphabet's vehicles to come to certain urban pockets first. Shahin Farshchi, a partner at the venture firm Lux Capital in Menlo Park, which invested in Zoox, says that neither a company built around answering Web searches nor one that specializes in selling cars for private use is likely to build out a good transportation service. “The notion of Toyota and Honda going into the autonomous-transport business is like saying Boeing and Airbus are going to be effective as airlines,” says Farshchi. (GM’s decision to invest $500 million into Uber competitor Lyft and work on a trial of self-driving ride service could be recognition of that challenge; Alphabet has a stake in Uber, but the ride-sharing company is aggressively pursuing its own self-driving technology.) By insisting on waiting until fully autonomous passenger vehicles are ready, Alphabet could also miss a chance to capitalize on the early years of the technology’s emergence. Meanwhile, other companies could make money from selling self-driving technology for, say, highway driving, which is simple compared with getting a vehicle to cope with complex urban situations (see “Driverless Cars Are Further Away Than You Think”). Other companies, including Otto and Tesla, believe it’s possible to offer automated features for private or commercial driving—features that work only some of the time. Urmson has been a vocal critic of the idea that partial automation is safe, saying that Google employees loaned self-driving prototypes in 2012 quickly became dangerously trusting of them (see “Lazy Humans Shaped Google’s New Autonomous Car”). He has also said Alphabet’s project is closer to being road-ready than some may think. At EmTech Digital in May he repeated his frequent claim that he was aiming to make it unnecessary for his son to get a driver’s license. That would mean Alphabet’s cars will hit the road in 2020. Whether he still believes that, or whether those cars will have to share the road with other self-driving vehicles created with Urmson’s help, is unclear.

Russia fines Google $6.7 million over anti-trust charge AFP 11/08/2016 © Provided by AFP Russia's largest search engine Yandex asked anti-trust authorities to prevent Android phones from being automatically bundled with Google's search engine Russia's anti-trust authority on Thursday fined Google 438 million rubles ($6.75 million) after finding it guilty of abusing its dominant market position by forcing smartphone makers to install its search engine on Androids. The Federal Antimonopoly Service (FAS) in September last year deemed Google in breach of a law on "protecting competition" after an investigation following a complaint by Russia's largest search engine, Yandex. Yandex asked the anti-trust authorities to prevent Android phones from being automatically bundled with Google's search engine. The FAS said that Google has two months to pay the fine. Yelena Zayeva, the head of its department for regulating communications and IT was quoted in the statement as saying the ruling "will allow the development of competition on the mobile software market in Russia, which will have a positive effect for consumers." All companies whose production is on sale in Russia have to observe the law on competition, "including transnational corporations," Zayeva added. Google said in a statement sent to AFP: "We have received notice of the fine from FAS and will analyze closely before deciding our next steps." "In the meantime, we continue to talk to all invested parties to help consumers, device manufacturers and developers thrive on Android in Russia," Google said. The tech giant's Android operating system dominates the smartphone market with a share of around 80 percent, which enables Google to offer search and other services to handset users. Russia's anti-trust authority had been holding consultations with Google aimed at reaching an amicable agreement, but this required Google to admit guilt. Google has insisted that consumers are free to choose whether to use its services. Google has been hit by similar anti-trust charges in other countries, particularly in the European Union, which has launched three cases against Google, one of which is specifically about using the dominance of the Android mobile phone operating system to restrict competition. Russia's anti-trust authority this week also launched legal proceedings against US tech giant Apple over the alleged fixing of resellers' prices for iPhones in the country. Apple said in a statement sent to AFP: "Resellers set their own prices for the Apple products they sell in Russia and around the world."

Russia’s Federal Anti-monopoly Service (FAS) ruled last year that Google is “abusing” its position in the mobile market after a six-month investigation following a complaint from Yandex, the country’s largest search engine and Google rival. Google is facing the same charge from European regulators, who say that requiring manufacturers to pre-install Search on Android devices as a condition to license certain Google apps breaches antitrust rules. Google appealed against the ruling in March, but Moscow’s arbitration court stood by the FAS decision. A FAS representative said the fine was determined as a share of Google Play’s domestic sales in Russia. Local rules stipulate that fines represent 1 to 15 percent of a violator's revenue - from 2014, in this instance - but what percentage Google will have to hand over is unknown. Google now has two months to pay the fine. It has also been ordered to change its agreements with device makers. In a statement to Reuters, the company’s press service said: "We have received a notification from FAS about the imposed fine. We will familiarize ourselves with the ruling before deciding on further actions. In the meantime, we continue to talk to all invested parties to help consumers, device manufacturers and developers thrive on Android in Russia." Google isn’t the only US tech firm facing antitrust charges in Russia. The FAS is investigating Apple over allegations the Cupertino company may have been involved in fixing prices for iPhones - something it says is left up to Russian resellers.

The antitrust watchdog has recently completed a probe into whether Google has increased its market share through its preinstalled mapping and search apps. The European Union is also conducting investigations into similar charges.  “Google has preinstalled its own apps on Android devices as it does in Europe. But the results were totally different,” an FTC official was quoted as saying by a local news daily. “Despite the preinstalled apps, most Korean users download their preferred apps such as Naver. Considering the minor impact in the market, there is no good reason to charge Google here.” In the nation’s search engine market, Google’s market share remained at 2 to 8 percent since its entry in 2008, which compared to Naver’s 70 percent and Kakao’s 15 to 19 percent. In the meantime, Google recently offered its opposition to a legal revision to uninstall its preloaded apps through the American Chamber of Commerce in Korea. The planned revision aims to allow users to remove the preloaded apps they don’t need. Following government guidelines announced in 2014, local handset manufacturers and telecom carriers are making their preinstalled apps removable but foreign companies such as Google and Apple still resist following the rules that are not legally binding.

REUTERS/Eric Gaillard/Illustration/File PhotoMore SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's antitrust regulator said on Friday it is looking into whether Google has violated the country's anticompetition laws, acknowledging formal scrutiny of the global internet search company for the first time. The Korea Fair Trade Commission (KFTC) disclosed the investigation in a brief statement, without commenting on the nature of the probe nor any potential antitrust violations. A person familiar with the matter told Reuters last month the KFTC inspected Google's Seoul headquarters in July. The antitrust body's statement came after a local media report said the KFTC had decided to clear Google of anticompetition charges involving the pre-loading of the company's apps on smartphones running on the Android operating system. Google, whose corporate parent is Alphabet Inc , declined to comment. While it wasn't clear whether the probe would lead to any formal charges, the investigation opens another regulatory front for Google. The firm was fined $6.8 million in Russia on Thursday and faces multiple European Union antitrust charges. The KFTC has investigated Google before. In 2013, the regulator cleared Google of wrongdoing following a probe into whether the company hurt competition by forcing smartphone makers using Android to pre-load its search engine on the handsets.

Follow TechnoBuffalo Google Fiber is gearing up to expand beyond fiber-optic cable in a big way. A new filing with the FCC reveals plans to test its experimental wireless service in up to 24 U.S. locations, potentially removing the need for a physical hookup. The filing notes that Google would spend two years testing the service, though it wouldn’t be available for consumer use. Instead, the wireless internet would be limited to employees and “trusted testers. The company is already experimenting with similar technology in Kansas City, which was the first city to get Google Fiber. “We are working to test the viability of a wireless network that relies on newly available spectrum,” a Google Fiber spokesperson told Business Insider. “The project is in early stages today, but we hope this technology can one day help deliver more abundant Internet access to consumers.” Google Fiber’s original plan to install fiber-optic cables in cities and towns along the country is still chugging along, but it’s a slow and complicated process. Switching to wireless would make it a lot easier to expand quickly, and the company may have even delayed launch plans in two Silicon Valley cities to focus on the new strategy instead. If this pays off, we could see Google Fiber start to reach new cities a lot faster within the next few years.

Both guests suggest that Google, the world's top search engine, could proactively direct voter preferences using what they have labeled a Search Engine Manipulation Effect (SEME). According to Epstein, SEME is a means by which search results can be reshuffled in a manner that favors one or another candidate, or one or another viewpoint, perhaps depending on Google's views on who is best for the US or for the company. Epstein claims that SEME could shift political preferences up to 20 percent among undecided voters. The existence of SEME is explained in research described by Epstein in a 2015 article in Politico. He describes an experiment involving some 4,500 participants in two countries and a simulated search engine he called Kadoodle. © Photo: Pixabay Russian Antimonopoly Service Imposes $6.7Mln Fine on Google for Market Violations Kadoodle imitates Google search techniques, with a limited number of pre-selected results, in the form of actual web pages downloaded prior to the study. During the study, one group of participants were given search results arranged in a manner that favored candidate A in the first pages of search results and candidate B on later pages. Another group of participants received search results arranged in the reverse. Researchers recorded participants' views toward the candidates before and after the experiment and discovered that most participants from both groups shifted their opinion toward candidates in accordance with the candidate favored by the first page. Epstein argues that search engines, including Google, could manipulate result rankings so that a candidate favored by the search engine will receive higher rankings. David Ahmad, president of Subgraph, an open source tech security company, adds that people contribute to the notion of search engine influence by freely providing an enormous amount of personal information to Google through its free services — precisely the kind of data people are reluctant to provide to the government, in the form of the NSA. This is true not only for individual users, but for companies and hospitals that have mostly abandoned the practice of running their own servers, in favor of Google's free options. © AP Photo/ Keystone, Walter Bier, file Force Majeure: Tech Giants Compel Jihadists Watch Anti-terrorist Cartoons According to Ahmad, Google's public relations department does a great job of convincing people that it "does no evil." That Google services are free propagates this sentiment, he notes. According to Epstein, since President Barack Obama took office, at least 250 people have changed top seats in the US administration for top seats in Google, some performing the jump multiple times. Google employees have made over 450 visits to the White house, much more than any other corporation, Epstein notes. Epstein states that the line between a corporations and government has become blurred. This is, he suggests, because the Google search engine has been partly funded by US intelligence agencies so as to create a "gateway" to the internet that simplifies the tracking of people and organizations, Epstein claims. © Flickr/ Kevin Harber Amazon Chairman to Join Google Chief on US Defense Innovation Board Currently it cannot be proven either way, whether Google does or does not manipulate, or, at the least, have the power to manipulate, electoral results. Google has acknowledged that it modifies its search algorithms some 600 times per year, but the exact process is secret. According to the company's official stance on search result manipulation: "Providing relevant answers has been the cornerstone of Google's approach to search from the very beginning. It would undermine the people's trust in our results and company if we were to change course." Google's official non-answer is a bit of public relations theater any spook can appreciate. ...

Many experts believe Google uses a score called Page Rank to prioritize search lists. Page Rank ranges from 1 to 10 for most websites. However, sites Google wishes to penalize are assigned a Page Rank zero. Many pro-Russian or alternate websites have a Page Rank of zero, including, yes, Sputnik, but also The Saker, TASS, David Stockman and many more. Our best news sources are suppressed. And these sources are more likely to favor Trump.

This is why it is important to check who the sender of the email is, and if you don’t know who they are, it’s probably a bad idea to download any of its attachments. So far Google has been doing a stellar job at protecting its users, but there’s always room for improvement. In a post on Google’s blog, the company revealed new security measures that they have implemented to make sure that Gmail is safe for its users. One of those methods is by showing users who are authenticated and users who aren’t. Those who aren’t will have a question mark in place of their profile photo, meaning that this is someone whose profile is unauthenticated. Google will also introduce warning messages when emails come with embedded links. If the links are deemed to be dangerous and are leading to phishing or malware-ladden websites, Google will display a warning message to tell users not to proceed and will prevent the page from loading completely. However Google does note that not all flagged emails are potentially dangerous. We’re sure on more than one occasion you might have emails sent from friends, family members, work, or your bank that have accidentally ended up in your spam folder, but either way just to be safe, just double check it all the same.

 The 3 different ways Larry Page's company invests money Jillian D'Onfro Aug. 11, 2016, 9:11 PM 6,414 facebook linkedin twitter email print Larry Page, cofounder of Google and CEO of Alphabet. Ethan Miller/Getty Images Google parent company Alphabet throws around a lot of money. There are three ways that the about $550 billion behemoth invests: 1. Through the venture-capital arm GV, which has $2.4 billion under management and more than 300 companies invested in, including Nest, Uber, Slack, and Flatiron Health. Its mission is to invest in early-stage startups and it works like a regular venture-capital firm with one limited partner. It ostensibly operates completely independently from the rest of Alphabet and doesn't pick investments that strategically benefit its parent company. Sometimes, its investments even compete with Alphabet efforts — like Uber, which GV invested in in 2013, which, like Alphabet, is working on self-driving cars. Bill Maris, who founded the firm in 2009, is stepping down this week, ceding leadership to David Krane, a managing partner who first joined Google in 2000. 2. Through the growth equity investment fund Google Capital, which has invested in the likes of Glassdoor, Thumbtack, Gusto, and, recently, its first public company, Care.com. David Lawee leads the group, which was founded in 2013. Google Capital is similar to GV in that its investments are not directly connected to Google's objectives and its mission is purely financial returns. But it does put more of an emphasis on offering portfolio companies access to Google people and resources and focuses on later-stage startups than GV. Which brings us to the last investing vehicle: 3. Through the company's core M&A team, which serves all of Alphabet. This team invests strategically in companies that are relevant to Google's and Alphabet's efforts. For example, Google poured money into secretive augmented-reality startup Magic Leap and Google CEO Sundar Pichai serves on its board while it plugs away on its own VR efforts. It also invested in SpaceX, which is working satellites that are tangential to Google's plans to beam low-cost internet across the globe. Some of the companies Google invested in have become their own spinoff Alphabet subsidiaries, like Calico and Sidewalk Labs. Sound confusing? Meanwhile, Larry Page is making personal investments in flying cars, and Google is supporting internal business efforts through a new incubator called Area 120. Here's an interesting look at the number of new deals from GV, Google Capital, and Google/Alphabet since 2013, from CB Insights: Google SEE ALSO: A year ago, Google blew itself up to become Alphabet, and a lot has changed since then ...
