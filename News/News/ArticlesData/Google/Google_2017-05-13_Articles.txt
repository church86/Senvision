By Brandon Butler Senior Editor, Network World | May 9, 2017 12:52 PM PT Credit: Network World Related Zix wins 5-vendor email encryption shootout Stratoscale shows you how to run your own Amazon 'region' How Google and Amazon think about multi-cloud workloads Video What is serverless computing? Infamous government hacker Edward Snowden believes open source is a fundamentally better way to use technology compared to proprietary technology that he believes disempowers users. Snowden was interviewed at the open source cloud computing project OpenStack Summit in Boston via video from a non-descript location and spoke about his personal use of open source technology. In 2013 Snowden, then a government contractor, leaked classified information about government surveillance programs run by the National Security Agency, which brought him worldwide fame. +MORE AT NETWORK WORLD: Deep dive comparison of Amazon, Microsoft and Google cloud storage + Speaking specifically about cloud computing technology, Snowden said clouds from Amazon and Google are fine, but noted that customers using these products are “sinking costs into an infrastructure that is not yours… you’re investing into things you don’t control or shape.” Snowden raised the question: “When you’re running things in Google’s cloud, Amazon’s cloud, how do you know when you’re being spied on?” Whether its happening legally or illegally, Snowden argues these vendors could use customers’ information “at a layer that’s hidden from you.” There have been no credible reports of cloud vendors spying on customers. Snowden encouraged attendees of the OpenStack Summit to “direct the future of the internet in a more free and fair way.” One way to do that, he says, is to use open source tools to build computing platforms that customers build and host themselves, which gives users more control over how data is handled. Amazon Web Services explains on the Data Privacy section of its website that customers control their own data. “Customers maintain ownership of their customer content and select which AWS services process, store and host their customer content. We do not access or use customer content for any purpose other than as legally required and for maintaining the AWS services and providing them to our customers and their end users,” the site states. “We never use customer content or derive information from it for marketing or advertising.” Cloud vendors also offer a variety of ways that customers can encrypt data stored in the public cloud, including offering customers the ability to hold their own keys to the encryption. Snowden is also worried about data privacy when it comes to smartphones and other technologies. “All systems should be designed to obey the user, they should not deceive or lie to the user. They shouldn't hide from the user,” he said. Snowden said he’s working on open source code projects that allow users to verify the status of their phones, for example, to ensure that when WiFi or networking features are disabled that they truly are. Snowden said he used a variety of open source tools to facilitate his 2013 leaking of thousands of classified government documents, including the Debian open source operating system and the Tor Project, which helps protect users anonymity. Snowden has been charged with espionage and theft of government property by U.S. authorities. He’s currently in asylum in Russia.

Netflix confirms it is blocking rooted/unlocked devices, app itself is still working (for now) Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/05/13 3:08pm PDTMay 13, 2017 127 Plus 1 on G+ 452 Share on Facebook 161 Share on Twitter Total Shares740 Applications News Earlier today, Netflix started showing up as 'incompatible' on the Play Store for rooted and unlocked Android devices. However, the app itself continued to work fine, leading some (including myself) to think it could have been an accident. However, Netflix has now confirmed to us that blocking modified devices from downloading the app was intentional. This is the full statement: With our latest 5.0 release, we now fully rely on the Widevine DRM provided by Google; therefore, many devices that are not Google-certified or have been altered will no longer work with our latest app and those users will no longer see the Netflix app in the Play Store. If you're not familiar with it, Widevine is a Google-made DRM technology that works across various desktop and mobile platforms. Widevine categorizes devices into three security levels, ranging from all processes running in the Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) to not running anything in TEE at all. However, the Play Store listing seems tied to a device's SaftetyNet status (which is used by Android Pay), rather than the Widevine TEE. For example, Artem's bootloader-unlocked stock Pixel is still on Widevine Level 1, the most secure level, but fails SafetyNet because it is unlocked. The update's changelog also confirms the: "Version 5.0 only works with devices that are certified by Google and meet all Android requirements." What isn't exactly clear is why only the Play store listing is blocked, but the app itself continued to function normally. I tried both Netflix 4.16 and 5.0.4 (the latest version, from today), and both worked without problems on my unlocked and rooted Galaxy Tab S (which is labeled as Widevine Security Level 3). Maybe at some point the app will stop working, but that does not appear to be the case right now. If you have a blocked device, I recommend following the Pushbullet channel for Netflix on APKMirror (click the Pushbullet button on that page) so you can continue to receive updates outside the Play Store.

First the vpn's now this... why oh why??? Jimk4003 Surely because licensing is regionally specific, and because rooting has the potential to defeat DRM. I get that it might be annoying for some people, but aren't the reasons obvious? David Juarez But root?? Lol Semianonymous Probably an effort to reduce Region spoofing? Idk how easy that is to do on a stock device. Jimk4003 Because rooting has the potential to defeat DRM. mjh49783ab DRM doesn't work. All DRM does is inconvenience the end user. Jimk4003 Possibly. But Netflix have to negotiate licencing deals with the movie studios, and having DRM helps reassure the studios that the movies they have spent millions of dollars making aren't going to get stolen off Netflix without any attempt to stop it. mjh49783ab One could make the argument that rooting the phone may compromise the DRM. But blocking users from unlocking their phones to switch carriers? That is total bullshit, and is just the sort of thing that encourages users to pirate the content. Jimk4003 Netflix are blocking you from switching carriers? lomsha Sim unlocked phones are fine, unlocked bootloaders are blocked. h4rr4r The studios need to reconsider blu rays then. Way easier to rip. Nothing they do will stop piracy. This kind of thing actually encourages it. Jimk4003 Maybe studios do need to consider Blu-ray's. That isn't Netflix's problem though. h4rr4r No Netflix problem is making sure they don't let the studios reduce the value of their product. If Amazon video works on my devices and Netflix does not that is a big deal to me. In that case I might as well sign up for more addon channels on Amazon with the mkney that currently goes to Netflix. Jimk4003 Agreed. But the studios are responsible for making the product they redistribute. It's certainly a balancing act, and I can see both sides of the argument, but Netflix isn't an inalienable right, and those who don't meet the T&C's are going to miss out. h4rr4r Sure, but the studios and Netflix are going to create pirates with these kind of actions. People aren't going to miss out. They will just pirate what they can't get legally. Doby Gillis whaa fucking whaa. Sergio Carmona The only obvious thing here is your sarcasm detector not working properly. Go have it fixed please. Jimk4003 Nah, I'm good. h4rr4r So the reason are to make the product worse for the consumer. Great idea, now piracy looks better and better. Jimk4003 What percentage of phones are rooted though? Most people won't care, or even notice the change. h4rr4r It does not matter, if it drives even one person to piracy that is a loss. Jimk4003 But if they can ensure better licensing deals via these new terms, which will attract more customers at the expense of a few rooted users who make up a tiny fraction of overall users; will Netflix care about that loss? h4rr4r But if it encourages piracy the other side of the contract should want to avoid it. Gaining customers in the short term like this hurts the whole market in the long term. Cyber_Akuma Because yeah, people are going to rip movies from Netflix and not off a Blu-Ray.... and even IF they were to attempt to rip them off Netflix, they would use a PHONE and not a PC.... Lord Argyris Looks like I'll have to start updating manually then. Or just not bother with the app at all since I rarely use Netflix on my phone as it is. SpasilliumNexus Thank goodness the 3T's Open Beta of OxygenOS is good enough for me to not unlock my device and stick with complete stock. Now I wonder why I haven't received any Netflix app updates beyond 4.16.1 build 15145 on the Play Store, when APKMirror has 4 newer versions. Φώτης Because unlocking your Android powered device is such a "bad" thing to do. Whatever Netflix. Ailín Ó’S Ναι, ακριβώς... 😑 C64 How about some English Rob Google translate says that "Ναι, ακριβώς" translates to "Yes, exactly". pcriz How about some Google translate :-/ asianrage Is it being Unlocked that is not allowed, or Unlocked and Rooted as well? Corbin Davenport Both. Artem can't install it on his unlocked Google Pixel XL. h4rr4r Huh? He can install it, just not from the play store. Apk mirror, soon back answer. Corbin Davenport Yes, that's what I meant. It doesn't appear on the Play Store for him. asianrage That's so shitty. lomsha Idiotic. Andreaeritzman Google is paying 97$ per hour! Work for few hours & have longer with friends and family! !sf93c: On tuesday I got a great new Land Rover Range Rover from having earned $8752 this last four weeks.. Its the most-financialy rewarding I've had.. Follow this link for more information !sf93c: ➽➽ ➽➽;➽➽ http://GoogleFinancialCashJobs383TopNovaGetPaid$97/Hour... ★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫::::::!sf93c:....,..... _jack_ I will send them feedback about this. nagi Just another step that makes pirating the same content more convenient... we should really be going the other way if they ever want piracy to be reduced. lomsha Funny thing is their content is available to stream all over the internet. Don't see how this move fights piracy as long as computers have access. This just alienates legit users who are doing nothing nefarious on unlocked/rooted devices. Richard Branches By one everybody pays... Pathum Addarapathirana Dude I root my phone to just get iPhone emojis and to tether without my carrier knowing. Like I'm not stealing anything this will just make me stop paying for Netflix. Latheryin Just a heads up. Those treating hiding mods are fake. There is no way to hide if from the carrier. Heck if they wanted to they could see every web page you load from a ton of different places and ways. Yan Minari That’s why god invented VPN Latheryin Yes but even then it doesn't block everything. qqqqqq My provider absolutely blocks tethering - I've been using various methods, including VPNs, to block it for literally YEARS... Hasn't been difficult. Dylan Harris That's not true. All you have to due to bypass tethering limits on t-mobile is to change the TTL on the tethered device. Latheryin That just gets by the automated checks. Get a live person to randomly pick your account (not really likely but happens) and it is not had to tell if someone is tethering. Android Developer Is the tether solution needed even if you do it using USB ? Fulbring What a stupid move. I pay for the premium for Netflix and I never thought that I might have to cancel my service just because they did this. The only reason why I have root is because of AdAway and TitaniumBackup. I still use the stock OnePlus 3T ROM. Wasn't expecting this at all.... Kinda suck. Will be interesting to see how many customers they lose. Julian Berger Not enough to change it back... 4Ui812 DRM has no place in our lives. I suspect Netflix will have a change of heart within 6 months. Branko Xiaomi phones say bye bye to Netflix. Google go fuck yourselves. Steve_Jobroni Go fucking buy a windows phone. 天地人 Seriously though Windows phones are great. The only problem with them is the lack of applications. Otherwise, it runs great on low-end hardware, has a great UI, the homescreen is innovative, synchronisation with Windows PCs is cool, etc. Jimk4003 This is Netflix, not Google. Cyber_Akuma Google invented this SafetyNet crap, let anyone use it for any reason (Hell, Pokemon GO of all things started using it), and over the last year have been making it even more and more strict and unforgiving. So no, a HUGE part of the blame does lie on Google for being openly hostile towards rooted users and not giving a damn about them. blindexecutioner So the solution is to install from outside the play store. That's great for security. Way to go. Richard Markert No they don't. Since Windows 7, new and default users are not Admin accounts. koiulpoi Sorry, this is absolutely wrong. The first user created on a Windows PC has full administrative access, limited by UAC. You can still delete System32, it's just mildly harder than it used to be. If "new and default users" were not Admin accounts, they couldn't install software, so... TechGuy22 Haha kodi Doesn't matter to me I Stopped paying for Netflix long time ago. C64 Haha Teranium TV 😎 TechGuy22 I like that too. You can even get the mod one and remove the ads. Lol C64 I know, i always use those. I want to pay for the dev, but there's no option to do that. Koko time is coming with a big update to tim242 Thief. Renato Santos This is stupid. Congratulations, Netflix. Jan-Lk Else It is also getting more and more necessary to unlock / root devices due to missing updates etc. But I'm not a Netflix customer and won't become one. C64 Whahaha, this has to be the most retarded move of the year in any category (even Trump can't top this). I'm glad i don't use Old Crap Flix. A Person Hillary, then Netflix. C64 Nope sorry. Since Trump is your president i can't take America serious anymore A Person Timeout, you're not even a US citizen? No interest in your opinion. Roy Riddex Just so I'm clear on this, by unlocked are we talking about SIM unlocked? lomsha No no, unlocked bootloader. Roy Riddex Thanks Corbin Davenport Unlocked bootloader. pbergonzi I wonder how long they'll stick with that premise seeing as how much public opinion expressed here is against them. Screw them. Get the APK somewhere else or install magisk and hide your root. Too many people root their devices and have a good reason for doing so and Netflix should not penalize them. Doby Gillis Dude, normal people don't give a fuck about rooted phones. It's just the elitist twats who do it anymore. twiz0r Dude, you're an elitist twat. Richard Markert Most people who root seem to be. The sentiment among rooters is "if you don't root your phone, you're not as good as me and don't deserve to have a phone. Root you stupid noob!" twiz0r thanks for confirming your twatness. good day. C64 One word ..... Bullshit Corey Kinard I've yet to see that... Maybe you just feel like that because they do in fact know more than you? Jimk4003 I'm sure Netflix are terrified that the tiny fraction of Android users who come to this site, and the similarly tiny fraction who root their phones, are bothered. The rest of the world won't care. C64 Probably 90 % of the people don't know what root is. Almost every person I know owns an Android device, but i'm the only geek who flashes and roots his devices pbergonzi Judging from the posts here it looks like nobody who roots their phone uses Netflix anyway so I guess it's moot. But the outcry sure did get them a bunch of free publicity. T4rd This is what Magisk is for. Pretty sure if I can still use Android Pay with my rooted 6P, I can still use/update Netflix through the Play Store. Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ Magisk still requires that you unlock your bootloader, which is enough to trigger safety net these days, so that won't work. TechGuy22 You don't know how magisk works do you Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ I understand that Magisk is a great tool for modifying my system without actually modifying it. I understand that there are many modules that allow you to do things like hide root, bypass security modules, skin your system, and plenty of other things. What I don't understand is how you can install magisk without unlocking your bootloader. Back when I originally tried it out with pokemon go, it worked well for a while, but eventually even just having my bootloader unlocked was all it took to throw SafetyNet. If that's not an issue anymore, then great! But maybe say that instead of being snarky. Thomas Gladdines Bootloader can be simply locked after rooting and installing a custom recovery. Edwin O. Lol no You could, but then you can't flash anything with said recovery... So no point Muzzy996 Well as an example for the Google Pixel: https://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=71901761&postcount=454 In this case all it takes is a kernel that supports Magisk and hides the fact that the bootloader is unlocked, at which point with Magisk Hide enabled all root and SafetyNet checks pass. Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ Excellent. I'll have to look back into this then, last time I used magisk it wasn't as capable, glad to see it's come this far. sbeaulieu Magical Hide is there for that Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ Can Magical Hide hide that my bootloader is unlocked? Serious question, not being sarcastic or snarky as I was below. sbeaulieu It does make the SafetyNet check pass T4rd Except it's working for me right now... jonzey231 This has been happening for a week now. I tweeted it to Ruddock a few days ago. Just didn't put together that it was because I was unlocked. https://twitter.com/jonzey231/status/862122438125072384 steelew Google really needs to start stealing from the root community the way apple takes from the jailbreak community. It feels like rooting is way down except for a few (legal) use cases. If it weren't for visual tweaks & usability tweaks, I would have no need to root (personally). This kind of stuff starts to make rooting unpleasant. I already can't use fingerprint auth in my banking app any more because root. Jesús Cuenca They do. I used rooms for like 8 years maybe? And a lot of the "new features" always come of the rom or root comunity. Right now i use roms, but not root. Marcelove I'm trying to stay indoors, but is complicate... Greenify for example, works at no root devices nowadays... But is way better with root and Xposed... Doze can't compare against Greenify... Maybe at version number 20 root wouldn't be necessary... Sandeep Raghuraman What about the version downloaded from Amazon app store though? Does that work fine? TwoBit Gary It worked, but it is old version without show downloads. Go to apkmirror oculairmedia Interesting move. I flashed a custom ROM on my Nexus 6 because stock was so slow that it was getting unusable, but screw me right ? Atoqir In my country lots of stuff doesn't work on unrooted devices. My bank app, payment app and local cable TV and digicorder app all stopped working. Also s-health doesn't work anymore and soon Netflix. Time to unroot Marcelove "Time to unroot" Sheep. Richard Markert Rooting is insecure. You don't need to access the system partition except to break things. Benjamin Walburn If that were the case then this wouldn't be an issue. Nobody is looking to break their phone. Richard Markert Few people I've talked to online know what they're doing when it comes to root. Most of those end up breaking things. Rooting is far too easy and probably shouldn't exist at all. Benjamin Walburn You could say the same about anything, not just modification of phones. Maybe you shouldn't own a car if you can't fix it yourself, or have kids if you aren't a doctor. Rooting isn't easy, it's made easy by the hard work of other people. It's not up to you what other people do with their property, you have no right to say that they shouldn't. And if someone breaks their phone, what does it have to do with you? It's their hobby and their phone. You're not their daddy. senoredusty Or use Magisk DJMix No need. You could use magisk su hide for the moment. it still passes the safetynet. I too use a banking app that cannot be used on normal root proocess faceless128 "please stop giving us money and use Kodi instead" Sounds like a great business plan! JD For the sake of Kodi's developers don't say Kodi in that context. ericshmerick Hrmm, every time I hear Kodi, I think of pirated content. Guess when people are like "I use Kodi for my 30TB media collection" I stop and wonder how... Yes, ripping a lifetime of DVDs, but nah. Probably piracy. C64 I know a few how really use it legally Powsniffer0110 Yea I use it legally 95% of the time. Mike Honestly though, if pirate add-ons wern't available on kodi, 98% of the people using it now would not have even heard of it before. Even bad publicity is good publicity. They are not going to publicly come out and say it, but the add-on's are the only reason they're well known. cbstryker Kodi is just an open source media player. To watch any pirated content you either need to download it or install an unaffiliated plugin that streams from pirated sources. C64 Next kodi wil have drm build in. So people have to use forks. I stopped using kodi since i found Teranium TV. cbstryker That makes zero sense. Kodi's reason for existing would stop. Justin D Same...but with Plex and something else >.> Dmitry Stepanushkin Xposed + RootCloak or something similar will do it for most of apps for those who need root. So I think not a big problem. Abhishek Saral Not a big problem but a big annoyance. tehboogieman Hmm, rootcloak isn't working for me with netflix m477 No, it won't work. Safetynet always fails if you have closed activated, or if you just have an unlocked bootloader. Sometimes even by just having adb debugging turned on. Kan☆n MagiskSU and its manager app comes with a very good hider built-in. No Xposed needed. h4rr4r Beyond pointless. Netflix won by being easier than piracy, this threatens to turn back the clock on that. Marcelove Funny thing: I was about to become a subscriber of Netflix after seeing House of Cards by PirateBay but now through the official channel because I thought that Netflix deserved my money... Look : deservED... But this movie will keep me at PirateBay... Funny thing 2: I have a Moto G5 that I could unlock and root and I didn't it just because I wanna see how things are nowadays without root... And I use a lot of apps that would work better with root (Greenify for example)... So I would be able to use Netflix... And I won't and will stay that way only because this douchebag move... Congratulations Netflix... Funny thing 3: So happy that I waited till House of Cards release to become a subscriber... Netflix should learn something from Frank Underwood... And from Blockbuster... tim242 Yeah, sure you were. Once a thief, always a thief. koiulpoi This is the most untrue statement I've read on this website. Thomas Elephants can fly 天地人 http://gadling.com/2012/06/10/airline-transports-herd-of-african-elephants-photos/ 天地人 Yes, because illegally pirating from huge corperations which constantly attempt to and successfully brainwash people into agenda using various tricks, is somehow bad? You're not supporting the creators of the show, sure. But you're also not supporting the 6 Jewish companies that control 90% of American media. Anyways, with your little money you wouldn't be benefitting anybody. Do you honestly think those Jewish companies are dying to get a hold of your $120 you payed for Netflix this year? Probably not. The creators of the show, are well off anyways. Don't companies pay them to have their content on their platform and pay for their production cost and wages? Then; they've already been payed. I'm not endorsing piracy. It isn't the best thing to do, but I think calling people a "thief" and grouping them with people who have actually stolen things off individuals which mean a lot to the individual and murdered some individuals in the process, is just stupid. It's not the same as 'stealing' bits of 1s and 0s. Again, I'm not endorsing piracy, however there are a lot of good reasons to pirate movies and TV shows. Trysta Noticed this a little while ago. The crazy thing is I'm not even rooted or interested in any mods. I needed to sideload the latest version 7.1.2 because my RMA Nexus 6p refused to update on its own. I'm keeping the bootloader unlocked so I can recover if my phone boot loops. I rarely use Netflix on my phone but this is kind of annoying. I suspect this has something to do with offline movie watching (which is amazing). jj14x You don't need to unlock bootloader to sideload the full OTA images that Google publishes on their website. Tim Harman But you do need it to recover in your phone bootloops, as he said. ilovetesla Dumbest blocking I've ever heard Bruce Wayne I stopped rooting ages ago. Android has gotten so good that I don't need it anymore. Muzzy996 Good for you! Not everyone feels the same though, I know I sure don't. Tasker, Adaway, Greenify, Titanium, Substratum and GMD Gesture Controls are all more important to me than Netflix. The day Netflix stops working on my rooted devices (which are what I watch it on, not my TV) is the day I'll cancel my service. No big loss compared to losing root. Richard Markert Tasker is interesting but never felt the need for it. Adaway, titanium are both irrelevant on my S7, I despise gestures beyond simple swiping in the Cardinal directions, and if stock Android is so perfect why do you need to theme it? C64 I have a s7 edge and the stockrom is full of bloatware from Microsoft, Sansung and Google. More than 20 useless apps are included. So yes the s7 needed root. tim242 Wrong. Package Disabler, no root required. Muzzy996 Never said android is perfect, if it was there wouldn't be any competition in the market or users such as myself who feel the need to customize Android. Root is not something I push onto others, its just something that I want on my devices and I make choices about what services I use or devices I purchase based upon my ability to do it. kostas110 maybe if you use some 500+ euro smartphone from 2016-2017 something that not everyone can do C64 I disagree, Android is one big advertising if you don't use root. Apps have ads (not every app has a pro version), internet browsing sucks without Adaway (build in ad blockers in browsers aren't great), YouTube really sucks if it isn't modded (watch a 30 second ad for a 3 minute movie). And devices are full of bloatware that can't be removed without root. Even the Google stuff are bloatware (kiosk, movies,music,books etc). I also like to remove alot of system apps and replace them with my own apps that i prefer (file manager, agenda, email, music/ video player) and i really hate duplicate apps on my devices. Also Titanium Backup is important to me. So Android​ without root isn't Android for me. jetscreamer01 I use adguard to block stupid ads in my apps. Now using any commercial apps is enjoyable. Cyber_Akuma I hate this response. If anything, I have found far more reasons to root than ever before. Being able to create a backup image and install security/tracking software tat can't just be wiped/uninstalled easily is a big one for example. DJMix I really couldn't understand these kind of stupid moves. I mean I kinda get for an Android Pay or some banking apps to implement these limitations. But seriously, a frickin' streaming app? Afraid they're gonna get pirated? For someone who's going to pirate, they probably could just probably reverse engineer the apk and remove the limitations or basically use older apps. Do they really have some idle engineers that they're forced to implement useless feature? ddevito Guess I'll just pirate it all soon. Their loss. JD Fuck Android If OEMs would fucking provide updates for 5 years I wouldn't need to unlock my bootloader. I'm out. I'll come back when Google fixes this shit. Also fuck Netflix. Back to pirating it is. Christopher Bement My app stopped working on my N7 when I sideloaded 5.0. Got an error when trying to play anything. I went and dropped it back to stock on the latest patch and relocked the bootloader. All working fine now. Too fucking bad, Nougat is fantastic on that device, leaps and bounds better than Marshmallow. tehboogieman Which ROM and which N7 do you have? I still have the stock ROM on my 2013 N7 LTE and have been procrastinating loading an N ROM on it Christopher Bement 2013 LTE version and I was using Nitrogen OS (fantastic and stable ROM). I am now on the latest Marshmallow just so that Netflix will work. tehboogieman As long as I can side load it and sign in I'm still ok. It's a pain, but I'd live with that. But if NF blocks root users from signing in, I'm definitely cancelling and just use one of the very easy pirate apps. Wayne Randall I just signed up for Netflix so I could cancel it. I'm part of the group. tim242 You paid them... Richard Markert Hahahahahaha I don't even use Netflix on my phone (screen is too small) so I don't care. But man, the tears and butthurt from the root community is hilarious. Benjamin Walburn You're a very petty child. Richard Markert When something makes me laugh, I point it out. I do that even have a dog in this hunt. I only watch Netflix on my 75" LED TV. I'm just tired of root users smugness. Almost as smug as apple users. Benjamin Walburn You're tired of people being smug in their hobbies, so you gloat about the problems inflicted on them pointlessly? Petty and a hypocrite. Richard Markert What else am I supposed to do to remove the smugness? My name is…. Get a life maybe? Benjamin Walburn Why should you? Is another person's happiness really that painful for you? You already know that they accomplished nothing more than "successfully followed instructions." It seems like your purpose would be better served by targeting that, not just being a jerk. Humbling them is one thing, being an ass is another entirely. tim242 You sound like the petty child. Stomp your foot, becauseyou don't get your way. Benjamin Walburn Not only am I not doing that, I'm not not getting my way, and "stomping​ my foot" is not an example of pettiness. Your wrongness-density is impressive. My name is…. Who beat you as a child? Richard Markert Lol koiulpoi You're on androidpolice.com... making fun of the root community... and unable to see past the end of your nose... Don't you have anything better to do? lomsha Tard me me A primary reason to root is to run adblock because Google is way too greedy. So the irony, Google's greed means there's less reason to pay for NetFlix. Let me guess... shall we? Google Play Movies still works right...? Oh yes, so long as Google makes their money.... tim242 I block ads with Adguard. No root required. Mike | Homeless On Wheels People still use Netflix? Bit Torrent is your friend. dizel123 Exactly. Everyone should stop using Netflix. Not sure how I'm gonna get the shows i currently watch on Netflix from bit torrent since they won't be made anymore once Netflix is shut down, but at least I'll have my bit torrent friend tim242 Some people like to do things properly. derp_cookies So I agree this is a dumb move but everyone is overreacting by threatening to pirate content. This is a niche problem as less people root now, especially since Android pay won't work when you do it. So Netflix isn't any less accessible than it was before. I watch 99% of Netflix at home on my Roku. Luxferro It's not just rooting. My Nexus 6P is running stock google rom, no root, w/ just unlocked bootloader, and netflix is gone in my play store. Not that I watch TV on my phone... but my shield tv is also unlocked... so it's probably just a matter of time. Roh_Mish Dammit Netflix, you make me want to go popcorn time route. My current primary phone and my iPad are what I use to watch netflix and both of them is stock so i don't have anything to worry about but this just feels wrong. Between this and Amazon not releasing the TV app for my sony TV, which they support outside, popcorn time (and in extension piracy) just seems easier. Vivek Rameses This is why we have piracy. Miguel Angel But ...why? occono Distributors want Netflix to stop any possibility of making DRM-Free backups on the content. Mariano Moreira Even more strange is while Netflix app is removed from Playstore, Netflix VR is still.in Playstore. Manually flashing Factory Image for Google Pixel is how I get me OS updates and I choose to leave bootloader unlocked, rather than relocking every month.(which would include full wipe) So I guess they don't care about security for the few users whom might use Netflix VR with Daydream compatible device? tehboogieman I'm not familiar with the Pixel, but almost every Nexus device lets you lock without wiping all your data. Maybe that requires root though, I really don't understand the details on how it works, but hopefully you can find a way to do it. Mariano Moreira To clarify: In order for me to install Factory Image every month, I need to have Bootloader unlocked. Doing the Factory unlock will wipe the device. Locking the device doesn't wipe the device, but Factory unlocking the bootloader will wipe the device. tehboogieman Yeah, sorry I wasn't more specific. I use an app called BootUnlocker. It lets you lock and unlock the bootloader without wiping at will. Since an app can do this, I'm assuming that it can be done via ADB. Also it might only work on older devices, but maybe there's a way to replicate this action on newer devices as well Mariano Moreira I don't understand why Google is promoting Security by having the device fully-locked, yet still relies on ADB fastboot unlock/OEM Unlock commands to flash factory images? saf1927 Why are using factory images when Google provides OTA images too, and these don't require an unlocked bootloader, nor a wipe? jdrch It's not just Netflix. The HDHomeRun Prime app doesn't work on rooted 7.0+ devices either. Jsilvermist Good to know, will no longer recommend Netflix to anyone when I'm asked... D13H4RD2L1V3 This is stupid. I had to root my phone to be able to hide the navbar at any time I want and also to gain better battery management controls and other stuff that I sorely wished Google had added to stock Android way sooner. And I was considering a Netflix subscription. No longer...... Sruly J I know it's not fully a solution which is "worth it", but the app Custom Navigation Bar offers the ability to hide status bar/narbar without root. Although like you said, you had other reasons to root, so... Diar I pay for Netflix so I can watch the content any way I want guilt free, whether that's their app or other locations on the Internet. F their VPN blocking and DRM. If they make their app impossible to use, I just won't use it. They'll still get my money but they will lose any data/tracking since I'll still be watching their shows, just outside of their ecosystem. Dummies. ReedSolomon Between the SJW nonsense like Bill Nye, the ipv6 tunnel blocking (rather than simply defaulting to ipv4), increases in price, less and less quality content, and now this, I see little reason to keep paying for Netflix. robogo I understand Netflix' reasons, I really do - they need to protect their property and investment. But I can't really say I understand the way they're doing this. This is a good way to alienate the small percentage of power users who root their devices for various, but perfectly valid and understandable reasons. And no, this will not make me cancel my membership as long as the app works. Cancelling membership is a silly, overblown reaction to what is, in my mind, a minor nuisance. D13H4RD2L1V3 I personally just find it a dumb move. Seems like an easy way out. Manbearpig I member when netflix released there app for Android and they did the same thing. I would just download the app and be good to go. After awhile though I stop rooting I miss it sometimes Cyber_Akuma I warned people when Pokemon GO of all things had a surprise update that silently added SafetyNet that this garbage was going to become more and more common. Mario RUN uses it too, and now Netflix.... soon apps everywhere are going to add SafetyNet and block rooted devices as standard practice. Google has been incredibly hostile towards people who actually want to own or have control over their devices or even their PC Software over the last few years. And over the last year google has been making SafetyNet more and more harsh, now even tripping if your BOOTLOADER is unlocked even if your phone is not rooted. Pokemon GO and Mario RUN were a small crowd, but I hope after Netflix of all things starts using it (and make no mistake, this is just the beginning) that people will finally push back against Google's hostility towards rooted users. BillPosters I rooted my Android phone to get rid of the annoying camera shutter sound, and to prevent apps from stealing my contacts, and to basically take control of my device rather than letting Google run the whole show, and because of that I can't update Netflix? Good riddance Netflix. Railwayman There is a better solution: Declare the device a DRM free zone and use everything else. DRM to me is "Don't Restrict Me!" and an excellent reason to give certain companies the middle finger telling them to just go and F themselves. The most ironic thing here is that removing Netflix or using DRM otherwise doesn't stop piracy. On the contrary - By buying and using DRM content you get to travel in the cargo hold with no heating while the pirating consumer get first class service: more content, no restrictions, no copyright trailers or ads before the movie start and stop on. Even better: They can use whatever apps or ROMs they want. Would I unroot my device in order to get DRM content onboard? No way!!! If Netflix are so scared - block the client on Mac OS X and Windows et al. Piracy doesn't usually happen with an Android device as a source but rather computers and HDCP rippers. Another thing also to the DRM companies: Everything that can be played back can be recorded! (Good old piracy saying) Netflix out, Fusion with Exodus, SALTS and Phoenix in. Kodi with Rapier skin is much nicer than the Netflix client and Trakt integration make this way a much better one than going down the DRM route, sitting with an uprooted stock ROM and Netflix.;) saf1927 Magisk seems to do the trick. Helios What about my non-rooted OnePlus One? It's also listed as incompatible.. '-_- 天地人 Don't OnePlus devices run a custom ROM and have unlocked bootloaders? Android Developer How can they block people who root the device from installing the app? The play store doesn't have this filter. Maybe after the install they do this check?

As part of the initiative, all the 102 state ambulances in the city have been synced with the app. The 108 BVG MEMS app provides users the option to either call or message for an ambulance service The app, 108 BVG MEMS, is currently available on Google Store and provides users the option of either calling or messaging for an ambulance. If the caller dials the helpline number, the attendee would directly spot the location of the caller through Google maps, and thus, help save precious time. In case the caller is unable to get through 108, he/she can message the reason the ambulance is required. Currently, the options vary from eye problems, falls, heart problems and environment exposure. Interestingly, if the call drops, the app has a facility to automatically track the caller from the registered number. When this mid-day reporter tried the app, a helper from 108 immediately called back. "The application has been launched in collaboration with government hospitals. It has made communication with emergency services easier. Often, during accidents, callers aren't able to provide the exact location. In such a situation, this app will be of great help. It will also help tackle any delays in treatment," said Dr Satish Pawar, state health director. Need to monitor ambulances Medical experts have demanded the regulation of the growing number of ambulances in the city. Currently, in Mumbai, there are a total of 1,740 private and public ambulances registered with the RTO. Dr Rita Savla, founder-director, RADHEE Disaster and Education Foundation said that the need of the hour is to introduce the Emergency Medical Service Act (EMSA) to monitor and classify ambulances. "We are in talks with the government to bifurcate the ambulance services. Often, ambulances equipped to handle serious cases are used for minor accidents. There is a need to classify ambulances to focus on timely reatment," said Dr Savla.

BlackBerry KEYone review: A tale of a decent phone full of annoyances Jordan Palmer Follow View All Posts 2017/05/04 6:00am PDTMay 4, 2017 9 Plus 1 on G+ 20 Share on Facebook 48 Share on Twitter Total Shares77 Blackberry KEYone News Phone Reviews Reviews Article Contents 1 Specs 2 The Good 3 The Not So Good 4 Design & build quality 5 Display 6 Battery life 7 Audio 8 Call quality & connectivity 9 Camera 10 Software 10.1 BlackBerry apps 10.2 Settings & general UI 10.3 Performance 11 Value 12 Conclusion The KEYone, the latest in the BlackBerry Ltd/TCL collaboration, is a phone that returns to the Canadian brand's iconic roots, for better or for worse. With Nougat and a strong focus on security, the KEYone is aimed at enterprise users and long-time fanatics. Overall, the spec sheet for this phone is nothing chart-topping. The SoC is over a year old at this point and the screen has been downgraded from the year-and-a-half-old Priv's, but using the KEYone was mostly a pleasant experience until after about a week with it. That was when I started experiencing rather noticeable slowdown and other problems. So what does a proverbial return to form for BlackBerry mean in the ever massive Android space? Well, there's not really a simple answer. But let's get going — we've got a lot to cover. You don't want to be here all day, do you? The unit that I've been using for the last week and some change is pre-production. There have been a few hiccups with the software along the way, which I'll note in the appropriate section below. Most of these problems will hopefully be fixed before the KEYone is available for sale. Specs Display 4.5" IPS LCD 1620 x 1080; 434 ppi CPU Snapdragon 625 GPU Adreno 506 Software Android 7.1.1 Nougat; BlackBerry Security RAM 3GB Storage 32GB, expandable via microSD Cameras 12MP IMX378 (1.55μm) rear, 8MP front Battery 3,505mAh; Quick Charge 3.0 Misc USB Type-C 3.1, fingerprint sensor, 3.5mm jack, physical keyboard, NFC Connectivity 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac, dual-band; Bluetooth 4.2; LTE bands 1/2/3/4/5/7/12/13/20/25/26/28/29/30 Measurements 149.3 x 72.5 x 9.4 mm; 180 g Buy BlackBerry The Good Software The "stock" take on Android with BlackBerry's apps is great. It feels like what Motorola does: functionality added on top of Google's vision. It has the latest security patch and Android 7.1.1. Battery life My time with phones from the likes of Huawei and Xiaomi has somewhat desensitized me to stellar battery life, but the KEYone is definitely above average. Screen The color accuracy, brightness, and viewing angles are spectacular. The screen crisp and more than adequate, despite its odd size and aspect ratio. Fingerprint sensor I am not sure from where the fingerprint sensor was sourced, but it's almost on Huawei's level for speed and accuracy. Seriously, my success rate has been almost perfect. Build quality The KEYone is one hell of a solid device. The aluminium frame combined with the soft-touch back make the phone feel extremely durable. The Not So Good Ergonomics/weight The KEYone is chunky and is a bit difficult to hold. Typing with one hand on the physical keyboard is also a pain. And even though it's only 180 grams, the KEYone feels very dense and heavy. Using it single-handed is not a pleasant experience for long periods. Speaker I know this should go without saying, but the speaker quality on this phone is pretty terrible. Performance Major lag, homescreen redraws, and RAM management issues led to a phone that, after about a week of use, became almost unusable. Design & build quality To give you some perspective on the KEYone and its design, the marketing materials say that the phone is "Distinctly different. Distinctly BlackBerry." That last part, and to an extent the first, is quite true. BlackBerry (well, it's really TCL, but you know what I mean) has opted for what you might call the quintessential look that defined the heyday of Research In Motion. And while that seems like a negative at first glance, the KEYone's design exhibits some modernization in its overall execution. This phone garnered more looks, comments, and questions in my time with it than any other I've used — I'd say that it comes close to the amount of attention I received when smartwatches were still young. The physical keyboard is what drew people's eyes. The whole front face would throw anyone for a loop, especially when we're starting to see such high screen-to-body ratios these days. Not a single person that I've come across thinks that this is a pretty device... and I agree with them. The KEYone is not beautiful, elegant, slim, or anything else like that; it is aimed at a niche that, in theory, cares little for those things in a pocket computer. From the back, the phone looks fairly unassuming and normal. The soft-touch finish feels like it was ripped off of the good ol' OG Nexus 7. My fingertips glide across the band-aid texture, but when push comes to shove, my hand grips it solidly. Coupled with an aluminium frame, the KEYone feels sturdy, durable... and like a brick. To put this kindly, it is one hell of a chunky phone — I actually had 2010-2011 phone era flashbacks when I removed it from the box. At 180 grams (6.35 ounces for you Imperial folks), the KEYone gets quite heavy in the hand after prolonged usage. See, I have this odd tendency to support phones with my little finger while I'm using them; BlackBerry has made me decide to try to break that habit. I know that I mentioned it briefly, but let's talk seriously about the KEYone's keyboard. When smartphones were starting to trend toward on-screen keyboards, I was not happy. I liked the tactile response of my Droid and Droid 2, and haptic feedback was just not as satisfying. I had also not learned to type without looking on my G1 or HTC Hero, a problem I did not have with any of my Droids or BlackBerries. I eventually got over myself and became a solid fan of SwiftKey and the navbar that Google brought to Android with Ice Cream Sandwich. Now that I'm all done reminiscing, let's get back to the topic at hand. The KEYone's backlit keyboard is really good, if not a little weird after spending the last several years with a software variant. If I were a keyboard nerd like Ryan, I'd describe the travel distance, tactile feel, and the like — I just like my gaming mice and PC hardware. While the keys are much too small for my taste, I found that I actually had very few errors in general usage. Each one is easily pressed and responds with a solid click. The layout is obviously QWERTY (duh), so it's pretty easy to get to the point where you're typing fairly quickly. So far, the only things that have taken me some time to adjust to are the symbol layout and the placement of the left shift key versus ALT. Most of my errors have been activating the alternative mode instead of capitalizing the next letter. If you're into it, there are 52 programmable keyboard shortcuts that can open apps or contacts. For instance, you could assign a long press of 'c' to open Chrome, 'f' to start up Facebook, and so on. There's one catch, though: it's limited to the BlackBerry Launcher. In any other, long-pressing a letter will bring up a phone search for shortcuts and apps that are associated with that key. One of the other interesting features is the flick gesture, which inserts the first SwiftKey-like prediction when you, well, flick your thumb up the board. My biggest gripe about the keyboard is the fact that I have to see it every time that I am using the phone. Whereas the Priv has the sliding mechanism to mask its keyboard when you aren't using it, the KEYone's stares you in the face. This reduces the screen size to 4.5" and a 3:2 aspect ratio. I understand that this design choice was made in the spirit of the BlackBerries of old, but I can't say that I am a fan. And if you don't like the physical keyboard or just don't want to use it all of the time, you can use the software version. However, unlike the Priv, this is not the best option. A full-screen keyboard on this smaller display is not the most pleasant of experiences. The fingerprint sensor is fantastic. Embedded in the space bar, it's lightning quick and very accurate. Only Huawei's sensors have proven so reliable for me, which should tell you something. The front of the phone has the screen, the capacitive navigation buttons, the keyboard, and the front camera (and earpiece/sensors) along the upper aluminium bezel. The back has the rather large camera module (there's still a hump, by the way, despite this thing being a brick) and BlackBerry logo. On the top of the frame, you will find the 3.5mm headphone jack. The left side only has the power button, while the bottom houses the speaker grilles and the USB Type-C 3.1 port. Finally, the right side is home to the SIM tray, volume rocker (which feels cheap and hollow) and what BlackBerry calls the "Convenience Key." Both it and the power button feel only slightly more solid than the volume rocker and I'd honestly rather see one of them be textured or differentiated in some way from the other. Just because they're on opposite sides of the phone does not mean I didn't mix them up from time to time. The Convenience Key is a tertiary button that is customizable and can be mapped to almost any action you want. It can open a certain app, activate one of many shortcuts, or perform a few system functions like power off. At this moment, I have it mapped to Google Now since Assistant is tied to a long press of the home button. Let's just say that I've opened Now a lot more than I usually do. It's cool to see BlackBerry trying to cater in some form to power users by adding in this key. At least this isn't chained to a useless virtual assistant. Overall, the KEYone is well-built, but it is a polarizing device in its design and construction. Some people will love it, while I think that most won't. It doesn't have the sneaky, incognito aspect that the Priv did, which is not necessarily a bad thing. Whether you like the look of the phone or not is entirely up to you — I'm just not the biggest fan of it. Display When discussing the KEYone's display, most will inevitably focus on the aspect ratio, i.e. its general shape. BlackBerry went with something decidedly more square than what most of us are used to. Despite this, the 1620x1080 IPS panel is crisp, clear, and quite bright. I am rather fond of the color reproduction, and I found this to be one of the more accurate panels that I've used. There's even an sRGB mode. The viewing angles are superb and the screen is just a joy to look at. It also gets very bright for outdoor use. The display is not the KEYone's strongest aspect, but nor is it the weakest. The resolution is more than adequate especially given the total screen size. There really isn't that much more to say on the matter: great screen, awesome colors, but it won't blow you away. Battery life With a 3,505mAh battery, you'd expect the KEYone to last a long time. I mean, that's one of the features that BlackBerry is hoping encourages people to buy this phone. The good news is that it is certainly above average. After using Huawei and Xiaomi devices for the last few months, I have gotten used to a phone that can easily get me through a day, so I am glad that this one continues the trend. During my testing, I had the screen at 100% brightness with plenty of texting, emailing, messaging, and several attempts to watch YouTube videos and play games. Not only did I get over five hours of screen-on-time, but the idle drain on the battery was practically negligible. The largest battery to ever come in a BlackBerry phone and the screen resolution help to contribute to the claim that you can get 26 hours of "mixed use," but if you run low, Qualcomm's Quick Charge 3.0 is supported. When you plug the phone in, you are presented with two options: Charge Only and Boost Mode. The latter is touted as "giving you the most efficient charge possible, even if you only have a few minutes." Good on BlackBerry for making another phone with good battery life. It's pretty damn stellar. Audio When I think of a BlackBerry, I don't always picture a phone with the best sound quality and output. Sure, it might get the job done, but you know what I mean. In all fairness, the KEYone is not meant to be your media player — rather, it's not supposed to be the one on your desk that pleases your ears the most. It gets the job done, that's about all I can say. The sound that pushes out of the headphone jack is tolerable and works just fine for the gym or other activities where you won't be lugging around high fidelity cans. The external speaker is subpar, even considering that this is a smartphone. For music or notifications, there is plenty of distortion and crackling at 80%+ volume. The cacophony at that level is awful, so I've left the KEYone in vibrate-only most of the time. At least the phone has a good vibration motor. Call quality & connectivity When I first received the KEYone and inserted my SIM card, I was sorely unimpressed. Mobile data would not work due to a problem with the APN settings and the phone presented me with an annoying notification telling me that there was a problem. After some digging and chatting with "people in the know," I found out that this was a known issue with this pre-production build of the software and it was being addressed in preparation for the final release. After manually setting up the APN for my MVNO carrier, my wireless connectivity has been passable. Call quality reached my expectations — Bluetooth and WiFi have also been reliable. I have had my LG Watch Urbane (Android Wear 2.0), Moto 360, and Samsung Gear S3 connected to it during my entire usage. None have had any issues staying connected, nor did I have trouble with any of the Bluetooth headsets I tried. Reception, however, was another matter entirely. The phone constantly dropped calls or failed to make them at all. I also frequently lost data connection or experienced slower speeds than what I am used to on my carrier. The KEYone also experienced cell signal holes that have never been there — I went through a hole near my house every day, but all of my other devices were just fine in the same area (same SIM, etc). It was extremely frustrating. Camera I'll admit: I went into all of this not expecting much from the camera. Come on, it's a BlackBerry. But seriously, the KEYone's is legitimately good. It performs well in low-light environments with post-processing that is kind to photos. I'm certainly glad to see BlackBerry carry on where the Priv's camera left off. With all of that being said, it cannot quite hold its own next to the Pixel, GS8/GS7, or even the P10. The KEYone can put out good-quality pictures that are crisp in detail, but with some aggressive smoothing in post-processing. Those of you who pay attention will notice that the KEYone packs the same sensor as the Pixel, the IMX378. While that certainly can lend itself to good photos, it's not the be-all, end-all. My opinion is that this is one of those phones where it's more difficult to take a bad picture. This camera is like a jack-of-all-trades — you'll get great outdoor, indoor, and nighttime photos. Will they have that so-called "Wow!" factor? Well, that depends on you. Moving around to the front, BlackBerry opted for an 8MP fixed focus, 84° wide angle shooter. LCD flash is also included. Supposedly, this is best suited for those video conferences where you're not in a position to get somewhere with better lighting. This is the official blurb on the matter: "For times when you have to take a video conference on the go, the device includes an 8MP front camera with fixed focus, LCD flash, and 84-degree wide angle lens." Just own up to the fact that you put in an LCD flash for selfies; there's nothing wrong with that. Wrapping all of this up, let's go over the camera UI. It's basic, but in a good way. In Auto, you are presented with the upper bar that has the settings for flash, timer, aspect ratio, and HDR, as well as the general options. Along the bottom is the gallery preview, front/rear camera switcher, shutter button, mode selection, and visual effects. In the options, you have the control mode, where you choose between auto and manual. Then there's the JPEG fine or standard compression choices, face detection, and video resolution stuff. The KEYone can go all the way up to 4K30fps, but you lose "enhanced video stabilization" above 1080p30, which is kind of a bummer. Contrast this camera app UI with something from Huawei and you'll see why I am a huge fan. There aren't as many options, but what's there is useful and mostly necessary. Good job, BlackBerry. Previous Next Software When the Priv launched a year and a half ago, the general consensus seemed to be that the software was good. Much like Motorola and OnePlus, BlackBerry has gone with a "stock+" take on Android, i.e. where Google's vision is kept intact, but useful features are added on top to better the user experience. The KEYone follows the same logic, though with Nougat 7.1.1 running underneath this time around. The BlackBerry brand is built on security, reliability, and stability. When the company shifted over to Android from the corpse that was BB OS, it brought with it some of the hallmarks upon which it had built its reputation. There was a commitment to updating to the latest monthly security patches, the DTEK security suite, and even some hardware modifications that all helped to ensure users had the safest and most secure take on Android. Now we're here with the KEYone and that focus is still on-point. On the surface, the software looks like stock Android, but there's a bunch running under the hood, from the apps to the settings and options. I'll go through both of those elements in their own sub-sections to follow. I think you'll be as surprised as I was in regard to the level of depth and detail with each addition made. Not all of it is useful, in my opinion, but it's there. BlackBerry apps This is one of the pillars for BlackBerry's plan to draw potential customers. My time with BlackBerry's phones was so long ago that I hardly remember what BB OS was like (and I never even used v10). Even if I did, I can tell you right now that I was not a hardcore user, so the KEYone gave me my first experience with a lot of the apps that BlackBerry loyalists swear by. The Hub app is where it's at, at least in terms of sheer power user capability. This functions as a place where you can see all of your messages, emails, texts, and other related notifications. It pulls from Gmail, your default SMS app, IM services, and various social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest, and LinkedIn. Due to the volume of incoming emails and the email-fu that I am forced to do each day, I ignore Gmail in Hub. It was just too difficult since it still doesn't support the tabbed inbox or filters/labels as well as I'd like. You can also set up custom views for Hub, where you select what accounts will show up — this is how I was able to successfully "ignore" Gmail. For enterprise users, this could be the way you separate your work and personal data. While this is all great, I frankly got bored when trying to make Hub work to my advantage. It can take a lot of work, time, and effort to get it the way you want it. I have no doubt that some people will do this, because there is much power to be had in the app, but it is not for everyone.   Nipping at the heels of Hub in terms of marketing importance, we have DTEK. Though it's still being hyped just like it was when the Priv launched, it remains a mostly useless, feel-good example of the placebo effect. You're presented with red Xs, yellow exclamation points, and green check-marks that denote your level of security in various areas. It's a centralized location to show the average user the basics of Android security, which isn't a bad thing. I suppose I am shrugging it off because I know what I'm doing when it comes to this stuff and my perfectionist/completionist nature hates not seeing green check marks. Since I am not going to change my usage habits, then I might as well not look at annoying yellow exclamation points. For those of you who are wondering what my DTEK status is, I am sitting firmly at "Fair." As annoying as that is, at least I am using a BlackBerry device (because that's one of the security checks). I can sleep a bit better tonight knowing that. If you hit green on all criteria, then your needle will be in the "Excellent" range on the gauge. Good for you.   DTEK is actually worth a damn when it comes to showing what apps are accessing certain permissions and notifying you when they do. Or you can have it inform you when a specific application is requesting certain permissions. For example, I can tell DTEK to let me know when something accesses my calendar or to notify me when Action Launcher alone tries to read it. There are certain people who will love this — I am not one of them. BBM is here, for some reason. It's still the same old app and I really don't feel like going over it. Basically, if you use BBM then you know what it is. If you don't, you're not missing much. There's still no SMS functionality; Android Messages is your default out of the box. The Calendar app is cool, I guess. It still has the "Meeting Mode," which automatically silences your phone when you're in a meeting according to your calendar. There are also options for creating events in different time zones from the system one and whether or not the app informs you if events conflict. It's a neat take, but I wouldn't call it special. Finally, there are various note-taking, task, password management, and photo markup apps. None are particularly worth paying attention to and I am sure there are better offerings from either Google or other third-party developers. I don't want to waste too much time with them. Settings & general UI Apps are great and all, but what about overall user interface? Like I said, the software is "stock+" Android. It looks, feels, and functions much like Nougat would on a Nexus or Pixel, but there are additional options to play with. Most of them lie in the display settings menu, so I'll address some of them. There's the color balance slider (for cool or warm, or somewhere in between) How you want the Recents menu to look — you have the choice of Rolodex, which is the normal way, Tiles, and Masonry A green bar along the edge of the screen that shows the battery level remaining while charging (it's neat and I've seen it before in custom ROMs) An option to double tap to wake/sleep the phone. There's one final piece that I want to address in more detail. It's called the Productivity Tab and it exists as a small white bar on the far right edge of the screen (its position and thickness can be adjusted). If you've used Action Launcher and the Quickpage feature, then that's basically how this works. If you have no idea what I'm talking about, the Productivity Tab pulls out from the side of the screen and has five sections. The first is a calendar widget showing you what you have going on that day or the next. After that is a Hub shortcut to show you any unread messages. Sections 3 and 4 are a todo and contacts list, respectively. Finally, there's a settings sub-menu for the Tab, where you adjust position, transparency, height, thickness, etc. I like the Productivity Tab for little more than the calendar widget, which is exactly what I use the Quickpage for in my default Action Launcher setup.    The other addition you'll see in the system settings is for the Convenience Key, which I mentioned all the way back up closer to the top of this review. It's the thing under the volume rocker that looks/feels exactly like the power button. Oh, yeah, you can map it to open whatever app or shortcut you want. I find it mostly useless. but some may find it to their liking. The sub-menu itself is pretty straightforward: it shows you what the key does, what action is currently assigned to it, the option to clear said action, and a short list of what you can map to it. Here's what's available to choose: "Open app" will bring up a list of everything you have installed "Speed dial" allows you to set a contact to the key (don't do this) "Send message" allows you to open either an email or a text to send to a specific contact "All shortcuts" brings up a long list of all the shortcuts that BlackBerry thinks you could ever use/need. Once you make your choice, that's what the Convenience Key will do until you select something else. It only works when the screen is on and unlocked, so keep that in mind. There's a gestures section, but it only has the toggle for the double-tap power button for camera shortcut. Not sure why this is off on its own, but whatever. The sound settings still has the "Notify during calls" and "Flip to mute" options — I disabled the former because who needs that. The security area is actually almost stock, except for the picture password. By the way, skip that, too. Developer options has the sRGB mode toggle I mentioned earlier (which always turns itself off when I back out of the menu), but it's missing the OEM unlock entry. Because this is BlackBerry, so no unlocking or rooting for you. Everything else is all the same as a Nexus or Pixel. BlackBerry Launcher, the default out of the box, is pretty basic. You have the option for those keyboard shortcuts and little else of note. After I toyed around with it for a bit, I moved on to Action Launcher. The notification shade and Quick Settings are also just like stock with the same animations and everything.   If you're super paranoid about people peering over your shoulder to look at the stuff on your screen, BlackBerry provides you with the Privacy Shade (via the Play Store). This prevents others from physically seeing private and sensitive content by blocking out everything except for a tiny viewing area. How big this little window is depends on what size you want, but even with Privacy Shade active, you can still interact with your screen. It's neat, I suppose. You can adjust the shape and background transparency via the little menu that appears when the Shade is active. Performance The Snapdragon 625 powering all of this is not too bad of a chip. Though decidedly midrange and a year old at this point, it carried the KEYone along better than I would have thought initially. However, after about a week, the lags, stutters, and hiccups started to settle in, with the most noticeable being exiting the camera app, constant homescreen redraws, and apps not remaining in memory very well. The camera thing was especially bad when I used the power button shortcut to launch the camera from a locked state; exiting after this caused the phone to hang for almost thirty seconds. Following that, there'd be another forty-five seconds of unresponsiveness, even from the fingerprint sensor or power button. Suffice to say, it was quite annoying and dismaying. I am not sure whether this is a bug in the pre-production software or not; regardless, it was irritating and made using that shortcut more than useless. As time went on, the sheer sluggishness of the phone became quite apparent. Animations would lag, the whole OS would hang when launching apps at random intervals, and my homescreen redrew every time I went back home (I used BlackBerry, Action, and Nova Launcher — all with the same result). I also experienced some seriously aggressive RAM management/problems. As an example, I opened a new app for the first time and needed to sign in. I knew my password, but needed my 2FA code. Switching over to Authy, I grabbed the code and double-tapped the recents button to switch back to the original app... only to find that it needed to reload, requiring my credentials again. After all of that, the 2FA code had expired. Rinse and repeat; I just used Authy on my PC to get signed in after a near instance of rage quitting. That's just a singular example, but things like that happened often. Geekbench 4 was having troubles The Adreno 506 GPU is pretty capable, though. The only problem is that there is no reason to game on this phone — not only is the screen quite small for such an activity, but the keyboard and overall design of the phone's face make gaming uncomfortable. The GPU is just wasted potential, I'd say. These issues could be related to this pre-production hardware and software, but there was a point at which the KEYone became unusable. These problems persisted through reboots. Performance for the first several days was quite good, but it deteriorated very rapidly. Surprisingly so, actually, which made the disappointment I felt seem worse. I should note that I will be retesting everything with a production model when the phone is released to see if these issues persist. Value As we near the end of this journey review, I'm left with a few questions. The one I will ask and hopefully answer in this penultimate section is this: Is the KEYone worth it? Besides the horribly stylized name and physical keyboard, what is the value proposition of this phone? It will retail for $549 USD, which puts it at the high end of the midrange spectrum. That's still a hefty sum for a year-old SoC and some very fast performance degradation, even though both of those come with a decent screen, good camera, and awesome overall software experience. Even with all of the security stuff and the keyboard, I am not entirely convinced that $549 is a good price. $349 is probably the most that I would pay for this phone, especially when you consider that a Pixel is $100 more than the asking price ($650) or that a OnePlus 3T starts at $440. Both phones come with better internals, a similar overall UI/UX, and better cameras. What makes the MSRP even more painful is the subpar performance (note: again, this could be related to the pre-production hardware/software), something that I cannot in good conscience ignore or fail to mention in this regard. You will be much happier with what OnePlus, Google, and even Samsung have to offer you. BlackBerry is likely going to aim this at the enterprise, which may not care about the price tag as much as us normal consumers. Those users, however, do want a phone that's going to work well no matter what they're doing. The long and short of it is that if you're considering this phone as one of your options, then I'd say go with the OnePlus 3T as the best value for your money; if your budget is a little more flexible, then go with a Pixel or Galaxy S8. If you're really interested in one of these, just wait until they go on sale. Conclusion So who is the KEYone for, exactly? According to BlackBerry, it's meant for: "people who use their phones more for communication rather than media consumption, people who are tired of having the same one as everyone else, people who are professionals and rely on their phone to get things done, and people who are looking for something durable that will last through a busy day." If you want my opinion (and you did just read this whole thing, so why wouldn't you), I would say that the KEYone is for the BlackBerry power user of yore. I never was one, but I do know a few who still talk about their old phones. This phone is for them. Minus the DTEK50 and DTEK60, the KEYone is BlackBerry's (and TCL's) latest real attempt at the Android side of things since the Priv. From my time with it, the KEYone failed at providing a good user experience, even though it is a little eccentric and anachronistic in a cute way. BlackBerry returned to its roots with this phone, its aim fixed squarely on the fans of old. Personally, I happen to prefer the glass slabs that we have nowadays and I think that the KEYone is a relic of a long bygone age. I eventually adjusted to the form factor and physical keyboard, but even after reaching that point, I still did not enjoy typing (versus my current neutral feeling on the matter with the software versions). Simply put, I do not like the KEYone. I do, however, appreciate a solid, well-built device even if it is a brick. But good construction is only a single criterion when evaluating a device for recommendation and I don't think that the average consumer or even an Android nerd would enjoy using this phone. It's kind of ugly, bulky, dense, and one of the main draws, the keyboard, is a novelty at best. This is definitely a niche product and I usually frown on that because it's so limiting — honestly, that's probably just the business student in me talking. BlackBerry/TCL clearly have a target market for the KEYone that they believe is slavering for it (I am certainly not in it). That being said, narrowing down to a specific demographic does not excuse a poor user experience. I've said it plenty of times in this review, but I'll say it again: I know that the model I have is pre-production hardware and software. Bugs, janks, and other oddities are to be expected. There was supposed to be an update for the review units, but I have not received it as of this writing. I like what the KEYone is trying to be and do. It's a quirky little thing that was actually fun to use sometimes just because it's so different. The "stock+" Android is also quite refreshing and helped to subdue some of my frustrations early on. But being unique with great software cannot carry a phone through the trials that this phone presented. And no, the irony of this is not lost on me — I usually get the phones with outstanding hardware and bogus software. The Snapdragon 625 is a decent chip in its own right; on paper, I should have never had the problems I did. Odds are, either you have already decided that you want one of these or your company's IT department will purchase them in bulk. In both of those cases, I wish you the best and hope that you have the best experience that this phone has to offer. Perhaps the issues I've had will be fixed with production hardware or a few software updates down the line, or maybe it's all been down to bad luck in the silicon lottery (#jordansluck). But I just have a feeling that the KEYone will go down as one of those Android phones that has a cult following, but is ultimately worth more in a few years as an antique than as a daily driver today.

It probably has its niche, but I agree that the era of the keyboard phone has passed, and for good reason. I'll take my big screen and easy one-handed typing, and honestly, I sincerely doubt I would ever be faster on a hardware keyboard. We're all so used to software boards and such autocomplete wizards that I bet 90% of people out there would never get close to matching their speed with a touchscreen on one of these chiclet boards. I also don't really think the camera seems like anything all that special, at least based on the samples here. Nick Becker Honestly, the physical keyboard was the only reason I was considering getting one of these. What I really want, though, is a new version of the HTC G2/Desire Z. YaKillaCJ I still have 1 in a drawer somewhere. That device was awesome and innovative. Hmm, maybe if HTC should look into the keyboard. Nick Becker I still have mine, too. It's just too old now for modern apps. Good_Ole_Pinocchio Phone with a 625... If you're not getting the Z Play, you're doing it wrong.... And well I completely agree with you on hardware keyboards being ridiculous in 2017 robogo Lenovo P2. Same specs, 5100 mAh battery. steadymobb Will the p2 ever get 7.0 though? Prob not... tonkerdog1 . No keyboard. Made of plastic and no Blackberry software. Completely different phone. robogo Was referring to the similarities with the Z Play. Sohit Especially considering the LG G6 is on sale for $500 Francois Nguyen I actually HATE most touchscreen keyboards, even if if's for typing small messages. I even hated landscape mechanical keyboards because I always break the sliding mechanism over time -_-. Being used to portrait mechanical keyboards (and old PC keyboards from the 90s) for so long, the only cellphones that lasted for me were a BB Q10 for 2 years (and a Palm Treo 680 for 5 years before that). I abused the heck out of Android Runtime for gathering my most needed apps. I tried iOS for 1 year and never got used to the keyboard. I tried several Android phones that didn't last 3 months for me. I'm glad now that the KEYone will show up in June 2017, even if it's WAY too late for me and I'm ironically not interested in buying it lol. Jack ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ mostly nostalgia. Honestly I will buy it if the price drops to $400 level YaKillaCJ My bet is the lags are due to stock 7.1.1. The 625 is very capable of everyday task proven by other OEMs. Something Xiaomi's Miui has a huge advantage over nearly everyone, optimization while including plethora of features. Proven by the Redmi Note 3 Pro (SD650) and Redmi Note 4x (SD625). Plus this price is just too much and I said it when it was announced. Yet so many nay sayers were upset at my comment siting its niche product. While a Niche allows it to be sold for more than Xiaomi and Huawei offerings, it doesn't justify pricing past Flagship specs. This cost more than OnePlus 3/T, ZTE Axon 7 & Xiaomi Mi5 that offer Flagship specs/hardware, thriving OEMs and update history. Not to mention Miui and OxygenOS. Blackberry should drop the price and use Android 7.0 instead until Google themselves stabilize Android 7.1.x. Miku is Best Vocaloid I don't think it's an issue with the Android version. My Moto Z Play has been running LineageOS ever since it became official and I haven't encountered any lag issues, even after a few weeks. If an unofficial version of 7.1 can run perfectly on the 625, there's no reason OEM 7.1 can't run properly on it. YaKillaCJ My key words were stock. As in they never optimized the Android software. Great examples is how Miui and OxygenOS takes whatever version and clearly tweak and optimize it. So I'm not surprised LOS runs great, it includes a modified/optimized kernel, drivers, blobs, default apps, etc tailored for your device. Throwing straight up stock versions of Android that basically just runs without optimization nor bug fixes is something TCL is known for. Look at Blu for example. HabsSuck what a hate on commentary, come to expect it from some HumbleButBlunt Although I agree with your comment I find it hilarious coming from someone who's screen name is "HabsSuck". DEVVVV Too bad BlackBerry continues to do what got them in trouble in the first place. this is due to total lack of innovation. Blackberry was a one hit wonder and if they don't get someone in there that possesses innovation they are done. HumbleButBlunt They are already done making devices... tonkerdog1 . Who makes the IPhone? Apple.......nope Nate650 Total lack of innovation!? This phone showcases innovation in many ways, such as the capacitive keyboard which they have a patent on. The same can't be said about the popular iPhone. All Apple has basically done in the last five generations is change the screen size. Michael Tran Does it have always listening "ok google" That would be a dealbreaker for me if it doesn't have it. Pat Richardson Your reasoning about the keyboard does not work for me. "Easy one hand typing" isn't even a thing anymore now that phones are 5.5" to 6" and touch/swype (word prediction selected "tofu") is a pain because of poor predictions. Since there is only one small flag ship phone (Sony xperis compact) one hand typing shouldn't even be an argument against a physical keyboard, which is more accurate, quick, and does not require looking at the keys. Every other word on swipe I swear I have to rewrite because of horrible predictions. And touch doing is no better since you cannot feel the keys I agree with everything else toy said about the phone though. Marcelove Start using Swiftkey and stop complaining...😉 Pat Richardson That's funny because that's what I'm using ToniCipriani ✓pǝᴉɟᴉɹǝʌ I used it. It's sh1t. As with every other bajillion VKB out there. I don't need keyboards that try to learn and output what it thinks I'm typing. I need a keyboard to output what I type, nothing more. Capacitive screens are inherently inaccurate. Imparus The size isn't really an argument when it comes to keyboard, pretty much every keyboard support "one hand" mode, where you can make it smaller, so even if it is big you can still reach all the letters with one hand. Pat Richardson While I can concede to this, phones are no longer small enough for one-hand general use. Trying to tap that top right button with your left hand puts you at risk of dropping your phone, so you mostly operate your phone with two hands anyway. To make a keyboard smaller for one hand typing is counter-intuitive for a screen size that's more operable with two hands. Maybe during situational uses the one handed mode is fine. Anyway, despite this argument the physical keyboard I find is much more accurate and comfortable than touch typing. Winston They know there's a very dedicated niche dedicated to this class of smartphone, and seeing how they're the only player in a field with very dedicated fans, I don't blame them for charging the significant margin. Chris Oh "LCD" flash??? David Ruddock The screen flashes white. DEVVVV the screen flashes white?? So that must mean only for selfies. what if I am doing a recording? and want to see how it is recording in real time?? ecnjnr Tbmobn fby Uo B Mayoo Did it hurt when you fell on your keyboard? Kieron Quinn Maybe they just put their KEYone in their pocket ecnjnr 6P ;) ecnjnr My virtual keyboard posted this from my pocket, lol. Can't wait for a physical keyboard phone. Mayoo http://whatyearisit.info/img/what_year_is_it.jpg ecnjnr 2017 :) Miku is Best Vocaloid There's something called "locking" you may have heard of it :^) Cinj Still don't understand why BB dumped their own OS in favor of Android, especially since BB10 was capable of running Android apps. That's like buying a Mac just to format the drive and put Windows on it, what's the point? I bought my mom a Blackberry Classic and it's a great little phone especially for more tech challenged people who don't need or want all the bells and whistles that come with the two major players. If BB is going to shift to just making mediocre Android phones, they may as well close up shop already. Francois Nguyen Some reasons I guess (based on my own experience with BBOS 10): - Software AND hardware issues on double-tapping on the hardware keyboard - lack of apps - lack of support from major players (facebook, BB itself) Cinj My response to each point: - No opinion since I haven't encountered this - 99% of apps are garbage so no big deal - You can't as easily help clog the internet with pics of the unimpressive food you just ate, unfunny memes, and "like, share, and type amen or you're going to hell" spam? How will humanity survive??? - Quite the opposite. BB is way less obtuse in it's interface than the constantly changing Android one. Android and it's apps are like a hieroglyphic tile puzzle that keeps getting shuffled with every update. Try teaching a tech illiterate parent how to operate Android, I dare you. - Neither of those really have a distinct advantage over the other. But it's nice to have options all the same. - See previous opinion on apps Not trying to slam you or anything, just giving my take. I think we need more options in the marketplace, not less. That's really my main gripe. But I know that's a fantasy because people generally gravitate towards a duality, so for now we're stuck with iOS and Android until some paradigm shift occurs. Francois Nguyen My responses to your responses lol: - it's not a widespread issue; it's not surprising a lot of people didn't know about it - that 1 % of good and varied apps is what everyone I know (tech illiterate or not) makes the switch to iOS or Android so I wouldn't ignore that - I agree with you on your statement. Most consumers disagree on this, though... My friends ABSOLUTELY need to tell the world what they eat for supper and what they read when they're in the bathroom, for example. - Most people that tried my BB Q10 or any Z10 in kiosk ABSOLUTELY disagree with your statement. They're all biased towards iOS or Android, I know (me too, BTW). But that's how sad the situation is when BB got too late to the consumer market. There's no incentive to switch OS. About teaching Android to a tech illiterate, I always did that to several 65+ years people in my neighborhood who never touched a PC in their daily life because it's too complicated for them. In short, BB OS = complicated, Android = easy, iOS = too easy. YMMV. - That's not a big issue now for developers. It's gonna be an issue when most apps (garbage or not) require Kitkat or later. Lack of incentive for devs = lack of enthusiasm for the platform. Winston Compatibility =/= native support. android apps run TERRIBLY on BB10 Cinj To be fair, most Android apps run terribly on Android too. And you're really not missing anything if you're unable to run most of the schlock that infests the play store anyway. Metallinatus Android apps have Google Play Services on Android, which is essential for a hell load of apps to work.... DEVVVV Chen ruined BlackBerry HumbleButBlunt Looks like the stock market disagrees with you. Nate650 The answer is simple: it didn't sell well and the lack of an ecosystem. Being able to run Android apps is not the same as having access to Google Play. ecnjnr I hope Blackberry resolves the performance issues by launch, or I'm reconsidering my purchase. Thanks for the review Jordan Palmer You and me both. ToniCipriani ✓pǝᴉɟᴉɹǝʌ I'm just curious if you guys ever got updates. Some other reviewers stated they got at least 3 updates after receiving the review unit. Jordan Palmer I received a single update after this review went live. So far, it has only fixed some of my cell connectivity issues. Nothing else. Suicide_Note Even if they do that, it's still a mediocre phone. ecnjnr I'm a fan of physical keyboards. This phone is a Moto Z Play with a slightly bigger battery, a newer version of Android, a better camera and a physical keyboard. That's worth $100 to me, but maybe not for you. freshprince_87 Moto Z Play has a bigger battery Nate650 Bigger by a whopping 5 mAh. freshprince_87 Yep. Makes all the difference Miku is Best Vocaloid You can wait for the Moto Mod that will have a physical keyboard. ToniCipriani ✓pǝᴉɟᴉɹǝʌ If they do a portrait version that is. Martin Rios Dude it depends on the market... Yeah say that "virtual keyboards are better than physical keyboards, swipe, etc.) but there are some folks that are waiting for the rise (or maybe it's the hype) for these kind of devices. Also another point is this sentence >>> "people who use their phones more for communication rather than media consumption, people who are tired of having the same one as everyone else, people who are professionals and rely on their phone to get things done, and people who are looking for something durable that will last through a busy day" >>> I'M ONE OF THEM. I can give less than a f*ck about aesthetics, ceramic look and all that crap, what I want is to be able to comfortably reply my company emails, open docs, scan paperwork, take crisp photos on the field and not sweating the cold if the phone ever slips from my hand (which I doubt). Sure phone must pass through IT Dept to block lost of sh!t like social media but I have my personal phone for that. I'm hoping a OEM in the near future release a phone with nowadays hardware and inspired by a Nokia E7-00, by the way that's my company device (I rejected a trashy Samsung Grand Prime the company tried to make me use, instead I went to Ebay and got a cheap yet efficient Nokia with a horizontal keyboard, Symbian, a decent camera and EAS capabilities). Nate650 Yea, it's a big issue. I still experience performance issues on my Priv. The Priv would be such an amazing device if they address those issues, but it's already been over a year old and they haven't. Do employees even use their own phones? They have to know about these issues by now. Kawshik Ahmed Does the stock 'Blackberry Launcher' supports Android 7.1's 'Launcher Shortcuts' or you have to use a 3rd party launcher ?? Muzaffar I don't understand that BB named it KEYone instead of Mercury. Venice also looks promising at first but becomes flop latter. Nate650 The name is the least of their problems. The performance issues and price are more important. Muzaffar That's why it becomes a flop. paul4tA I skimmed most of the review and went straight to the performance, because if they haven't fixed that from the PRIV, nothing else matters. I love my physical keyboard and have actually come to appreciate some of the other features over time, but I don't think I can take another year of the terrible performance, waiting sometimes minutes for the software to catch up with me. Nate650 It's interesting that not all the reviews mentioned poor performance. That leads me to believe there is a particular culprit and that it's fixable. Jordan L 2 things: I need this on Verizon for one of my bosses, and where can I buy it? Jordan Palmer Updated the buy link. It's up in the specs. BB will be releasing a CDMA version sometime near the end of the month, I think. John Just hold off for 10 years or so until Blackberry's keyboard patents expire and we'll see it put to use by more competent manufacturers. HumbleButBlunt BB doesn't manufacture devices anymore. Cuvis They still hold the patents, and license them to TCL. HumbleButBlunt Yep, that is very true. Licensing out patents isn't manufacturing though and the initial comment was specific to manufacturers. Cuvis Not really. The poster was talking about Blackberry's keyboard patents expiring, and the comment about manufacturers could be talking about Blackberry's current licensees (ie TCL) rather than Blackberry itself. ToniCipriani ✓pǝᴉɟᴉɹǝʌ Probably earlier, when someone somewhere somehow leaks it China and other knockoff makers start building them. RickMLA Battery pull. Fixes everything. Francois Nguyen Battery is non-removable on the KEYone... ToniCipriani ✓pǝᴉɟᴉɹǝʌ Hold the power button for 32 seconds = Battery Pull Reset. JL It´s incredibly horrible! Dragos Lucian So Blackberry is starting to be like an ass itch, and I bet the majority doesn't like that feel. And while we're at it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rla7wt8wKGM djinn123 Just because you don't like PKB's it doesn't mean they aren't for someone else. I'm tired of hearing "who uses PKBs these days" or to that effect. If you can't understand why some people NEED it, then maybe you can just stfu? Stefan Seidel Is the keyboard touch sensitive like on the Priv? That's by far the most favourite feature on my Priv, and I'm sad everytime it doesn't work in an app. Also, as to add something useful to the physical versus virtual keyboard discussion: - multi-lingual virtual keyboards have only come up recently. I frequently write in different languages, and having to manually switch between them just doesn't work (especially when sometimes you insert a word from another language in the middle of a sentence) - I am a Sysadmin and every so often I do need to get in to some server from my phone. Doing that with a on-screen keyboard is nothing short of having a hot iron stamp on your forehead. Having the full screen AND quick and easy access to non-alphanumeric characters is such a huge plus that it would justify any price (if you need it for work/serious business). I agree that using Swype or Gboard with swiping is pretty darn good when it comes down to just blurting out some natural language. Anything beyond that is a pain. Hamilton Jimenez Vasquez I think physical keyboards are way better than touchscreen keyboards, but.... I wouldnt switch my large 5.7 and beautiful screen just to have a nicer keyboard, not in this world. Not sir. dabug91 So annoyed that this phone even exists. Blackberry needs to do the world a favor and permanently exit the smartphone business. They should have closed shop more than 6 years ago. Nate650 And how would that benefit you? Martins Nkem AndroidPolice and the rest needs to start pairing phones and reviewers better. What good does it do when the reviewer has already made up his mind about the device before trying it out. tonkerdog1 . I've had mine since Saturday and love it. I've only charged it twice! The keyboard is great, and the shortcuts are fantastic. Coming from apple I love the hub and the extra security is a nice to have. The camera is very nearly as good as my S7 edge, and I much prefer the textile rear. Who cares about 32gb of internal storage, when an extra 64gb costs about £10. People keep on harping on about the specs of the processor, but I genuinely haven't noticed much of a difference between it and my S7. The S7 in benchmarks is much faster, but just like a car it'll be much faster to run out of battery too.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Sunday, 14 May 2017 | MYT 11:00 AM In Silicon Valley, even mobile homes are getting too pricey for longtime residents by tracey lien Pavlick outside her mobile home in the Plaza del Rey park. She is leading a rent control campaign in Sunnyvale, California. — Los Angeles Times/TNS SUNNYVALE, California: During the last week of March, Apple reached a record market value of US$754bil (RM3.27tril), Google tweaked a policy to protect its US$22bil (RM95.60bil)-a-quarter advertising business and Yahoo inched toward closing a US$4.83bil (RM20.98bil) sale.  Meanwhile, Judy Pavlick drove around her Sunnyvale, California, mobile home park collecting plastic bottles and empty drink cans to save her future.  At a recycling rate of five to 10 cents a bottle, the 70-year-old's attempt to raise US$10,000 (RM43,455) to campaign for a rent control measure seemed like a long shot. But living in the heart of Silicon Valley – where rents keep soaring, outside interests are encroaching and protections for renters are scant – what else was she going to do?  "People are looking for somebody to save them, and they're not looking to themselves," said Pavlick, a retiree who has lived in the Plaza del Rey mobile home park since 1989.  The mobile home park sits on more than 65 acres of some of California's hottest real estate. Its 800 tidy modular homes are less than 2 miles from the campuses of Apple, Google, Yahoo and LinkedIn. One of the world's largest private equity firms, the Carlyle Group, bought the land two years ago for US$151.1mil (RM656.60mil). And in its first year owning the park, it increased space rents (the amount that homeowners pay to lease land) by 7.5% – the largest in Plaza del Rey's 47-year history.  Pavlick knows how this goes. She's not going to wait to be priced out. She's rallying her neighbours: Plastics. Cans. Put 'em out, now.  To live in the Bay Area is to face skyrocketing rents, threats of displacement and evictions. It's to hear about techies moving in, to hear about even techies being priced out. It's to watch glistening tech campuses go up as the gulf between those who make the tech and those who just happen to be here widens.  "When people think Silicon Valley, they think 'pot of gold,'" said Dorothy Niblock, 90, a Plaza del Rey resident who lives alone in the two-bedroom mobile home she designed with her late husband 44 years ago. "That doesn't really apply to us."  Most of Sunnyvale's dozen or so mobile home parks started as retirement communities, and nearly half remain that way. Plaza del Rey is now a family park, but its retirement roots linger: Seniors make up the bulk of its population.  Its monthly newsletter includes a calendar of activities such as Mahjong Tuesdays, Bridge Club Wednesdays and exercise groups four days a week. On Valentine's Day, there was a spaghetti dinner in the main clubhouse. On St Patrick's Day, it was corned beef and cabbage. "Please bring your own plates and utensils," the flier read. "We will be serving water, but feel free to BYOB!"  Many longtime residents have never thought of themselves as part of the Silicon Valley story. But sometimes, you don't get to choose.  The most recent tech boom created staggering job growth in the region, with real estate brokers estimating that firms such as Google and Apple now occupy around nine times the amount of land they did in 2005. The expansion of companies such as Facebook, LinkedIn and Microsoft – along with the tens of thousands of employees they attract – has also significantly increased demand for real estate in the area.  One-bedroom homes in the Sunnyvale area have gone from a median selling price of US$205,000 (RM890,827) in 2012 to more than US$445,000 (RM1.93mil) in 2017. Apartments have over the last four years seen double-digit rent increases. Teachers have been priced out of the school districts where they teach. Even lawyers have left the region in a huff. And as investors still keen to park their money in Silicon Valley look for ways to squeeze value out of what's already there, no property is getting a free pass – not even mobile home parks.  On her first day driving around the park, Pavlick collected 10 bags of bottles and cans. Total Value: US$40.  "Next Thursday, how about 20 donations?" she wrote to Plaza del Rey's Nextdoor community forum.  It costs only US$200 (RM869) to file the initial paperwork to get a measure on the ballot in Sunnyvale. But getting a ballot measure passed is more expensive and difficult, said Juliet Brodie, an attorney who represented the Mountain View Tenants Coalition in its successful push for rent control last year.  Proponents have to publish a notice of intent in local newspapers, get the ballot measure written, gather signatures of at least 10% of the city's eligible voters and win a majority of votes. Printing costs alone can push costs into the thousands of dollars.  "You can't just take a notepad and get signatures," Brodie said.  When Pavlick bought her home in 1989, she paid US$65,000 (RM282,457) plus US$356 (RM1,547) in monthly space rent, which also included water, garbage, sewage and cable. She was a business systems analyst, working for companies such as Memorex and Genentech. The park was close to her job, and its affordability meant that she could get a two-bedroom, allowing her to care for her late mother, who had Alzheimer's disease.  The original owners kept Plaza del Rey in the family for more than four decades until granddaughter Shereen Caswell sold it to Carlyle in 2015 (Caswell could not be reached for comment).  Today, Pavlick pays US$1,004 (RM4,362) for space rent, the result of incremental rent increases over nearly 30 years. Residents now cover the cost of all utilities, in addition to personal property taxes and the cost of maintaining their homes, patios and yards. On top of doubling the space rent increase in 2016 from previous years (residents have long paid increases of 3% to 4% a year, comparable to neighbouring parks), Carlyle raised the space rents for new residents to US$1,600 (RM6,952), nearly 40% more than the park average.  Earlier this year the firm offered residents a five-year lease that would cap rent increases at 4% a year, but only if they also agreed to sign a contract that would give Carlyle the right to make the first bid if a homeowner decided to sell. Carlyle declined to comment on the rent increases or its plans for the park after the five-year period is up. As of May, around 70% of residents have signed the lease. Those who have not signed might see rents increase to market value – Carlyle declined to define what this would be.  Mobile home owners face a "double whammy," according to housing lawyers, because unlike traditional homeowners, they don't own the land beneath their houses. That means they can't expect a windfall when they sell. Newer, larger mobile homes can go for as much as US$400,000 (RM1.73mil), according to local Realtors, but older homes in the park can sell for as little as US$120,000 (RM521,460). Recent space rent increases have hurt homeowners looking to sell because Realtors estimate that for every US$100 (RM434) increase in space rent, a home loses US$10,000 (RM43,455) in value.  And unlike renters, who can easily up and leave, mobile home owners are saddled with a house that is, despite the name, difficult to move. Some homes exceed 1,800 square feet, with multiple bedrooms and bathrooms. Many are brought into the park in pieces and built on site. Taking apart and transporting a mobile home can cost tens of thousands of dollars. Putting one back together can cost even more. And once a home has been uprooted, homeowners have to find a new space for it.  "Just move, just move," said Pavlick, mimicking those who believe that the solution to her problem is to leave. "Move where?"  Mobile home parks have traditionally been mom-and-pop operations. But as the value of land in Silicon Valley soars, a growing number of institutional investors have been eyeing its undervalued lots.  That includes private equity firms. Private equity investors typically snatch up struggling or undervalued businesses and find ways to increase their value – either by investing resources to beef up the business or cutting costs to improve the bottom line – then reselling them at a profit.  Carlyle spokesman Randall Whitestone told the Los Angeles Times that the publicly traded Washington, D.C., firm, which has US$162bil (RM703.97bil) in assets under management across industries such as health care, aerospace, real estate and financial services, has been buying up mobile home parks because they're "less volatile than many other asset classes."  "We like to buy in locations where there are good supply-demand fundamentals and economic strength," Whitestone said.  Because of zoning rules, there is little chance that Plaza del Rey will one day become a tech campus. But there are other ways to raise the value of the park.  Investors can upgrade a park before they sell it. Although Carlyle declined to comment on its long-term plans for the park, Whitestone said it has "made significant capital investments to materially improve the property for residents."  Another way is to increase the rent.  Plaza del Rey is, to the dismay of many longtime residents, an ideal investment for Carlyle. In a place like Silicon Valley, where tech salaries are among the highest in the country and the housing market is among the most competitive, it won't be hard to find someone willing to pay US$1,600 (RM6,952) or more for space rent. And according to private equity experts, it doesn't matter to Carlyle who that someone might be.  "They won't care if it's seniors or young people," said Erik Gordon, a professor at the University of Michigan's Ross School of Business. "Their challenge is to turn something they bought for US$100mil (RM434.55mil) into something that's worth US$300mil (RM1.30bil). That's the end game for a private equity fund."  This gives Carlyle reason to fear rent control. Any caps to rent increases would not only limit the park's near-term profitability but also potentially reduce its future resale value, which is where private equity firms make most of their profit.  And that's why Carlyle sent its managing director of US real restate, Dave Kingery, to a Sunnyvale City Council meeting in January to argue against rent control.  "We do not believe it furthers the objectives of the city, the residents or the owners in the long term," Kingery said at the meeting.  The firm's annual earnings reports spelled it out more plainly: Under the "risks" heading, which details all the things that could hurt Carlyle's business, the tenth bullet point reads "changes in government regulations (such as rent control)."  Depending on who you talk to, rent control either always works or it never works. It's the answer to the housing affordability crisis. It's the reason that homes are so expensive. It will deter developers from creating more housing stock. It will keep people in their homes. It has never solved a city's problems. It's the answer to residents' prayers.  Although Silicon Valley communities have either resisted or been slow to develop new housing to accommodate the influx of workers the region has attracted over the years, Sunnyvale has one of the strongest track records in California when it comes to building affordable housing. About 10% of the units in its development pipeline are affordable housing units.  But it's also one of the few cities in Silicon Valley that doesn't have rent control, either citywide or specifically for mobile home parks, and its City Council has shown a reluctance to entertain the thorny issue.  "The problem I have is there are a lot of loopholes in rent control, and we're going to have a lot of lawsuits the moment it goes through," council member Michael Goldman said in an interview with the Los Angeles Times.  The neighbouring city of Mountain View, which passed a voter-approved measure in November, was slapped with a lawsuit from the California Apartment Association seeking to block the measure from being enforced immediately after the election. A Santa Clara County judge in April denied the request for an injunction, clearing the way for the city to go ahead with its rent control rollout.  "This is a free country and anybody with a filing fee can file a lawsuit," said Brodie, the attorney who helped Mountain View get rent control. "If we allow that to prevent us from making good policy, that's just not reasonable."  For housing advocates, rent control is good policy. For opponents, it's a Band-Aid solution. Rents are high, they argue, not just because landlords can charge whatever they want, but because Silicon Valley became a global tech mecca faster than its cities could handle it. How do you solve that?  "There are no bad guys in all this," Goldman said of Carlyle and Plaza del Rey. "When I see people saying 'It's really expensive for me,' I say if you're not working in high tech, which requires you to be here, why are you here? If you're here, you're making a decision every minute you're here that the cost of being here is worth it."  There are tech industry workers who live in Plaza del Rey – employees of Apple, Google, Oracle and local startups. They're increasingly feeling the squeeze too.  Despite making a six-figure salary working in information technology, a traditional home was out of reach for Bay Area native Ron Van Scherpe, 45. Having a young family, he didn't want to rent anymore. So he and his wife did what they thought was the next best thing: They bought a three-bedroom home in Plaza del Rey.  When they moved in 12 years ago, their combined mortgage and space rent was only US$2,150 (RM9,342). Today, it's US$2,600 (RM11,298), which is still more affordable than the rent on a one-bedroom Sunnyvale apartment. But if the space rent keeps climbing, at some point they'll be no different from renters.  "The tech industry is displacing the middle class," said Van Scherpe, who has signed up to help Pavlick in her rent control effort. "We're going to give it two years with this rent control issue, and if it doesn't look promising, we're going to have to relocate by the end of five years."  He and his wife are considering Austin, Texas. He worries that it will be hard on his kids, though. Their grandparents live here.  On a recent Thursday morning, Pavlick drove around Plaza del Rey with her neighbours Patrick and Karen Garcia picking up heavy glass bottles of Perrier and empty cans of Coca-Cola.  "Someone must have had a party," Karen Garcia said.  At the recycling facility, they traded the goods for US$46.55 (RM202.28).  Pavlick frowned. "I thought we'd get more from those heavy bottles," she said. "But it's more than last week."  "Enough to pay for a third of an hour with an attorney!" Garcia joked.  Pavlick did the math in her head. If Plaza del Rey averaged US$40 (RM173) in recycling a week, and the dozen or so mobile home parks in Sunnyvale also got involved and raised US$40 (RM173) a week, they could collectively raise everything they needed in less than six months.  She currently has around 115 people from Plaza del Rey and neighbouring parks working with her. In the coming weeks she hopes that more people will put out their recycling, knock on doors and, eventually, campaign for rent control.  It's a long shot: a few dozen mobile home park residents trying to stop a private equity firm from upending their lives. But Pavlick likes to say aloud: "Carlyle has the money, but we have the people."  Now she just needs those people to knock on doors, push for rent control and fight for their future – one plastic bottle at a time. — Los Angeles Times/Tribune News Service Related Stories You May Be Interested Airlines fret about laptop ban from Europe during peak season Can technology make your kid fat, dumb, and mean?

Google's "Project Treble" will modularize Android to make updates faster Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/05/12 12:42pm PDTMay 12, 2017 95 Plus 1 on G+ 162 Share on Facebook 76 Share on Twitter Total Shares333 Android O Android OS Development Google News Easily the most annoying aspect of using an Android phone (with the exception of Pixel/Nexus) is slow updates. Android 7.1 (which came out last year) currently sits at 0.5% marketshare, and brand new phones are still being released with 6.0 Marshmallow. Google is aiming to solve this with "Project Treble," which will modularize part of the Android OS to decrease the time OEMs spend updating their devices. If you're not familiar with how Android updates work, here's a summary. Google releases a new Android version, which silicon manufacturers (e.g. Qualcomm, Mediatek) have to supply drivers for. Once that's done, device makers (e.g. Samsung, HTC) can start re-adding all the tweaks they have made to the new Android source code. In the case of carrier-sold phones/tablets, device makers then have to wait for the carriers to approve the update. After all that is done, users finally start to receive the update. Google is hoping to speed up this process with Project Treble, which changes the architecture of Android. Essentially, a new 'Vendor interface' will contain all of the low-level software for a device - like the chipset drivers. Google will work with chipset manufacturers to make sure the Vendor interface is forwards-compatible, and the interface will be validated by a Vendor Test Suite (VTS). The aspect of this news I'm most excited about is that the Vendor interface is forwards-compatible. There have been many cases where chipset manufacturers have not updated drivers for specific popular chips, preventing devices using them from being officially updated to newer Android versions. One example is the Nexus 5 and other Snapdragon 800/801-based devices, which were never officially updated to 7.0 Nougat. It sounds like the Vendor interface will prevent this from happening, or at least prolong the end of support for a given chip. Google says that Android O will be the first version to use the new Vendor interface, and the Android O Developer Preview already has it. Hopefully we'll hear more about Project Treble at Google I/O next week. Source: Android Developers Tags Android android o project treble treble vendor interface vendor test suite vts subscribe ...

Hopefully this means Google can update more core system functions similar to Google Play Services independent of the OEM/carrier path. Mike Updates still have to go through carriers, this just helps prevent devices from early EoL and should make OEMs jobs easier by not having to rewrite every piece of code to work with new drivers. TechGuy22 that's why this is useless. carriers are still involve and OEM like samsung takes time with their own skin destinyhud thats why i buy pixel. also, like mentioned this will reduce the amount of modification needed in android's new version which means slightly early release. even if its 2 weeks early i am good wit it TechGuy22 or or you can push google to make things easier for carriers and OEMs and not bandages i have an S7 edge and a pixel xl. go figure Taco Monster You can't make things easy for someone who doesn't want to do said things. bekifft It's why I buy Pixel too but the whole point of Android was supposed to be freedom and choice. If my only real choices are Google or Apple, I might as well buy a damn iPhone. PI This Daniel Not necessarily. All the OEM has to do is bring their crap (skin) from the last android version. Of course that probably only happen with small android updates (8.1?) Zsolt V Why shouldn't they? By all accounts, they add value so it's worth the wait. CA-Sandra Fuchsia is a very long term project. It's not going to replace Android anytime soon. Dextro I've been saying for ages that Android needs an hardware abstraction in the vein of what Windows has in its driver model. Hopefully this is it and helps get those updates out faster. Sadly I expect that the endless stream of UI customization OEM make will end up killing any kind of benefit this brings. Corbin Davenport I want something like that too, but I'm not deeply familiar with the technical structure of Linux/Android, so I would assume sure there some massive limitation that is keeping that from happening. Dextro I think (but am now 100% sure on this so don't quote me) that Linux historically hasn't had any such abstraction. Drivers are meant to be inside the kernel and compiled for each specific version. That works fine if the code is open source and committed to the kernel repos but it becomes a nightmare for binary blobs. The kernel makes no allowances for stable driver APIs, they will break stuff and won't worry for anything outside of the kernel if I remember correctly. That's probably part of the reason why Android has failed to keep up with Linux kernel versions. keithzg The kernel makes no allowances for stable driver APIs, they will break stuff and won't worry for anything outside of the kernel if I remember correctly. I wouldn't really say this is true. In fact, there is a very stable API provided by the Linux kernel. Hell, one of the most famous Linus rants was about this very topic: It's a bug alright - in the kernel. How long have you been a maintainer? And you *still* haven't learnt the first rule of kernel maintenance? If a change results in user programs breaking, it's a bug in the kernel. We never EVER blame the user programs. How hard can this be to understand? WE DO NOT BREAK USERSPACE! https://lkml.org/lkml/2012/12/23/75 Obviously drivers are trickier, but they're still expected to continue working. The big catch comes in that ARM drivers tend to come as compiled binary blobs. There really isn't an allowance for that in the workflow of things for Linux; good citizens are supposed to provide source, and then new kernel versions and the drivers therefore (often within the kernel itself) are recompiled, and everyone's happy. But while the API remains the same, the ABI does not; drivers compiled as modules for an older kernel won't work on newer ones, even though the drivers would almost certainly work fine if they were recompiled. The ARM space is utterly lousy with proprietary drivers (in no small part this is Qualcomm's fault, although they're far from the only offender). Hence you have Google forever backporting kernel updates to older kernels, so that the ABI remains consistent and older device drivers continue working. Dextro Well, I stand corrected then. But one question then: I was under the impression that drivers were not in userspace but in kernelspace. That's why I didn't even think much of that famous Linus rant. keithzg True, they're (generally; FUSE, for instance, is an area of exception) in kernel space, and that rant isn't entirely applicable because of that, but for practical purposes that just means ABI changes break drivers. And the kernel devs do reserve the right to change the in-kernel API at any point, which could in theory break drivers---it's just that in practice they are rather worried about such breakage and don't wish to do so, and barely break it more than they do userspace. When you think about it, it'd kindof be an insane amount of maintenance if people had to update driver code for new kernel versions! Luckily for "desktop Linux", most drivers these days in the x86 space are open source (NVIDIA is remaining holdout, although even there you can fall back to the Nouveau drivers most of the time), so they're just baked into the kernel or provided as kernel modules, and in practice don't really have to be touched by human hands after they're originally written. Unluckily for Android, that is very much not true in the ARM hardware world. Hell, most Chinese OEMs will just flatly refuse to provide kernel source, even though they're legally obligated to do so. Gaurav Kumar Which is why fuchsia has a stable ABI...like windows. I agree it's not coming anytime soon but it may not be that far away as well.. Lawstorant in the linux world, the answer is DKMS. There's no need for kernel catch-up anymore. I bet Google is doing something similar. Сергей Бугаев Android has the HAL https://source.android.com/devices/#Hardware-Abstraction-Layer -- but it haven't been helping much, as we can see (or would it be much worse without it?). It'd be interesting to see more technical details about Tremble to understand how it's different. Andy J https://developer.android.com/things/index.html pretty much this is what they are aiming for - from the days of Project Brillo. "System updates and support: We provide the system image, updates, fixes, and more, so you can focus on creating compelling products" Brillo/Things is the same idea - there is the low level vendor stuff, the actual OS and then the OEM stuff. Google can update the OS on running devices in the field, without worrying about the vendor stuff or the OEM stuff. Knowledgeborn Allah Exactly... And, unfortunately, this probably isn't going to be anything like Microsoft's new update process for Windows 10 Mobile, which doesn't have to go through carriers. Based on all the software modifications most Android OEMs make with their devices, this probably won't speed up OS updates at all. More powerful devices may last slightly longer, but that will still leave it to the OEMs to support those devices for longer periods, and they likely won't do that anyway, since they're constantly trying to get you to purchase the next one... Zsolt V Windows 10 what? Knowledgeborn Allah Dismissing Windows 10 Mobile (and rightly so) doesn't change the fact that Android needs to learn a few things from them. Their update process, at least right now, is still miles ahead of anything Android is doing. Google should've followed the path that Microsoft already laid when it comes to updating software systems outside of the carriers. It looks like they took one thing that's beneficial but disregarded all the other necessary parts... ¯_(ツ)_/¯ Zsolt V As in how to drop 50% of the devices with the Creators update? No, thanks, Google has nothing to learn from that process. Knowledgeborn Allah Again, you're still missing the point... This isn't about dropping support for any devices with the Creators' update. This is specifically about them bypassing carriers to directly deliver updates to their consumers, which they can sustain for longer periods of time. Google has a lot to learn from that process. Zsolt V Doesn't matter. The end result is the same, the user doesn't get an update. You are missing the point, maybe you don't have one? Knowledgeborn Allah Maybe I don't have one? You sound like an idiot, bud... Maybe you have difficulty reading. I specifically stated in my original post, which you replied to, what the point was: "And, unfortunately, this probably isn't going to be anything like Microsoft's new update process for Windows 10 Mobile, which doesn't have to go through carriers." Again, the point was based on the fact that Windows 10 Mobile updates - regardless of how many people actually have Windows 10 Mobile devices, or how many devices will be discontinued due to the Creators' update - don't have to go through carriers. That's the point. Android as a platform can learn a lot from that. Before making ridiculous replies about a subject and, in effect, making yourself look dumb, maybe you should read the post you're replying to first. Just a thought. PVL_93_RU Windows 10 mobile is dead Knowledgeborn Allah https://www.onmsft.com/news/latest-windows-10-mobile-updates-bypass-carriers-update-phones-directly Say what your want about Windows 10 Mobile when it comes to development, but it's definitely not a good look when a "dead" platform can update their devices better than Android can. 🤦🏾‍♂️ Robabobbob So which windows phone OEM is actually making a modification anything close to what android OEMs do? Knowledgeborn Allah That's not the point... The point is that you can separate core Android OS functions from the themes and launchers inherent in other variations of Android provided by other OEMs. Right now, Android's update process is a disaster. Even after the OEMs push out updates to their devices, it still has to go through various carriers to actually get to consumers, showing that the carriers are actually the ones in charge. Windows 10 doesn't have that problem. iOS doesn't have that problem. Android has that problem. bekifft I agree completely about the HAL, but the real problem remains the network operators retaining strict control over user devices. If AT&T doesn't want to spend the money to add AT&T Navigator, AT&T Device Locator, AT&T Messages, etc etc etc, they will simply not deploy the update. SomeGuy112 This is great, gives the potential for much longer OS update support, especially for Googles own hardware. Hopefully the OG Pixel gets longer than 2 year OS support because of this. destinyhud good point Dn Bro Didn't the article say the new devices with O will have this? DragoCubed The dev preview for the pixel has this project. We can assume it's staying with the pixel MrHanMan So, is it Trebble, or Treble? Jdban Treble according to the google docs Corbin Davenport It is Treble, I can't spell. Fixed. Jeff The trouble with Trebbles... destinyhud i really hope this fixes the 2 week delay in getting major update to nexus devices /s John Doe This is good but Google need to do more. They need to modularize everything in the Android update process. Create a separate carrier update so the baseband can be updated separate from the OS and same to drivers and also OEM skins/Apps. This should have FIVE different updates paths: 1) Core OS/Kernel update path 2) Driver update path 3) Baseband/Carrier related Apps update path 4) OEM Skin/Apps path 5) Security update path This way Google can control the Security, Core OS, Baseband, and Drivers by working with carriers and silicon manufacturers. Also if T-Mobile for example wants to push an update out for the baseband and messaging/phone apps they can do that independent of Google and OEMs. The same goes for Samsung and Qualcomm and others. Latheryin You are confused on one part. What you call skins are not what you think they are. All of the OEM versions of android are completely different distros that replace core OS files and frameworks with their versions. John Doe I know but If Google were to modularize it then it would just be a "skin" or "theme" that is separate from the framework/OS this will give Google control over the main OS and the only way to do that is to not allow OEMs to modify it too much. Latheryin Which would remove all the extra features that devices add on. Many have to be tied into the frameworks and other base OS drivers and libs. There is no separation in it really. And with the way they licensed Android they cant really control a whole lot. Any OEM could easily reverse anything Google does and still release it. John Doe Well yeah of course Google can't do that alone they would have to make new agreements with OEMs and carriers. Most OS skins do not have that many extra features and Google can create APIs to allow OEMs to modify anything they want like if Samsung wants to add an Iris scanner as a password or whatever. The point is OEM "skins" need to become more like launchers in the play store like Nova and Apex and If OEMs want to modify something they would have to ask Google like how Microsoft treats windows. Latheryin You really dont have a great understanding of how things work. That will never hap=p=en. Maybe with Googles second mobile OS they might try to have more control. John Doe How about instead of being an arrogant prick, you tell me what I said is incorrect or what Google cannot do? Why do you think this cannot happen? Microsoft did this with Windows mobile. Like I said, Google would have to sign new licensing agreements with OEMs and Carriers but they probably have to revise it for this Project Treble anyways. Google already uses its Apps and Play store as a bargaining chip to update those agreements. Latheryin Ok first. Google would have to change the license under which android is licensed. Which can't be done. Also have you ever ripped Android apart and had a look? I would guess not as if you had we would not be talking about this. As for what we does does. That really is apples and oranges. Not even close e same thing. The apps and play store are not really that big of a deal. There are hundreds of android devices released every year that don't include them and they sell really well. John Doe You said NOTHING I have not said already. Why Google cannot change the Android license? What stops Google from implementing this since you are the Genius that ripped Android apart and decided this cannot be done? Google already has MADAs in place and they update them every few years with OEMs. Those devices are mostly in China since Google services are banned there. If the Play store is not a big deal then Samsung would have forked Android a long time ago. But go ahead I am still waiting for your "intelligent" replies. Even Amazon's fire phone failed miserably without the play store and Google apps. Latheryin Have you even read the license? Do you really have any idea what happens when something is licensed? Doesn't take that much really. Anyone can look at the code. Heck some of the best android developers are teens. Samsung already did. It's called tizen. Also Samsung is not the end all of devices. They even have a separate store for the devices they run with Android. All Samsung apps don't even hit the Play store. They are Android devices for the common man. Made for everyday people. Ask your favorite developer what device he runs. Look if you want to know more why not dig in, instead of trying to get into a tech conversation when you don't really know too much about it. John Doe Licenses can be updated and their MADAs can be updated which they already do. Samsung did not fork Android, they created a different OS. And that is not turning out very well for them. You still have not told me how what I said cannot be implemented. You should go get one of those Teen Android developers to help you out before you just turn down ideas that you have know nothing about. If Google wanted to they can change Android to how Windows does updates there is nothing stopping them from doing that and OEMs will not fork Android if they did that. I love how you just criticize arguments without providing valid reasons instead of just saying Android does not allow you to do that provide factual reasons or STFU. klaus666 Could this also help to port LineageOS to a smartphone once LineageOS is adapted to this new modular system? jgarrido I dunno, sounds like treble to me... JD OK I get that Google is essentially making what in the Windows World is the HAL and breaking that out of the Kernel and they're essentially creating a lower level API (For lack of a better term) to segment off Android from the OEM mods. However what is actually stopping the OEMs from sayin' fuck this ain't working out let me go in there and refork it anyway. I mean API's are there, now and OEMs should be using that to interact with Android but Android is coming up short so they fork it and custom build the ROM with their own customization and branches. For the longest time the camera stack was a HUGE reason for doing this, even now the Camera2 API is still coming up short, which is why Samsung Completely branches on their own for that too. freshprince_87 Google simply needs to make it mandatory for carriers /OEMS to update their devices and release new phones in the most current version of Android Adnoxaei They could make it a requirement for access to the Play store. Without this interface, that would have been very restrictive. With this interface, customizations can still easily exist, so companies may be more willing to cooperate...espevially if it cuts down on the time needed to test and deploy updates boop By the sound of it, the Vendor Interface is for SoC manufacturers, not device makers. jcopernicus Sweet! Can't wait for my Z3 Compact to get this update! NubCake This doesn't sound like a treble idea at all, hopefully it helps the slow updating process. Knowledgeborn Allah I see what you did there... 🙄😂 ddevito No bass.... Tom Westrick But what if a user is all about that bass? Killa Then they might be in treble if that's all they are about. Sorry, couldn't help myself. :P Emergency Medical Hologram Bassed on what? Martheen Cahya Paulo There's plenty of tweeter surrounding it. Dolby so if we consider the stereo type. Testraindrop While this is certainly a step in the right direction, I somehow doubt that this will change Googles attitude to abandon their own devices after 2 years. Its not like the SOC in the Nexus 5 stopped working when N was installed, in fact its working fine, developed by independent individuals without having "to work with chipset manufacturers", which Google apparently couldn't even achieve. Also the times where google stops updates for the N6 and the Pixels is already set, so even with a chipset blob that is "forwards-compatible" there wont be any further (official) updates. Also if those Vendor APIs will have limits to certain OS aspects like camera, sound etc., then manufacturers will not use them and will just fork again the OS as done currently. saf1927 The custom ROMs that work on Nexus 5 devices don't actually benefit from a lot of things that an officially supported device would. Qualcomm has completely abandoned the chip so from a retail perspective, it's not suitable anymore. Even the "security updates" that these ROMs show in "About phone" aren't actually all implemented, since none of the proprietary blobs and binaries could be updated. Just because a device can be updated with a custom ROM, doesn't mean it's actually running it well. someone755 "Just because it's running it well doesn't mean it's running it well." Welp. saf1927 Wait, what? I can't find that sentence anywhere and I don't remember editing the comment. AbdulB1 Mediatek and in some cases​ Qualcomm (for Nexus 5,sd800,801) don't want people to stay on old phones they try to force them to buy new phones for latest Android version. I am not sure will they be happy about this change? I suspect they will flood market with phones running Android nougat instead. They will try to resist this change by Google. saf1927 Mediatek and Qualcomm aren't device makers, they are silicon manufacturers. AbdulB1 Mediatek charges device makers for new drivers for latest Android versions. Qualcomm stopped supporting sd 800/801 for Android Nougat and thus even sony a device maker who was developing Android N developer versions for a SD800/801 stopped. Chipset makers also have huge clout , it not just sensor makers who decide to support or not their older hardware for newer Android release. saf1927 Well, my point is that none of the silicon manufacturers will force anyone to make only Nougat phones, like you claimed. AbdulB1 "Google will work with chipset manufacturers to make sure the Vendor interface is forwards-compatible, and the interface will be validated by a Vendor Test Suite (VTS)." so if Vendor dont get validated for VTS then do you expect any chances of Android O for those devices? dizel123 I suspect if OEMs want to release new phones with the latest OS version because that's what their users want(I know I'm making assumptions) and Mediatek and Qualcomm try to force them to release phones with Nougat, then Intel will suddenly become a dominant player in the mobile market. This would be exactly the kind of "in" they're praying for. AbdulB1 Intel architecture is quite old , I owned 2 Intel based Android tablets. Intel even didn't bothered to upgrade the OS from 4.0.4 and other one had 5.0 as latest release even it though it was buggy as hell and every hardware vendor went for 5.1 instead. Intel had an edge of running windows along android on their cpu tech. But lack of proper built in modem destroyed their chances in Android world. Their SOCs still had quite high consumption even after releasing newer and newer generations of Mobile SOCs. dizel123 I don't have any inside information, but I'm guessing Intel is working on fixing their problems and making high quality SOCs Cakefish Intel dropped out of the mobile SOC wars. It cancelled development of all upcoming chips last year, I believe. dizel123 Their announcement at this year's Mobile World Congress as well as their current road map on their website both indicate that they're still developing mobile SOCs Cakefish So has it changed since this? -> http://www.anandtech.com/show/10288/intel-broxton-sofia-smartphone-socs-cancelled dizel123 Read my last comment again Lateef Alabi-Oki Jesus! What took them so long? pfmiller I believe there are performance costs to adding hardware abstraction. Google may feel that mobile hardware is finally at a point where it's worth the cost. Justin Martin This was my question. What is it going to do to performance. Not that I'm a Samsung user, but how much will touch wiz suck now? AbdulB1 Will it help in churning out custom ROMs? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I actually want the vendors to work on Android itself, not just their layer. They fix a lot of the bugs that Google leaves in. saf1927 They are already working on that: "In addition to the architectural changes, we're working with our silicon and device partners to take their code changes, such as features for a carrier network in a specific country, and move them into the common Android Open Source Project (AOSP) codebase. For example, Sony and Qualcomm contributed dozens of features and hundreds of bugfixes to Android O so they no longer need to rework these patches with each new release of Android." Simply put, some vendors contribute more than others. Sony is a great example in that regard. They contribute a lot. dizel123 This might just be the best thing Google has ever done to Android Eddie Ringle If you want to see more technical details, here's a bit of what I found back in March when the Developer Preview was released: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13928385 SHunter Orrrrr.... https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/7b191be55920725d6f6aba09c97c1e1942bdfb290cb4cf53e2cb9e23c706626c.png Eumelanin Knight Better late than never. Let's hope Carriers and Manufactures don't have their way and muck this up some how. bekifft At least they're being up front about the problem finally and making it an official "project." It seems like every year the promise is "we're fixing battery this time" and "we're fixing updates." Every year. Never gets better. And with the current FCC and the network operators only set to get worse about their abusive practices, I don't hold out much hope for this plan. What it boils down to is if there is any possible way for network operators (carriers) to meddle with the update, they will. This practice truly aught to be illegal, but see above. Maybe this will at least help lazy to the point of negligence OEMs (Lenovo) not be so appallingly slow. Islam sounds like a joke to me. John C.S. Lock When you finally giving up on Android after 10 long years , here we come iOS ! charfarstar I'll believe when Pixel 2 comes with 4 years of OS updates. MeCampbell30 Turn the treble up in my headphones. Régis Knechtel OMG! I can't believe they're finally doing something about it! https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/5acada086a36a588b7289e5b2a26d7c5f205e0b15a6c77c9b631f1a387dc8d2a.gif Cypher Hey guys and gals, let's add more abstraction to make this slug of an OS even slower! But hey, at least you'll get more frequent updates so that it can get slower more often! xyz People have been telling Google to use their muscle with the chipset makers forever. Qualcomm didn't release drivers is not an acceptable reason to not update Android. Sir_Brizz Hardware manufacturer doesn't release drivers is a perfectly acceptable reason not to update. Consumers should level their hatred at the right target. Blaming Samsung, for example, for Qualcomm's shortcoming won't change Qualcomm's policies. Andy J So last year it was A/B updates from Project Brillo and this year it's the ability to update the OS independently from the low level chipset drivers and the OEM stuff - which is also something Google developed for Project Brillo. While there are no actual Project Brillo / Android Things products in the market yet - it was definitely a worthwhile project for them with these rewards. (Yes I'm aware Chromebooks had A/B updates - but from everything I have heard, they still came about because of Project Brillo, even if Project Brillo wasn't an actual thing when they found their way to Chromebooks) kelpa32 it take google untill android O to try to get updates on time. Urmil Shroff Am I dreaming? Is this really going to happen? PI -This things don't work as u r expecting it ., Google can make guidelines but cant force OEMs to follow it . Oem will still not pass this ,, they will rant about high testing methods and quality benchmarks , ultimately they will pass it for devices only which they want (flagships) only ,, PVL_93_RU This is huge for Android in general. Of course the ideal way of doing things is following ChromeOS model where Google is entirely in charge of managing and updating the software, but then we'd lose out on what makes android unique, which is OEM skins Still though, modular updates are hopefully the next step that will really accelerate how fast devices receive OS updates. Especially mid-range and budget models Patel Nisha I swear I see something like this for every release but yet never happens Paul It's all fine and dandy but I suspect most phone companies still wont upgrade them because they want us to upgrade to newer phones so keeping older phones on older firmwares is in their interest so I don't think much will change. In any event, I'm happy that Google is doing this because it's one less excuse phone companies have to not upgrade their phones, but personally, I think Android could do with something like what Windows does with upgrades so almost any hardware can upgrade to the latest Androids without the manufaturas getting in the way. TonGi018 This is really exciting news! Android Developer Will this also lead to more updates, over a longer period of time ? boop Potentially, as it eliminates the forced EoL when the SoC manufacturer drops support, but it's still up to OEM and Carriers to develop and distribute updated. Android Developer Maybe for Google Pixel , at least? Maybe more than 2 years of updates?

Fragmentation is arguably Android’s biggest problem, but in a post on the Android Developers Blog this Friday, Google revealed a new feature in Android O that will supposedly “make it easier, faster and less costly for manufacturers to update devices to a new version of Android.” Don't Miss: You can’t stop people from calling you on your Amazon Echo Google says that the new feature, dubbed Project Treble, represents “the biggest change to the low-level system architecture of Android to date.” As it stands, a lot of code has to be rewritten across Android before a given vendor can update its devices to the latest version of the software. With Project Treble, vendors will be able to roll out Android updates without having to wait for chip manufacturers such as Qualcomm to modify the code to work with their chips. The entire process will be streamlined so that vendors can get Android 8.0 (and beyond) in the hands of consumers more quickly than they’ve been able to in the past. That’s what Google is promising, anyway. Google has not been blind to the fragmentation issue over the past several years. The company has ensured Android users on multiple occasions that it’s working on solutions, but considering that just 7.1% of users are on Android 7.0 Nougat while nearly 20% are still on Android 4.4 KitKat, the success on this front has clearly been limited up to this point. Google says that Project Treble is already running on the Android O Developer Preview for Pixel phones, but we’ll have to wait until the new version of Android begins rolling out to judge its efficacy.

[Minority Report] Google and Coca-Cola may target personalized ads at you - in real life Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/05/10 11:27am PDTMay 10, 2017 23 Plus 1 on G+ 46 Share on Facebook 50 Share on Twitter Total Shares119 News Videos Google and Coca-Cola's partnership effort for in-store advertising displays looks to be bearing fruit. The advertising system uses DoubleClick's preference and tracking data combined with Google's Beacon Platform to serve up targeted ads by pulling data from passing smartphones. With that info, displays are able to select content based on your preferences in the form of advertisements specifically targeted to passersby. In a recent grocery store pilot program the Minority Report-style ads performed quite very well. This isn't actually that new. It was discussed at a few places in the last couple months since the details were revealed at Google's conference. But, it seems to have quite effectively flown under the radar for that time, considering how cool it is. Coca-Cola made a detailed post about it on one of their social promotion sites in April as well, in which they talked about the potential environments for these tracking signage systems, like movie theaters and other Retail venues than just grocery stores. Google's partnership with Coca-Cola for this system has been discussed off-and-on for a few years. Back at the National Automatic Merchandising Association's OneShow in 2016 Google talked about the potential as applied to vending machines, and said that Google and Coca-Cola were working together on Bluetooth beacons for vending, but this is the first time I've actually gotten to see what it looks like and how it performs. Coca-Cola's Greg Chambers, at Google's recent Cloud Next Conference, said that it has been experimenting with small tests into proximity marketing since at least 2015 when they first started working with Google on a prototype. The two companies tested things with a pilot for the system in 250 Albertson's grocery stores, in which Coca-Cola saw some incredible results. There was a one year ROI on Coca-Cola products displayed by the system, and a spillover effect from so-called "category-lift," in the form of a total one-month ROI for all nearby soda products — i.e., this system sells a lot of soda for Coca-Cola and all other brands near it. There's no word yet on when or how Coca-Cola might roll this out to other stores, but given how positive the results were for the pilot tests, it is likely you'll see one someday at the end of the soda aisle in your local grocery. On a more technical note, I'm not sure exactly what sort of data is being sent to the displays by nearby phones or how it is taken. Allegedly the system uses Google's Eddystone beacons, which exchange information with nearby phones using Bluetooth low energy. This is the first time I've heard of Google's Beacon Platform actually being used, combined with DoubleClick's targeting advertising systems, to target people in the physical world. The privacy-conscious might express some concern at the potential of having your phone communicate your preferences to an in-store display, but I would hope and assume that any identifying information is stripped out. Either way, we're one step closer to this. Source: Digital Strategy Consulting Tags beacon platform beacons bluetooth low energy Coca-Cola Eddystone Targeted advertisements video subscribe ...

Anu6is Stop being absurd, how else would you know what you NEED? WesleySmalls Actually, you do. People require social interaction, it's a very strong part of our being. Humans generally don't like to be alone, and very much can't over longer periods of time. Because of this, people tend to follow each other's example in one way or another, advertising is just one of the many examples Ben Yeah, your phone communicating with a vending machine to give you personalised advertisements is not in any way 'social interaction'. WesleySmalls I did not say anything about that, it wasn't even remotely close, nor was the post I commented on. But of course, else you had to actually comment on my actual post, and realize that it's true that people follow other people Prezes Dyrektor But you are making it sound like advertising is indispensable in our lives. Well guess what, ads is the reason why I cut cable tv, they don't have those fancy adblockers. Ads is the reason I mostly listen to local academic radio without any. Etc. Ads and marketing are evil, and we are being manipulated every day. Now excuse me as I run to grab some sugar soda and candy. xyz Your second sentence was "People require social interaction". It seems you didn't bother reading your own comment. WesleySmalls Indeed, that was a art of my comment, which was a reply to a comment that wasnt about any digital technologies. Ryne Hager https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKlSVNxLB-A xyz "Humans generally don't like to be alone, and very much can't over longer periods of time." Right, that's why we have these things called friends and family. I mean if ads are your way making the loneliness go away, good for you.

Fadakar lol if you think your record is clean you need to re-evaluate how seriously you want to take privacy. James F This. People underestimate how much of a digital footprint they leave, even if they do turn off everything. EowynCarter True. And if they are, they wouldn't show me ads for coca cola, I just don't like that. And sodas in general. Cakefish Agreed, if I have to endure advertising it might as well be about products that actually interest me. Bewear I am a fan of your picture edits, Ryne. Ryne Hager What a coincidence, I am also a fan of your work. I kept a Bewear in my party for most of Moon. Anu6is lol! Lord Argyris My party was boring. Two of them were from Gen I, and apart from my starter, only one other member was from Gen VII. Now really, Nintendo should get in on this whole Coke-Google partnership thing. Maybe put something in their 3DS games that ties into this advertising platform. "Oh, so you're raising a bunch of Fire-type Pokemon. I'll bet you're feeling pretty hot right about now. Know what would cool you right down? A nice, ice cold COKE." Ryne Hager I mean, with the launch event Munchlax and Munchlax/Snorlax available on the first island, who in their right mind didn't take a Gen I Snorlax to end game. Michael Oghia I came here just to give you a +1 for Hypno Toad. Steve Actually noticed this happening to me recently when near the vending machine at my job. Guessing the capabilities will be endless and more diverse when full-on set-ups are placed everywhere. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/7ea9fde9939850ddee856f08d34c3e8a98a6c90461c779f049060ec4e655b8c6.png https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/f87dc3afe5a1492c33e179552b9fcf3259d388ef4a1a6cfed7951d9612faeae6.png https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/da689e538e0681368f0ef1dac408a796aa111781564a9ded426c4639fbeab351.jpg F4LL0U7 Disabling Nearby will disable invasive ads, you say? Done! Morten Ulv Google usually have a way to opt out. james fuston https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPGgTy5YJ-g Ben Nothing better than a new way to sell people tooth-rotting, diabetes-causing sugar water. Nicholas Conrad *This* is the gateway to AR! Aing actual R; genius! abqnm Are these connected to the "Nearby" activity in Google Settings? (Which also interestingly enough at some point has earned the ability to add the Nearby activity directly to the homescreen. Don't know when it appeared as I don't open that screen often, but it's now an option in the overflow menu.) James F Beacons typically use Bluetooth. abqnm Yes, and Google's Nearby uses Bluetooth LE scanning and Play Services location. But with Google being a part of it, I'm asking if it is directly related to the Nearby function. I am not asking for how beacons typically work. MJ Double checked BT is off on my phone... The only time ever use it is when play music on a BT speaker which I don't do when grocery shopping. "With that info, displays are able to select content based on your preferences in the form of advertisements specifically targeted to passersby" How does these ads work exactly? I am not watching a 54min video. Dedren You don't need bluetooth on per say. It just uses that tech. I believe you will have to enable Nearby places, which is disabled by default but will probably be enabled by default in the future. MJ Nearby places will not be going on... F4LL0U7 I'm not sure they could develop an ad that's targeted enough to get me to buy Coke. F4LL0U7 I guess I might consider it if the vending machine held a family member hostage or something. James F I don't know if I should be concerned that you said *might* consider it.... F4LL0U7 What can I say, I'm just not very receptive to ads. Dedren What about Water, Sprite, SimplyOrange, Powerade, Minute Maid? Surely one of those you drink...all Coke. F4LL0U7 I mean, of course I drink water, but I get it from the filtered pitcher in my fridge. No to the others. xyz You regularly purchase water from the Coca-Cola company? May I also say, I've never heard of SimplyOrange and Powerade. I had no idea that diabetes and obesity came in so many flavors. Adrian quickest way to turn me off on a product. Bluetooth is only on in my car anyway so good luck with it. As soon as someone figures out how to spoof it and annoy people in public, it will go away. Max Johnson I thought it's been NFC and GPS all this time. At least from my Android Pay app. Adrian I don't leave either on when I'm not using them so it's probably a non-issue for me then. blindexecutioner I would literally break my phone if I got an ad as I walked by a pop machine (or whatever) if I couldn't opt out of it of course.. I would switch to iOS that day. If it happened on iOS I would stop using smart phones altogether. tehboogieman You could just turn off bluetooth. Or you know, there's your way rndusrnm479461 iOS also supports this same thing. rndusrnm479461 I've read the whole article and even watched some of that video and I still don't get it - what do your "preferences" affect in the ads? How will it affect what the ad displays? Does it just play the ad you're more likely to prefer from 5 different ads? I'm confused... Why is such system necessary for something simple like coke? Would make more sense for a bus stop ad or other kinds of billboards. Joey1058 I hate to tell you folks this, but I've been out in the wilderness preaching this for at least a good 10 years, if you go by my 2007 blog post: http://joey1058.blogspot.com/2007/07/robots-dreams-is-vending-machine-robot.html Cakefish ALL GLORY TO THE HYPNOTOAD!!! xyz Damn, you got me. I have no choice now but to buy a Pepsi. psuedonymous "On a more technical note, I'm not sure exactly what sort of data is being sent to the displays by nearby phones or how it is taken." BLE Beacons are transmit-only. In order for a piece of ad signage to get any information from you, the chain works like this: BLE beacon emits location. Phone detects beacon, is informed that it is near location. Software on phone then queries backend platform (Google's Beacon platform in this case) to see if there is anything it needs to do with this new knowledge. This could be displaying a popup message, or in this case the phone itself does nothing. Instead, since Google's service has learnt your phone is near a beacon (geographically it cares not, this is logical nearness rather than necessarily physical nearness) so contacts the beacon owner with "Anonuser is nearby who hits your preset filter for Target users" (e.g. users who like coke, users who are above a certain age, users who have not previously pinged this beacon, etc). 'Anonuser' could be a unique but nonpersonal hash, a semi-persistant hash (e.g. for each ad client only), a time-limited persistant hash (e.g. valid for only a certain period before changing, probably just for the single proximity session), or just no hash at all so the ad client cannot track individual users. There may be an avenue for the ad client to pass a message back to google who can then pass it onto the user, without the ad client knowing who the user is.

Digital Trends Home > Virtual Reality > The battle of the entry-level headsets:… The battle of the entry-level headsets: Google’s Daydream View vs. Samsung’s Gear VR By Will Nicol — Updated May 13, 2017 6:01 am Share Samsung Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: For as much as tech writers talk about the VR revolution, virtual reality still remains purely theoretical for most consumers. Headsets such as the HTC Vive and Oculus Rift are expensive, as are the high-end computers required to run them. There are plenty of entry-level VR headsets that run off of smartphones, but many are too weak to deliver a truly engaging experience. Of the smartphone-powered VR headsets on the market, only Google’s Daydream View, a headset designed to be used in conjunction with Daydream VR, and Samsung’s Gear VR, a VR accessory compatible with Samsung’s Galaxy phones, have impressed us so far. But how do the two compare? Here, we take an in-depth look at both to find out. Daydream View Gear VR Optical Lens 90-degree field of view 101-degree field of view Display Depends on device 2560 x 1440 pixel Super AMOLED Refresh Rate Depends on device 60 Hz Required Hardware Google Pixel, Pixel XL, Huawei Mate 9 Pro, ZTE Axon 7, Motorola Moto Z, Asus Zenfone 3 Deluxe Galaxy Note 5, Note 7, Galaxy S6, S6 Edge, S6 Edge+, S7, S7 Edge, S8, S8+ Sensor Accelerator, gyrometer, proximity Accelerator, gyrometer, proximity Focal Adjustment N/A Focus adjustment wheel Interpupillary Distance Coverage ~64 mm 54~70 mm Physical UI Motion controller (included) Touchpad, Back button, volume key, and Gear VR controller (included) Connection Wireless connection USB Type-C and MicroUSB Dimensions 166.8 x 4.18 x 3.88 mm 201.9 x 116.4 x 92.6 mm Weight 220 grams 310 grams Color variants Slate, snow, and crimson Blue black, orchard gray Price $79, plus cost of phone $130, plus cost of phone Availability Available now Available now DT Review 3.5 out of 5 stars 4 out of 5 stars (late-2015 model) Design Google designed the Daydream View to be comfortable, first and foremost. Most VR headsets are very obviously gadgets, made of a lot of plastic and rubber. But that’s not the case here — Google partnered with a clothing brand to achieve the headset’s look and feel. The plastic frame feels a little cheap, but we’re big fans of the Daydream View’s soft-touch fabric. It’s lightweight and cushion-y, and has somewhat of a “comfy sweatpants vibe.” It doesn’t feel fragile, and the the face mask can be removed and washed — a feature we came to appreciate in our review, after watching hours of VR content. The Gear VR, on the other hand, is made of plastic with a matte finish, and it’s lined with a rubber face mask. The newest generation of the device has slightly larger lenses with a separator between them, and an improved smartphone cover that snaps more easily onto the front of the device. Google’s goal with the View is ease of use. As such, the View has no wires to fiddle with. You simply unfasten the elastic strap at the top of the headset to open the front panel, slide your phone between the front panel and lens, close it up, and refasten the strap. You don’t need to press anything to launch Daydream — the NFC chip in your phone will do that for you. With the Gear VR, you need to plug in your phone via the micro-USB or USB Type-C connection. Controls When it comes to controls, the Gear VR and View are fairly comparable. Google’s headset comes with a two-button controller outfitted with motion sensors, a trackpad, and a volume rocker on the side. The large circular dimple at the top acts as a selection button, and the lowest button serves as the Home button. The device resembles a Wii remote, and packs a 220mAh rechargeable battery that lasts anywhere between 30 minutes and an hour. When drained, it charges via USB Type-C. In our review of the Daydream View, we were impressed by its responsiveness — there isn’t a lot of latency. And we liked that it could be paired with up to two phones, which comes in handy if you’re sharing a Daydream View with another person. Samsung’s newest Gear VR headset, on the other hand, comes with the Gear VR Controller, an Oculus-designed motion wand that looks like a miniature HTC Vive controller. It, like the Daydream View controller, has a touch-sensitive trackpad that doubles as a clickable selection button. Below the trackpad are Home, Select, Volume, and Back buttons, and on the underside is a trigger. A wrist strap is also located near the bottom, which helps prevent you from losing your grip. Unlike the Daydream View remote, the Gear VR Controller takes a pair of AA batteries, which Samsung says last up to 40 days. This, however, is entirely dependent on the battery manufacturer and how much you use it. Inside is a gyroscope, accelerometer, and magnometer for tracking motion, allowing you to point, drag, drop, tilt, shoot, and carry out a host of other actions. In our brief time with the Gear VR Controller at Mobile World Congress, it felt sturdy, stable, and easy to grasp. The Home and Volume buttons were responsive, and the trigger felt satisfying and springy. The Gear VR also has a built-in directional pad and Back button, and can be paired with third-party controllers. Most importantly, both headsets have been designed to accommodate users with glasses. Performance The Daydream View’s performance depends heavily on which phone you’re using to power it. According to Google’s official Daydream specifications, any phone with at least a 1080p display between 4.7 and 6 inches in size qualifies. It must support a refresh rate of at least 60 Hz, however, and a “low-persistence” mode. It also must have at least two physical processor cores, one of which must be assigned exclusively to the Daydream app. The list of Daydream-supported smartphones is growing by the day, but here are some of the most popular models: The Moto Z and Moto Z Force, both of which have screen resolutions of 2,560 x 1,440, Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 820 processor, and 4GB of RAM. They start at $624 and $720, respectively. The ZTE Axon 7, which has a screen resolution of 2,560 x 1,440 pixels, a Snapdragon 820 processor, and either 4GB or 6GB of RAM. It starts at $400. The Asus Zenfone 3 Deluxe, which has a screen resolution of 2,560 x 1,440 pixels, a Snapdragon 821 processor, and 6GB of RAM. Pricing has yet to be announced. The Google Pixel and Pixel XL which have screen resolutions of 1080p and 1440p respectively, a Snapdragon 821 processor, and 4GB of RAM. The Pixel starts at $650 and the XL at $770. The Gear VR, on the other hand, requires a Samsung Galaxy phone such as the Galaxy S8, S7, or the S7 Edge. These have 1440p displays. Daydream-compatible smartphones and Samsung’s Galaxy phones may pack different components, but Samsung and Google have done their best to establish baseline specs — even on “low-end” hardware, you’ll have a pretty good VR experience using both Daydream and the Gear VR. For now, it doesn’t seem like either headset will make for a remarkably different VR experience. Software Google’s approach to software on the Daydream View is commendable. It’s simple, intuitive, and beginner-friendly — there’s even an interactive guide that teaches you how to use the remote, and a tutorial that has you exploring the woods with a flashlight. The Daydream home screen resembles the layout of apps on the Oculus Rift. You can view your most recently-used apps, along with a library of all installed Daydream apps. Apps also download from Google Play, which means you don’t have to take off the headset to download an app or game. But you can browse the Daydream app when you’re not in VR mode, too, and quickly launch apps that way. In our review of the Gear VR, we noted that the software interface had “a blocky, flat design,” but that navigating it was fairly easy. It doesn’t offer the same cute, intuitive onboarding experience as the Daydream View, but it’s fairly self-explanatory. On the left and right sides are the Library and Oculus Store, where you can download various apps and games. You scroll through pages using the Gear VR’s built-in trackpad, or the Gear VR Controller. The Gear VR boasts hundreds of VR experiences and games. Some of the highlights include Facebook 360, a hub for the social network’s 360-degree video and picture content, and Minecraft, Microsoft’s Lego-like creation platform. Other standouts include Hitman Go: VR Edition, an adaptation of the smartphone-centric Hitman Go, and Paint VR, a blank VR canvas on which you can doodle. Earlier this year, Oculus also announced that more than 70 in-development titles would soon take advantage of the Gear VR Controller. Google’s Daydream platform may not be able to match the Gear VR when it comes to volume, but that doesn’t mean it’s without compelling content of its own. A few highlights include Google’s suite of VR-optimized apps — YouTube VR, Street View, Google Play Movies, etc. — as well as experiences such as Wonderglade, Mekorama VR, Hunters Gate, and Star Chart VR. You can also use the headset to access coverage from The Wall Street Journal VR, CNN VR, The Guardian VR, and The New York Times, along with video apps such as HBO Go, Netflix, and Hulu VR. Recent titles like Gunjack 2: End of Shift and Danger Goat are just an added plus. Pricing and availability Both of these headsets are affordable gateways into VR. Either iteration of the Gear VR will run you a cool $130, and comes bundled with the aforementioned Gear VR Controller. The Daydream View currently retails for $79, and is available in snow, slate, or crimson configurations. Conclusion Last year, Oculus had a virtual monopoly on entry-level VR. The Daydream View is the Gear VR’s first major competitor, and it’s a neck-and-neck race. We’re big fans of the Daydream View’s softer, more comfortable headset and easy-to-use software. But Samsung’s new Gear VR Controller shakes things up. It offers more inputs and longer battery life than the Daydream View’s controller, and supports exclusive games and experiences. Our review of the Gear VR Controller is forthcoming, so we’ll have to call it a tie for now. But in the meantime, it’s tough to go wrong with either platform.

Netflix confirms it is blocking rooted/unlocked devices, app itself is still working (for now) Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/05/13 3:08pm PDTMay 13, 2017 127 Plus 1 on G+ 452 Share on Facebook 161 Share on Twitter Total Shares740 Applications News Earlier today, Netflix started showing up as 'incompatible' on the Play Store for rooted and unlocked Android devices. However, the app itself continued to work fine, leading some (including myself) to think it could have been an accident. However, Netflix has now confirmed to us that blocking modified devices from downloading the app was intentional. This is the full statement: With our latest 5.0 release, we now fully rely on the Widevine DRM provided by Google; therefore, many devices that are not Google-certified or have been altered will no longer work with our latest app and those users will no longer see the Netflix app in the Play Store. If you're not familiar with it, Widevine is a Google-made DRM technology that works across various desktop and mobile platforms. Widevine categorizes devices into three security levels, ranging from all processes running in the Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) to not running anything in TEE at all. However, the Play Store listing seems tied to a device's SaftetyNet status (which is used by Android Pay), rather than the Widevine TEE. For example, Artem's bootloader-unlocked stock Pixel is still on Widevine Level 1, the most secure level, but fails SafetyNet because it is unlocked. The update's changelog also confirms the: "Version 5.0 only works with devices that are certified by Google and meet all Android requirements." What isn't exactly clear is why only the Play store listing is blocked, but the app itself continued to function normally. I tried both Netflix 4.16 and 5.0.4 (the latest version, from today), and both worked without problems on my unlocked and rooted Galaxy Tab S (which is labeled as Widevine Security Level 3). Maybe at some point the app will stop working, but that does not appear to be the case right now. If you have a blocked device, I recommend following the Pushbullet channel for Netflix on APKMirror (click the Pushbullet button on that page) so you can continue to receive updates outside the Play Store.

But Netflix have to negotiate licencing deals with the movie studios, and having DRM helps reassure the studios that the movies they have spent millions of dollars making aren't going to get stolen off Netflix without any attempt to stop it. mjh49783ab One could make the argument that rooting the phone may compromise the DRM. But blocking users from unlocking their phones to switch carriers? That is total bullshit, and is just the sort of thing that encourages users to pirate the content. Jimk4003 Netflix are blocking you from switching carriers? lomsha Sim unlocked phones are fine, unlocked bootloaders are blocked. h4rr4r The studios need to reconsider blu rays then. Way easier to rip. Nothing they do will stop piracy. This kind of thing actually encourages it. Jimk4003 Maybe studios do need to consider Blu-ray's. That isn't Netflix's problem though. h4rr4r No Netflix problem is making sure they don't let the studios reduce the value of their product. If Amazon video works on my devices and Netflix does not that is a big deal to me. In that case I might as well sign up for more addon channels on Amazon with the mkney that currently goes to Netflix. Jimk4003 Agreed. But the studios are responsible for making the product they redistribute. It's certainly a balancing act, and I can see both sides of the argument, but Netflix isn't an inalienable right, and those who don't meet the T&C's are going to miss out. h4rr4r Sure, but the studios and Netflix are going to create pirates with these kind of actions. People aren't going to miss out. They will just pirate what they can't get legally. Doby Gillis whaa fucking whaa. Sergio Carmona The only obvious thing here is your sarcasm detector not working properly. Go have it fixed please. Jimk4003 Nah, I'm good. h4rr4r So the reason are to make the product worse for the consumer. Great idea, now piracy looks better and better. Jimk4003 What percentage of phones are rooted though? Most people won't care, or even notice the change. h4rr4r It does not matter, if it drives even one person to piracy that is a loss. Jimk4003 But if they can ensure better licensing deals via these new terms, which will attract more customers at the expense of a few rooted users who make up a tiny fraction of overall users; will Netflix care about that loss? h4rr4r But if it encourages piracy the other side of the contract should want to avoid it. Gaining customers in the short term like this hurts the whole market in the long term. Cyber_Akuma Because yeah, people are going to rip movies from Netflix and not off a Blu-Ray.... and even IF they were to attempt to rip them off Netflix, they would use a PHONE and not a PC.... Lord Argyris Looks like I'll have to start updating manually then. Or just not bother with the app at all since I rarely use Netflix on my phone as it is. SpasilliumNexus Thank goodness the 3T's Open Beta of OxygenOS is good enough for me to not unlock my device and stick with complete stock. Now I wonder why I haven't received any Netflix app updates beyond 4.16.1 build 15145 on the Play Store, when APKMirror has 4 newer versions. Φώτης Because unlocking your Android powered device is such a "bad" thing to do. Whatever Netflix. Ailín Ó’S Ναι, ακριβώς... 😑 C64 How about some English Rob Google translate says that "Ναι, ακριβώς" translates to "Yes, exactly". pcriz How about some Google translate :-/ asianrage Is it being Unlocked that is not allowed, or Unlocked and Rooted as well? Corbin Davenport Both. Artem can't install it on his unlocked Google Pixel XL. h4rr4r Huh? He can install it, just not from the play store. Apk mirror, soon back answer. Corbin Davenport Yes, that's what I meant. It doesn't appear on the Play Store for him. asianrage That's so shitty. lomsha Idiotic. Andreaeritzman Google is paying 97$ per hour! Work for few hours & have longer with friends and family! !sf93c: On tuesday I got a great new Land Rover Range Rover from having earned $8752 this last four weeks.. Its the most-financialy rewarding I've had.. Follow this link for more information !sf93c: ➽➽ ➽➽;➽➽ http://GoogleFinancialCashJobs383TopNovaGetPaid$97/Hour... ★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫::::::!sf93c:....,..... _jack_ I will send them feedback about this. nagi Just another step that makes pirating the same content more convenient... we should really be going the other way if they ever want piracy to be reduced. lomsha Funny thing is their content is available to stream all over the internet. Don't see how this move fights piracy as long as computers have access. This just alienates legit users who are doing nothing nefarious on unlocked/rooted devices. Richard Branches By one everybody pays... Pathum Addarapathirana Dude I root my phone to just get iPhone emojis and to tether without my carrier knowing. Like I'm not stealing anything this will just make me stop paying for Netflix. Latheryin Just a heads up. Those treating hiding mods are fake. There is no way to hide if from the carrier. Heck if they wanted to they could see every web page you load from a ton of different places and ways. Yan Minari That’s why god invented VPN Latheryin Yes but even then it doesn't block everything. qqqqqq My provider absolutely blocks tethering - I've been using various methods, including VPNs, to block it for literally YEARS... Hasn't been difficult. Dylan Harris That's not true. All you have to due to bypass tethering limits on t-mobile is to change the TTL on the tethered device. Latheryin That just gets by the automated checks. Get a live person to randomly pick your account (not really likely but happens) and it is not had to tell if someone is tethering. Android Developer Is the tether solution needed even if you do it using USB ? Fulbring What a stupid move. I pay for the premium for Netflix and I never thought that I might have to cancel my service just because they did this. The only reason why I have root is because of AdAway and TitaniumBackup. I still use the stock OnePlus 3T ROM. Wasn't expecting this at all.... Kinda suck. Will be interesting to see how many customers they lose. Julian Berger Not enough to change it back... 4Ui812 DRM has no place in our lives. I suspect Netflix will have a change of heart within 6 months. Branko Xiaomi phones say bye bye to Netflix. Google go fuck yourselves. Steve_Jobroni Go fucking buy a windows phone. 天地人 Seriously though Windows phones are great. The only problem with them is the lack of applications. Otherwise, it runs great on low-end hardware, has a great UI, the homescreen is innovative, synchronisation with Windows PCs is cool, etc. Jimk4003 This is Netflix, not Google. Cyber_Akuma Google invented this SafetyNet crap, let anyone use it for any reason (Hell, Pokemon GO of all things started using it), and over the last year have been making it even more and more strict and unforgiving. So no, a HUGE part of the blame does lie on Google for being openly hostile towards rooted users and not giving a damn about them. blindexecutioner So the solution is to install from outside the play store. That's great for security. Way to go. Richard Markert No they don't. Since Windows 7, new and default users are not Admin accounts. koiulpoi Sorry, this is absolutely wrong. The first user created on a Windows PC has full administrative access, limited by UAC. You can still delete System32, it's just mildly harder than it used to be. If "new and default users" were not Admin accounts, they couldn't install software, so... TechGuy22 Haha kodi Doesn't matter to me I Stopped paying for Netflix long time ago. C64 Haha Teranium TV 😎 TechGuy22 I like that too. You can even get the mod one and remove the ads. Lol C64 I know, i always use those. I want to pay for the dev, but there's no option to do that. Koko time is coming with a big update to tim242 Thief. Renato Santos This is stupid. Congratulations, Netflix. Jan-Lk Else It is also getting more and more necessary to unlock / root devices due to missing updates etc. But I'm not a Netflix customer and won't become one. C64 Whahaha, this has to be the most retarded move of the year in any category (even Trump can't top this). I'm glad i don't use Old Crap Flix. A Person Hillary, then Netflix. C64 Nope sorry. Since Trump is your president i can't take America serious anymore A Person Timeout, you're not even a US citizen? No interest in your opinion. Roy Riddex Just so I'm clear on this, by unlocked are we talking about SIM unlocked? lomsha No no, unlocked bootloader. Roy Riddex Thanks Corbin Davenport Unlocked bootloader. pbergonzi I wonder how long they'll stick with that premise seeing as how much public opinion expressed here is against them. Screw them. Get the APK somewhere else or install magisk and hide your root. Too many people root their devices and have a good reason for doing so and Netflix should not penalize them. Doby Gillis Dude, normal people don't give a fuck about rooted phones. It's just the elitist twats who do it anymore. twiz0r Dude, you're an elitist twat. Richard Markert Most people who root seem to be. The sentiment among rooters is "if you don't root your phone, you're not as good as me and don't deserve to have a phone. Root you stupid noob!" twiz0r thanks for confirming your twatness. good day. C64 One word ..... Bullshit Corey Kinard I've yet to see that... Maybe you just feel like that because they do in fact know more than you? Jimk4003 I'm sure Netflix are terrified that the tiny fraction of Android users who come to this site, and the similarly tiny fraction who root their phones, are bothered. The rest of the world won't care. C64 Probably 90 % of the people don't know what root is. Almost every person I know owns an Android device, but i'm the only geek who flashes and roots his devices pbergonzi Judging from the posts here it looks like nobody who roots their phone uses Netflix anyway so I guess it's moot. But the outcry sure did get them a bunch of free publicity. T4rd This is what Magisk is for. Pretty sure if I can still use Android Pay with my rooted 6P, I can still use/update Netflix through the Play Store. Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ Magisk still requires that you unlock your bootloader, which is enough to trigger safety net these days, so that won't work. TechGuy22 You don't know how magisk works do you Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ I understand that Magisk is a great tool for modifying my system without actually modifying it. I understand that there are many modules that allow you to do things like hide root, bypass security modules, skin your system, and plenty of other things. What I don't understand is how you can install magisk without unlocking your bootloader. Back when I originally tried it out with pokemon go, it worked well for a while, but eventually even just having my bootloader unlocked was all it took to throw SafetyNet. If that's not an issue anymore, then great! But maybe say that instead of being snarky. Thomas Gladdines Bootloader can be simply locked after rooting and installing a custom recovery. Edwin O. Lol no You could, but then you can't flash anything with said recovery... So no point Muzzy996 Well as an example for the Google Pixel: https://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=71901761&postcount=454 In this case all it takes is a kernel that supports Magisk and hides the fact that the bootloader is unlocked, at which point with Magisk Hide enabled all root and SafetyNet checks pass. Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ Excellent. I'll have to look back into this then, last time I used magisk it wasn't as capable, glad to see it's come this far. sbeaulieu Magical Hide is there for that Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ Can Magical Hide hide that my bootloader is unlocked? Serious question, not being sarcastic or snarky as I was below. sbeaulieu It does make the SafetyNet check pass T4rd Except it's working for me right now... jonzey231 This has been happening for a week now. I tweeted it to Ruddock a few days ago. Just didn't put together that it was because I was unlocked. https://twitter.com/jonzey231/status/862122438125072384 steelew Google really needs to start stealing from the root community the way apple takes from the jailbreak community. It feels like rooting is way down except for a few (legal) use cases. If it weren't for visual tweaks & usability tweaks, I would have no need to root (personally). This kind of stuff starts to make rooting unpleasant. I already can't use fingerprint auth in my banking app any more because root. Jesús Cuenca They do. I used rooms for like 8 years maybe? And a lot of the "new features" always come of the rom or root comunity. Right now i use roms, but not root. Marcelove I'm trying to stay indoors, but is complicate... Greenify for example, works at no root devices nowadays... But is way better with root and Xposed... Doze can't compare against Greenify... Maybe at version number 20 root wouldn't be necessary... Sandeep Raghuraman What about the version downloaded from Amazon app store though? Does that work fine? TwoBit Gary It worked, but it is old version without show downloads. Go to apkmirror oculairmedia Interesting move. I flashed a custom ROM on my Nexus 6 because stock was so slow that it was getting unusable, but screw me right ? Atoqir In my country lots of stuff doesn't work on unrooted devices. My bank app, payment app and local cable TV and digicorder app all stopped working. Also s-health doesn't work anymore and soon Netflix. Time to unroot Marcelove "Time to unroot" Sheep. Richard Markert Rooting is insecure. You don't need to access the system partition except to break things. Benjamin Walburn If that were the case then this wouldn't be an issue. Nobody is looking to break their phone. Richard Markert Few people I've talked to online know what they're doing when it comes to root. Most of those end up breaking things. Rooting is far too easy and probably shouldn't exist at all. Benjamin Walburn You could say the same about anything, not just modification of phones. Maybe you shouldn't own a car if you can't fix it yourself, or have kids if you aren't a doctor. Rooting isn't easy, it's made easy by the hard work of other people. It's not up to you what other people do with their property, you have no right to say that they shouldn't. And if someone breaks their phone, what does it have to do with you? It's their hobby and their phone. You're not their daddy. senoredusty Or use Magisk DJMix No need. You could use magisk su hide for the moment. it still passes the safetynet. I too use a banking app that cannot be used on normal root proocess faceless128 "please stop giving us money and use Kodi instead" Sounds like a great business plan! JD For the sake of Kodi's developers don't say Kodi in that context. ericshmerick Hrmm, every time I hear Kodi, I think of pirated content. Guess when people are like "I use Kodi for my 30TB media collection" I stop and wonder how... Yes, ripping a lifetime of DVDs, but nah. Probably piracy. C64 I know a few how really use it legally Powsniffer0110 Yea I use it legally 95% of the time. Mike Honestly though, if pirate add-ons wern't available on kodi, 98% of the people using it now would not have even heard of it before. Even bad publicity is good publicity. They are not going to publicly come out and say it, but the add-on's are the only reason they're well known. cbstryker Kodi is just an open source media player. To watch any pirated content you either need to download it or install an unaffiliated plugin that streams from pirated sources. C64 Next kodi wil have drm build in. So people have to use forks. I stopped using kodi since i found Teranium TV. cbstryker That makes zero sense. Kodi's reason for existing would stop. Justin D Same...but with Plex and something else >.> Dmitry Stepanushkin Xposed + RootCloak or something similar will do it for most of apps for those who need root. So I think not a big problem. Abhishek Saral Not a big problem but a big annoyance. tehboogieman Hmm, rootcloak isn't working for me with netflix m477 No, it won't work. Safetynet always fails if you have closed activated, or if you just have an unlocked bootloader. Sometimes even by just having adb debugging turned on. Kan☆n MagiskSU and its manager app comes with a very good hider built-in. No Xposed needed. h4rr4r Beyond pointless. Netflix won by being easier than piracy, this threatens to turn back the clock on that. Marcelove Funny thing: I was about to become a subscriber of Netflix after seeing House of Cards by PirateBay but now through the official channel because I thought that Netflix deserved my money... Look : deservED... But this movie will keep me at PirateBay... Funny thing 2: I have a Moto G5 that I could unlock and root and I didn't it just because I wanna see how things are nowadays without root... And I use a lot of apps that would work better with root (Greenify for example)... So I would be able to use Netflix... And I won't and will stay that way only because this douchebag move... Congratulations Netflix... Funny thing 3: So happy that I waited till House of Cards release to become a subscriber... Netflix should learn something from Frank Underwood... And from Blockbuster... tim242 Yeah, sure you were. Once a thief, always a thief. koiulpoi This is the most untrue statement I've read on this website. Thomas Elephants can fly 天地人 http://gadling.com/2012/06/10/airline-transports-herd-of-african-elephants-photos/ 天地人 Yes, because illegally pirating from huge corperations which constantly attempt to and successfully brainwash people into agenda using various tricks, is somehow bad? You're not supporting the creators of the show, sure. But you're also not supporting the 6 Jewish companies that control 90% of American media. Anyways, with your little money you wouldn't be benefitting anybody. Do you honestly think those Jewish companies are dying to get a hold of your $120 you payed for Netflix this year? Probably not. The creators of the show, are well off anyways. Don't companies pay them to have their content on their platform and pay for their production cost and wages? Then; they've already been payed. I'm not endorsing piracy. It isn't the best thing to do, but I think calling people a "thief" and grouping them with people who have actually stolen things off individuals which mean a lot to the individual and murdered some individuals in the process, is just stupid. It's not the same as 'stealing' bits of 1s and 0s. Again, I'm not endorsing piracy, however there are a lot of good reasons to pirate movies and TV shows. Trysta Noticed this a little while ago. The crazy thing is I'm not even rooted or interested in any mods. I needed to sideload the latest version 7.1.2 because my RMA Nexus 6p refused to update on its own. I'm keeping the bootloader unlocked so I can recover if my phone boot loops. I rarely use Netflix on my phone but this is kind of annoying. I suspect this has something to do with offline movie watching (which is amazing). jj14x You don't need to unlock bootloader to sideload the full OTA images that Google publishes on their website. Tim Harman But you do need it to recover in your phone bootloops, as he said. ilovetesla Dumbest blocking I've ever heard Bruce Wayne I stopped rooting ages ago. Android has gotten so good that I don't need it anymore. Muzzy996 Good for you! Not everyone feels the same though, I know I sure don't. Tasker, Adaway, Greenify, Titanium, Substratum and GMD Gesture Controls are all more important to me than Netflix. The day Netflix stops working on my rooted devices (which are what I watch it on, not my TV) is the day I'll cancel my service. No big loss compared to losing root. Richard Markert Tasker is interesting but never felt the need for it. Adaway, titanium are both irrelevant on my S7, I despise gestures beyond simple swiping in the Cardinal directions, and if stock Android is so perfect why do you need to theme it? C64 I have a s7 edge and the stockrom is full of bloatware from Microsoft, Sansung and Google. More than 20 useless apps are included. So yes the s7 needed root. tim242 Wrong. Package Disabler, no root required. Muzzy996 Never said android is perfect, if it was there wouldn't be any competition in the market or users such as myself who feel the need to customize Android. Root is not something I push onto others, its just something that I want on my devices and I make choices about what services I use or devices I purchase based upon my ability to do it. kostas110 maybe if you use some 500+ euro smartphone from 2016-2017 something that not everyone can do C64 I disagree, Android is one big advertising if you don't use root. Apps have ads (not every app has a pro version), internet browsing sucks without Adaway (build in ad blockers in browsers aren't great), YouTube really sucks if it isn't modded (watch a 30 second ad for a 3 minute movie). And devices are full of bloatware that can't be removed without root. Even the Google stuff are bloatware (kiosk, movies,music,books etc). I also like to remove alot of system apps and replace them with my own apps that i prefer (file manager, agenda, email, music/ video player) and i really hate duplicate apps on my devices. Also Titanium Backup is important to me. So Android​ without root isn't Android for me. jetscreamer01 I use adguard to block stupid ads in my apps. Now using any commercial apps is enjoyable. Cyber_Akuma I hate this response. If anything, I have found far more reasons to root than ever before. Being able to create a backup image and install security/tracking software tat can't just be wiped/uninstalled easily is a big one for example. DJMix I really couldn't understand these kind of stupid moves. I mean I kinda get for an Android Pay or some banking apps to implement these limitations. But seriously, a frickin' streaming app? Afraid they're gonna get pirated? For someone who's going to pirate, they probably could just probably reverse engineer the apk and remove the limitations or basically use older apps. Do they really have some idle engineers that they're forced to implement useless feature? ddevito Guess I'll just pirate it all soon. Their loss. JD Fuck Android If OEMs would fucking provide updates for 5 years I wouldn't need to unlock my bootloader. I'm out. I'll come back when Google fixes this shit. Also fuck Netflix. Back to pirating it is. Christopher Bement My app stopped working on my N7 when I sideloaded 5.0. Got an error when trying to play anything. I went and dropped it back to stock on the latest patch and relocked the bootloader. All working fine now. Too fucking bad, Nougat is fantastic on that device, leaps and bounds better than Marshmallow. tehboogieman Which ROM and which N7 do you have? I still have the stock ROM on my 2013 N7 LTE and have been procrastinating loading an N ROM on it Christopher Bement 2013 LTE version and I was using Nitrogen OS (fantastic and stable ROM). I am now on the latest Marshmallow just so that Netflix will work. tehboogieman As long as I can side load it and sign in I'm still ok. It's a pain, but I'd live with that. But if NF blocks root users from signing in, I'm definitely cancelling and just use one of the very easy pirate apps. Wayne Randall I just signed up for Netflix so I could cancel it. I'm part of the group. tim242 You paid them... Richard Markert Hahahahahaha I don't even use Netflix on my phone (screen is too small) so I don't care. But man, the tears and butthurt from the root community is hilarious. Benjamin Walburn You're a very petty child. Richard Markert When something makes me laugh, I point it out. I do that even have a dog in this hunt. I only watch Netflix on my 75" LED TV. I'm just tired of root users smugness. Almost as smug as apple users. Benjamin Walburn You're tired of people being smug in their hobbies, so you gloat about the problems inflicted on them pointlessly? Petty and a hypocrite. Richard Markert What else am I supposed to do to remove the smugness? My name is…. Get a life maybe? Benjamin Walburn Why should you? Is another person's happiness really that painful for you? You already know that they accomplished nothing more than "successfully followed instructions." It seems like your purpose would be better served by targeting that, not just being a jerk. Humbling them is one thing, being an ass is another entirely. tim242 You sound like the petty child. Stomp your foot, becauseyou don't get your way. Benjamin Walburn Not only am I not doing that, I'm not not getting my way, and "stomping​ my foot" is not an example of pettiness. Your wrongness-density is impressive. My name is…. Who beat you as a child? Richard Markert Lol koiulpoi You're on androidpolice.com... making fun of the root community... and unable to see past the end of your nose... Don't you have anything better to do? lomsha Tard me me A primary reason to root is to run adblock because Google is way too greedy. So the irony, Google's greed means there's less reason to pay for NetFlix. Let me guess... shall we? Google Play Movies still works right...? Oh yes, so long as Google makes their money.... tim242 I block ads with Adguard. No root required. Mike | Homeless On Wheels People still use Netflix? Bit Torrent is your friend. dizel123 Exactly. Everyone should stop using Netflix. Not sure how I'm gonna get the shows i currently watch on Netflix from bit torrent since they won't be made anymore once Netflix is shut down, but at least I'll have my bit torrent friend tim242 Some people like to do things properly. derp_cookies So I agree this is a dumb move but everyone is overreacting by threatening to pirate content. This is a niche problem as less people root now, especially since Android pay won't work when you do it. So Netflix isn't any less accessible than it was before. I watch 99% of Netflix at home on my Roku. Luxferro It's not just rooting. My Nexus 6P is running stock google rom, no root, w/ just unlocked bootloader, and netflix is gone in my play store. Not that I watch TV on my phone... but my shield tv is also unlocked... so it's probably just a matter of time. Roh_Mish Dammit Netflix, you make me want to go popcorn time route. My current primary phone and my iPad are what I use to watch netflix and both of them is stock so i don't have anything to worry about but this just feels wrong. Between this and Amazon not releasing the TV app for my sony TV, which they support outside, popcorn time (and in extension piracy) just seems easier. Vivek Rameses This is why we have piracy. Miguel Angel But ...why? occono Distributors want Netflix to stop any possibility of making DRM-Free backups on the content. Mariano Moreira Even more strange is while Netflix app is removed from Playstore, Netflix VR is still.in Playstore. Manually flashing Factory Image for Google Pixel is how I get me OS updates and I choose to leave bootloader unlocked, rather than relocking every month.(which would include full wipe) So I guess they don't care about security for the few users whom might use Netflix VR with Daydream compatible device? tehboogieman I'm not familiar with the Pixel, but almost every Nexus device lets you lock without wiping all your data. Maybe that requires root though, I really don't understand the details on how it works, but hopefully you can find a way to do it. Mariano Moreira To clarify: In order for me to install Factory Image every month, I need to have Bootloader unlocked. Doing the Factory unlock will wipe the device. Locking the device doesn't wipe the device, but Factory unlocking the bootloader will wipe the device. tehboogieman Yeah, sorry I wasn't more specific. I use an app called BootUnlocker. It lets you lock and unlock the bootloader without wiping at will. Since an app can do this, I'm assuming that it can be done via ADB. Also it might only work on older devices, but maybe there's a way to replicate this action on newer devices as well Mariano Moreira I don't understand why Google is promoting Security by having the device fully-locked, yet still relies on ADB fastboot unlock/OEM Unlock commands to flash factory images? saf1927 Why are using factory images when Google provides OTA images too, and these don't require an unlocked bootloader, nor a wipe? jdrch It's not just Netflix. The HDHomeRun Prime app doesn't work on rooted 7.0+ devices either. Jsilvermist Good to know, will no longer recommend Netflix to anyone when I'm asked... D13H4RD2L1V3 This is stupid. I had to root my phone to be able to hide the navbar at any time I want and also to gain better battery management controls and other stuff that I sorely wished Google had added to stock Android way sooner. And I was considering a Netflix subscription. No longer...... Sruly J I know it's not fully a solution which is "worth it", but the app Custom Navigation Bar offers the ability to hide status bar/narbar without root. Although like you said, you had other reasons to root, so... Diar I pay for Netflix so I can watch the content any way I want guilt free, whether that's their app or other locations on the Internet. F their VPN blocking and DRM. If they make their app impossible to use, I just won't use it. They'll still get my money but they will lose any data/tracking since I'll still be watching their shows, just outside of their ecosystem. Dummies. ReedSolomon Between the SJW nonsense like Bill Nye, the ipv6 tunnel blocking (rather than simply defaulting to ipv4), increases in price, less and less quality content, and now this, I see little reason to keep paying for Netflix. robogo I understand Netflix' reasons, I really do - they need to protect their property and investment. But I can't really say I understand the way they're doing this. This is a good way to alienate the small percentage of power users who root their devices for various, but perfectly valid and understandable reasons. And no, this will not make me cancel my membership as long as the app works. Cancelling membership is a silly, overblown reaction to what is, in my mind, a minor nuisance. D13H4RD2L1V3 I personally just find it a dumb move. Seems like an easy way out. Manbearpig I member when netflix released there app for Android and they did the same thing. I would just download the app and be good to go. After awhile though I stop rooting I miss it sometimes Cyber_Akuma I warned people when Pokemon GO of all things had a surprise update that silently added SafetyNet that this garbage was going to become more and more common. Mario RUN uses it too, and now Netflix.... soon apps everywhere are going to add SafetyNet and block rooted devices as standard practice. Google has been incredibly hostile towards people who actually want to own or have control over their devices or even their PC Software over the last few years. And over the last year google has been making SafetyNet more and more harsh, now even tripping if your BOOTLOADER is unlocked even if your phone is not rooted. Pokemon GO and Mario RUN were a small crowd, but I hope after Netflix of all things starts using it (and make no mistake, this is just the beginning) that people will finally push back against Google's hostility towards rooted users. BillPosters I rooted my Android phone to get rid of the annoying camera shutter sound, and to prevent apps from stealing my contacts, and to basically take control of my device rather than letting Google run the whole show, and because of that I can't update Netflix? Good riddance Netflix. Railwayman There is a better solution: Declare the device a DRM free zone and use everything else. DRM to me is "Don't Restrict Me!" and an excellent reason to give certain companies the middle finger telling them to just go and F themselves. The most ironic thing here is that removing Netflix or using DRM otherwise doesn't stop piracy. On the contrary - By buying and using DRM content you get to travel in the cargo hold with no heating while the pirating consumer get first class service: more content, no restrictions, no copyright trailers or ads before the movie start and stop on. Even better: They can use whatever apps or ROMs they want. Would I unroot my device in order to get DRM content onboard? No way!!! If Netflix are so scared - block the client on Mac OS X and Windows et al. Piracy doesn't usually happen with an Android device as a source but rather computers and HDCP rippers. Another thing also to the DRM companies: Everything that can be played back can be recorded! (Good old piracy saying) Netflix out, Fusion with Exodus, SALTS and Phoenix in. Kodi with Rapier skin is much nicer than the Netflix client and Trakt integration make this way a much better one than going down the DRM route, sitting with an uprooted stock ROM and Netflix.;) saf1927 Magisk seems to do the trick. Helios What about my non-rooted OnePlus One? It's also listed as incompatible.. '-_- 天地人 Don't OnePlus devices run a custom ROM and have unlocked bootloaders? Android Developer How can they block people who root the device from installing the app? The play store doesn't have this filter. Maybe after the install they do this check?

Netflix confirms it is blocking rooted/unlocked devices, app itself is still working (for now) Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/05/13 3:08pm PDTMay 13, 2017 127 Plus 1 on G+ 452 Share on Facebook 161 Share on Twitter Total Shares740 Applications News Earlier today, Netflix started showing up as 'incompatible' on the Play Store for rooted and unlocked Android devices. However, the app itself continued to work fine, leading some (including myself) to think it could have been an accident. However, Netflix has now confirmed to us that blocking modified devices from downloading the app was intentional. This is the full statement: With our latest 5.0 release, we now fully rely on the Widevine DRM provided by Google; therefore, many devices that are not Google-certified or have been altered will no longer work with our latest app and those users will no longer see the Netflix app in the Play Store. If you're not familiar with it, Widevine is a Google-made DRM technology that works across various desktop and mobile platforms. Widevine categorizes devices into three security levels, ranging from all processes running in the Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) to not running anything in TEE at all. However, the Play Store listing seems tied to a device's SaftetyNet status (which is used by Android Pay), rather than the Widevine TEE. For example, Artem's bootloader-unlocked stock Pixel is still on Widevine Level 1, the most secure level, but fails SafetyNet because it is unlocked. The update's changelog also confirms the: "Version 5.0 only works with devices that are certified by Google and meet all Android requirements." What isn't exactly clear is why only the Play store listing is blocked, but the app itself continued to function normally. I tried both Netflix 4.16 and 5.0.4 (the latest version, from today), and both worked without problems on my unlocked and rooted Galaxy Tab S (which is labeled as Widevine Security Level 3). Maybe at some point the app will stop working, but that does not appear to be the case right now. If you have a blocked device, I recommend following the Pushbullet channel for Netflix on APKMirror (click the Pushbullet button on that page) so you can continue to receive updates outside the Play Store.

First the vpn's now this... why oh why??? Jimk4003 Surely because licensing is regionally specific, and because rooting has the potential to defeat DRM. I get that it might be annoying for some people, but aren't the reasons obvious? David Juarez But root?? Lol Semianonymous Probably an effort to reduce Region spoofing? Idk how easy that is to do on a stock device. Jimk4003 Because rooting has the potential to defeat DRM. mjh49783ab DRM doesn't work. All DRM does is inconvenience the end user. Jimk4003 Possibly. But Netflix have to negotiate licencing deals with the movie studios, and having DRM helps reassure the studios that the movies they have spent millions of dollars making aren't going to get stolen off Netflix without any attempt to stop it. mjh49783ab One could make the argument that rooting the phone may compromise the DRM. But blocking users from unlocking their phones to switch carriers? That is total bullshit, and is just the sort of thing that encourages users to pirate the content. Jimk4003 Netflix are blocking you from switching carriers? lomsha Sim unlocked phones are fine, unlocked bootloaders are blocked. h4rr4r The studios need to reconsider blu rays then. Way easier to rip. Nothing they do will stop piracy. This kind of thing actually encourages it. Jimk4003 Maybe studios do need to consider Blu-ray's. That isn't Netflix's problem though. h4rr4r No Netflix problem is making sure they don't let the studios reduce the value of their product. If Amazon video works on my devices and Netflix does not that is a big deal to me. In that case I might as well sign up for more addon channels on Amazon with the mkney that currently goes to Netflix. Jimk4003 Agreed. But the studios are responsible for making the product they redistribute. It's certainly a balancing act, and I can see both sides of the argument, but Netflix isn't an inalienable right, and those who don't meet the T&C's are going to miss out. h4rr4r Sure, but the studios and Netflix are going to create pirates with these kind of actions. People aren't going to miss out. They will just pirate what they can't get legally. Doby Gillis whaa fucking whaa. Sergio Carmona The only obvious thing here is your sarcasm detector not working properly. Go have it fixed please. Jimk4003 Nah, I'm good. h4rr4r So the reason are to make the product worse for the consumer. Great idea, now piracy looks better and better. Jimk4003 What percentage of phones are rooted though? Most people won't care, or even notice the change. h4rr4r It does not matter, if it drives even one person to piracy that is a loss. Jimk4003 But if they can ensure better licensing deals via these new terms, which will attract more customers at the expense of a few rooted users who make up a tiny fraction of overall users; will Netflix care about that loss? h4rr4r But if it encourages piracy the other side of the contract should want to avoid it. Gaining customers in the short term like this hurts the whole market in the long term. Cyber_Akuma Because yeah, people are going to rip movies from Netflix and not off a Blu-Ray.... and even IF they were to attempt to rip them off Netflix, they would use a PHONE and not a PC.... Lord Argyris Looks like I'll have to start updating manually then. Or just not bother with the app at all since I rarely use Netflix on my phone as it is. SpasilliumNexus Thank goodness the 3T's Open Beta of OxygenOS is good enough for me to not unlock my device and stick with complete stock. Now I wonder why I haven't received any Netflix app updates beyond 4.16.1 build 15145 on the Play Store, when APKMirror has 4 newer versions. Φώτης Because unlocking your Android powered device is such a "bad" thing to do. Whatever Netflix. Ailín Ó’S Ναι, ακριβώς... 😑 C64 How about some English Rob Google translate says that "Ναι, ακριβώς" translates to "Yes, exactly". pcriz How about some Google translate :-/ asianrage Is it being Unlocked that is not allowed, or Unlocked and Rooted as well? Corbin Davenport Both. Artem can't install it on his unlocked Google Pixel XL. h4rr4r Huh? He can install it, just not from the play store. Apk mirror, soon back answer. Corbin Davenport Yes, that's what I meant. It doesn't appear on the Play Store for him. asianrage That's so shitty. lomsha Idiotic. Andreaeritzman Google is paying 97$ per hour! Work for few hours & have longer with friends and family! !sf93c: On tuesday I got a great new Land Rover Range Rover from having earned $8752 this last four weeks.. Its the most-financialy rewarding I've had..

Don't see how this move fights piracy as long as computers have access. This just alienates legit users who are doing nothing nefarious on unlocked/rooted devices. Richard Branches By one everybody pays... Pathum Addarapathirana Dude I root my phone to just get iPhone emojis and to tether without my carrier knowing. Like I'm not stealing anything this will just make me stop paying for Netflix. Latheryin Just a heads up. Those treating hiding mods are fake. There is no way to hide if from the carrier. Heck if they wanted to they could see every web page you load from a ton of different places and ways. Yan Minari That’s why god invented VPN Latheryin Yes but even then it doesn't block everything. qqqqqq My provider absolutely blocks tethering - I've been using various methods, including VPNs, to block it for literally YEARS... Hasn't been difficult. Dylan Harris That's not true. All you have to due to bypass tethering limits on t-mobile is to change the TTL on the tethered device. Latheryin That just gets by the automated checks. Get a live person to randomly pick your account (not really likely but happens) and it is not had to tell if someone is tethering. Android Developer Is the tether solution needed even if you do it using USB ? Fulbring What a stupid move. I pay for the premium for Netflix and I never thought that I might have to cancel my service just because they did this. The only reason why I have root is because of AdAway and TitaniumBackup. I still use the stock OnePlus 3T ROM. Wasn't expecting this at all.... Kinda suck. Will be interesting to see how many customers they lose. Julian Berger Not enough to change it back... 4Ui812 DRM has no place in our lives. I suspect Netflix will have a change of heart within 6 months. Branko Xiaomi phones say bye bye to Netflix. Google go fuck yourselves. Steve_Jobroni Go fucking buy a windows phone. 天地人 Seriously though Windows phones are great. The only problem with them is the lack of applications. Otherwise, it runs great on low-end hardware, has a great UI, the homescreen is innovative, synchronisation with Windows PCs is cool, etc. Jimk4003 This is Netflix, not Google. Cyber_Akuma Google invented this SafetyNet crap, let anyone use it for any reason (Hell, Pokemon GO of all things started using it), and over the last year have been making it even more and more strict and unforgiving. So no, a HUGE part of the blame does lie on Google for being openly hostile towards rooted users and not giving a damn about them. blindexecutioner So the solution is to install from outside the play store. That's great for security. Way to go. Richard Markert No they don't. Since Windows 7, new and default users are not Admin accounts. koiulpoi Sorry, this is absolutely wrong. The first user created on a Windows PC has full administrative access, limited by UAC. You can still delete System32, it's just mildly harder than it used to be. If "new and default users" were not Admin accounts, they couldn't install software, so... TechGuy22 Haha kodi Doesn't matter to me I Stopped paying for Netflix long time ago. C64 Haha Teranium TV 😎 TechGuy22 I like that too. You can even get the mod one and remove the ads. Lol C64 I know, i always use those. I want to pay for the dev, but there's no option to do that. Koko time is coming with a big update to tim242 Thief. Renato Santos This is stupid. Congratulations, Netflix. Jan-Lk Else It is also getting more and more necessary to unlock / root devices due to missing updates etc. But I'm not a Netflix customer and won't become one. C64 Whahaha, this has to be the most retarded move of the year in any category (even Trump can't top this). I'm glad i don't use Old Crap Flix. A Person Hillary, then Netflix. C64 Nope sorry. Since Trump is your president i can't take America serious anymore A Person Timeout, you're not even a US citizen? No interest in your opinion. Roy Riddex Just so I'm clear on this, by unlocked are we talking about SIM unlocked? lomsha No no, unlocked bootloader. Roy Riddex Thanks Corbin Davenport Unlocked bootloader. pbergonzi I wonder how long they'll stick with that premise seeing as how much public opinion expressed here is against them. Screw them. Get the APK somewhere else or install magisk and hide your root. Too many people root their devices and have a good reason for doing so and Netflix should not penalize them. Doby Gillis Dude, normal people don't give a fuck about rooted phones. It's just the elitist twats who do it anymore. twiz0r Dude, you're an elitist twat. Richard Markert Most people who root seem to be. The sentiment among rooters is "if you don't root your phone, you're not as good as me and don't deserve to have a phone. Root you stupid noob!" twiz0r thanks for confirming your twatness. good day. C64 One word ..... Bullshit Corey Kinard I've yet to see that... Maybe you just feel like that because they do in fact know more than you? Jimk4003 I'm sure Netflix are terrified that the tiny fraction of Android users who come to this site, and the similarly tiny fraction who root their phones, are bothered. The rest of the world won't care. C64 Probably 90 % of the people don't know what root is. Almost every person I know owns an Android device, but i'm the only geek who flashes and roots his devices pbergonzi Judging from the posts here it looks like nobody who roots their phone uses Netflix anyway so I guess it's moot. But the outcry sure did get them a bunch of free publicity. T4rd This is what Magisk is for. Pretty sure if I can still use Android Pay with my rooted 6P, I can still use/update Netflix through the Play Store. Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ Magisk still requires that you unlock your bootloader, which is enough to trigger safety net these days, so that won't work. TechGuy22 You don't know how magisk works do you Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ I understand that Magisk is a great tool for modifying my system without actually modifying it. I understand that there are many modules that allow you to do things like hide root, bypass security modules, skin your system, and plenty of other things. What I don't understand is how you can install magisk without unlocking your bootloader. Back when I originally tried it out with pokemon go, it worked well for a while, but eventually even just having my bootloader unlocked was all it took to throw SafetyNet. If that's not an issue anymore, then great! But maybe say that instead of being snarky. Thomas Gladdines Bootloader can be simply locked after rooting and installing a custom recovery. Edwin O. Lol no You could, but then you can't flash anything with said recovery... So no point Muzzy996 Well as an example for the Google Pixel: https://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=71901761&postcount=454 In this case all it takes is a kernel that supports Magisk and hides the fact that the bootloader is unlocked, at which point with Magisk Hide enabled all root and SafetyNet checks pass. Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ Excellent. I'll have to look back into this then, last time I used magisk it wasn't as capable, glad to see it's come this far. sbeaulieu Magical Hide is there for that Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ Can Magical Hide hide that my bootloader is unlocked? Serious question, not being sarcastic or snarky as I was below. sbeaulieu It does make the SafetyNet check pass T4rd Except it's working for me right now... jonzey231 This has been happening for a week now. I tweeted it to Ruddock a few days ago. Just didn't put together that it was because I was unlocked. https://twitter.com/jonzey231/status/862122438125072384 steelew Google really needs to start stealing from the root community the way apple takes from the jailbreak community. It feels like rooting is way down except for a few (legal) use cases. If it weren't for visual tweaks & usability tweaks, I would have no need to root (personally). This kind of stuff starts to make rooting unpleasant. I already can't use fingerprint auth in my banking app any more because root. Jesús Cuenca They do. I used rooms for like 8 years maybe? And a lot of the "new features" always come of the rom or root comunity. Right now i use roms, but not root. Marcelove I'm trying to stay indoors, but is complicate... Greenify for example, works at no root devices nowadays... But is way better with root and Xposed... Doze can't compare against Greenify... Maybe at version number 20 root wouldn't be necessary... Sandeep Raghuraman What about the version downloaded from Amazon app store though? Does that work fine? TwoBit Gary It worked, but it is old version without show downloads. Go to apkmirror oculairmedia Interesting move. I flashed a custom ROM on my Nexus 6 because stock was so slow that it was getting unusable, but screw me right ? Atoqir In my country lots of stuff doesn't work on unrooted devices. My bank app, payment app and local cable TV and digicorder app all stopped working. Also s-health doesn't work anymore and soon Netflix. Time to unroot Marcelove "Time to unroot" Sheep. Richard Markert Rooting is insecure. You don't need to access the system partition except to break things. Benjamin Walburn If that were the case then this wouldn't be an issue. Nobody is looking to break their phone. Richard Markert Few people I've talked to online know what they're doing when it comes to root. Most of those end up breaking things. Rooting is far too easy and probably shouldn't exist at all. Benjamin Walburn You could say the same about anything, not just modification of phones. Maybe you shouldn't own a car if you can't fix it yourself, or have kids if you aren't a doctor. Rooting isn't easy, it's made easy by the hard work of other people. It's not up to you what other people do with their property, you have no right to say that they shouldn't. And if someone breaks their phone, what does it have to do with you? It's their hobby and their phone. You're not their daddy. senoredusty Or use Magisk DJMix No need. You could use magisk su hide for the moment. it still passes the safetynet. I too use a banking app that cannot be used on normal root proocess faceless128 "please stop giving us money and use Kodi instead" Sounds like a great business plan! JD For the sake of Kodi's developers don't say Kodi in that context. ericshmerick Hrmm, every time I hear Kodi, I think of pirated content. Guess when people are like "I use Kodi for my 30TB media collection" I stop and wonder how... Yes, ripping a lifetime of DVDs, but nah. Probably piracy. C64 I know a few how really use it legally Powsniffer0110 Yea I use it legally 95% of the time. Mike Honestly though, if pirate add-ons wern't available on kodi, 98% of the people using it now would not have even heard of it before. Even bad publicity is good publicity. They are not going to publicly come out and say it, but the add-on's are the only reason they're well known. cbstryker Kodi is just an open source media player. To watch any pirated content you either need to download it or install an unaffiliated plugin that streams from pirated sources. C64 Next kodi wil have drm build in. So people have to use forks. I stopped using kodi since i found Teranium TV. cbstryker That makes zero sense. Kodi's reason for existing would stop. Justin D Same...but with Plex and something else >.> Dmitry Stepanushkin Xposed + RootCloak or something similar will do it for most of apps for those who need root. So I think not a big problem. Abhishek Saral Not a big problem but a big annoyance. tehboogieman Hmm, rootcloak isn't working for me with netflix m477 No, it won't work. Safetynet always fails if you have closed activated, or if you just have an unlocked bootloader. Sometimes even by just having adb debugging turned on. Kan☆n MagiskSU and its manager app comes with a very good hider built-in. No Xposed needed. h4rr4r Beyond pointless. Netflix won by being easier than piracy, this threatens to turn back the clock on that. Marcelove Funny thing: I was about to become a subscriber of Netflix after seeing House of Cards by PirateBay but now through the official channel because I thought that Netflix deserved my money... Look : deservED... But this movie will keep me at PirateBay... Funny thing 2: I have a Moto G5 that I could unlock and root and I didn't it just because I wanna see how things are nowadays without root... And I use a lot of apps that would work better with root (Greenify for example)... So I would be able to use Netflix... And I won't and will stay that way only because this douchebag move... Congratulations Netflix... Funny thing 3: So happy that I waited till House of Cards release to become a subscriber... Netflix should learn something from Frank Underwood... And from Blockbuster... tim242 Yeah, sure you were. Once a thief, always a thief. koiulpoi This is the most untrue statement I've read on this website. Thomas Elephants can fly 天地人 http://gadling.com/2012/06/10/airline-transports-herd-of-african-elephants-photos/ 天地人 Yes, because illegally pirating from huge corperations which constantly attempt to and successfully brainwash people into agenda using various tricks, is somehow bad? You're not supporting the creators of the show, sure. But you're also not supporting the 6 Jewish companies that control 90% of American media. Anyways, with your little money you wouldn't be benefitting anybody. Do you honestly think those Jewish companies are dying to get a hold of your $120 you payed for Netflix this year? Probably not. The creators of the show, are well off anyways. Don't companies pay them to have their content on their platform and pay for their production cost and wages? Then; they've already been payed. I'm not endorsing piracy. It isn't the best thing to do, but I think calling people a "thief" and grouping them with people who have actually stolen things off individuals which mean a lot to the individual and murdered some individuals in the process, is just stupid. It's not the same as 'stealing' bits of 1s and 0s. Again, I'm not endorsing piracy, however there are a lot of good reasons to pirate movies and TV shows. Trysta Noticed this a little while ago. The crazy thing is I'm not even rooted or interested in any mods. I needed to sideload the latest version 7.1.2 because my RMA Nexus 6p refused to update on its own. I'm keeping the bootloader unlocked so I can recover if my phone boot loops. I rarely use Netflix on my phone but this is kind of annoying. I suspect this has something to do with offline movie watching (which is amazing). jj14x You don't need to unlock bootloader to sideload the full OTA images that Google publishes on their website. Tim Harman But you do need it to recover in your phone bootloops, as he said. ilovetesla Dumbest blocking I've ever heard Bruce Wayne I stopped rooting ages ago. Android has gotten so good that I don't need it anymore. Muzzy996 Good for you! Not everyone feels the same though, I know I sure don't. Tasker, Adaway, Greenify, Titanium, Substratum and GMD Gesture Controls are all more important to me than Netflix. The day Netflix stops working on my rooted devices (which are what I watch it on, not my TV) is the day I'll cancel my service. No big loss compared to losing root. Richard Markert Tasker is interesting but never felt the need for it. Adaway, titanium are both irrelevant on my S7, I despise gestures beyond simple swiping in the Cardinal directions, and if stock Android is so perfect why do you need to theme it? C64 I have a s7 edge and the stockrom is full of bloatware from Microsoft, Sansung and Google. More than 20 useless apps are included. So yes the s7 needed root. tim242 Wrong. Package Disabler, no root required. Muzzy996 Never said android is perfect, if it was there wouldn't be any competition in the market or users such as myself who feel the need to customize Android. Root is not something I push onto others, its just something that I want on my devices and I make choices about what services I use or devices I purchase based upon my ability to do it. kostas110 maybe if you use some 500+ euro smartphone from 2016-2017 something that not everyone can do C64 I disagree, Android is one big advertising if you don't use root. Apps have ads (not every app has a pro version), internet browsing sucks without Adaway (build in ad blockers in browsers aren't great), YouTube really sucks if it isn't modded (watch a 30 second ad for a 3 minute movie). And devices are full of bloatware that can't be removed without root. Even the Google stuff are bloatware (kiosk, movies,music,books etc). I also like to remove alot of system apps and replace them with my own apps that i prefer (file manager, agenda, email, music/ video player) and i really hate duplicate apps on my devices. Also Titanium Backup is important to me. So Android​ without root isn't Android for me. jetscreamer01 I use adguard to block stupid ads in my apps. Now using any commercial apps is enjoyable. Cyber_Akuma I hate this response. If anything, I have found far more reasons to root than ever before. Being able to create a backup image and install security/tracking software tat can't just be wiped/uninstalled easily is a big one for example. DJMix I really couldn't understand these kind of stupid moves. I mean I kinda get for an Android Pay or some banking apps to implement these limitations. But seriously, a frickin' streaming app? Afraid they're gonna get pirated? For someone who's going to pirate, they probably could just probably reverse engineer the apk and remove the limitations or basically use older apps. Do they really have some idle engineers that they're forced to implement useless feature? ddevito Guess I'll just pirate it all soon. Their loss. JD Fuck Android If OEMs would fucking provide updates for 5 years I wouldn't need to unlock my bootloader. I'm out. I'll come back when Google fixes this shit. Also fuck Netflix. Back to pirating it is. Christopher Bement My app stopped working on my N7 when I sideloaded 5.0. Got an error when trying to play anything. I went and dropped it back to stock on the latest patch and relocked the bootloader. All working fine now. Too fucking bad, Nougat is fantastic on that device, leaps and bounds better than Marshmallow. tehboogieman Which ROM and which N7 do you have? I still have the stock ROM on my 2013 N7 LTE and have been procrastinating loading an N ROM on it Christopher Bement 2013 LTE version and I was using Nitrogen OS (fantastic and stable ROM). I am now on the latest Marshmallow just so that Netflix will work. tehboogieman As long as I can side load it and sign in I'm still ok. It's a pain, but I'd live with that. But if NF blocks root users from signing in, I'm definitely cancelling and just use one of the very easy pirate apps. Wayne Randall I just signed up for Netflix so I could cancel it. I'm part of the group. tim242 You paid them... Richard Markert Hahahahahaha I don't even use Netflix on my phone (screen is too small) so I don't care. But man, the tears and butthurt from the root community is hilarious. Benjamin Walburn You're a very petty child. Richard Markert When something makes me laugh, I point it out. I do that even have a dog in this hunt. I only watch Netflix on my 75" LED TV. I'm just tired of root users smugness. Almost as smug as apple users. Benjamin Walburn You're tired of people being smug in their hobbies, so you gloat about the problems inflicted on them pointlessly? Petty and a hypocrite. Richard Markert What else am I supposed to do to remove the smugness? My name is…. Get a life maybe? Benjamin Walburn Why should you? Is another person's happiness really that painful for you? You already know that they accomplished nothing more than "successfully followed instructions." It seems like your purpose would be better served by targeting that, not just being a jerk. Humbling them is one thing, being an ass is another entirely. tim242 You sound like the petty child. Stomp your foot, becauseyou don't get your way. Benjamin Walburn Not only am I not doing that, I'm not not getting my way, and "stomping​ my foot" is not an example of pettiness. Your wrongness-density is impressive. My name is…. Who beat you as a child? Richard Markert Lol koiulpoi You're on androidpolice.com... making fun of the root community... and unable to see past the end of your nose... Don't you have anything better to do? lomsha Tard me me A primary reason to root is to run adblock because Google is way too greedy. So the irony, Google's greed means there's less reason to pay for NetFlix. Let me guess... shall we? Google Play Movies still works right...? Oh yes, so long as Google makes their money.... tim242 I block ads with Adguard. No root required. Mike | Homeless On Wheels People still use Netflix? Bit Torrent is your friend. dizel123 Exactly. Everyone should stop using Netflix. Not sure how I'm gonna get the shows i currently watch on Netflix from bit torrent since they won't be made anymore once Netflix is shut down, but at least I'll have my bit torrent friend tim242 Some people like to do things properly. derp_cookies So I agree this is a dumb move but everyone is overreacting by threatening to pirate content. This is a niche problem as less people root now, especially since Android pay won't work when you do it. So Netflix isn't any less accessible than it was before. I watch 99% of Netflix at home on my Roku. Luxferro It's not just rooting. My Nexus 6P is running stock google rom, no root, w/ just unlocked bootloader, and netflix is gone in my play store. Not that I watch TV on my phone... but my shield tv is also unlocked... so it's probably just a matter of time. Roh_Mish Dammit Netflix, you make me want to go popcorn time route. My current primary phone and my iPad are what I use to watch netflix and both of them is stock so i don't have anything to worry about but this just feels wrong. Between this and Amazon not releasing the TV app for my sony TV, which they support outside, popcorn time (and in extension piracy) just seems easier. Vivek Rameses This is why we have piracy. Miguel Angel But ...why? occono Distributors want Netflix to stop any possibility of making DRM-Free backups on the content. Mariano Moreira Even more strange is while Netflix app is removed from Playstore, Netflix VR is still.in Playstore. Manually flashing Factory Image for Google Pixel is how I get me OS updates and I choose to leave bootloader unlocked, rather than relocking every month.(which would include full wipe) So I guess they don't care about security for the few users whom might use Netflix VR with Daydream compatible device? tehboogieman I'm not familiar with the Pixel, but almost every Nexus device lets you lock without wiping all your data. Maybe that requires root though, I really don't understand the details on how it works, but hopefully you can find a way to do it. Mariano Moreira To clarify: In order for me to install Factory Image every month, I need to have Bootloader unlocked. Doing the Factory unlock will wipe the device. Locking the device doesn't wipe the device, but Factory unlocking the bootloader will wipe the device. tehboogieman Yeah, sorry I wasn't more specific. I use an app called BootUnlocker. It lets you lock and unlock the bootloader without wiping at will. Since an app can do this, I'm assuming that it can be done via ADB. Also it might only work on older devices, but maybe there's a way to replicate this action on newer devices as well Mariano Moreira I don't understand why Google is promoting Security by having the device fully-locked, yet still relies on ADB fastboot unlock/OEM Unlock commands to flash factory images? saf1927 Why are using factory images when Google provides OTA images too, and these don't require an unlocked bootloader, nor a wipe? jdrch It's not just Netflix. The HDHomeRun Prime app doesn't work on rooted 7.0+ devices either. Jsilvermist Good to know, will no longer recommend Netflix to anyone when I'm asked... D13H4RD2L1V3 This is stupid. I had to root my phone to be able to hide the navbar at any time I want and also to gain better battery management controls and other stuff that I sorely wished Google had added to stock Android way sooner. And I was considering a Netflix subscription. No longer...... Sruly J I know it's not fully a solution which is "worth it", but the app Custom Navigation Bar offers the ability to hide status bar/narbar without root. Although like you said, you had other reasons to root, so... Diar I pay for Netflix so I can watch the content any way I want guilt free, whether that's their app or other locations on the Internet. F their VPN blocking and DRM. If they make their app impossible to use, I just won't use it. They'll still get my money but they will lose any data/tracking since I'll still be watching their shows, just outside of their ecosystem. Dummies. ReedSolomon Between the SJW nonsense like Bill Nye, the ipv6 tunnel blocking (rather than simply defaulting to ipv4), increases in price, less and less quality content, and now this, I see little reason to keep paying for Netflix. robogo I understand Netflix' reasons, I really do - they need to protect their property and investment. But I can't really say I understand the way they're doing this. This is a good way to alienate the small percentage of power users who root their devices for various, but perfectly valid and understandable reasons. And no, this will not make me cancel my membership as long as the app works. Cancelling membership is a silly, overblown reaction to what is, in my mind, a minor nuisance. D13H4RD2L1V3 I personally just find it a dumb move. Seems like an easy way out. Manbearpig I member when netflix released there app for Android and they did the same thing. I would just download the app and be good to go. After awhile though I stop rooting I miss it sometimes Cyber_Akuma I warned people when Pokemon GO of all things had a surprise update that silently added SafetyNet that this garbage was going to become more and more common. Mario RUN uses it too, and now Netflix.... soon apps everywhere are going to add SafetyNet and block rooted devices as standard practice. Google has been incredibly hostile towards people who actually want to own or have control over their devices or even their PC Software over the last few years. And over the last year google has been making SafetyNet more and more harsh, now even tripping if your BOOTLOADER is unlocked even if your phone is not rooted. Pokemon GO and Mario RUN were a small crowd, but I hope after Netflix of all things starts using it (and make no mistake, this is just the beginning) that people will finally push back against Google's hostility towards rooted users. BillPosters I rooted my Android phone to get rid of the annoying camera shutter sound, and to prevent apps from stealing my contacts, and to basically take control of my device rather than letting Google run the whole show, and because of that I can't update Netflix? Good riddance Netflix. Railwayman There is a better solution: Declare the device a DRM free zone and use everything else. DRM to me is "Don't Restrict Me!" and an excellent reason to give certain companies the middle finger telling them to just go and F themselves. The most ironic thing here is that removing Netflix or using DRM otherwise doesn't stop piracy. On the contrary - By buying and using DRM content you get to travel in the cargo hold with no heating while the pirating consumer get first class service: more content, no restrictions, no copyright trailers or ads before the movie start and stop on. Even better: They can use whatever apps or ROMs they want. Would I unroot my device in order to get DRM content onboard? No way!!! If Netflix are so scared - block the client on Mac OS X and Windows et al. Piracy doesn't usually happen with an Android device as a source but rather computers and HDCP rippers. Another thing also to the DRM companies: Everything that can be played back can be recorded! (Good old piracy saying) Netflix out, Fusion with Exodus, SALTS and Phoenix in. Kodi with Rapier skin is much nicer than the Netflix client and Trakt integration make this way a much better one than going down the DRM route, sitting with an uprooted stock ROM and Netflix.;) saf1927 Magisk seems to do the trick. Helios What about my non-rooted OnePlus One? It's also listed as incompatible.. '-_- 天地人 Don't OnePlus devices run a custom ROM and have unlocked bootloaders? Android Developer How can they block people who root the device from installing the app? The play store doesn't have this filter. Maybe after the install they do this check?

Offbeat | Edited by Nonika Marwaha | Updated: May 14, 2017 11:34 IST 230 Shares EMAIL PRINT COMMENTS Mothers Day 2017: Google dedicates a special doodle to all the mums. New Delhi:  Google today is celebrating Mother's day 2017 by dedicating a special doodle to all the mothers. Mother's Day is celebrated every year on the second Sunday of May. It is the day specially dedicated to the woman who devotes all her life for the well-being of her child and in return for this selfless love from her, she expects nothing. Google represents the celebration of 'motherhood' through its animated doodle and has honoured all the sacrifices' a mother makes for her child. The Google Doodle is a series of story of a pregnant cactus and her journey as a mother from giving birth to her baby cacti, to taking care of it and finally living a settled life with the grown up babies. The six different gif images show the various stages every mother has gone through during her motherhood. The first image shows a pregnancy cactus waiting to give birth and eager to take on the responsibility. The second gif image shows the process of watering the plant which represents mothers breastfeeding their kids. The third, fourth and fifth gifs show the journey of the child (the cacti) growing up under the mother's love and guidance and finally ends with a happy cacti family held together by the main character of the house, the mother. Though there is no doubt about it that every day can be celebrated as mother's day. But this day is an important occasion that gives us an opportunity to thank for all that she has done for us and to make her feel special and loved. As we grow up, we tend to become so busy and occupied with our fast growing life that we often forget her and give less time to her. We forget that she is the reason behind our growth and success. From learning how to speak till our first job interview, from learning how to walk till driving a car, from having first crush till first heartbreak she has always been with us in some or the other way. She is indeed a blessing and the best gift given to us by god. No matter what we do for her, nothing can match her selfless love and care. So, go and tell your mother what she means to you and Happy Mother's Day to all the super moms in the world!

Google rolled out an update to its Maps application a few days ago, but it seems that a number of new features were introduced with a server-side update afterward.

Netflix confirms it is blocking rooted/unlocked devices, app itself is still working (for now) Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/05/13 3:08pm PDTMay 13, 2017 127 Plus 1 on G+ 452 Share on Facebook 161 Share on Twitter Total Shares740 Applications News Earlier today, Netflix started showing up as 'incompatible' on the Play Store for rooted and unlocked Android devices. However, the app itself continued to work fine, leading some (including myself) to think it could have been an accident. However, Netflix has now confirmed to us that blocking modified devices from downloading the app was intentional. This is the full statement: With our latest 5.0 release, we now fully rely on the Widevine DRM provided by Google; therefore, many devices that are not Google-certified or have been altered will no longer work with our latest app and those users will no longer see the Netflix app in the Play Store. If you're not familiar with it, Widevine is a Google-made DRM technology that works across various desktop and mobile platforms. Widevine categorizes devices into three security levels, ranging from all processes running in the Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) to not running anything in TEE at all. However, the Play Store listing seems tied to a device's SaftetyNet status (which is used by Android Pay), rather than the Widevine TEE. For example, Artem's bootloader-unlocked stock Pixel is still on Widevine Level 1, the most secure level, but fails SafetyNet because it is unlocked. The update's changelog also confirms the: "Version 5.0 only works with devices that are certified by Google and meet all Android requirements." What isn't exactly clear is why only the Play store listing is blocked, but the app itself continued to function normally. I tried both Netflix 4.16 and 5.0.4 (the latest version, from today), and both worked without problems on my unlocked and rooted Galaxy Tab S (which is labeled as Widevine Security Level 3). Maybe at some point the app will stop working, but that does not appear to be the case right now. If you have a blocked device, I recommend following the Pushbullet channel for Netflix on APKMirror (click the Pushbullet button on that page) so you can continue to receive updates outside the Play Store.

First the vpn's now this... why oh why??? Jimk4003 Surely because licensing is regionally specific, and because rooting has the potential to defeat DRM. I get that it might be annoying for some people, but aren't the reasons obvious? David Juarez But root?? Lol Semianonymous Probably an effort to reduce Region spoofing? Idk how easy that is to do on a stock device. Jimk4003 Because rooting has the potential to defeat DRM. mjh49783ab DRM doesn't work. All DRM does is inconvenience the end user. Jimk4003 Possibly. But Netflix have to negotiate licencing deals with the movie studios, and having DRM helps reassure the studios that the movies they have spent millions of dollars making aren't going to get stolen off Netflix without any attempt to stop it. mjh49783ab One could make the argument that rooting the phone may compromise the DRM. But blocking users from unlocking their phones to switch carriers? That is total bullshit, and is just the sort of thing that encourages users to pirate the content. Jimk4003 Netflix are blocking you from switching carriers? lomsha Sim unlocked phones are fine, unlocked bootloaders are blocked. h4rr4r The studios need to reconsider blu rays then. Way easier to rip. Nothing they do will stop piracy. This kind of thing actually encourages it. Jimk4003 Maybe studios do need to consider Blu-ray's. That isn't Netflix's problem though. h4rr4r No Netflix problem is making sure they don't let the studios reduce the value of their product. If Amazon video works on my devices and Netflix does not that is a big deal to me. In that case I might as well sign up for more addon channels on Amazon with the mkney that currently goes to Netflix. Jimk4003 Agreed. But the studios are responsible for making the product they redistribute. It's certainly a balancing act, and I can see both sides of the argument, but Netflix isn't an inalienable right, and those who don't meet the T&C's are going to miss out. h4rr4r Sure, but the studios and Netflix are going to create pirates with these kind of actions. People aren't going to miss out. They will just pirate what they can't get legally. Doby Gillis whaa fucking whaa. Sergio Carmona The only obvious thing here is your sarcasm detector not working properly. Go have it fixed please. Jimk4003 Nah, I'm good. h4rr4r So the reason are to make the product worse for the consumer. Great idea, now piracy looks better and better. Jimk4003 What percentage of phones are rooted though? Most people won't care, or even notice the change. h4rr4r It does not matter, if it drives even one person to piracy that is a loss. Jimk4003 But if they can ensure better licensing deals via these new terms, which will attract more customers at the expense of a few rooted users who make up a tiny fraction of overall users; will Netflix care about that loss? h4rr4r But if it encourages piracy the other side of the contract should want to avoid it. Gaining customers in the short term like this hurts the whole market in the long term. Cyber_Akuma Because yeah, people are going to rip movies from Netflix and not off a Blu-Ray.... and even IF they were to attempt to rip them off Netflix, they would use a PHONE and not a PC.... Lord Argyris Looks like I'll have to start updating manually then. Or just not bother with the app at all since I rarely use Netflix on my phone as it is. SpasilliumNexus Thank goodness the 3T's Open Beta of OxygenOS is good enough for me to not unlock my device and stick with complete stock. Now I wonder why I haven't received any Netflix app updates beyond 4.16.1 build 15145 on the Play Store, when APKMirror has 4 newer versions. Φώτης Because unlocking your Android powered device is such a "bad" thing to do. Whatever Netflix. Ailín Ó’S Ναι, ακριβώς... 😑 C64 How about some English Rob Google translate says that "Ναι, ακριβώς" translates to "Yes, exactly". pcriz How about some Google translate :-/ asianrage Is it being Unlocked that is not allowed, or Unlocked and Rooted as well? Corbin Davenport Both. Artem can't install it on his unlocked Google Pixel XL. h4rr4r Huh? He can install it, just not from the play store. Apk mirror, soon back answer. Corbin Davenport Yes, that's what I meant. It doesn't appear on the Play Store for him. asianrage That's so shitty. lomsha Idiotic. Andreaeritzman Google is paying 97$ per hour! Work for few hours & have longer with friends and family! !sf93c: On tuesday I got a great new Land Rover Range Rover from having earned $8752 this last four weeks.. Its the most-financialy rewarding I've had.. Follow this link for more information !sf93c: ➽➽ ➽➽;➽➽ http://GoogleFinancialCashJobs383TopNovaGetPaid$97/Hour... ★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫::::::!sf93c:....,..... _jack_ I will send them feedback about this. nagi Just another step that makes pirating the same content more convenient... we should really be going the other way if they ever want piracy to be reduced. lomsha Funny thing is their content is available to stream all over the internet. Don't see how this move fights piracy as long as computers have access. This just alienates legit users who are doing nothing nefarious on unlocked/rooted devices. Richard Branches By one everybody pays... Pathum Addarapathirana Dude I root my phone to just get iPhone emojis and to tether without my carrier knowing. Like I'm not stealing anything this will just make me stop paying for Netflix. Latheryin Just a heads up. Those treating hiding mods are fake. There is no way to hide if from the carrier. Heck if they wanted to they could see every web page you load from a ton of different places and ways. Yan Minari That’s why god invented VPN Latheryin Yes but even then it doesn't block everything. qqqqqq My provider absolutely blocks tethering - I've been using various methods, including VPNs, to block it for literally YEARS... Hasn't been difficult. Dylan Harris That's not true. All you have to due to bypass tethering limits on t-mobile is to change the TTL on the tethered device. Latheryin That just gets by the automated checks. Get a live person to randomly pick your account (not really likely but happens) and it is not had to tell if someone is tethering. Android Developer Is the tether solution needed even if you do it using USB ? Fulbring What a stupid move. I pay for the premium for Netflix and I never thought that I might have to cancel my service just because they did this. The only reason why I have root is because of AdAway and TitaniumBackup. I still use the stock OnePlus 3T ROM. Wasn't expecting this at all.... Kinda suck. Will be interesting to see how many customers they lose. Julian Berger Not enough to change it back... 4Ui812 DRM has no place in our lives. I suspect Netflix will have a change of heart within 6 months. Branko Xiaomi phones say bye bye to Netflix. Google go fuck yourselves. Steve_Jobroni Go fucking buy a windows phone. 天地人 Seriously though Windows phones are great. The only problem with them is the lack of applications. Otherwise, it runs great on low-end hardware, has a great UI, the homescreen is innovative, synchronisation with Windows PCs is cool, etc. Jimk4003 This is Netflix, not Google. Cyber_Akuma Google invented this SafetyNet crap, let anyone use it for any reason (Hell, Pokemon GO of all things started using it), and over the last year have been making it even more and more strict and unforgiving. So no, a HUGE part of the blame does lie on Google for being openly hostile towards rooted users and not giving a damn about them. blindexecutioner So the solution is to install from outside the play store. That's great for security. Way to go. Richard Markert No they don't. Since Windows 7, new and default users are not Admin accounts. koiulpoi Sorry, this is absolutely wrong. The first user created on a Windows PC has full administrative access, limited by UAC. You can still delete System32, it's just mildly harder than it used to be. If "new and default users" were not Admin accounts, they couldn't install software, so... TechGuy22 Haha kodi Doesn't matter to me I Stopped paying for Netflix long time ago. C64 Haha Teranium TV 😎 TechGuy22 I like that too. You can even get the mod one and remove the ads. Lol C64 I know, i always use those. I want to pay for the dev, but there's no option to do that. Koko time is coming with a big update to tim242 Thief. Renato Santos This is stupid. Congratulations, Netflix. Jan-Lk Else It is also getting more and more necessary to unlock / root devices due to missing updates etc. But I'm not a Netflix customer and won't become one. C64 Whahaha, this has to be the most retarded move of the year in any category (even Trump can't top this). I'm glad i don't use Old Crap Flix. A Person Hillary, then Netflix. C64 Nope sorry. Since Trump is your president i can't take America serious anymore A Person Timeout, you're not even a US citizen? No interest in your opinion. Roy Riddex Just so I'm clear on this, by unlocked are we talking about SIM unlocked? lomsha No no, unlocked bootloader. Roy Riddex Thanks Corbin Davenport Unlocked bootloader. pbergonzi I wonder how long they'll stick with that premise seeing as how much public opinion expressed here is against them. Screw them. Get the APK somewhere else or install magisk and hide your root. Too many people root their devices and have a good reason for doing so and Netflix should not penalize them. Doby Gillis Dude, normal people don't give a fuck about rooted phones. It's just the elitist twats who do it anymore. twiz0r Dude, you're an elitist twat. Richard Markert Most people who root seem to be. The sentiment among rooters is "if you don't root your phone, you're not as good as me and don't deserve to have a phone. Root you stupid noob!" twiz0r thanks for confirming your twatness. good day. C64 One word ..... Bullshit Corey Kinard I've yet to see that... Maybe you just feel like that because they do in fact know more than you? Jimk4003 I'm sure Netflix are terrified that the tiny fraction of Android users who come to this site, and the similarly tiny fraction who root their phones, are bothered. The rest of the world won't care. C64 Probably 90 % of the people don't know what root is. Almost every person I know owns an Android device, but i'm the only geek who flashes and roots his devices pbergonzi Judging from the posts here it looks like nobody who roots their phone uses Netflix anyway so I guess it's moot. But the outcry sure did get them a bunch of free publicity. T4rd This is what Magisk is for. Pretty sure if I can still use Android Pay with my rooted 6P, I can still use/update Netflix through the Play Store. Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ Magisk still requires that you unlock your bootloader, which is enough to trigger safety net these days, so that won't work. TechGuy22 You don't know how magisk works do you Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ I understand that Magisk is a great tool for modifying my system without actually modifying it. I understand that there are many modules that allow you to do things like hide root, bypass security modules, skin your system, and plenty of other things. What I don't understand is how you can install magisk without unlocking your bootloader. Back when I originally tried it out with pokemon go, it worked well for a while, but eventually even just having my bootloader unlocked was all it took to throw SafetyNet. If that's not an issue anymore, then great! But maybe say that instead of being snarky. Thomas Gladdines Bootloader can be simply locked after rooting and installing a custom recovery. Edwin O. Lol no You could, but then you can't flash anything with said recovery... So no point Muzzy996 Well as an example for the Google Pixel: https://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=71901761&postcount=454 In this case all it takes is a kernel that supports Magisk and hides the fact that the bootloader is unlocked, at which point with Magisk Hide enabled all root and SafetyNet checks pass. Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ Excellent. I'll have to look back into this then, last time I used magisk it wasn't as capable, glad to see it's come this far. sbeaulieu Magical Hide is there for that Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ Can Magical Hide hide that my bootloader is unlocked? Serious question, not being sarcastic or snarky as I was below. sbeaulieu It does make the SafetyNet check pass T4rd Except it's working for me right now... jonzey231 This has been happening for a week now. I tweeted it to Ruddock a few days ago. Just didn't put together that it was because I was unlocked. https://twitter.com/jonzey231/status/862122438125072384 steelew Google really needs to start stealing from the root community the way apple takes from the jailbreak community. It feels like rooting is way down except for a few (legal) use cases. If it weren't for visual tweaks & usability tweaks, I would have no need to root (personally). This kind of stuff starts to make rooting unpleasant. I already can't use fingerprint auth in my banking app any more because root. Jesús Cuenca They do. I used rooms for like 8 years maybe? And a lot of the "new features" always come of the rom or root comunity. Right now i use roms, but not root. Marcelove I'm trying to stay indoors, but is complicate... Greenify for example, works at no root devices nowadays... But is way better with root and Xposed... Doze can't compare against Greenify... Maybe at version number 20 root wouldn't be necessary... Sandeep Raghuraman What about the version downloaded from Amazon app store though? Does that work fine? TwoBit Gary It worked, but it is old version without show downloads. Go to apkmirror oculairmedia Interesting move. I flashed a custom ROM on my Nexus 6 because stock was so slow that it was getting unusable, but screw me right ? Atoqir In my country lots of stuff doesn't work on unrooted devices. My bank app, payment app and local cable TV and digicorder app all stopped working. Also s-health doesn't work anymore and soon Netflix. Time to unroot Marcelove "Time to unroot" Sheep. Richard Markert Rooting is insecure. You don't need to access the system partition except to break things. Benjamin Walburn If that were the case then this wouldn't be an issue. Nobody is looking to break their phone. Richard Markert Few people I've talked to online know what they're doing when it comes to root. Most of those end up breaking things. Rooting is far too easy and probably shouldn't exist at all. Benjamin Walburn You could say the same about anything, not just modification of phones. Maybe you shouldn't own a car if you can't fix it yourself, or have kids if you aren't a doctor. Rooting isn't easy, it's made easy by the hard work of other people. It's not up to you what other people do with their property, you have no right to say that they shouldn't. And if someone breaks their phone, what does it have to do with you? It's their hobby and their phone. You're not their daddy. senoredusty Or use Magisk DJMix No need. You could use magisk su hide for the moment. it still passes the safetynet. I too use a banking app that cannot be used on normal root proocess faceless128 "please stop giving us money and use Kodi instead" Sounds like a great business plan! JD For the sake of Kodi's developers don't say Kodi in that context. ericshmerick Hrmm, every time I hear Kodi, I think of pirated content. Guess when people are like "I use Kodi for my 30TB media collection" I stop and wonder how... Yes, ripping a lifetime of DVDs, but nah. Probably piracy. C64 I know a few how really use it legally Powsniffer0110 Yea I use it legally 95% of the time. Mike Honestly though, if pirate add-ons wern't available on kodi, 98% of the people using it now would not have even heard of it before. Even bad publicity is good publicity. They are not going to publicly come out and say it, but the add-on's are the only reason they're well known. cbstryker Kodi is just an open source media player. To watch any pirated content you either need to download it or install an unaffiliated plugin that streams from pirated sources. C64 Next kodi wil have drm build in. So people have to use forks. I stopped using kodi since i found Teranium TV. cbstryker That makes zero sense. Kodi's reason for existing would stop. Justin D Same...but with Plex and something else >.> Dmitry Stepanushkin Xposed + RootCloak or something similar will do it for most of apps for those who need root. So I think not a big problem. Abhishek Saral Not a big problem but a big annoyance. tehboogieman Hmm, rootcloak isn't working for me with netflix m477 No, it won't work. Safetynet always fails if you have closed activated, or if you just have an unlocked bootloader. Sometimes even by just having adb debugging turned on. Kan☆n MagiskSU and its manager app comes with a very good hider built-in. No Xposed needed. h4rr4r Beyond pointless. Netflix won by being easier than piracy, this threatens to turn back the clock on that. Marcelove Funny thing: I was about to become a subscriber of Netflix after seeing House of Cards by PirateBay but now through the official channel because I thought that Netflix deserved my money... Look : deservED... But this movie will keep me at PirateBay... Funny thing 2: I have a Moto G5 that I could unlock and root and I didn't it just because I wanna see how things are nowadays without root... And I use a lot of apps that would work better with root (Greenify for example)... So I would be able to use Netflix... And I won't and will stay that way only because this douchebag move... Congratulations Netflix... Funny thing 3: So happy that I waited till House of Cards release to become a subscriber... Netflix should learn something from Frank Underwood... And from Blockbuster... tim242 Yeah, sure you were. Once a thief, always a thief. koiulpoi This is the most untrue statement I've read on this website. Thomas Elephants can fly 天地人 http://gadling.com/2012/06/10/airline-transports-herd-of-african-elephants-photos/ 天地人 Yes, because illegally pirating from huge corperations which constantly attempt to and successfully brainwash people into agenda using various tricks, is somehow bad? You're not supporting the creators of the show, sure. But you're also not supporting the 6 Jewish companies that control 90% of American media. Anyways, with your little money you wouldn't be benefitting anybody. Do you honestly think those Jewish companies are dying to get a hold of your $120 you payed for Netflix this year? Probably not. The creators of the show, are well off anyways. Don't companies pay them to have their content on their platform and pay for their production cost and wages? Then; they've already been payed. I'm not endorsing piracy. It isn't the best thing to do, but I think calling people a "thief" and grouping them with people who have actually stolen things off individuals which mean a lot to the individual and murdered some individuals in the process, is just stupid. It's not the same as 'stealing' bits of 1s and 0s. Again, I'm not endorsing piracy, however there are a lot of good reasons to pirate movies and TV shows. Trysta Noticed this a little while ago. The crazy thing is I'm not even rooted or interested in any mods. I needed to sideload the latest version 7.1.2 because my RMA Nexus 6p refused to update on its own. I'm keeping the bootloader unlocked so I can recover if my phone boot loops. I rarely use Netflix on my phone but this is kind of annoying. I suspect this has something to do with offline movie watching (which is amazing). jj14x You don't need to unlock bootloader to sideload the full OTA images that Google publishes on their website. Tim Harman But you do need it to recover in your phone bootloops, as he said. ilovetesla Dumbest blocking I've ever heard Bruce Wayne I stopped rooting ages ago. Android has gotten so good that I don't need it anymore. Muzzy996 Good for you! Not everyone feels the same though, I know I sure don't. Tasker, Adaway, Greenify, Titanium, Substratum and GMD Gesture Controls are all more important to me than Netflix. The day Netflix stops working on my rooted devices (which are what I watch it on, not my TV) is the day I'll cancel my service. No big loss compared to losing root. Richard Markert Tasker is interesting but never felt the need for it. Adaway, titanium are both irrelevant on my S7, I despise gestures beyond simple swiping in the Cardinal directions, and if stock Android is so perfect why do you need to theme it? C64 I have a s7 edge and the stockrom is full of bloatware from Microsoft, Sansung and Google. More than 20 useless apps are included. So yes the s7 needed root. tim242 Wrong. Package Disabler, no root required. Muzzy996 Never said android is perfect, if it was there wouldn't be any competition in the market or users such as myself who feel the need to customize Android. Root is not something I push onto others, its just something that I want on my devices and I make choices about what services I use or devices I purchase based upon my ability to do it. kostas110 maybe if you use some 500+ euro smartphone from 2016-2017 something that not everyone can do C64 I disagree, Android is one big advertising if you don't use root. Apps have ads (not every app has a pro version), internet browsing sucks without Adaway (build in ad blockers in browsers aren't great), YouTube really sucks if it isn't modded (watch a 30 second ad for a 3 minute movie). And devices are full of bloatware that can't be removed without root. Even the Google stuff are bloatware (kiosk, movies,music,books etc). I also like to remove alot of system apps and replace them with my own apps that i prefer (file manager, agenda, email, music/ video player) and i really hate duplicate apps on my devices. Also Titanium Backup is important to me. So Android​ without root isn't Android for me. jetscreamer01 I use adguard to block stupid ads in my apps. Now using any commercial apps is enjoyable. Cyber_Akuma I hate this response. If anything, I have found far more reasons to root than ever before. Being able to create a backup image and install security/tracking software tat can't just be wiped/uninstalled easily is a big one for example. DJMix I really couldn't understand these kind of stupid moves. I mean I kinda get for an Android Pay or some banking apps to implement these limitations. But seriously, a frickin' streaming app? Afraid they're gonna get pirated? For someone who's going to pirate, they probably could just probably reverse engineer the apk and remove the limitations or basically use older apps. Do they really have some idle engineers that they're forced to implement useless feature? ddevito Guess I'll just pirate it all soon. Their loss. JD Fuck Android If OEMs would fucking provide updates for 5 years I wouldn't need to unlock my bootloader. I'm out. I'll come back when Google fixes this shit. Also fuck Netflix. Back to pirating it is. Christopher Bement My app stopped working on my N7 when I sideloaded 5.0. Got an error when trying to play anything. I went and dropped it back to stock on the latest patch and relocked the bootloader. All working fine now. Too fucking bad, Nougat is fantastic on that device, leaps and bounds better than Marshmallow. tehboogieman Which ROM and which N7 do you have? I still have the stock ROM on my 2013 N7 LTE and have been procrastinating loading an N ROM on it Christopher Bement 2013 LTE version and I was using Nitrogen OS (fantastic and stable ROM). I am now on the latest Marshmallow just so that Netflix will work. tehboogieman As long as I can side load it and sign in I'm still ok. It's a pain, but I'd live with that. But if NF blocks root users from signing in, I'm definitely cancelling and just use one of the very easy pirate apps. Wayne Randall I just signed up for Netflix so I could cancel it. I'm part of the group. tim242 You paid them... Richard Markert Hahahahahaha I don't even use Netflix on my phone (screen is too small) so I don't care. But man, the tears and butthurt from the root community is hilarious. Benjamin Walburn You're a very petty child. Richard Markert When something makes me laugh, I point it out. I do that even have a dog in this hunt. I only watch Netflix on my 75" LED TV. I'm just tired of root users smugness. Almost as smug as apple users. Benjamin Walburn You're tired of people being smug in their hobbies, so you gloat about the problems inflicted on them pointlessly? Petty and a hypocrite. Richard Markert What else am I supposed to do to remove the smugness? My name is…. Get a life maybe? Benjamin Walburn Why should you? Is another person's happiness really that painful for you? You already know that they accomplished nothing more than "successfully followed instructions." It seems like your purpose would be better served by targeting that, not just being a jerk. Humbling them is one thing, being an ass is another entirely. tim242 You sound like the petty child. Stomp your foot, becauseyou don't get your way. Benjamin Walburn Not only am I not doing that, I'm not not getting my way, and "stomping​ my foot" is not an example of pettiness. Your wrongness-density is impressive. My name is…. Who beat you as a child? Richard Markert Lol koiulpoi You're on androidpolice.com... making fun of the root community... and unable to see past the end of your nose... Don't you have anything better to do? lomsha Tard me me A primary reason to root is to run adblock because Google is way too greedy. So the irony, Google's greed means there's less reason to pay for NetFlix. Let me guess... shall we? Google Play Movies still works right...? Oh yes, so long as Google makes their money.... tim242 I block ads with Adguard. No root required. Mike | Homeless On Wheels People still use Netflix? Bit Torrent is your friend. dizel123 Exactly. Everyone should stop using Netflix. Not sure how I'm gonna get the shows i currently watch on Netflix from bit torrent since they won't be made anymore once Netflix is shut down, but at least I'll have my bit torrent friend tim242 Some people like to do things properly. derp_cookies So I agree this is a dumb move but everyone is overreacting by threatening to pirate content. This is a niche problem as less people root now, especially since Android pay won't work when you do it. So Netflix isn't any less accessible than it was before. I watch 99% of Netflix at home on my Roku. Luxferro It's not just rooting. My Nexus 6P is running stock google rom, no root, w/ just unlocked bootloader, and netflix is gone in my play store. Not that I watch TV on my phone... but my shield tv is also unlocked... so it's probably just a matter of time. Roh_Mish Dammit Netflix, you make me want to go popcorn time route. My current primary phone and my iPad are what I use to watch netflix and both of them is stock so i don't have anything to worry about but this just feels wrong. Between this and Amazon not releasing the TV app for my sony TV, which they support outside, popcorn time (and in extension piracy) just seems easier. Vivek Rameses This is why we have piracy. Miguel Angel But ...why? occono Distributors want Netflix to stop any possibility of making DRM-Free backups on the content. Mariano Moreira Even more strange is while Netflix app is removed from Playstore, Netflix VR is still.in Playstore. Manually flashing Factory Image for Google Pixel is how I get me OS updates and I choose to leave bootloader unlocked, rather than relocking every month.(which would include full wipe) So I guess they don't care about security for the few users whom might use Netflix VR with Daydream compatible device? tehboogieman I'm not familiar with the Pixel, but almost every Nexus device lets you lock without wiping all your data. Maybe that requires root though, I really don't understand the details on how it works, but hopefully you can find a way to do it. Mariano Moreira To clarify: In order for me to install Factory Image every month, I need to have Bootloader unlocked. Doing the Factory unlock will wipe the device. Locking the device doesn't wipe the device, but Factory unlocking the bootloader will wipe the device. tehboogieman Yeah, sorry I wasn't more specific. I use an app called BootUnlocker. It lets you lock and unlock the bootloader without wiping at will. Since an app can do this, I'm assuming that it can be done via ADB. Also it might only work on older devices, but maybe there's a way to replicate this action on newer devices as well Mariano Moreira I don't understand why Google is promoting Security by having the device fully-locked, yet still relies on ADB fastboot unlock/OEM Unlock commands to flash factory images? saf1927 Why are using factory images when Google provides OTA images too, and these don't require an unlocked bootloader, nor a wipe? jdrch It's not just Netflix. The HDHomeRun Prime app doesn't work on rooted 7.0+ devices either. Jsilvermist Good to know, will no longer recommend Netflix to anyone when I'm asked... D13H4RD2L1V3 This is stupid. I had to root my phone to be able to hide the navbar at any time I want and also to gain better battery management controls and other stuff that I sorely wished Google had added to stock Android way sooner. And I was considering a Netflix subscription. No longer...... Sruly J I know it's not fully a solution which is "worth it", but the app Custom Navigation Bar offers the ability to hide status bar/narbar without root. Although like you said, you had other reasons to root, so... Diar I pay for Netflix so I can watch the content any way I want guilt free, whether that's their app or other locations on the Internet. F their VPN blocking and DRM. If they make their app impossible to use, I just won't use it. They'll still get my money but they will lose any data/tracking since I'll still be watching their shows, just outside of their ecosystem. Dummies. ReedSolomon Between the SJW nonsense like Bill Nye, the ipv6 tunnel blocking (rather than simply defaulting to ipv4), increases in price, less and less quality content, and now this, I see little reason to keep paying for Netflix. robogo I understand Netflix' reasons, I really do - they need to protect their property and investment. But I can't really say I understand the way they're doing this. This is a good way to alienate the small percentage of power users who root their devices for various, but perfectly valid and understandable reasons. And no, this will not make me cancel my membership as long as the app works. Cancelling membership is a silly, overblown reaction to what is, in my mind, a minor nuisance. D13H4RD2L1V3 I personally just find it a dumb move. Seems like an easy way out. Manbearpig I member when netflix released there app for Android and they did the same thing. I would just download the app and be good to go. After awhile though I stop rooting I miss it sometimes Cyber_Akuma I warned people when Pokemon GO of all things had a surprise update that silently added SafetyNet that this garbage was going to become more and more common. Mario RUN uses it too, and now Netflix.... soon apps everywhere are going to add SafetyNet and block rooted devices as standard practice. Google has been incredibly hostile towards people who actually want to own or have control over their devices or even their PC Software over the last few years. And over the last year google has been making SafetyNet more and more harsh, now even tripping if your BOOTLOADER is unlocked even if your phone is not rooted. Pokemon GO and Mario RUN were a small crowd, but I hope after Netflix of all things starts using it (and make no mistake, this is just the beginning) that people will finally push back against Google's hostility towards rooted users. BillPosters I rooted my Android phone to get rid of the annoying camera shutter sound, and to prevent apps from stealing my contacts, and to basically take control of my device rather than letting Google run the whole show, and because of that I can't update Netflix? Good riddance Netflix. Railwayman There is a better solution: Declare the device a DRM free zone and use everything else. DRM to me is "Don't Restrict Me!" and an excellent reason to give certain companies the middle finger telling them to just go and F themselves. The most ironic thing here is that removing Netflix or using DRM otherwise doesn't stop piracy. On the contrary - By buying and using DRM content you get to travel in the cargo hold with no heating while the pirating consumer get first class service: more content, no restrictions, no copyright trailers or ads before the movie start and stop on. Even better: They can use whatever apps or ROMs they want. Would I unroot my device in order to get DRM content onboard? No way!!! If Netflix are so scared - block the client on Mac OS X and Windows et al. Piracy doesn't usually happen with an Android device as a source but rather computers and HDCP rippers. Another thing also to the DRM companies: Everything that can be played back can be recorded! (Good old piracy saying) Netflix out, Fusion with Exodus, SALTS and Phoenix in. Kodi with Rapier skin is much nicer than the Netflix client and Trakt integration make this way a much better one than going down the DRM route, sitting with an uprooted stock ROM and Netflix.;) saf1927 Magisk seems to do the trick. Helios What about my non-rooted OnePlus One? It's also listed as incompatible.. '-_- 天地人 Don't OnePlus devices run a custom ROM and have unlocked bootloaders? Android Developer How can they block people who root the device from installing the app? The play store doesn't have this filter. Maybe after the install they do this check?

The speakers who came on stage during keynotes had stylish hair. "Do they have dressers backstage?" an attendee asked a group of us when it was all over. Images: Alex Cranz/Gizmodo Build exists to get developers excited. The biggest devs blow upwards of $US2000 ($2709) for a three-day pass to the event, where they have unlimited drinks, plentiful meals and access to Microsoft's best and brightest. Part of Microsoft's wooing process involves appearing "hip" to a group of developers who resemble the cast of Silicon Valley in all the worst ways. Hence the light show and Microsoft EVP Terry Myerson's questionable hoodie and leather vest combo. It wants these devs so amped that they will rush back to their MacBook Airs and Surface Books to crank out brilliant software, hopefully for Microsoft's Windows Store, which has just one third of the apps of much cooler stores from Google and Apple. With the arrival of Windows 10 S, which can only use apps from the Windows Store, the app marketplace has never been more important than today. Yet time after time over the course of the event, Microsoft dropped the ball on its pitch to developers in favour of niche distractions. Apple's a monolith of money and users, and thanks to Android and Chrome OS, Google is right there with it. Both have OS platforms with heavily used app stores. They have built customer bases of hungry fans that enthusiastically embrace their hardware and software products, and consequently, developers want to build apps that work with Apple and Google platforms. Microsoft, on the other hand, can't seem to ditch the buttoned-up association it's developed for making the work computer you don't want to use. Its reputation is seemingly forever cemented by those old Mac vs PC commercials. Attempts to rewrite the script have been met with mixed success. On the hardware side, Microsoft has become a genuine player in the field of coveted kit. The Surface Pro and Studio are ambitious devices that are legitimately exciting. The Surface Laptop announced earlier this month is one of the most interesting products announced so far this year. But Microsoft's software landscape is still dorktown and one of the big ways Microsoft's attempting to undorkify things is by leaning into the Windows Store. There's a problem though. Microsoft's app store in uncommonly small compared to the other guys. According to Microsoft, in 2015 there were just 669,000 apps available. (The company hasn't officially updated that number since.) According to Statista Apple and Google both have more than three times that number of apps available in their stores. The number of available apps alone doesn't necessarily dictate the quality of someone's computing experience, but it remains a common metric for success, and if Microsoft wants to look cooler in the software space, it needs a big awesome app store full of big awesome apps. Microsoft stunned the audience of Build when it announced iTunes was coming to the store just a week after announcing Spotify's arrival. Those are two hugely important apps, and you could feel the energy in the keynote after the announcement. Developers and press looked at one another, baffled and delighted. An Apple app would appear in the Windows Store! Then Microsoft immediately squandered that excitement. The rest of the focus both on stage and later in the "Hub," the primary showroom for the conference, wasn't on the cool apps traditional users might want, but on the deeply nerdy niche stuff. During the keynote itself, Microsoft glossed over the lifestyle apps to focus on Autodesk and Linux. Autodesk was up on stage to announce that Autodesk Stingray was headed to the store. Stingray is an engine used to build things in 3D and is almost exclusively used by 3D artists and engineers. After that announcement, Microsoft followed up with the news that Linux was coming to the store. If you're excited about the Linux distributions Ubuntu, Suse and Fedora arriving to the Windows Store, know you're uncommon. It's big news for developers, but meaningless to people who would normally seek out apps on an app store in the first place. Site of the Build keynote. There are lots of blue lights and...fog? Given Microsoft's enthusiasm for the store, it was weird that the company's newly announced operating system, Windows 10 S, which can only get apps through the store, was mostly absent from the conference, apart from a few mentions during the keynote. You couldn't find it anywhere on the show floor, where developers mingle with Microsoft personnel. Nerd city. The Store booth had a lone TV screen with a rep standing in front of it — and that rep had not been briefed on Windows 10 S. In fact, it seemed no one had. Every Microsoft rep I asked seemed bewildered by Windows 10 S questions. They could say it was "exciting" but they had no spiel ready for why it was exciting, nor why the Store was crucial to its success. And no one could explain what, fundamentally, might have changed about the Windows Store to make it an appealing avenue for app launches after a five years of sluggish adoption. Even app developers that were bullish about the platform were frustratingly vague about what was different now compared to when the Store launched in 2012, and why Windows 10 S would not go the way of its failed store-focused predecessors Windows RT and Windows 8.1 with Bing. Christoph Teschner and Michael Simmons were positively giddy about Windows 10 S when I sat down with them in a high-rise hotel near the conference. Both men are employees of Algoriddim, and were in Seattle because their app, DJay Pro, had just received the App Creator of the Year award. "I think that's the future," Simmons said of the Windows App store. Teschner pointed to his own youth, growing up with Apple's app stores for Mac and iOS and how it had prepared him for the Windows Store. "People are used to app stores now," he said. "It felt sort of natural to me when I first got my Windows Store." Though they were reluctant to give exact numbers or concrete evidence of a successful Windows Store launch, Simmons said "Windows fulfilled our expectations." He praised the development process in particular. "Seeing developer tools ten years ago, it's a total leap today. It's an evolution and we're in the middle of it." Neither man could give a concrete reason for why they felt Windows 10 S had a chance to succeed when its predecessors failed so badly, but sitting in a room and soaking up their optimism it was hard not to be swayed a little. And it's that kind of optimism for app developers that Microsoft will need if it hopes to actually fill the Store with cool apps. If those men had been on the show floor, showing off their app and talking up their own experiences with developing for the store, Build might have actually projected the image Microsoft desperately needs. But Microsoft is still figuring it out. It has ditched the pocket protector, but it's still not cool. WATCH MORE: Tech News Comments soldant @soldant May 14, 2017, 11:48am Honestly I think MS allowing you to upgrade out of Windows 10 S for free is an admission that it isn't going to do well. Almost nobody wants Windows Store apps - most of them are served by better quality desktop apps or by a browser tab. The Windows Store can't seem to make up its mind whether it wants to be an answer to iOS/Android apps (and that market clearly has no room for a third competitor) or a replacement for desktop apps (where it routinely fails). Basically, it's just an alternative to options that frankly work better. The cynic in me sees it as an MS attempt at ultimately pushing towards a closed platform in the consumer market - but that didn't work for Apple with MacOS and it's got no hope in hell of working here. Reply 2 lee978 @978lee May 14, 2017, 4:40pm Microsoft are looking enviously at Apple & Android App Stores. The control this gives them, as well as the data and the revenue is serving them well. However much of Microsoft appeal is the fact you don't have to use their App store. The privacy this gives users, the flexibility, user control and potential cost savings is part of Windows appeal. Take this away and they will lose customers. Reply 0 Join the discussion! Log In Sign Up Guest Access Join the discussion! Cancel Reply Log In / Sign Up Name Email You are starting a new discussion.

Google is transforming public education in the U.S. with low-cost laptops and free apps, in turn helping to drive a philosophical change — prioritizing skills such as teamwork and problem-solving while de-emphasizing the teaching of traditional academic knowledge, such as math formulas.  (SASHA MASLOV / THE NEW YORK TIMES)   By NATASHA SINGERThe New York Times Sat., May 13, 2017 CHICAGO—The sixth-graders at Newton Bateman, a public elementary school here, know the Google drill. In a social-science class last year, the students each grabbed a Google-powered laptop. They opened Google Classroom, an app where teachers make assignments. Then they clicked on Google Docs, a writing program, and began composing essays. Chicago Public Schools, the third-largest school district in the United States, with about 381,000 students, is at the forefront of a profound shift in U.S. education: the Googlification of the classroom. In five years, Google has helped upend the sales methods companies use to place their products in classrooms. It has enlisted teachers and administrators to promote Google’s products to other schools. It has directly reached out to educators to test its products — effectively bypassing senior district officials. And it has outmanoeuvred Apple and Microsoft with a powerful combination of low-cost laptops, called Chromebooks, and free classroom apps. Today, more than half of primary- and secondary-school students in the U.S. — more than 30 million children — use Google education apps such as Gmail and Docs, the company said. And Chromebooks, Google-powered laptops that initially struggled to find a purpose, now account for more than half the mobile devices shipped to U.S. schools. Article Continued Below “Between the fall of 2012 and now, Google went from an interesting possibility to the dominant way that schools around the country” teach students to find information, create documents and turn them in, said Hal Friedlander, former chief information officer for the New York City Department of Education. In doing so, Google is helping to drive a philosophical change in public education — prioritizing training children in skills such as teamwork and problem-solving while de-emphasizing the teaching of traditional academic knowledge, such as math formulas. It puts Google, and the tech economy, at the centre of one of the great debates that has raged in U.S. education for more than a century: whether the purpose of public schools is to turn out knowledgeable citizens or skilled workers. Schools may be giving Google more than they are getting: generations of future customers. Google makes $30 per device by selling management services for the millions of Chromebooks that ship to schools. But by habituating students to its offerings at a young age, Google obtains something much more valuable. Every year, several million American students graduate from high school. And not only does Google make it easy for those who have school Google accounts to upload their trove of school Gmail, Docs and other files to regular Google consumer accounts — but schools encourage them to do so. Some parents warn that Google could profit by using personal details from their children’s school email to build more powerful marketing profiles of them as young adults. Jonathan Rochelle, director of Google’s education apps group, said that when students transfer their school emails and files to a personal Google account, that account is governed by Google’s privacy policy. “Personal Gmail accounts may serve ads,” he said, but files in Google Drive are “never scanned for the purpose of showing ads.” In 2013, Rochelle, a co-developer of Google Docs, set up a team at Google to create apps specifically for schools. To spread those tools, Jaime Casap, Google’s global education evangelist, began travelling around the U.S. with a motivational message: Rather than tout specific Google products, Casap told educators that they could improve their students’ college and career prospects by creatively using online tools. But that also caused problems in Chicago and another district when Google went looking for teachers to try a new app — effectively bypassing district administrators. In both cases, Google found itself reined in. Google derives most of its revenue from online advertising — much of it targeted through sophisticated use of people’s data. Google declined to provide a breakdown of the exact details the company collects from student use of its services. Bram Bout, director of Google’s education unit, pointed to a Google privacy notice listing the categories of information that the company’s education services collect, such as location data and “details of how a user used our service.” Bout said that student data in Google’s core education services (including Gmail, Calendar and Docs) “is only used to provide the services themselves, so students can do things like communicate using email.” These services do not show ads, he said, and “do not use personal data resulting from use of these services to target ads.” *** In 2006, Casap persuaded Arizona State University officials to scrap their costly internal email service and replace it with a free version of the Gmail-and-Docs package that Google had been selling to companies. In one semester, the vast majority of the university’s approximately 65,000 students signed up. Northwestern University, the University of Southern California and many others followed. This became Google’s education marketing playbook: Woo school officials with easy-to-use, money-saving services. Then enlist schools to market to other schools. Casap decided to try the strategy with public schools. As it happened, officials at the Oregon Department of Education were looking to help local schools cut their email costs, said Steve Nelson, a former department official. In 2010, the state officially made Google’s education apps available to its school districts. Google then developed a growth strategy aimed at teachers, who could influence the administrators who make technology decisions. *** At Chicago Public Schools, the teacher-centric strategy played out almost perfectly. In 2012, Jennie Magiera, then a fourth-grade teacher in Chicago, wanted her students to use Google Docs. Because the district wasn’t yet using Google’s apps, she said, she independently set up six consumer accounts for her class. Chicago Public Schools was looking to trim the $2 million a year it was spending on Microsoft Exchange and another email service. In March 2012, the district chose Google. In interviews, Chicago administrators said they asked Google to sign a contract agreeing, among other things, to comply with the federal Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act. That law permits federally funded educational institutions to share students’ personally identifiable information with certain school vendors, provided those companies use that information only for school purposes. Instead, Google initially proposed abiding by its own company policies, said Edward Wagner, the district’s director of infrastructure services, and followed up by emailing links to those policies — terms that the company could change at any time. Bout of Google said that the tech company had “always taken the compliance needs of our education users seriously.” Today, Google’s standard agreements with schools for its education apps include a commitment to comply with that law. Since adopting Google apps, Chicago schools have saved about $1.6 million annually on email and related costs, a district spokesperson said. *** In 2014, Google’s education juggernaut hit a speed bump in Chicago Public Schools. Google had hoped that Chicago would become an early adopter of Google Classroom, its new app to help teachers take attendance, assign homework and do other tasks. But Google had not anticipated Margaret Hahn. At the time, she was the school system’s director of technology change management. Early on, she said, Google had invited teachers to try an initial version of Classroom, without first contacting the school district’s technology administrators. Now Google wanted Chicago Public Schools to switch on the app districtwide, she said, before determining whether it complied with local student-protection policies. In an emailed statement, Bout said of the company’s core education services, “In all cases, the use of these services is tied to the approval of an administrator who is responsible for overseeing a school’s domain.” Google envisioned Classroom as a kind of “mission control” dashboard where teachers could more efficiently manage tasks such as assigning and correcting homework. To create the app, they collaborated closely with teachers. In May 2014, Google posted an announcement online, asking for volunteers to beta-test Classroom. More than 100,000 teachers worldwide responded, the company said. That August, Google made Classroom available to schools. That was too fast for Chicago Public Schools. Administrators there wanted to test Classroom first to make sure it complied with district policies and fit their teachers’ needs. So they set up a pilot program, involving about 275 teachers and several thousand students, to run for the entire school year. Every month, Hahn said, she collected teachers’ feedback and sent it to Google. One immediate problem administrators identified: School board policy required employees to keep records of cyberbullying and other problematic comments. But Classroom initially did not do that. If a student wrote something offensive and a teacher deleted it, there was no archive. Google eventually added an archiving feature. The next fall, the Chicago district switched on Classroom. Teachers there later vetted other Google products, effectively becoming a test lab for the company. Google’s ability to test its products on such a monumental scale has stoked concerns about whether the tech giant is exploiting public-school teachers and students for free labour. “It’s a private company very creatively using public resources — in this instance, teachers’ time and expertise — to build new markets at low cost,” said Patricia Burch, an associate professor of education at the University of Southern California. Rochelle, the Google executive, said that it was important for the company to have large, diverse sets of educational users giving feedback. “Our goal is to build products that help educators and students,” Rochelle said. “Teachers tell us they appreciate the opportunity to get involved early and help shape our products to meet their needs.” Read more about: Google, Apple, Microsoft Delivered dailyThe Morning Headlines Newsletter Subscribe The Toronto Star and thestar.com, each property of Toronto Star Newspapers Limited, One Yonge Street, 4th Floor, Toronto, ON, M5E 1E6.

It still looks and functions basically the same as the Google Maps you know and potentially love, but Google has smartly integrated some Street View features directly into the navigation view. When you ask the app for directions, you can swipe up from the bottom of the screen to see the all the turn-by-turn steps as before. But now each step is accompanied by a Street View image of that exact turn. Popular Searches Microsoft Corp MSFT ▼ 68.38 -0.08 -0.12% If that sounds familiar, it's because Google added it to the web version of Maps many year ago, in 2008 in fact (as Android Police notes). Tapping on the Street View image opens it up full-screen, properly facing the direction you're going on the route. Most people are probably happy enough with the info provided by the turn-by-turn navigation, but if you're the type to get a little lost these images might help you prepare for the route. The default view when you pop open the Google Maps app has changed a bit, as well. Now, the bottom third or so of the screen contains info relevant to the time of day and your location, like local lunch spots. Google's had this location-specific info in Maps for a long time now; they're just surfacing it in a more obvious way here. These changes should all be available in Google Maps for Android now, but they haven't rolled out to the iOS app just yet. Given how Google is keen on keeping its apps in parity, these new features will likely hit the iPhone before long.

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars ENTREPRENEUR Guest Can Google’s 20% time really work for your startup? David Mytton, Server Density@davidmytton May 13, 2017 2:33 PM Image Credit: dotshock/Shutterstock Google’s 20 percent time is one of the most famous, and arguably successful, management practices of all time. In their 2004 IPO letter, Google’s founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin revealed that the policy of allowing employees to take time out of their core jobs to be creative and experimental had led to some of the company’s most successful products. AdSense, which now accounts for about 25 percent of Google’s total revenue, Gmail, Google Transit and Google News were all born out of 20 percent time. Facebook, LinkedIn and Apple have all implemented their own versions of 20 percent time, but as huge and highly successful technology companies with money to spare, it’s a bet they can afford to make. How does a small or medium sized business free up 20 percent of its employees’ time without jeopardizing the bottom line? Adapt to suit your business At Google employees are allowed to use their 20 percent time when they like, but in a small company a more planned approach may be necessary to ensure there’s always enough resource working on the core product or business. At Server Density we give our engineers a quota of one week out of every six to work on whatever they like, as long as it’s relevant to the company; something we call a “random week.” This policy has resulted in some key product innovations for us. For example, one of our developers chose to use several of his random weeks over a period of several months to refactor and reimplement our server-monitoring time series graphing engine. We would get regular reports of minor graphing bugs, which were small on their own but added up to make our graphing a pain point for customers. We didn’t focus on it in our usual roadmap because we had higher priority feature requests. After several of our larger customers made similar complaints, we decided to take our developer’s random-week work and have the entire frontend team focus on it to completion. Guide how employees use their time It seems an obvious point, but the spirit of 20 percent time is to allow as much free rein to your employees as possible. Small businesses that need to keep a closer eye on return on time investment could set some parameters on how the time is used, or alternatively set up some kind of ranking of pain points that need solving within the business, with an incentive system for coming up with solutions. That way you can gently encourage creativity in the most useful direction. LinkedIn held regular hack days giving awards to people who wrote snippets of code quickly. Later they introduced the LinkedIn InCubator, where employees were allowed up to 90 days to work on a project, with check points at each month to check the projects were worthwhile. InCubator gave rise to a number of useful products, including a toolkit for pointing out new features as users move around the LinkedIn site. Encourage positive slacking When struggling with the idea of giving your employees one day in five, or whatever proportion of time you decide, to use as they wish, remember that no one is ever 100 percent productive with their time. By encouraging employees to work on side projects you are at least allowing them to “slack off” productively. You will also ensure they feel valued and encourage a positive, engaged culture, especially if those projects then get incorporated into core (or new) products. It’s also a very good way to allow your team time to learn new technologies, improve their skills, and stay up to date with the industry. This can be difficult to achieve given how fast things move in tech and when formal “training” sessions and conferences can often be boring or not particularly useful. Although the graphing rewrite project at our company was started by one engineer as a way to move an old area of code from the Backbone to Facebook’s React framework, the rest of the team also learned new techniques from the migration. Updating legacy code is always challenging. One of the engineers on the project wrote a blog post about the lessons learned; another was able to explore some complex color selection algorithms, an area of particular interest to her. What started as an engineering project crossed over to help our marketing team publish high quality content, which our customer success team is now using as part of an upcoming webinar to existing customers. The benefits can be seen across the business. Whatever system you come up with, encouraging creativity among your developers not only makes sound business sense from a product development point of view, it will also help you attract the best talent. A recent report from Stack Overflow ranked the opportunity for professional development as one of the top five job benefits for developers, so offering this policy will help with recruiting and retention, which, in today’s increasingly competitive market for talent, is almost reason enough. David Mytton is founder and CEO of Server Density.

Thanks to NASA and Google Earth now you can watch the city grow and shift over the decades. The timelapse project was launched in partnership with NASA and several other research bodies and allows you to see how our planet has changed. Google combined over 5 million satellite images taken over the past three decades by 5 different satellites to give a picture of the changing face of our world since 1984. The images taken between 1984 and 2016 show how Bristol has changed including the addition of new housing estates and roads. Click below to watch Bristol change before your eyes. The images were originally collected as part of an ongoing joint mission between the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and NASA called Landsat. Since the 1970s, the Landsat mission's satellites have been observing the Earth from space. Google started working with the USGS in 2009 to make this historic archive of earth imagery available online.

A Sunday People investigation reveals the online fraudsters lure travellers with ­ fake ­websites created with photos and descriptions stolen from genuine sites. They set up a pay-per-click arrangement with Google for key words such as “Balearic villas”, meaning their company is listed at the top of the search engine. But after thousands of pounds are handed over – encouraged by discounts for payment in full – the deception unfolds when contact dries up. A genuine website listing for a property in Crete A fake website listing for the same property We launched our probe after the police Action Fraud reporting centre revealed that more than 100 people a week are being cheated out of their holidays. Dozens only realise they have been duped when they travel to properties and find them occupied by customers who have booked via the real companies. Nearly 6,000 victims lost £7.2million to cloned holiday websites last year, a rise of 20 per cent on 2015. One slick website, Canaries Holiday Villas, claims to create “the perfect holiday experience for you”. It boasts of hundreds of properties scattered across the Canary Islands ­including “Villa Azaleria”, a four-bedroom house with a pool in Lanzarote. A fake website for a property in Majorca The real website for the Majorca property After emailing the site, our investigator was told: “I am pleased to inform you that I have availability of the villa for your dates 18 to 25 June. “The total cost is £1,800, plus deposit of £500 fully refundable on inspection of property after departure. “To confirm the reservation you have 2 options – total prepayment with a ­discount of 10 per cent or payment of the 50% + security deposit and the balance 3 weeks before arrival.” The site also boasts: “With our 7 years experience, our knowledge worldwide means you can relax from the moment you choose one of our villas and we will do the rest for you. “You can book with confidence as our properties are verified by us for your peace of mind.” In fact, this is a claim they have stolen from a genuine holiday company, Villas Away, as well as images and words from a range of legitimate villa firms, including Villa Plus, based in St Albans. Pictures of “staff” had been lifted from genuine businesses. A fake website for a Canary Islands property with a fake contact listed The real profile of the contact for the property The supposed ­property manager is identical to an Australian real estate company staff member. Despite claiming to be in operation for seven years, the site Canariesholidayvillas.com was only registered six months ago. Villa Plus co-owner Nick Cooper confirmed the “Villa Azaleria” ­property in Lanzarote was on his books as Villa Azurra and is unavailable for the week we had been ­offered by the scammers. He said: “It is a real battle against the crooks and sometimes I feel as if I am the only person trying to shut them down. “Taxi drivers started telling us about customers turning up at our properties earlier this year, only to find out that they had be ripped off by these websites. Most find out when details fail to materialise but some have been stranded overseas. It is shocking that they are able to get away with this.” Villa Plus co-owner Nick Cooper says it is a battle to fight the crooks Mr Cooper’s company rents out 1,500 properties and believes some 5,000 of their website’s ­images have been cloned. Our probe found Balearic Villa Escapes, Rent Holiday Villas and Greek Villa Escapes operate in the same way as Canaries Holiday Villas. A week in June at Casa Lluna, a four-bedroom apartment on a hill above Pollenca, in Majorca, costs £4,596. But the crooks behind Balearic Villa Escapes, who pay Google to be top of the search engine, offered the property to our reporter for £3,150, after lifting the words and photos from Simpson Travel. They emailed to reassure our reporter the booking will be made under their bogus “Peace of Mind Payment Protection” scheme and directed her to a page on their site which said it only applies for a “wire bank transfer directly to the owner bank account”. Families are urged to investigate a website before making any bookings (stock photo) (Photo: Getty) After getting a scan of her passport and full address, Balearic Villa Escapes sent our investigator a professional-looking contract asking for full payment into the account of Pavel Sandor. It had been set up with Cashplus bank, which boasts on its site that a current ­account can be “opened within four ­minutes” and doesn’t let a “credit check get in the way”. Simpson Travel, of south-west London, said: “This Casa Lluna apartment has been cloned from our site and promoted by an unscrupulous company. We will be taking legal action. “We are extremely concerned potential customers are being deceived and urge customers to do their research and ensure that they book with a bonded villa operator.” Nick Cooper, of Villa Plus, added: “I warned about Greek Villa Escapes by starting a TripAdvisor thread last month. Read More Brit holiday-makers paying up to FOUR times the cost of their plane ticket for European airport transfers “But the crooks complained and Trip Advisor responded by banning my ­account and deleting all the warnings, despite me showing clear evidence that they are crooks. “After 30 years in this industry, I’ve never seen such a disgraceful attitude by big companies to consumer protection.” Fraudsters also increasingly target popular sites such as Owners Direct, Airbnb and HomeAway, which list ­hundreds of holiday homes to rent. Crooks either hack into these sites or list a number of fake properties to tempt customers to hand over cash. Charlotte Banks, 34, of Horley, Surrey, was looking forward to a hen party after her group of friends rented a house in Cornwall via Owners Direct. Ten days before arrival, she called the property owner to arrange a late checkout – to find there was no record of the booking and he’d never heard of her party. She said: “The owner was a phishing victim who’d had his emails hacked by a fraudster who intercepted my friend’s inquiry via the online booking form. Fraudsters also increasingly target popular sites such as Owners Direct, Airbnb and HomeAway (stock photo) (Photo: Getty) “The fraudster replied pretending to be the home owner and my friend handed over the best part of £1,500. “My friend reported it to the police. Her account is with Barclays and the money was paid into an account at the same bank, set up with fake ­details – but there was nothing they could do either.” This week, City of London Police National Fraud Intelligence Bureau launches a campaign to beat the bogus ­holiday companies. It is acting in conjunction with the Association of British Travel Agents and information website Get Safe Online. Campaigners warn the official toll of fraud victims is probably just the tip of the iceberg. They say embarrassment at being duped means many of those affected fail to report scams. Action Fraud’s deputy head Steve Proffitt said: “The ­impact of falling victim to holiday fraud can be far greater than the financial loss. “We hope that by raising awareness, people will feel better able to protect themselves from being a victim of fraud. “We urge anyone who believes they have been a fraud victim to visit ­actionfraud.police.uk and report the incident.” Canaries Holiday Villas, Greek Villa Escapes and Balearic Villa Escapes are hosted by the US organisation GoDaddy. Ben Butler, director of the Digital Crimes Unit at GoDaddy, said: “We communicate regularly with UK law enforcement on alleged fraud issues and have established processes in place for taking action against websites conducting illegal activity. Read More Brit holidaymakers scammed out of £7.2MILLION last year by online booking fraudsters “If anyone believes that they have been defrauded by the people operating these websites, they should contact law enforcement.” Balearic Villa Escapes said the Council of Spain had issued it with a rental licence and gave an address in a residential part of Ibiza. A TripAdvisor spokesman said: “We are currently conducting an investigation into the concerns raised about the alleged fake holiday rental sites. “While the forum posts in question had not met our guidelines and were removed from the site, given the unique circumstances, the ban on Mr Cooper’s account has now been lifted.” A Google spokesman was unavailable to comment on its pay-per-click arrangements. How to avoid these rip-offs Many people are gearing up for a summer holiday but it's important to be careful when booking online (stock photo) ■ Check the web address is legitimate and has not been altered by slight changes to a domain name, such as going from .co.uk to .org ■ Do a thorough online search to check the company’s credentials. If a company is defrauding there is a good chance victims will post details of their experiences. ■ Look for the logo – check whether the company is a member of a recognised trade body such as the Association of British Travel Agents. You can verify membership at www.abta.com ■ Never pay directly into a private individual’s bank account. Paying by direct bank transfer is like paying by cash – the money is very difficult to trace and not refundable. Wherever possible, pay by credit or debit card. ■ Check paperwork. You should study receipts, invoices and terms and conditions. Be wary of any companies that don’t provide any at all. When booking through a holiday club or timeshare, have the contract thoroughly vetted by a solicitor before signing up. ■ Trust your instincts. If something sounds too good to be true, it probably is. ■ Report it. Victims should contact Action Fraud via www.actionfraud.police.uk Like us on Facebook Follow us on Twitter Money Newsletter Follow @MirrorMoney Subscribe to our Money newsletterEnter emailSubscribe More On Tripadvisor Villa Plus ABTA Holidays Money all Most Read Most Recent Mother’s DayHappy Mother's Day 2017!

Digital Trends Home > Mobile > Here's everything we expect to see at Google… Here's everything we expect to see at Google I/O 2017 — and how you can watch it By Kyle Wiggers — Updated May 13, 2017 5:20 pm Subscribe Share Google Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: Google has numerous events throughout the year, but I/O — an acronym for the computing phrase “input/output” — is by far the biggest. It’s a three-day affair of keynote presentations, developer workshops, and product announcements, and it’s where Google has unveiled a range of innovations, including Project Jacquard, Google Home, and Daydream. We’re expecting Google I/O 2017 to be no less newsworthy. The festivities at the Shoreline Amphitheater in Mountain View, California don’t begin until May 17 at 10 a.m. PT — the day and time of the conference’s first keynote address — but rumors have already begun to circulate about what Google has up its sleeve. Here’s how to watch the conference, and what to expect. How to watch Google I/O Can’t make it to I/O? Not to worry — Digital Trends will have boots on the ground covering I/O. If you want to stream video directly from the show floor, Google has made it easy. Like last year, the official I/O website and corresponding app (iOS, Android) offer an interactive schedule that allows you to keep track of upcoming developer sessions — you can add sessions you’re interested in straight to your Google Calendar to get notifications before they start. The sessions with the black video camera icon mean they will be available for live-streaming on YouTube via the Google Developers channel. What to expect at Google I/O Android O In the past, Google has teased forthcoming iterations of Android, its smartphone operating system, at I/O, and this year’s conference won’t be an exception. Android O, the successor to Android 7.1.2 Nougat, launched quietly in March as an unfinished, buggy Developer Preview. We’re expecting new developments at this year’s conference. Specifically, we’re likely to hear more about Android O’s revamped notification system, which lets you snooze alerts and schedule them to reappear at a later time, and Notification Channels, which allow developers to aggregate multiple notifications into a single bundle. Google will also likely talk about Android O’s battery life management,which puts strict limits on apps running in the background, and the company could spend time detailing Android O’s high-quality Bluetooth audio capabilities. At the very least, we wouldn’t be surprised to see a second, more polished Android O Developer Preview for Nexus (Nexus 5X, Nexus 6P, and Nexus Player) and Pixel (Pixel and Pixel XL) devices. Google could announce an Android O update for the Android Beta program, which would make it easy for those interested to download onto supported devices. If we’re lucky, we might learn what “O” stands for, but that announcement usually comes later in the year. Fuchsia What is Fuchsia? It’s a mysterious new operating system, and we’re really hoping Google will spill the beans at I/O 2017. Fuchsia, also known as Armadillo, is a little different from Google’s other operating systems in that it’s not based on Linux. Instead, it’s built around a kernel called Magenta, which the company describes as “[coded for] modern phones and modern personal computers.” It sports a re-imagined user interface with a home screen that showcases your profile picture and the current day and time, along with a list of cards that show recent apps and Google Now-like contextual suggestions. It’s unclear if Fuchsia’s meant to be an alternative to Android. Hopefully, I/O 2017 will bring answers. Andromeda and Chrome OS At I/O 2016, Google announced that Android apps were coming to select Chromebooks. Some reports — including one from the Wall Street Journal in 2016 — suggested it was a harbinger of tighter integration between the two operating systems to come. At I/O 2017, we’ll see once and for all if that’s true. Late last year, reports suggested that at least two major hardware manufacturers were in the process of creating devices that would run Andromeda, the code name of a unified OS made from bits and pieces of Android and Chrome OS. The hardware is rumored to launch in the second half of 2017. More recent leaks point to a bigger event later this year, potentially headlined by Android O, a Huawei-made tablet, and a long-rumored successor to Google’s last Pixel-branded Chromebook. There have yet to be any official reports. Chromebooks, such as Samsung’s new Chromebook Plus and Chromebook Pro, can run Android apps — though the feature has been in beta for months with little improvement. Google may make an announcement regarding this at I/O 2017. Google Home Google Home, Google’s smart speaker, is flying off the shelves. Some analysts estimate that the company’s on track to sell a million units by the middle of 2017. It’s no surprise that Google is reportedly at work on a successor — and one it could announce at I/O 2017. Rumors suggest Google is looking to add mesh Wi-Fi networking features to Home — basically a combination of Google Wifi and Google Home. If true, the new Google Home will have to impress to beat back competition. Amazon’s forthcoming Echo Show speaker touts a touchscreen and a camera, allowing it to serve up news briefings from CNN, video-conferencing apps, and more. Apple is reportedly working on a smart home assistant, too — one powered by Siri — with a powerful speaker and support for HomeKit, its home automation platform. We wouldn’t be surprised to see a new Google Home announcement at I/O 2017, considering Google unveiled the first iteration of the device at last year’s conference. Don’t expect it to launch any time soon, though. Google Assistant Julian Chokkattu/Digital Trends The Google Assistant, Google’s umbrella brand for the virtual assistant on newer Android devices, Google Home, Android TV, and Android Wear, launched at I/O 2016. Back then, it could schedule reminders and pull up nearby movie showtimes, among other tasks. Thankfully, it’s gotten way better in the time since. Google has kept the Assistant up to date. In April, Google Home gained the ability to distinguish between up to six different voices, and more recently, a recipe feature that recommends dishes and guides you through the cooking process. Google Assistant on the Pixel also received an update to control smart home devices. We’re not expecting earth-shattering Google Assistant news from I/O 2017, but integrations with new services are pretty much a guarantee. Daydream There hasn’t been much news about Daydream, Google’s answer to Samsung’s Gear VR, since its launch last fall. The Daydream platform, which consists of the Daydream View headset and a motion controller, is available on select Android smartphones such as the Google Pixel, ZTE’s Axon 7, Asus’ Zenfone 3 Deluxe, and Lenovo’s Moto Z and Moto Z Force. There’s an augmented reality and virtual reality keynote on May 18, the second day of I/O, so it’s safe to say we can expect a lot of updates to the Daydream platform. There’s also a slim chance that Google could take the wraps off a new VR device at I/O 2017. Last year, the search giant was said to be developing a standalone VR headset that is “less powerful” than products such as the HTC Vive and Oculus Rift, but with the necessary chips, lenses, sensors, and motion-sensing cameras to deliver a self-contained VR experience. We’ll have to wait and see if the rumor pans out. Project Jacquard and ATAP Android, AI, VR, and TV may form the bulk of Google’s business, but some of the more interesting announcements come from its experimental pursuits from the Advanced Technology and Projects division. Project Jacquard, one of ATAP’s most impressive projects, is a capacitive platform for textiles. It can turn ordinary shirt sleeves into touch-sensitive surfaces, or pant legs into gesture-sensing shortcut buttons. Google partnered with Levi’s for Jacquard’s first implementation, the Commuter jacket, which has a touch-sensitive cuff strap (the Jacquard Tag). It performs actions on your smartphone when you swipe across it or tap it. It’s early, but we might hear about new Jacquard partners and apparel at I/O 2017. Project Soli, another ATAP project, is a tiny radar that detects hand gestures on smart clothing, smartwatches, and other devices. Google’s gotten it in the hands of about 60 developers so far, and shipped the first developer kits last year. So far, Soli tech has made its way to prototype smartwatches — Soli-equipped watches can adjust the volume when you move your hand closer and further away, and open messages with the flick of a finger — but we’ve yet to see any consumer devices hit the market. Here’s hoping that changes at I/O 2017. We also wouldn’t be surprised to see new experiments from ATAP as well. Android Wear Julian Chokkattu/Digital Trends It’s been almost three years since Google launched Android Wear, its smartwatch OS. Since then, Swiss watchmakers and electronics makers alike have adopted it earnestly — and aggressively. These days, it’s easy to find an Android Wear watch from LG, Fossil, Tag Heuer, Nixon, Polar, Michael Kors, New Balance, Huawei, and a host of other manufacturers. Earlier this year, Google launched a reimagined version of the OS — Android Wear 2.0 — following an unveiling at Google I/O 2016. It features a revamped, vertically-oriented user interface, watch face Complications (small sub dials that act as notification-centric widgets), the Google Assistant, and a Wear Google Play Store. Most of the year’s biggest Android Wear watch launches took place at Baselworld 2017, the luxury trade show in Switzerland, but there’s a chance Google might announce minor tweaks at I/O 2017. Allo and Duo Google announced two new communication apps, Allo and Duo, at Google I/O 2016. Allo, a text-based messenger that was the first to tap into the Google Assistant, has seen a steady stream of updates since. However, Allo still lacks a desktop app. In February, Googl’s Vice President of communications products, tweeted a screenshot of an in-development Allo web app, which we expect to hear more about at I/O 2017. Duo, a video messenger, hasn’t gotten as much attention, but it recently hit 50 million downloads on the Play Store. We could hear more about the Duo team’s connectivity efforts at I/O 2017. Chromecast and Android TV I/O 2017 may bring news about Chromecast, Google’s HDMI streaming dongle that turns your TV into a big-screen receiver. It was at I/O 2014, after all, that Google launched Backdrop, a Chromecast feature that lets you beam artwork and photos from a smartphone to a Chromecast. And the year before at I/O 2015, Google rolled out Chromecast tools aimed at game developers. Last fall, Google launched a 4K-enabled Chromecast — the Chromecast Ultra — which supports Ultra HD content and high dynamic range (HDR), a more colorful and high-contrast video encoding standard. Google has also been partnering with manufacturers to build the Google Cast technology into various devices. You can cast directly to speakers and TVs from Vizio, Sony, LG, Philips, Polk, and Bang and Olufsen, so far, with more OEMs joining the fray every year. We wouldn’t be surprised if Google announced new hardware partners at I/O 2017. Android TV hasn’t received as much attention from Google as, say Android Wear, but it’s gotten its fair share of updates. We’re not sure what to expect about the platform, but there could be a Google Assistant integration in the works — similar to what Amazon has done with the Fire TV Stick and Alexa. Project Loon Google’s Project Loon, which aims to bring internet to underdeveloped regions of the world with the help of transceiver-equipped hot air balloons, could get a mention or two at I/O 2017. Google’s engineers have managed impressive feats so far. Thanks to a self-powered, self-contained system of solar panels and a predictive weather model, Project Loon balloons can now remain airborne for 190 days. During a test in South Africa last year, the team sent a balloon from Puerto Rico to Peru — a trip it completed after 12 days and more than 20,000 altitude adjustments. We expect to hear more about Project Loon’s advancements — and plans for the future — at an I/O 2017 session next week. Android Auto Android Auto, Google’s infotainment platform for vehicles, could see fresh announcements. Not too long ago, the platform got an upgrade in the form of Android Auto 2.0, which added support for hands-free voice commands, improved apps, real-time traffic, and weather alerts. Last year, Hyundai brought Android Auto support to its Blue Link system, allowing drivers to use the Google Assistant to start their car, lock the doors, and carry out a slew of other useful actions. Kia recently deployed Android Auto as a free software update on cars spanning model years 2014 through 2017. Google said more than 200 new car models from 50 brands now support Android Auto. Expect that number to grow at I/O 2017. Project Tango and AR We could see more news about Google’s Project Tango, a self-contained augmented reality platform, at I/O 2017. The impressive software-sensor combo can track objects, walls, and table surfaces in three-dimensional space. The best Project Tango apps and games enable computer-generated characters to bounce on top of nearby tables, virtual drapes to draw closed over real-world windows, and digital dominoes to topple onto physical floorboards. But hardware partners haven’t been quick on the uptake. The first consumer-oriented Tango phone, Lenovo’s Tango-equipped Phab 2 Pro launched last year, and the Asus ZenFone AR Tango Phone, doesn’t have a release date. It’s been pretty quiet on the Tango front, but we’re hoping to hear more about Tango hardware — and related software — at I/O 2017.

Google Pixel long-term review: Still the best smartphone I've ever used David Ruddock Follow View All Posts 2017/05/02 3:28pm PDTMay 2, 2017 76 Plus 1 on G+ 342 Share on Facebook 126 Share on Twitter Total Shares544 News Phone Reviews Pixel Pixel XL Article Contents 1 The hardware 2 Battery life 3 Display, audio, and wireless 4 Camera 5 Performance and software 6 Value 7 Conclusion I have been using the Google Pixel XL for six months now. Not continuously, mind you - I have taken breaks here and there. But after using the Galaxy S8+, the LG G6, and the OnePlus 3T, there is only one phone I've instinctively found myself returning to, and it's this one. Google's Pixel isn't without its flaws; in fact, it has a great many I can cite with ease. The Bluetooth connectivity sucks. The back of the phone has very obvious wear rub. The glass window scratches easily. It's not waterproof. 'OK Google' hotword detection breaks for no apparent reason, necessitating a reboot. The fingerprint scanner is slower than what you'd find on a number of competitor devices. The value proposition is mediocre at best. The screen to body ratio pales in comparison to phones like the G6 or Galaxy S8. And you can't even buy the damn thing. Why do I keep picking up the Pixel time and time again, then? Am I just a brainwashed Google fanboy (don't answer that question)? The answer is consistency. In the nearly seven years I've been doing this, I have never used an Android phone that has held up so well to the tortures of time. The Pixel XL feels nearly as smooth as the day I began using it six months ago. Android glides along with best-in-class touch latency and a responsiveness that feels immediate (if not manic) and satisfying. It's not just performance, either. My battery life remains largely predictable, too, and largely very good. The camera continues to impress with its swift launches and ease of use, and it produces the most consistently excellent results of any smartphone camera I have ever used. HDR+ is easily, for me, the best smartphone camera feature out there. Oh, and even if the fingerprint scanner is a bit slow compared to some, at least the damn thing is easy to reach and reads consistently. Is the XL worth $770 to pick up today? I don't really think so, let alone $870 for the 128GB version we all actually want. And honestly, I have a hard time seeing the point of the smaller 5" model at $650 right now, that just feels like lunacy. The XL offers better battery life and is far from "big phone" status in terms of actual usability - it's really the only one of the two that warrants consideration, in my opinion. With that, let's dive in to the details. The hardware Put the Google Pixel XL next to a Galaxy S8+ and you'll have a pretty hard time finding much to love about Google's phone. 2017 is ushering in a new era of smartphone design language and packaging, and the Pixel XL clearly hails from the period prior to that shift. To be fair, it did come out six months ago. But there's no doubt that from an industrial design point of view, the Pixel is aging fairly rapidly. The 5.5" Pixel XL is nearly as tall as a Galaxy S8+, but the latter has a 6.2" display. Line up the bottom of the S8's screen with the Pixel XL's, and it becomes apparent just how much more panel Samsung has managed to shove into a frame that is only a few millimeters taller. Granted, this does have ergonomic consequences (the S8+ is unabashedly more difficult to use one-handed than the XL because of the screen's height), but I think it's safe to say most of us want more screen where we can get it. I still think the Pixel XL is perfectly nice to hold and like the texture of the aluminum opposed to Samsung and LG's new glass-heavy designs. I also still believe the fingerprint scanner is in the ideal location, unlike the Galaxy S8, which has the most frustrating one in existence. The position of the camera makes accidental smudging less likely, too, and I really like the perfectly flush look Google was able to achieve with the glass window. Visible wear lines on the casing In terms of wear and tear, my XL has... not fared well. The finish on the Quite black model I have here has begun to very noticeably rub off in areas where the aluminum chassis is slightly more raised than others. You could remedy this with a skin, but I personally like this phone totally unadorned. Otherwise, though, it's held up well - the buttons are still fine and I don't notice any real physical problems with the phone aside from the aforementioned finish wear. Just don't drop it in the toilet. Battery life As I said in the introduction, it's consistently good. I always have a pretty clear sense of how much time I've got left when I'm really starting to push my XL to the limits of its longevity. If I'm having a Wi-Fi heavy day with lots of using the phone for browsing the web and texting, 5 hours of screen-on time is doable. If I'm away from home and largely on LTE, I can pretty reliably get 4 hours of screen time assuming it's not stretched over much longer than a 12-hour period. For a full 16-hour day away from wall outlets and going it on mobile data alone, 3 hours is what I generally end up managing. This probably won't impress many of you with Xiaomi, Huawei, or Exynos-powered Samsung devices, and I understand that. But the thing about the Pixel has been just how well I've been able to learn what I can expect in terms of battery performance based on the conditions I'm using it in. I know I can throw in a bit of tethering and Bluetooth streaming without completely obliterating the battery, for example, if I'm at 60% halfway through my day and won't top up till later that evening. My range anxiety with the Pixel is exceptionally low, even if it doesn't offer the very best battery life of any smartphone. Would I like the next-generation Pixels to have larger batteries? Yes, please. Relying only on software to ensure a good power consumption experience is missing half the equation (and I'm not saying that's what Google did). Stuffing even a few-hundred more milliamp hours of capacity in there can be the difference between a dead phone and one that gets you back to the charger at the end of the night. Always fit a bigger battery when you can. Display, audio, and wireless The Super AMOLED Quad HD display still looks bright and crisp, even if the new panel on the S8 is clearly a cut above the part Google is using on the Pixel. Even so, I think the screen is one area where the Pixel XL earns its $770 keep, as there really aren't many phones out there you're going to find which are considerably better in this regard unless they have "Galaxy" inscribed on the back. On the audio front, I found the Pixel's bottom-firing speaker mediocre at the time I reviewed it, and I find it mediocre today. Sadly, it's not getting much in the way of competition, either - both the G6 and S8 have speakers that are at least as unimpressive, if not worse in certain respects, and I hope Google can at least give us that quasi-BoomSound using the earpiece speaker on the Pixel 2 this year. The headphone jack offers performance in line with most Snapdragon 820-series devices and thus isn't the best candidate for pushing your high-impedance cans, but I find it perfectly serviceable in the gym even at high outputs. The quality is there, even if this generation of Qualcomm parts didn't offer as much power as audiophiles probably would have liked. One of my biggest gripes about the XL is its Bluetooth performance. I have used three separate Pixel XLs, and all of them have absolutely terrible Bluetooth signal. Even think about touching the phone in the wrong spot, and the music stream to your headphones or car will cut out. It is absolutely obnoxious. It doesn't matter what kind of headphones, speaker, or car A/V unit - it sucks with anything I've tried. Even walking around with the Pixel XL in my pocket connected to a pair of Bluetooth headphones results in cuts every single time I step up a stair or rest my hand against the pocket the phone is in. The 7.1.2 patch has done nothing to alleviate this issue. It's borderline embarrassing: I have had the Pixel XL corrupt the Bluetooth profiles on my car three times. Each time, the only solution was to factory reset the infotainment unit. I had to factory reset my car. No other phone has ever done this to me, though since the 7.1.2 update this hasn't happened - yet. Wi-Fi performance, on the other hand, has been quite excellent for me, and LTE signal is at least as good as most other phones I tested in 2016. Now that I'm on Verizon, I'm even getting some HD voice calls, which is such a huge upgrade in terms of the call experience. But seriously, Google: get the damn Bluetooth right next time. Camera I can't stop taking pictures with the Pixel. I love this camera. No more words: just photos.     Performance and software Aside from the aforementioned Bluetooth problems, you know what I find so wonderful about the Pixel? I rarely really get annoyed using it. Apps load up at consistently quick speeds, the OS always feels snappy and responsive, and the touch latency is positively iPhone-y. Like your finger is truly controlling the elements on the screen. The home button and back key respond lightning-quick, in a way that almost starts to make them feel like real buttons. I struggle to really convey how right Google got the basic "interacting with the phone" stuff here. What they managed to do with the Pixel will only make the Pixel 2 that much better a phone, and I will be clear: I do not feel this way about the Galaxy S8. The Pixel feels incredibly natural and pleasant to interact with. There are still hiccups, delays, and little areas where things just don't feel as smooth and seamless as they should on the S8. Google nailed this. No other phone I've used has. Is the Pixel as fast in a straight-line speed sense as a OnePlus 3T? No. But counting fractional differences between the number of seconds it takes to load an app or how long before it's pushed out of memory are not methods that convey an experience. They tell you a couple of very specific things under a controlled circumstance. In practice, I simply find the Pixel the most consistent and smooth Android smartphone I've ever used. But, it does have some usability issues. For one, my 'OK Google' hotword detection breaks basically once a week, necessitating a reboot. I use this when in the car, and so it's very, very inconvenient when this happens. Rebooting the phone takes a good minute-plus, and then it has to reconnect to my Bluetooth (which is never guaranteed to work). This is probably something to do with the Google app, but it's annoying nonetheless. Other than that? I struggle to find anything about the software that I really dislike. Most of my frustrations come down to third-party apps, not the Pixel. And those are annoying on any phone I use. Value When it debuted in October, the Google Pixel XL cost $770. The one you and I actually want, the 128GB model, cost $870. Six months later, the Pixel XL still costs $870. Is it worth it? Hah. No. The successor devices to the current Pixel family will be unveiled in the next five or six months. There is absolutely no good reason to shell out what, with tax, amounts to nearly a thousand dollars for this smartphone. You will absolutely regret it the moment Google announces the Pixel 2 - I guarantee you. Do not buy a Pixel right now. In fact, I'd say just don't buy a Pixel period anymore, we're just too close to the next iteration for that to be remotely sane advice. Conclusion So, that's weird, right? I can't even recommend that you buy what is easily my favorite Android smartphone currently on the market? What kind of long-term endorsement is that? That's because for all its problems and limited availability, the last six months I've used the Pixel have utterly proven to me that Google is capable of building a smartphone that, from a user experience standpoint, rises above the competition. Google's unmatched ability to optimize the way Android and the underlying phone parts interact is very much a reason I love this phone so much. A smartphone should get out of its own way when you use it - it should be an effortless canvas upon which your fingers and eyes naturally engage and interact. That means it should be fast. It should be consistent. And it should just feel right to use. I know that some of these things don't really translate well into concrete assessments, but there's something about the Pixel that really just works for me so well. It's as close to my ideal smartphone as I've ever been. I'm hoping that Google smoothes over some of the rough edges not just with the phone, but with the whole experience of buying and owning it. Why is is to hard to buy a Pixel? It's positively ridiculous just how bad Google has been at keeping this phone in stock. I also think it's hard to ignore that in 2017, the Pixel's design language and overall look and feel are clearly behind the competition. This looks like yesterday's smartphone, and even on the day it was announced it was kind of hard to really fall in love with in an aesthetic sense. At best, it's just kind of boring. Post-purchase experiences should improve, too. Google's online and live chat support are very-just-OK, and what I've heard of the RMA process hasn't been super reassuring - full price credit card holds and iffy-quality refurbished replacements. Of course, that's what happens when you're in the online-only phone sales business. Still, Google should be working to streamline defect, warranty, and accidental damage claims in a way that makes it feel like the nearly-thousand dollars you spent on your phone is going into supporting a thousands-dollar-phone experience. They really also need to stop making crappy cases that are obscenely overpriced. Google made a great phone when it built the Pixel. Now Google needs to be a great phone company. I'm curious to see if they can pull it off. Tags google pixel long term review google pixel review pixel long term review pixel xl long term review subscribe ...

I shouldn't buy the best phone you've ever used. David, you are hurting my brain! David Ruddock you really shouldn't though Jeff Beck Well, Pixel 2, hurry up and get here then. My 6P is losing longevity and running super slow these days. Just can't bring myself to overlook the Samsung FP scanner or I might have settled for an S8. Tr3ple I'm warming you don't do it. I settled for a s7 edge after my 6p, big mistake OhYeah! I made that mistake with the Galaxy S3 and then the Edge 6. Both were disappointing and much worse than my Pixel XL. I love the Pixel! Dean L I got used to my S8+ fingerprint scanner after about a week. I absolutely love the position now, and never touch the camera anymore. Carson Saldanha Throw in free banana splits and you've got a deal! ;) Rickinbsb pick 2 Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ "My 6P is losing longevity and running super slow these days." I see people say all the time that it's Samsung phones that always get slow over time. Intellectually dishonest people, I guess. sweenish They can both be right, you know. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yes, I believe they're both right, depending on various factors. My Note 4 is running better than it did with Lollipop, and a little slower than it did with KitKat. It probably has at least something to do with the Android version and what apps you install on it. My point was that it's intellectually dishonest to pretend it's a Samsung problem, as if it's unique to those phones. And that's how the people frame the problem. sweenish And you were just framing it as "not us, but them." Not better. If I misread your intent, I apologize. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ You did misread my intent. No problem, though. Treeburgerface It's Android that's the problem. Some Android phones get slower than others. Some Android phones lag more than others. But eventually they ALL get slower and they ALL lag. I've heard 1000 people swear that Android is "silky smooth" and "fixed" now over and over again, before "project butter" and long after and it's still not true. It's certainly improved, which you should expect with the 3 Ghz 12 core processors and 8 GB of RAM they are packing in them now, but at this point I kind of doubt Android is ever going to be quite as flawless in the GUI department as other OS's which were designed to prioritize touch input and treat the users finger like God they way they should and which prioritize reliability over ultimate capability. Just depends which set of sacrifices you are more comfortable with. Ismail Akram Well that totally sum up a perfect phone for me :) Just add Powerful AMP in that Ghisy This, times a million! And also a cheaper, not overpriced XL with at least a 5.7" screen. Then Google can have my money. Meanwhile, I'll be keeping my Nexus 6P. Rod "My 6P is losing longevity and running super slow these days" I don't get this. How is it running super slow all of a sudden? Did you fry half of your board or something? My 3 year old phone performs exactly the same way as when I first unboxed it. Try running in safe mode, because there's probably a rogue app in your end.

Stock Android is always buttery smooth. Even when it isn't. Louis Smith I'm in the same boat. Sold my OP3, Loved the phone, but someone else wanted it. I just kept on going back to my N6P.

Sean Opinion: Even if you can, you probably shouldn't buy a Google Pixel anymore............. David Martrano I'll take my edge over the pixal Any day. I've never had the loss of a Bluetooth connection. Plus there always backordered. I tried to purchase back in December and Google told me I had a 60 day wait. I said OK and moved on. When you lose consumers to me that's not good business! Either have them in stock or lose money! senor_heisenberg It's a Google product, so I'm not even surprised. Just a weird company. ericshmerick Yesterday: don't buy this POS Today: I love this phone lulz Daishi And in both articles he said not to buy the phone. It is advice. He explained himself quite well with several caveats. His point is valid. There is no real reason anyone should buy this 6 month old phone for its introductory price, even if the phone had no flaws. Bob Thank you. Rod You should. However, you'll need to time travel back to the launch day. Tr3ple Incoming triggered Sammy fanboys.... OligarchyAmbulance "WUT?!?! What do you mean your Samsung lags? Mines *never* lagged! It runs as well as the day I bought it, you *obviously* have a defective unit!" username_not_valid I feel the need to factory rest a device several times a year anyway, Samsung or not. David Martrano Totally agree, my edge has never lagged. Purchased over a yr ago. Just as fast as the day I bought it. Plus with the Nouget update even better! deadpenguins My fiance's gs7 is less than a year old, yet it *constantly* lags and hangs up. She has to restart it at least once every few days and has to charge it twice a day even though she barely uses it! See how useful anecdotes are? OligarchyAmbulance Woosh Jermell Howard Jr Lol funny and true but lets be hone st Google in the Smartphone world is like France and Samsung is like the U.S. Jeff Beck I'm not sure who that comparison favors. Jermell Howard Jr The U.S is a world superpower and France is not. Samsung is much bigger in terms phone market share Winston But Samsung doesn't have a loud CEO who tweets in all caps during his morning bowel movement. Jermell Howard Jr 😂 ok? King_Android 😂😂😂 xyz Yeah, they just have a better education and healthcare system, and higher quality of life statistics. But America does have a lot of big, shiny bombs. I'll give you that. Marty Nah, still not biting. Me no like HTC. "I have a hard time seeing the point of the smaller 5" model at $650 right now, that just feels like lunacy." I'm one who prefers a smaller phone. Had Apple included an FHD display on the 4.7" iPhone 7, I'd be sporting one with a Cheshire Cat grin. RyRyTheFunBun I think that Apple did the right thing by sticking with just an HD display on the 4.7. Good density with less of hit on battery. But if they wanted to make the phone thicker.. rockon999 I just bought one. Honestly David, 6 months is a long time to wait to buy a new device (Pixel 2). My Moto X is done for and I wanted a good phone. What can I say. At least I don't use Bluetooth and don't mind cases... Paladin27 I just bought one... 4 weeks ago and got it yesterday. Great timing on these two articles, AP. :-/ BUT, My Nexus 6 is dying and I needed something new. I weighed the options, my wife even has a G6, but I'm glad I got the Pixel XL, and besides, it will be 8 months before anyone actually has a Pixel 2 in their hands. whispy_snippet I wouldn't worry at all. Both of you. You got what in my book is still the best phone you can get. Not the best in every single way, but the best in the ways that are arguably the most important. JDC Great article @rdr0b11:disqus. Fair and balanced. I feel the same way about my Pixel. I also have the fun time of explaining to friends and family why my Pixel is the best Android phone I've used BUT they shouldn't buy one. I personally can't wait to see what improvements are made to the Pixel 2. mwolverine I have an OP3T, and one thing i don't get is how is the user experience on the pixel superior? Both are running nearly stock Android and are very consistent. Tr3ple You'd be surprised how much better the Bexel XL actually is compared to the 3t. Granted the 3t is the best bang for the buck out there. Duder12 It's more fluid and smooth. What don't you understand? Ismail Akram Have you used Pixel for yourself for month or for a week? I had OP3(not T) and came to Pixel XL. One thing very obvious to me when switching was smoothness between the two. Pixel animations feels more natural. and scrolling feels so smoother, its not massive difference and normal users can't even tell the difference, until he have used so many phones. then Software update thing is really awesome on Pixel. Camera is best for me on Pixel. Display is also great. In term of looks I prefer OP3 more. well IMO if Pixel have better design it would be even better for me. BTW I hear people have a lot of issues with OP3T touch latency which OnePlus improved but not gone. people don't even notice these latency things until they use phone with less touch latency. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Given that you admitted many (but not all) of it's faults, if that's the best phone you've ever used, you've set the bar incredibly low. crackcaffeine You sound like you know a lot about this topic. What is the best phone you've ever owned? Inb4 Note 7 Grahaman27 "It's the best smartphone ever but don't buy it!" Which half of this is bullshit? Jarrett Lennon Kaufman Neither, if you read and understand the context. Grahaman27 A new phone probably launching in 6 months (that we know nothing about) is not a valid reason to not recommend buying a phone. Tr3ple It's an opinion you know? Jarrett Lennon Kaufman If that were the only reason he stated in the article, I might agree with you. Again, read and understand the context. MJ Did you consider reading the article and trying to understand the words? David Martrano That's like saying do as I say don't do as I do! Suicide_Note I'm just grateful i haven't experienced any issues with the Bluetooth on my XL. Keith Stefanec Me neither. Sean Me either CF542 You guys are lucky. I'm on my second Pixel and still have Bluetooth issues. Not as bad as the first unit but still a problem. Love the phones​ though Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I frequently see comments by people who say they're on their 3rd or 4th Pixel. It makes me wonder how many of those 2.1 million Pixels HTC shipped are replacement phones. David Martrano When the day comes when they sell 50 million pixals, please let me know. It's a great phone for a limited audience! Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ "Limited audience" -- I couldn't have described its fans better than that. Tom Takumi Okamoto Google should buy OnePlus to improve them as a phone maker. NexusKoolaid How did that work out for Motorola? Tom Takumi Okamoto Not well. I don't think Google wanted to be a phone maker at that time because the Nexus program was still on. If I'm not mistakin it acquired Motorola just to protect Android from lawsuits. Knowledgeborn Allah The entire basis of your argument kind of falls apart when you admit that you can't recommend for anybody to buy it, and I think that's because of the Pixel's main problem: it's overpriced, underpowered, and unsustainable on Android's current platform. The fact that it'll be DOA by 2019 just makes it worse. Could I recommend that people buy the Pixel XL right now (if they could get their hands on one anyway)? Nope. Could I recommend that OnePlus 3T? Yes, definitely! The S7 Edge, which is OLDER than the Pixel? Yes! There was even an article I read today with reviewers STILL recommending people to buy the iPhone 6s Plus to save money, and that device came out 2 years ago! When compared to those devices, the Pixel just doesn't hold up, which is why I don't think anybody would recommend it today, only 6 months after its release. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ They expected to sell 3 million by the end of 2016 and 7 million more in 2017. HTC has shipped about 2 million since it was released over 6 months ago. 'nuff said. whispy_snippet Can you provide references for these assertions? OligarchyAmbulance The reference would likely be his anus. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Google "htc shipped 2.1 million pixels". For comparison purposes, Sony shipped a total of 5.1 million Xperia phones in Q4 2016. And that was a drop of 33% year over year. whispy_snippet That's not a reference. That's some words inside double inverted commas. Tr3ple https://www.google.com/amp/m.gsmarena.com/google_has_already_sold_21_million_pixels_report_says-amp-24270.php whispy_snippet Thanks for this. But it only states the amount of Pixels sold, being 2.1 million. I haven't seen a reference where Google officially states "they expected to sell 3 million by the end of 2016 and 7 million more in 2017." A statement like this sounds like horse shit to me. There's no way Google would be foolish enough to make a specific target like this available to the public. In other words, Felonious Monk is almost certainly bull shitting. Again. Tr3ple He wasn't bullshitng lol http://www.digitimes.com/news/a20161006VL200.html whispy_snippet "Sorry, the page you are trying to open is available only for our paid subscribers." Tr3ple pocketnow.com/2016/10/06/google-pixel-smartphones-4-million-sales-forecast whispy_snippet Are you even reading the articles you're referencing? Once again, nowhere does it say Google "expected to sell 3 million by the end of 2016 and 7 million more in 2017." He's bull shitting because that's what a bull shitter does. Tr3ple Google never said that, that's your boy up there paraphrasing. Either way they predicted the phone to sell quite a lot. And it is. whispy_snippet He's not paraphrasing. He's manipulating information, being deliberately misleading, and bull shitting. Completely. Tr3ple "Digitimes Research's Taiwan Mobile Device Tracker - HTC's handset shipments are expected to reach 6.5-7 million units in the second half of the year, up less than 10% from 5.8-6.1 million units in the first half." whispy_snippet So is the digitimes research device tracker establishing projected figures based off their own analysis or from direct statements from Google and/or HTC? OligarchyAmbulance So you know how many phones Google expected to ship because you made it up and it's now a fact? lol Alright, buddy. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Android Authority: "Report: Pixel shipments could hit 4 million this year" (2016) "Morgan Stanley: Google on track to sell 3 million Pixel devices in 2016, 5-6 million next year" Google it for yourself. Randy Gindy Googled. Found several sites that reported Pixel sales already being 2.5 million. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Cool. No sources, but I'll trust you. Maybe by the end of 2017 they'll hit the projected sales target for the end of 2016. Randy Gindy Where were your sources? Randy Gindy Xperia is a pretty well known brand already in several markets. The Pixel brand hasn't had much exposure aside from the couple models of developer oriented Chromebooks and Tablet. I wouldn't assert that because an established brand sells better than a brand that just really started that it makes it a bad phone. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Xperia is a great example of a failing phone in the US, at least, which is why I used it as a comparison. "You may as well pretend Sony doesn’t exist in the U.S" https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/why-sonys-xperia-phones-keep-failing-in-the-us/ Randy Gindy It maybe a failing brand but it is established. Tr3ple Just shut it, ill recommend a pixel over all these phones you mentioned, s7 egde won't get anroid P, I can guarantee you that. Until you've owned and used a pixel XL you shouldn't comment on it. tim242 It is HTC trash. Tr3ple Yeah we get it, you don't own one. tim242 Why would I? Hardware issues galore. Not to mention, the stock problem. Tr3ple Lol as i thought, move along. tim242 Deflect much? It is well documented trash. Tr3ple Hahahahahaha, like I said move along tim242 You can't deny it, so you deflect. You must be a trump worshiper. Jeff Beck Well, that escalated quickly. Richard Dennis Yea... yea.. we know you're here you're queer get used to it.. Next! Safe circles, safety pins, and pink hats for everyone.. (Paid for by the government of course) tim242 Damn str8! Knowledgeborn Allah Fanboyism at its finest... The Pixel is not a good buy compared to any of those phones, and I DO have the Pixel XL. I know from experience that it's overpriced, underpowered, and unsustainable with Android's current system. 🤦🏾‍♂️ The S7 Edge probably won't get Android P... And? Based on the chart just released (scroll up), most other Android devices probably won't get Android P either, at least not until "Android R" is out. Lol! Tr3ple Judging by what you said I doubt you have a Pixel XL. Yes it's overpriced, just a lil. If somebody don't care about the price, yes pixel is definitely a better buy Knowledgeborn Allah What kind of sense does that make? It's a "better buy" if you don't care about the price? 😳 Like I said, it's overpriced for what it is. Tr3ple yes plenty of us don't care about the price, it makes plenty of sense. Pfft Knowledgeborn Allah The idea of being a "better buy" contextually includes the price. The fact that the Pixel is overpriced for what it is automatically means it's not a good buy. And again, that's coming from somebody who bought the XL variant at launch. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ The OP3T and Axon 7 are much better buys. Knowledgeborn Allah Absolutely! Tr3ple No, the idea of "better buy" is a combination of EVERYTHING. Software, camera, build quality, reliability etc.. and let me tell you that the pixel is in fact t the better buy, only phone on that list I think MAYBE might be a better buy is the 3T, but the camera and battery life are ok not great, but for the money yes. Knowledgeborn Allah Yes, everything, INCLUDING the price. Again, the fact that it's overpriced means, contextually, that it's not a good buy. This shouldn't be that hard to understand. whispy_snippet I don't think it's over priced at all. Knowledgeborn Allah You don't think it's overpriced, being identical in price to the iPhone? I've heard other people make that claim, and yet they believe that the iPhone is overpriced... What's your view regarding this? Do you think the iPhone is overpriced? What does something being overpriced mean to you? whispy_snippet I guess I should rephrase. It's not over priced when compared to what it's competing with. "Over priced" is a bit of a relative term. It doesn't hold a lot of meaning. What is over priced to one person might be a steal for another. I think you can make the argument that compared to other phones the Pixel, iPhone and Galaxy S8 are all expensive. But over priced? That's a murkier discussion. Knowledgeborn Allah I agree, but I think status plays a role in pricing when it comes to other manufacturers. Samsung and Apple both have established brands, and people are willing to pay top dollar for their devices because they've already proven themselves. Google isn't in this same position in the smartphone hardware department. Also, I'd say that both lines - e.g. Galaxy S series and iPhone - offer much more in the way of unique features and premium hardware than what Google offers with the Pixel. But that's just my personal perspective... whispy_snippet See that's where I'm not so sure. The Pixel still has the best camera of any smartphone and an amazing display to back it up. Straight away it's hit two areas out of the park that matter to most people. At launch it had a class leading SoC that continues to offer great performance. It has plenty of RAM. Rock solid build quality. A super fast and accurate fingerprint sensor. USB-C (remember the GS7 didn't which was Samsung's 2017 flagship) with fast-charging and excellent battery life. It has the most capable voice assistant. It's got the latest version of Android and what I believe to be the best overall user experience for most people - it's consistently fast and smooth, unlike anything from Samsung, and will receive timely updates for much longer than the competition. The Pixel is the iPhone of the Android world and I think it has a market to fill. Do I think the Pixel 2 needs to be better? You bet. No one is denying this. What phone doesn't need to be better than its predecessor? If the Pixel 2 doesn't at least have waterproofing and a higher display-to-bezel ratio critics will hold them to account. But I'm pretty sure these features are a guarantee. The thing is, and I've said this elsewhere, I don't really consider a lot of the hardware bells and whistles we see from the likes of Samsung all that meaningful. The curved display is a gimmick. It looks great, but I'm not at all sold from a functional perspective. The same with the new 18:9 ratio. For a mobile device I consider one handed usability important. Reaching the notification pull-down with one hand is already a no-go on the GS8 and its fingerprint sensor is another ergonomic mis-step. And a heart rate sensor? Who on earth uses this? Same goes with its iris-scanner and face recognition. Why use these options when a well positioned fingerprint sensor is more convenient? It's all just guff. Bullet points for carrier salespeople to sing about in store. I think waterproofing is a biggie though. Google can't drop the ball here. I also think wireless charging is going to become significant if Apple introduces it to their new iPhone. We've seen Google offer wireless charging in the past and then take it away because, well, I don't think that many people really cared. But I sense the tide is going to turn on this. Google's phone is priced the same as the iPhone and Galaxy S because it's being positioned as a premium product. I hate the word "premium". It's huge BS when you really think about it. But ultimately this is the strategy Google is taking with its new phone. A high margin, high performing, premium flagship for the masses. I think the best of the Pixel line is yet to come. Knowledgeborn Allah I also think the Pixel launched with a lot of good qualities and features, and that's why I rushed to purchase it. However, around the same time, I bought an iPhone 7+, just to give iOS a fair shot. Now that I've used both devices, I think it's a huge mistake to call the Pixel "the iPhone of the Android world". In reality, it doesn't even come close, and that's where the problem comes in. The iPhone is Apple's primary device when it comes to sales, but it can almost be seen as an accessory to other Apple devices, like the Mac and the iPad, etc. The Apple ecosystem allows all their devices to work together seamlessly through Continuity, and this is something Android can't replicate (at least not at this point in time). The Pixel may look similar to an iPhone, but it definitely doesn't function like one. And yes, I know that Samsung (and carriers) puts a bunch of bloat on their devices, showing off features that many people will never use. The difference, though, is all about opportunity and selection. Samsung built an entire brand around giving their consumers more than they'll ever ask for, and that's what keeps those customers coming back. I don't know anybody who uses that heart-rate sensor on the back. When I see it, I think, "Why wouldn't they remove that and use the idea of the heart-rate monitor to sell more Galaxy Gear smartwatches?" I just didn't get it... But, hypothetically, if somebody ever ends up in a situation where they need a heart-rate monitor, Samsung has them covered. I learned that firsthand when my nephew was taken to his school nurse due to an asthma attack, and the nurse didn't have a heart-rate monitor in her office. Her assistant pulled out his Galaxy S7 Edge and used the heart-rate monitor on there to relay it to medical services when they arrived. I know, that would be a generally rare occurrence, but it happens from time to time, enough for people to consider what would happen if they didn't have it. Personally, I don't think Google has enough "skin in the game" at this point to really charge that much for the Pixel. Apple and Samsung have proven brands in the smartphone space. Tech reviewers giving it high marks isn't going to matter too much among average consumers, because most people just aren't interested in technology to that extent. They just want something that works, and works reliably. Google hasn't demonstrated the ability to make hardware that just works reliably (unless you count the Chromebook Pixel line, which most people didn't buy either). It's always better to start at the bottom and work your way up, than to start at the top and get knocked all the way down. Sean Everyone on here KNOWS you dont have a Pixel or a Pixel XL......but troll on......... Knowledgeborn Allah "Everyone on here" knows what I have? Seriously? You're an idiot. 💩 Knowledgeborn Allah I find it quite funny that anybody who criticizes the Pixel is automatically labeled a troll, a hater, a sheep, etc. How ridiculous! ¯_(ツ)_/¯ Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ After Marshmallow, I stopped caring about new Android versions. I'm almost afraid to get a Nougat phone, given there have been so many problems with it. As for O and P, I'll let you Pixel users alpha test it and then decide if I care about getting it. Knowledgeborn Allah 😂😂😂 I actually bought the Pixel XL mostly because I've had every Nexus device since the Nexus 4. I thought it would be a great device, but I was disappointed. It's not horrible, but it's definitely not worth the price. And, to be honest, I haven't really used it consistently in months. I use it occasionally to access the Google Play Store, but that's about it. My primary device nowadays is an iPhone 7+, and it's miles ahead of the Pixel XL in almost every way. Alex Louderback "DOA by 2019" is a contradiction, my friend. Knowledgeborn Allah If we're talking about release timeframe, you're right. But there's a big difference between when a device is released and when it's in the hands of the consumer. Last time I checked, the Pixel XL variants are still out of stock, even though nobody's buying them. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman DOA means "dead on arrival," which was Alex's point. It can't be DOA by years from now. Knowledgeborn Allah That's cool and all, but that's not a counter argument... OK, maybe "DOA" wasn't the best terminology, but the points still stand. The device, today, 6 months after its release, is still too flawed to recommend. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman Stop comparing it to an iPhone. No other Android phone should be purchased six months after its release either. Only iPhones have that status because they have no competition within themselves. Within Android, after six months, there's another king of the hill. But I wouldn't recommend a Galaxy six months after its release, or ANY other model of Android phone. Knowledgeborn Allah "Stop comparing it to an iPhone"? 😳 Google released the Pixel devices to directly compete with the iPhone! If they can't do that, then why are they matching it in price? If the product is devalued already, then Google needs to drop the price. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Put a fake button on the huge chin and it would look exactly like an iPhone. That's no accident. Sean You and Knowledgeborn Allah should have a troll off competition.......... Jarrett Lennon Kaufman Because your point has NOTHING to do with the Pixel, and EVERYTHING to do with Android as a whole. The reason the Pixel's not a good value proposition at this point is because it's competing against all other Android phones, which together are competing against the ONLY iPhone. You can't compare them in this regard. Period. Also, there's no point in comparing them because if I wanted an iPhone I'd own an iPhone. I don't. In which case I'm determining the best Android option. Right now, someone who isn't buying an iPhone, shouldn't buy a Pixel. That has nothing to do with the iPhone and everything to do with the competition in its own space. Knowledgeborn Allah That's not true. Every Android device isn't designed to directly compete with the iPhone, but that's exactly what Google tried to do with the Pixel. So, yes, they can definitely be compared. Just because the Pixel doesn't stack up doesn't mean that it shouldn't be compared. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman Android, as a whole, is designed to compete with the iPhone. While the Pixel has to compete with both the iPhone AND all of Android. "Just because the Pixel doesn't stack up doesn't mean that it shouldn't be compared." You're not reading or comprehending my words if THAT was your takeaway from what I said. Not bothering anymore. Knowledgeborn Allah Android as a whole? Android is an operating system. Its rival is iOS. You're positioning the platform as if it's completely one-sided. The iPhone has to compete with various Android devices too. It just happens to have an ecosystem of hardware to aid it along the way. You're acting like an Android OEM can't do the same thing if they put in time and resources. Based on the fact that Android manufacturers are only pushing out hardware components for smartphones (and occasionally tablets and smartwatches), I'd say their biggest competitors are other Android OEMs, not Apple and iOS. For the record, the LG G6 wasn't designed to compete with the iPhone. It's competing with the Galaxy S8. The HTC 10 was competing with the G5 and S7. It's never been an Android vs "Apple ecosystem" thing on the manufacturing level. The only OEMs who actively try to compete with the iPhone are Samsung (S and Note lines) and Google (Pixel line), and it looks like Huawei is just starting to build up their consumer base in the West to do that too. The others are generally competing against other Android OEMs. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman Your first paragraph made my entire point for me: Android manufacturers', including Google, biggest competitors are one another, *not* Apple and iOS. But ANDROID's biggest competitor is iOS, which has only ONE device line: the iPhone. The Google Pixel, while it may have been designed as Google's attempt to battle the iPhone, doesn't exist in a vacuum. It's still ALSO doing everything from the first paragraph: competing against all other Android manufacturers. No matter how much Google may *want* to break out of that, their wants are irrelevant to reality. And the reality is that the Pixel is one of many Android phones, all of whom are competing against one another, the sea of which is competing against the iPhone. So how well the Pixel stacks up against the iPhone isn't relevant, as it's not the focus of this article or the reasons for David's position. WITHIN the Android ecosystem, it's simultaneously the best Android phone he's ever used (same here) and not a good idea to buy it right now BECAUSE OF THE REST OF ANDROID and NOT for any reason having anything to do with the iPhone. For anyone who wants to buy an iPhone, which is a massive number of people, there is absolutely no competition, allowing them to charge anything they want. For anyone who wants Android, there's an endless sea of competition, making the Pixel's price and specs within the refresh cycle a much harder sell right now. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ The headline is, "Google Pixel long-term review: Still the best smartphone I've ever used" not the best Android phone. I assume he meant Android phone, though. Still all smartphones compete with one another. And if the Note 8 is disappointing, I'll definitely consider getting an iPhone 8. Because the best smartphone (for what I want and need) is what matters to me, not the best Android phone or even the best (insert OEM here) phone. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman Cool. We have different priorities, which is fine. I couldn't use an iPhone. Apple products and their ecosystem don't fit my needs. So I'm looking at *only* Android phones. So it's entirely a matter, at any one time, of what the best *Android* phone is. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I thought I couldn't use an iPhone, too. But I've used an iPhone 6S Plus now, and it's really quite a good phone. Even the display is better than I thought it would be. And that's quite a compliment coming from someone (me) who will never use anything but AMOLED. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman I have to use them for my clients sometimes. They're fine. They work well. I'm still too embedded in Google's ecosystem in ways that don't make switching feasible. Knowledgeborn Allah I get your point... I still think there are certain ways around that, especially considering Google's vast amount of resources. But yes, I see how that could definitely be a problem. They could still salvage the Pixel line, though, by providing standout features like Samsung does, or by undercutting their competition with their pricing like OnePlus does. I think either of those could work fairly well. The notion of putting standout features in their devices could be a challenge, since their devices pretty much serve as a template for Android as a whole. Undercutting the competition would be easier, and that's what Google actually did for years with the Nexus program. I think that's the big "bust" factor for them. If the Pixel could be purchased for $450-500, it would still be a good purchase even now, just like the OnePlus 3T. But it's really hard to justify paying $800 for the Pixel while the Galaxy S8 and G6 are on the scene. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman They already went for standout features. They made a big push to be more "opinionated" with several software and UI customizations, along with their big hardware push. The difference is a huge number of the Galaxy standout features just aren't that compelling. That's the sort of stuff they skipped. Knowledgeborn Allah When I mentioned standout features, I was talking about exclusive ones. The Pixel doesn't really have any. They marketed the phone as having the "best camera on a smartphone", and that's turned out to be a debatable subject among people depending on their perspectives - whether they like realistic colors or oversaturated photos. The Google Assistant is now available on pretty much every Android phone, just like the fingerprint scanner gestures. The hardware from the front looks strikingly similar to the iPhone -which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it leads people to question why they should get an iPhone lookalike, when they can get the real iPhone for the same price. The display is decent, but it's not even as good as the one on the Galaxy S7. Google ditched stereo speakers for a mediocre mono speaker. Pixel Imprint is noticeably slower than the fingerprint sensors on many cheaper offerings. The Pixel launcher was all the rage, until pretty much every third-party launcher started adding many of its features into their custom launchers. To make matters worse, the device is almost always completely out of stock online and unavailable to purchase through carriers. And those are just basic factors. Add to it the fact that Google just published an EOL report for the Pixel, solidifying the point that it'll stop getting Android OS updates in less than 2 years from now, and people are going to say, "F**k that!" That's why, personally, I think they should drop the price and salvage what's left, unless they really don't care about selling them. whispy_snippet Price and value are not intrinsically linked with "premium" products. You don't just drop the price on a product you're trying to position as high end because it's gotten a little older. You're only going to tarnish its reputation. A major reason why many people buy high end premium products is BECAUSE they're expensive. Marketing 101 mate. Phones are modern day status symbols. I remember when the Pixel launched some people scoffed at the price and said "well I'm just gonna wait for Google to discount it in a few months". I tried to tell these people that it wasn't going to happen and that the best "bang for buck" time to buy the Pixel was actually launch day. And here we are, months later, and the Pixel is still being positioned as a high end premium product. And believe me, it'll still be priced at the high end right up until the Pixel 2 launches. Apple have long been the masters of pricing their products at the high end of the market despite cheaper alternative offering features that savvy buyers demand. But look how well Apple has done. Billions of dollars in the bank thanks to sales in a product often considered a step behind the cutting edge. If you want a cheaper phone with certain features important to you, get one. There are countless options. But give up on the idea of a cheap, affordable Pixel. It's NEVER going to happen. Knowledgeborn Allah I'm not disputing that. You're correct in saying that many people buy high end products because high prices give the illusion of inherent quality. The problem, however, is that the Pixel is competing against the iPhone, and it hasn't worked. In fact, it can't and won't work. There aren't any Android OEMs who can realistically compete with Apple. They may design devices that compete with the iPhone, but they can't compete with Apple. Why? For starters, continuity. When you buy a Pixel device, you're buying a product. When you buy an iPhone, you're buying into the Apple brand and ecosystem, where all their devices, ranging from the Apple Watch to the Mac to the iPad, iPod Touch and Apple TV, and even AirPods and Beats wireless headphones, all work seamlessly together. Secondly, you're buying into the Apple Store and it's customer service benefits. Thirdly, you're buying into Apple's update cycles, which come directly from Apple to all their devices instantaneously and average around 4-5 years of support. The list goes on and on. Google isn't naive. They have their own ecosystem, but it's centered around their software and services, which you can get on practically any device. They don't have a hardware ecosystem. They knew what they were getting into, and they took a chance by trying to compete directly with the iPhone in pricing. They also see that it's clearly not working, so it's time for them to adopt a new strategy. If they actually want large groups of people buying their devices, which I'm not entirely sure they do, they either need to have standout features like Samsung Galaxy devices (which they don't), or they need to lower their prices. Right now, lowering the price on the Pixel is the only way they can salvage it. whispy_snippet I disagree on many levels. You don't establish yourself as a hardware company overnight, and you don't establish a product's premium reputation overnight. Yes, Google doesn't have the same hardware ecosystem Apple has at this stage. But they've now got skin in the game that matters most - phones. All of the products you listed from Apple don't come close to the significance of the phone. Many will never own an Apple TV, a MacBook, or Airpods. But almost everyone owns a phone - and we don't know where hardware is going to take us next. Maybe in a few years time tablets will be dead, everyone will be using hybrids and home assistants will be one of the most important gadgets in our lives. Who knows? The point is just because Google doesn't have the same suite of products as Apple doesn't mean they won't one day, or that they won't be the company that leads the pack in the hardware that matters tomorrow. Further to this, just because the Pixel lives in an ecosystem different to the iPhone doesn't mean it can't be a success in its own right. Google is known for its class leading services. What happens if it starts gradually making these hugely important and much loved services - like Google Maps, Google Drive, YouTube, Google Photos... even Google Search - Pixel exclusives? It sounds improbable - almost impossible! But it serves as a reminder of how powerful and influential Google is in the services EVERYONE uses, Apple customers included. Google entered the hottest fight in consumer tech and delivered a hugely impressive smartphone on its first attempt. It wasn't perfect, but it bettered the competition in a number of important ways. Who knows what Google has in store for the Pixel 2, 3 or 4? They're in this for the long haul. You can't expect the Pixel to sell like the iPhone and Galaxy S in its first, second or perhaps even third iteration. But as time goes by, the Pixel will stand shoulder to shoulder with Apple and Samsung's best in the minds of the average consumer. There's too much at stake for Google to sit this one out. Knowledgeborn Allah I think you're missing my point... I'm not saying Pixel can't be a success. It definitely can be, but Google needs a better strategy to make that happen. When you're competing against a company that has a structured, proven hardware ecosystem that seemingly locks users in, you have to do something extraordinary to break them out. Samsung is doing that by releasing groundbreaking smartphones. OnePlus is doing that by undercutting flagship devices via pricing. What's Google doing? The idea that Google has leverage because of their services is naive at best. Google isn't going to make their services exclusive to the Pixel or its brand because they make too much money from their portals. If they restricted YouTube to the Pixel, everybody would switch to Vimeo or something else, and Google's stock would plummet. The same goes for pretty much all their other services too. The only leverage they have is in financing, and that's very comparable to Apple anyway. In fact, I think Apple may actually be worth MORE than Google at the moment. In reality, Google will never try to conquer the hardware space. Services are their moneymaker, and the more devices they can attach their web services to, the better it is for their bottom line. That's what it's really about, at the end of the day: money. The Nexus program was more popular than the Pixel, even though there was far less advertising for it, because Google implemented a strategy of undercutting their competition. They probably thought that meant people just loved their devices and decided to launch a "premium" product. In reality, one of the main selling points of the Nexus line was its affordability. The Pixel doesn't have that, and that's why it's not selling. Again, they need to undercut their competition in pricing, or they need to implement standout features that are exclusive to the Pixel. I see those as the only sure ways to salvage the disaster that is the Pixel line right now. whispy_snippet Maybe grab yourself a cup of tea... “I think you're missing my point... I'm not saying Pixel can't be a success. It definitely can be, but Google needs a better strategy to make that happen. When you're competing against a company that has a structured, proven hardware ecosystem that seemingly locks users in, you have to do something extraordinary to break them out. Samsung is doing that by releasing groundbreaking smartphones. OnePlus is doing that by undercutting flagship devices via pricing. What's Google doing?” But is Samsung making ground breaking smart phones? Is Apple? No one is doing anything especially impressive at the moment. A larger display is a nice to have, and I've no doubt everyone is going to follow this trend, but it's not what I'd call “ground breaking”. The same applies to hardware features like wireless charging, stereo speakers, or dual cameras. All nice to have, but merely extensions of core concepts of how we use our phones. So what? I think Google has a unique edge through its ability to leverage its vast swathes of data and machine learning to create personalised services that no one else can. They’ve been leading the game in key areas of software and services for many years now. That’s not to say Google is perfect of course, but take mobile photography for example. With the Pixel, Google was able to enter the phone market and best the competition first go through software expertise. And look at Assistant. It’s way ahead of Siri despite Apple getting the major head start. Google Chrome is the leading web browser. Google Maps is the leading mapping service. Google Search is so dominant in our lives that it spawned the phrase “just Google it”. Smartphone hardware has just about reached conceptual maturity but software and services are absolutely ripe for further innovation. And if I had to bet on which company has the greatest potential to revolutionise this space I’d bet on Google. Not Apple, and definitely not Samsung. “The idea that Google has leverage because of their services is naive at best. Google isn't going to make their services exclusive to the Pixel or its brand because they make too much money from their portals. If they restricted YouTube to the Pixel, everybody would switch to Vimeo or something else, and Google's stock would plummet. The same goes for pretty much all their other services too. The only leverage they have is in financing, and that's very comparable to Apple anyway. In fact, I think Apple may actually be worth MORE than Google at the moment.” Of course Google isn’t going to flick a switch overnight that takes all its services away from non-Pixel users. I’m not suggesting this would be any sort of sensible strategy. But it’s not hard to see Google making certain features of these services Pixel exclusives as a first step. Let’s picture ourselves a couple of years from now. Hypothetically speaking, what if Google started giving Pixel users access to “YouTube Sports” for free? Or what if they gave Pixel users 2TB of Google Drive storage for free? Or what about unlimited uploads to Google Photos for free? ...wait, they already do this. What about exclusive access to the Google Assistant? Wait, they did this too in the launch stage of the Pixel! Can you see what I’m getting at? In the coming years, as the Pixel gains further traction in the minds of the general public, Google will be better placed to leverage its strengths and make the Pixel a value proposition no one else can offer. Imagine all of the above I’ve listed, and more, only available on the Pixel? Google has a huge advantage on the cloud service side of the equation - an advantage that I think is going to prove increasingly valuable in the coming years. “In reality, Google will never try to conquer the hardware space. Services are their moneymaker, and the more devices they can attach their web services to, the better it is for their bottom line. That's what it's really about, at the end of the day: money. The Nexus program was more popular than the Pixel, even though there was far less advertising for it, because Google implemented a strategy of undercutting their competition. They probably thought that meant people just loved their devices and decided to launch a "premium" product. In reality, one of the main selling points of the Nexus line was its affordability. The Pixel doesn't have that, and that's why it's not selling. Again, they need to undercut their competition in pricing, or they need to implement standout features that are exclusive to the Pixel. I see those as the only sure ways to salvage the disaster that is the Pixel line right now.” Google is trying to conquer the hardware space right now. Chromecast, Chromecast Audio, Google WiFi, Google Home, the Pixel, Daydream, Chromebooks, the hiring of Rick Osterloh as SVP of hardware - there’s evidence of Google’s push into hardware everywhere. But you don’t usurp hardware empires like Apple or Samsung with the click of the fingers. This is a long game, one that is going to rage for years to come. If Google continues to develop the Pixel at the same rate it’s developing its services (and by all indications this is Google’s intention) its phone will be a formidable force sooner than you think. The unrefined, “rushed” gen-one Pixel won critical acclaim from tech sites and bloggers everywhere - for example Android Police, The Verge, and MKBHD all rated the Pixel one of the best smartphones one could buy when it launched. Labelling the Pixel line a “disaster” is as laughable as it is bizarre. Clearly it’s selling well as Google is having huge trouble keeping it in stock. And yeah, part of this is because Google is botching its supply train, but teething issues were to be expected. The message to take home from these issues is that there’s a demand for Google’s first phone. It is selling. Not at iPhone or Galaxy S levels, of course. Not yet. But anyone with a reasonable appreciation of the smartphone industry never expected it would. But I would definitely expect the Pixel 2 to sell better than its first gen sibling. Onward and upward. You’d be foolish to underestimate the second most valuable company in the world. Knowledgeborn Allah You're making some really good points... But I highly doubt Google is not trying to conquer the hardware space. They may be merging themselves into the hardware space, but dominating it? That kind of growth would eventually make them a virtual monopoly! They'd be shut down before they reached that point. There can be groundbreaking features of a device without them revolutionizing the way we use our devices. Based on your presentation, the only groundbreaking device on the market would be the BlackBerry KeyONE, since that literally changes the way someone would use their smartphone, at least a modern one. And, by the way, I'm not calling the Pixel a disaster in and of itself. I'm talking about its sales figures when compared to its competition. It's a pretty good device. I've had several issues with mine, and it's been far from perfect, but it's definitely not horrible. However, money is what matters at the end of the day. It's priced in the same range as the iPhone and Galaxy devices. Yet, it hasn't sold in numbers even remotely comparable to either of those. That's what I meant by it being a "disaster". whispy_snippet Apple has long dominated hardware. Why wouldn't Google aspire to be in this position one day? Why would Google be stopped when Apple wasn't? If Google sees an opportunity for growth that they're confident they can exploit they're almost obligated to go for it and provide returns for investors. Google may not ever reach a dominant position but I've no doubt its long term goal is to dominate. Just on the Pixel's sales figures, I'd reiterate that looking at gen one sales compared to the iPhone or Galaxy S is pointless. It really is. It's certain that many people still don't even know that the Pixel exists. What we need to keep an eye on is its growth. Will the Pixel 2 sell more than the first gen Pixel? Will the Pixel 3 do the same again? Will this growth be at the expense of Apple and Samsung market share? Just watch this space. I'm expecting it will definitely keep doing better in the years ahead. But it's going to be a fight. Knowledgeborn Allah I also think that the Pixel will see growth, year over year, at least initially. It's not going to be easy, though, regardless of Google's resources, because they're still going up against Samsung in the Android space. Personally, I think Samsung is going to crush the Android smartphone space for years to come, and there's not much Google can really do about that. The competing spaces, at least right now, are reserved for iOS and Android, and Samsung has gotten the dominant position in Android to become Apple's biggest competitor in the smartphone space. It took them years to get there, and I highly doubt they'd let that position be handed over to Google. The Pixel will be in a better position to secure the dominant position in the Android space if Samsung decides to start using their Tizen OS. Until then, Google will be fighting an uphill battle against Samsung, and they'll pretty much always lose. whispy_snippet We'll see won't we. Knowledgeborn Allah Indeed. Daishi Stop comparing it to an iPhone. Interesting point. When it comes to pricing the Pixel(s), they shouldn't be priced like an iPhone. Google doesn't have the nationwide support systems in place like Apple does. This is an argument for Apple's pricing for their phones. Why should the Pixel be priced as such without the same services??? Jarrett Lennon Kaufman They're at nearly the same level of services. Warranty replacement was intensely simple. Pricing is what it is. I can't argue it one way or the other. Reason was primarily to appear to be in the same class. It's psychological, and there's merit. But the entire point of this article was NOT that the iPhone is the better buy, which is why the comparison makes no sense to make. Daishi How are they at the same level of services? Of the 490 Apple stores in the world, the United States has 269 of them. Each offers not just sales of Apple merchandise including Macs, iPods, iPads, iPhones, Apple watches and Apple TVs, but service them at each one as well. This is the level of services I am talking about. Where are all the Google Stores where I can take a Pixel phone for servicing?? Google does not have this level of support anywhere in the world, so why should they price their gussied up Hold This Cat 10 phone like an iPhone??? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Because it was designed to look like an iPhone to make people believe it was worth what you'd pay for an iPhone. And it has G on the back. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman Because, again, the warranty replacement process *without* a store is insanely simple. Simpler, since Apple generally requires you to rely on a store, and there are massive swathes of the country not near them. Also, you left out the word "nearly" to support your strawman counterargument. They're NEARLY at the same level. Also, you're lumping in unrelated things. We're talking about the Pixel, not the entire Android ecosystem. What other devices Apple supports through a store is irrelevant. And you can bring your Pixel to a UBreakIFix store for support, as well, FYI. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ They're out of stock because nobody is buying them. I've seen comments about how they can't find them at Verizon stores. That's because Verizon only stocks phones that they can expect to sell. That's basic business sense. Knowledgeborn Allah That makes a lot of sense... But what about the online Google Store? Google won't even make them available to purchase online, as if HTC isn't even making them anymore. Kevin Aaronson Goddamn, those Bluetooth issues sound nightmarish. I would loose my mind! QueenLuLu So much this!!! I completely agree with this article. I currently have a Pixel, OnePlus 3T and LG G6 and despite all the great qualities the other phones have, I find the Pixel to be the most enjoyable and "complete" Android device I've ever used. And believe me, I have pretty much used them all! I want so much to love my G6 more, but it's impossicant. Better specs or no; the performance and be usability of the Pixel is awesome! I really hope Google steps up with the Pixel 2. If they did, I think it would really give this industry the kick in the rear it needs. whispy_snippet Great read as always, David. But I'm just wanting to ask some questions on the Pixel's Bluetooth performance. Is this just based off your own personal experience or have you got some data to indicate this is a widespread problem? I own a Pixel and use Bluetooth all the time. I listen to podcasts and music over Bluetooth headphones on my daily train commute, I sometimes use my portable Bluetooth speakers outside when I'm having a BBQ or a coffee on my deck, and my 2017 Subaru Impreza has Android Auto - which as I understand uses Bluetooth to transmit audio. Has there been the odd hiccup? Sure. But on the whole Bluetooth performance with my Pixel has been perfectly fine. No stutters, no disconnections, no nagging drop outs and relatively quick connection times. Obviously this is just my personal experience, but if I'm reading your review correctly, the problems you mention seem limited to your experience also. Maybe your accessories and not the phone are the main culprit? I just think Bluetooth sucks in general, personally. Taco Monster At least with my Mazda 3, my wife's Z3C is much much more reliable than my XL, which craps out a lot (see my other comment on this thread). I've found it to be okay with speakers and BLE devices like our August lock. whispy_snippet Hmm I'm a little sceptical about Mazda and their reputation for mobile consumer tech. They're still not officially onboard with Android Auto and Apple Car Play - instead they're still pressing their notoriously buggy and clunky MZD connect in-house system. I'm speculating, but they seem a bit "head in the sand" if you ask me. thetimmysmalls They recently announced Android Auto and Apple CarPlay to come to most of their Mazda Connect systems... At some point. whispy_snippet Yeah I did see that. Promising. But we'll see. Brian Wolters When the Pixel first came out, it would often lock up and sieze my car stereo system to the point where I actually had to turn the car off for 2 minutes and then get it back on. It was frustrating to say the least. With the recent updates to the Pixel, I've not encountered this. whispy_snippet Nasty! What car do you have? Brian Wolters 2016 Jeep Cherokee with Uconnect. It hasn't happened since recent updates. It was so bad, I used another phone until it was known it was fixed. My name is…. Damage control??? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Google could draw a picture of a phone in crayon and sell it as the Pixel XL 2, charge $1,200 for it, and most web magazines would rate it the best phone of 2017. It's self-preservation. And then once you've done that, you can't admit you were wrong. That would not only be embarrassing, it would be biting the hand that feeds you. Tr3ple But do you have one Johny M It's called Appleing it. me me It's the 7 stages of grief after the Nexus 5. Wondering when the press stop writing words about the once-was-interesting Google products. Keith Stefanec Never experienced any of these Bluetooth problems that were mentioned. Single downward speaker sucks. Hopefully, the Pixel 2 will have a bigger screen like the Nexus 6. wjrandon Did you Google make you guys post this? I bet they did!!!! Taco Monster For your Bluetooth woes in the car, at least with my Mazda 3, force stopping Bluetooth Share under Apps does the trick for me. I've even set up a Tasker profile to do this automatically every 12 hours. 😤 I figured this out after resetting the car to factory settings a couple of times. Grey I think these phrasings are disingenuous. My Nexus 6P is the best smartphone I've ever used - it's bigger, it's thinner, it's faster (though I am currently sucking all the RAM out of it and it's constantly freezing up - but my Nexus 4 did that too) than my Nexus 4. That doesn't make it a phone I'm happy with. There's features missing I'd like to have. There's design choices I disagree with. Saying "This is the best phone I've ever used" doesn't at all mean "This is a great phone". Jeff Beck When you have used pretty much every mainstream Android device ever, as David has, it's not a bad compliment. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman ...it kind of does mean that, actually. Unless literally every phone you've ever used is utter crap. But considering who's writing the article, he's used pretty much everything. "Best phone I've ever used" does translate to "this is a great phone." 4Ui812 That picture is so apropos for the title of the story. (If you don't know what I'm trying to say you can ask) brenden gonzalez Loved the article David I agree I got the the pixel from Verizon pre-ordered it and got it the day before I went on sale I've recommend the pixel to everyone I know my parents switched to them my brother and sister did to and I got some friends to switch to it as well and we all love the software experience it's so amazing!! Best phone I've ever owned it's also the longest I've ever owned a phone in 2016 before the pixel came out I had 6 new phones in a year and never did I find one that I liked and wanted to stay on I've tried them all to HTC to Samsung to even apple and LG and sony and I can't put the pixel down! I can't get a new phone even after seeing the s8 I would recommend and buy a pixel any day over the S8 Plus I no like edge on screen hell no!!!!! I would break it and be mad so that phone is too breakable for me! Nigel Antonio I kinda agree, accept I haven't ever gotten any bluetooth issues, i've been in a case since day one, and I don't see wear and tear on the back panel.... I recommend this phone to everyone, but don't go buying it now unless you have an extra 1k burning a hole in your pocket then go ahead.... but I await the next version of the pixel xl 2017, should be dope. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman A few thoughts/counters, in both directions, from my own experience: 1. I have had NONE of these Bluetooth problems you described with any device, including several different headsets as well as my car. I can travel notable distances from it, work out with it, and no disconnects. BUT, I have a Pixel, not an XL. Could that somehow be a factor? 2. Warranty service, for me, was exemplary. Yes, there was a credit card hold, but I'm used to that for advance exchanges. Otherwise it was a 10-minute process via chat, the replacement arrived in two days and was flawless, and thanks to the overall Pixel backup/restore process, the transition was painless. Easiest warranty exchange ever. Also, she allowed me to decide, on my own, to skip going through a factory reset as we both felt I'd done enough of my own troubleshooting. 3. Now the bad one: my Pixel freezes on me semi-regularly. On the one I replaced it was sometimes several times a day, but on the replacement, after about two weeks of use, it's as much as once a day, as infrequently as once every two days. Full-on hard freeze necessitating holding the power button until it reboots. NOT good. Never had this happen before or anything like it on a previous phone. Clearly, if it survived the warranty replacement, it's an app causing it. But how can an app consistently freeze up the entire system to this degree? What's not preventing that? And why is there no easy way to troubleshoot that? This is really bugging me and is the only thing damaging what's an otherwise stunning, stellar phone that's my favorite of all time. Only other disappointment for me is not having an XL which is what I wanted at launch, but the store approved me for just under enough money to get a 128GB XL. I had to choose between 32GB XL or 128GB non, and 128GB was (and still is) more important to me. But I'd rather have the better battery life and higher-res screen for VR. Still, all-in-all, and especially if I can resolve the freezing issue, this is the best phone imaginable, and its limitations are nothing compared to its heights. But yeah... at this point, wait for the next one if you're buying a phone now. Toby Beveridge I have the 5" Pixel with the daydream VR headset and I don't have any issues.. the screen is good enough for me.. way better than my note 4 or s6 Jarrett Lennon Kaufman Cool. Not for me. The pixel density is a serious problem for my enjoyment. Ismail Akram I have bluetooth issues he mentioned and I use Airpods with my Pixel XL.. so I thought its Airpods problem with Android(cuz I rarely use that with iPhone) About freezing it happened to me when I was on beta but after beta I don't remember freezing on Pixel XL ( but it was annoying in the start and I was so dishearted ) I recently had to sell either iPhone 7+ or Pixel XL (so I can buy S8+) and I sold iPhone 7+ :-p cuz iPhone is so easy to get Niall Murray I have the same freezing problem. Often my phone will unknowingly reboot in my pocket too. gizak No BT issues here either and I use BT in my car and headphones daily. As for your freezing, I experienced this too... after some extensive google searching, I narrowed it down to an app or two causing it. Mainly, any older app that uses your GPS periodically to poll for your location. Check apps that use GPS and haven't been updated since the latest version of Android, they may still be accessing the GPS directly instead of asking the android system for location (the newer more efficient way). Wendy By "latest version of Android", do you mean any app that hasn't been updated to Android 7+ software? My phone has been freezing every few days or so, so I'd like to try this suggestion. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Are you talking about the Pixel? I'm curious if these apps freeze other phones with Nougat. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Wouldn't this mean that every other phone running Nougat would freeze up when running these apps? Have you heard of anything like that? gizak Hmm, ya, you would think so. I'm not a code monkey, so this was just a hunch. The forums I came across linked it back to a family locator app causing the freezes and mentioned GPS access as the culprit. For me though, it was the WebMD allergy app that periodically polled my location to provide pollen count that froze my Pixel up daily. When I uninstalled it, my freezes seemed to go away. Wendy I'm getting the freezing error as well. I've requested for a replacement, so I'm hoping that will solve the issue. It's been freezing every so few days or so, not as frequent as yours. motoridersd The only odd Bluetooth issues I have had with this phone are related to it turning off randomly, and it has only done it a handful at times since I got it 6 months ago. I can put the phone in a drawer, walk into another room at the other end of my house, and I get no audio dropouts. Works perfectly fine in the car too. The only time I've had annoying dropouts has been in crowded airport terminals where there are a ton of competing 2.4 Ghz signals interfering and I have the phone in my pocket on the opposite side of the receiving circuitry of my BlueBuds X. Even then, it's a quick blip and it returns. Bluetooth IS much worse with The Dash, but that thing has its own issues and it happens with any other Bluetooth device I use. Maybe the BlueBuds X just have great performance that make up for the Pixel's shortcomings. Jordan I have the regular Pixel 32GB on Verizon. I have had absolutely none of the issues you describe, though Bluetooth is weak, in that if myself or my dog are in the direct line of sight between the device the speakers/headphones, it will cut out. But I have had no issues with the bluetooth in my infotainment in my car (my S6 & S7 did make me reset it a few times, however). Other than the locked bootloader (-_-) it is the perfect device! whispy_snippet A friend asked me the other day whether he should get a Pixel. I said yes. Most "normal" people don't want to wait around for months to see what the next processor is, or whether the screen on the next generation of phones has a slightly better display to bezel ratio, or whether the fingerprint scanner is going to be on the front or back. They just want something that has all the apps they use and works well. The Galaxy S8 has more hardware bells and whistles than the Pixel, but if history is any indication, the Pixel is going to be much nicer to use over the life of both devices. And ultimately, user experience trumps everything if you ask me. Especially for the non-techie. King_Android And it's a good thing they don't read the AP site either. David is speaking to his audience i.e. us nerds, not normal every day consumers. disastrousrainbow Exactly this. Having worked at Verizon for many years, giving Joe Consumer the tech enthusiast viewpoint on why they shouldn't go with a phone that's a few months away from being replaced rarely worked. More so if they were replacing a damaged or lost phone. In a situation like that, I would wholeheartedly recommend the Pixel over any other phone right now point blank dot com. Even with the S8 out. Of course, this would only be the case if they said they wanted, say, the best camera around. Or wanted a reliable software experience, etc. Those keywords would instantly bring the Pixel to mind, and I wouldn't feel bad about sending them off with one because 9 out of 10 times when the next model comes out, they will really not care, especially if their phone is still working well. When it comes to your every day man, it's not the tech enthusiast you should be listening to when recommending something, but rather the needs of the person you're trying to help. Midnitte "When it debuted in October, the Google Pixel XL cost $770. The one you and I actually want, the 128GB model, cost $870. Six months later, the Pixel XL still costs $870. Is it worth it? Hah. No." Google is insane if they think a phone holds on to value that long. Considering all the high profile phones that have released after it, you'd think they would consider a price cut. MJ You have never taken an economics class huh? Supply and demand ring a bell at all? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ That's why you can't buy one. No demand, no supply. MJ I think have seen you troll enough on AP now. BLOCKED Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ LOL!! K77bkny Loooool people getting emotional over this bullshit device.... https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/649f431458908833d91263af6250ee8fbce01c1c6c9d7ca37827b1f65883a97e.gif Midnitte Six months sounds more like supply chain problems, not supply and demand. It's absolutely ridiculous that we're months away from the Pixel 2 and the Pixel 1 still costs $870 in the face of the Galaxy S8 and G6. Like the article, why would anyone recommend the Pixel 1 at $870 today? MJ It is a supply chain problem but that's irrelevant. The fact is the supply is not meeting the demand. Why would Google reduce the price on the phone? People are still buying it at that price regardless of what David, you, or I think about it. Cowboydroid After using a Pixel for several months, it is an insanely overpriced device. The only reason I own one is I got a great deal on it. Comparable performance and hardware can be had for less than half or even a third of the price. Sean People who write such things NEVER actually have a Pixel and are just haters. Those of us that actually have a Pixel (or XL) think they are superior to any phone we have ever owned........thanks for playing. Tr3ple You're so right about that. Cowboydroid Writing this from a Pixel XL right now, fanboy. Why get so emotional about a device? Debanjan Chowdhury I have been using alot of smartphones​. I used the OnePlus 3t, Nexus 6p, iPhone 7 plus, and even I have received the galaxy s8 plus yesterday. And I can surely say pixel xl will still be my daily driver. I am not a fanboy. I always support which works best for me. Yes, if Samsung had opted for a better camera, bigger battery and better fingerprint scanner position, I would have changed my daily driver to s8 plus. Good camera, snappy performance and stock Android are the priorities for me. And my pixel xl gives me all of these things. The Samsung galaxy s8 plus still has just little bit of hiccups here and there. But pixel xl, smooth 60fps all the time. And receiving updates at the earliest and it's unique update system works amazing for me. I would be really happy if it was water resistant. But I can't change my daily driver for only one benefit because pixel xl provides me dozens​ other benefits than my Samsung galaxy s8 plus or s7 edge and​ my iPhone 7 plus. Ismail Akram I had Oneplus 3 and I found Pixel XL to be more smooth and feels better than Oneplus. beside I love monthly security updates and loving that I can try android O( which I already did) and that Camera is really awesome. I think when Huawei can sell phones over $700 why not Google. (I would love if it was cheap but overall experience justifies that money for me) JD Man you need to raise your standards Sean Opinion: Even if you can, you probably shouldn't buy a Google Pixel anymore Winston David: Am I just a brainwashed Google fanboy (don't answer that question)? Yes. No. Probably. Maybe. Unlikely. Believable. Not sure. I'm a rebel. Andrew I know it's nitpicking but. I think you missed an 'us'. 'The Hardware' section, 2nd paragraph, last sentence. "...but I think it's safe to say most of want more screen where we can get it." Vivek Rameses Nobody is buying that piece of shit anyway. This is laughable. AndrewGM Good review, although if it's really the best smartphone you've ever used, then isn't it worth the premium price? Personally, I'm willing to pay another $100 or so for a phone I will use often, every day, for a couple of years and really enjoy using. The extra money in the end is nothing. I bought a used Pixel on eBay, so I saved about $50, but I really like it and am happy to pay a bit extra. The camera is great -- better than the iPhone, which I switched from. ddevito Remember when Android Police was an honest unbiased, tech savvy site? Alex Completely agree. Best phone I've ever owned, by far. Smooth as butter. Google just needs to work on their audio apis, along with other stuff. chumpatrump ive had a p6 huawei for 5 months and its feckin awesome. android like its meant to be - fast, stable, solid, easy to use, 36 hour charge TechGuy22 It's fine for what it is. I like mine. I still prefer my s7e over it. Maybe pixel 2 will better Vic Chai Was Nexus 6P your number one choice? Jon I've only ever connected to a Bluetooth speaker but never had a single Bluetooth issue ever.. Captain On! To whomever has a problem with the "don't buy this phone" line: if you're going to spend nearly $1000 on the Pixel, you're shortchanging yourself by not waiting less than half a year to spend the same amount on an upgraded device; you'd just be flat-out fiscally irresponsible. The 1st Gen Pixel will be a fine purchase after the Pixel 2 comes and the Pixel 1 goes on sale. At that point, it's fair game. You can save money and get a good experience, or you can pay more and get a great experience (relative). kaladdin I have had the Pixel XL since the launch. Yes, it is overpriced but the software experience alone makes it the best Android phone. P.S. I have never had any issues with the Bluetooth. Jago1908 Sorry, I just wasted some time here. I have my Moto X Play for one year now and it feels just as good as the time when I bought it. You're not selling it well. Give us a bit more. You're just leaving it personal. I prefer to use a cheaper phone that is as consistent as the Pixel. There are plenty. Come on! AhmedAlalfy Well why am I surprised ! A site as big as Android Police has to still suck it just not to piss off a company like Google. Well you could have deleted your (opinion article) better than making a fool of yourself like that. I know you said it's a good phone but these two articles in this order are just wrong. Be a man and stand for your words next time or just don't talk if you're afraid you're going to piss someone's off. I'm sound like hating I know but that's how I see it anyway take it or leave it. … I have a regular pixel.. it's awesome. Very consistent. Zero issues. No Bluetooth issues either, and the range is far superior to the Galaxy s7 we have to, so is the audio quality. Almost all his complaints I have never experienced, maybe it's a pixel xl thing? Idk.. and my battery life, is amazing compared to every other phone I have owned. I use a fair bit, and it lasts full day, usually still have 35-40% by 1am.. I stream music on and off all day, apps, surf, video.. usual stuff. No issues with slow finger print scanner either. It's bloody instant. I've owned Windows phones, and many "high end" android phones, and the pixel is the most reliable, most consistent phone I have had. I would buy again hands down. I'll take a product that just works right every time over bells and whistles. Yes make improvements, of course, but it really is the best overall phone I've ever used. Amit Raj I have been using the XL for about the same time...aside from the Warcraft struggle to get the phone, I agree with everything pointed out here. I do get these odd feelings to switch phones to the S8+ but I have no regrets with this phone. Having come from a flavoured android device (S6 Edge), I can vouch for the Pixel's fluidity, and consistency in performance. The only spite I have is the lack of android releases post 2018. Even Apple updates their devices that are nearly 5 years old. Why can't Google?! I can understand why any of the other ostensible android device manufacturers wouldn't rather can't update their devices to the latest android OS...hell they release devices like Rabbits reproducing. But for Google, come on you come out with 2 devices in a year and you can't give us atleast 4 years of android OS updates...leaving aside this rant, I really think you really get the real experience of having a smartphone...i.e. Android really puts the "smart" in smartphone and running it in its native state and on the Pixel it really outshines any other mobile OS to date...hands down....P.S. the Google keyboard could really get some AI updates for suggestions...other than this and the android OS upgrades, I'm a happy camper... Akshay Mehta Has anyone talked about the unlimited storage available in photos app ? I've shot photos and videos of more than 12GB since I got my pixel xl 6 months back. The camera and a consistent battery has just pushed me take so many photos! Even though I want to switch to s8, I can't. I'll just wait for pixel 2. Even though there have been numerous issues with the phone I still love it! Niero Gonzalez Buy it used. You can get a 32gb pixel for $400 on ebay, unlocked. Probably $300 when the new one is released. Unless you're an Android journalist there's no reason to buy an $800 phone unless you really want to show off your sushi photos Ryan Gray What's killing me is the screen burn in. Go watch a youtube video with a primarily solid color. Buttons and notifcation bar cant be unseen. Alisi Google any phone that has an AMOLED display about burn in. blindexecutioner I prefer the OnePlus 3T to the Pixel I sold. Never thought I would say that but I just don't care for the UI choices Google is making. Having the fingerprint scanner on the front along with capactivie buttons is really nice as well. Debanjan Chowdhury I also have a pixel xl and I love it. Debanjan Chowdhury Triggered Samsung fanboys, incoming. Debanjan Chowdhury I am using a pixel xl too but I never had Bluetooth problems​ like you​. OK Google detection never broke for me. I didn't have to replace it or anything like that. And I am happy to be in India because the low stock issue is not here. blueman24 No way I'm buying a 57k phone. Especially when its available in the US for more than 10k cheaper while still being overpriced. Peter Silie Why do you Keep talking about the 128GB version as the version "you and I actually want"? I wouldn't even know what to do with that much space on my phone. I'm on a 32GB N5X with a s**tload of apps installed and a lot of downloaded Play Music titles and I still got 10GB of space. So no, the version I actually want would be the 32GB non-XL Pixel ;-) Alisi Do you play games? Have daydream? I've already had to do the "you don't have to go home, but you can't stay here" dance several times with my 32Gb. Leroy Filon The stock availbabilty is insane. I live in the Netherlands and it's not even out here yet. I drove to Germany back in november to get it. People ask me a lot about my phone when they see my mobile pictures on instagram and i'll tell em it's the Google phone with pride. But it's a shame i can't share this epicnes with fellow owners here in the Netherlands. Michael Sørensen "I rarely really get annoyed using it." Really? "The Bluetooth connectivity sucks. The back of the phone has very obvious wear rub. The glass window scratches easily. It's not waterproof. 'OK Google' hotword detection breaks for no apparent reason, necessitating a reboot (...takes a minut-plus...). The fingerprint scanner is slow..." Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ LMAO... like I said, he didn't even list all of the flaws. If that's the best phone he's ever used, he set the bar incredibly low. I can't even imagine what worse phones he was comparing it to. Maxr1998 Well, G6, S8? They do some things better, but he says the Pixel is better at other things, so in the end it wins. 3223 I dunno about you guys, but from what I read almost all reviewers cannot grasp exactly why it is better than other phones, other than 'it just is'. They can say it is smoother, and faster and all that, but hard data doesn't seem to back up that claim and they rubbish synthetic benchmarks over some abstract claim. I'm starting to see that having a G at the back of the phone, just like an apple logo, may have a placebo effect on its own, bringing people some good vibes, just like nexii phones in the past. Which makes for an interesting read or research as to how brands can affect perception. Jan Ibrahim No. İt's nothing to do with placebo. There are very real significant improvements in touch latency which make a huge difference to your experience. İt's not a commonly spoken about feature or spec, which is why a lot of reviews might not know why the phone feels better. But that's the main thing. 3223 That's the thing. Touch latency is a very common issue on android. And tbh I've been using an HTC 10 which reviewers mentioned when it launched that they tried to reduce touch latency by quite a lot. Additionally if i remember correctly the htc m8 (which i also used before) was regarded as having low touch latency as well. So why is it that when other manufacturers do it, it's kinda swept under the rug but when the goog does it, it becomes the coming of the messiah? You're right though, that there should be more definite tests on touch latency, coz I'll only believe it when I see the numbers.. Theuntje How can you love the camera? Doesn't your main camera sucks in recording video? Looks even like that my front camera is better at capturing video.. Michael Sørensen Can someone please link to a video showing off this legendary fluidity compared to others? Why is it so difficult to actually show when it's apparently oh so obvious? David Newman I'd be interested to see how they compare to the MI Mix, my guess is not very well 🤔 roberto.elena Here is an idea for the next poll: Does David suffer dissociative identity disorder or is he just a troll? 1. Definitely DID 2. Definitely troll. 3. Even if you can, you shouldn't read everything he writes. 4. All he writes, including his personal Twitter, is gospel to me. Peter World Citizen This is the way I see it ... 1. David said don't buy the Pixel now 2. His Google tipster said he/she didn't like what he had said 3. David quickly back pedals with this article :) Kostas 💪🎩 you obviously didn't read it till the end Daishi Or at all... BeholdersEye I don't understand why there is no stereo speakers! Damnit Google, you're​ pushing the damn daydream view vr set then you don't put speakers on top and bottom (left/right in landscape mode), so BS! Google better offer trade-in for upgrade phone! And I certainly don't care for the extremely short software update deadend of only to 2018! We paid big bucks we deserve longer support!!!! Randy Gindy Everyone kind of dropped stereo speakers. Its really been replaced with a half assed version of stereo on some phones. Bottom firing and using the earpiece. username_not_valid I can only assume you havent used any other phone ever then. Nothing else makes logical sense. Jeff This is absolutely one of the worst phones I have ever used. It just had great marketing. For close to $1000 no Ir blaster to control remotes, people complaining about sound distortions, horrible and tedious screenshot capabilities and I don't think it charges fast at all. I'm going back to Samsung as soon as the note 8 is available. Cakefish October can't come soon enough! I need a Pixel 2 for the buttery performance, the amazing camera and the fast updates. Meanwhile, I'm stuck with the Galaxy S7, a great phone no doubt, but one that is showing signs of ageing (oleophobic coating wearing off, a battery that doesn't last as long as it used to and Android updates that come once in a blue moon). glebosotov Nice comment with funny mistype(is that how it's called?). BUTTERY more like battery Alisi Maybe he meant buttery as in smooth? glebosotov Maybe. Anyway, I think that most of us don't speak English as native language, so it's ok Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I don't know if other OEMs have this problem, but I suspect pre-S8, Samsung batteries have been notorious for aging quickly. Even my Note 4 battery died way before it should have. The only good thing is I didn't have to take it to a shop to get it replaced. Patrick Smithopolis The camera and the smooth and consistent performance is why I don't have the urge to get a new phone. someone755 Long-term? Fuck man, it hasn't even been a year. The fact that you need to point out how well it's held over less than half its already limited lifetime can mean only one of two things; Either you're trying to compensate for the fact that the phone isn't as good as you'd hoped it would be (which may or may not be related to its inflated price), or you indeed are a head-over-heels Google fan. For all the shit I defend you against, David, I expected better of you. alcor86 Why the hell don't people put phone cases & screen protectors on their phone? I do that right out the box. Peter Ebenezer I agree, I love the pixel. But every single person I've talked to about it, I've told to not buy it. Purely for the Bluetooth issues. My galaxy S2 I had before this had rock solid Bluetooth but was incredibly old so needed to modernise and was fed up of manufacturers that delay updates by adding bloatware.. The pros outweigh the cons. But the con is a big one... Not to mention the fact they are on about spitting out the next one already... chris My z5 just hit a reboot disaster I picked up a pixel xl 128gb for $950 aus, best phone I've ever used and no dramas with Bluetooth after first week, I was holding out for pixel 2 but didn't make it.. I'm happy with my buy anyway , it's a brilliant phone , buy off eBay not a store and save $300 that's my advice.. What supply issues lol GregAndo Thanks, I have pretty much had every Google phone phone since the Nexus One, and whilst also loved the form factor the Bluetooth issues, Battery issues and OS bugs pushing me to weekly reboots were more than I could handle. So I took the S8+ after the note 7 went back... and skipped the Pixel XL. So glad I did, I had the same issues and they infuriated me in the end. When Google finally gets the build of Android out that focuses out these bugs...I might go back. Tool then i am happy with the S8+ so far, I hope it is more reliable. Keg Man Waiting to hear from the note 7 owners. Most of us thought that was the perfect phone despite the one manufacturing defect Kakairo This matches my experience with the Pixel XL, with the exception of wear and tear (probably due to the slim Spigen case I put on it). With the Bluetooth, though, I wonder if it's an issue with Mazda Connect (I know you drive a Miata, David, I have a Mazda 3). I haven't had any issues with Bluetooth headphones, and I've had two rental Nissans in the past month that worked without issue for over a week. Would I buy it again? Yes, absolutely. Would I buy one right now? No, for the simple fact that the S8 has now surpassed it and that Pixel 2 can't be too far away. sam1331 Uh, the Pixel XL is a big phone. The Pixel is even a big phone, bigger than the iPhone 7 in every single dimension. They sell an iPhone SE that is significantly smaller and people buy it. My point is that, claiming no one should consider the Pixel because the Pixel XL isn't too big isn't an opinion, it's "lunacy". Rod iPhone 7 is 4.7" Andre Meaux Yep! Still love my Pixel (XL)!! Looking for the Pixel XL 2! destinyhud cant wait for the pixel 2. its going to be even more awesome. it will be a day one buy for me Rod There's one thing I wonder about the Pixel: in those PhoneBuff "speed tests" the Pixel is always put to shame when it doesn't hold more than 4 apps in background. However, in this one, it was able to hold 13 apps, being 4 of them, games. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ugcpul8nYg) Who's telling the truth, afterall? mattcoz I had issues with Bluetooth cutting out with my headphones, but then I turned off "phone audio" and it has been perfect. I have noticed that the signal will get weak if I sit on it, but uhh, yeah that makes sense, so I don't do that. Jordan L just this morning, for the first time ever my car would not connect to my Pixel. damn it. Rod David's curse Mike I must have a Pixel XL that is the diamond in the rough. I have a travel job, meaning I'm in rental cars several times a month. I have never once had bluetooth connectivity issues, for real. Henry S. Maybe it's just me but I don't understand this need to go YUuuuuGe with screens anymore. We've reached the point of usability and carrying the damn thing. 5" was the sweet spot for me as a phone. If I want media, I'll watch on my tablet. My perfect phone size was the old Droid MAXX(also a 5" phone). Most of the points make sense. I get the same battery life as you on my OG Pixel except Bluetooth. Only exception is switching between devices on my wife's small Bose speaker and we always have problems no matter the phone so it's not just the Pixel. Xenios Kofteros Got a full refund for my 1.5 year old Nexus 6P for the known battery issues. I'd very much like to buy a Pixel XL, but the price for new and used are ridiculous. Hopefully Google will break tradition and reveal Pixel 2 at Google I/O. Or else I'm going the OnePlus 5 way and break 4 years of Google phone use tradition. ClikFire _ I haven't had any of the issues you mentioned except the issue with hairline scratches because I hate using cases. SoI covered the glass windows with a Matte Black Dbrand Skin and found a Tempered Glass screen bezel which actually transformed the Dark Grey Bezels to true black bezels and covered up the scratches in the process. Also coming from an S7 edge I actually really like the Design of the Pixel personally especially the back with the Glass window, makes it stand out from the rest. If the Pixel 2 looks like this and adds front facing speakers and water resistance I'm game. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/842173829c88496d628fe9ecdf0b77f65995d3ca89cb1a2d93e7896ad2c760f1.png Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ If Google continues the current trend in its phones, it's more likely to look like this. ;) https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/6945f5a7bc54ba27628971ea239b5d6ee5d8f0bb2b8aa844f6e67a2d6ec05c12.png Rod I was about to burst in laughter, then I thought this may actually happen. Ozl Never had any problems with my 128GB Pixel, still works great! krkn I got the Pixel 128GB when it came out because I had a Note7, which I loved, and the XL was unavailable. Despite the smaller size, I have still really enjoyed the phone. Like you said, it remains snappy and the better life good, and sometimes I actually appreciate something that fits in my pocket so nicely. Photos are terrific. My main gripe is the speaker location, which is blocked easily in landscape mode, but that's a small nit since if I really need better sound, I'll be plugged in or using a Bluetooth speaker. Randall Collins I have the XL and I haven't had quite as many issues with mine but it really is a great phone despite all that. No lag, smooth, and the first to get updates with no crazy UI to destroy the experience. And I updated from an iPhone 6+ which had all those same attributes. No phone will ever be perfect but for now, the XL works for me. likurges if the phone was so great as it's bezzels it would be the best phone ever Randy Gindy At least I have something to hold onto when I watch a video. likurges yes because a phone is a heavy thing and doesn't have corners. thank god for the bezels of the pixel. also think for example if you hear some shocking news, you can hold to those bezels and they might as well save your life Randy Gindy Sue me for wanting something to hold without risk of accidentally touching the screen while watching YouTube. Peoples obsession with minimal bezels is just a asinine as Apple's obsession with maker their phones thinner. likurges no one here is talking about no bezels but an highway on your phone is too much. I agree that having no bezels is not optimal but neither is having bezels that are too big. IMO the top bezel on the nexus 5 was perfect size JR I'd have no problem recommending either of the Pixel devices to potential buyers, today. Many buyers enter the market for a new phone, because they need one. If you're one of those people who only updates their device when the current one is on its last leg, then the Pixel is an outstanding option (six months isn't something many would care to wait). The casual buyer primarily needs a good experience, preferably over a long term, and as discussed in this article, the Pixel delivers this quite well, 'right now' (to be fair, that's *if* you can find one). If the price drops once the Pixel 2 launches, even better. If you're talking to enthusiasts, then we can push this a few ways, but we always have the option to sell the Pixel, should we desire the new shiny thing. The Nexus 6P (still a great phone) fetches nice prices in the aftermarket, and the Pixel is generally understood to be an even better phone. I'm sure the Pixel will command a fine (but lower than new) aftermarket price, and there will always be a set of buyers who can't afford the absolute latest, but will be willing to scoop one up at a more realistic discount. So unless the device is missing game-breaking, hard features you rely on (waterproofing, because you're a part-time lifeguard), then I think it would be acceptable to recommend it. Fastguy77 This article makes no sense. I purchased a pixel brand new for half price, best decision ever. Phone is amazing. So by all means, find someone selling it below MSRP and grab it. Waiting half a year because 'you'll regret' not having the newest is typical tech buyer stupidity. So, just wait and never buy a product, cause around the corner is the next better version... xyz "Is the XL worth $770 to pick up today?" Wasn't worth it even at release!

Google Maps gains Street View images for directions and a bottom bar for location info, directions, and more Cody Toombs Follow View All Posts 2017/05/12 6:03am PDTMay 12, 2017 30 Plus 1 on G+ 49 Share on Facebook 49 Share on Twitter Total Shares128 Applications Downloads News Videos Go check out the Google Maps app and you might notice a few things have changed since the last time you poked around. In the last couple of days, Google pushed some changes to the Maps interface that add street view images to the directions screen. It seems there's also another change showing up on more recent versions that will also move around a few widgets on the screen. When you begin planning a route between two places, the directions screen will now show thumbnails from Street View with every turn in the list Tapping on the image will open up Street View's full 360-degree viewer and direct it to the location of the turn. In the couple of tests I've done with it, Street View seems to also be oriented correctly for the view you'll have as you are driving – meaning it won't point you at the wrong side of the road. As a bit of trivia, Google first introduced this feature to the Maps web interface right around this time of year back in 2008. There's even a video introducing it. Left: Older example. Right: New example. The other notable change is more widespread throughout the interface, but it's a mostly cosmetic adjustment. Many screens now include a bottom bar with contextual activities, often accompanied by a button on the right side. It takes up more space, but it functionally replaces the FAB (Floating Action Button) on many screens, or at least one of the FABs. This design may remove some confusion for users that don't immediately recognize the icons, but it may take a little longer since some users will have to read more. This is probably an experiment, but Google may eventually add this type of bottom bar to the Material Design Guidelines. These changes appear to have been activated remotely, so it's possible some users saw these much earlier as part of a test, while others may still see the older interface for a while. Street View thumbnails are showing up on versions of Maps going back at least as far as v9.51.1, the bottom bar seems to be limited to v9.52.0 and later.

Useful stuff added every few weeks of great quality and a ton of Easter eggs too. Wish Google would clone them for every project Deeco I assume, it's because literally everyone relies on Google Maps with biggest user base. fjleon there was a time a few years ago that Maps sucked, they were removing features such as offline maps. glad to see it improving this time around mike shwilly But how many more years will pass until they make buildings visible during navigation?

Cody Toombs Thanks for reaching out. I don't personally watch the tips address (well, very rarely I glance at it) and your email must have been missed. David Slawotsky Thanks for replying. So where should I send tips next time? Cody Toombs The tips address is still the best place. Things usually don't get lost in there, but it can happen, especially if there's a lot happening that day. Computator I have sent in several tips before and they have seemingly been lost or ignored as well. They were all things I would have thought would be fairly important. I don't send small trivial things or whatever. For example, iirc I sent in a tip about Google photos adding support for raw photos several weeks before AP had an article about it. I also pointed out several major details about how it worked that were left out of the article and that AP seemed unaware of. Ahmad El-Ibrahim David Ruddock also has his Twitter DM open for tips, but only if needed. I'm sure if any spamming​ or annoyance will get someone blocked. Manard Yeah, I've had it for a while too.

It's the primary action! Why move it to the bottom when all the functionality is unchanged? I feel like Googlers are trying to give themselves work to do at times, especially when they act askew to their own design guidelines. catalysto I think the standard for the FAB was that there should only be one, so they were already breaking their own rules by having the double FAB. I agree though that if you are looking at a location, the FAB should change to directions.

Project Treble will arrive on smartphones running Android O and beyond. Google stated that the process of updating an Android smartphone to the latest version is time consuming and costly for smartphone makers, which is why the market is so fragmented. The tech giant’s attempt at solving this is Project Treble, which Google says it’s “the biggest change to the low-level system architecture of Android to date.” The life of an Android release requires multiple steps that must be fulfilled. Firstly, the Android team publishes the open-source code for the latest release.

For example, wives on social media could call their husbands "amazing" or "the best." On Google, "a jerk" or "annoying." Stephens-Davidowitz spent five years studying aggregate Google search data. Berkeley Lovelace Jr. | @BerkeleyJr 12 Hours AgoCNBC.com SHARES show chapters What your Google searches says about you: Author    Friday, 12 May 2017 | 6:51 AM ET | 03:40 Want to really get to know someone? Well, you may not find the real answers on their social media accounts, ex-Google data scientist Seth Stephens-Davidowitz told CNBC on Friday. In an interview on "Squawk Box," Stephens-Davidowitz, who left Google after spending the last five years studying aggregate search data, said people search Google for things they might not divulge to anyone else. "People are constantly lying. They lie to friends, family members, to surveys, to social media, even to themselves. But they tend to be really honest with Google," said Stephens-Davidowitz, author of "Everybody Lies: Big Data, New Data, and What the Internet Reveals About Who We Really Are." Stephens-Davidowitz, who calls Google "digital truth serum," said people's search histories reveal some pretty bizarre and disturbing things. He said people living in areas you wouldn't expect to have high levels of racism often search for racist content. People also search about anxieties and insecurities that they wouldn't post about in real life or on social media. In the book, Stephens-Davidowitz said sometimes the findings are amusing. For example, wives on social media may call their husbands "amazing," "the best" or "so cute." On Google, however, they might search "a jerk" or "annoying." The data from Google could present a potential gold mine for marketers and business leaders who rely on using real data from people. Stephens-Davidowitz recommends those businesses use Google Trends, which he says is an underused source. Stephens-Davidowitz said all the data researched is anonymous and is pretty safe from a privacy perspective. But he warned about hacks to personal accounts that could reveal such data. "If someone hacked my account, I'm screwed. We're all screwed," he said.

A New Google Pixel Phone To Feature Android O, Here’s What We Know So Far. May 13, 2017 by Staff   Filed under Opinion, Tech/Internet, Weekly Columns 1 Comment Like Like Love Haha Wow Sad Angry 1 Tweet (ThyBlackMan.com) Talks about a new Google Pixel phone are at peak, as the Google I/O 2017 conference is just around the corner. The three-day event is scheduled to begin on May 17 and Google Pixel 2 or Google Pixel Taimen along with the two new Pixel phones is expected to be unveiled sometime soon. There are chances that the company will at least unveil Android O features and release date during the event as the new device is said to run on Android O operating system. The good thing is that a new Pixel phone details just appeared in a database of Geekbench, a popular mobile benchmarking app. According to the available details, the new Google Pixel phone named Google Taimen will run on Android O. The new version of the Android OS has already been announced, and it is also available for developer preview. Just like the last year’s Android N, the unnamed Android O is expected to be launched sometime in late summer or October. If the leaked details are something to go by, the new Pixel phone will come equipped with Snapdragon 835 octa-core processor. As usual, Google has codenamed the new phones, and it appears that the company will release three phones this year. Other than Google Taimen, the two phones include Muskie and Walleye. While there is no information provided by Google at this point, if both HTC and Google design new models keeping the issues from the previous releases, and inspirations from the latest hardware upgrades in mind, we will have some excellent smartphones from Google this year. So should you expect what is being circulated on the internet? Well, you should not. The specifications available on the website suggest that the new Google Pixel phone gives a score of 1804 in single core and 6248 in multi core. On the other hand, if you look at the Samsung Galaxy S8+, the test scores are 1929 and 6084 respectively. So it is very clear that if this is what Google is planning to bring with Taimen, it won’t stand against the rivals in smartphone market. The phone will not even compete well with OnePlus 5’s leaked scores of 1963 and 6687. Since Google hasn’t confirmed whether these three devices will be beating the upcoming smartphones from the companies like Samsung and One Plus or not, nothing can be said at this point of time. There are chances that the numbers are probably the test scores when the device is running on a mid-level processor. Earlier this year, many reports claimed that the new Pixel phone will be powered by Snapdragon 653 chipset, which is a mid-range processor. So given this, there are chances that there will be a mid-range variant of the phone. There is one more thing which you should not ignore. The tests were probably taken and the scores we see represent the lowest possible clock speed. So, if this is the case then Google’s Pixel phone will definitely won’t disappoint users in terms of performance. Either way, the announcement of the upcoming Google Pixel phone is still far away. Since the company hasn’t shared anything specific about its lineup of smartphones in the Pixel phone series, taking the leaked details with a pinch of salt is probably the best way. If you look at the last year’s Pixel phone, it was undoubtedly a groundbreaking device with beautiful design and powerful performance. With the 5-inch HD AMOLED screen, a 12.3 MP rear camera and an 8 MP front camera, the Google Pixel phone was and still is a complete package for smartphone enthusiasts. It would be really interesting to see how far Google will go in terms of user-friendly design, performance and software with its upcoming phones. Staff Writer; Corey Shaw Have any Tech Tips? News?

At first I thought Google couldn’t make a premium phone to compete with Apple & Samsung. With the Note 7 exploding it allowed the Google Pixel phone to take center stage.

Google's "Project Treble" will modularize Android to make updates faster Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/05/12 12:42pm PDTMay 12, 2017 95 Plus 1 on G+ 162 Share on Facebook 76 Share on Twitter Total Shares333 Android O Android OS Development Google News Easily the most annoying aspect of using an Android phone (with the exception of Pixel/Nexus) is slow updates. Android 7.1 (which came out last year) currently sits at 0.5% marketshare, and brand new phones are still being released with 6.0 Marshmallow. Google is aiming to solve this with "Project Treble," which will modularize part of the Android OS to decrease the time OEMs spend updating their devices. If you're not familiar with how Android updates work, here's a summary. Google releases a new Android version, which silicon manufacturers (e.g. Qualcomm, Mediatek) have to supply drivers for. Once that's done, device makers (e.g. Samsung, HTC) can start re-adding all the tweaks they have made to the new Android source code. In the case of carrier-sold phones/tablets, device makers then have to wait for the carriers to approve the update. After all that is done, users finally start to receive the update. Google is hoping to speed up this process with Project Treble, which changes the architecture of Android. Essentially, a new 'Vendor interface' will contain all of the low-level software for a device - like the chipset drivers. Google will work with chipset manufacturers to make sure the Vendor interface is forwards-compatible, and the interface will be validated by a Vendor Test Suite (VTS). The aspect of this news I'm most excited about is that the Vendor interface is forwards-compatible. There have been many cases where chipset manufacturers have not updated drivers for specific popular chips, preventing devices using them from being officially updated to newer Android versions. One example is the Nexus 5 and other Snapdragon 800/801-based devices, which were never officially updated to 7.0 Nougat. It sounds like the Vendor interface will prevent this from happening, or at least prolong the end of support for a given chip. Google says that Android O will be the first version to use the new Vendor interface, and the Android O Developer Preview already has it. Hopefully we'll hear more about Project Treble at Google I/O next week. Source: Android Developers Tags Android android o project treble treble vendor interface vendor test suite vts subscribe ...

Hopefully this means Google can update more core system functions similar to Google Play Services independent of the OEM/carrier path. Mike Updates still have to go through carriers, this just helps prevent devices from early EoL and should make OEMs jobs easier by not having to rewrite every piece of code to work with new drivers. TechGuy22 that's why this is useless. carriers are still involve and OEM like samsung takes time with their own skin destinyhud thats why i buy pixel. also, like mentioned this will reduce the amount of modification needed in android's new version which means slightly early release. even if its 2 weeks early i am good wit it TechGuy22 or or you can push google to make things easier for carriers and OEMs and not bandages i have an S7 edge and a pixel xl. go figure Taco Monster You can't make things easy for someone who doesn't want to do said things. bekifft It's why I buy Pixel too but the whole point of Android was supposed to be freedom and choice. If my only real choices are Google or Apple, I might as well buy a damn iPhone. PI This Daniel Not necessarily. All the OEM has to do is bring their crap (skin) from the last android version. Of course that probably only happen with small android updates (8.1?) Zsolt V Why shouldn't they? By all accounts, they add value so it's worth the wait. CA-Sandra Fuchsia is a very long term project. It's not going to replace Android anytime soon. Dextro I've been saying for ages that Android needs an hardware abstraction in the vein of what Windows has in its driver model. Hopefully this is it and helps get those updates out faster. Sadly I expect that the endless stream of UI customization OEM make will end up killing any kind of benefit this brings. Corbin Davenport I want something like that too, but I'm not deeply familiar with the technical structure of Linux/Android, so I would assume sure there some massive limitation that is keeping that from happening. Dextro I think (but am now 100% sure on this so don't quote me) that Linux historically hasn't had any such abstraction. Drivers are meant to be inside the kernel and compiled for each specific version. That works fine if the code is open source and committed to the kernel repos but it becomes a nightmare for binary blobs. The kernel makes no allowances for stable driver APIs, they will break stuff and won't worry for anything outside of the kernel if I remember correctly. That's probably part of the reason why Android has failed to keep up with Linux kernel versions. keithzg The kernel makes no allowances for stable driver APIs, they will break stuff and won't worry for anything outside of the kernel if I remember correctly. I wouldn't really say this is true. In fact, there is a very stable API provided by the Linux kernel. Hell, one of the most famous Linus rants was about this very topic: It's a bug alright - in the kernel. How long have you been a maintainer? And you *still* haven't learnt the first rule of kernel maintenance? If a change results in user programs breaking, it's a bug in the kernel. We never EVER blame the user programs. How hard can this be to understand? WE DO NOT BREAK USERSPACE! https://lkml.org/lkml/2012/12/23/75 Obviously drivers are trickier, but they're still expected to continue working. The big catch comes in that ARM drivers tend to come as compiled binary blobs. There really isn't an allowance for that in the workflow of things for Linux; good citizens are supposed to provide source, and then new kernel versions and the drivers therefore (often within the kernel itself) are recompiled, and everyone's happy. But while the API remains the same, the ABI does not; drivers compiled as modules for an older kernel won't work on newer ones, even though the drivers would almost certainly work fine if they were recompiled. The ARM space is utterly lousy with proprietary drivers (in no small part this is Qualcomm's fault, although they're far from the only offender). Hence you have Google forever backporting kernel updates to older kernels, so that the ABI remains consistent and older device drivers continue working. Dextro Well, I stand corrected then. But one question then: I was under the impression that drivers were not in userspace but in kernelspace. That's why I didn't even think much of that famous Linus rant. keithzg True, they're (generally; FUSE, for instance, is an area of exception) in kernel space, and that rant isn't entirely applicable because of that, but for practical purposes that just means ABI changes break drivers. And the kernel devs do reserve the right to change the in-kernel API at any point, which could in theory break drivers---it's just that in practice they are rather worried about such breakage and don't wish to do so, and barely break it more than they do userspace. When you think about it, it'd kindof be an insane amount of maintenance if people had to update driver code for new kernel versions! Luckily for "desktop Linux", most drivers these days in the x86 space are open source (NVIDIA is remaining holdout, although even there you can fall back to the Nouveau drivers most of the time), so they're just baked into the kernel or provided as kernel modules, and in practice don't really have to be touched by human hands after they're originally written. Unluckily for Android, that is very much not true in the ARM hardware world. Hell, most Chinese OEMs will just flatly refuse to provide kernel source, even though they're legally obligated to do so. Gaurav Kumar Which is why fuchsia has a stable ABI...like windows. I agree it's not coming anytime soon but it may not be that far away as well.. Lawstorant in the linux world, the answer is DKMS. There's no need for kernel catch-up anymore. I bet Google is doing something similar. Сергей Бугаев Android has the HAL https://source.android.com/devices/#Hardware-Abstraction-Layer -- but it haven't been helping much, as we can see (or would it be much worse without it?). It'd be interesting to see more technical details about Tremble to understand how it's different. Andy J https://developer.android.com/things/index.html pretty much this is what they are aiming for - from the days of Project Brillo. "System updates and support: We provide the system image, updates, fixes, and more, so you can focus on creating compelling products" Brillo/Things is the same idea - there is the low level vendor stuff, the actual OS and then the OEM stuff. Google can update the OS on running devices in the field, without worrying about the vendor stuff or the OEM stuff. Knowledgeborn Allah Exactly... And, unfortunately, this probably isn't going to be anything like Microsoft's new update process for Windows 10 Mobile, which doesn't have to go through carriers. Based on all the software modifications most Android OEMs make with their devices, this probably won't speed up OS updates at all. More powerful devices may last slightly longer, but that will still leave it to the OEMs to support those devices for longer periods, and they likely won't do that anyway, since they're constantly trying to get you to purchase the next one... Zsolt V Windows 10 what? Knowledgeborn Allah Dismissing Windows 10 Mobile (and rightly so) doesn't change the fact that Android needs to learn a few things from them. Their update process, at least right now, is still miles ahead of anything Android is doing. Google should've followed the path that Microsoft already laid when it comes to updating software systems outside of the carriers. It looks like they took one thing that's beneficial but disregarded all the other necessary parts... ¯_(ツ)_/¯ Zsolt V As in how to drop 50% of the devices with the Creators update? No, thanks, Google has nothing to learn from that process. Knowledgeborn Allah Again, you're still missing the point... This isn't about dropping support for any devices with the Creators' update. This is specifically about them bypassing carriers to directly deliver updates to their consumers, which they can sustain for longer periods of time. Google has a lot to learn from that process. Zsolt V Doesn't matter. The end result is the same, the user doesn't get an update. You are missing the point, maybe you don't have one? Knowledgeborn Allah Maybe I don't have one? You sound like an idiot, bud... Maybe you have difficulty reading. I specifically stated in my original post, which you replied to, what the point was: "And, unfortunately, this probably isn't going to be anything like Microsoft's new update process for Windows 10 Mobile, which doesn't have to go through carriers." Again, the point was based on the fact that Windows 10 Mobile updates - regardless of how many people actually have Windows 10 Mobile devices, or how many devices will be discontinued due to the Creators' update - don't have to go through carriers. That's the point. Android as a platform can learn a lot from that. Before making ridiculous replies about a subject and, in effect, making yourself look dumb, maybe you should read the post you're replying to first. Just a thought. PVL_93_RU Windows 10 mobile is dead Knowledgeborn Allah https://www.onmsft.com/news/latest-windows-10-mobile-updates-bypass-carriers-update-phones-directly Say what your want about Windows 10 Mobile when it comes to development, but it's definitely not a good look when a "dead" platform can update their devices better than Android can. 🤦🏾‍♂️ Robabobbob So which windows phone OEM is actually making a modification anything close to what android OEMs do? Knowledgeborn Allah That's not the point... The point is that you can separate core Android OS functions from the themes and launchers inherent in other variations of Android provided by other OEMs. Right now, Android's update process is a disaster. Even after the OEMs push out updates to their devices, it still has to go through various carriers to actually get to consumers, showing that the carriers are actually the ones in charge. Windows 10 doesn't have that problem. iOS doesn't have that problem. Android has that problem. bekifft I agree completely about the HAL, but the real problem remains the network operators retaining strict control over user devices. If AT&T doesn't want to spend the money to add AT&T Navigator, AT&T Device Locator, AT&T Messages, etc etc etc, they will simply not deploy the update. SomeGuy112 This is great, gives the potential for much longer OS update support, especially for Googles own hardware. Hopefully the OG Pixel gets longer than 2 year OS support because of this. destinyhud good point Dn Bro Didn't the article say the new devices with O will have this? DragoCubed The dev preview for the pixel has this project. We can assume it's staying with the pixel MrHanMan So, is it Trebble, or Treble? Jdban Treble according to the google docs Corbin Davenport It is Treble, I can't spell. Fixed. Jeff The trouble with Trebbles... destinyhud i really hope this fixes the 2 week delay in getting major update to nexus devices /s John Doe This is good but Google need to do more. They need to modularize everything in the Android update process. Create a separate carrier update so the baseband can be updated separate from the OS and same to drivers and also OEM skins/Apps. This should have FIVE different updates paths: 1) Core OS/Kernel update path 2) Driver update path 3) Baseband/Carrier related Apps update path 4) OEM Skin/Apps path 5) Security update path This way Google can control the Security, Core OS, Baseband, and Drivers by working with carriers and silicon manufacturers. Also if T-Mobile for example wants to push an update out for the baseband and messaging/phone apps they can do that independent of Google and OEMs. The same goes for Samsung and Qualcomm and others. Latheryin You are confused on one part. What you call skins are not what you think they are. All of the OEM versions of android are completely different distros that replace core OS files and frameworks with their versions. John Doe I know but If Google were to modularize it then it would just be a "skin" or "theme" that is separate from the framework/OS this will give Google control over the main OS and the only way to do that is to not allow OEMs to modify it too much. Latheryin Which would remove all the extra features that devices add on. Many have to be tied into the frameworks and other base OS drivers and libs. There is no separation in it really. And with the way they licensed Android they cant really control a whole lot. Any OEM could easily reverse anything Google does and still release it. John Doe Well yeah of course Google can't do that alone they would have to make new agreements with OEMs and carriers. Most OS skins do not have that many extra features and Google can create APIs to allow OEMs to modify anything they want like if Samsung wants to add an Iris scanner as a password or whatever. The point is OEM "skins" need to become more like launchers in the play store like Nova and Apex and If OEMs want to modify something they would have to ask Google like how Microsoft treats windows. Latheryin You really dont have a great understanding of how things work. That will never hap=p=en. Maybe with Googles second mobile OS they might try to have more control. John Doe How about instead of being an arrogant prick, you tell me what I said is incorrect or what Google cannot do? Why do you think this cannot happen? Microsoft did this with Windows mobile. Like I said, Google would have to sign new licensing agreements with OEMs and Carriers but they probably have to revise it for this Project Treble anyways. Google already uses its Apps and Play store as a bargaining chip to update those agreements. Latheryin Ok first. Google would have to change the license under which android is licensed. Which can't be done. Also have you ever ripped Android apart and had a look? I would guess not as if you had we would not be talking about this. As for what we does does. That really is apples and oranges. Not even close e same thing. The apps and play store are not really that big of a deal. There are hundreds of android devices released every year that don't include them and they sell really well. John Doe You said NOTHING I have not said already. Why Google cannot change the Android license? What stops Google from implementing this since you are the Genius that ripped Android apart and decided this cannot be done? Google already has MADAs in place and they update them every few years with OEMs. Those devices are mostly in China since Google services are banned there. If the Play store is not a big deal then Samsung would have forked Android a long time ago. But go ahead I am still waiting for your "intelligent" replies. Even Amazon's fire phone failed miserably without the play store and Google apps. Latheryin Have you even read the license? Do you really have any idea what happens when something is licensed? Doesn't take that much really. Anyone can look at the code. Heck some of the best android developers are teens. Samsung already did. It's called tizen. Also Samsung is not the end all of devices. They even have a separate store for the devices they run with Android. All Samsung apps don't even hit the Play store. They are Android devices for the common man. Made for everyday people. Ask your favorite developer what device he runs. Look if you want to know more why not dig in, instead of trying to get into a tech conversation when you don't really know too much about it. John Doe Licenses can be updated and their MADAs can be updated which they already do. Samsung did not fork Android, they created a different OS. And that is not turning out very well for them. You still have not told me how what I said cannot be implemented. You should go get one of those Teen Android developers to help you out before you just turn down ideas that you have know nothing about. If Google wanted to they can change Android to how Windows does updates there is nothing stopping them from doing that and OEMs will not fork Android if they did that. I love how you just criticize arguments without providing valid reasons instead of just saying Android does not allow you to do that provide factual reasons or STFU. klaus666 Could this also help to port LineageOS to a smartphone once LineageOS is adapted to this new modular system? jgarrido I dunno, sounds like treble to me... JD OK I get that Google is essentially making what in the Windows World is the HAL and breaking that out of the Kernel and they're essentially creating a lower level API (For lack of a better term) to segment off Android from the OEM mods. However what is actually stopping the OEMs from sayin' fuck this ain't working out let me go in there and refork it anyway. I mean API's are there, now and OEMs should be using that to interact with Android but Android is coming up short so they fork it and custom build the ROM with their own customization and branches. For the longest time the camera stack was a HUGE reason for doing this, even now the Camera2 API is still coming up short, which is why Samsung Completely branches on their own for that too. freshprince_87 Google simply needs to make it mandatory for carriers /OEMS to update their devices and release new phones in the most current version of Android Adnoxaei They could make it a requirement for access to the Play store. Without this interface, that would have been very restrictive. With this interface, customizations can still easily exist, so companies may be more willing to cooperate...espevially if it cuts down on the time needed to test and deploy updates boop By the sound of it, the Vendor Interface is for SoC manufacturers, not device makers. jcopernicus Sweet! Can't wait for my Z3 Compact to get this update! NubCake This doesn't sound like a treble idea at all, hopefully it helps the slow updating process. Knowledgeborn Allah I see what you did there... 🙄😂 ddevito No bass.... Tom Westrick But what if a user is all about that bass? Killa Then they might be in treble if that's all they are about. Sorry, couldn't help myself. :P Emergency Medical Hologram Bassed on what? Martheen Cahya Paulo There's plenty of tweeter surrounding it. Dolby so if we consider the stereo type. Testraindrop While this is certainly a step in the right direction, I somehow doubt that this will change Googles attitude to abandon their own devices after 2 years. Its not like the SOC in the Nexus 5 stopped working when N was installed, in fact its working fine, developed by independent individuals without having "to work with chipset manufacturers", which Google apparently couldn't even achieve. Also the times where google stops updates for the N6 and the Pixels is already set, so even with a chipset blob that is "forwards-compatible" there wont be any further (official) updates. Also if those Vendor APIs will have limits to certain OS aspects like camera, sound etc., then manufacturers will not use them and will just fork again the OS as done currently. saf1927 The custom ROMs that work on Nexus 5 devices don't actually benefit from a lot of things that an officially supported device would. Qualcomm has completely abandoned the chip so from a retail perspective, it's not suitable anymore. Even the "security updates" that these ROMs show in "About phone" aren't actually all implemented, since none of the proprietary blobs and binaries could be updated. Just because a device can be updated with a custom ROM, doesn't mean it's actually running it well. someone755 "Just because it's running it well doesn't mean it's running it well." Welp. saf1927 Wait, what? I can't find that sentence anywhere and I don't remember editing the comment. AbdulB1 Mediatek and in some cases​ Qualcomm (for Nexus 5,sd800,801) don't want people to stay on old phones they try to force them to buy new phones for latest Android version. I am not sure will they be happy about this change? I suspect they will flood market with phones running Android nougat instead. They will try to resist this change by Google. saf1927 Mediatek and Qualcomm aren't device makers, they are silicon manufacturers. AbdulB1 Mediatek charges device makers for new drivers for latest Android versions. Qualcomm stopped supporting sd 800/801 for Android Nougat and thus even sony a device maker who was developing Android N developer versions for a SD800/801 stopped. Chipset makers also have huge clout , it not just sensor makers who decide to support or not their older hardware for newer Android release. saf1927 Well, my point is that none of the silicon manufacturers will force anyone to make only Nougat phones, like you claimed. AbdulB1 "Google will work with chipset manufacturers to make sure the Vendor interface is forwards-compatible, and the interface will be validated by a Vendor Test Suite (VTS)." so if Vendor dont get validated for VTS then do you expect any chances of Android O for those devices? dizel123 I suspect if OEMs want to release new phones with the latest OS version because that's what their users want(I know I'm making assumptions) and Mediatek and Qualcomm try to force them to release phones with Nougat, then Intel will suddenly become a dominant player in the mobile market. This would be exactly the kind of "in" they're praying for. AbdulB1 Intel architecture is quite old , I owned 2 Intel based Android tablets. Intel even didn't bothered to upgrade the OS from 4.0.4 and other one had 5.0 as latest release even it though it was buggy as hell and every hardware vendor went for 5.1 instead. Intel had an edge of running windows along android on their cpu tech. But lack of proper built in modem destroyed their chances in Android world. Their SOCs still had quite high consumption even after releasing newer and newer generations of Mobile SOCs. dizel123 I don't have any inside information, but I'm guessing Intel is working on fixing their problems and making high quality SOCs Cakefish Intel dropped out of the mobile SOC wars. It cancelled development of all upcoming chips last year, I believe. dizel123 Their announcement at this year's Mobile World Congress as well as their current road map on their website both indicate that they're still developing mobile SOCs Cakefish So has it changed since this? -> http://www.anandtech.com/show/10288/intel-broxton-sofia-smartphone-socs-cancelled dizel123 Read my last comment again Lateef Alabi-Oki Jesus! What took them so long? pfmiller I believe there are performance costs to adding hardware abstraction. Google may feel that mobile hardware is finally at a point where it's worth the cost. Justin Martin This was my question. What is it going to do to performance. Not that I'm a Samsung user, but how much will touch wiz suck now? AbdulB1 Will it help in churning out custom ROMs? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I actually want the vendors to work on Android itself, not just their layer. They fix a lot of the bugs that Google leaves in. saf1927 They are already working on that: "In addition to the architectural changes, we're working with our silicon and device partners to take their code changes, such as features for a carrier network in a specific country, and move them into the common Android Open Source Project (AOSP) codebase. For example, Sony and Qualcomm contributed dozens of features and hundreds of bugfixes to Android O so they no longer need to rework these patches with each new release of Android." Simply put, some vendors contribute more than others. Sony is a great example in that regard. They contribute a lot. dizel123 This might just be the best thing Google has ever done to Android Eddie Ringle If you want to see more technical details, here's a bit of what I found back in March when the Developer Preview was released: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13928385 SHunter Orrrrr.... https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/7b191be55920725d6f6aba09c97c1e1942bdfb290cb4cf53e2cb9e23c706626c.png Eumelanin Knight Better late than never. Let's hope Carriers and Manufactures don't have their way and muck this up some how. bekifft At least they're being up front about the problem finally and making it an official "project." It seems like every year the promise is "we're fixing battery this time" and "we're fixing updates." Every year. Never gets better. And with the current FCC and the network operators only set to get worse about their abusive practices, I don't hold out much hope for this plan. What it boils down to is if there is any possible way for network operators (carriers) to meddle with the update, they will. This practice truly aught to be illegal, but see above. Maybe this will at least help lazy to the point of negligence OEMs (Lenovo) not be so appallingly slow. Islam sounds like a joke to me. John C.S. Lock When you finally giving up on Android after 10 long years , here we come iOS ! charfarstar I'll believe when Pixel 2 comes with 4 years of OS updates. MeCampbell30 Turn the treble up in my headphones. Régis Knechtel OMG! I can't believe they're finally doing something about it! https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/5acada086a36a588b7289e5b2a26d7c5f205e0b15a6c77c9b631f1a387dc8d2a.gif Cypher Hey guys and gals, let's add more abstraction to make this slug of an OS even slower! But hey, at least you'll get more frequent updates so that it can get slower more often! xyz People have been telling Google to use their muscle with the chipset makers forever. Qualcomm didn't release drivers is not an acceptable reason to not update Android. Sir_Brizz Hardware manufacturer doesn't release drivers is a perfectly acceptable reason not to update. Consumers should level their hatred at the right target. Blaming Samsung, for example, for Qualcomm's shortcoming won't change Qualcomm's policies. Andy J So last year it was A/B updates from Project Brillo and this year it's the ability to update the OS independently from the low level chipset drivers and the OEM stuff - which is also something Google developed for Project Brillo. While there are no actual Project Brillo / Android Things products in the market yet - it was definitely a worthwhile project for them with these rewards. (Yes I'm aware Chromebooks had A/B updates - but from everything I have heard, they still came about because of Project Brillo, even if Project Brillo wasn't an actual thing when they found their way to Chromebooks) kelpa32 it take google untill android O to try to get updates on time. Urmil Shroff Am I dreaming? Is this really going to happen? PI -This things don't work as u r expecting it ., Google can make guidelines but cant force OEMs to follow it . Oem will still not pass this ,, they will rant about high testing methods and quality benchmarks , ultimately they will pass it for devices only which they want (flagships) only ,, PVL_93_RU This is huge for Android in general. Of course the ideal way of doing things is following ChromeOS model where Google is entirely in charge of managing and updating the software, but then we'd lose out on what makes android unique, which is OEM skins Still though, modular updates are hopefully the next step that will really accelerate how fast devices receive OS updates. Especially mid-range and budget models Patel Nisha I swear I see something like this for every release but yet never happens Paul It's all fine and dandy but I suspect most phone companies still wont upgrade them because they want us to upgrade to newer phones so keeping older phones on older firmwares is in their interest so I don't think much will change. In any event, I'm happy that Google is doing this because it's one less excuse phone companies have to not upgrade their phones, but personally, I think Android could do with something like what Windows does with upgrades so almost any hardware can upgrade to the latest Androids without the manufaturas getting in the way. TonGi018 This is really exciting news! Android Developer Will this also lead to more updates, over a longer period of time ? boop Potentially, as it eliminates the forced EoL when the SoC manufacturer drops support, but it's still up to OEM and Carriers to develop and distribute updated. Android Developer Maybe for Google Pixel , at least? Maybe more than 2 years of updates?

(AP Photo/Gene J. Puskar, File) SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — A rare order from a federal judge alerting prosecutors to possible criminal misconduct by Uber or a key executive deepens the turmoil swirling around the ride-hailing company at a time when it's grappling with other legal and image problems. District Judge William Alsup in San Francisco referred a civil case filed against Uber by Waymo to the U.S. Attorney's Office "for investigation of possible theft of trade secrets." It threatens to trigger a second U.S. government investigation of a company that has pushed the legal boundaries through most of its eight-year history. At stake is Uber's estimated $68 billion valuation, a possible public stock offering and the future of its self-driving car program, which its CEO has said is the key to the company's future. Story continues below video × Advertisement Waymo, a self-driving car company owned by Google parent Alphabet Inc., sued Uber in February alleging that Uber is using stolen self-driving technology to build its own fleet of autonomous cars. The U.S. Attorney's Office in San Francisco didn't respond to requests for comment. Experts say prosecutors are likely to follow up on Alsup's order and launch an investigation. The probe, combined with other legal and image woes, will reduce Uber's value and in the worst case could threaten the San Francisco company's existence if investors leave, criminal charges bring huge fines and legal action stalls autonomous car research, the experts say. Uber wouldn't comment Friday on a possible criminal probe. Federal prosecutors already have requested information from at least two cities about use of phony software to thwart city officials looking at whether Uber was following local regulations. Alsup wrote in his order that he wasn't taking a position on whether prosecution was warranted. Alsup, 71, has gained a reputation as a no-nonsense judge since he was appointed to the bench in 1999 by President Bill Clinton. The Harvard Law graduate has experience in trials involving high-profile technology companies, including a 2012 patent and copyright infringement case pitting Oracle against Google. For a judge to take such a public step, he must have more than just a whiff of criminal activity, legal experts say. Prosecutors get many tips, but rarely do they come from a judge who is familiar with evidence and the legal elements of what is a crime. "This is not some private informant that slipped an envelope under the door at midnight. This is public and it's a judge," said Erik Gordon, a law and business professor at the University of Michigan. An investigation would siphon executive resources at Uber just as CEO Travis Kalanick faces many other challenges, said John Coffee, a Columbia University law professor who specializes in white-collar crime and corporate governance. "The possibility that you could get criminally indicted would be exactly the wrong thing for Uber," Coffee said. In addition to the apparent inquiry into the software called "Greyball" to impede city inspectors, Uber still has to deal with Waymo's high-stakes espionage lawsuit. It alleges that Uber is using trade secrets stolen by a former Google engineer, Anthony Levandowski, who formed his own company which was bought by Uber $680 million. After that deal, Levandowski began to oversee Uber's self-driving car division. Waymo contends that before leaving Google early last year, Levandowski downloaded 14,000 documents with details of a navigational tool called Lidar that robotic cars need to see what's around them. Uber has vehemently denied using Waymo's ideas, maintaining that its Lidar is radically different. Meanwhile, Levandowski has refused to answer most questions posed by Waymo's lawyers while asserting his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. He recently agreed to step down as Uber's top self-driving car executive, though he still works at the company. Beyond the possible criminal cases, Kalanick in February was forced to quit President Donald Trump's council of business leaders after Uber was boycotted by some customers. A female former engineer made a series of sexual harassment allegations about her boss, and a video of Kalanick berating an Uber driver went viral, forcing him to concede he needs leadership help. Earlier this week, Uber suffered a huge legal setback when a European Union judge ruled that it was a transport company and could be required to get licenses and permits in the 28 EU nations. Uber had sought to persuade Alsup to send the dispute between Waymo and Levandowski to private arbitration hearings. But the judge rejected that request, meaning the case will play out in a public court, risking further image damage for Uber. Just months ago Uber was discussing what could have been the largest public stock offering in history, but its troubles now make that all but impossible, Gordon said. Uber can survive the troubles, but it has an uphill fight, said Gordon. If the court finds that Uber used Google's Lidar technology, that will slow Uber's autonomous car research, leaving it behind competitors. The company would either have to pay Alphabet to use it or buy it from a supplier, both expensive options, Gordon said. The company's strategy of fostering rapid growth by flouting laws may wind up being its undoing, Gordon said. "The empire is striking back." ____ Krisher reported from Detroit.

When you’re innocently browsing the web, it’s deeply unpleasant to think that faceless technology corporations are monitoring and recording your every move. While such data collection is legal, that doesn’t mean it’s all right. There are plenty of things you might prefer to keep to yourself, such as your income, your sexuality, your political views or your membership of the Yoko Ono fanclub. For an indication of what can be inferred from your online habits, take a look at the Apply Magic Sauce tool produced by Cambridge Psychometrics Centre, which produces a profile of your personality based on Facebook and Twitter data. And while you might console yourself with the knowledge that all of this information is mostly used for targeting ads, that might not be the case for much longer. The internet giants are building up ever more detailed user profiles – and finding new ways to exploit that information. In the Observer, Carole Cadwalladr’s ongoing investigation has highlighted how analytic techniques were used in the recent EU referendum to target and craft messages to groups of persuadable voters based on psychological insights gleaned from online data. Even if you are relaxed about analytics companies gaming the political process, you may be more bothered about the effect on your wallet: researchers at the Polytechnic University of Catalonia have already found evidence that some online retailers use profiling to discriminate against certain customers. If you’re identified as a high-value shopper, you’re likely to be steered towards more expensive products, or even charged more than other visitors for the same item. And that’s just the start of it. Experts warn that, in the future, your online activity could be taken into consideration when you apply for a loan – or for a job. That’s troubling, not least because profiling involves a large element of assumption and inference. Something as innocent as searching for a medical condition – even out of mere curiosity – could cause your insurance premiums to rocket, and you’ll never know why. Even if you’ve nothing to hide, therefore, it may be wise to minimise your exposure to online tracking. Here’s how some of the biggest names on the web spy on you – and how to protect your privacy. Amazon Facebook Twitter Pinterest Pressing the mute button on top of Amazon’s Echo voice assistant will temporarily stop it from recording audio. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian Amazon has a disconcerting habit of following you around the web. Spend a few minutes browsing its catalogue for a new crepe pan, and you might find that the next site you visit is mysteriously festooned with ads for cookware. Thankfully, Amazon gives you an easy way to opt out of being tracked in this way. Simply click on “Your Account” from the Amazon homepage, then scroll down to “Advertising Preferences”: here you’ll see the option to disable personalised ads. Note that since this feature relies on cookies, it will only take effect in the browser you’re currently using. Under “Advertising Preferences”, you’ll also see the option to view and manage your browsing history; from here you can disable tracking altogether, or remove individual items from your Amazon history. That could be useful if you’re shopping for a gift, or if you’ve been browsing unfashionable items you’d rather not be reminded of. What about Amazon’s voice assistant devices? If you’ve got an Amazon Echo in your home, you might be concerned about it listening in on private conversations. Rest assured, the Echo doesn’t record anything it hears until you address it with the appropriate “wake word” (normally “Alexa”). Whatever you say next is relayed to Amazon, where it’s processed and stored, but you can wipe this data at any time – you’ll find the option to do so in Amazon’s “Manage Your Content and Devices” settings. To ensure that Alexa can’t be woken up even by accident, you can also press the mute button on the top of the Echo to temporarily disable the microphone; just press it again to turn it back on. It’s worth noting, however, that the Echo’s software updates automatically, so its behaviour could change at any time. We’ll be keeping a sharp eye out for any updates that could compromise your privacy. Apple Facebook Twitter Pinterest The macOS operating system passes your search terms on to Apple. Photograph: Graeme Robertson for the Guardian iPhones and iPads collect a lot of data about you, and it’s accessible not just to Apple but to third-party apps too. The “Privacy” section in the iOS Settings app gives you an overview of what’s being collected, and lets you disable various data-sharing features. One particular thing to note is that if you’re carrying an iPhone around in your pocket, it will be constantly keeping track of your location, and potentially sharing it. You can easily tell it not to, though: in the Settings app, tap on “Privacy” > “Location Services” and select which apps should have access to your GPS data. You can also disable system services such as “Frequent Locations”, or disable location services altogether – though this means that apps like Apple Maps won’t work. It’s a similar situation for Mac users. The macOS system uses network connections to work out where in the world your computer is located, and this information can be shared with applications and websites. You can manage this from “System Preferences” > “Security & Privacy”. Another privacy concern for macOS users is the fact that every time you search for something in Spotlight, your search terms are passed on to Apple, so the company’s servers can provide suggested links to online sources. You can disable this feature by opening “System Preferences” > “Spotlight” and unticking the box for “Spotlight Suggestions”. Finally, keep an eye on your webcam, as malware can allow hackers to literally spy on you via your Mac’s built-in camera. If the light comes on unexpectedly, that means someone’s watching you; for complete peace of mind, you can always cover the camera with opaque tape. Consider also going to “System Preferences” > “Sound” and disabling the internal microphone, to ensure no one’s eavesdropping on your conversations. Facebook Facebook Twitter Pinterest Facebook: you might decide the safest option is not to have an account. Photograph: Carl Court/Getty Images You’ve probably handed plenty of personal information to Facebook yourself – but the social network also tracks your visits to other websites to build up a scarily detailed profile of your lifestyle and interests. This information is mostly used for targeting ads, but it could be turned to other purposes in the future. Facebook is quite open about the information it collects. When you see an ad on your timeline, you can always click the drop-down menu at its top right and select “Why am I seeing this?” to discover why Facebook chose to show you an ad for a smartphone, rather than one for scented soap. For a fuller explanation of what Facebook knows about you, go to the “Settings” page and click “Adverts” to inspect your advertising profile. If there are any mistakes here, or advertisers you don’t want to hear from, they can be removed or blocked with a click. The creepy part is that, by default, Facebook’s targeted ads don’t appear only in Facebook itself. Facebook uses cookies to follow your profile on to other websites and, like Amazon, ensure that you see the ads it wants you to. You can disable this behaviour from the advert preferences page: under “Advert settings” you’ll see a rather awkwardly phrased setting for “Ads on apps and websites off of the Facebook Companies”. Set this to “No” and you should regain a degree of online anonymity. Of course, this doesn’t mean that Facebook isn’t still profiling you: there’s sadly no easy way to stop it collecting information. Your best bet is to turn to the measures described in “The internet”, below, such as enabling “Do Not Track” in your browser, specifically opting out or installing an anti-tracking browser extension. Or, of course, you may decide it’s safest just to delete your Facebook account. Google Facebook Twitter Pinterest Google’s My Activity page allows you to view your entire browsing history. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian Most of us use Google services every day, and as a result the web giant knows a huge amount about our movements and interests. You can find out everything it’s learned about you at myaccount.google.com. Your data is all set out in an impressively forthright way; the only problem is, there’s so much information to work through that it can be bewildering to navigate. One section that’s worth your attention is “Manage your Google activity”. Here you’ll find Google’s activity controls, which let you disable various types of data collection. For example, you can tell Google not to log your Chrome browsing history and activity, to stop tracking your location and to desist from keeping records of any voice commands you might issue. Turning these features off can make Google services less smart, but you might consider that a price worth paying. For a closer look at the information Google’s been collecting on you lately, click on “My activity”. This brings up a timeline showing all of your searches, webpage visits, Android app activity and so forth. Seeing your digital life laid bare like this can be pretty unnerving: if there’s something you’d prefer Google to forget, simply click on the menu icon to its right and delete. If you want to thoroughly inspect everything Google knows about you, you can even download a comprehensive archive of personal information by clicking on “Control your content” > “Download your data”. Be warned, though, this archive can be huge: the default settings include all the emails in your Gmail account, and any videos you may have uploaded to YouTube. If you want to limit the information you share with Google in the future, the easiest way is simply to use it less. For example, try the privacy-focused search engine at duckduckgo.com, and use an alternative browser such as Firefox. Microsoft Windows 10’s “telemetry” features automatically capture all sorts of information about what you’re doing on your PC, and send it back to Microsoft. The company insists that this information is only used to improve Windows, but it can still feel like a violation. The recent “Creators Update” to Windows 10 prompts you to review your privacy settings as part of the update process, but you can check and change your settings at any time: simply open the Windows 10 Settings app and click on “Privacy”. You’ll find no fewer than 18 pages of configuration options, covering everything from personalised advertising to location services. There are a few settings you might particularly want to check. One feature of Windows 10 that may be cause for concern is the way it tracks everything you type – yes, everything – and shares it with Microsoft. This is supposed to help the operating system learn the way you work, but if the idea makes you shudder, you can disable it under “Speech, inking and typing”. Under “Feedback & diagnostics”, meanwhile, you can choose how much diagnostic information gets periodically sent back to Microsoft. A full report includes details of which applications you’ve been using and which websites you’ve been visiting, so you might prefer to switch to the more limited basic setting. You can also manage the information that Microsoft already knows about you by visiting the Privacy Dashboard at account.microsoft.com/privacy. While not strictly a privacy issue, another controversial aspect of Windows 10 is the inclusion of ads in the user interface. To remove unwanted ads from the Start menu, go to “Settings” > “Personalisation” > “Start” and disable “Occasionally show suggestions in Start”. To stop Microsoft advertising its OneDrive cloud storage service, open File Explorer, then select “View” > “Options” > “Change folder and search options”, click on the “View” tab, and untick “Show sync provider notifications”. The internet Facebook Twitter Pinterest Google Chrome, like most major browsers, has options to disable tracking. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian All right, it’s an exaggeration to say that the internet as a whole is spying on you. But there are a hell of a lot of companies out there keeping tabs on your online activity. The motivation normally comes down to filthy lucre – tracking your interests helps them push relevant ads your way, and to be fair you might prefer those to irrelevant ones. If you’d rather not be tracked, one step you can immediately take is to enable the “do not track” feature in your browser. Yes, it’s that simple: every major web browser has the capability to tell websites that you don’t want to be followed – you can find more details at donottrack.us. The only problem with this system is that compliance is completely optional, so websites that want to follow you still can. Another thing you can do is visit youradchoices.com, a site that checks your browser for “tracking cookies” from more than 100 companies. You can disable individual cookies, or turn off all behavioural advertising with a single click. After this, you’ll still see ads, but they won’t be customised to your interests any more. A more drastic solution is to configure your browser to reject third-party cookies – that is, cookies that connect to a site other than the one you’re currently browsing. However, this can cause problems if, for example, a site uses embedded content from elsewhere on the web. A safer option is to use a tool such as Ghostery ; this free browser extension can block tracking cookies from more than 4,500 companies, while letting you selectively enable cross-site content. It’s a pain that this should be necessary, but if you don’t want your personal information to be shared around online, it’s a precaution worth taking.

She's back in her hometown to give a presentation as part of Innovation Week. (Krissy Holmes/CBC) Related Stories Schools need better computer science education, group says External Links Innovation Week (Note: CBC does not endorse and is not responsible for the content of external links.) A St. John's woman is making a name for herself in California's Silicon Valley as an executive with Google. 'People who come there are very smart, engaged and are there because they want to make an impact.' - Catherine Courage Catherine Courage is the vice-president of ads and commerce user experience at the corporation, and in 2013 was named one of the top women of influence by the Silicon Valley Business Journal. She's back in her hometown as a special guest speaker for Accelerating Innovation, a weeklong event where innovators, startups and other stakeholders share ideas on how to improve innovation in Newfoundland and Labrador. The Googleplex corporate headquarters complex of Google and its parent company Alphabet in Mountain View, Calif. (Wikipedia) Courage, who has a master's degree in applied sciences from the University of Toronto, said she applied for the job at Google despite some worry that she was in over her head. "Sometimes you do have those moments of self-doubt," she told the St. John's Morning Show. "But when you feel that sense of doubt or fear, it's actually a good thing and you have to embrace it." As a woman working in an industry typically dominated by men, Courage attributes her success to having strong female figures in her life when she was growing up, such as her mother and three aunts, who were all highly educated and successful. Catherine Courage and others take part in a panel at the Sheraton Hotel in St. John's as part of Innovation Week 2017. (Twitter/@msimms28) Until recently, she never focused on the fact that she was a woman, but now that she's in a leadership position she feels more of a responsibility to encourage other young women to get involved in the tech industry. "I would absolutely encourage any young female to really explore the tech sector. It's a great career," she said.  "It's exciting. There are a lot of learning opportunities. Typically they have great benefits, compensation, and lots of flexibility for people who want to have families." Newfoundland values Courage said working for Google is a challenging but very rewarding experience, as the company gives their employees a great deal of flexibility when it comes to pursuing ideas. She said growing up in Newfoundland has given her an approach that progressive companies like Google deeply value. "When I think about being a Newfoundlander I think we're very human and I think we're very focused on people," she said. "That's really allowed me to excel as a good manager because I'm not just thinking about the tasks and the process and speed. I really try and think about the people I work with, and I think that goes a long way." Inside the Googleplex building. Catherine Courage says the company embraces an ethic of working hard and playing hard. She said her peers at Google think of her home province as an "exotic" place that they've heard of through things like the Fogo Island Inn and the Come From Away musical. Work hard, play hard Despite what many people think, Courage said there's much more to working at a giant tech company than playing ping pong or working while sitting on beanbag chairs. "There is a lot of fun, I will say. They do a great job of taking care of their employees and making it a very fun and engaging environment," she said. "The flip side of that is a lot of hard work. People who come there are very smart, engaged and they are there because they want to make an impact."   With files from Krissy Holmes Report Typo or Error Send Feedback To encourage thoughtful and respectful conversations, first and last names will appear with each submission to CBC/Radio-Canada's online communities (except in children and youth-oriented communities).

It’s moving like a slug compared to Samsung’s Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow roll out for the Galaxy Note 4 but we expect it to pick up speed in the weeks ahead. We expect the Galaxy Note 4 to remain on Marshmallow. We haven’t seen anyone point to a Nougat release. At least not yet. Features Thanks to these roll outs, we know what the Samsung Galaxy Note 4 Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow update looks like.

Samsung’s Galaxy Tab S2 Android 6.0.1 update has started to roll out. The upgrade rolling out right now in Germany for the 9-inch model. It brings well-known Marshmallow features and it also brings a multi-user mode. This mode allows you to create separate accounts for family members and friends. A few more notes: The Galaxy Tab S2 9-inch Marshmallow update is also pushing for the 4G model in the Netherlands. The Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow update is now rolling out for the 8-inch Galaxy Tab S2 in the United Kingdom. The update is similar to the upgrade for the larger version. Samsung’s Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow update is also rolling out to the Galaxy Tab S2 on Rogers in Canada and Verizon in the United States. The AT&T Galaxy Tab S2 Marshmallow update is rolling out right now. T-Mobile is also rolling out a Galaxy Tab S2 Marshmallow update in the United States. The update should be available OTA right now. Verizon is also now rolling out a Galaxy Tab E 8.0 Marshmallow update. It’s similar to the other Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow updates for Big Red and those who own this relatively new tablet are encouraged to check for the update right now. Android Marshmallow is also rolling out the Samsung Galaxy Tab S 8.4. The update is currently available for the Wi-Fi model in Europe. As for the rest of Samsung’s tablet line, the Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow update is also rolling out for the first time to the Galaxy Tab A. The update is pushing out in France to the 9.7-inch Wi-Fi only variant. It’s also pushing out in Australia to the 8-inch Wi-Fi model. The update is a little over 1GB in size and it brings enhancements and new features to the slate. U.S. Cellular’s also started rolling out the Samsung Galaxy S 10.5 Android Marshmallow update after a long wait. Samsung April Security Update Google is rolling out April security updates to its Nexus and Pixel devices and Samsung is following suit with April security updates of its own. The Samsung April security patch is rolling out to several Nougat-powered devices (Galaxy S7, Galaxy S7 Edge, and more) and it’s also hitting devices powered by Android Marshmallow. In the United States, T-Mobile recently rolled out the April security patch to the Galaxy Note 4 and the Galaxy Note Edge, two devices that will almost certainly stay on Android 6.0.1.   If you’re interested in the specific changes, take a look at the patch notes on the company’s website. The latest patch delivers key patches from Samsung and Google. Android Nougat Update As we’ve noted, the Samsung Galaxy Marshmallow roll out has been joined by Samsung’s new Android 7.0 Nougat update. The company’s rolling out Galaxy S7 Nougat updates, Galaxy S6 Nougat updates, Galaxy Note 5 Nougat updates, and others. Samsung’s promised several Nougat updates in the first half of 2017 and we expect all of these upgrades to deliver new features, tweaks and fixes for lingering Marshmallow issues. For more information on the Android Marshmallow’s successor, take a look at our Samsung Galaxy Android Nougat roundup and our Android Nougat walkthrough. Samsung’s Android Nougat update will bump devices from Android 6.0.1 to Android 7.0. It’s not clear when or if Samsung will bump its devices to Android 7.1.1, the most up-t0-date version of Nougat. If you own a Galaxy S7 or Galaxy S7 Edge, we’ve put together a guide that will take you through the most important things to know about your update. If you own a Galaxy S6 or Galaxy Note 5, we’ve put together guides that will take you through the most exciting things about their release. 3 Reasons Not to Install Galaxy S7 Nougat & 8 Reasons You Should Install Nougat If You Want Better Security   1 / 11 Let's start with some basics. If you value your security, and most of you probably do, you'll want to think about installing the Galaxy S7 Nougat update soon after it arrives for your device.  Every month, Google and Samsung release important security patches for Android devices. The Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Android Nougat updates should bring the latest security patches to your device. Samsung's initial batch of Galaxy S7 Nougat updates delivered the company's January security update while upcoming updates could deliver the patches from the February security update. You can read more about their contents on Samsung's website.  If you failed to download or receive an older security update (December, November, etc), the patches from those updates might be baked into your version of Nougat. If not, you might be forced to install them manually before you can download Nougat.  On top of the patches, Samsung's Galaxy S7 Nougat update brings Samsung Pass, a way to secure your identity using biometric data rather than entering your password or ID.  Samsung Pass is like a master key for your various logins and it relies on Galaxy S7's fingerprint scanner. The biometric data is encrypted and stored safely by Samsung Knox.   1 / 11 364 Responses 01/06/2016 Ben Reply i dont see any difference in this version and what I am currently running on my S^ which I just got a few days ago. The hype and the hype over a few stupid changes is crazy. You guys in the media have to stop making things bigger than what they are, When a MAJOR change occurs, then hype and push it. Marshmallow is not a big deal. 01/12/2016 mnet Reply Marshmallow is hug Ben. It is huge because of the features you will get to control app permissions. The “wild west” days of Android apps with their crazy permissions is coming to an end. If you have not discovered all the features of 6.0 yet its because you have not looked into what is really there but instead troll the web. 03/05/2017 Sincose Line Reply Marshmallow is not working fine for many of the Samsung variants but of course after updating to Marshmallow from Lollipop, battery does not work as good as on Lollipop.

This update is about the marshmallow 6.0.1 and you must be talking about marshmallow 6.0 04/18/2016 William Ernst Reply The update sucks if you have an S5, as it has eliminated the feature that lets you transfer applications to the SD card 05/19/2016 Jamario Souza Reply The worst thing after this update is that I simply lost LTE connection. Only acces 3G. With Android 5 I could manage Network Band and select my prefered band, but now I have no access to it. In March it updated to Android 6.0, this month it updated to 6.0.1 and the shit continues. I cannot unlock phone using fingerprint after rebooting phone. It seems to me that Android M has taken a step backwards with my device.

Here’s what I’ve been doing>> USA Jobs Resort 04/14/2016 Robert Reply I disagree. I’ve had my S6 for several months on Lollipop, finally got the update to Marshmallow from Verizon a couple weeks ago and I’m really enjoying it. My S6 has much better battery life and it performs much better in benchmarks and normal use. It’s smoother (not as laggy), apps load faster, messaging is more streamlined (no more waiting to take and send pics through text), and total control of app permissions (finally). Marshmallow is a major update and I couldn’t be happier with it. It’s just a shame it took so long to actually get it. 06/21/2016 laurarussell532 Reply I found a great site that focuses on stay at home mom’s complete guide to gaining a serious amount of money in very little time.

If it’s not resolved within the two year update I’m moving to iOS. I rather deal with a company that updates regular and is more restrictive about what you can have than a company that takes months and months to update their devices. 01/11/2016 Taha Reply Chuck. Buying a nexus gives you instant apple style hardware and software updates. Cheers 01/12/2016 mnet Reply I agree with you to a point. But you have to ask yourself are you looking for updates for the sake of just getting something “new”? Most updates are minor, granted 6.0 is no minor update.

I think that it’s going to be another couple of months before I see it on my Note 4. But some great additions I didn’t expect…they’ve added scrolling screenshot functionality & the Edge is, at last amazing with half screen functionality and loads upon loads of Edge improvements. Battery life seems far better. I haven’t really dug in to fund everything yet, but so far as great improvement.

Had the S3, Note 10.1 (2012) and now Note 4 and always the same with lack of updates or extremely slow to update. Samsung needs to stop making dozens of devices with then dozens of variants of the same device! This is why they can’t update in a timely manner. If Google and Apple can make their device line up simple then so can Samsung! If Apple and Google can bypass carriers for updates and send them direct to users then so can Samsung. Until Samsung smartens up, they have lost me as a customer! Next phone will either be a Google Nexus device or (I hate to say and even think it but) iOS. I left Apple for Android but Google hates sd cards, all other manufacturers are slow to update. It’s ridiculous! Also the fact Samsung is removing the “adoptable storage” feature from their Android 6.0.1 updates is ridiculous! It’s a Google feature and Samsung and LG should have no right to remove/disable it. Give us the choice FFS! F U SAMDUNG! 02/25/2016 Too Squat Reply Note 4 owner…I think this is my last Samsung. I bought it because of the pen. Used to be an HTC buyer, they converted me to Android.

This is like reading the same thing over and over and over again. 4 months into Marshmellow and barely any devices have recieved it. Pathetic. Carriers suck with the added bloatware but it shouldn’t be this damn complicated. The real reason for the wait, S7 and S7 Edge. Gotta make sure as many people buy the latest and greatest before taking care of their actual customers first. Yes, its a business but wow…get the ball rolling Samsung or you’ll be losing about 100 people I know who’d love to try Apple.

Sir….. 02/29/2016 ThisGuyEntitledMuch Reply wow 02/29/2016 Charles Reply To the coders, thanks and all that… I’m sure that you busted a gut over this thing. but, Marshmallow doesn’t appear to be worth the risk of bricking your phone. You got Lollipop working ok.. You even dumped out a security patch. It works… It works well… The phone works as advertised. 6.0 and/or 6.0.1 for all the fanfare and hooplah… just doesn’t seem like it’s worth the risk. Maybe after 6.0.1 gets debugged… and/or maybe a 6.0.2 rolls out – or, maybe after the security fixes for it hit the bricks… It’ll be mature to a point where it’ll install and do what it’s supposed to do without doing any harm…. That could be a year away. Hell, there is even super hype blurting out over Android N… – and, they haven’t delivered 6.0.1… Why not talk about O and P while you’re at it…. There are still a lot of un-used letters in the alphabet. There is little or no talk about a USA release… thank god. It has to start out in S. Korea… and work its way west thru Bangladesh and Botswana. Sure, fine… brick pygmy phones if you have to. Don’t release the >1Gb bloat code here – until it works… It doesn’t even have to deliver the BS hype… just don’t brick my phone. and, If at all possible – don’t gut any useful functionality – that I had in Lollipop… We all know BS when we hear it. We know it won’t do all that you say it will do…. In short.. Do no harm… Don’t release an OS that is worse than the one we got. 02/29/2016 Bharath Reply Any chance of Touchwiz update on note 4? 03/01/2016 Young_Android_Runner Reply 29Feb2016 > Marshmallow isn’t here yet but we’re already hearing about a potential successor to the Marshmallow update Huh?

Like, now I cannot define the pattern of vibration when a phone rings. Bummer. I liked that. Second, while waking up the phone, the screen-light come on really slowly. Third, the Settings aren’t all same like Galaxy S7. There is no triple-press home button for one-hand use feature. Fourth, Galaxy Labs is absent. Oh well, can’t think of more at the moment. There are many more, though. Disappointing, Samsung.

Google search for your correct way of entering recovery. Then when you do get there, use volume keys as directionals to select clearing system cache. OK that by the power key.

Samsuck is notorious for sending out upgrades late, thanks to their crappy touchwhiz garbage. They have to make sure the newest OS is working with that and thus it takes the longest. This is my first and last samsuck device, not only because of late OS updates (and N is right around the corner), but also because of their rapid charging mode. It wears out their batteries and people have to go buy new ones after about a year. My iPhone 5 that I gave my wife, I bought at launch and it is still working flawlessly on the same battery. My samsuck nope 4 is not holding the charge it once did because of its battery issue. I won’t be buying a new battery, however, I will be buying a new phone. And if I have to sell a kidney to afford and iPhone then so be it. 03/22/2016 Mathew Bolles Reply I received my update on my US Cellular S6 two days ago. It’s working flawlessly and full of all the promised upgrades and features. 03/24/2016 Preston Reply Note 5 on Sprint is getting it now. 03/24/2016 Jack Reply Receiving marshmallow from Sprint on my s6 edge+ now! 03/24/2016 Charles Reply About the only thing you can say about the Big Marshmallow Roll Out – is that it’s worth every penny ya paid for it. From what I can tell…. No one involved in the process seems to know what the process is. Supposedly, it is really rolling out some where… Botswana… Bangladesh… the Punjab in India. It is rolling of obscure tele-cos… with 10s of 100s of customers… The smaller the better. No projected or predicted or implied delivery dates have been met – any where. Those that got it – and, it worked – don’t seem to have a problem with it… even if it comes with its own completely new set of anomalies. Those that got it and it bricked their devices… simply disappear into non-digital existence. There seems to be some people that may or may not have it… that just love it to death. They are others seeing it as a cure for imagined ills. Then their are a few walking wounded that actually did get it… And, it didn’t deliver as promised. Bottom Line…. So far, it’s a huge non-event… and, that may be the good news… Some devices are skipping this promised land – for the next new – not quite there – version N. Which one must assume will be as nebulous as the nearly existent Marshmallow. This would all be a horrible fate if there was a problem with Lollipop to begin with. Fortunately, Lollipop isn’t all that bad. These promised improvements are like chasing mirages in the dessert… That can be a real problem if you are dying of thirst. The problem for the Android Overlords is that they can’t get any one thirsty for the new products…. Rumors, innuendos, and power of suggestion will only get you – but, so far. Plus, if you deliver one of these half-baked products – and, it bricks millions of devices… that a hell-of-a-lot of negative advertisement to get over. So, the latest update on the update… is that it is still kind of there but not there. No carrier has a completed roll out for all their devices. No device manufacturer has a completed roll out for all their makes and models on all carriers. There isn’t even a single device that is up and running on all carriers. It’s just one very specific make, model, – possibly even a specific block of serial numbers – within a model… pops up with a roll out on – one very specific carrier – usually some where outside the US. This is touted as progress…. Where – in comparison – Apple pulls a roll out and gets 80% of their products updated in a month… Still, ya have to admit…. Marshmallow is worth every penny ya paid for it. 03/24/2016 Jeffrey Gohlke Reply US Cellular S6 updated to 6.0.1 today 3-24-16 03/24/2016 Thersathomas Reply 203=1m­­­­­­­­­y neigh­­­­­­­­­bor’s mo­­­­­­­­­m m­­­­­­­­­akes $80 /h­­­­­­­­­r o­­­­­­­­­n th­­­­­­­­­e int­­­­­­­­­ernet .

If Wi-Fi is switched on, only the Play Store does not work. The Play Store works fine on LTE. All other Wi-Fi functions work fine. So I reset my device twice but no improvement. I see this problem happens to other phones at various times but I don’t see a good solution. 03/29/2016 Erik Reply I’ve experienced the same except the problem persists to apps like Pandora and youtube, however my browser app runs the website versions absolutely fine.

Never will I buy a Samsung and it seems they have lost thousands of customers. They told me to do a soft reset 1st. 2nd put phone on safe mode. I did all. When in safe mode I went into play store updated apps. Went into maps and cloud. I to lost ability to connect to WiFi if on 4G. Doing this fixed it.

I am sick and tired of those developers who cannot get on the ball and get our devices updated. OS N is already coming out! And STILL no Marshmallow for my Thai version Note 4??? What is the hold up, samsung??!?!?! Get on the ball, or hire some competent developers to get that update to everyone. This is ridiculous! 03/28/2016 Stan Reply I don’t think it’s too much too ask that Verizon, who are a multi-billion dollar empire, who rushed to be the first US player to update marshallow to Samsung’s phones ensure a safe install. The update BRICKED MY PHONE by not allowing it to charge. Even using a new battery didn’t work! I Have safely updated many phones and computers a million different ways. NEVER have I ever had an update DESTROY A device, let alone an $800 phone! The super messed up part is the take NO accountability for releasing software that can damage your phone. Why do you think people are migrating in DROVES to T Mobil? Me being one…**** Verizon and hope they choke the thousands of dollars I’ve thrown their Way!

Or clear all cache and reboot. 03/29/2016 Marcus Reply I just recently updated my Sprint Galaxy Note 4 to android marshmallow 6.0.1, I also have updated another phone on my account to the Galaxy S7 edge the S7 running 6.9.1 is good so far as expected. However the update to 6.0.1 on the note 4 has a few issues so far, after the upgrade all my Bluetooth connections were wiped out and reconnecting is an issue because I have to reboot the phone and restart the headset 1 or 2 times before the phone sees the headset, I also found that one of tge greatest additions in marshmallows has been left out of the update and that is the theme engine, I mean really what sense does it make to leave out one of the best features, please put out an update that adds this feature back. Leaving out a major update at this stage of the game makes no sense at all. Guy’s get it fixed and get it right. 03/30/2016 Jay Reply Just got the 6.0.1 on my notes 5 sm – n920g 03/30/2016 Pamela Huff Reply My us cellular s6 edge plus updated to marshmallow a couple of weeks ago and I love it. Definitely some edge screen improvements but by far the most useful is having Google now right on top, no matter what page you’re on. 03/30/2016 Charles Reply As roll outs go… this is like standing in the middle of a turtle stampede. Sure, no one wants to rush anything… Why risk bricking your phone? The customers didn’t demand this. The customers aren’t really feeling the burn here… Yet, the vaguest reference of a siting in the most obscure of countries and the smallest of carriers – gets absurd pronouncements. It’ll happen when it happens. About the only good thing you can say about it – is – that it’s worth every penny you paid for it. 04/09/2016 sarcasticdave94 Reply Here’s my 2¢. I’m glad my Note 4 got it as it is an update, it looks OK and works. I don’t like that Sammy took away the ability to move apps to the SD card and that I’ve gotta put the password in every time I reboot the phone. Other methods like fingerprint scan won’t work till after it’s fully rebooted via entering the password. I don’t think I’ve got extra emoji or wherever the modified battery saver was. It did come with a generous supply of Sprint/TouchWiz bloat as usual, but maybe a bit lighter by a few percentage points. I’m glad I didn’t pay for it though. And the next device for me will be called Nexus. See what you get for 2¢. :-P 03/30/2016 Wilson Reply After running the new update my S6 now randomly re-starts itself and I would say roughly half the phone calls are going directly to voicemail. The phone does not ring when this happens. What can be done to correct this? – Thank you. 03/31/2016 Jennifer Stam Reply Mine is doing the same! Frustrating!

Too many issues to mention here. My phone is messed up! 03/31/2016 Charles Reply Here we are at the close of yet another month… March 31 – with Marshmallow market share resting comfortably at 2.3%… The pundits milestones fall by the wayside once again. and, They refuse to hold silence on their accolades for 6.0.1 – that barely exists… – and, where it does exist – there is no small amount of nashing of teeth. The pundits sell great snake oil…. btw… And, what’s wrong with snake oil – you might say. When was the last time you saw a squeaky snake? oh… well… There is always April – then May – then June…. Maybe some country some where with a sizable telecom – will roll this thing out and get it to work. Buyer be ware… If you got it “on” your new device – don’t panic… it’ll probably work just fine. Upgrading older devices – is always a bit of a crap shoot. If you bought older legacy hardware and update prior to loading your old apps…. that might work ok, too.. Marshmallow isn’t all that evil… It just can’t cope with all the possible combinations of footprints left over from old OS’s and legacy apps. Nothing ever has. Nothing ever will. The glacial roll out is probably a blessing – in that it is sparing you from the infinite new anomalies that you will encounter… The purported enhancements/improvements – may – or, may not – work as advertised. but, At least, you have gotten used to the quirks in your current device. Why suffer the trials and tribulations of different quirks – whilst Beta testing the lasted flavor. I guess that I long for the daze when one could stone false prophets. Back in the good ole daze, if the prophet spoke and got it wrong – they took him out to the gates of the city and stoned him… Not much of a retirement plan… But, it really cut down on people making idiot claims and speculations. 03/31/2016 Charles Reply Verizon has already inflicted/infected the Samsung Galaxy Note 5 users with Marshmallow…. Batteries dying… WiFi croaking… no access to the AppStore… BlueTooth disconnecting…. Who will be the next victim? Will they bless the 6s class? What did they ever do the Verizon… other than subscribe. The good news here – is – that as glacial as Android is with the updates, they aren’t all that essential. The updates sell features that you have never had… you are being told that you want them. Also… it’s great that it’s free… The update is worth every penny that you paid for it. So – not getting something that you don’t need and didn’t ask for – for money that you never paid… isn’t all that bad of a deal… Then Verizon steps in with its non-value added contribution. This slows the process even further. By the time Verizon is finished bloating the code, even more lettered releases appear on the horizon… N, O, P, etc. Which may displace the much exalted M – all together… and, Is that bad? You are still not paying for it. You still didn’t ask for it. You still don’t need it. So, does it ever matter, which version of the next shiny new OS that you aren’t actually getting? The hype seems totally unaffected. These are the same guys that barely got KitKat and Lolipop to stop coughing up blood… and, those two combined only pulled 37% of the market share for Samsung. Marshmallow is languishing at 2.3% – after 4 months. This is almost as much fun to watch as MicroSloth WinWoes rolling out their free WinWoes Tin…. 03/31/2016 Amy Sweet Reply Did the Marshmallow update and I can no longer lock my phone.

My update was just short of 1.4 GB. It has improved my Note by making it feel smoother and more intuitive. It seems to also be a bit lighter as in not so bloated, but I’m unable to confirm that as a fact. The only area I’m disappointed, and it’s a great disservice to us owners in my opinion, I no longer can move apps to the SD card. It’s not even accessable, as in moving apps to it, unless I’m missing something. This in my opinion is a real failure by Sammy. It just confirms my previous plan to go Nexus next time around. 04/09/2016 sarcasticdave94 Reply Sorry for my redundancy at the end there. 04/09/2016 sarcasticdave94 Reply OK so there actually IS a way to transfer files from phone memory to a mounted SD card.

Learn where you do this on your particular phone as I don’t know about all is of them. I do know I did this to my Sammy Note 4 on Sprint and it helped with crashing apps after updating. Clear all cache. Then reboot. See if it helps. Hint: some devices have a setting menu for this, others you shut off the phone then get to the restore screen to clear cache.

So upset, and there’s nothing anyone can seem to do about it. 04/14/2016 Charbel Geagea Reply I live in lebanon and I’m not getting touchwiz 6.0 and marshmallow on my s6 04/15/2016 lsv87 Reply I have Galaxy S6 Edge, marshmallow is awesome for DOZE and saving battery but I have a MAJOR gripe with lockscreen security. Before, switching back and forth between fingerprint and nothing was super easy. Use fingerprints to identify, choose none, that’s it. Now it is fricken ridiculous and annoying as hell cause it asks for your backup password or code, then you select none, then it ALWAYS says cancel/delete fingerprints/keep fingerprints, even if you select keep fingerprints it asks for you to create a backup passcode TWICE which you already have!!!!!!!!!!!!! Why would they do this absolute nonsense?????????? 04/15/2016 Cindi Riggins Reply The update ruined my phone. Can’t use Maps or update apps on WiFi. Have s6 and have had 3 phones.

Why cant we have an option to change from marshmallow. new color sucks , hurts my eyes and it is so bight in the dark.

Size: 1474.19 MB Version: N915PVPU4DPD1/N915PSPT4DPD1/N915PVPU4DPD1 · OS upgrade – Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow · To get the best from your device, please keep your phone up to date and regularly check for software updates. ※ Fingerprints are securely protected. An alternative unlock method (pattern, PIN, or password) is required to add fingerprints. ※ Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow does not support the Decrypt device function. If your mobile device is encrypted, encryption cannot be disabled after upgrading. If you want encryption to be disabled after upgrading, it must be disabled before you upgrade your device. To disable encryption go to Settings – Lock screen and security – Other security settings, then select Decrypt device. ※ If the Samsung Gear or Gear Fit Manager app does not work normally after this upgrade, uninstall the app, then install the latest version. This will reset your Gear to factory default settings and all data on your Gear will be erased. ※ Some apps that were installed via the Lollipop OS may need to be updated after upgrading to the Marshmallow OS. Go to Galaxy Apps or Play Store to update apps. 04/21/2016 Charles Reply Marshmallow… 6.0.1 – over hyped… bloated… non-plused…. overall = not bad. For a Samsung Galaxy s6 edge+ / with Verizon, it’s not all that bad. My phone did not brick. My phone is not coughing up blood. The battery does not die… though – I’m not quite sure that the super enhanced improvement is there… The battery is doing ok.. not noticeably worse. The graphic depiction of projected duration is longer… I haven’t tried running it out to 12 hours yet… I don’t run enough BlueTooth peripherals to show a problem… It says its still there… I’m taking it at its word. The WiFi… may have had a problem – or, not…. The home WiFi didn’t skip a beat. The historical archive of pre-existing connections did ok, too… Scanning for potential – new – WiFis could be a problem – or, not… it could just work differently. I’ve had to re-register on a couple of hubs… So far, no big deal. The phone does not get mysteriously hot… or, cold… It does not randomly buzz, vibrate, reboot – or, speak in tongues. All the apps seem to have made it. The app store(s) are still there… — there is a special permission for non-PlayStore apps… Click a button and the Amazon apps, etc… are good to go. The GPS is doing ok. It appears to be doing every bit as well as the old Lollipop… It may be a schoosh faster – snappier. Schoosh…is a technical digital device term = barely noticeable. The user interface “is” slightly different… enough to annoy… I can’t see much of a wow factor in it. The “edge” feature is different… (? better ?)… It’s only better if you were a heavy user to begin with. If you had never bonded to the feature to begin with.. this probably isn’t going to get you anymore involved. So far, Marshmallow is a benevolent improvement. It has done no noticeable harm. I haven’t lost any capabilities. It may even be an improvement – overall. I can’t dodge the feeling that I am missing something… with all the fanfare, there should be some sort of wow-factor that justifies all the hype… Sometimes ya just have to take it as it is… at least, it didn’t set me back. I would recommend it – if I only knew – why? 04/21/2016 Elle Reply Thank you 04/22/2016 Lisa Miceli Reply UGH…not a fan of the update at all.

Like the notifications are gone, developer options says “it doesn’t work for this user”, multitasking app doesn’t work, home and back button is the only one the works. Please help. 05/02/2016 Charles Reply Marshmallow 6.0.1 doesn’t seem to be all that bad…. Eventually, it automatically downloaded, then the annoying window was there for about a week every time you unlocked the screen. I finally consented for it to install… (Verizon Samsung Galaxy s6 edge plus) It blinked and buzzed… blinked some more.. went dark… for awhile… lit back up… did some more blinking… buzzed…. – after a bit, it looked like it was gunna actually do sumthun… The start screen lit up and it jingled its jangle… Then there was much flashing and an occasional buzz…. Once it finished convulsing, I went for a shut down, which it did. After a few moments of calm, I started it back up again. This time it started with less fan fare… about as quickly as Lollipop… It still wanted to do some tweaking… So, for the first half hour or so – it was clunky. Whatever the upgrade is – it takes time to digest. Over the following week or so… mileage has varied. Nothing bad… = but, no wow factor either. The battery usage is some where between psychotic and bewildering. Sometimes it predicts 8 hours… sometimes 3 days. There are weird slopes in the discharge curve, which effect the battery life prognostications. It may depend on signal strength, whether or not WiFi is enabled… and/or the strength of the WiFi signal.. It may also be effected by back ground app updates and the relative signal strengths during those processes.. and, There may be god knows what going on with apps optimizations. I have not let this thing go for 3 days and attained the promised duration… Before I could get 8hr, 12hrs… maybe 16 hrs… before an auto shut down. The best to date with marshmallow – I’ve gotten down to around 30 – 40% in power savings mode in about 22 hrs…. which is an improvement. I just don’t know if I can believe it. The digital services seem to be a bit snappier, quicker. No big difference with calls, gps, bluetooth, or WiFi… The searching and notifications of “new” WiFi signals may be different – but, the devices seems to connect to the old connections – ok. Basically, It hasn’t screwed much of anything up…. I have a very undemanding regimen for the device. What I had it doing – it still does, which is all I asked for. The new “can’t live without features” – eh… just not all that into them, yet. They aren’t bad… I bought the edge plus for the bigger screen – not so much for the edge technology. There’s nothing wrong with it… just wasn’t a big deal to begin with. With all the tapping, dragging, swiping, pinching, spreading… another way of doing the same stuff just adds another layer of confusion to the process… Still, the edge stuff works… The edge bar is bigger.. If I used it, it would be helpful. I can definitely say, that it was worth every penny I paid for it. It has done no damage. No data lost. No performance lost. No functionality lost. The learning curve for the new features is negligible. This positions the device to take advantage of new features in my existing apps. So far – so good…. It may be a benefit for battery usage and charging It will probably be better on my Samsung Galaxy Tab s2… 05/02/2016 Dustin Hall Reply My S6 updated to Marshmallow this morning and I’m getting all these errors: messaging app totally not working, laggy overload for every app, not recognizing my thumbprint, battery draining exceptionally fast.

I am an AT&T customer and like many of you I have been awaiting the Galaxy Note 4 Marshmallow update, but I have been waiting for it for very different reasons. Some owners of the phone may be waiting for it for the same reasons as well. Here is the problem:   Since the internet released that AT&T rolled out the Galaxy Note 4 Marshmallow update overseas, Google App vendors have been upgrading their softwares for the Note in anticipation of the Marshmallow Platform Update. If you are like me and you have been paying attention, these Google Play Apps update sometime 1 to 5 times weekly. With the updates being installed, the phone begins to freeze in certain applications. The phone may allow you close out the application so you may relaunch it, but in my instance this also means removing the battery cover (waiting for a time) and restarting the device. The reason I have now been told 5 times by AT&T tech reps is that the phone has not been updated with the software needed to support the updated Apps. So basically, between 1 to 6 times daily my device freezes.   Now, when I became upset about this was when I was told to upgrade to a new device, instead of being told when the Marshmallow Update would be released. Basically, my device is acting like it has a virus but is actually working as intended but is having a problem with software in Apps versus Platform issue. This meant I was being told upgrade a perfectly good working phone when there was nothing actually wrong with it. I got to thinking about how many AT&T customers are being told this, who may not be asking the right questions and I became even angrier, as they are throwing money at the company for a problem that is easily fixed:   1.       Either they indicate the Galaxy Note 4 is not going to be upgraded in the US, which causes vendors to stop notifying your phone to upgrade Apps. 2.       Or, they upgrade the phone to Marshmallow Software in the US post haste.   Basically I am outlining a very poor customer service issue. This is either due to AT&T’s negligence, Samsung’s negligence, or Googles. When you call to speak with anyone about this, they point the finger elsewhere as the problem. Warranty sent me a refurbished device to see if it will work better for me. It is on its way. I doubt it will, because of the issues I have been having. I thought I would pass this along to encourage all with a Galaxy Note 4 to call AT&T if you have been told to upgrade your device unnecessarily.   I upgrade, normally to a new phone 1x a year. As a present to myself on my birthday. This is the first time I did not upgrade as I was not happy with the lack of expandable memory in the Note 5. So I kept the phone. So now almost 2 years later, I am having all of these problems with a perfectly good phone and due to lack of SOFTWARE SUPPORT.  I hope me explaining this issues helps address your problem if you are having the same issue yourself. I encourage you to complain. Perhaps this will induce them to release the software, or finally release that they have no intention of doing so. Which also fixes the problem. 05/16/2016 Eric Johnson Reply Very nicely said. You brought out all the problems I was having. After I read your very long message, I was really with on most points. My final thought was I’m going to have to complain and complain. So like you said, complain about these issues were having. Maybe, just maybe that will work. Let’s hope that works. 05/11/2016 Shanna Hall Reply My Galaxy S6 Says That It Is Up to date But My Phone Is Still On lollipop. I haven’t even gotten the option to get marshmallow yet.

Most Samsung’s still run lollipop, while I run the new modern OS Android 7 which came via an OTA as soon as I got my lg nexus which runs pure Android not some dodgy rip off touch wiz crap. Samsung’s owners are some of the last to ever get updates even smaller brands already have marshmallow out of the box.

I understand all the tweets and wrinkles need to be ironed out but seriously I feel there is something being manipulated behind the AT&T curtain. 05/23/2016 Andy Reply Marshmallow on T-Mobile Galaxy S5 is downloading right now on my device! Stills says “T-Mobile Testing” on T-Mobile website though…so, probably a phased roll out. 05/23/2016 Charles Reply I would have preferred to have gone with Marshmallow in the Tab s2 first… The Galaxy s6 edge plus… is no big deal… At least, it didn’t go completely psychotic. The battery blather… – all the hype about improved battery performance – is a bit weird. The prognostications as to when it will die are all over the place. Sometimes it thinks that it can run for daze on the existing charge… sometimes just 6 to 8 hours… It “does” seem to re-charge faster. It doesn’t seem to be overheated when it does so. So far, it has been benevolently benign…. No lost data… No lock ups. It still works about like it did with Lolipop… I have noticed an occasional re-boot, on its own.. No boot loops. Some apps are a bit snappier and faster… some aren’t… some are the same. It could just be the calm before the storm… The chargers, the cables, the device hardware and OS have come into temporary alignment. We all know that it won’t last…. Sooner or later 5G will drop… = new hardware, new chargers and new cables… the OS will be gawd knows what by then. Enjoy it while it lasts. 05/26/2016 Jens Reply Woke up this morning to a 1500 plus mb download yay think I finally got the note 4 update from bell in Canada Hope it’s not just a security update. 05/26/2016 Steve Reply Got an update on Galaxy S6 last night. It updated fine and seemed to work ok. However, it appears to have disabled the ability to charge. By morning the plugged in phone had dropped to 0%. When unplugged it crashed and will no longer charge or boot. Told by Sprint tech they would have to factory reset. Sprint obviously doesn’t do any testing on their OTA software updates! 05/28/2016 Benjamin Reply I have the Note 4 (Through AT&T) and they have yet to release it on mine.

Samsung Galaxy series with Marshmalow OS are always my first choice in the current market. The features in its new updates are even more attractive than ever. Thanls for the info. 06/16/2016 Patrick Reply Yes AT&T sucks in many was, but as far as the Marshmallow update goes, Samsung has not released Marshmallow for some U.S models. I was anticipating my phone to update in June, but AT&T claims they have not received some Marshmallow updates from Samsung. June is not over, but AT&T will probably take their sweet time sending to phones under their umbrella. 06/16/2016 Alan Reply Samsung s stinks as does att. Note 5 June 16th still no update. I’m thinking about going back to Apple after a decade of this crap 06/19/2016 Phienyx Reply Have they fixed the feature where the LED blinks for unviewed notifications yet? … or is this still not been acknowledged or addressed? 06/23/2016 AJ Reply Samsung as a company should be so ashamed of how they manage all their device updates.. It is clear from that the postings on this article and hundreds like it that they are losing millions of phone sales to apple because of this reason alone. Make less models but keep them updated for min 5 years and you will have loyal supporters not careful ones.

Why not AT&T? What are AT&T’s plans for rolling out Marshmallow on their Note Edge models (SM-N915A)? 07/09/2016 Jonathan Reply Got the update on my WiFi only Tab S2 and it’s nothing but problems. One user is completely locked out because the fingerprint scanner won’t work and it will not recognize the backup password. The primary user keeps getting an “update security policy/set up fingerprint security” bullshit popup every single time the damn thing is unlocked, so have had to disable security on that user account. On top of that the tablet is often running a lot slower. So far I don’t see any benefits. 07/14/2016 strauss44 Reply Received my Android 6.0.1 today in Canada, via broadband cable from Shaw cable, then by inhouse WiFi to my Samsung Galaxy Tab A. It installed without incident and all apps appear to work fine. Only about six Apps needed updating, and did so on next rebot. All I can tell is essentially cosmetic changes. It does appear that browsers Opera and Firefox run slightly faster.

Mashmallow,go get toasted. You have caused my phone to overheat, slow its connection to almost anything, freeze so I can’t see my unlock pattern with the keyboard constantly coming up on my Homecreen. Finally the best bit, I always clean out old apps and crap to stop security issues and the CPU slowing down, and I no tech geek. So I should get more than five hours out of a battery charge, when all I doing is leaving it switched on? Samsung – Happy for you to send me a new phone. Otherwise I have no choice but to revive my old Galaxy 4. Kinda sux after paying it off over 12 months. 08/12/2016 Shereen Reply I did my update on Galaxy A5 and love the look.

Not sure what went wrong. I also noticed that when I go into my gallery it hangs before showing me the folders so I can view my photos. 08/13/2016 Mrticklesz Reply Its because they’re trying to sell their new products which is no any different than the note 4.. damn you samsung! 08/14/2016 Dee Reply Still no marshmallow for Galaxy Alpha… 08/18/2016 Dwan Sadler Reply Why didn’t the Sprin’ts Marshmallow update come with video calling? ATT, Verizon, and T-Mobile all have Samsung video calling S M H 08/23/2016 fux Reply Galaxy Alpha – waiting is the hardest time! 08/23/2016 Charles Reply ??? Lollipop worked ??? Marshmallow worked. The security patch worked… Worked = didn’t brick the phone. Differences in performance = negligible. Additional features almost unnoticeable. Improvements = possibly… then again – maybe not. At least, this stuff does no harm… and, It’s worth every penny ya paid for it…. Will the next security fix – really – fix anything… It won’t matter. The guys out there hacking code are so far ahead of the security patches – that they aren’t loosing sleep over the security patches. The security patches only patch found leaks anyway. Will Nougat fix the security issues… = probably not… but, it will make life difficult enough on the device owners to make them think that security has improved.. The hackers are way ahead of the process. They’ll have Nougat leaking while it’s still in beta. So.. we will get yet another candy flavor – this year… That will fulfill our un-expressed desires… They’ll add stuff that we didn’t ask for, telling us that we can’t live without it. They’ll sell it as a security necessity, whilst working on all the dozens of known security compromises. And, roll out a bug fix / security patch weeks after they drop the barely out of beta Nougat. All this does not matter to me. I’m in this for the damn phone. So long as I can make calls / receive calls – I’am ok with all the update/patch bull$hit… Just don’t brick the phone. 08/25/2016 sadsds Reply who can tell me when malaysia will get marshmallow update for galaxy a8(-a800f)? 08/26/2016 Ray Reply I just got the Marshmallow update for my AT&T S5 today.

I also just received the update for the Galaxy Tab S 8.4 tablet. I’m glad they supported this tablet but they clearly did as minimal work as possible. There’s almost no visible change whatsoever. No change in notifications or app drawer at all. Some very slight changes in the Settings menu and that’s about it. I am eager to try bonding the SD card with the main storage memory though as the 16 GB tablets have never cut it. 09/12/2016 MarshmallowForcedFacortyReset Reply I was woken up this morning around 1:30 to my phone making the tmobile sound. I get up and it said the update failed, I selected to have it try again and it forced a factory reset on my phone. All my contacts and out of my 200+ contacts I have 11 now. None of my bookmarks for internet browsers are there. I can’t seriously be the only one. I have a Samsung J7, model number SM-7J00T, and I’m in Washington State. Even things some of the things I had saved on my SD card got wiped. So you can imagine I’m beyond many colorful expressions, especially with the line of work I’m in and the fact I’m also in school right now.

Are you planning to update to Marshmallow? 04/18/2017 Jackson Reply Great article, Thanks so much. 05/13/2017 Debra Reply I accepted this update 2 days ago and it ruined my phone. After the update my phone screen started to turn purple ink like then it added pink now black! Samsung blamed it on Verizon and Verizon said they have nothing to do with the update. Obviously Samsung does. Samsung told me I have to send it in to them for repair but they can not tell me how much it will be! This is BS! I cannot afford a new phone and Samsung should replace my phone or fix it as this is their fault. Leave a Reply Cancel Reply Your email address will not be published. Comment Name* Email* Website
gizmodo Deadspin Fusion Gizmodo Jalopnik Jezebel Kotaku Lifehacker The Root Video Sploid Paleofuture io9 Science Reviews Field Guide Microsoft's Apps Problem Has Never Been More Dire Alex CranzYesterday 12:57pm Filed to: Microsoft Build 2017 Build Microsoft Windows 10 Windows Store Windows 10 S 105 4 Edit Promote Share to Kinja Toggle Conversation tools Go to permalink Images: Alex Cranz/Gizmodo At Microsoft’s Build conference, the dorkiest of companies put on a big show, complete with fog machines and fancy lights, in order to show it’s a cool competitor to Apple and Google. The speakers who came on stage during keynotes had stylish hair. “Do they have dressers backstage?” an attendee asked a group of us when it was all over. Advertisement Build exists to get developers excited. The biggest devs blow upwards of $2000 for a three-day pass to the event, where they have unlimited drinks, plentiful meals, and access to Microsoft’s best and brightest. Part of Microsoft’s wooing process involves appearing “hip” to a group of developers who resemble the cast of Silicon Valley in all the worst ways. Hence the light show and Microsoft EVP Terry Myerson’s questionable hoodie and leather vest combo. It wants these devs so amped that they’ll rush back to their MacBook Airs and Surface Books to crank out brilliant software, hopefully for Microsoft’s Windows Store, which has just one third of the apps of much cooler stores from Google and Apple. With the arrival of Windows 10 S, which can only use apps from the Windows Store, the app marketplace has never been more important than today. Yet time after time over the course of the event, Microsoft dropped the ball on its pitch to developers in favor of niche distractions. Apple’s a monolith of money and users, and thanks to Android and Chrome OS, Google is right there with it. Both have OS platforms with heavily used app stores. They’ve built customer bases of hungry fans that enthusiastically embrace their hardware and software products, and consequently, developers want to build apps that work with Apple and Google platforms. Microsoft, on the other hand, can’t seem to ditch the buttoned-up association it’s developed for making the work computer you don’t want to use. Its reputation is seemingly forever cemented by those old Mac vs PC commercials. Attempts to rewrite the script have been met with mixed success. On the hardware side, Microsoft has become a genuine player in the field of coveted kit. The Surface Pro and Studio are ambitious devices that are legitimately exciting. The Surface Laptop announced earlier this month is one of the most interesting products announced so far this year. But Microsoft’s software landscape is still dorktown and one of the big ways Microsoft’s attempting to undorkify things is by leaning into the Windows Store. There’s a problem though. Microsoft’s app store in uncommonly small compared to the other guys. According to Microsoft, in 2015 there were just 669,000 apps available. (The company hasn’t officially updated that number since.) According to Statista Apple and Google both have more than three times that number of apps available in their stores. Advertisement Advertisement The number of available apps alone doesn’t necessarily dictate the quality of someone’s computing experience, but it remains a common metric for success, and if Microsoft wants to look cooler in the software space, it needs a big awesome app store full of big awesome apps. Microsoft stunned the audience of Build when it announced iTunes was coming to the store just a week after announcing Spotify’s arrival. Those are two hugely important apps, and you could feel the energy in the keynote after the announcement. Developers and press looked at one another, baffled and delighted. An Apple app would appear in the Windows Store! Then Microsoft immediately squandered that excitement. The rest of the focus both on stage and later in the “Hub,” the primary showroom for the conference, wasn’t on the cool apps traditional users might want, but on the deeply nerdy niche stuff. Sponsored During the keynote itself, Microsoft glossed over the lifestyle apps to focus on Autodesk and Linux. Autodesk was up on stage to announce that Autodesk Stingray was headed to the store. Stingray is an engine used to build things in 3D and is almost exclusively used by 3D artists and engineers. After that announcement, Microsoft followed up with the news that Linux was coming to the store. If you’re excited about the Linux distributions Ubuntu, Suse, and Fedora arriving to the Windows Store, know you’re uncommon. It’s big news for developers, but meaningless to people who would normally seek out apps on an app store in the first place. Site of the Build keynote. There are lots of blue lights and...fog? Given Microsoft’s enthusiasm for the store, it was weird that the company’s newly announced operating system, Windows 10 S, which can only get apps through the store, was mostly absent from the conference, apart from a few mentions during the keynote. You couldn’t find it anywhere on the show floor, where developers mingle with Microsoft personnel. Nerd city. The Store booth had a lone TV screen with a rep standing in front of it—and that rep had not been briefed on Windows 10 S. In fact, it seemed no one had. Every Microsoft rep I asked seemed bewildered by Windows 10 S questions. They could say it was “exciting” but they had no spiel ready for why it was exciting, nor why the Store was crucial to its success. Advertisement And no one could explain what, fundamentally, might have changed about the Windows Store to make it an appealing avenue for app launches after a five years of sluggish adoption. Even app developers that were bullish about the platform were frustratingly vague about what was different now compared to when the Store launched in 2012, and why Windows 10 S would not go the way of its failed store-focused predecessors Windows RT and Windows 8.1 with Bing. Christoph Teschner and Michael Simmons were positively giddy about Windows 10 S when I sat down with them in a high-rise hotel near the conference. Both men are employees of Algoriddim, and were in Seattle because their app, DJay Pro, had just received the App Creator of the Year award. “I think that’s the future,” Simmons said of the Windows App store. Advertisement Teschner pointed to his own youth, growing up with Apple’s app stores for Mac and iOS and how it had prepared him for the Windows Store. “People are used to app stores now,” he said. “It felt sort of natural to me when I first got my Windows Store.” Though they were reluctant to give exact numbers or concrete evidence of a successful Windows Store launch, Simmons said “Windows fulfilled our expectations.” He praised the development process in particular. “Seeing developer tools ten years ago, it’s a total leap today. It’s an evolution and we’re in the middle of it.” Neither man could give a concrete reason for why they felt Windows 10 S had a chance to succeed when its predecessors failed so badly, but sitting in a room and soaking up their optimism it was hard not to be swayed a little. Advertisement Advertisement And it’s that kind of optimism for app developers that Microsoft will need if it hopes to actually fill the Store with cool apps. If those men had been on the show floor, showing off their app and talking up their own experiences with developing for the store, Build might have actually projected the image Microsoft desperately needs. But Microsoft is still figuring it out. It has ditched the pocket protector, but it’s still not cool. Recommended Stories What Is Microsoft's Grand Plan for Phones?

We gave you an exclusive preview of that feature about a week ago. Now, Allo 11 is officially introducing those selfie-generated stickers for everyone, but this update also packs evidence of several other features coming in future updates. About APK Teardowns: In this ‘APK teardown,’ we’ve decompiled the latest version of an application that was uploaded to the Play Store. When an app (or an APK, to be specific, in the case of Android apps) is decompiled, we’re able to see various lines of code within that hint at possible future features. Keep in mind that Google may or may not ever ship these features, and our interpretation of what they are may be imperfect. With that in mind, read on. Google Duo Integration This new version of Allo also prepares for Duo calls from conversations. Using these new buttons, you’ll be able to easily tap and make a Duo call from within Allo (although we’d guess that you’re just going to get moved over to the Duo app for the call). <string name=”action_duo_audio_call”>Duo audio call</string> <string name=”action_duo_video_call”>Duo video call</string> As you can see below, the app will recommend that you download Duo if you haven’t already. <string name=”duo_invite_dialog_both_missing_duo_body”>Get the app to enjoy free video &amp; audio calls with anyone on Duo</string> <string name=”duo_invite_dialog_both_missing_duo_title”>Make free calls</string> <string name=”duo_invite_dialog_contact_missing_duo_body”>Invite %s to Duo so both of you can make free video &amp; audio calls</string> <string name=”duo_invite_dialog_get_duo_button”>Get Duo</string> <string name=”duo_invite_dialog_one_person_missing_duo_title”>Call %s for free</string> <string name=”duo_invite_dialog_self_missing_duo_body”>“%s is already on Duo! Get the app and you’ll both enjoy free video &amp; audio calls”</string> <string name=”duo_invite_dialog_send_invite_button”>Send Invite</string> Like in Duo, you will also be able to invite your contacts if they don’t have the app installed on their device. Add groups with QR Codes Google is also trying to make Allo easier to use, and for that they’ve launched QR Codes for groups. With these new codes, friends can just scan your code and they’ll join your conversation. Here are the relevant strings, but this feature is already enabled. <string name=”add_with_qr_code”>Add with QR code</string> <string name=”group_link_please_wait_fetching”>Finding your group on Allo…</string> <string name=”group_qr_code_title”>Group QR Code</string> <string name=”message_failed_to_generate_qr_code”>Failed to generate QR code.</string> <string name=”qr_code_scanner_hint_text”>Ready to join? Center the Allo code to scan</string> <string name=”qr_code_scanner_invalid_dialog_title”>“That code isn’t valid”</string> <string name=”qr_scanner_activity_title”>QR scanner</string> <string name=”scan_qr_code_to_join_group”>“To add someone to the group, have them scan this code”</string> Share invite link In Allo 11, you’re now able to share groups links so anyone with that link can join you and your friend. Even better: In case the link goes online for some reason, you can reset it. In that case, the first link won’t work anymore, and you’ll get a new link.   Google Assistant Settings Since Google Assistant came out, all settings were only in the Google App. Google is now preparing Google Assistant settings inside Allo. <string name=”google_assistant_settings”>Assistant Settings</string> <string name=”assistant_all_options_subtitle”>Update what the Assistant knows about you</string> <string name=”assistant_all_options_title”>Assistant options</string> We don’t have much more information about this for now, but as you can see above, you’ll be able to update what the Assistant knows about you. Allo 11 is now rolling out in the Play Store. If still don’t have it, you can always check APKMirror if you can’t wait for some features. Dylan @EvoWizz 9to5Google contributor and French Android fan!

Even men curious about the aging process have one question first and foremost in mind: “Will my penis get smaller?” Internet search data might be the Holy Grail when it comes to understanding the true nature of humanity. Stephens-Davidowitz, a former data scientist at Google, has spent the last four years poring over Internet search data. In addition to anonymous information about Google searches, he has “downloaded all of Wikipedia, pored through Facebook profiles,” and even received the complete (though anonymous) search and video view data from the popular porn site PornHub. What he found is that Internet search data might be the Holy Grail when it comes to understanding the true nature of humanity. “I am now convinced,” he writes, “that Google searches are the most important data set ever collected on the human psyche.” Here are some of his fascinating findings: SEX: Small members, big butts Google searches indicate that penis size is far more important to men than it is to women. “For every search women make about a partner’s phallus,” Stephens-Davidowitz writes, “men make roughly 170 searches about their own.” In addition, women’s concerns about penis size are often the opposite of what men fear, as “more than 40 percent of complaints about a partner’s penis size say that it’s too big.” The second-most common search by men, Stephens-Davidowitz found, is “how to make their sexual encounters longer.” But here too, their concerns conflict with women’s, as “there are roughly the same number of searches asking how to make a boyfriend climax more quickly as climax more slowly.” Of course, Google searches reveal that women too have their own body hang-ups — but their concerns have changed over time. In 2004, “the most common search regarding changing one’s butt was how to make it smaller,” Stephens-Davidowitz writes. But thanks to J.Lo, Kim Kardashian and other large-bottomed beauties taking center stage, this desire did a 180 over a decade. There were more searches asking how to make your butt bigger than smaller in every state. “In 2014, there were more searches asking how to make your butt bigger than smaller in every state,” Stephens-Davidowitz writes. “These days, for every five searches looking into breast implants in the United States, there is one looking into butt implants.” One finding that “will disturb many readers,” according to Stephens-Davidowitz, concerns the sort of porn women want, based on search terms typed into PornHub. “Fully 25 percent of female searches for straight porn emphasize the pain and/or humiliation of the woman,” he writes, citing search terms inappropriate to reiterate here, but featuring words like “painful,” “extreme” and “brutal,” and often focused on nonconsensual sex (depictions of which, he emphasizes, are not permitted on that site). “Search rates for all these terms are at least twice as common among women as among men.” The PornHub data revealed another disconcerting fact about American sexuality — that we seem to be going through a disturbing incest phase. “A shocking number of people visiting mainstream porn sites are looking for portrayals of incest,” Stephens-Davidowitz writes, noting that 16 of the top 100 searches from men seek “incest-themed videos.” The number is fewer for women but still an unnerving nine out of every 100. Love and Marriage: Gay husbands and fat kids According to official surveys, married men and women each report having sex about once a week. Google, however, paints a bleak picture of American sex lives. “On Google, a top complaint about a marriage is not having sex,” Stephens-Davidowitz writes. “There are 16 times more complaints about a spouse not wanting sex than about a married partner not being willing to talk,” he writes. “Searches for ‘sexless marriage’ are three and a half times more common than ‘unhappy marriage’ and eight times more common than ‘loveless marriage.’ Even unmarried couples complain somewhat frequently about not having sex. Google searches for ‘sexless relationship’ are second only to searches for ‘abusive relationship.’” Is my husband gay? is a surprisingly common search. These searches also show that men may be the ones holding back, as “there are twice as many complaints that a boyfriend won’t have sex than that a girlfriend won’t have sex.” Connected or not are the findings that women often question their partner’s sexual orientation; “Is my husband gay?” is a “surprisingly common search.” “‘Gay’ is 10 percent more likely to complete searches that begin with ‘Is my husband . . . ’ than the second-place word, ‘cheating.’ It is eight times more common than ‘an alcoholic’ and 10 times more common than ‘depressed.’” Google searches not only help us see another side of relationships but also help cut through the lies we tell on social media, as they starkly undermine the rosy pictures we paint on Facebook. Stephens-Davidowitz notes that the top five terms women use to describe their husbands on social media are “the best,” “my best friend,” “amazing,” “the greatest” and “so cute.” When they search anonymously, however, typing “my husband is . . .” into a search box, the top five results are “gay,” “a jerk,” “amazing,” “annoying” and “mean.” And if searches reveal the depressing reality of how people feel about their mates, their attitudes toward their children are no better. When people contemplate reproducing, they worry about possible regret if they don’t, as “people are seven times more likely to ask Google whether they will regret not having children than whether they will regret having children.” Once those kids are born, however, the sentiment undergoes a rapid reversal, as “adults with children are 3.6 times more likely to tell Google they regret their decision than are adults without children.” Google also reveals the inherit sexism among parents toward their kids. “Parents are two and a half times more likely to ask ‘Is my son gifted?’ than ‘Is my daughter gifted?’” Stephens-Davidowitz writes, noting that this carries through for all intelligence-related queries, such as, “Is my son a genius?” (Stephens-Davidowitz notes that in reality, young girls are more likely to be in gifted programs than young boys.) Parents’ concerns for their daughters remain appearance-based, Googling “Is my daughter overweight” twice as often as posting the same query for their sons. In reality, he notes, “about 28 percent of girls are overweight, while 35 percent of boys are.” Racism: Shocking searches in surprising places The elections of Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012 and Donald Trump in 2016 generated much discussion about just how racist our country really is. Stephens-Davidowitz writes that Google searches help provide the answer — and it’s not pretty. He notes that the first time he typed the N-word into Google Trends, he expected it to be “a low volume search.” “Boy, was I wrong,” he writes, noting that there were “millions of these searches every year.” “In the United States, [the N-word] was included in roughly the same number of searches as the word ‘migraine(s),’ ‘economist,’ and ‘Lakers.’” Digging deeper (and eliminating the version of the word often used in hip-hop lyrics, which he thought would skew the findings), Stephens-Davidowitz found that “20 percent of searches with the word . . . also include the word ‘jokes.’” The word was also commonly paired with the phrases “stupid . . .” and “I hate . . .” Obama lost roughly 4 percentage points nationwide just from explicit racism. Examining search results from the night of Obama’s 2008 election, he found that “roughly one in every hundred Google searches that included the word ‘Obama’ also included ‘kkk” or ‘n—-r(s)’ . . . In some states, there were more searches for ‘n—-r president’ than ‘first black president.’” If the sheer volume of the racism was surprising, so was its location. “Surveys and conventional wisdom,” would have us believe racism was coming more from the South than the North and more from Republicans than Democrats. Online searches, he writes, show otherwise. “The places with the highest racist search rates included upstate New York, western Pennsylvania, eastern Ohio, industrial Michigan and rural Illinois, along with West Virginia, southern Louisiana and Mississippi,” he writes. “The true divide, the data suggested, was not South versus North; it was East versus West. You don’t get this sort of thing much west of the Mississippi.” As for party affiliation, “racist searches were no higher in places with a high percentage of Republicans than in places with a high percentage of Democrats.” This data was borne out by voting patterns. Crunching the numbers, the author estimates “Obama lost roughly 4 percentage points nationwide just from explicit racism.” Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy Filed under data ,  google ,  surveillance Share this article: Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy Read Next Computer whiz curbed global cyberattack with $11 purchase Read Next Computer whiz curbed global cyberattack with $11 purchase Share Selection Trending Now on NYPost.com 41,424 Comey's firing is a gift to the FBI 34,916 Rich girl charged with shooting father after he evicted her 20,445 Dead man found on subway is fourth public corpse in four days Now On Edie Falco arrives in style to ‘Wizard of Lies’ premiere Waitress who serenaded Mariah Carey is a New Yorker Nicolas Cage was meant to star in ‘Paris Can Wait’ SEE ALL Video Here are 7 surprising things you didn’t know about Howard Stern Now On The Best Erotic Thrillers on Netflix SEE ALL More Stories page six Carolina Herrera blasts Venezuela 'dictatorship' after nephew's death Now On Decider Nicole Kidman Spits Out Chef Giada De Laurentiis’ Food During Contentious Cooking Segment nypost Comey's firing is a gift to the FBI New York Post Facebook Twitter Instagram LinkedIn Email Email Newsletters Mobile Apps Contact Us Tips Facebook Twitter Instagram LinkedIn Email Sections & Features News Real Estate Page Six Tech Sports Media Metro Photos Entertainment Video Business Alexa Opinion Covers Fashion Horoscopes Living Classifieds Newsletters & Feeds Email Newsletters RSS Feeds NYPost Store Home Delivery Subscribe Manage Subscription Preferences Help/Support Customer Service App FAQ & Help Contact Us Tips Newsroom Letters to the Editor Reprints Careers Apps iPhone App iPad App Android Phone Android Tablet Advertise Media Kit Contact Post Digital Network © 2017 NYP Holdings, Inc.

The phone and operating system were announced in October, when Google and Samsung, which makes the phone, said it would be available in most parts of the world in November. It is already available in some countries, including Canada. Verizon has not said why it has taken longer than expected for the phone to become available. On Wednesday, it announced via Twitter that the Galaxy Nexus would go on sale the following day. Google recently pushed out a fix for a fluctuating volume issue on the phones and some people speculated that may have led to the delayed launch at Verizon. It's possible that the delay is due to a decision by Verizon to ask Google not to include Google Wallet, a new payment application, on the phones. Verizon said it made the move so it can work out technical issues. But some people have wondered if the reason is that Google Wallet could compete with Verizon's own mobile wallet initiatives. Others have suggested Verizon might be violating net neutrality rules by not allowing users to access the app. Verizon has said it continues to talk to Google about the issue. The Galaxy Nexus runs the version of Android known as Ice Cream Sandwich. It's the latest in the Nexus line of Android phones, meaning it comes stocked with all of Google's mobile applications. The operating system was designed to unite the tablet and phone versions of Android into a single release. Ice Cream Sandwich includes updates across the board, including zero shutter lag on the camera, facial recognition built into the unlock mechanism, and a new data usage management application.

Google is having issues with account sign-in, resulting in errors with Android devices, OnHub, and Wifi Phil Oakley Follow View All Posts 2017/02/24 5:48am PDTFeb 24, 2017 18 Plus 1 on G+ 184 Share on Facebook 91 Share on Twitter Total Shares293 Google News My Google account is the key to much of what I do online, so not being able to use it is a bummer. Since yesterday, many people have been having issues signing in to their accounts - we at Android Police have been seeing this across the US and Europe. However, Google has confirmed on the Product Forums that this is not the result of a hack or malicious activity. Google is aware of the issue, and has put a note up on the Google Play support page, saying "If you’ve recently been signed out of your account, sign back in using your usual username and password at https://accounts.google.com. If you can’t remember your password or can’t sign in for another reason, go here to recover your account password. For security reasons, our support agents are unable to assist with password issues." According to Down Detector, the company is still having issues, although possibly not as widespread as before. However, the problems are not the result of a hack or phishing, so if you have been signed out, you shouldn't need to change your password, as your account is still secure. Google account issue, having been signed out of the account. Google has confirmed that this is what has been causing Google Wifi and OnHub products to reset themselves. This unfortunately means the devices need to be set up again. Google lists how you can tell if the device has been reset, and how to re-set it up, on the support page. If you've recently been signed out of your Google account, sign back in here. Let us know in the comments what you've been seeing, and we'll try and keep you updated with any new developments.

Google account OAuth tokens stored by third-party apps that use Cloudflare could have been exposed. It's weird, too, since it also deauthed every app I was signed into, including Google Apps Script. It seems that something on your end went through every request you had in that data sample (and Google's cache), invalidated tokens if it found any, then prompted the user to sign in again. Like David, I'm just speculating, as I couldn't find anything related to this in my G Suite console as well." Ben Lee well said using your Google account may be, but this is direct login to Google itself, which would not be affected in itself. I only had the Google accounts logged out on the device, no specific apps were affected. My apps account and main Google account, 2 others went affected. Ivunsasu This happened to me last night. I didnt know what was going on. I thought I got hacked or something (even though my password didn't change). Checked all my credentials and everything was in-tact. Changed my PW anyways. Glad to know this is the cause. This happened for about 2 hours last night, then I restarted my phone, and things have been quiet since then. Bill D Same here - I guess a small side benefit is a lot of users updating their account passwords! Ivunsasu yep <3 drksilenc Same i use a yubikey for security though so a breach is unlikely. Swaminathan Guru Ran into this issue today on my Pixel, while at the same time I was signed in fine on my OP3 Andrew Ran into this on my s7 edge and chrome on desktop Suicide_Note I've not had any problems, but my wife noticed it on her Gmail. alexus I have same issue on nexus 6p & watch Tomáš Petrík Me and whole family had the issue last night. Ben Lee Had this last night on 2 of my accounts on tablet and mobile, very frustrating. I got scared and changed my passwords, thought someone was messing with my account. Glad I've discovered it was a Google issue. rjyanj Holy fuck. I thought my account had been compromised and my identity stolen! Glad I finally saw this 12 hours later. Adrian I had this happen last night. Signed back in and haven't had any problems since. It only happened on my phone though. They texted the code for me to enter, I did, and everything worked as usual. Milo Joseph Jesus google dont scare me like that.. I thought my life was over.. Scary how important a google account is HSidhu I know shadowx360 Good time to remind everyone that it's imperative to run two factor authentication on your main Google account. Google doesn't support security questions anymore so if someone takes your account, it's almost impossible to take your life back. Impulse_Vigil Set up a backup email/phone # and store those emergency codes too. Daniyyel Django Touboul wow I feel you, I was 90% sure that my account was hacked. Justin I got hit with the google home bug that prevents it from responding to anything, saying there's a problem or a glitch, and when I rebooted it, I had to unlink and relink my account. Thinking that having to sign in again is related to this as it hit my pixel yesterday afternoon and my chrome browser at home this morning. Weird. YaKillaCJ Ran into it last night on my Umi Super. Said changes has been made to my terms or something. So I need to login, but it wouldn't. So I backup after entering my password twice and I was never logged out. I was like hmm, I'll just monitor my account activity for a bit because I would rather not have to change my password. But this article is a relief. Stephane Sby Balmy Same, woke up with "sign in please" on my phone, i freaked out and i was about to factory reset my phone + change my password... Gonna do it anyway i think Wayne Randall Changing your password and then factory resetting your device _will_ lock it down, IIRC. Be particular in which order you choose. I'm certain I will be corrected if I'm wrong. Stephane Sby Balmy Thanks for the warning, the order i plan to use is PW change, then factory reset. 07070 I don't have this, last changed my account password 3 days ago though. bolski I've been seeing this apparently from my phone. I don't have any Google WiFi products, unless my Chromecast is one of them. Oatz Just knew I was hacked. Stop it Google! Playing with my emotions! Cinj Had the issue last night while using OGYoutube. I merely thought Google was finally blocking that app. thingswentworsethanexpected.jpg.exe Cai I was wondering why my phone asked me for my password again. 😂 OmniWrench I would just like to add my voice to the "Oh that's what that was!" chorus. Thanks for the heads up, much appreciated... Plus this gives me a link to send to tech-support relatives as well. Gohan040 Happend to me yesterday evening in the Netherlands. First I noticed I google assistant didn't work properly on my pixel c, tho it worked on my Nexus 4 which I o ly use as a assistant in my bedroom. (No google home in the Netherlands sad enough) A few minutes later I noticed a notification from Google on my s6 edge. If I could sign in again, so I did with two step verification. Everything looks fine again at the moment. 8giggles The odd thing to me is that I'm logged into my account in my browser, both on my phone & office desktop. My phone/Google apps need me to sign back in & it's telling me there's been a CHANGE to my account. What change?! I didn't do any change. Did THEY do something? And if so, a heads-up would have been appreciated. But if there was a change to my account, why am I still logged into my Google acct online? The Zombie Hustler Exactly. I'm curious now as to what happened that caused this Travis Coble Completely forgot about that, same here. Upon review no event signifying a change could be found in account history. 😕 Impulse_Vigil Same, I went to my security settings and checked it hadn't been logged in elsewhere or on other devices, it wasn't so didn't think much of it after that. Glitches happen, they should probably revise their stock messages and/or how these glitches are labeled at time of re-login tho. llf It's okay for us who know a bit about the Internet and we can search for the answer that "Google just logged you out, log in back and no panic." But, Google needs to know that some non-geeky people depend on their service too. I set up location service for my senior family members. And they were logged out. Then I lost their whereabout. Try to feel how I felt. 😕 Just hope Google has learnt from this issue and avoid it in the future. 8giggles 😮😲 That would have really upset me too! Steven Santinelli weird, only device that had issues was the nexus 5x. all the tablets were fine, S7 was fine, and wifi and home were fine... :) Jordan L I had the "change to your account" bug yesterday too, around 4:45pm EST. I basically had to sign into everythign thing again. My friend said he Google Authenticator 2step was not working either, codes were not accepted. (I'm guessing he had to remove and re-add it.) Feels like it's working now. really curious what happened. feels like an emergency hack response or something of that nature. HSidhu BiG Data leak at Google, Accounts hacked. Jordan L they would have forced password change, no? OR it's somekind of account token leak. just actually read the article above... Google would have said, "we are investigating a small, isolated security incident". right?! HSidhu no company will say that to keep their reputation, question to you why we know about the BIG data leaks after 2 years? example - Target, Yahoo (Yahoo was silent for 2 years). The Zombie Hustler I'm from India. Same thing happened to me last night. Changed my passwords on all the accounts and applied 2 step verification, thinking my account had somehow been compromised. Glad I'm not the only one lol Sean Thomas had to log in to all three google accounts I have on my phone last night. was weird. The Zombie Hustler So. What EXACTLY happened that caused this? Fred this actualy is Google's reaction to cloudbleed : https://blog.cloudflare.com/incident-report-on-memory-leak-caused-by-cloudflare-parser-bug/ Matt S. Was wondering if that cloubleed issue had to do with this. I had been asked to re-sign into my accounts all over the place for Google products and somehow didn't put two and two together. Gabriele Tomberli It has been confirmed by Google to not be related actually: https://bugs.chromium.org/p/project-zero/issues/detail?id=1139#c25 Matt S. Huh wow, pretty curt response on closing the thread there. Wonder what the actual issue is? Arkitech Not really. He was right in stating it was completely wrong to ask there. More often than not folks who have that sort of knowledge level will be curt about most things. I work with a lot of them so maybe i'm just used to it?? ¯_(ツ)_/¯ Matt S. Ha yeah, not the place and it was to the point, just sometimes feels a bit impersonal. TomCarchrae all the related security fallout could be considered to the point though, and that would be a lot! sadly, i doubt we'll ever see a transparent anything ever come out of google in terms of reacting to a breach. Pranjal Bhatia Happened to me a couple of days ago. I wasn't able to login and every time it showed "Server error try again" , on contacting google , they told me to change date & time manually and login again and it worked. They told me it was a sync error. This happened on another device of mine , i simply just logged back in and the issue hasn't returned. AdamH I have no issues. But few days ago Youtube was down for like 2 or 3 hours in the Czech rep. It might have something to do with this. Brian Flores Happened to me as well. My accounts also said "Brand Account" underneath them. It was the weirdest thing. Good to know I shouldn't be alarmed. Leo Ya, happened to me in Canada too. debsuvra I was just logged out of my secondary Google account on a third party mail app on Android. Primary email account works fine, both on phone and PC. Howard Stern ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ keep being asked to log in to my chrome browser at work and a tablet at home....i'm not getting this at home. nor on my phone. Dustin Gerlach I was unable to use my Google account on my phone for about 3 hours yesterday. exquisitemb I came home from work yesterday and worked for hours trying to figure out what was wrong with my Google WiFi spots.. Glad to see there was an actual cause for it.. Badouken This freaked me out so much last night. I went ahead and enabled a ton of security settings and was still receiving it. I was like what's going on?!?!? DirkBelig Happened on my Nexus 6P last night and thought it was some malware hack despite no w4r3z being loaded or even being rooted. Suspected phishing, but it seemed legit and reentered PW. Later it popped up on my Nexus 7 and my buddy's Pixel XL. Later, when word was finally getting around that there was some sort of glitch with El Goog, when I was logged out of my Nvidia SHIELD I wasn't worried. Robin I am from India and yesterday I face this issue, but only I face this issue in my family strange. PJ I do know my password and have entered it in all my devices only to have the pop up say my Google Account Has Been Changed and I need to enter my password which I had just done. It does not recognize my password. WTF? Hamilton Jimenez Vasquez That happened to me last night as well and was like "What?!!" Anyhow, after the shocking experience I though perhaps is time for me to change my password once and for all for all my web accounts, it's the same since two years ago. I know I've been doing this wrong in the wrong way because you are suppose to change it every 6 months, but Man, it is kind of bummer since I have to go through about 40 different webs sites, it is a process that takes a lot of time and effort in my case :( Ahnaf Mahmud Android Police you should probably check your site connection with cloudflare. Kim Having issues with it in Airmail on my iOS Travis Coble Had this happen yesterday on my 6P, and was seriously nervous I had been hacked. The best part? My two factor authentication made everything worse, as everytime a verification code was sent via text (NOT my preferred method FYI), Google Sign-In would spaz out and reset, so the process was repeated three to five times. A quick reset seemed to fix the issue, and I have been using my account with no apparent issues. imsoupercereal Glad I saw this. I did a lot of digging last night to make sure my account wasn't compromised. Ming William Lee I had it last night, really scared, especially AP did not post anything on it at the time... -Matoro Zeliph- I THOUGHT I WAS HACKED yesterday! This isn't funny Google! Maybe they did this on purpose so that we can change our passwords to be stronger. No longer I will use my pets name as a Google password Cakefish Looks like I am in the tiny minority who wasn't affected at all. Weird. Rob Same here Maria Hernandez I had this happen to me and thought someone tried to hack my account. I have that 2 step verification turned on so I wasn't too worried. Demonshout Thought I was hacked lastnight, changed my password and everything. saf1927 Had this issue yesterday, but I simply had to enter the password and the 2FA code to get back to business. Hurricane Andrew This happened to be yesterday as well. I was concerned, and went to my security settings to check for any new device sign-ins or security events, and there were none, so I felt a little better but have still been uneasy. This article clears up my remaining concerns and puts me at ease. Thanks for the coverage, Phil! SB This happened when I tried to watch a movie on our LG Smart TV. When tried to rent a movie I had to enter in the code that was shown on the tv as verification. SpasilliumNexus Welp I'm temporarily locked out of my phone. I've got hit with this on my 3T and changed my password. At the same time I was backing stuff up to do a factory reset. After I did the reset, when I try to sign in on the phone it says I have to wait 24 hours. Jen Unfortunately, this is different from and unrelated to the weird issue that's been plaguing many Google Home users for over a week and is therefore causing our problem to get less attention (because support thinks we're talking about this account linking/sign in thing). For some reason, after a random (small) number of home automation commands, the GH just stops responding with anything other than "something went wrong, try again in a few seconds" until the device is rebooted from the 3 dot menu in the app. Then all is fine again until a few more home automation commands are issued. While there is now a pinned thread about this in the product forums (https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!topic/googlehome/tOFxNFN_exg), it doesn't look like any significant progress has been made on even officially acknowledging the issue and its status. thespacecowboy It weirdly only happened on one of my google accounts, and not both of them. I trusted it as it was a proper google notification rather than an email. I HOPE those can't be spoofed... Juniors234 Just got signed out for no reason from my Google Account 5 mins ago. -__- HSidhu Change your password, big data leak at Google. Hamdi Ferchichi On Windows 10 too! Ailín Ó’S I had this happen in Ireland on my Nexus 9 and OnePlus 3. Scared me to no end! Pedro Diego Fernández I was freaking out about this yesterday and found nothing online, only 2 or 3 post from 3 years ago, without any clear explanation... now I have 2steps verification and my tinfoil hat on just in case HSidhu Big G is not safe anymore, moving my photos from Google Photos. Vivek Rameses It hasn't been for years. Probably around the time they dropped the do no evil motto. wjrandon In addition to my Android devices. My Google account has been disconnected from Chrome on various computers and applications that depend on Google Sign-in have lost their account authorization. gosa Had this one last night (CET) Googled the issue, but I either didn't search properly or I was too early. Went through two "better safe than sorry" password resets because of the lack of information found. But at least I learned about two factor verification in the process... Robert Nicewander Keep an eye on things, I had to sign in on my phone yesterday and today I've gotten two phishing E-mails. May be unrelated, but I rarely get these kind of E-mails and I don't believe in coincidence... SIGTRAP Got that notification on my phone last night. I bet the intern over at Google tripped over an ethernet cable. Martial Clausse Happened to me too... Removed my account, deleted cache & data from Google play services. Readded my account. Everything works now. Andrew Brereton For me it's only the new Google Voice app. Every time it opens I have to sign in, and when it's backgrounded I don't get any notifications. Very frustrating. Everything else works though. Socaltyger Still can't log into my YouTube account on my Nvidia shield. Keeps getting the same error message. Lee Anne L Happened to me yesterday and I'm in Ontario Canada =( Ignacio Nallar My Google Now (I believe now it's Feed, can't keep up) won't load since yesterday. Might be related? TedPhillips i had assumed this was because of the sha1 break, they want people to sign in again to rehash tokens... that said, my account got dinged several time a couple of weeks ago, heard about this though last night from the 'rents (thought they had been hacked) Paul Yep happened to me on my tablet, phone and desktop chrome browser but once I signed back in on all of them, it worked without any issues. Was strange because I was in the Google Play Store at the time and it just happened out of the blue, anyway, glad it's not a security issue. ekngee yup, happened to me as well. woke up with a notification telling me to sign in because "something was changed". and my 2FA got reverted to SMS, not Google Prompt. when i went in to check my security settings, Google Prompt could not find my phone. >:( had to remove and add back my account to get things working again. keithzg I had this yesterday, but by today my phone is back and listed without me having to do anything. (Note: I live in Edmonton, Alberta.) ashjas This is due to yesterday's cloudbleed data leek bug of cloudfare in my guess,that google is being silent of. Vivek Rameses Same here on my device. My apps in play store says authorization required. But I could care less. Not doing any harm. dsignrr I had an issue with my Motorola tablet the week before last, when after some updates all my google apps ceased to function. Gmail and Maps would open and immediately close again, while Drive and Photos would open to show only some of my files and pics. Google sign in was posting error messages saying there was no wifi even though the tablet showed strong signal and other apps, including Play Store were functional. I tried everything, even did a factory reset on the device, and after 2 days of wasting time, I bought a new tablet and erased everything again on the Motorola. All my other devices, phones, other tablet, and laptop, had no issues with accessing my Google account. I can only assume that some update affected that particular unit. It is running Android 4.1 and I "did" disable Play Services and uninstall the updates followed by fresh updating to no avail. Michael During this period my Hangouts send a few blank messages to someone on my friends list. I do have 2 factor auth enabled. mazamorac Speculation: Google forced everyone's sessions to log out to protect them against Cloudbleed session token caching. I for one am grateful that I've had to reauthenticate. I also changed my application-specific passwords, make sure you do so if you're using 2FA. Darnell Good to see Google has made an announcement. Google still beats the heck out of a Yahoo account :-D . Hex I still cant get any help from Google. They are not sending the code to my phone still. How to fix this? When I use my email, they send the code, but then it links to 3 different accounts Ive never seen before. Also when I ask for them to find my account, put in my phone number and name it says there is no account. Can anyone help? Is there a way to contact google by phone? Wallace Finch My phone can log into Google just fine with the browser but the Gmail refuses to sync. I can't authenticate the account, it keeps saying the password is wrong (it isn't). I've disconnected the account from my phone and then re-connected, but it still won't log in. Courtney&Cyrus Staley Still locked out two weeks later because the two step codes aren't being sent right either. They say they're aware of the issue and working on it. Doesn't help. Alisa MotoAdventureGal This sign out issue happens to me several times a day. The result is that I do not get incoming text messages because I have been inadvertently signed out of my Google account. The frustrating thing is that I only get signed out of Google Voice, not email or Google Drive. What's worse, is that I was just in Cuba. I inadvertently got signed out of my account due to their system errors, and then when I tried to sign back in I was told that this service is not supported in this country. So I had zero access to my Google account. Very frustrating! halfbloodnative I need help info got a new phone and it's saying that their has been a recent password change try back in 24 hours is this the case after 24 hours will it let me log in the Google account I have two other devices and they are working fine was told that it's a security feature and nothing I can do for 24 hours please is this true I'm going nuts trying to fix this and I'm not touching my phone untill 24 hours is up and I was told if I try any sooner then that it will reset the clock is this true charley peixe New sign in came a couple of days ago, what fucking shit it is, how many times l need click to get it to turn to my email address, then how many times l need to click to get it to accept, google is finished and l am going to yahoo instead, years of google crap is enough. __bobnewman please stop your bitching. thx.

Google's "Project Treble" will modularize Android to make updates faster Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/05/12 12:42pm PDTMay 12, 2017 95 Plus 1 on G+ 162 Share on Facebook 76 Share on Twitter Total Shares333 Android O Android OS Development Google News Easily the most annoying aspect of using an Android phone (with the exception of Pixel/Nexus) is slow updates. Android 7.1 (which came out last year) currently sits at 0.5% marketshare, and brand new phones are still being released with 6.0 Marshmallow. Google is aiming to solve this with "Project Treble," which will modularize part of the Android OS to decrease the time OEMs spend updating their devices. If you're not familiar with how Android updates work, here's a summary. Google releases a new Android version, which silicon manufacturers (e.g. Qualcomm, Mediatek) have to supply drivers for. Once that's done, device makers (e.g. Samsung, HTC) can start re-adding all the tweaks they have made to the new Android source code. In the case of carrier-sold phones/tablets, device makers then have to wait for the carriers to approve the update. After all that is done, users finally start to receive the update. Google is hoping to speed up this process with Project Treble, which changes the architecture of Android. Essentially, a new 'Vendor interface' will contain all of the low-level software for a device - like the chipset drivers. Google will work with chipset manufacturers to make sure the Vendor interface is forwards-compatible, and the interface will be validated by a Vendor Test Suite (VTS). The aspect of this news I'm most excited about is that the Vendor interface is forwards-compatible. There have been many cases where chipset manufacturers have not updated drivers for specific popular chips, preventing devices using them from being officially updated to newer Android versions. One example is the Nexus 5 and other Snapdragon 800/801-based devices, which were never officially updated to 7.0 Nougat. It sounds like the Vendor interface will prevent this from happening, or at least prolong the end of support for a given chip. Google says that Android O will be the first version to use the new Vendor interface, and the Android O Developer Preview already has it. Hopefully we'll hear more about Project Treble at Google I/O next week. Source: Android Developers Tags Android android o project treble treble vendor interface vendor test suite vts subscribe ...

PI there are quirks ,,, its not easy for highly customizable rom ,, OEM will stil rant about it and the only thing we will do rant about them ,,,and that's what we r doing for all those years,,OEM don't give a dam shadowx360 Sounds like a stopgap till they can get Fuschia running with their own kernel. Hopefully this means Google can update more core system functions similar to Google Play Services independent of the OEM/carrier path. Mike Updates still have to go through carriers, this just helps prevent devices from early EoL and should make OEMs jobs easier by not having to rewrite every piece of code to work with new drivers. TechGuy22 that's why this is useless. carriers are still involve and OEM like samsung takes time with their own skin destinyhud thats why i buy pixel. also, like mentioned this will reduce the amount of modification needed in android's new version which means slightly early release. even if its 2 weeks early i am good wit it TechGuy22 or or you can push google to make things easier for carriers and OEMs and not bandages i have an S7 edge and a pixel xl. go figure Taco Monster You can't make things easy for someone who doesn't want to do said things. bekifft It's why I buy Pixel too but the whole point of Android was supposed to be freedom and choice. If my only real choices are Google or Apple, I might as well buy a damn iPhone. PI This Daniel Not necessarily. All the OEM has to do is bring their crap (skin) from the last android version. Of course that probably only happen with small android updates (8.1?) Zsolt V Why shouldn't they? By all accounts, they add value so it's worth the wait. CA-Sandra Fuchsia is a very long term project. It's not going to replace Android anytime soon. Dextro I've been saying for ages that Android needs an hardware abstraction in the vein of what Windows has in its driver model. Hopefully this is it and helps get those updates out faster. Sadly I expect that the endless stream of UI customization OEM make will end up killing any kind of benefit this brings. Corbin Davenport I want something like that too, but I'm not deeply familiar with the technical structure of Linux/Android, so I would assume sure there some massive limitation that is keeping that from happening. Dextro I think (but am now 100% sure on this so don't quote me) that Linux historically hasn't had any such abstraction. Drivers are meant to be inside the kernel and compiled for each specific version. That works fine if the code is open source and committed to the kernel repos but it becomes a nightmare for binary blobs. The kernel makes no allowances for stable driver APIs, they will break stuff and won't worry for anything outside of the kernel if I remember correctly. That's probably part of the reason why Android has failed to keep up with Linux kernel versions. keithzg The kernel makes no allowances for stable driver APIs, they will break stuff and won't worry for anything outside of the kernel if I remember correctly. I wouldn't really say this is true. In fact, there is a very stable API provided by the Linux kernel. Hell, one of the most famous Linus rants was about this very topic: It's a bug alright - in the kernel. How long have you been a maintainer? And you *still* haven't learnt the first rule of kernel maintenance? If a change results in user programs breaking, it's a bug in the kernel. We never EVER blame the user programs. How hard can this be to understand? WE DO NOT BREAK USERSPACE! https://lkml.org/lkml/2012/12/23/75 Obviously drivers are trickier, but they're still expected to continue working. The big catch comes in that ARM drivers tend to come as compiled binary blobs. There really isn't an allowance for that in the workflow of things for Linux; good citizens are supposed to provide source, and then new kernel versions and the drivers therefore (often within the kernel itself) are recompiled, and everyone's happy. But while the API remains the same, the ABI does not; drivers compiled as modules for an older kernel won't work on newer ones, even though the drivers would almost certainly work fine if they were recompiled. The ARM space is utterly lousy with proprietary drivers (in no small part this is Qualcomm's fault, although they're far from the only offender). Hence you have Google forever backporting kernel updates to older kernels, so that the ABI remains consistent and older device drivers continue working. Dextro Well, I stand corrected then. But one question then: I was under the impression that drivers were not in userspace but in kernelspace. That's why I didn't even think much of that famous Linus rant. keithzg True, they're (generally; FUSE, for instance, is an area of exception) in kernel space, and that rant isn't entirely applicable because of that, but for practical purposes that just means ABI changes break drivers. And the kernel devs do reserve the right to change the in-kernel API at any point, which could in theory break drivers---it's just that in practice they are rather worried about such breakage and don't wish to do so, and barely break it more than they do userspace. When you think about it, it'd kindof be an insane amount of maintenance if people had to update driver code for new kernel versions! Luckily for "desktop Linux", most drivers these days in the x86 space are open source (NVIDIA is remaining holdout, although even there you can fall back to the Nouveau drivers most of the time), so they're just baked into the kernel or provided as kernel modules, and in practice don't really have to be touched by human hands after they're originally written. Unluckily for Android, that is very much not true in the ARM hardware world. Hell, most Chinese OEMs will just flatly refuse to provide kernel source, even though they're legally obligated to do so. Gaurav Kumar Which is why fuchsia has a stable ABI...like windows. I agree it's not coming anytime soon but it may not be that far away as well.. Lawstorant in the linux world, the answer is DKMS. There's no need for kernel catch-up anymore. I bet Google is doing something similar. Сергей Бугаев Android has the HAL https://source.android.com/devices/#Hardware-Abstraction-Layer -- but it haven't been helping much, as we can see (or would it be much worse without it?). It'd be interesting to see more technical details about Tremble to understand how it's different. Andy J https://developer.android.com/things/index.html pretty much this is what they are aiming for - from the days of Project Brillo. "System updates and support: We provide the system image, updates, fixes, and more, so you can focus on creating compelling products" Brillo/Things is the same idea - there is the low level vendor stuff, the actual OS and then the OEM stuff. Google can update the OS on running devices in the field, without worrying about the vendor stuff or the OEM stuff. Knowledgeborn Allah Exactly... And, unfortunately, this probably isn't going to be anything like Microsoft's new update process for Windows 10 Mobile, which doesn't have to go through carriers. Based on all the software modifications most Android OEMs make with their devices, this probably won't speed up OS updates at all. More powerful devices may last slightly longer, but that will still leave it to the OEMs to support those devices for longer periods, and they likely won't do that anyway, since they're constantly trying to get you to purchase the next one... Zsolt V Windows 10 what? Knowledgeborn Allah Dismissing Windows 10 Mobile (and rightly so) doesn't change the fact that Android needs to learn a few things from them. Their update process, at least right now, is still miles ahead of anything Android is doing. Google should've followed the path that Microsoft already laid when it comes to updating software systems outside of the carriers. It looks like they took one thing that's beneficial but disregarded all the other necessary parts... ¯_(ツ)_/¯ Zsolt V As in how to drop 50% of the devices with the Creators update? No, thanks, Google has nothing to learn from that process. Knowledgeborn Allah Again, you're still missing the point... This isn't about dropping support for any devices with the Creators' update. This is specifically about them bypassing carriers to directly deliver updates to their consumers, which they can sustain for longer periods of time. Google has a lot to learn from that process. Zsolt V Doesn't matter. The end result is the same, the user doesn't get an update. You are missing the point, maybe you don't have one? Knowledgeborn Allah Maybe I don't have one? You sound like an idiot, bud... Maybe you have difficulty reading. I specifically stated in my original post, which you replied to, what the point was: "And, unfortunately, this probably isn't going to be anything like Microsoft's new update process for Windows 10 Mobile, which doesn't have to go through carriers." Again, the point was based on the fact that Windows 10 Mobile updates - regardless of how many people actually have Windows 10 Mobile devices, or how many devices will be discontinued due to the Creators' update - don't have to go through carriers. That's the point. Android as a platform can learn a lot from that. Before making ridiculous replies about a subject and, in effect, making yourself look dumb, maybe you should read the post you're replying to first. Just a thought. PVL_93_RU Windows 10 mobile is dead Knowledgeborn Allah https://www.onmsft.com/news/latest-windows-10-mobile-updates-bypass-carriers-update-phones-directly Say what your want about Windows 10 Mobile when it comes to development, but it's definitely not a good look when a "dead" platform can update their devices better than Android can. 🤦🏾‍♂️ Robabobbob So which windows phone OEM is actually making a modification anything close to what android OEMs do? Knowledgeborn Allah That's not the point... The point is that you can separate core Android OS functions from the themes and launchers inherent in other variations of Android provided by other OEMs. Right now, Android's update process is a disaster. Even after the OEMs push out updates to their devices, it still has to go through various carriers to actually get to consumers, showing that the carriers are actually the ones in charge. Windows 10 doesn't have that problem. iOS doesn't have that problem. Android has that problem. bekifft I agree completely about the HAL, but the real problem remains the network operators retaining strict control over user devices. If AT&T doesn't want to spend the money to add AT&T Navigator, AT&T Device Locator, AT&T Messages, etc etc etc, they will simply not deploy the update. SomeGuy112 This is great, gives the potential for much longer OS update support, especially for Googles own hardware. Hopefully the OG Pixel gets longer than 2 year OS support because of this. destinyhud good point Dn Bro Didn't the article say the new devices with O will have this? DragoCubed The dev preview for the pixel has this project. We can assume it's staying with the pixel MrHanMan So, is it Trebble, or Treble? Jdban Treble according to the google docs Corbin Davenport It is Treble, I can't spell. Fixed. Jeff The trouble with Trebbles... destinyhud i really hope this fixes the 2 week delay in getting major update to nexus devices /s John Doe This is good but Google need to do more. They need to modularize everything in the Android update process. Create a separate carrier update so the baseband can be updated separate from the OS and same to drivers and also OEM skins/Apps. This should have FIVE different updates paths: 1) Core OS/Kernel update path 2) Driver update path 3) Baseband/Carrier related Apps update path 4) OEM Skin/Apps path 5) Security update path This way Google can control the Security, Core OS, Baseband, and Drivers by working with carriers and silicon manufacturers. Also if T-Mobile for example wants to push an update out for the baseband and messaging/phone apps they can do that independent of Google and OEMs. The same goes for Samsung and Qualcomm and others. Latheryin You are confused on one part. What you call skins are not what you think they are. All of the OEM versions of android are completely different distros that replace core OS files and frameworks with their versions. John Doe I know but If Google were to modularize it then it would just be a "skin" or "theme" that is separate from the framework/OS this will give Google control over the main OS and the only way to do that is to not allow OEMs to modify it too much. Latheryin Which would remove all the extra features that devices add on. Many have to be tied into the frameworks and other base OS drivers and libs. There is no separation in it really. And with the way they licensed Android they cant really control a whole lot. Any OEM could easily reverse anything Google does and still release it. John Doe Well yeah of course Google can't do that alone they would have to make new agreements with OEMs and carriers. Most OS skins do not have that many extra features and Google can create APIs to allow OEMs to modify anything they want like if Samsung wants to add an Iris scanner as a password or whatever. The point is OEM "skins" need to become more like launchers in the play store like Nova and Apex and If OEMs want to modify something they would have to ask Google like how Microsoft treats windows. Latheryin You really dont have a great understanding of how things work. That will never hap=p=en. Maybe with Googles second mobile OS they might try to have more control. John Doe How about instead of being an arrogant prick, you tell me what I said is incorrect or what Google cannot do? Why do you think this cannot happen? Microsoft did this with Windows mobile. Like I said, Google would have to sign new licensing agreements with OEMs and Carriers but they probably have to revise it for this Project Treble anyways. Google already uses its Apps and Play store as a bargaining chip to update those agreements. Latheryin Ok first. Google would have to change the license under which android is licensed. Which can't be done. Also have you ever ripped Android apart and had a look? I would guess not as if you had we would not be talking about this. As for what we does does. That really is apples and oranges. Not even close e same thing. The apps and play store are not really that big of a deal. There are hundreds of android devices released every year that don't include them and they sell really well. John Doe You said NOTHING I have not said already. Why Google cannot change the Android license? What stops Google from implementing this since you are the Genius that ripped Android apart and decided this cannot be done? Google already has MADAs in place and they update them every few years with OEMs. Those devices are mostly in China since Google services are banned there. If the Play store is not a big deal then Samsung would have forked Android a long time ago. But go ahead I am still waiting for your "intelligent" replies. Even Amazon's fire phone failed miserably without the play store and Google apps. Latheryin Have you even read the license? Do you really have any idea what happens when something is licensed? Doesn't take that much really. Anyone can look at the code. Heck some of the best android developers are teens. Samsung already did. It's called tizen. Also Samsung is not the end all of devices. They even have a separate store for the devices they run with Android. All Samsung apps don't even hit the Play store. They are Android devices for the common man. Made for everyday people. Ask your favorite developer what device he runs. Look if you want to know more why not dig in, instead of trying to get into a tech conversation when you don't really know too much about it. John Doe Licenses can be updated and their MADAs can be updated which they already do. Samsung did not fork Android, they created a different OS. And that is not turning out very well for them. You still have not told me how what I said cannot be implemented. You should go get one of those Teen Android developers to help you out before you just turn down ideas that you have know nothing about. If Google wanted to they can change Android to how Windows does updates there is nothing stopping them from doing that and OEMs will not fork Android if they did that. I love how you just criticize arguments without providing valid reasons instead of just saying Android does not allow you to do that provide factual reasons or STFU. klaus666 Could this also help to port LineageOS to a smartphone once LineageOS is adapted to this new modular system? jgarrido I dunno, sounds like treble to me... JD OK I get that Google is essentially making what in the Windows World is the HAL and breaking that out of the Kernel and they're essentially creating a lower level API (For lack of a better term) to segment off Android from the OEM mods. However what is actually stopping the OEMs from sayin' fuck this ain't working out let me go in there and refork it anyway. I mean API's are there, now and OEMs should be using that to interact with Android but Android is coming up short so they fork it and custom build the ROM with their own customization and branches. For the longest time the camera stack was a HUGE reason for doing this, even now the Camera2 API is still coming up short, which is why Samsung Completely branches on their own for that too. freshprince_87 Google simply needs to make it mandatory for carriers /OEMS to update their devices and release new phones in the most current version of Android Adnoxaei They could make it a requirement for access to the Play store. Without this interface, that would have been very restrictive. With this interface, customizations can still easily exist, so companies may be more willing to cooperate...espevially if it cuts down on the time needed to test and deploy updates boop By the sound of it, the Vendor Interface is for SoC manufacturers, not device makers. jcopernicus Sweet! Can't wait for my Z3 Compact to get this update! NubCake This doesn't sound like a treble idea at all, hopefully it helps the slow updating process. Knowledgeborn Allah I see what you did there... 🙄😂 ddevito No bass.... Tom Westrick But what if a user is all about that bass? Killa Then they might be in treble if that's all they are about. Sorry, couldn't help myself. :P Emergency Medical Hologram Bassed on what? Martheen Cahya Paulo There's plenty of tweeter surrounding it. Dolby so if we consider the stereo type. Testraindrop While this is certainly a step in the right direction, I somehow doubt that this will change Googles attitude to abandon their own devices after 2 years. Its not like the SOC in the Nexus 5 stopped working when N was installed, in fact its working fine, developed by independent individuals without having "to work with chipset manufacturers", which Google apparently couldn't even achieve. Also the times where google stops updates for the N6 and the Pixels is already set, so even with a chipset blob that is "forwards-compatible" there wont be any further (official) updates. Also if those Vendor APIs will have limits to certain OS aspects like camera, sound etc., then manufacturers will not use them and will just fork again the OS as done currently. saf1927 The custom ROMs that work on Nexus 5 devices don't actually benefit from a lot of things that an officially supported device would. Qualcomm has completely abandoned the chip so from a retail perspective, it's not suitable anymore. Even the "security updates" that these ROMs show in "About phone" aren't actually all implemented, since none of the proprietary blobs and binaries could be updated. Just because a device can be updated with a custom ROM, doesn't mean it's actually running it well. someone755 "Just because it's running it well doesn't mean it's running it well." Welp. saf1927 Wait, what? I can't find that sentence anywhere and I don't remember editing the comment. AbdulB1 Mediatek and in some cases​ Qualcomm (for Nexus 5,sd800,801) don't want people to stay on old phones they try to force them to buy new phones for latest Android version. I am not sure will they be happy about this change? I suspect they will flood market with phones running Android nougat instead. They will try to resist this change by Google. saf1927 Mediatek and Qualcomm aren't device makers, they are silicon manufacturers. AbdulB1 Mediatek charges device makers for new drivers for latest Android versions. Qualcomm stopped supporting sd 800/801 for Android Nougat and thus even sony a device maker who was developing Android N developer versions for a SD800/801 stopped. Chipset makers also have huge clout , it not just sensor makers who decide to support or not their older hardware for newer Android release. saf1927 Well, my point is that none of the silicon manufacturers will force anyone to make only Nougat phones, like you claimed. AbdulB1 "Google will work with chipset manufacturers to make sure the Vendor interface is forwards-compatible, and the interface will be validated by a Vendor Test Suite (VTS)." so if Vendor dont get validated for VTS then do you expect any chances of Android O for those devices? dizel123 I suspect if OEMs want to release new phones with the latest OS version because that's what their users want(I know I'm making assumptions) and Mediatek and Qualcomm try to force them to release phones with Nougat, then Intel will suddenly become a dominant player in the mobile market. This would be exactly the kind of "in" they're praying for. AbdulB1 Intel architecture is quite old , I owned 2 Intel based Android tablets. Intel even didn't bothered to upgrade the OS from 4.0.4 and other one had 5.0 as latest release even it though it was buggy as hell and every hardware vendor went for 5.1 instead. Intel had an edge of running windows along android on their cpu tech. But lack of proper built in modem destroyed their chances in Android world. Their SOCs still had quite high consumption even after releasing newer and newer generations of Mobile SOCs. dizel123 I don't have any inside information, but I'm guessing Intel is working on fixing their problems and making high quality SOCs Cakefish Intel dropped out of the mobile SOC wars. It cancelled development of all upcoming chips last year, I believe. dizel123 Their announcement at this year's Mobile World Congress as well as their current road map on their website both indicate that they're still developing mobile SOCs Cakefish So has it changed since this? -> http://www.anandtech.com/show/10288/intel-broxton-sofia-smartphone-socs-cancelled dizel123 Read my last comment again Lateef Alabi-Oki Jesus! What took them so long? pfmiller I believe there are performance costs to adding hardware abstraction. Google may feel that mobile hardware is finally at a point where it's worth the cost. Justin Martin This was my question. What is it going to do to performance. Not that I'm a Samsung user, but how much will touch wiz suck now? AbdulB1 Will it help in churning out custom ROMs? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I actually want the vendors to work on Android itself, not just their layer. They fix a lot of the bugs that Google leaves in. saf1927 They are already working on that: "In addition to the architectural changes, we're working with our silicon and device partners to take their code changes, such as features for a carrier network in a specific country, and move them into the common Android Open Source Project (AOSP) codebase. For example, Sony and Qualcomm contributed dozens of features and hundreds of bugfixes to Android O so they no longer need to rework these patches with each new release of Android." Simply put, some vendors contribute more than others. Sony is a great example in that regard. They contribute a lot. dizel123 This might just be the best thing Google has ever done to Android Eddie Ringle If you want to see more technical details, here's a bit of what I found back in March when the Developer Preview was released: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13928385 SHunter Orrrrr.... https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/7b191be55920725d6f6aba09c97c1e1942bdfb290cb4cf53e2cb9e23c706626c.png Eumelanin Knight Better late than never. Let's hope Carriers and Manufactures don't have their way and muck this up some how. bekifft At least they're being up front about the problem finally and making it an official "project." It seems like every year the promise is "we're fixing battery this time" and "we're fixing updates." Every year. Never gets better. And with the current FCC and the network operators only set to get worse about their abusive practices, I don't hold out much hope for this plan. What it boils down to is if there is any possible way for network operators (carriers) to meddle with the update, they will. This practice truly aught to be illegal, but see above. Maybe this will at least help lazy to the point of negligence OEMs (Lenovo) not be so appallingly slow. Islam sounds like a joke to me. John C.S. Lock When you finally giving up on Android after 10 long years , here we come iOS ! charfarstar I'll believe when Pixel 2 comes with 4 years of OS updates. MeCampbell30 Turn the treble up in my headphones. Régis Knechtel OMG! I can't believe they're finally doing something about it! https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/5acada086a36a588b7289e5b2a26d7c5f205e0b15a6c77c9b631f1a387dc8d2a.gif Cypher Hey guys and gals, let's add more abstraction to make this slug of an OS even slower! But hey, at least you'll get more frequent updates so that it can get slower more often! xyz People have been telling Google to use their muscle with the chipset makers forever. Qualcomm didn't release drivers is not an acceptable reason to not update Android. Sir_Brizz Hardware manufacturer doesn't release drivers is a perfectly acceptable reason not to update. Consumers should level their hatred at the right target. Blaming Samsung, for example, for Qualcomm's shortcoming won't change Qualcomm's policies. Andy J So last year it was A/B updates from Project Brillo and this year it's the ability to update the OS independently from the low level chipset drivers and the OEM stuff - which is also something Google developed for Project Brillo. While there are no actual Project Brillo / Android Things products in the market yet - it was definitely a worthwhile project for them with these rewards. (Yes I'm aware Chromebooks had A/B updates - but from everything I have heard, they still came about because of Project Brillo, even if Project Brillo wasn't an actual thing when they found their way to Chromebooks) kelpa32 it take google untill android O to try to get updates on time. Urmil Shroff Am I dreaming? Is this really going to happen? PI -This things don't work as u r expecting it ., Google can make guidelines but cant force OEMs to follow it . Oem will still not pass this ,, they will rant about high testing methods and quality benchmarks , ultimately they will pass it for devices only which they want (flagships) only ,, PVL_93_RU This is huge for Android in general. Of course the ideal way of doing things is following ChromeOS model where Google is entirely in charge of managing and updating the software, but then we'd lose out on what makes android unique, which is OEM skins Still though, modular updates are hopefully the next step that will really accelerate how fast devices receive OS updates. Especially mid-range and budget models Patel Nisha I swear I see something like this for every release but yet never happens Paul It's all fine and dandy but I suspect most phone companies still wont upgrade them because they want us to upgrade to newer phones so keeping older phones on older firmwares is in their interest so I don't think much will change. In any event, I'm happy that Google is doing this because it's one less excuse phone companies have to not upgrade their phones, but personally, I think Android could do with something like what Windows does with upgrades so almost any hardware can upgrade to the latest Androids without the manufaturas getting in the way. TonGi018 This is really exciting news! Android Developer Will this also lead to more updates, over a longer period of time ? boop Potentially, as it eliminates the forced EoL when the SoC manufacturer drops support, but it's still up to OEM and Carriers to develop and distribute updated. Android Developer Maybe for Google Pixel , at least? Maybe more than 2 years of updates?

[Update: Starts today] Google Assistant is coming to all Android 6.0 and above devices Rita El Khoury Follow View All Posts 2017/03/02 8:10am PDTMar 2, 2017 244 Plus 1 on G+ 833 Share on Facebook 222 Share on Twitter Total Shares1299 Google Marshmallow 6.0 News Nougat 7.0/7.1 Videos Update 1: 2017/03/02 8:14am PST And right on time, it looks like the Assistant rollout to non-Pixel Android M and N devices is starting today. Google already published a short YouTube video ad and a I guess it was bound to happen: Google Assistant is finally breaking free from the shackles of the Pixels and launching onto the millions of devices running Android 6.0 Marshmallow and above, no need for GApps or root. But this shouldn't come as a surprise to you. The signs were there all along. Despite being revealed as a Pixel exclusive on phones in the Android 7.1 changelog, Assistant has been available through Allo on all Android 4.1+ phones, announced for all Android TV 6.0+ devices, and was shortly enabled by mistake through an alpha version of the Google app on non-Pixel phones. Actually, it was that same alpha app that gave us plenty of hints that Assistant would be coming to more Android devices. Plus, we've known for a while that the new LG G6 should have the Assistant, which hinted, if not confirmed, that the Pixel exclusivity was not long for this world. And now the news is official in conjunction with the launch of the LG G6. Google says the Assistant will start rolling this week to Marshmallow and Nougat devices for English users in the US followed by Australia, Canada, and the UK, plus German speakers in Germany. More languages will be added later. It will replace Google Search, launching with a long press of the home button or the "OK Google" voice command. We don't know yet if it'll require an update to Play Services or if it'll be a server-side switch, but we'll sure update you either way. As for what you can do with Assistant, think of it as an evolution of Google Search and "OK Google," with a bit of added functionality like smart home controls, remembering things, and an open API developers can plug into. However, don't be surprised if you notice that Assistant on your phone is still oddly missing some features that Google Search has had for a while, like recognizing songs, reading messages, and adding items to specific Google Keep lists. The hope is that when Assistant launches on non-Pixels this week, it will truly replace Google Search and not lack any commands users have been issuing for years, or disappointment will ensue. The even bigger hope is that the fragmentation of what you can do with Assistant on phones, Home, Wear, and Allo (not to mention TV and Auto when they are available) will no longer exist. Well, one can dream. Update 1: 2017/03/02 8:14am PST And right on time, it looks like the Assistant rollout to non-Pixel Android M and N devices is starting today. Google already published a short YouTube video ad and a tweet to let everyone know this is happening now. Now rolling out to more @Android phones, it’s time to meet your #GoogleAssistant → https://t.co/tu9bGCgo7F pic.twitter.com/aeWdgBTJH1 — Google (@Google) March 2, 2017 Let us know if you've started seeing Assistant on your devices and check whether that involved a new Play Services version or was simply a server-side switch. Remember, the rollout is limited to English users in the US first, so you may not see it if you live overseas or if you have chosen another default language in your Google settings.

Updated Google play services to highest I could but it wasn't working. Then I JUST cleaned the cache out for Google play services and Bam! I now have Google assistant. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/6cb8c320d8f17d7df606268679b2367b91c0612375dda58cda3a03056300cbfa.png Paden Rivers Updated Google play services, cleared the app cache and Bam!

I'm not looking for an experimental interactive experience Scarlett how do u revert back? Joe Beach Go to languages, choose English, then choose US Virgin islands. After that swap the Virgin islands to the top as primary. Then no more garbage assistant Scarlett it doesnt show that for me :/ Scarlett i just uninstalled all the updates on the google app, fixed it for me, not putting up with shitty assistant Joe Beach Doesn't work on pixel. Not sure what to do if that doesn't work SavageJeep Why? I hear people saying No On Tap or missing this but I have seen little functionality lost. Joe Beach Obviously everything is personal preference. To me a smartphone is a tool. I'm not going to start talking to ratchets and hammers or phones. I definitely don't want any of them to talk back to me. IMO all they need to do is put a switch in settings where you can choose Google Now over assistant​. This is an attempt to best apple in something but I think Siri is stupid, along with assistant. I'm not alone on this. It slows anything I want to do down also. SavageJeep Have you tried it. You don't have to talk to it if you don't want to. Go into Google via the app or the search bar and everything is the same, cards, weather, news... Manbir Maan 8 Am in India. I check my 6p and BAM! Got that GA😀 Satyapriya Satyarthi Finally got it on my moto G4 play (India). ACF05 Got it! Samsung galaxy s6 edge, Italy, english US. If you do not receive yet try to cancel the cache of play services. Simon Hooker Hi I am just letting you know I have the oneplus 3 running open beta 12 in the UK , and I have just received GOOGLE ASSISTANT OTA....thanks and regards... Geoff Cormier Got it on my AT&T LG G5 Norm Ostasiewski Got it today, 3/8. Nexus 6p in eastern US. Yay. Freddy De La Cruz same here. Noticed it last night, 3/7 David Marín One question, if I live in Spain but I have the mobile in English, will I have Google Assistant at the same time as in America or will I have to wait? Bala kumar As I understand from other users, the location doesn't matter as far the Device and Google app language is set to English US. But Google only knows WHEN you will actually get the Google Assistant. David Marín Thanks! Few minutes after read your comment I tried to launch Google Assistant and it's here! https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/748fea8f3e1369f434811749515ae82e104539d69504577854e7566a5c6c4ce1.png Bala kumar But still I didn't received it 😪😥 nasso Me neither Nexus 5X spain David Marín I replied you in you're other comment ;) David Marín Do you want the apks? Bala kumar Yup... If can ACF05 i live in italy and setting english US i reiceved the assistant, update the play servicies and clear the cache, next try... good luck David Marín Ok! Thanks! 2 minutes after read your comment I tried to launch Google Assistant and... IT'S HERE!!!! https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/748fea8f3e1369f434811749515ae82e104539d69504577854e7566a5c6c4ce1.png ACF05 Good! 😀 David Marín Yay! 😁😀 nasso What version do you have? Spain Nexus 5x and Play services v 10.2.98 what can i do? And set to english us David Marín Those ones (view the photos). If you want, I can share you the apks... I have an Aquaris U Plus an I have it so... Are you from Spain?! I was thinking that I was the only one😂😂 https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/0f9b6519116662c92ee5ecd82cfe2cbfb5a43f19afa46415772ed7873bc23e06.png https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/01b0a71a1100677fe25462a202f86a6a3a4f8d73281396afe871f9779315fac0.png nasso Do you have telegram? We can speak by there David Marín Yes I have, but I prefer to continue talking here to not make public personal data nasso No problem haha just received an Android update on my Nexus 5X later i'll tell you news nasso Nothing after the update i'll wait for this night David Marín Do you want that I share you my apks or Google Play Services and the Google App? nasso Yes please but are going to work on 64 bits processor? And i have the same Google APK David Marín Hmmm... I am running 32 bits software (the hardware support 64 but the software runs 32 bits), so I don't think so yet... nasso I only can wait i think but what happen first, the Play services update or assistant appears? David Marín Try to do this: https://youtu.be/gt9MTBWrTlg. After start, download TouchVPN to fake that you live in India. Good luck! wlkn Just arrived on my HTC 10 this morning. I just realized how much I use Google now :( Urmil Shroff #APKPLZ AbheySaini Got it in India! HD Where's Android Wear 2.0? Doby Gillis Who cares? Has nothing to do with this anyway. Daniel Krause AW 2.0 uses Assistant ;) Carlos David Got it on Ecuador! Yesterday updated to March security patch, maybe related. Cleared cache before rooted the phone, maybe clearing cache related too. Jeesan I got the assistant after uninstalling the updates from play services (after deactivation) and updating to current level. I am in India and using Nexus 5 https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2bde0c886bdfbbde24709c418416c172f4921894531ae62ec1a4e0379b45e804.png Richard Mircea Thanks for the tip. Just got it myself this way. Jeesan Uninstall play services to factory level and update to current level again to get the assistant. In India, Nexus 5 EcE Did not work for me. Bala kumar What is your play services version? Bala kumar I believe it is being activated by Play Services version 10.2.99 & above. But manual installation via APK won't work. We need to get the update via play store. Above are just assumptions . Daniel Tiberius Automatically got it on my T-Mobile v20. Neato! BlackHawkRider . Finally got the google assistant on my phone. There was no notice regarding it. I just happened to press the home button to scan a text message and assistant popped out! Anyone else got the assistant yet? Austin Eschweiler My T-Mobile 6P got it last night, wasn't any update that I saw so it must have been server side. Matt I got Google Assistant in the UK after installing Play Services Beta and setting all language settings to US English. Restarting my phone a couple times and then leaving it alone for a little while. But I changed the language back to UK English and after about 30mins, it reverted back while I was using it! So if you get it and want to keep it don't revert back to your language (or UK at least) just yet. nasso How do you install Play services beta? I've joined to the beta a day ago and no updates yet Bala kumar You didn't got an update in Play Store since GOOGLE didn't flipped the switch yet for you... As I said in other comment, only GOOGLE knows WHEN you will get it... ACF05 Try to update the play services from apkmirror and to delete the cache of it. nasso What is the version i have to dowload? I've cleared the cache and rebooted at least 3 times ACF05 The last version, look in the menu of application of your device what version you have so you can see what apk you must install nasso Thanks a loot!! I've Google assistant!!!! Amaziiing ACF05 Great! 😀 ghostdroid1 Finally got it on my S7 edge yesterday! Scarlett is there a way to take off the google assistant to where if you long press the home button it sends you to google now? douglas gomes Hello. I can not activate Google assistant. I would like to know who has the Google app Beta and which version is it? Beatle Bailey So let me see if I've got this right according to reports... People got Nexus devices ostensibly to be first in getting all things new in Android. Of those people, many also enroll in beta programs to be at the forefront of innovation. It looks like those people are mostly still in the dark waiting for Assistant (including me) while Joe Shmoes everywhere are getting it on Motorola, Samsung, etc. devices. 🖕 Google. Blake Yep. How the Nexuses weren't first is kinda mind boggling. Still nothing on my 6P. Anel I got it yesterday, but after 1 hour it disappeared, now i can't activate again, it just doesn't show up? Any idea why Beatle Bailey Is your phone rooted by chance? Anel No, stock andorid 7.1.1 nexus 5x Anel No its not im stock Bala kumar Did you change the Phone language or Search Language? Anel I didnt touch nothing, its weird isn't it? Anel No i didn't change anything,, strange geeq i just hate google for the fragmentation of android, now GA, still no waze for android auto... i wish there would be a decent win10 phone with "auto" features, waze, all the google apps like maps, streetview, gmail, etc... ×XWreckTeamX× I know at least 10 people that have it and I checked one of their phones to see if it was a different version on the google app but it was the same as mine Beatle Bailey I'm curious, are you're rooted? I'm starting to wonder if being rooted disqualifies devices for Google Assistant. Like how Android Pay doesn't work on rooted phones. ×XWreckTeamX× No I'm not at&t 7.0 S7 edge Henboy10 I wonder if my Nexus 7 running Android M will get it Ernie Still nothing on my Nexus 6p!!!! Blake Same...It's getting ridiculous. Rob Haven't got it yet :( Marty Some other sites have related Google Assitant to a Google Play Services update, but I don't believe it is. I have GA on my N5X with GPS version 10.2.98. I extracted that GPS as an APK and installed it on another device but GA isn't working on the other device. Ernie Update: Just got it after I got the new Google app beta!!! Marty So far it's working on one of my phones that I moved the Google app to System before installing the Google beta app. I guess it's hit and miss, though, because I did this to another phone and GA isn't working on it. Bala kumar Finalllllyyyyyyyy I got the GA. Just minutes back got an update for Google App beta. May be coincidence...? I didn't clear any app cache, didn't restart the phone... Nothing... Just pop up when I did a screen search.☺️💐 I can say "Google just flipped the switch ON for my device" TannoV I'm an English user in the Netherlands, and it's available to me. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/bcd9c327d79f009bcd9e1807db260db7a8366e766e2a7439b526f6ec28e46826.png David Marín For all the people who don't have Google Assistant yet, try to do this: https://youtu.be/gt9MTBWrTlg. After start, download TouchVPN to fake that you live in India. Good luck to all you! Ktoś It's a bit annoying that you can't select a desired local only for google assistant... (I'm Polish, I have all my devices in Spanish for learning purposes and have google search set to use English(primary), Spanish and English) and… I got the assistant when I switched UI to English US (which has another awful feature of using am/pm ;) ) but after playing for a while I've reverted back... because google now seems more usefull… sergey a Yeah. Got it as well here in Russia. But sure what to do with it though. It is weird to speak with the phone IMHO. 😂 https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/c2964c7d5f2b70be724555503e8d93d1e0fad5c54c973a3d3b308dc0ce1df9b6.png cinval It just turned up on my 5X here in Norway :) cinval Just got it on my Honor 8 in Norway 🇳🇴 but it hasn't arrived yet on my 6P.. Mohammed G. Mansi Finally got it! Nexus 6 7.1.1, signed up for the google app and google play services beta, updated them, cleared data for both apps, restarted the phone, tried, nothing, google app setting, voice, set up google assistant, tried again, vualla :D Gabriele Di Bernardo How did you get 7.1.1 on the Nexus 6? I have been waiting and waiting but currently I have 7.0 Mohammed G. Mansi I flashed the ota manually.. I always do that instead of waiting months for the update to arrive on my phone, it's easy and doesn't reset my phone, so why not? :) Mohammed G. Mansi Guys I just tried it on my wife's phone,I just cleared google app data (all data not just the cache) tried and it worked! She has a Samsung Note 5 6.0.1 Paul Schmidt Just noticed that Google Now had automatically upgraded to Assistant on my LG G3 on Verizon. I am on Play Services 10.2.98 Blake Lol I STILL don't have it on my 6P. Kinda don't care at this point though. But it's weird. Yakuzah Love to know where this feature is, because I still don;t have it enable on my Nexus 6p Gabriele Di Bernardo Press and hold home button ('O' Button) and Google Assistant will open. Was issued with their latest update. I have it on my Nexus 6 with android version 7.0 which I understand will be upgraded to 7.1.1 Harshal Soni I join the beat update of Google app and Google Play services but still I am not able to get the assistant on the launch it just go to the normal search Bar of the Google. I am using the Vivo v5 and this process was made on it. Plz give me reply Manos Striligkas Guys I have a Huawei P8 Lite with android 5.1 that I recently updated to 6.

Next: US wireless carriers now legally have to unlock our phones by Mark Stockley 0Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Google+ Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Anyone who used the World Wide Web in the nineties will know that web search has come a long way. Sure, it was easy to get more search results than you knew what to do with in 1999 but it was really hard to get good ones. What Google did better than Alta Vista, HotBot, Yahoo and the others at the dawn of the millennium was to figure out which search results were the most relevant and respected. And so it’s been ever since – search engines have become fast, simple interfaces that compete based on relevance and earn money from advertising. Meanwhile, the methods for finding things to put in the search results have remained largely the same – you either tell the search engines your site exists or they find it by following a link on somebody else’s website. That business model has worked extremely well but there’s one thing that it does not excel at – depth. If you don’t declare your site’s existence and nobody links to it, it doesn’t exist – in search engine land at least. Google’s stated aim may be to organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful but it hasn’t succeeded yet. That’s not just because it’s difficult, it’s also because Google is a business and there isn’t a strong commercial imperative for it to index everything. Estimates of how much of the web has been indexed vary wildly (I’ve seen figures of 0.04% and 76% so we can perhaps narrow it down to somewhere between almost none and almost all) but one thing is sure, there’s enough stuff that hasn’t been indexed that it’s got it’s own name – the Deep Web. It’s not out of the question to suggest that the part of the web that hasn’t been indexed is actually bigger than the part that has. A subset of it – the part hosted on Tor Hidden Services and referred to as the Dark Web – is very interesting to those in law enforcement. There are all manner of people, sites and services that operate over the web that would rather not appear in your Google search results. If you’re a terrorist, paedophile, gun-runner, drug dealer, sex trafficker or serious criminal of that ilk then the shadows of the Deep Web, and particularly the Dark Web, offer a safer haven then the part occupied by, say, Naked Security or Wikipedia. Enter Memex, brainchild of the boffins at DARPA, the US government agency that built the internet (then ARPANET). DARPA describes Memex as a set of search tools that are better suited to government (presumably law enforcement and intelligence) use than commercial search engines. Whereas Google and Bing are designed to be good-enough systems that work for everyone, Memex will end up powering domain-specific searches that are the very best solution for specific narrow interests (such as certain types of crime.) Today's web searches use a centralized, one-size-fits-all approach that searches the internet with the same set of tools for all queries. While that model has been wildly successful commercially, it does not work well for many government use cases. The goal is for users to ... quickly and thoroughly organize subsets of information based on individual interests ... and to improve the ability of military, government and commercial enterprises to find and organize mission-critical publically [sic] available information on the internet. Although Memex will eventually have a very broad range of applications, the project’s initial focus is on tackling human trafficking and slavery. According to DARPA, human trafficking has a significant Dark Web presence in the form of forums, advertisements, job postings and hidden services (anonymous sites available via Tor). Memex has been available to a few law enforcement agencies for about a year and has already been used with some success. In September 2014, sex trafficker Benjamin Gaston was sentenced to a minimum of 50 years in prison having been found guilty of “Sex Trafficking, as well as Kidnapping, Criminal Sexual Act, Rape, Assault, and Sex Abuse – all in the First Degree”. Scientific American reports that Memex was in the thick of it: A key weapon in the prosecutor's arsenal, according to the NYDA's Office: an experimental set of internet search tools the US Department of Defense is developing to help catch and lock up human traffickers. The journal also reports that Memex is used by the New York County District Attorney’s Office in every case pursued by its Human Trafficking Response Unit, and it has played a role in generating at least 20 active sex trafficking investigations. If Memex carries on like this then we’ll have to think of a new name for the Dark Web.

It’s designed to find things that are dark because the current generation of search engines can’t or won’t find them, not because they’re encrypted. So, using your example, a dissenter who publishes dissent using a Tor hidden service and takes steps to avoid identifying themselves in the words they write would not be identified as a specific individual and their site’s location wouldn’t be revealed but the fact that their site exists might be. So if you’re trying to get word out, it might be a good thing. The Dark Web is dark for the same reason that lots of the countryside is – it’s just not worth the cost of putting up street lights. Reply Joe says: May 20, 2016 at 1:55 am Interstate 60 comes to mind. :) TBH, most of the so-called dark web is not even technically ‘WWW’ AKA http/https traffic. It’s stuff like IRC and FTP (old school!) and P2P filesharing and even yes, anti-spying (privacy) networks. Of course, TOR and Freenet are forms of P2P but not intended primarily for sharing files. Reply Brad Mathers says: February 18, 2015 at 6:12 pm Somebody needs to check what Memex means in Bahasa, Indonesia, just saying Reply 4caster says: February 21, 2015 at 10:57 pm There is no such word in bahasa Indonesia, which has no letter x.

More freedom, more choices, less control, more privacy.

That’s what they would have had to do in the first place anyway. And it’s the easiest refresh scheme for providers like Yahoo! and Google. Reply Mark Stockley says: February 25, 2015 at 2:18 pm The industry uses name-based virtual hosting extensively so any given IP address could harbour any number of websites, none of which will be accessible with the IP alone (and you need to supply a hostname for a valid HTTP 1.1 request anyway.) So you need to get a list of hostnames from somewhere and you can’t get them by reverse DNS on the IP. The search engines use spidering – they follow links or you give them a sitemap. This works on the regular World Wide Web because people want to have their sites indexed so Google and Bing don’t have to try hard to find them. Reply Anonymous says: July 6, 2015 at 9:57 pm How does one log into Memex in order to use it as a search engine? Do I enter it in IE’s search engine screen? Reply William says: November 28, 2015 at 2:05 am Does Memex index websites in a manner that ignores robots.txt rules. If so, is there any liability if such indexing causes damage to a Web server, accidentally or otherwise? Reply P Tegler says: March 4, 2016 at 5:07 pm there are no ‘laws’ saying spider MUST obey robot files. It’s a courtesy and a way for engines to stop themselves from being black listed. (which you can do easliy in your config files) Reply mike says: February 27, 2016 at 8:00 pm The memex (a portmanteau of “memory” and “index”) is the name of the hypothetical proto-hypertext system that Vannevar Bush described in his 1945 The Atlantic Monthly article “As We May Think”.

And the company takes its plans a step further by acquiring Owlchemy Labs, a VR studio mostly known for Job Simulator and Rick and Morty: Virtual Rick-ality. But, why Google chose Owlchemy Labs Owlchemy co-founder Alex Schwartz said that the studio will continue to work on VR games, but now they have Google’s support. “We have a slate of original games that we have in [the] production and prototyping phase, and we’re going to continue to do that,” “We’re very excited to continue to do that with the support of Google behind us.” Also on a blog post Owlchemy reveals that their goal is “continuing to focus on hand interactions and high quality user experiences, like with Job Simulator.” And Schwartz adds that full-motion hand tracking is “kind of our key factor.” And for the record Owlchemy Labs didn’t always handled virtual reality games. In 2011 they released the infamous game Smuggle Truck. The studio gained reputation when it became one of the first studios to work with the first Oculus Rift development kit in 2013. Of course the release of Job Simulator was one the titles for PlayStation VR, HTC Vive, and Oculus Touch motion controllers. Its success was pretty big and the title managed to gather $3 million in sales at the beginning of 2017. Now, Google hasn’t announced any immediate plans about virtual reality but many reports suggest that at Google’s I/O developer conference next week, the company might shares a few news. Now, if you don’t know much about the famous game Job Simulator, keep reading for some info. In this game players participate in simulated jobs in a job museum run by robots resembling floating CRT. The jobs are represented as tongue-in-cheek approximations of real occupations: “Auto Mechanic”, “Gourmet Chef”, “Store Clerk” and “Office Worker”. Accompanied by a computer character who provides exposition and instructions, players perform tasks associated with that occupation, some realistic and others more funny. For example, in the “Office Worker” simulation, players participate in activities like evaluating new employees and transferring calls, but are also called upon to eat doughnuts, share photos at the water cooler. Of course the fun part is the use of the motion controllers of the HTC Vive to represent their hands. Users interact with the virtual environment similarly to how they would in real life. And when the player completes all four job simulations, the have the chance to modify the physics of the gameplay. So, what’s the studio next plans and how Google is going to work with them?

Google Maps Local Guides cuts Level 4 free Drive storage from 1TB to 100GB Rita El Khoury Follow View All Posts 2016/07/07 4:27am PDTJul 7, 2016 135 Plus 1 on G+ 110 Share on Facebook 1 Share on Twitter Total Shares246 Google News Back in November of 2015, Google expanded its Local Guides program with a points and level system that introduced new rewards for each tier. At 200 points, you would reach the coveted Level 4 and receive 1TB of free Google Drive storage for 2 years. Now Google is backing away from that promise and lowering the amount of free storage to 100GB only. It might be that Google Maps' recent updates that incentivize you with notifications to post photos, reviews, and answer questions about places you're visiting have had a positive effect and Google is seeing more and more people reach Level 4. This is why, in order to provide everyone with free storage, it's lowering the amount to 100GB instead of 1TB. At least that's the reason given to Local Guides in a new email that's going out to them: As the corresponding Local Guides support document states, those who are already signed up to the program have until July 21 2016 to reach Level 4 and redeem their free 1TB Drive storage. After that date, or for those who aren't Local Guides yet, the free storage will go down to 100GB. Excuse me while I scramble to post all the photos and reviews that I've been putting off for months... and try to understand why of my 97 (mostly detailed) reviews, Local Guides is only counting 12.

Plucky Duck I've got 111 points, got invited to Local Guides event but rejected without any reason on Email. Trent Archer There will almost always be someone with more points than you. Posting numbers above the level 5 requirement just seems silly. catalysto Why? Not everyone contributes for personal gain. Some people actually enjoy it. Trent Archer Absolutely. I'm just saying that posting "I have x points, I'm great" sounds foolish, because someone will usually come along with a bigger number. Robert Johnson Yeah, of course, that's what I live for. https://youtu.be/jDN8Hv4kDuA Tomáš Petrík Well, that sucks. Ian Actually, there is a summit for Level 5 Local Guides. Being level 5 doesn't guarantee you a spot though, you have to apply. Jean-Ignace de Villenfagne Your are right Ian and others, there is well a Google Local Guide Summit organised by Google in SF mid September. For GLG level 5 who applied with video and high status in GLG program in their own country. We are only 75 around the world. I'm a GLG and GSVT photographer in Brussels and represent Belgium for GLG in SF this year. Name's Group is "The75". We are invited by Google, during 3 days and nights in SF to discover Google place and more about this program and will come back to our countries to tell everybody the news,... Maybe for you next year? good luck for everybody and enjoy it around you, for you and for national and international customers of shops, restaurants, hotels, touristic places, sports centers,... This is only the beginning and you are on the train ;-) Have fun. barnitka Got 2 weeks for my 43 remaining contributions. Ahoy reviews! Lynxy It's also very easy if a certain chain of whatever (coffee shops, gas stations etc) doesn't have listed opening hours yet. Just go from chain location to location and add their hours (they're probably listed for all chain locations on their website). Trent Archer I've found the easiest way to get points is edits to incorrect place names. I initially went with photos as so many places (especially in smaller towns) don't have a decent picture up, or any picture at all. Then I realised just how many places have names stuffed with keywords. For example, Costa Coffee Liverpool should actually just be called Costa, classified as a coffee shop and located in Liverpool. Wells Fargo Bank should just be Wells Fargo. A lot of people mistakenly think they're helping by putting keywords relevant to the business into its name and business owners think there's an advantage in it. In reality, it just leads to a less efficient, clean and tidy map. benoita74 Excellent tip thank you, got me a 100 points in 20 minutes ;) Stevie_Wonder Thanks! This worked for me too, got 150 points or something like that in an hour. And just got my 1TB Drive space. If it existed I voted for you for AndroidPolice commenter of the month! Vlad McDonald's drive throughs here are godsent. 24 hours all day every day without that noted. Moaaz Ahmad Never knew Google gave out free storage for reviews on Google Maps. No wonder I'm still at level 2. Great news for me :D Cody Toombs I have a nagging suspicion this is a carrot/stick solution to nudge people to hurry up and get some more submissions in. It's a short-term solution, but it'll definitely get some new content in place quickly. Now I gotta hurry up and fill out some points. I barely even use Drive storage, but you never know... Better to claim the higher storage limit now and not need it than to get it down the road and turn out to be desperate for more. benoita74 But then what's the use of having it for only two years ? Put up your lifelong photo collection on it just to have to put them somewhere else in two years, or, what I guess is Google's plan with this, start paying to be able to keep your photos online Trent Archer Clearly they don't want to upset people by making them lose their storage. Storage is dropping in price all the time for large buyers like Google, so by the time you're running out of time, chances are they'll either have a new promotion to keep it free, or will be charging a lot less for storage. XerBlade Google periodically throws out new Drive storage promotions. By the time that 2 years is up, he'll have it back from another promotion. Or two. Or three. I currently have 3 separate free 1TB storage for 2 years promotions running at the same time (seriously, just the 1TB promos, there are tons more smaller promos where those came from). The one from Local Guides level 4 expires at the end of 2017, while my latest still has until summer of 2018. benoita74 Wow never got more than 2Gigs! But then I guess living in France doesn't help ;) guy You used to get 1TB with new Samsung devices, but that has probably ended a few phones back Cody Toombs I already have promo storage from buying a phone early last year. It's going to run out sometime early next year. I'd like to claim this promo and avoid dealing with space limits for as long as I can. If I do suddenly need a lot of space, it's probably going to be for migrating a huge hard drive of backups or something like that. Either way, the worst I'm giving up is a few months 2 years from now. Truth be told, I care very little about the storage. I'm mostly looking at it as a prompt to get back to working up to level 5. pfmiller I agree, I'd much rather get just a few GB that I can keep rather than a huge amount that I will get used to just in time for them to take it away. Marcelove And i hope Cody you won't try what other users are proposing about reaching 200 points wrinting "OK place" reviews... That type of post isn't awarded any point, and even if some fake review could bypass the system and give a point to the user, not much later all the points earned that way are removed. Cody Toombs Do you see how much excess effort I put into my posts? I'm not the type of person that throws garbage out for other people. The few reviews I have written are legitimate and reasonably extensive. Besides, I don't write a lot of reviews. For one, I honestly don't think people read very many of those, so they aren't helping as much as people think they do. Second, I live in a small town where some businesses owners, employees, and even just fans can overreact to negative comments. It's not worth the grief. I tend towards taking pictures and answer questions. Bas Keetelaar I'm only on lvl 2 :( Trent Archer I'm not sure, but I imagine it has something to do with them likely revealing new reward tiers at the summit in September. There are a lot of people with thousands of points. Level 5 no longer being enough for some will lead to new tiers and they have to come up with new rewards. I'd be inclined to rejig things in their position. Eduardo This. Besides, it's really easy to get to level 4 if you are active. It's not just about submitting lengthy reviews. Answering questions, submitting pictures, editing places... you can get points out of everything. Lorenzo Faccini Reached it last week :D Wolfgang Schwach Getting to Level 4 is way too easy - I had reached it on joining the Local Guides program. Even getting to Level 5 just happened without too much effort. catalysto They should add more levels. Avieshek Rajkhowa I thought Google was rich? Leeroy Jenkins Just reached level 4. Theuntje So.. I get 14 days to collect 82 points.. This is disapointing.. Vlad I need 170 and I live in a small town. Cool. Theuntje It's not limited to your town.. You can search everything on Google and give feedback about it Vlad So basically I can spam all the McDonald's in my country with a 5-star rating and an "ok"? Trent Archer I doubt that's what was intended. You can make corrections to obvious errors. I spent a weekend (yes, this is very sad, I know lol) going to the capital city of every country and territory on earth that has Maps and making corrections to obvious errors. Eg Wells Fargo Bank should be Wells Fargo and Costa Coffee should be Costa. That netted me around 800 points within a few days, with the instantly accepted edits and those accepted soon afterwards. About a month later, it's likely well over 1,000 points for the time investment. Vlad Oh, or the hotel near me which is called "HOTEL RESTAURANT YAHOO BEST" for about... since Google Maps... Changed that to "Hotel YahooBest", as on the website. Pretty stupid how restaurant and hotel owners do absolutely 0 effort to even check their Google Maps entry... Anyways, with the help (or no help, thankfully) of my fellow Maps contributors, I am now at 151 points... And I actually feel like I helped. Trent Archer It's especially stupid as the Maps data is the first thing you see when you Google a business name or category in search results. Posting a few pictures to your Facebook page isn't nearly as helpful as business owners seem to think. Vlad It's weird how some restaurants here have no phone number on the map, but a Google search for them shows the phone number to the side, no idea where from. And it's the exact same place. Anjo Cerdeña It's possible that there are duplicate entries on the map: one with the number and one without. Depending on which country you're in, you can check this on Map Maker. Vlad They really should have an automated system for that... the biggest train station in my country apparently has 10 entries on the map. That's pretty incredible for such a high profile train station. Anjo Cerdeña Yeah, it's a far from perfect system at the moment. Even the Google bot on Map Maker keeps creating duplicates in my country. SB Same boat. v sad. johnforamerica I got about 70 in the last couple days... it can be done! guy I made about 190 points today. I just reviewed all the places I've been to, as I stopped reviewing things about a year ago, I had enough places. You don't have to write a paragraph for each place, two senteces that sums up the place will suffice (and most people will probably preffer that over a page worth of text). Don't be an asshole who writes "OK" on everything, but a sentence or two can be very helpful for everyone. Vinícius Souza Now lots of people that "wasted" time writing detailed and long reviews and rested in Level 2/3 (like the idiot here who types) will just join the huge boat of people that just write "OK place" and similar things to just reach higher levels faster for two weeks. Well done, Google! XerBlade I write long and detailed reviews, and as a result due to work I haven't actually had time to write a single review since late last year, and I still have been level 4 for ages. I mean, the majority of my points are from answers anyway. Vinícius Souza Yeah, me too. But I'm level 2 only with 29 points. Most of them are from answers, followed by photos, then reviews. I really hate all those flooded few words reviews. (Not to say all those with just "OK" or "cool" and etc!) I think reviews must be something really useful, like we find in Foursquare, for example. Jason Farrell Well, in the future Google should have the AI to score reviews better. Short & dumb, vs Pithy and smart, vs TLDR, vs SPAM, etc. Hamilton Jimenez Vasquez I thought the same thing, good bye to those detailed reviews, Im almost reaching level 4, 135 points, nothing is going to stop me to reach level 4 before that day, sorry Google. That's a bad move and you know it. kks Exactly. I always write long and detailed reviews. Now it's gonna be shitty reviews because they only reason i've been doing this is the 1tb. Eduardo You can also get lots of points by uploading pictures (once per place), suggesting edits on wrong places or missing information and answering questions. It's not all about the reviews Trent Archer Indeed. I've found that edits (particularly to keyword stuffed names) and photos are the quickest, easiest points to be had. Both are also of particular help to Maps users. Hamilton Jimenez Vasquez True, but the reviews are the quickly way to get points. Actually I just reached level 4 just right now writing few more reviews, I had 134 points and now I have 200 points and that only took me 15 minutes writing not very detailed reviews, but shorts ones. I do upload pictures every now and then but I dont think is fair receiving only 1 point per place, if you depend on phone then its gonna take for ever. johnforamerica Review > answer questions > POINTS! Hamilton Jimenez Vasquez Right! that's another faster way to get points, just few clicks, not typing or taking photos is needed. Marcelove Shitty review aren't awarded with points... Try doing that, wait for 24 hours, and you will see any of your reviews will earn you points.... Marcelove Shitty review aren't awarded with points... Try doing that, wait for 24 hours, and you will see any of your reviews will earn you points... Rob Paek I'm one of them! Well, not quite empty reviews but at least I'm writing something. More on places I like. johnforamerica I'm exactly like you. I'll take my time to share insight on places where it makes sense, but what can I really say about a Bojangles I drove through ("pretty typical Bojangles experience. They didn't screw up my order and service was quick.") or gas station where I got gas ("paid at the pump. No issues, place was well lit.")?! Rob Paek Exactly! Marcelove You won't gain any points doing that... If you don't belive me, try it... Tizio Caio Those "reviews" were removed by Google for spam, and didn't give points Corey Watford Smh, 100pts away from level 4 and really the whole reason why I signed up was for the 1TB 2yr Bonus. Oh well good timing I guess, just purchased Office 365, and get 1TB per year for $30bucks. (office 365 is dirt cheap on eBay) Marcellus1 I'm 138 points away. Don't think it's happening for me... F4LL0U7 I was lucky enough to get the 1TB before they announced this, so I'm assuming I get to keep it for the full 2 years. But does anyone know what happens after the 2 years? Does it just disappear, or is there any opportunity to keep it for free? Or would I just have to pay for it? Luis Gustavo I think they will advise you and you can't upload nothing more until you free the storage until your original limit. MAYBE Colin Richardson 12 points away... I need to review something.. ANYTHING.. LOL johnforamerica Go to your "contributions" and answer questions! Or review places you've been if you have location services on! Colin Richardson Yes, that is how I got to only 12 points away. Colin Richardson No worries, I went deeper and deeper into my history, The one that taken me over the 200 boarder was a Train Station Carpark.. Not the train station.. The Carpark for it... Sigh.... Prahlis Then fuck it Madis Otenurm Tip: answer questions for easy points. If not available in your region, just set phone language to English and use the app. Indianajonze eh i'm answering dozens of questions and it doesn't seem like my points are increasing... nxtiak You only get 1 point per venue. Not 1 point per question. Indianajonze well that makes sense i guess but they should specify that when they ask me 5-6 questions per venue johnforamerica Not trying to be a jerk, but it seems pretty clear to me... Madis Otenurm As the description says, updating points can take up to 24 hours. René Simonsen Well, there goes that incentive Vagif Zeynalov Boooo Google! Ricardo Ca 100G for one year. Kyle Bailey That was easy enough, just jumped from lvl 2 to lvl 4 JD Well back to Doing stuff for Yelp at least you can earn Elite Status and that gains you access to events. Ankit Gupta I would love to get 10 GB of permanent storage rather than 100 GB for 2 years. Ricardo Ca Me too. Greg Miernicki ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ 1 gig free each year for the security checkup... keep playing that game and you will get your 10gb perm ;D Ankit Gupta It's actually 2GB per year, and I have already got 4 GB through that route :) Surfine Could you link me to this security checkup? Tiuri Elvander https://security.google.com/settings/security/secureaccount?pli=1 Don't think you'll get the 2GB now though. Wait till Google announce it. Ankit Gupta I guess it was available on Feb 8 only. http://www.androidpolice.com/2016/02/08/google-is-once-again-offering-2gb-of-free-drive-space-if-you-complete-the-account-security-checkup/ Ricardo Ca That's a great idea. Would be nice if Google listened to we have to say. Rob Paek I wouldn't mind if it were 100 GB as long as you are active every year or quarter, not just 2 years. They want you to use up all that storage and then get you to pay for it after your free storage expires lol Andrei D. Considering they are about to make photo contributions much faster and easier (mostly automatic) I imagine lots of people will surge in points and thus levels. Jason Farrell I say good. We know that Google can afford giving out the Drive space (esp. with storage growing exponentially), but Google's data probably shows that 1TB probably incentivized a higher volume of crap reviews. 100G == a normal volume of higher quality reviews & photos. johnforamerica Turn on location services! Google will serve you up questions about (and the opportunity to review) places you forgot you even went! Ricardo Ca I contribute normally, only when going to someplace new, etc, the space limited in time holds no stimulus for me. 1T or 100G if will disappear after a time makes little sense in my opinion. Should be like Ankit Gupta suggested, less space permanently. Anirudh Niyogi Thank-you Rita as always very Informative and useful articles at the Right time ! This is the reason I Visit Android Police every day .. Shagnscooby I just went from Level 2 to Level 4 just at lunch today to get the 1TB, so it's pretty easy to get to that level without trying too hard. Tiuri Elvander Impressive Tiuri Elvander I'd better hurry then. Tiuri Elvander Done, from level 3, circa 120 points to level 4, 206 points in under 2 hours. Got my 1 TB (for 2 years anyway) Alexander Wow, thanks for sharing. I knew about the programm and participated a little bit, but I did not know about benefits. Wrote reviews this evening for every place I've been last half year and got exactly 4th level. Hope to get my TB now :) Shall I claim it or what? Saiprasad sunny Today luckily. i got 1tb safe 😂 Drakenoid Thanks for the headsup!!! I reached level 4 in a few minutes!!! My town is like empty in terms of these things, so I just had everything to fill in! :D Fifth313ment I have answered a ton of questions written hundreds of reviews and my pictures have been seen like 100k times in one month yet I'm still a level 3. Google doesn't even show an accurate number of anything! And what good is 2TB if the take it back at the end of two years? So what I see I have two terabytes and then fill it up with everything on my backups and then after two years I need to either buy the 2TB back or delete everything?! No thank you! M. Hamza I got 1 TB on 5th of July. Quite lucky I am.. Matt Hughes Surprised nobody mentioned this, but the benefit also changed from 2 years to a single year. This is a 95% reduction compared to 1tb for 2 years. Ben Klock Word! Pete Smith I was seriously considering paying to upgrade to the 1TB for but now I won't need to - went from about 80 points to 205 in the last day once I read this page. Didn't know one of the benefits was free storage before now, Google didn't make it obvious.

How do I unlock the 1tb bonus? Thanks. Simon Redeem here: https://www.google.com/local/guides/home Got it today Ade Adeleye Thanks Simon. Unfortunately I only get 100gb as I signed up after the date. Still great though. matiy Just got to level 4... Not satisfied at all.. Just 100 GB for 1 year only..... In OneDrive I got 45 GB for free and forever without doing anything. Ricardo Ca Exactly. Less space permanently. matiy I have a question.. Before, when it was 1TB, was it for lifetime or just for a year like now? Ricardo Ca Two years Ian I know this is very late but Google also changed the time from two to one year, without telling anyone. So now you get a tenth the storage for half the time.

It seemed inevitable that these companies would at some point be blamed for the misuse of these forums and become targets of lawsuits from families of victims. A lawsuit filed in a federal court in California by the father of Nohemi Gonzalez, a victim of the Paris terror attack in November, charges that Twitter, Facebook and Google “have knowingly permitted the terrorist group ISIS [Islamic State group] to use their social networks as a tool for spreading extremist propaganda, raising funds and attracting new recruits.” Gonzalez, a U.S. citizen, was killed in November when militants sprayed bullets into the bistro at which she was dining with friends. A similar suit has been brought against Twitter in January by the widow of a person killed in Jordan. In that lawsuit as also the lawsuit filed by Nohemi's father, Reynaldo Gonzalez, the companies are likely to invoke Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which states that "no provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider." That provision protects online intermediaries from being held responsible for content hosted on their websites by third parties, which in this case would include the ISIS. Congress has "broadly immunized entities like Twitter against lawsuits that seek to hold them liable for harmful or unlawful third-party content, including suits alleging that such entities failed to block, remove, or alter such content," Twitter said in its defense in the January lawsuit. The January complaint does not allege any direct connection between Twitter and the killer Anwar Abu Zaid or the attack on the police compound in Jordan that killed Lloyd Fields, the victim in the attack, Twitter said. "Nor does it allege that Twitter itself created any of the Tweets, messages, or other content that the Complaint strains to link, even indirectly, to that attack," it added. The Gonzalez complaint alleges that the three companies provided material support to terrorists under 18 U.S. Code 2339A and 2339B. “The services and support that Defendants purposefully, knowingly or with willful blindness provided to ISIS constitute material support to the preparation and carrying out of acts of international terrorism, including the attack in which Nohemi Gonzalez was killed,” according to the complaint filed Tuesday. The complaint cites numerous instances of the misuse of the networks by the ISIS and also points to the revenue earned by the companies by placing advertisements on posts by the terrorists groups. “Astonishingly, Defendants routinely profit from ISIS. Each Defendant places ads on ISIS postings and derives revenue for the ad placement,” according to the filing. Social networks for their part claim they are doing their best to weed out terrorist content though it is turning out to be like trying to whack-a-mole, with the proscribed content or new content resurfacing elsewhere. YouTube has a strong track record of taking swift action against terrorist content, said a Google spokesman, who said the company would not comment on pending litigation. “We have clear policies prohibiting terrorist recruitment and content intending to incite violence and quickly remove videos violating these policies when flagged by our users. We also terminate accounts run by terrorist organizations or those that repeatedly violate our policies," he wrote in an email. A Facebook spokeswoman wrote that “there is no place for terrorists or content that promotes or supports terrorism on Facebook, and we work aggressively to remove such content as soon as we become aware of it." A Twitter spokesman said “violent threats and the promotion of terrorism deserve no place on Twitter and, like other social networks, our rules make that clear.” In a post on combating violent extremism in February, Twitter said that as noted by many experts and other companies, “there is no ‘magic algorithm’ for identifying terrorist content on the internet, so global online platforms are forced to make challenging judgment calls based on very limited information and guidance.” Gonzalez is asking the court for compensatory damages to be decided in a trial. The lawsuit is likely to add to other pressures the social networking companies are already facing on the terror issue from various quarters including Congress. Senators Dianne Feinstein, a Democrat from California, and Richard Burr, a Republican from North Carolina, for example, proposed legislation in December that would require tech companies to report online terrorist activity to law enforcement.

Google's "Project Treble" will modularize Android to make updates faster Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/05/12 12:42pm PDTMay 12, 2017 95 Plus 1 on G+ 162 Share on Facebook 76 Share on Twitter Total Shares333 Android O Android OS Development Google News Easily the most annoying aspect of using an Android phone (with the exception of Pixel/Nexus) is slow updates. Android 7.1 (which came out last year) currently sits at 0.5% marketshare, and brand new phones are still being released with 6.0 Marshmallow. Google is aiming to solve this with "Project Treble," which will modularize part of the Android OS to decrease the time OEMs spend updating their devices. If you're not familiar with how Android updates work, here's a summary. Google releases a new Android version, which silicon manufacturers (e.g. Qualcomm, Mediatek) have to supply drivers for. Once that's done, device makers (e.g. Samsung, HTC) can start re-adding all the tweaks they have made to the new Android source code. In the case of carrier-sold phones/tablets, device makers then have to wait for the carriers to approve the update. After all that is done, users finally start to receive the update. Google is hoping to speed up this process with Project Treble, which changes the architecture of Android. Essentially, a new 'Vendor interface' will contain all of the low-level software for a device - like the chipset drivers. Google will work with chipset manufacturers to make sure the Vendor interface is forwards-compatible, and the interface will be validated by a Vendor Test Suite (VTS). The aspect of this news I'm most excited about is that the Vendor interface is forwards-compatible. There have been many cases where chipset manufacturers have not updated drivers for specific popular chips, preventing devices using them from being officially updated to newer Android versions. One example is the Nexus 5 and other Snapdragon 800/801-based devices, which were never officially updated to 7.0 Nougat. It sounds like the Vendor interface will prevent this from happening, or at least prolong the end of support for a given chip. Google says that Android O will be the first version to use the new Vendor interface, and the Android O Developer Preview already has it. Hopefully we'll hear more about Project Treble at Google I/O next week. Source: Android Developers Tags Android android o project treble treble vendor interface vendor test suite vts subscribe ...

Hopefully this means Google can update more core system functions similar to Google Play Services independent of the OEM/carrier path. Mike Updates still have to go through carriers, this just helps prevent devices from early EoL and should make OEMs jobs easier by not having to rewrite every piece of code to work with new drivers. TechGuy22 that's why this is useless. carriers are still involve and OEM like samsung takes time with their own skin destinyhud thats why i buy pixel. also, like mentioned this will reduce the amount of modification needed in android's new version which means slightly early release. even if its 2 weeks early i am good wit it TechGuy22 or or you can push google to make things easier for carriers and OEMs and not bandages i have an S7 edge and a pixel xl. go figure Taco Monster You can't make things easy for someone who doesn't want to do said things. bekifft It's why I buy Pixel too but the whole point of Android was supposed to be freedom and choice. If my only real choices are Google or Apple, I might as well buy a damn iPhone. PI This Daniel Not necessarily. All the OEM has to do is bring their crap (skin) from the last android version. Of course that probably only happen with small android updates (8.1?) Zsolt V Why shouldn't they? By all accounts, they add value so it's worth the wait. CA-Sandra Fuchsia is a very long term project. It's not going to replace Android anytime soon. Dextro I've been saying for ages that Android needs an hardware abstraction in the vein of what Windows has in its driver model. Hopefully this is it and helps get those updates out faster. Sadly I expect that the endless stream of UI customization OEM make will end up killing any kind of benefit this brings. Corbin Davenport I want something like that too, but I'm not deeply familiar with the technical structure of Linux/Android, so I would assume sure there some massive limitation that is keeping that from happening. Dextro I think (but am now 100% sure on this so don't quote me) that Linux historically hasn't had any such abstraction. Drivers are meant to be inside the kernel and compiled for each specific version. That works fine if the code is open source and committed to the kernel repos but it becomes a nightmare for binary blobs. The kernel makes no allowances for stable driver APIs, they will break stuff and won't worry for anything outside of the kernel if I remember correctly. That's probably part of the reason why Android has failed to keep up with Linux kernel versions. keithzg The kernel makes no allowances for stable driver APIs, they will break stuff and won't worry for anything outside of the kernel if I remember correctly. I wouldn't really say this is true. In fact, there is a very stable API provided by the Linux kernel. Hell, one of the most famous Linus rants was about this very topic: It's a bug alright - in the kernel. How long have you been a maintainer? And you *still* haven't learnt the first rule of kernel maintenance? If a change results in user programs breaking, it's a bug in the kernel. We never EVER blame the user programs. How hard can this be to understand? WE DO NOT BREAK USERSPACE! https://lkml.org/lkml/2012/12/23/75 Obviously drivers are trickier, but they're still expected to continue working. The big catch comes in that ARM drivers tend to come as compiled binary blobs. There really isn't an allowance for that in the workflow of things for Linux; good citizens are supposed to provide source, and then new kernel versions and the drivers therefore (often within the kernel itself) are recompiled, and everyone's happy. But while the API remains the same, the ABI does not; drivers compiled as modules for an older kernel won't work on newer ones, even though the drivers would almost certainly work fine if they were recompiled. The ARM space is utterly lousy with proprietary drivers (in no small part this is Qualcomm's fault, although they're far from the only offender). Hence you have Google forever backporting kernel updates to older kernels, so that the ABI remains consistent and older device drivers continue working. Dextro Well, I stand corrected then. But one question then: I was under the impression that drivers were not in userspace but in kernelspace. That's why I didn't even think much of that famous Linus rant. keithzg True, they're (generally; FUSE, for instance, is an area of exception) in kernel space, and that rant isn't entirely applicable because of that, but for practical purposes that just means ABI changes break drivers. And the kernel devs do reserve the right to change the in-kernel API at any point, which could in theory break drivers---it's just that in practice they are rather worried about such breakage and don't wish to do so, and barely break it more than they do userspace. When you think about it, it'd kindof be an insane amount of maintenance if people had to update driver code for new kernel versions! Luckily for "desktop Linux", most drivers these days in the x86 space are open source (NVIDIA is remaining holdout, although even there you can fall back to the Nouveau drivers most of the time), so they're just baked into the kernel or provided as kernel modules, and in practice don't really have to be touched by human hands after they're originally written. Unluckily for Android, that is very much not true in the ARM hardware world. Hell, most Chinese OEMs will just flatly refuse to provide kernel source, even though they're legally obligated to do so. Gaurav Kumar Which is why fuchsia has a stable ABI...like windows. I agree it's not coming anytime soon but it may not be that far away as well.. Lawstorant in the linux world, the answer is DKMS. There's no need for kernel catch-up anymore. I bet Google is doing something similar. Сергей Бугаев Android has the HAL https://source.android.com/devices/#Hardware-Abstraction-Layer -- but it haven't been helping much, as we can see (or would it be much worse without it?). It'd be interesting to see more technical details about Tremble to understand how it's different. Andy J https://developer.android.com/things/index.html pretty much this is what they are aiming for - from the days of Project Brillo. "System updates and support: We provide the system image, updates, fixes, and more, so you can focus on creating compelling products" Brillo/Things is the same idea - there is the low level vendor stuff, the actual OS and then the OEM stuff. Google can update the OS on running devices in the field, without worrying about the vendor stuff or the OEM stuff. Knowledgeborn Allah Exactly... And, unfortunately, this probably isn't going to be anything like Microsoft's new update process for Windows 10 Mobile, which doesn't have to go through carriers. Based on all the software modifications most Android OEMs make with their devices, this probably won't speed up OS updates at all. More powerful devices may last slightly longer, but that will still leave it to the OEMs to support those devices for longer periods, and they likely won't do that anyway, since they're constantly trying to get you to purchase the next one... Zsolt V Windows 10 what? Knowledgeborn Allah Dismissing Windows 10 Mobile (and rightly so) doesn't change the fact that Android needs to learn a few things from them. Their update process, at least right now, is still miles ahead of anything Android is doing. Google should've followed the path that Microsoft already laid when it comes to updating software systems outside of the carriers. It looks like they took one thing that's beneficial but disregarded all the other necessary parts... ¯_(ツ)_/¯ Zsolt V As in how to drop 50% of the devices with the Creators update? No, thanks, Google has nothing to learn from that process. Knowledgeborn Allah Again, you're still missing the point... This isn't about dropping support for any devices with the Creators' update. This is specifically about them bypassing carriers to directly deliver updates to their consumers, which they can sustain for longer periods of time. Google has a lot to learn from that process. Zsolt V Doesn't matter. The end result is the same, the user doesn't get an update. You are missing the point, maybe you don't have one? Knowledgeborn Allah Maybe I don't have one? You sound like an idiot, bud... Maybe you have difficulty reading. I specifically stated in my original post, which you replied to, what the point was: "And, unfortunately, this probably isn't going to be anything like Microsoft's new update process for Windows 10 Mobile, which doesn't have to go through carriers." Again, the point was based on the fact that Windows 10 Mobile updates - regardless of how many people actually have Windows 10 Mobile devices, or how many devices will be discontinued due to the Creators' update - don't have to go through carriers. That's the point. Android as a platform can learn a lot from that. Before making ridiculous replies about a subject and, in effect, making yourself look dumb, maybe you should read the post you're replying to first. Just a thought. PVL_93_RU Windows 10 mobile is dead Knowledgeborn Allah https://www.onmsft.com/news/latest-windows-10-mobile-updates-bypass-carriers-update-phones-directly Say what your want about Windows 10 Mobile when it comes to development, but it's definitely not a good look when a "dead" platform can update their devices better than Android can. 🤦🏾‍♂️ Robabobbob So which windows phone OEM is actually making a modification anything close to what android OEMs do? Knowledgeborn Allah That's not the point... The point is that you can separate core Android OS functions from the themes and launchers inherent in other variations of Android provided by other OEMs. Right now, Android's update process is a disaster. Even after the OEMs push out updates to their devices, it still has to go through various carriers to actually get to consumers, showing that the carriers are actually the ones in charge. Windows 10 doesn't have that problem. iOS doesn't have that problem. Android has that problem. bekifft I agree completely about the HAL, but the real problem remains the network operators retaining strict control over user devices. If AT&T doesn't want to spend the money to add AT&T Navigator, AT&T Device Locator, AT&T Messages, etc etc etc, they will simply not deploy the update. SomeGuy112 This is great, gives the potential for much longer OS update support, especially for Googles own hardware. Hopefully the OG Pixel gets longer than 2 year OS support because of this. destinyhud good point Dn Bro Didn't the article say the new devices with O will have this? DragoCubed The dev preview for the pixel has this project. We can assume it's staying with the pixel MrHanMan So, is it Trebble, or Treble? Jdban Treble according to the google docs Corbin Davenport It is Treble, I can't spell. Fixed. Jeff The trouble with Trebbles... destinyhud i really hope this fixes the 2 week delay in getting major update to nexus devices /s John Doe This is good but Google need to do more. They need to modularize everything in the Android update process. Create a separate carrier update so the baseband can be updated separate from the OS and same to drivers and also OEM skins/Apps. This should have FIVE different updates paths: 1) Core OS/Kernel update path 2) Driver update path 3) Baseband/Carrier related Apps update path 4) OEM Skin/Apps path 5) Security update path This way Google can control the Security, Core OS, Baseband, and Drivers by working with carriers and silicon manufacturers. Also if T-Mobile for example wants to push an update out for the baseband and messaging/phone apps they can do that independent of Google and OEMs. The same goes for Samsung and Qualcomm and others. Latheryin You are confused on one part. What you call skins are not what you think they are. All of the OEM versions of android are completely different distros that replace core OS files and frameworks with their versions. John Doe I know but If Google were to modularize it then it would just be a "skin" or "theme" that is separate from the framework/OS this will give Google control over the main OS and the only way to do that is to not allow OEMs to modify it too much. Latheryin Which would remove all the extra features that devices add on. Many have to be tied into the frameworks and other base OS drivers and libs. There is no separation in it really. And with the way they licensed Android they cant really control a whole lot. Any OEM could easily reverse anything Google does and still release it. John Doe Well yeah of course Google can't do that alone they would have to make new agreements with OEMs and carriers. Most OS skins do not have that many extra features and Google can create APIs to allow OEMs to modify anything they want like if Samsung wants to add an Iris scanner as a password or whatever. The point is OEM "skins" need to become more like launchers in the play store like Nova and Apex and If OEMs want to modify something they would have to ask Google like how Microsoft treats windows. Latheryin You really dont have a great understanding of how things work. That will never hap=p=en. Maybe with Googles second mobile OS they might try to have more control. John Doe How about instead of being an arrogant prick, you tell me what I said is incorrect or what Google cannot do? Why do you think this cannot happen? Microsoft did this with Windows mobile. Like I said, Google would have to sign new licensing agreements with OEMs and Carriers but they probably have to revise it for this Project Treble anyways. Google already uses its Apps and Play store as a bargaining chip to update those agreements. Latheryin Ok first. Google would have to change the license under which android is licensed. Which can't be done. Also have you ever ripped Android apart and had a look? I would guess not as if you had we would not be talking about this. As for what we does does. That really is apples and oranges. Not even close e same thing. The apps and play store are not really that big of a deal. There are hundreds of android devices released every year that don't include them and they sell really well. John Doe You said NOTHING I have not said already. Why Google cannot change the Android license? What stops Google from implementing this since you are the Genius that ripped Android apart and decided this cannot be done? Google already has MADAs in place and they update them every few years with OEMs. Those devices are mostly in China since Google services are banned there. If the Play store is not a big deal then Samsung would have forked Android a long time ago. But go ahead I am still waiting for your "intelligent" replies. Even Amazon's fire phone failed miserably without the play store and Google apps. Latheryin Have you even read the license? Do you really have any idea what happens when something is licensed? Doesn't take that much really. Anyone can look at the code. Heck some of the best android developers are teens. Samsung already did. It's called tizen. Also Samsung is not the end all of devices. They even have a separate store for the devices they run with Android. All Samsung apps don't even hit the Play store. They are Android devices for the common man. Made for everyday people. Ask your favorite developer what device he runs. Look if you want to know more why not dig in, instead of trying to get into a tech conversation when you don't really know too much about it. John Doe Licenses can be updated and their MADAs can be updated which they already do. Samsung did not fork Android, they created a different OS. And that is not turning out very well for them. You still have not told me how what I said cannot be implemented. You should go get one of those Teen Android developers to help you out before you just turn down ideas that you have know nothing about. If Google wanted to they can change Android to how Windows does updates there is nothing stopping them from doing that and OEMs will not fork Android if they did that. I love how you just criticize arguments without providing valid reasons instead of just saying Android does not allow you to do that provide factual reasons or STFU. klaus666 Could this also help to port LineageOS to a smartphone once LineageOS is adapted to this new modular system? jgarrido I dunno, sounds like treble to me... JD OK I get that Google is essentially making what in the Windows World is the HAL and breaking that out of the Kernel and they're essentially creating a lower level API (For lack of a better term) to segment off Android from the OEM mods. However what is actually stopping the OEMs from sayin' fuck this ain't working out let me go in there and refork it anyway. I mean API's are there, now and OEMs should be using that to interact with Android but Android is coming up short so they fork it and custom build the ROM with their own customization and branches. For the longest time the camera stack was a HUGE reason for doing this, even now the Camera2 API is still coming up short, which is why Samsung Completely branches on their own for that too. freshprince_87 Google simply needs to make it mandatory for carriers /OEMS to update their devices and release new phones in the most current version of Android Adnoxaei They could make it a requirement for access to the Play store. Without this interface, that would have been very restrictive. With this interface, customizations can still easily exist, so companies may be more willing to cooperate...espevially if it cuts down on the time needed to test and deploy updates boop By the sound of it, the Vendor Interface is for SoC manufacturers, not device makers. jcopernicus Sweet! Can't wait for my Z3 Compact to get this update! NubCake This doesn't sound like a treble idea at all, hopefully it helps the slow updating process. Knowledgeborn Allah I see what you did there... 🙄😂 ddevito No bass.... Tom Westrick But what if a user is all about that bass? Killa Then they might be in treble if that's all they are about. Sorry, couldn't help myself. :P Emergency Medical Hologram Bassed on what? Martheen Cahya Paulo There's plenty of tweeter surrounding it. Dolby so if we consider the stereo type. Testraindrop While this is certainly a step in the right direction, I somehow doubt that this will change Googles attitude to abandon their own devices after 2 years. Its not like the SOC in the Nexus 5 stopped working when N was installed, in fact its working fine, developed by independent individuals without having "to work with chipset manufacturers", which Google apparently couldn't even achieve. Also the times where google stops updates for the N6 and the Pixels is already set, so even with a chipset blob that is "forwards-compatible" there wont be any further (official) updates. Also if those Vendor APIs will have limits to certain OS aspects like camera, sound etc., then manufacturers will not use them and will just fork again the OS as done currently. saf1927 The custom ROMs that work on Nexus 5 devices don't actually benefit from a lot of things that an officially supported device would. Qualcomm has completely abandoned the chip so from a retail perspective, it's not suitable anymore. Even the "security updates" that these ROMs show in "About phone" aren't actually all implemented, since none of the proprietary blobs and binaries could be updated. Just because a device can be updated with a custom ROM, doesn't mean it's actually running it well. someone755 "Just because it's running it well doesn't mean it's running it well." Welp. saf1927 Wait, what? I can't find that sentence anywhere and I don't remember editing the comment. AbdulB1 Mediatek and in some cases​ Qualcomm (for Nexus 5,sd800,801) don't want people to stay on old phones they try to force them to buy new phones for latest Android version. I am not sure will they be happy about this change? I suspect they will flood market with phones running Android nougat instead. They will try to resist this change by Google. saf1927 Mediatek and Qualcomm aren't device makers, they are silicon manufacturers. AbdulB1 Mediatek charges device makers for new drivers for latest Android versions. Qualcomm stopped supporting sd 800/801 for Android Nougat and thus even sony a device maker who was developing Android N developer versions for a SD800/801 stopped. Chipset makers also have huge clout , it not just sensor makers who decide to support or not their older hardware for newer Android release. saf1927 Well, my point is that none of the silicon manufacturers will force anyone to make only Nougat phones, like you claimed. AbdulB1 "Google will work with chipset manufacturers to make sure the Vendor interface is forwards-compatible, and the interface will be validated by a Vendor Test Suite (VTS)." so if Vendor dont get validated for VTS then do you expect any chances of Android O for those devices? dizel123 I suspect if OEMs want to release new phones with the latest OS version because that's what their users want(I know I'm making assumptions) and Mediatek and Qualcomm try to force them to release phones with Nougat, then Intel will suddenly become a dominant player in the mobile market. This would be exactly the kind of "in" they're praying for. AbdulB1 Intel architecture is quite old , I owned 2 Intel based Android tablets. Intel even didn't bothered to upgrade the OS from 4.0.4 and other one had 5.0 as latest release even it though it was buggy as hell and every hardware vendor went for 5.1 instead. Intel had an edge of running windows along android on their cpu tech. But lack of proper built in modem destroyed their chances in Android world. Their SOCs still had quite high consumption even after releasing newer and newer generations of Mobile SOCs. dizel123 I don't have any inside information, but I'm guessing Intel is working on fixing their problems and making high quality SOCs Cakefish Intel dropped out of the mobile SOC wars. It cancelled development of all upcoming chips last year, I believe. dizel123 Their announcement at this year's Mobile World Congress as well as their current road map on their website both indicate that they're still developing mobile SOCs Cakefish So has it changed since this? -> http://www.anandtech.com/show/10288/intel-broxton-sofia-smartphone-socs-cancelled dizel123 Read my last comment again Lateef Alabi-Oki Jesus! What took them so long? pfmiller I believe there are performance costs to adding hardware abstraction. Google may feel that mobile hardware is finally at a point where it's worth the cost. Justin Martin This was my question. What is it going to do to performance. Not that I'm a Samsung user, but how much will touch wiz suck now? AbdulB1 Will it help in churning out custom ROMs? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I actually want the vendors to work on Android itself, not just their layer. They fix a lot of the bugs that Google leaves in. saf1927 They are already working on that: "In addition to the architectural changes, we're working with our silicon and device partners to take their code changes, such as features for a carrier network in a specific country, and move them into the common Android Open Source Project (AOSP) codebase. For example, Sony and Qualcomm contributed dozens of features and hundreds of bugfixes to Android O so they no longer need to rework these patches with each new release of Android." Simply put, some vendors contribute more than others. Sony is a great example in that regard. They contribute a lot. dizel123 This might just be the best thing Google has ever done to Android Eddie Ringle If you want to see more technical details, here's a bit of what I found back in March when the Developer Preview was released: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13928385 SHunter Orrrrr.... https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/7b191be55920725d6f6aba09c97c1e1942bdfb290cb4cf53e2cb9e23c706626c.png Eumelanin Knight Better late than never. Let's hope Carriers and Manufactures don't have their way and muck this up some how. bekifft At least they're being up front about the problem finally and making it an official "project." It seems like every year the promise is "we're fixing battery this time" and "we're fixing updates." Every year. Never gets better. And with the current FCC and the network operators only set to get worse about their abusive practices, I don't hold out much hope for this plan. What it boils down to is if there is any possible way for network operators (carriers) to meddle with the update, they will. This practice truly aught to be illegal, but see above. Maybe this will at least help lazy to the point of negligence OEMs (Lenovo) not be so appallingly slow. Islam sounds like a joke to me. John C.S. Lock When you finally giving up on Android after 10 long years , here we come iOS ! charfarstar I'll believe when Pixel 2 comes with 4 years of OS updates. MeCampbell30 Turn the treble up in my headphones. Régis Knechtel OMG! I can't believe they're finally doing something about it! https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/5acada086a36a588b7289e5b2a26d7c5f205e0b15a6c77c9b631f1a387dc8d2a.gif Cypher Hey guys and gals, let's add more abstraction to make this slug of an OS even slower! But hey, at least you'll get more frequent updates so that it can get slower more often! xyz People have been telling Google to use their muscle with the chipset makers forever. Qualcomm didn't release drivers is not an acceptable reason to not update Android. Sir_Brizz Hardware manufacturer doesn't release drivers is a perfectly acceptable reason not to update. Consumers should level their hatred at the right target. Blaming Samsung, for example, for Qualcomm's shortcoming won't change Qualcomm's policies. Andy J So last year it was A/B updates from Project Brillo and this year it's the ability to update the OS independently from the low level chipset drivers and the OEM stuff - which is also something Google developed for Project Brillo. While there are no actual Project Brillo / Android Things products in the market yet - it was definitely a worthwhile project for them with these rewards. (Yes I'm aware Chromebooks had A/B updates - but from everything I have heard, they still came about because of Project Brillo, even if Project Brillo wasn't an actual thing when they found their way to Chromebooks) kelpa32 it take google untill android O to try to get updates on time. Urmil Shroff Am I dreaming? Is this really going to happen? PI -This things don't work as u r expecting it ., Google can make guidelines but cant force OEMs to follow it . Oem will still not pass this ,, they will rant about high testing methods and quality benchmarks , ultimately they will pass it for devices only which they want (flagships) only ,, PVL_93_RU This is huge for Android in general. Of course the ideal way of doing things is following ChromeOS model where Google is entirely in charge of managing and updating the software, but then we'd lose out on what makes android unique, which is OEM skins Still though, modular updates are hopefully the next step that will really accelerate how fast devices receive OS updates. Especially mid-range and budget models Patel Nisha I swear I see something like this for every release but yet never happens Paul It's all fine and dandy but I suspect most phone companies still wont upgrade them because they want us to upgrade to newer phones so keeping older phones on older firmwares is in their interest so I don't think much will change. In any event, I'm happy that Google is doing this because it's one less excuse phone companies have to not upgrade their phones, but personally, I think Android could do with something like what Windows does with upgrades so almost any hardware can upgrade to the latest Androids without the manufaturas getting in the way. TonGi018 This is really exciting news! Android Developer Will this also lead to more updates, over a longer period of time ? boop Potentially, as it eliminates the forced EoL when the SoC manufacturer drops support, but it's still up to OEM and Carriers to develop and distribute updated. Android Developer Maybe for Google Pixel , at least? Maybe more than 2 years of updates?

Now some former standout engineers at Google and Facebook are using mobile phone data to try and make it safer. What they're finding— by using artificial intelligence to analyze massive amounts of driver information— may radically change how auto insurance is priced. Tech CEOs often start their companies to eliminate an obstacle they've encountered in their personal lives. Often called 'pain points' in Silicon Valley, two famous ones include Mark Zuckerberg wanting to meet more Harvard coeds and Travis Kalanick waiting too long for a ride. But when Jonathan Matus reveals why he founded Zendrive, whose software is used to analyze driving behavior, the pain he talks about is more visceral. "More people die in car accidents than in wars in Israel" said Matus, an Israeli-American, when asked where he got the idea for the company. When he heard that statistic about his home country, Matus correctly deduced the reason: more drivers distracted by mobile phones. It's the same in the U.S., where traffic fatalities are now going up after decades of decline. More than 40,000 Americans were killed in car accidents in 2016, a 14 percent rise since 2014, according to the National Safety Council. That's the biggest two-year surge in five decades. So Matus, who helped turn Google's Android into the world's dominant mobile software and later led the launch of Facebook's mobile platform, teamed up with another Google engineer, Pankaj Risbood, and in 2013 founded Zendrive. "We can use smartphone data to save lives," Matus told CNBC in an interview. A whole lotta data Matus got his start in the smartphone world at Google in 2007, where he was a marketing manager for Android as it grew from nothing to the most popular mobile platform. Then he moved to Facebook, where he helped launch its mobile platform. So Matus knows mobile. And when he talks about data, he means a whole lot of it. As of this week, Zendrive has analyzed 15 billion miles of driving, captured through a variety of applications and hardware that commercial fleet owners use to track driver safety. Zendrive also has partnerships with consumer apps, including Life360 and HopSkipDrive, to collect information about how drivers with those apps are operating. That 15 billion miles of analysis is more than Uber has, Matus claims, and almost as much as Progressive Insurance, which said last May it hit that same milestone — after nearly two decades of data collection. Zendrive has also looked at crash data through partnerships with Ford and BMW. "We crashed hundreds of cars with BMW," Matus says. After looking at all this data, Zendrive found that accidents are usually caused by four high-risk behaviors: speeding, hard braking, acceleration and phone use — a study Zendrive released last month showed that 88 percent of drivers are on their mobile phones while driving. show chapters Complacency is killing us on distracted driving: Nat'l Safety Council    Tuesday, 23 Aug 2016 | 1:47 PM ET | 03:17 The company also found that "nearly all crashes are due to the worst 20 percent of drivers," according to Matus. Now that data is making some insurance companies consider changing how they do business. "The insurance industry has been more of a blunt instrument than a surgical one," says Scott Wollney, CEO of Atlas Financial Holdings, a leading insurer of light commercial vehicles. Atlas is testing Zendrive's analytics package to see if it can improve its own predictive software, and seeing good results. "The Zendrive data is extremely valuable," Wollney said in an email. The company wants to use it "to predict the cost of loss and help prevent accidents from happening." Atlas is "confident" that Zendrive's driver-scoring methodology can help it identify high-risk drivers even before they have a crash. "When we move into a production phase with their technology, we expect to pay for its use," Wollney says. While Zendrive data is already of interest to insurance companies, it also has other applications. Before the city of San Francisco closed parts of an often-congested stretch of Mission Street to all but buses and taxis, it had Zendrive study driver behavior there. While that could turn into a market, Matus says, "it's an interesting business but not part of our revenue model right now." Instead, the company, which now has 50 employees and has raised $16 million from venture capital firms including Sherpa Ventures, First Round Capital and Thomvest Ventures, will stay focused on a single goal. "Waze is focused on getting you there the fastest," Matus says, referring to the Israeli startup acquired by Google for $1.1 billion in 2013. "We want to get you there the safest way."

Owens Published: May 13, 2017 9:20 a.m. ET Share Opinion: Google and Uber set for juicy public trial over allegations of stolen self-driving-car technology MarketWatch photo illustration/Google,Uber,iStockphoto Let’s get ready to rumble! By TheresePoletti Columnist JeremyC. Owens Technology Editor It is official: We are headed for a trial between one of the world’s biggest tech companies and the most highly valued startup in the Age of the Unicorn, with one of the most heavily hyped technological advances of the era in the middle. With a ruling issued Thursday evening, U.S. District Judge William Alsup put the legal battle between Google parent company Alphabet Inc. GOOGL, -0.08% GOOG, +0.17%  and Uber Technologies Inc. over a key technology for self-driving cars on track for a public trial, potentially starting in October. Uber had tried to argue that the case should be argued behind closed doors because of an arbitration agreement between Alphabet and the employee at the center of the battle, Anthony Levandowski, but Alsup shot that down. A public trial in this case would be the juiciest legal drama in Silicon Valley since the height of the smartphone patent war between Apple Inc. AAPL, +1.40%  and Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd. 005930, +0.70%  or Ellen Pao’s discrimination claims against venture-capital giant Kleiner Perkins. Judging by some intense early courtroom drama last week that led to Thursday’s ruling, it could be even more fun and interesting to observe than those blockbuster cases. On the surface, it seems Alphabet’s self-driving unit, Waymo, has a very good case against Uber. In February, Waymo filed a trade theft lawsuit against Uber, alleging that Levandowski, a former key manager of Google’s self driving car project, stole trade secrets and intellectual property before leaving Google. Levandowski quit Waymo in January 2016 to found Otto, a self-driving truck startup that Uber acquired just a few months later. During last week’s hearing, there were many fascinating revelations, though the crux of the case appeared to be pretty cut and dried. No one in the San Francisco federal courtroom seemed to disagree with Alsup when he said that Levandowski had probably downloaded the 14,000 documents before leaving Waymo to form Otto. Uber had already said that Levandowski was stepping aside as head of its self-driving car efforts and would no longer work on LIDAR, the key technology that is at the heart of the lawsuit. “There is a strong probability…that Levandowski purloined 14,000 documents that he should not have, and that he took those with him,” Alsup said near the end of an almost three-hour hearing on Waymo’s motion for a preliminary injunction against Uber. Alsup backed up those words Thursday evening by referring the case to the U.S. Attorney’s Office “for investigation of possible theft of trade secrets based on the evidentiary record supplied thus far.” That suggests there could be criminal charges coming for Levandowski, who has pleaded the fifth so far in preparation for that possibility. Don’t miss: Want to invest in self-driving cars? Check out the chips But Alsup also noted that Waymo is not suing Levandowski, so proving the documents were stolen is not enough. Alsup said there are two possible scenarios in the case: Levandowski stole the documents and used them at Uber, or that “Uber realized that Mr. Levandowski was radioactive and that came up in due diligence,” and the company kept him from using the LIDAR designs developed for Waymo. “We are adamant that we did not use any of their secrets,” Uber attorney Arturo Gonzales, a partner with Morrison & Foerster, said. “We went through all these terabytes and what have they found? Nothing. There is no basis here for injunction. We voluntarily took Levandowski off of LiDAR…No more LIDAR for you until this trial is over.” Alsup seemed to agree, saying Waymo has not proved that any trade secrets, if stolen by Levandowski, have ended up in use at Uber. “You have zero evidence that they copied anything,” he told Waymo’s lawyers. Alsup asked for copies of sketches of the LIDAR systems of both Waymo and Uber and seemed to question their similarities, adding that he was not certain what to make of them. He added that the best evidence would be on Levandowski’s personal laptop, which currently is not available to be searched because he evoked the fifth amendment. Read also: Why the father of the self-driving car left Google Waymo said the proof that Uber used its designs is in a batch of 3,500 documents that has been labeled privileged as attorney client communications, because Uber anticipated a lawsuit from the beginning of its discussions with Levandowski. As Alsup put it at one point, Waymo did not have a “smoking gun” but that the 3,500 documents may present a treasure trove of data for the plaintiffs. Waymo and Uber are battling that access out with a special court magistrate that is assigned to the case. Waymo’s other evidence that Uber and Levandowski worked in tandem to steal the designs is the theory that Uber and Levandowski were scheming together while the executive was still with Waymo. “Uber and Levandwoski created a coverup scheme for what they were doing, they created a coverup for what Levandowski was doing,” Charles Verhoeven, a partner with Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan and the lead attorney representing Waymo, said. “He created a coverup company, then Uber decided to buy that company.” Waymo showed an email from an Uber executive at the time planning to meet with Levandowski before he even quit Google. Another document that came from Uber in a LIDAR design notebook dated October 2015 discussed a formation of a “NewCo.” However, Uber refuted one of Waymo’s largest pieces of evidence in that theory: The fact that Uber gave Levandowski approximately 5.3 million stock options, at a value of approximately $250 million, dated Jan. 28, the day after Levandowski left Google. Uber’s lawyers said they were backdated to that date at the time of the acquisition to make Levandowski whole for the time he spent at the startup, and that Levandowski has not yet met any of the milestones required for vesting. Alphabet sought an injunction against Uber, but it had a tough time trying to prove in the hearing that Uber was actually using the 14,000 documents and files that were allegedly stolen by Levandowski. An injunction would damage Uber’s progress in building autonomous cars, which the company sees as key to the future of its ride-hailing network, and is the one question still hanging, as Alsup’s decision on that question is sealed for now as the two sides decide what parts of it should be shielded from public view. “If the court grants the injunction that Waymo is looking for, that is going to look very bad for Uber,” said Josh King, chief legal officer of Avvo, a 10-year-old online legal advice company in San Francisco. “I don’t know exactly how far that injunction would reach.” See also: Uber losses would have ranked near top among public companies in 2016 Uber can’t afford a bad look after all the black marks it has suffered of late. The ride-hailing giant, which has a private valuation of about $68 billion, is already seeking to change its image as a company that charges ahead, defying regulation amid a sexist, corporate culture that favors jerk-like behavior. With all the uncertainties and Uber’s move to sideline Levandowski, it seems unlikely that Alsup will issue a preliminary injunction and halt Uber’s work on autonomous driving, unless more incriminating evidence that it used any secrets can be found. Instead, it will be up to Waymo to dig up that evidence and present it at the coming trial. A brokered settlement between the companies could still scuttle that trial, and Uber has been known to settle lawsuits while facing several in its short history. Google, however, has shown that it will go to great legal lengths to prove a point in court. Just ask Oracle Corp.

Owens Published: May 13, 2017 9:20 a.m. ET Share Opinion: Google and Uber set for juicy public trial over allegations of stolen self-driving-car technology MarketWatch photo illustration/Google,Uber,iStockphoto Let’s get ready to rumble! By TheresePoletti Columnist JeremyC. Owens Technology Editor It is official: We are headed for a trial between one of the world’s biggest tech companies and the most highly valued startup in the Age of the Unicorn, with one of the most heavily hyped technological advances of the era in the middle. With a ruling issued Thursday evening, U.S. District Judge William Alsup put the legal battle between Google parent company Alphabet Inc. GOOGL, -0.08% GOOG, +0.17%  and Uber Technologies Inc. over a key technology for self-driving cars on track for a public trial, potentially starting in October. Uber had tried to argue that the case should be argued behind closed doors because of an arbitration agreement between Alphabet and the employee at the center of the battle, Anthony Levandowski, but Alsup shot that down. A public trial in this case would be the juiciest legal drama in Silicon Valley since the height of the smartphone patent war between Apple Inc. AAPL, +1.40%  and Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd. 005930, +0.70%  or Ellen Pao’s discrimination claims against venture-capital giant Kleiner Perkins. Judging by some intense early courtroom drama last week that led to Thursday’s ruling, it could be even more fun and interesting to observe than those blockbuster cases. On the surface, it seems Alphabet’s self-driving unit, Waymo, has a very good case against Uber. In February, Waymo filed a trade theft lawsuit against Uber, alleging that Levandowski, a former key manager of Google’s self driving car project, stole trade secrets and intellectual property before leaving Google. Levandowski quit Waymo in January 2016 to found Otto, a self-driving truck startup that Uber acquired just a few months later. During last week’s hearing, there were many fascinating revelations, though the crux of the case appeared to be pretty cut and dried. No one in the San Francisco federal courtroom seemed to disagree with Alsup when he said that Levandowski had probably downloaded the 14,000 documents before leaving Waymo to form Otto. Uber had already said that Levandowski was stepping aside as head of its self-driving car efforts and would no longer work on LIDAR, the key technology that is at the heart of the lawsuit. “There is a strong probability…that Levandowski purloined 14,000 documents that he should not have, and that he took those with him,” Alsup said near the end of an almost three-hour hearing on Waymo’s motion for a preliminary injunction against Uber. Alsup backed up those words Thursday evening by referring the case to the U.S. Attorney’s Office “for investigation of possible theft of trade secrets based on the evidentiary record supplied thus far.” That suggests there could be criminal charges coming for Levandowski, who has pleaded the fifth so far in preparation for that possibility. Don’t miss: Want to invest in self-driving cars? Check out the chips But Alsup also noted that Waymo is not suing Levandowski, so proving the documents were stolen is not enough. Alsup said there are two possible scenarios in the case: Levandowski stole the documents and used them at Uber, or that “Uber realized that Mr. Levandowski was radioactive and that came up in due diligence,” and the company kept him from using the LIDAR designs developed for Waymo. “We are adamant that we did not use any of their secrets,” Uber attorney Arturo Gonzales, a partner with Morrison & Foerster, said. “We went through all these terabytes and what have they found? Nothing. There is no basis here for injunction. We voluntarily took Levandowski off of LiDAR…No more LIDAR for you until this trial is over.” Alsup seemed to agree, saying Waymo has not proved that any trade secrets, if stolen by Levandowski, have ended up in use at Uber. “You have zero evidence that they copied anything,” he told Waymo’s lawyers. Alsup asked for copies of sketches of the LIDAR systems of both Waymo and Uber and seemed to question their similarities, adding that he was not certain what to make of them. He added that the best evidence would be on Levandowski’s personal laptop, which currently is not available to be searched because he evoked the fifth amendment. Read also: Why the father of the self-driving car left Google Waymo said the proof that Uber used its designs is in a batch of 3,500 documents that has been labeled privileged as attorney client communications, because Uber anticipated a lawsuit from the beginning of its discussions with Levandowski. As Alsup put it at one point, Waymo did not have a “smoking gun” but that the 3,500 documents may present a treasure trove of data for the plaintiffs. Waymo and Uber are battling that access out with a special court magistrate that is assigned to the case. Waymo’s other evidence that Uber and Levandowski worked in tandem to steal the designs is the theory that Uber and Levandowski were scheming together while the executive was still with Waymo. “Uber and Levandwoski created a coverup scheme for what they were doing, they created a coverup for what Levandowski was doing,” Charles Verhoeven, a partner with Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan and the lead attorney representing Waymo, said. “He created a coverup company, then Uber decided to buy that company.” Waymo showed an email from an Uber executive at the time planning to meet with Levandowski before he even quit Google. Another document that came from Uber in a LIDAR design notebook dated October 2015 discussed a formation of a “NewCo.” However, Uber refuted one of Waymo’s largest pieces of evidence in that theory: The fact that Uber gave Levandowski approximately 5.3 million stock options, at a value of approximately $250 million, dated Jan. 28, the day after Levandowski left Google. Uber’s lawyers said they were backdated to that date at the time of the acquisition to make Levandowski whole for the time he spent at the startup, and that Levandowski has not yet met any of the milestones required for vesting. Alphabet sought an injunction against Uber, but it had a tough time trying to prove in the hearing that Uber was actually using the 14,000 documents and files that were allegedly stolen by Levandowski. An injunction would damage Uber’s progress in building autonomous cars, which the company sees as key to the future of its ride-hailing network, and is the one question still hanging, as Alsup’s decision on that question is sealed for now as the two sides decide what parts of it should be shielded from public view. “If the court grants the injunction that Waymo is looking for, that is going to look very bad for Uber,” said Josh King, chief legal officer of Avvo, a 10-year-old online legal advice company in San Francisco. “I don’t know exactly how far that injunction would reach.” See also: Uber losses would have ranked near top among public companies in 2016 Uber can’t afford a bad look after all the black marks it has suffered of late.

Shown here is a smartphone that's part of the program, which lets people piece together modular components to construct a device. Google has scrapped plans to use Puerto Rico as the initial test market for its Project Ara modular-smartphone initiative, but interested developers and DIYers need not despair. The company apparently intends to continue to develop the program. The first phones coming from Project Ara, which is part of Google's Advanced Technology and Projects Group, were expected to go on sale in the Caribbean island during the third quarter as part of a pilot program. Google, however, is no longer launching the test program in the U.S. territory, spokeswoman Iska Saric said by email Friday. She declined to provide more details. A series of cryptic messages from Project Ara's Twitter account implied that changes were in store for the modular smartphone project, including a new venue for the program's first test market. Project Ara is undergoing a "market pilot re-route" with more information coming next week, said a tweet posted Thursday. Another tweet gave the impression that Project Ara would head back to Puerto Rico at some point, noting that the program wasn't saying goodbye and adding, in Spanish, that it would see the island in the future. Project Ara will let people purchase hardware modules, including processors, sensors, cameras and screens, and snap them together to create a customized smartphone. Google has said a basic smartphone frame would start at US$50. While these tweets could imply Google may nix plans for creating a do-it-yourself smartphone, a message said "Project Ara isn't going anywhere" and is just "recalculating." Google used similar language after it stopped selling Glass to consumers, saying products that fail to meet certain benchmarks but have potential are "reset." In fact, Project Ara has been "busy ... making stuff" and that's the reason why its Twitter account has been silent since late May, according to another tweet. Before Thursday, the last Twitter post from Project Ara was a photo of attendees at Google's I/O developer conference. That image was taken with a Project Ara smartphone assembled by a Google engineer during a presentation from the ATAP group. The Project Ara news comes after Google this week announced a sweeping reorganization that will create a holding company called Alphabet for its various businesses.

The future doesn’t change easily, to Larry Page’s great sadness. But for today at least, Niantic Labs is treating your personal data with kiddie gloves, and it has already achieved one of its lofty goals. Ingress itself is an absolute blast to play. View all images Two days after announcing a sweeping reorganization, Google has detailed its first departure. Niantic Labs, an augmented reality unit of Google, will be spun off into an independent company. The split, which is unusual for Google, means that Niantic Labs won't be part of Alphabet, the new holding company that is expected to be formed later this year to include Google and other parts of the company. The move was announced by Niantic Labs in a Google+ post on Wednesday, and confirmed by Winnie King, a spokeswoman for Google. She said the split would allow Niantic to accelerate its growth, "which will help them align more closely with investors and partners in the entertainment space," but didn't provide any more details. Niantic said it will allow the company to work with new partners while continuing to collaborate with Google. Google's reorganization, announced Monday, restructures the company's businesses under a holding company called Alphabet. Under the changes, many of Google's core online services -- like ads, maps and search -- will remain in the company that will be called Google Inc. Other emerging businesses and advanced projects -- like self-driving cars and Internet-connected balloons -- will become separate companies under Alphabet. The split with Niantic suggests that Google might be looking to slim itself before the upcoming reorganization. Niantic is best known for its development of "Ingress," a game for mobile devices built around players' interactions with the real world. To progress through the game, players must explore their own physical environments, which dictates the action on screen. Ingress has been downloaded more than 12 million times and has attracted more than 250,000 users, the group said in its announcement on Wednesday. Niantic also developed Field Trip, a mobile discovery app that shows users local places of interest as they pass by them. More recently, Niantic has been developing a new game called "Endgame: Proving Ground," which follows the storyline of the novel "Endgame: The Calling."

But there was still a lot that he didn't say. The move should free up time for Page and Sergey Brin to focus on Google's forward looking projects like self-driving cars, and allow other leaders, like Sundar Pichai, to take care of the core businesses. It should also provide a bit more transparency for Google's investors, allowing them to see better how those core businesses are performing. But there are questions too, about how Alphabet will evolve and which other companies might get their own CEOs. Here are four knowns and unknowns about what happened yesterday. Known: Google Inc. becomes a more focused company The restructuring leaves many familiar services in the company that will be called Google, while tossing a lot of other projects out. It will still be the home of search, ads, maps, apps, YouTube, Android, Hangouts, and Chrome -- the software and services that have been Google's primary moneymakers for years. But Google Inc. won't exclusively be made up of core services -- it will also include the Advanced Technologies and Projects group, or ATAP. That group is responsible for a few futuristic projects, like Google's Tango 3-D mapping technology for smartphones and tablets, and a project to develop smart fabric in partnership with Levi Strauss. Google inherited the group when it acquired Motorola Mobility in 2011. Google later sold Motorola, but it kept ATAP. Known: The rest of Alphabet is a sprawling incubator for other projects Moon-shot projects, along with other services outside of Google's core money makers, will comprise the rest of Alphabet. This includes Nest, which makes smart thermostats, smoke detectors and now security cameras. Here too will be the Google X research lab, the unit developing self-driving cars and Internet connected balloons, and the broadband Internet connectivity business Google Fiber. This side of Alphabet will also house Calico, a biotech company focused in the areas of health and aging. Google announced the formation of Calico in 2013. In a blog post Monday, Page said situating these far afield businesses apart from the main Internet products will allow for more management scale, to run things independently that aren't very related. Each business will have its own CEO, he said. Unknown: The ABC's of Alphabet Page said the name Alphabet was chosen because it means a collection of letters representing language, with language being the core of how Google indexes search. "G is for Google," the company said, but it didn't assign names to the other 25 letters. If each letter could become a Google businesses unit, how many letters already have associated identities? "C" could just as easily be for Calico or for Chrome. "A" could be for Android ... or ads. "B" could be for Boston Dynamics, the robotics company acquired by Google in 2013, which builds robots that mimic the movements of humans and animals, including for the U.S. military. Unknown: The timing In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Google said the new structure will be introduced in phases over the coming months. Later this year, Google will implement a holding company reorganization, known as the "Alphabet Merger," which will result in Alphabet owning all of the capital stock of Google. As part of the merger, Google will survive as a wholly owned subsidiary of Alphabet. But a more specific time frame wasn't given, so the next shoe could drop any time. Google will report its financial results under the new structure with its fourth-quarter earnings, expected in January. That would suggest that the restructuring, at least for accounting purposes, will be underway by the start of that quarter, in October. Known: More transparency is coming Under the restructuring, financial results for Google Inc. will be reported separately. Results for the other Alphabet businesses will be reported as a whole. This means that there will be a distinction made between, say, revenue generated from search ads versus revenue from the Fiber or Nest businesses. This could be a positive for Wall Street investors, who crave details about the health, or weaknesses, of Google's various units with as much specificity as possible. Unknown: Just how much transparency there will be But because revenue from the Alphabet businesses outside of Google Inc. will be reported as a whole, the information disclosed may still have plenty of gaps. It might be some time before we see financial results for, say, Nest versus Fiber. Known: The new top brass Sundar Pichai will become CEO of Google Inc. Though his title upgrade is a big one, he will still oversee many of the same products he does now. Pichai was named Google's head of product last October, which put him in charge of the company's key businesses like Android, search and Chrome. Page, currently Google's CEO, will become CEO of Alphabet and Brin will be its president. Eric Schmidt, currently executive chairman at Google, will become executive chairman at Alphabet. Unknown: Page's public profile going forward Page stepped back from managing the day-to-day responsibilities of many of Google's core products when he promoted Pichai late last year. As the official head of the most advanced and futuristic projects at Alphabet, will Page take on a more public role in running those operations?

Google is putting some of the most Google-y Android apps in the spotlight, and is sharing their source code to spur development of other apps. The site Android Experiments is showcasing Android apps that perform novel and unusual functions. A compass app, called Landmarker, for instance, puts a spin on navigational tools by letting users explore nearby landmarks by rotating their Android device around them. Another, called IOIO Plotter, is an Android tablet app that converts photos from the tablet's camera into abstract drawings using physical markers suspended from strings. There are also apps for smartwatches running Google's Android Wear software. An app called Coubertin Rings displays animated graphics on the watch face to motivate daily physical activity. It uses built-in sensors on the watch to display rings that represent the wearer's daily step count. There's also Time Mesh, a motion-based Android Wear watch face. There were just under 20 apps listed on the site on Wednesday. But Google wants developers to submit their own. The company says it's most interested in projects that explore how people interact with devices, with unique visual aesthetics. Apps should work on Android 4.4 and higher, Google said. It's fine if the apps are targeted at specific devices, like tablets or smartwatches. The apps already selected employ various programming systems, including Unity, Processing and Cinder. Google maintains a similar site for Chrome called Chrome Experiments. Zach Miners covers social networking, search and general technology news for IDG News Service.

Owens Published: May 13, 2017 9:20 a.m. ET Share Opinion: Google and Uber set for juicy public trial over allegations of stolen self-driving-car technology MarketWatch photo illustration/Google,Uber,iStockphoto Let’s get ready to rumble! By TheresePoletti Columnist JeremyC. Owens Technology Editor It is official: We are headed for a trial between one of the world’s biggest tech companies and the most highly valued startup in the Age of the Unicorn, with one of the most heavily hyped technological advances of the era in the middle. With a ruling issued Thursday evening, U.S. District Judge William Alsup put the legal battle between Google parent company Alphabet Inc. GOOGL, -0.08% GOOG, +0.17%  and Uber Technologies Inc. over a key technology for self-driving cars on track for a public trial, potentially starting in October. Uber had tried to argue that the case should be argued behind closed doors because of an arbitration agreement between Alphabet and the employee at the center of the battle, Anthony Levandowski, but Alsup shot that down. A public trial in this case would be the juiciest legal drama in Silicon Valley since the height of the smartphone patent war between Apple Inc. AAPL, +1.40%  and Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd. 005930, +0.70%  or Ellen Pao’s discrimination claims against venture-capital giant Kleiner Perkins. Judging by some intense early courtroom drama last week that led to Thursday’s ruling, it could be even more fun and interesting to observe than those blockbuster cases. On the surface, it seems Alphabet’s self-driving unit, Waymo, has a very good case against Uber. In February, Waymo filed a trade theft lawsuit against Uber, alleging that Levandowski, a former key manager of Google’s self driving car project, stole trade secrets and intellectual property before leaving Google. Levandowski quit Waymo in January 2016 to found Otto, a self-driving truck startup that Uber acquired just a few months later. During last week’s hearing, there were many fascinating revelations, though the crux of the case appeared to be pretty cut and dried. No one in the San Francisco federal courtroom seemed to disagree with Alsup when he said that Levandowski had probably downloaded the 14,000 documents before leaving Waymo to form Otto. Uber had already said that Levandowski was stepping aside as head of its self-driving car efforts and would no longer work on LIDAR, the key technology that is at the heart of the lawsuit. “There is a strong probability…that Levandowski purloined 14,000 documents that he should not have, and that he took those with him,” Alsup said near the end of an almost three-hour hearing on Waymo’s motion for a preliminary injunction against Uber. Alsup backed up those words Thursday evening by referring the case to the U.S. Attorney’s Office “for investigation of possible theft of trade secrets based on the evidentiary record supplied thus far.” That suggests there could be criminal charges coming for Levandowski, who has pleaded the fifth so far in preparation for that possibility. Don’t miss: Want to invest in self-driving cars? Check out the chips But Alsup also noted that Waymo is not suing Levandowski, so proving the documents were stolen is not enough. Alsup said there are two possible scenarios in the case: Levandowski stole the documents and used them at Uber, or that “Uber realized that Mr. Levandowski was radioactive and that came up in due diligence,” and the company kept him from using the LIDAR designs developed for Waymo. “We are adamant that we did not use any of their secrets,” Uber attorney Arturo Gonzales, a partner with Morrison & Foerster, said. “We went through all these terabytes and what have they found? Nothing. There is no basis here for injunction. We voluntarily took Levandowski off of LiDAR…No more LIDAR for you until this trial is over.” Alsup seemed to agree, saying Waymo has not proved that any trade secrets, if stolen by Levandowski, have ended up in use at Uber. “You have zero evidence that they copied anything,” he told Waymo’s lawyers. Alsup asked for copies of sketches of the LIDAR systems of both Waymo and Uber and seemed to question their similarities, adding that he was not certain what to make of them. He added that the best evidence would be on Levandowski’s personal laptop, which currently is not available to be searched because he evoked the fifth amendment. Read also: Why the father of the self-driving car left Google Waymo said the proof that Uber used its designs is in a batch of 3,500 documents that has been labeled privileged as attorney client communications, because Uber anticipated a lawsuit from the beginning of its discussions with Levandowski. As Alsup put it at one point, Waymo did not have a “smoking gun” but that the 3,500 documents may present a treasure trove of data for the plaintiffs. Waymo and Uber are battling that access out with a special court magistrate that is assigned to the case. Waymo’s other evidence that Uber and Levandowski worked in tandem to steal the designs is the theory that Uber and Levandowski were scheming together while the executive was still with Waymo. “Uber and Levandwoski created a coverup scheme for what they were doing, they created a coverup for what Levandowski was doing,” Charles Verhoeven, a partner with Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan and the lead attorney representing Waymo, said. “He created a coverup company, then Uber decided to buy that company.” Waymo showed an email from an Uber executive at the time planning to meet with Levandowski before he even quit Google. Another document that came from Uber in a LIDAR design notebook dated October 2015 discussed a formation of a “NewCo.” However, Uber refuted one of Waymo’s largest pieces of evidence in that theory: The fact that Uber gave Levandowski approximately 5.3 million stock options, at a value of approximately $250 million, dated Jan. 28, the day after Levandowski left Google. Uber’s lawyers said they were backdated to that date at the time of the acquisition to make Levandowski whole for the time he spent at the startup, and that Levandowski has not yet met any of the milestones required for vesting. Alphabet sought an injunction against Uber, but it had a tough time trying to prove in the hearing that Uber was actually using the 14,000 documents and files that were allegedly stolen by Levandowski. An injunction would damage Uber’s progress in building autonomous cars, which the company sees as key to the future of its ride-hailing network, and is the one question still hanging, as Alsup’s decision on that question is sealed for now as the two sides decide what parts of it should be shielded from public view. “If the court grants the injunction that Waymo is looking for, that is going to look very bad for Uber,” said Josh King, chief legal officer of Avvo, a 10-year-old online legal advice company in San Francisco. “I don’t know exactly how far that injunction would reach.” See also: Uber losses would have ranked near top among public companies in 2016 Uber can’t afford a bad look after all the black marks it has suffered of late. The ride-hailing giant, which has a private valuation of about $68 billion, is already seeking to change its image as a company that charges ahead, defying regulation amid a sexist, corporate culture that favors jerk-like behavior. With all the uncertainties and Uber’s move to sideline Levandowski, it seems unlikely that Alsup will issue a preliminary injunction and halt Uber’s work on autonomous driving, unless more incriminating evidence that it used any secrets can be found. Instead, it will be up to Waymo to dig up that evidence and present it at the coming trial. A brokered settlement between the companies could still scuttle that trial, and Uber has been known to settle lawsuits while facing several in its short history. Google, however, has shown that it will go to great legal lengths to prove a point in court. Just ask Oracle Corp. ORCL, -0.18%   Judging by the early salvos in this case, those of us without skin in the game should hope against a settlement and for the public trial. This blockbuster battle could be the grandest Silicon Valley legal drama of our time. Alphabet shares have gained about 20% in 2017, while the S&P 500 SPX, -0.15%  has gained about 7%.

Patrick Thibodeau (Computerworld (US)) 22 July, 2015 06:49 - - - - print email Distributors Synnex Comments There was something about Cheryl Fillekes that Google really liked. Over a seven-year period, Fillekes was contacted by Google recruiters four different times for jobs. In each case, she did well enough in the phone interviews to get an invitation for an in-person interview. Despite all these interviews, Fillekes never got a job offer, and Google is now getting an age discrimination lawsuit. Fillekes joined a lawsuit filed in April by Robert Heath, who was 60 in 2011 when he applied for a job at Google. The age discrimination complaint was amended recently to include Fillekes. The amended lawsuit also alleges that the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) received "multiple complaints of age discrimination by Google, and is currently conducting an extensive investigation." An EEOC spokesman said the agency can't, by law, discuss whether any investigation is taking place. Google was not immediately available for comment. According to the lawsuit, Fillekes started programming as a high school student in 1976. She earned a bachelor of science in engineering from Cornell University in 1982, and in 1990 earned a Ph.D. in geophysics from the University of Chicago. She was also a postdoctoral fellow at Harvard. She specializes in Unix and Linux system programming. Today, Fillekes' LinkedIn profile describes her career as a "cheese maker at Mohawk Drumlin Creamery." In 2014, "I bought a dairy farm in upstate NY. I designed and built an on-farm creamery to produce farmstead sheep's milk cheese and yogurt," she wrote. Fillekes could not be reached for comment at deadline. According to the lawsuit, a Google recruiter contacted Fillekes in 2007 for possible employment in either Google's engineering and testing group or its software development group. There were a series of phone interviews and an in-person interview at Google's headquarters in Mountain View, California. In 2010, a different Google recruiter contacted her and said that from her previous interview scores, she was an ideal candidate. This happened again in 2011 and late 2013. In each case, a Google recruiter contacted her and there were a series of phone interviews, concluding with in-person interviews, but no job offer. "Despite being very well qualified for each of the positions she interviewed for, Google did not hire her for any position after she attended her in-person interviews," the lawsuit states. The lawsuit also alleges that Google favors workers who are under the age 40 and hires them "in significantly greater numbers." In April, in response to Heath's complaint, Google said that it "believes that the facts will show that this case is without merit and we intend to defend ourselves vigorously."

Patrick Thibodeau (Computerworld (US)) 24 April, 2015 06:28 - - - - print email Distributors Synnex Comments The typical employee at Google is relatively young, according to a lawsuit brought by an older programmer who is alleging age discrimination. Robert Heath, a software engineer, was 60 when he applied in 2011 for a job at a rapidly growing Google. He wasn't hired despite having "highly-pertinent qualifications and experience," and being deemed by a Google recruiter as a "great candidate," according to Heath's lawsuit. The complaint, filed in US district court in San Jose, California, appears to make its case, in part, around some specific age data. Between 2007 and 2013, Google's workforce grew from 9500 to more than 28,000 employees, "yet as of 2013, its employees' median age was 29 years old," the lawsuit claims. That's in contrast to the median age of nearly 43 for all US workers who are computer programmers, according to the lawsuit. Heath's lawsuit seeks class-action status. In the complaint's account, Heath was contacted by a recruiter with Google's engineering staff. The company was looking for candidates with experience in C/C++ and Java. "After reviewing your experience, I thought you would be a great candidate to come work at Google and add value," wrote the Google recruiter to Heath. There was a technical telephone interview that, as described in this lawsuit, appears to have been handled oddly. The interviewer was 10 minutes late to the call, "barely fluent in English," and "used a speaker phone that did not function well." Heath politely asked him, repeatedly, to use the phone's headset but the request was declined. Consequently, Heath and the interviewer had difficulty understanding each other. One part of the interview involved writing a short program to find the answer to a problem posed by the interviewer. Heath accomplished the task and offered to share it via Google Docs or email, but, instead, the interviewer required Heath "to read the program coding over the phone." It did not go well. The interviewer "seemed not to understand" what was being read, the lawsuit states. Heath was not offered the job. Heath, who lives in Boynton Beach Fla., has a bachelor's degree in computer science, and has worked for IBM, Compaq and General Dynamics. He also has a master certification in Java, which he achieved with a certification test score "higher than 96 per cent of all previous test takers," according to the lawsuit. Prior to bringing the lawsuit, Heath filed complaints with the US Equal Opportunity Commission as well as the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing, and received right to sue notices from each. Heath's lawsuit cites a prior age discrimination lawsuit filed by a former technology manager at Google, who was called an "old fuddy duddy." That case was settled out of court. "The disproportionately low number of older workers and the history of discriminatory remarks at Google provide significant evidence of age discrimination, and we're hopeful that this lawsuit will help end discriminatory practices at Google and deter discrimination in the industry," said Daniel Low of Kotchen & Low, in a statement, which is representing Heath. In a statement, Google's response to the lawsuit was: "We believe that the facts will show that this case is without merit and we intend to defend ourselves vigorously."

Oracle made a request late last month to broaden its case against Android. Now, a supplemental complaint filed Wednesday in San Francisco district court encompasses the six new Android versions that have come out since Oracle originally filed its case back in 2010: Gingerbread, Honeycomb, Ice Cream Sandwich, Jelly Bean, Kit Kat and Lollipop. "As with previous versions of Android, these six Android releases copy thousands of lines of source code from the Java platform, as well as the structure, sequence and organization of that platform," Oracle charged. "Just as before, this copying constitutes copyright infringement." Oracle also noted that Android has expanded beyond smartphones over the years to include wearable devices, TVs, cars and various household appliances. Advertising on the mobile platform has increased dramatically as well, it said, thereby bolstering Google's core source of revenue and allowing the search giant to "reap enormous profits from both its direct and indirect exploitation of the infringing code." As a result of all this, Oracle's Java business has been seriously harmed, it said. "Given the widespread dominance Android has achieved with its continued unauthorized use of the 37 Java API packages over the past few years, Android has now irreversibly destroyed Java's fundamental value proposition as a potential mobile device operating system," Oracle wrote. Oracle seeks a declaratory judgment, an injunction, damages and an order covering its costs and attorney's fees. Google declined to comment for this story. Oracle did not respond immediately to a request for comment. In May 2012, a San Francisco jury decided that Google infringed Oracle's copyright, but it was split on the question of fair use, which permits copying under limited circumstances. The judge in the case, William Alsup, later decided that Oracle's Java programming interfaces were ineligible for copyright protection. A federal appeals court partially reversed that decision in May 2014, ruling that programming interfaces in Oracle's Java technology can be protected under U.S. copyright law. Google then appealed to the Supreme Court, which rejected the case in June.

James Henderson (ARN) 16 November, 2016 12:23 - - - - print email Distributors Arrow ECS ANZ Australasian PC Distributors (APCD) Avnet Technology Solutions Bluechip Infotech BMS Technology Dicker Data Ingram Micro Australia Leader Computers Multimedia Technology rhipe Synnex Westcon – Comstor XiT Distribution Comments Satya Nadella - CEO, Microsoft As the masses fought for front rows seats, desperate for prime viewing of Satya Nadella, a series of video reels played on the big screen. Typical of large conferences, an over the top ensemble of case studies and vendor marketing rhetoric followed, before the opening address of the day. “Hi, I’m Cortana.” Not the Microsoft CEO, rather the intelligent personal assistant kicking off the Microsoft Australia Developer Event in Sydney. And Nadella didn’t waste any time hammering home his point; “as I think of Microsoft, the source of inspiration has always been talking to developers”. On the day that Google also issued its own rallying cry to developers - through unveiling a set of enhancements to its existing suite of cloud machine learning capabilities - Microsoft hit back in equal measure. In addressing over 1,000 Australian developers, a stone’s throw away from Google headquarters in Sydney, Nadella’s message was clear; artificial intelligence, machine learning and cloud computing. “Digital technology is great, and through our products we want to truly push the envelope, but it’s really about what others do with that technology,” he said. “How do they go on to build on top of our platforms? That is core to our mission.” Read more Optus and Huawei nudge 35Gbps in 5G trial Through creating platforms for others to create technology, Nadella said there’s “no better place to start than with developers”, emphasising the vendor’s closer alignment to independent software vendors (ISVs). “It remains at the heart of who we are as a company,” he added. “Developers in Australia are now contributing to a broad spectrum across every industry and vertical.

Every developer has both the opportunity and responsibility to be able to create digital technology that creates surplus in our societies and economies.” Amidst the jam-packed crowd of checkered shirts, jeans and sneakers, Nadella proceeded to lure developers through a cloud platform built on the foundations of AI and machine learning. “Our goal as a company is to provide the tools and platforms for developers that can have a profound impact across all industries,” he explained. “The world view we have is cloud and mobile first. But we have a distinctive view of what we mean by mobility. It’s not about the mobility of any single device, it’s the mobility of the human experience across all of the computing in our lives.

The cloud is the control play that gives you that mobility across all of your computing.

Backed by the public preview of a new Azure Bot services, Redmond is attempting to enable developers to build, deploy and manage bots on the Azure cloud.

I thought this would be a pivot too far and would have damaged Microsoft the most given the rise of Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google. “I thought they’d be left out but now Microsoft is very much a central part of this new conversation.” Read more Can new players save struggling Aussie mobile phone market? Upon closing his own conversation with Australian application builders, Nadella said developers were in the “vanguard” in terms of leveraging Microsoft’s AI, machine learning and cloud computing solutions.

Is Android in the business world to stay? Why has Android's dominance taken such a long time to translate into broader uptake in the business world? Jon Gold (Network World) 02 April, 2013 11:16 - - - - print email Distributors ACA Pacific Alloys Australasian PC Distributors (APCD) Avnet Technology Solutions Bluechip Infotech BMS Technology Dicker Data Dynamic Supplies Exclusive Networks Impact Systems Technology Ingram Micro Australia Leader Computers Multimedia Technology Samsung Communications Sektor Synnex Topstar Computer International Wholesale IT XiT Distribution Comments It's official, and it's been official for a while -- Android is far and away the most popular smartphone OS in America. Ever since January 2011, when the platform surpassed RIM to take the top spot for the first time in comScore's monthly market share rankings, Google's operating system has continued to grow its user base, which accounts for 52% of the market as of this January. This growth has been created on the back of substantial software upgrades, in the form of Ice Cream Sandwich and Jelly Bean (Android 4.0 and 4.1, respectively), as well as increasingly impressive hardware from OEMs like Samsung, HTC, Sony, Motorola and LG. Last year's Samsung Galaxy S III was the first phone to dethrone the iPhone in total quarterly sales in years, according to research from Strategy Analytics, though the subsequent release of the iPhone 5 saw Apple retake the top spot quickly thereafter. [ DO'S AND DON'TS: Using Android in business ] It's easy to find a host of reasons for Android's ascendance among consumers -- a wide variety of devices offers more choice to prospective buyers, stronger hardware and bigger screens appeal to fans of the latest and greatest, and as of Android 4.0 and 4.1, the interface is arguably more impressive than the latest version of Apple iOS. What's less simple, however, is figuring out why that dominance has taken such a long time to translate into broader uptake in the business world -- the conventional wisdom is that the iPhone supplanted the BlackBerry as the enterprise smartphone of choice thanks to its own wave of popularity with the consumer, which gave rise to the bring-your-own-device phenomenon. In contrast, Android has only recently begun to become a popular option for business users, despite its ballooning overall sales numbers. So what gives? New management, new use cases For starters, the perception of security issues in the Android platform have limited its appeal to businesses and made IT departments jumpy about a large number of Android devices accessing the network. However, the past year or so has seen big changes in that state of affairs, says Morten Grauballe, an executive vice president in charge of corporate development and strategy at Red Bend Software, which provides over-the-air firmware update capability to many top Android OEMs. "Android had a disadvantage in the enterprise compared to iOS because iOS was just more secure," Grauballe says. "What's happened over the last 12 months is that the mobile device management solutions that evolved around both iOS and Android ... [have] grown in functionality when it comes to supporting the devices, so I think CIOs in enterprises are feeling more comfortable letting Android devices on their network." Along with improved manageability, Forrester analyst David Johnson says that a new crop of use cases is helping broaden Android adoption in the business world. One such new application is what he calls "Android-on-a-stick," which is designed to provide a full desktop experience for highly mobile users like college students and consultants. "Basically it's a headless Android device -- complete with quad-core CPU, but it's on a stick that has an HDMI end on it," Johnson explains. "[Users] can plug it into most any monitor or television that has an HDMI port and it works, but is powered by a USB port. Embedded Bluetooth and Wi-Fi allow it to connect to a keyboard and mouse, and gain access to a network." Moreover, the idea of dedicated-use consumer devices running Android is beginning to get more popular, he says. "There is significant interest in using low-cost, consumer-grade tablets and smartphones for a whole host of new uses, from movie ticket scanning at the theater front door, to electronic on-board recorders (EOBR) for truckers," according to Johnson. "In applications where the device needs to be fully ruggedized, Android is preferred because manufacturers can build the devices precisely to suit the need." Custom devices aside, the cost advantages of Android are substantial for this type of bespoke application, particularly in the tablet sector. To give an example: A Google Nexus 7 tablet, as of this writing, retails for $200. That buys a 7-inch, 216ppi display, 16GB of storage and 1GB of RAM. By contrast, the cheapest iPad option available, at $329, is the basic version of the iPad Mini, which has a larger but lower-resolution screen and half as much available RAM with the same amount of storage. Android popular now, but plenty of future demand for Apple A recent survey of nearly 10,000 global IT workers performed by Forrester Research offers a clear indication that Android adoption in the enterprise has grown -- along with several statistics that could mean that growth will be short-lived. According to the February Mobile Workforce Adoption Survey, Android has actually surpassed Apple as the most-used type of business smartphone, as shown below: While that's clearly an important milestone, particularly in light of the fact that nearly half of respondents said they used smartphones in the course of their duties, the study also found that one-third of those wanted an iPhone for their next work device, compared to just 22% who wanted an Android phone. Despite the aforementioned economic advantages for Android tablets, the business tablet world still appears to be Apple's. The iPad's usage share among Forrester's respondents is more than double the size of Android's. The numbers also show that Apple tablets are more desired by the IT workers surveyed, by a ratio of about 2:1. (As a side note, there's a surprisingly large amount of interest in Windows tablets, outstripping both Android and Apple.) Clearly, while Google's platform has made progress in the business world, there are major hurdles to overcome. iOS users dipping toes into Android The case of one user, who primarily uses iOS but has taken baby steps toward Android adoption, is illustrative. Banner Engineering is a Minneapolis-based manufacturer of industrial equipment like sensors, machine safety systems and wireless controllers. The company's enormous selection of available products -- more than 30,000 individual SKUs -- means that providing detailed information on each one is a challenge for sales representatives in the field. "The old story was our sales reps and distributors would travel around in their cars with trunk loads full of literature and product material," says IT Director Kellie Christensen. "If you go to a customer and they ask about a certain product application opportunity, you may or may not have that material handy." Obviously, this was far from an optimal solution, so Banner embarked on a project that brought these reams of documentation to the digital realm. The company now issues iPads to sales staff, who can use them as a reference and presentation tool. "One of our specialties is [working] with our customer to specialize products -- so we'll have a standard product ... and if they need a slight modification to that product, or even an extensive one, we work with that customer to create what we call product specials," Christensen says. With just one device manufacturer to support, iOS seemed like the logical choice. "Internally, we chose iOS because it's a lot more predictable, a lot more secure. It's really been quite easy for us to support," she says. "We're a smaller shop, we have a smaller IT group here, and [Android] would just be too much for us to support." However, Banner works with channel partners as well as its own sales staff. And not all of those partners wanted to use the iPad. Christensen says that the company used a third-party developer to translate the app over to Android. The process was pleasantly straightforward, she notes. "It actually was fairly easy to port [the app] over to Android devices. The biggest thing that we were dealing with from a design standpoint was that the screen was different ... and making sure that those buttons were still friendly to use and that everything could be seen on the screen," Christensen says. Mobility vets: Don't sweat security, fragmentation too much CompanionLink Software Marketing Director Rushang Shah says that this multi-platform environment has its own appeal to businesses, complexity issues aside. "The business audience we've always catered to is one that values options more than being tied into one system like Apple," he argues. "That is one of the major drivers of Android's growth in the business market -- business users want options." CompanionLink has made mobile device sync software since the days of Palm OS. Shah says CEO Wayland Bruns was one of about 30 people present at Palm's first developer conference, 18 years ago. While the conventional wisdom holds that the two main factors holding back Android growth are security and platform fragmentation, Bruns and Shah say they question how valid those concerns still are. According to Bruns, the issues caused by the complexity of the Android environment -- different devices, different software versions, etc. -- have been evaporating of late. The credit for this goes to Google, he says. Ever since Android versions 2.2 and 2.3 (Froyo and Gingerbread), the company has been energetically attacking fragmentation problems. "The API functions are better than ever at allowing us to add a new feature for new phones, and still be able to run the same software on older phones. Two years ago, we were bombarded by bugs and incompatibilities related to obscure phone models," Bruns says. "It has now been months since we have had such problems, even though we support the older phones as well as the newest Jelly Bean phones and tablets." As to security, Shah says, there's nothing intrinsically less secure about the Android platform than iOS. "Inherently, I don't think there's anything about the Android platform that's more risky than iOS. Yeah, Apple has this aura of 'we lock down things' but ... it's just as risky," he says. Android/Chrome? But will Android still be Android tomorrow? Rumors that Google would merge the mobile OS with its growing Chrome ecosystem started in earnest after the news in mid-March that longtime Android chief Andy Rubin would be making way for Sundar Pichai, who heads up Chrome and Google Apps. The answer, for the moment, is yes, according to Google Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt, who said that the two products would remain separate during a recent trip to India. That said, tight integration with Google's existing product infrastructure -- from Gmail to Google + to any number of other offerings -- has long been a hallmark of Android, and further blurring of the lines between Chrome and Android is far from impossible.

Linux-based platforms are gunning for iOS and Android, and Chinese companies want to price the iPhone and the Galaxy S line out of the market. Mike Elgan (Computerworld (US)) 26 January, 2013 12:11 - - - - print email Distributors ACA Pacific Alloys Arrow ECS ANZ Australasian PC Distributors (APCD) Avnet Technology Solutions Bluechip Infotech BMS Technology CertaOne Com1 International Dicker Data Dynamic Supplies Impact Systems Technology Ingram Micro Australia Leader Computers Multimedia Technology rhipe Samsung Communications Sektor Synnex Topstar Computer International Wholesale IT XiT Distribution Vendors HP Huawei Comments Just five years ago, the global epicenters of the mobile phone universe included Finland and Canada, where Nokia and Research In Motion are headquartered. After the launch of the Apple iPhone in 2007, and after Android phones started getting really good, iOS and Android devices began their sustained assault on market share, and today they dominate totally. From the perspective of who is making the majority of physical smartphone handsets, the clear leader is South Korea's Samsung, which sells more than one quarter of the world's smartphone handsets, followed by Apple, which sells about 18%. No other company gets anywhere near a two-digit market share globally. From the perspective of platforms -- who makes the operating systems and controls both the functionality and the app ecosystem that powers the world's smartphones -- it's clear that Google's Android is by far the world's leader, followed distantly by Apple's iOS. From a business perspective - who's making money on mobile phones in one way or the other - the clear winners are Apple, Google (via advertising, mostly) and Samsung. So today, we can say that the smartphone market is solidly controlled by two companies that are less than nine miles apart from each other in Silicon Valley in the U.S. (Apple and Google), plus Samsung in South Korea. These three companies in two countries ship the handsets, make the operating systems and collect most of the profits. But what will the mobile market look like five years from now? Meet the new operating systems All is not well in the universe of mobile platforms, or operating systems. Apple's iOS platform used to be much better loved by Apple fans. It had by far the most and best apps, and it was perceived by most to be innovative and leading edge. But the Android platform is either catching up to, or has already surpassed, iOS in both innovation, as well as the quantity and quality of available apps. When you combine software improvements on Android with a vastly greater variety of available handsets, many former iPhone users are defecting to the other side, or thinking about it. While users are growing ever fonder of the Android platform and its apps, hardware makers that create Android-powered phones are growing less fond. The issue is direct competition from Google itself. Google has twice launched phone initiatives where it decided to sell Google-branded phones. The first initiative was in early 2010 when Google launched the Nexus One, followed by the Nexus S. They were manufactured by HTC, but the fact that Google was involved in their design and sold them directly gave the phones a huge advantage over any phone HTC might sell -- or any phone HTC's competitors might sell. Google later came out with the Galaxy Nexus (made by Samsung) and later still the Nexus 4. Google also bought Motorola last year, both for the patents and also presumably to assert some control over the direction of Android mobile devices. The first serious assertion of that control may be the development of a device called the Google X phone, which is being developed at Motorola and which is expected to be unveiled at Google's May developer's conference, Google I/O. Nobody knows what the Google X phone (and tablet) will be like, but hints, rumors and speculation agree that it will be very different from existing Android phones. All this strong competition from Google makes handset makers wonder whether Google is friend or foe, and whether they might be better off with another software platform. These disaffected Google partners may be looking more closely at Microsoft's Windows Phone 8, now that Nokia reported some impressive numbers (both of which included the numeral 4, oddly enough): The company sold 4.4 million Lumia Windows Phone devices and reported a year-over-year quarterly U.S. market revenue increase of 444%. Although the market punished Nokia's earnings, a careful analyst might notice that Nokia's Lumia line failed horribly in the so-called "emerging markets" of China and elsewhere, but succeeded in the U.S. and Europe. The company is making more money on far fewer handsets than before. In other words, Windows Phone 8 may be helping Nokia's economic situation become less like Google's (high volume, low margin) and more like Apple's (high margin, low volume). Beyond iOS, Android and Windows Phone, there are other emerging platforms under consideration by some current Android handset makers. In fact, Google's biggest and most profitable Android partner, Samsung, is supporting a new platform called Tizen. (Intel is also a backer.) If Samsung switched from Android to Tizen, the phone platform scene would be transformed overnight. The first Tizen devices are expected within three months. Mozilla, the people who make the Firefox browser, are developing the Firefox OS for smartphones. The first Firefox phones are expected to hit next month. The people at Ubuntu Linux, the most popular client version of that operating system, are building a version for smartphones. HP's WebOS, acquired from Palm, is still a potential factor, especially since HP plans to release an open-source version called Open WebOS. Note that all of these platforms -- Tizen, Firefox OS, Ubuntu Linux and Open WebOS -- are Linux-based and all or most will be relatively open compared with Android. Meet the new handset makers While upstart platforms threaten to take advantage of weaknesses in the iOS and Android worlds, a similar thing is happening in handsets. Right now, Samsung and Apple dominate. But in China and in other markets, Chinese companies are growing faster than the global leaders. Sometime this year, we'll reach the point where half the mobile phones sold in the world will be smartphones, rather than feature phones. The reason for that shift is partly caused by a drastic reduction in pricing for smartphones, thanks to low-cost Chinese brands. And also high-end brands. In China itself, for example, Samsung is the No. 1 handset maker. But No. 2 is Lenovo, a Chinese company, and its handset business is profitable, too. According to one article, there are more than 100 Chinese companies now making smartphone handsets, and they all want to be Samsung. Rumors have been circulating that Lenovo is in talks to buy RIM -- a development that, combined with continued aggressive growth, could thrust Lenovo into Samsung territory as a global maker of phones. So if Samsung is No. 1 and Lenovo is No. 2, Apple must be No. 3, right? Wrong! No. 3 in the Chinese market is Huawei, followed by ZTE, followed by Coolpad. By unit sales, Apple is the No. 6 handset maker in China -- and its market share is shrinking. These companies, especially Huawei and ZTE, are bringing the smartphone revolution to emerging markets, for the most part. And now they want entry into the U.S. and European markets. Huawei and ZTE each had a large presence at the International CES trade show, which served as a kind of coming out party for those companies in the U.S. Samsung and Apple fans may scoff at the idea that some obscure Chinese brand like Huawei or ZTE could take market share away from the leaders. But if either or both of these companies can make phones that are 95% as good as Samsung's best phone, and cost half the price, people are going to buy them in large numbers. Apple, Google and Samsung control the global market for smartphones. But over the next year or two, all that could change as new software platforms and new handset makers take advantage of the leaders' stumbles to gobble up market share, market power and influence over the direction of mobile devices.

Google's "Project Treble" will modularize Android to make updates faster Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/05/12 12:42pm PDTMay 12, 2017 95 Plus 1 on G+ 162 Share on Facebook 76 Share on Twitter Total Shares333 Android O Android OS Development Google News Easily the most annoying aspect of using an Android phone (with the exception of Pixel/Nexus) is slow updates. Android 7.1 (which came out last year) currently sits at 0.5% marketshare, and brand new phones are still being released with 6.0 Marshmallow. Google is aiming to solve this with "Project Treble," which will modularize part of the Android OS to decrease the time OEMs spend updating their devices. If you're not familiar with how Android updates work, here's a summary. Google releases a new Android version, which silicon manufacturers (e.g. Qualcomm, Mediatek) have to supply drivers for. Once that's done, device makers (e.g. Samsung, HTC) can start re-adding all the tweaks they have made to the new Android source code. In the case of carrier-sold phones/tablets, device makers then have to wait for the carriers to approve the update. After all that is done, users finally start to receive the update. Google is hoping to speed up this process with Project Treble, which changes the architecture of Android. Essentially, a new 'Vendor interface' will contain all of the low-level software for a device - like the chipset drivers. Google will work with chipset manufacturers to make sure the Vendor interface is forwards-compatible, and the interface will be validated by a Vendor Test Suite (VTS). The aspect of this news I'm most excited about is that the Vendor interface is forwards-compatible. There have been many cases where chipset manufacturers have not updated drivers for specific popular chips, preventing devices using them from being officially updated to newer Android versions. One example is the Nexus 5 and other Snapdragon 800/801-based devices, which were never officially updated to 7.0 Nougat. It sounds like the Vendor interface will prevent this from happening, or at least prolong the end of support for a given chip. Google says that Android O will be the first version to use the new Vendor interface, and the Android O Developer Preview already has it. Hopefully we'll hear more about Project Treble at Google I/O next week. Source: Android Developers Tags Android android o project treble treble vendor interface vendor test suite vts subscribe ...

Hopefully this means Google can update more core system functions similar to Google Play Services independent of the OEM/carrier path. Mike Updates still have to go through carriers, this just helps prevent devices from early EoL and should make OEMs jobs easier by not having to rewrite every piece of code to work with new drivers. TechGuy22 that's why this is useless. carriers are still involve and OEM like samsung takes time with their own skin destinyhud thats why i buy pixel. also, like mentioned this will reduce the amount of modification needed in android's new version which means slightly early release. even if its 2 weeks early i am good wit it TechGuy22 or or you can push google to make things easier for carriers and OEMs and not bandages i have an S7 edge and a pixel xl. go figure Taco Monster You can't make things easy for someone who doesn't want to do said things. bekifft It's why I buy Pixel too but the whole point of Android was supposed to be freedom and choice. If my only real choices are Google or Apple, I might as well buy a damn iPhone. PI This Daniel Not necessarily. All the OEM has to do is bring their crap (skin) from the last android version. Of course that probably only happen with small android updates (8.1?) Zsolt V Why shouldn't they? By all accounts, they add value so it's worth the wait. CA-Sandra Fuchsia is a very long term project. It's not going to replace Android anytime soon. Dextro I've been saying for ages that Android needs an hardware abstraction in the vein of what Windows has in its driver model. Hopefully this is it and helps get those updates out faster. Sadly I expect that the endless stream of UI customization OEM make will end up killing any kind of benefit this brings. Corbin Davenport I want something like that too, but I'm not deeply familiar with the technical structure of Linux/Android, so I would assume sure there some massive limitation that is keeping that from happening. Dextro I think (but am now 100% sure on this so don't quote me) that Linux historically hasn't had any such abstraction. Drivers are meant to be inside the kernel and compiled for each specific version. That works fine if the code is open source and committed to the kernel repos but it becomes a nightmare for binary blobs. The kernel makes no allowances for stable driver APIs, they will break stuff and won't worry for anything outside of the kernel if I remember correctly. That's probably part of the reason why Android has failed to keep up with Linux kernel versions. keithzg The kernel makes no allowances for stable driver APIs, they will break stuff and won't worry for anything outside of the kernel if I remember correctly. I wouldn't really say this is true. In fact, there is a very stable API provided by the Linux kernel. Hell, one of the most famous Linus rants was about this very topic: It's a bug alright - in the kernel. How long have you been a maintainer? And you *still* haven't learnt the first rule of kernel maintenance? If a change results in user programs breaking, it's a bug in the kernel. We never EVER blame the user programs. How hard can this be to understand? WE DO NOT BREAK USERSPACE! https://lkml.org/lkml/2012/12/23/75 Obviously drivers are trickier, but they're still expected to continue working. The big catch comes in that ARM drivers tend to come as compiled binary blobs. There really isn't an allowance for that in the workflow of things for Linux; good citizens are supposed to provide source, and then new kernel versions and the drivers therefore (often within the kernel itself) are recompiled, and everyone's happy. But while the API remains the same, the ABI does not; drivers compiled as modules for an older kernel won't work on newer ones, even though the drivers would almost certainly work fine if they were recompiled. The ARM space is utterly lousy with proprietary drivers (in no small part this is Qualcomm's fault, although they're far from the only offender). Hence you have Google forever backporting kernel updates to older kernels, so that the ABI remains consistent and older device drivers continue working. Dextro Well, I stand corrected then. But one question then: I was under the impression that drivers were not in userspace but in kernelspace. That's why I didn't even think much of that famous Linus rant. keithzg True, they're (generally; FUSE, for instance, is an area of exception) in kernel space, and that rant isn't entirely applicable because of that, but for practical purposes that just means ABI changes break drivers. And the kernel devs do reserve the right to change the in-kernel API at any point, which could in theory break drivers---it's just that in practice they are rather worried about such breakage and don't wish to do so, and barely break it more than they do userspace. When you think about it, it'd kindof be an insane amount of maintenance if people had to update driver code for new kernel versions! Luckily for "desktop Linux", most drivers these days in the x86 space are open source (NVIDIA is remaining holdout, although even there you can fall back to the Nouveau drivers most of the time), so they're just baked into the kernel or provided as kernel modules, and in practice don't really have to be touched by human hands after they're originally written. Unluckily for Android, that is very much not true in the ARM hardware world. Hell, most Chinese OEMs will just flatly refuse to provide kernel source, even though they're legally obligated to do so. Gaurav Kumar Which is why fuchsia has a stable ABI...like windows. I agree it's not coming anytime soon but it may not be that far away as well.. Lawstorant in the linux world, the answer is DKMS. There's no need for kernel catch-up anymore. I bet Google is doing something similar. Сергей Бугаев Android has the HAL https://source.android.com/devices/#Hardware-Abstraction-Layer -- but it haven't been helping much, as we can see (or would it be much worse without it?). It'd be interesting to see more technical details about Tremble to understand how it's different. Andy J https://developer.android.com/things/index.html pretty much this is what they are aiming for - from the days of Project Brillo. "System updates and support: We provide the system image, updates, fixes, and more, so you can focus on creating compelling products" Brillo/Things is the same idea - there is the low level vendor stuff, the actual OS and then the OEM stuff. Google can update the OS on running devices in the field, without worrying about the vendor stuff or the OEM stuff. Knowledgeborn Allah Exactly... And, unfortunately, this probably isn't going to be anything like Microsoft's new update process for Windows 10 Mobile, which doesn't have to go through carriers. Based on all the software modifications most Android OEMs make with their devices, this probably won't speed up OS updates at all. More powerful devices may last slightly longer, but that will still leave it to the OEMs to support those devices for longer periods, and they likely won't do that anyway, since they're constantly trying to get you to purchase the next one... Zsolt V Windows 10 what? Knowledgeborn Allah Dismissing Windows 10 Mobile (and rightly so) doesn't change the fact that Android needs to learn a few things from them. Their update process, at least right now, is still miles ahead of anything Android is doing. Google should've followed the path that Microsoft already laid when it comes to updating software systems outside of the carriers. It looks like they took one thing that's beneficial but disregarded all the other necessary parts... ¯_(ツ)_/¯ Zsolt V As in how to drop 50% of the devices with the Creators update? No, thanks, Google has nothing to learn from that process. Knowledgeborn Allah Again, you're still missing the point... This isn't about dropping support for any devices with the Creators' update. This is specifically about them bypassing carriers to directly deliver updates to their consumers, which they can sustain for longer periods of time. Google has a lot to learn from that process. Zsolt V Doesn't matter. The end result is the same, the user doesn't get an update. You are missing the point, maybe you don't have one? Knowledgeborn Allah Maybe I don't have one? You sound like an idiot, bud... Maybe you have difficulty reading. I specifically stated in my original post, which you replied to, what the point was: "And, unfortunately, this probably isn't going to be anything like Microsoft's new update process for Windows 10 Mobile, which doesn't have to go through carriers." Again, the point was based on the fact that Windows 10 Mobile updates - regardless of how many people actually have Windows 10 Mobile devices, or how many devices will be discontinued due to the Creators' update - don't have to go through carriers. That's the point. Android as a platform can learn a lot from that. Before making ridiculous replies about a subject and, in effect, making yourself look dumb, maybe you should read the post you're replying to first. Just a thought. PVL_93_RU Windows 10 mobile is dead Knowledgeborn Allah https://www.onmsft.com/news/latest-windows-10-mobile-updates-bypass-carriers-update-phones-directly Say what your want about Windows 10 Mobile when it comes to development, but it's definitely not a good look when a "dead" platform can update their devices better than Android can. 🤦🏾‍♂️ Robabobbob So which windows phone OEM is actually making a modification anything close to what android OEMs do? Knowledgeborn Allah That's not the point... The point is that you can separate core Android OS functions from the themes and launchers inherent in other variations of Android provided by other OEMs. Right now, Android's update process is a disaster. Even after the OEMs push out updates to their devices, it still has to go through various carriers to actually get to consumers, showing that the carriers are actually the ones in charge. Windows 10 doesn't have that problem. iOS doesn't have that problem. Android has that problem. bekifft I agree completely about the HAL, but the real problem remains the network operators retaining strict control over user devices. If AT&T doesn't want to spend the money to add AT&T Navigator, AT&T Device Locator, AT&T Messages, etc etc etc, they will simply not deploy the update. SomeGuy112 This is great, gives the potential for much longer OS update support, especially for Googles own hardware. Hopefully the OG Pixel gets longer than 2 year OS support because of this. destinyhud good point Dn Bro Didn't the article say the new devices with O will have this? DragoCubed The dev preview for the pixel has this project. We can assume it's staying with the pixel MrHanMan So, is it Trebble, or Treble? Jdban Treble according to the google docs Corbin Davenport It is Treble, I can't spell. Fixed. Jeff The trouble with Trebbles... destinyhud i really hope this fixes the 2 week delay in getting major update to nexus devices /s John Doe This is good but Google need to do more. They need to modularize everything in the Android update process. Create a separate carrier update so the baseband can be updated separate from the OS and same to drivers and also OEM skins/Apps. This should have FIVE different updates paths: 1) Core OS/Kernel update path 2) Driver update path 3) Baseband/Carrier related Apps update path 4) OEM Skin/Apps path 5) Security update path This way Google can control the Security, Core OS, Baseband, and Drivers by working with carriers and silicon manufacturers. Also if T-Mobile for example wants to push an update out for the baseband and messaging/phone apps they can do that independent of Google and OEMs. The same goes for Samsung and Qualcomm and others. Latheryin You are confused on one part. What you call skins are not what you think they are. All of the OEM versions of android are completely different distros that replace core OS files and frameworks with their versions. John Doe I know but If Google were to modularize it then it would just be a "skin" or "theme" that is separate from the framework/OS this will give Google control over the main OS and the only way to do that is to not allow OEMs to modify it too much. Latheryin Which would remove all the extra features that devices add on. Many have to be tied into the frameworks and other base OS drivers and libs. There is no separation in it really. And with the way they licensed Android they cant really control a whole lot. Any OEM could easily reverse anything Google does and still release it. John Doe Well yeah of course Google can't do that alone they would have to make new agreements with OEMs and carriers. Most OS skins do not have that many extra features and Google can create APIs to allow OEMs to modify anything they want like if Samsung wants to add an Iris scanner as a password or whatever. The point is OEM "skins" need to become more like launchers in the play store like Nova and Apex and If OEMs want to modify something they would have to ask Google like how Microsoft treats windows. Latheryin You really dont have a great understanding of how things work. That will never hap=p=en. Maybe with Googles second mobile OS they might try to have more control. John Doe How about instead of being an arrogant prick, you tell me what I said is incorrect or what Google cannot do? Why do you think this cannot happen? Microsoft did this with Windows mobile. Like I said, Google would have to sign new licensing agreements with OEMs and Carriers but they probably have to revise it for this Project Treble anyways. Google already uses its Apps and Play store as a bargaining chip to update those agreements. Latheryin Ok first. Google would have to change the license under which android is licensed. Which can't be done. Also have you ever ripped Android apart and had a look? I would guess not as if you had we would not be talking about this. As for what we does does. That really is apples and oranges. Not even close e same thing. The apps and play store are not really that big of a deal. There are hundreds of android devices released every year that don't include them and they sell really well. John Doe You said NOTHING I have not said already. Why Google cannot change the Android license? What stops Google from implementing this since you are the Genius that ripped Android apart and decided this cannot be done? Google already has MADAs in place and they update them every few years with OEMs. Those devices are mostly in China since Google services are banned there. If the Play store is not a big deal then Samsung would have forked Android a long time ago. But go ahead I am still waiting for your "intelligent" replies. Even Amazon's fire phone failed miserably without the play store and Google apps. Latheryin Have you even read the license? Do you really have any idea what happens when something is licensed? Doesn't take that much really. Anyone can look at the code. Heck some of the best android developers are teens. Samsung already did. It's called tizen. Also Samsung is not the end all of devices. They even have a separate store for the devices they run with Android. All Samsung apps don't even hit the Play store. They are Android devices for the common man. Made for everyday people. Ask your favorite developer what device he runs. Look if you want to know more why not dig in, instead of trying to get into a tech conversation when you don't really know too much about it. John Doe Licenses can be updated and their MADAs can be updated which they already do. Samsung did not fork Android, they created a different OS. And that is not turning out very well for them. You still have not told me how what I said cannot be implemented. You should go get one of those Teen Android developers to help you out before you just turn down ideas that you have know nothing about. If Google wanted to they can change Android to how Windows does updates there is nothing stopping them from doing that and OEMs will not fork Android if they did that. I love how you just criticize arguments without providing valid reasons instead of just saying Android does not allow you to do that provide factual reasons or STFU. klaus666 Could this also help to port LineageOS to a smartphone once LineageOS is adapted to this new modular system? jgarrido I dunno, sounds like treble to me... JD OK I get that Google is essentially making what in the Windows World is the HAL and breaking that out of the Kernel and they're essentially creating a lower level API (For lack of a better term) to segment off Android from the OEM mods. However what is actually stopping the OEMs from sayin' fuck this ain't working out let me go in there and refork it anyway. I mean API's are there, now and OEMs should be using that to interact with Android but Android is coming up short so they fork it and custom build the ROM with their own customization and branches. For the longest time the camera stack was a HUGE reason for doing this, even now the Camera2 API is still coming up short, which is why Samsung Completely branches on their own for that too. freshprince_87 Google simply needs to make it mandatory for carriers /OEMS to update their devices and release new phones in the most current version of Android Adnoxaei They could make it a requirement for access to the Play store. Without this interface, that would have been very restrictive. With this interface, customizations can still easily exist, so companies may be more willing to cooperate...espevially if it cuts down on the time needed to test and deploy updates boop By the sound of it, the Vendor Interface is for SoC manufacturers, not device makers. jcopernicus Sweet! Can't wait for my Z3 Compact to get this update! NubCake This doesn't sound like a treble idea at all, hopefully it helps the slow updating process. Knowledgeborn Allah I see what you did there... 🙄😂 ddevito No bass.... Tom Westrick But what if a user is all about that bass? Killa Then they might be in treble if that's all they are about. Sorry, couldn't help myself. :P Emergency Medical Hologram Bassed on what? Martheen Cahya Paulo There's plenty of tweeter surrounding it. Dolby so if we consider the stereo type. Testraindrop While this is certainly a step in the right direction, I somehow doubt that this will change Googles attitude to abandon their own devices after 2 years. Its not like the SOC in the Nexus 5 stopped working when N was installed, in fact its working fine, developed by independent individuals without having "to work with chipset manufacturers", which Google apparently couldn't even achieve. Also the times where google stops updates for the N6 and the Pixels is already set, so even with a chipset blob that is "forwards-compatible" there wont be any further (official) updates. Also if those Vendor APIs will have limits to certain OS aspects like camera, sound etc., then manufacturers will not use them and will just fork again the OS as done currently. saf1927 The custom ROMs that work on Nexus 5 devices don't actually benefit from a lot of things that an officially supported device would. Qualcomm has completely abandoned the chip so from a retail perspective, it's not suitable anymore. Even the "security updates" that these ROMs show in "About phone" aren't actually all implemented, since none of the proprietary blobs and binaries could be updated. Just because a device can be updated with a custom ROM, doesn't mean it's actually running it well. someone755 "Just because it's running it well doesn't mean it's running it well." Welp. saf1927 Wait, what? I can't find that sentence anywhere and I don't remember editing the comment. AbdulB1 Mediatek and in some cases​ Qualcomm (for Nexus 5,sd800,801) don't want people to stay on old phones they try to force them to buy new phones for latest Android version. I am not sure will they be happy about this change? I suspect they will flood market with phones running Android nougat instead. They will try to resist this change by Google. saf1927 Mediatek and Qualcomm aren't device makers, they are silicon manufacturers. AbdulB1 Mediatek charges device makers for new drivers for latest Android versions. Qualcomm stopped supporting sd 800/801 for Android Nougat and thus even sony a device maker who was developing Android N developer versions for a SD800/801 stopped. Chipset makers also have huge clout , it not just sensor makers who decide to support or not their older hardware for newer Android release. saf1927 Well, my point is that none of the silicon manufacturers will force anyone to make only Nougat phones, like you claimed. AbdulB1 "Google will work with chipset manufacturers to make sure the Vendor interface is forwards-compatible, and the interface will be validated by a Vendor Test Suite (VTS)." so if Vendor dont get validated for VTS then do you expect any chances of Android O for those devices? dizel123 I suspect if OEMs want to release new phones with the latest OS version because that's what their users want(I know I'm making assumptions) and Mediatek and Qualcomm try to force them to release phones with Nougat, then Intel will suddenly become a dominant player in the mobile market. This would be exactly the kind of "in" they're praying for. AbdulB1 Intel architecture is quite old , I owned 2 Intel based Android tablets. Intel even didn't bothered to upgrade the OS from 4.0.4 and other one had 5.0 as latest release even it though it was buggy as hell and every hardware vendor went for 5.1 instead. Intel had an edge of running windows along android on their cpu tech. But lack of proper built in modem destroyed their chances in Android world. Their SOCs still had quite high consumption even after releasing newer and newer generations of Mobile SOCs. dizel123 I don't have any inside information, but I'm guessing Intel is working on fixing their problems and making high quality SOCs Cakefish Intel dropped out of the mobile SOC wars. It cancelled development of all upcoming chips last year, I believe. dizel123 Their announcement at this year's Mobile World Congress as well as their current road map on their website both indicate that they're still developing mobile SOCs Cakefish So has it changed since this? -> http://www.anandtech.com/show/10288/intel-broxton-sofia-smartphone-socs-cancelled dizel123 Read my last comment again Lateef Alabi-Oki Jesus! What took them so long? pfmiller I believe there are performance costs to adding hardware abstraction. Google may feel that mobile hardware is finally at a point where it's worth the cost. Justin Martin This was my question. What is it going to do to performance. Not that I'm a Samsung user, but how much will touch wiz suck now? AbdulB1 Will it help in churning out custom ROMs? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I actually want the vendors to work on Android itself, not just their layer. They fix a lot of the bugs that Google leaves in. saf1927 They are already working on that: "In addition to the architectural changes, we're working with our silicon and device partners to take their code changes, such as features for a carrier network in a specific country, and move them into the common Android Open Source Project (AOSP) codebase. For example, Sony and Qualcomm contributed dozens of features and hundreds of bugfixes to Android O so they no longer need to rework these patches with each new release of Android." Simply put, some vendors contribute more than others. Sony is a great example in that regard. They contribute a lot. dizel123 This might just be the best thing Google has ever done to Android Eddie Ringle If you want to see more technical details, here's a bit of what I found back in March when the Developer Preview was released: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13928385 SHunter Orrrrr.... https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/7b191be55920725d6f6aba09c97c1e1942bdfb290cb4cf53e2cb9e23c706626c.png Eumelanin Knight Better late than never. Let's hope Carriers and Manufactures don't have their way and muck this up some how. bekifft At least they're being up front about the problem finally and making it an official "project." It seems like every year the promise is "we're fixing battery this time" and "we're fixing updates." Every year. Never gets better. And with the current FCC and the network operators only set to get worse about their abusive practices, I don't hold out much hope for this plan. What it boils down to is if there is any possible way for network operators (carriers) to meddle with the update, they will. This practice truly aught to be illegal, but see above. Maybe this will at least help lazy to the point of negligence OEMs (Lenovo) not be so appallingly slow. Islam sounds like a joke to me. John C.S. Lock When you finally giving up on Android after 10 long years , here we come iOS ! charfarstar I'll believe when Pixel 2 comes with 4 years of OS updates. MeCampbell30 Turn the treble up in my headphones. Régis Knechtel OMG! I can't believe they're finally doing something about it! https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/5acada086a36a588b7289e5b2a26d7c5f205e0b15a6c77c9b631f1a387dc8d2a.gif Cypher Hey guys and gals, let's add more abstraction to make this slug of an OS even slower! But hey, at least you'll get more frequent updates so that it can get slower more often! xyz People have been telling Google to use their muscle with the chipset makers forever. Qualcomm didn't release drivers is not an acceptable reason to not update Android. Sir_Brizz Hardware manufacturer doesn't release drivers is a perfectly acceptable reason not to update. Consumers should level their hatred at the right target. Blaming Samsung, for example, for Qualcomm's shortcoming won't change Qualcomm's policies. Andy J So last year it was A/B updates from Project Brillo and this year it's the ability to update the OS independently from the low level chipset drivers and the OEM stuff - which is also something Google developed for Project Brillo. While there are no actual Project Brillo / Android Things products in the market yet - it was definitely a worthwhile project for them with these rewards. (Yes I'm aware Chromebooks had A/B updates - but from everything I have heard, they still came about because of Project Brillo, even if Project Brillo wasn't an actual thing when they found their way to Chromebooks) kelpa32 it take google untill android O to try to get updates on time. Urmil Shroff Am I dreaming? Is this really going to happen? PI -This things don't work as u r expecting it ., Google can make guidelines but cant force OEMs to follow it . Oem will still not pass this ,, they will rant about high testing methods and quality benchmarks , ultimately they will pass it for devices only which they want (flagships) only ,, PVL_93_RU This is huge for Android in general. Of course the ideal way of doing things is following ChromeOS model where Google is entirely in charge of managing and updating the software, but then we'd lose out on what makes android unique, which is OEM skins Still though, modular updates are hopefully the next step that will really accelerate how fast devices receive OS updates. Especially mid-range and budget models Patel Nisha I swear I see something like this for every release but yet never happens Paul It's all fine and dandy but I suspect most phone companies still wont upgrade them because they want us to upgrade to newer phones so keeping older phones on older firmwares is in their interest so I don't think much will change. In any event, I'm happy that Google is doing this because it's one less excuse phone companies have to not upgrade their phones, but personally, I think Android could do with something like what Windows does with upgrades so almost any hardware can upgrade to the latest Androids without the manufaturas getting in the way. TonGi018 This is really exciting news! Android Developer Will this also lead to more updates, over a longer period of time ? boop Potentially, as it eliminates the forced EoL when the SoC manufacturer drops support, but it's still up to OEM and Carriers to develop and distribute updated. Android Developer Maybe for Google Pixel , at least? Maybe more than 2 years of updates?

Dan Rosenbaum (Computerworld (US)) 28 October, 2015 14:30 - - - - print email Distributors ACA Pacific Alloys Australasian PC Distributors (APCD) Avnet Technology Solutions BMS Technology Dicker Data Dynamic Supplies Impact Systems Technology Ingram Micro Australia Leader Computers Multimedia Technology Samsung Communications Sektor Synnex Topstar Computer International Wholesale IT XiT Distribution Comments The guy in the T-Mobile store turned the phone over in his hands a few times. "This is a nice phone," he said. "But isn't this the HTC One A9? How'd you get this already? It's not out 'til next week." I explained that I was reviewing it for Computerworld, but my SIM card had expired and I needed a new one. "This is sweet," he said, referring to the phone, not the assignment. "I'd have thought it was an iPhone, except I saw it's got Android. And look," he continued, unable to resist poking and swiping at the screen. "They even took most of that Sense bloat stuff" (well, being in Brooklyn, he didn't say 'stuff') "off. This is really nice." Mojo is a tough thing to master. HTC once had mojo, maybe four or five years ago. Its phones were heavier and bulkier than most, but the tradeoff was in terrific screens and better-than-average sound. Android, and the phones it ran on, was fresh and unrefined, and everyone was trying to put their own spin on it. HTC had it going on. [ Further reading: Mobile apps that deliver hefty ROI ] Until suddenly it didn't. Samsung entered the market, as did Motorola with its great Droid line. Better screens became more common and the iPhone took over the world. HTC phones were comparatively fat, slow and ugly, and the company dropped further and further down the list of number of products sold (for example, it didn't appear at all in Gartner's list of worldwide mobile phone sales for the second quarter of 2015). With the One A9, though, HTC may have gotten its mojo back. Put an A9 and an iPhone 6S face down on a desk next to each other, and if you were in a hurry you could easily be forgiven for grabbing the wrong one. This degree of physical mimicry is pretty nervy, and if a company is going to try it, it had better get it right. HTC does. Which is not to say that the One A9 is simply an iPhone clone, or that the company is relying on the physical resemblance to the world's most profitable phone. This is a nice piece of gear in its own right. Start with Android. The One A9 has the distinguishing feature of being the first non-Google phone to ship with Android 6.0 -- the "Marshmallow" release. This isn't the place for an Android 6.0 review, but the One A9 benefits from Google's increasing focus on UI. More than that, though, HTC has stripped out nearly all the Sense interface elements and bloatware that had been bugging buyers. Remember that flip-card digital clock that used to be HTC's signature? Gone (although you can get it back if you're feeling nostalgic). Keep in mind, though, that I reviewed the unlocked version of the phone. If the version you get from AT&T, T-Mobile or Sprint is all loaded down with stuff you can't get rid of, complain to your carrier; HTC's native version is pretty sparkling clean. (You'll note that Verizon was not on that list; as of this writing, the A9 isn't expected from Verizon until December.) That said, I don't know why anyone would buy a locked version of this phone. HTC is currently selling an unlocked 32GB version of the phone direct to consumers for $399. (Pricing from carriers wasn't available pre-release.) AT&T's price for the predecessor M9 was $200 with a two-year contract and more than $700 free and clear. An unlocked iPhone 6S runs $649 for the 16GB version. And a 32GB Nexus 5X, which also runs Marshmallow and is roughly equivalent in specification, will cost you $429. In other words, $399 for an A9 is a pretty solid value. Better act fast, though. As of November 7th, HTC is raising the price to $499. At $399, this is a solid value. At $499, it's more in line with other phones in its class. The One A9 vs. the iPhone 6S So how similar does the A9 look to the iPhone 6S? Very. The A9 is darker than the Space Gray iPhone, more graphite than gray, but they share a brushed aluminum finish and rounded edges at the backs and corner. They also share antenna bands on the back. The A9 is 5.75 in. long, 2.75 in. wide, and 0.3 in. thick; that's 0.3 in. longer and 0.1 in. wider than an iPhone 6S. At 5.0 oz., the weight is identical. The A9's main camera, flash and secondary mic are in the middle of the back, unlike the iPhone, which has them in the upper left corner. On the front, the glass of both phones goes all the way to the edges. The A9's earpiece slit is longer than the iPhone's, the fingerprint sensor is oblong instead of round, and the screen is 5 in. diagonal, rather than the iPhone's 4.7 in. HTC put the volume rockers on the right side of the phone with the power switch, and textured the power switch so you can find it easily. The drawers for the micro-SIM and a microSD card are along the left edge. The A9 charges through a micro-USB socket; no USB-C here. Where HTC is unchanged is in its attention to multimedia. It was among the first to adopt AMOLED screens, and one of the reasons its phones were so bulky was because the company built in acoustic spaces for its speakers. The A9's AMOLED screen -- as sharp as one expects from HTC -- is full high-def (1080p) with an "optimized" color space, though you can dial the saturation back to sRGB if you are so moved. And although the company swapped acoustics for svelte-ness -- sound now fires through a single speaker along the bottom edge -- audio quality is not ignored. The A9 can handle pretty much any sound format file you can throw at it, up to and including .OGG, .MID and FLAC files. When you use headphones, there's a "BoomSound" setting with Dolby Audio that you'll want to leave enabled; it produces a nice roundness and bass emphasis that doesn't overpower the music. It helps music that's stored on the phone, as well as streamed music from Spotify and the higher-quality Deezer. (However, the built-in speaker is nothing to write home about.) Photographers will like the A9, too. The 13-megapixel main camera can record at 1080p, and can store in either JPEG or RAW format. There are easily accessible "pro" controls that let you play with white balance, exposure level, ISO, shutter speed and macro magnification. The expected panorama, slo-mo and hyperlapse modes are there and simple to use; so is a selfie mode with controls that include "autoselfie" and "voice selfie." Say "cheese" or "capture," and the deed is done. The fingerprint scanner can hold up to five prints; it seems accurate and is quick to respond. I vastly prefer it over PINs (although there is a backup PIN required in case something goes south with the scanner) and especially the awful facial recognition in earlier Android versions. The battery is a comparatively small at 2150mAh, but it supports Qualcomm's Quick Charge standard (version 2.0 for now; 3.0 will come with a future software update). Claimed 3G talk time is up to 16 hours; claimed HD video playback time is up to 12 hours; claimed standby time is 18 days. I didn't have time to test those, but experience has shown a mountain of salt is appropriate for manufacturer battery claims. I got about two days of life during my tests, which were not focused on power savings. If you want to know if you can get through a full day on a single charge, the answer is: No worries. Of course, the phone is also a phone, and a good one. It supports Wi-Fi Calling, which lets you route calls over known Wi-Fi networks rather than the cellular network. Of course, the quality of the call will vary depending on the quality of your Wi-Fi network, and it's a good bet that whoever provides your Wi-Fi doesn't pay as much attention to its network as a cell carrier does. My anecdotal tests indicated that Wi-Fi calls don't sound as good as calls on the cell network, but my tests were anything but rigorous or controlled. That said, there are large swaths of the world where cellular minutes and data are precious and Wi-Fi isn't; for those people, Wi-Fi Calling would be an important feature. Bottom line If you're suffering from iPhone envy but are tied to the Android world (and want to save $150 besides), the HTC One A9 is your ride. But even if you couldn't care less about Apple, you'll still want to lay hands on this phone, which has put HTC back in the first rank of Android devices. At a Glance HTC One A9 HTC Price: $399 unlocked before November 7th; $499 unlocked after November 7th; prices at AT&T, T-Mobile, Sprint and Verizon will vary Pros: Essentially an Android iPhone; comes with Android 6.0 Marshmallow; largely (but not totally) free of vendor clutter; excellent audio via headphones; fine camera with good controls; long battery life; for a short time, a comparatively low price Cons: Phone speakers are just adequate; not a completely pure version of Android; price goes up $100 after November 7th Arrow APEX Puts Partners in F1 Pole Position More from Arrow ECS Follow Us Twitter LinkedIn Join the ARN newsletter!

But nerds like us searched for gadgets, gadgets, and more gadgets. Susie Ochs (Macworld.com) 16 December, 2015 22:34 - - - - print email Distributors ACA Pacific Alloys Australasian PC Distributors (APCD) Avnet Technology Solutions Bluechip Infotech BMS Technology CertaOne Dicker Data Dynamic Supplies Impact Systems Technology Ingram Micro Australia Leader Computers Multimedia Technology Samsung Communications Synnex Topstar Computer International Wholesale IT XiT Distribution Vendors Huawei Comments If the eyes are the windows to the soul, the things we search Google for day in and day out might be the windows to our brains—or at least what most captured our minds, as a global society, during the past year. Google on Wednesday released its lists of the biggest trending topics of 2015, namely the ones that got the biggest spike this year versus 2014. The lists are presented interactively, letting you refine the search by country, drill down by topic, and even flash back to earlier years to see how our online obsessions have changed over time. Globally, the top 10 biggest trending topics include a mix of entertainment and breaking news, sometimes both, as in the case of the No. 1 search, “Lamar Odom.” The retired NBA star and estranged husband of Khloe Kardashian fell into a coma in October of this year, which means searches for him must have spiked a lot to take the crown for all of 2015. The top 10 is rounded out by Charlie Hebdo, Agar.io (a hit browser game that was ported to iOS and Android), Jurassic World, Paris, Furious 7, Fallout 4, Ronda Rousey, Caitlyn Jenner, and American Sniper. More interesting to nerds like us is probably the list of consumer tech trending topics, a distilled look at the hardware we were most fascinated by in 2015. That includes: 10. Surface Pro 4 Rob Schultz PCWorld’s Mark Hachman loves his Surface Pro 4, explaining in his review, “The combination of an Intel Skylake chip, a new Type Cover keyboard, and faster SSD speed help push the Surface Pro 4 into a higher echelon of performance.” The only tablets that made this list are aimed at people who want to get serious work done, an interesting trend in itself. 9. Nexus 6P Adam Patrick Murray For the pure Android experience, you can’t beat a Nexus phone, and the Huawei-made Nexus 6P turned plenty of heads this year. In her review, Greenbot’s Florence Ion called it not just “the best Nexus ever” but “the best premium Android phone on the market.” 8. HTC One M9 Greenbot’s Florence Ion had mixed feelings about the latest flagship phone from HTC, calling it “a disappointingly good phone,” for not iterating enough compared to last year. Kind of makes you want to Google it to find out more, doesn’t it? 7. Samsung Galaxy J5 Samsung This phone is only available in India, which means we don’t have any hands-on experience with it, but it generated tons of interest in that part of the world. The Galaxy J5’s big selling points are data compression and restrictions on background data, to save customers both data and battery life. 6. Samsung Galaxy Note 5 Florence Ion The world likes big phones, and our Google searches cannot lie. In her Greenbot review, Florence Ion says that Samsung’s killer phablet is “so good at everything it does, it outshines the rest of the Galaxy family.” Yes, even the No. 2 gadget on this very list… 5. LG G4 Rob Schultz Jon Phillips found a lot to like about the LG G4 in his Greenbot review, praising it for old-school features like a removable battery and expandable microSD storage. Florence Ion even crowned it the winner of a camera shootout with the Galaxy S6. 4. iPad Pro Apple Apple’s tablet went big this year, with a 12.9-inch model aimed at power users who want to run two full-sized apps side-by-side, or take advantage of the pressure-sensitive Apple Pencil drawing tool. Writing for Macworld, Susie Ochs says it makes “a rightful claim on the name Pro,” but may not be worth the premium price for more casual iPad users. 3. Apple Watch Susie Ochs The only smartwatch to crack the top 10 trending topics, the Apple Watch had a slow rollout beginning in April (we wonder how many searches were driven by its only-available-online exclusivity), but quickly clawed its way to the top of the nascent smartwatch market. In Macworld’s review, Susie Ochs called it “a lovely piece of hardware” even while being frustrated by its version–1 shortcomings. 2. Samsung Galaxy S6 Florence Ion Samsung’s flagship phone debuted this spring, bringing major improvements over the previous version. Greenbot’s Florence Ion says in her review, “The Galaxy S6 is evidence that the company has finally figured out that premium phones should look and feel premium. It’s fast, powerful, battery efficient, and quite frankly it’s one of the best Android devices I’ve ever used.” 1. iPhone 6s Jason Snell The world’s biggest trending tech topic is—obviously—the world’s most popular single phone. Apple moved record numbers of its iPhone 6s this year, thanks in large part to the device’s runaway popularity in China. In the Macworld review, Jason Snell fought back at claims that Apple’s “S year” phones don’t innovate enough, saying, “The iPhone 6s and 6s Plus offer some major improvements, with better cameras (front and back), much faster processors, more responsive Touch ID, and the single biggest improvement to the iPhone’s user interface in its history. But other than that, y’know, no big deal.” How IoT Is Leading A Revolution In Home Networking More from Leader Computers Follow Us Twitter LinkedIn Join the ARN newsletter!

The IBM/Google Cloud Computing Initiative provides a virtual IT lab that lets students "learn how to develop systems and write massively parallel applications that take full advantage of the distributed computing paradigm," according to IBM. The NSF awarded grants to Carnegie-Mellon University, Florida International University, MIT, Purdue, University of California-Irvine, UC-San Diego, UC-Santa Barbara, University of Maryland, University of Massachusetts, University of Virginia, University of Washington, University of Wisconsin, University of Utah and Yale. "Academic researchers have expressed a need for access to massively scaled computing infrastructures that allow them to complete projects and research activities that have been difficult or impossible previously due to the amount of data involved," the NSF's Jeannette Wing, assistant director for computer and information science and engineering, says in an IBM press release. The 14 universities have a variety of projects they will run on the IBM/Google cloud. Examples include Carnegie-Mellon projects to improve Web searching and to develop machine translation technology. MIT, Wisconsin and Yale are performing a comparative study of approaches to cluster-based, large-scale data analysis. The University of Washington is using the IBM/Google platform to develop new algorithms for analyzing astronomical images. Key components of the IBM/Google cloud platform include a cluster of processors running the MapReduce programming model and the Google File System; IBM-designed open source software that helps students develop programs for clusters powered by Apache's Hadoop; and IBM Tivoli tools for management, monitoring and dynamic resource provisioning.

U.S. Editions Australia Edition China Edition India Edition Italy Edition Japan Edition Singapore Edition United Kingdom United States May 14, 2:39 AM EDT Subscribe Search Search Business Technology World National Media & Culture Millennial Money Entertainment Sports Subscribe Technology The Future Of Robots, Artificial Intelligence And Computer Science By Arend Hintze On 05/13/17 AT 8:00 AM Close Way back in the 1980s, a schoolteacher challenged me to write a computer program that played tic-tac-toe. I failed miserably. But just a couple of weeks ago, I explained to one of my computer science graduate students how to solve tic-tac-toe using the so-called “Minimax algorithm,” and it took us about an hour to write a program to do it. Certainly my coding skills have improved over the years, but computer science has come a long way too. What seemed impossible just a couple of decades ago is startlingly easy today. In 1997, people were stunned when a chess-playing IBM computer named Deep Blue beat international grandmaster Garry Kasparov in a six-game match. In 2015, Google revealed that its DeepMind system had mastered several 1980s-era video games, including teaching itself a crucial winning strategy in “Breakout.” In 2016, Google’s AlphaGo system beat a top-ranked Go player in a five-game tournament. The quest for technological systems that can beat humans at games continues. In late May, AlphaGo will take on Ke Jie, the best player in the world, among other opponents at the Future of Go Summit in Wuzhen, China. With increasing computing power, and improved engineering, computers can beat humans even at games we thought relied on human intuition, wit, deception or bluffing – like poker. I recently saw a video in which volleyball players practice their serves and spikes against robot-controlled rubber arms trying to block the shots. One lesson is clear: When machines play to win, human effort is futile. This can be great: We want a perfect AI to drive our cars, and a tireless system looking for signs of cancer in X-rays. But when it comes to play, we don’t want to lose. Fortunately, AI can make games more fun, and perhaps even endlessly enjoyable. Designing games that never get old Today’s game designers – who write releases that earn more than a blockbuster movie – see a problem: Creating an unbeatable artificial intelligence system is pointless. Nobody wants to play a game they have no chance of winning. But people do want to play games that are immersive, complex and surprising. Even today’s best games become stale after a person plays for a while. The ideal game will engage players by adapting and reacting in ways that keep the game interesting, maybe forever. So when we’re designing artificial intelligence systems, we should look not to the triumphant Deep Blues and AlphaGos of the world, but rather to the overwhelming success of massively multiplayer online games like “World of Warcraft.” These sorts of games are graphically well-designed, but their key attraction is interaction. It seems as if most people are not drawn to extremely difficult logical puzzles like chess and Go, but rather to meaningful connections and communities. The real challenge with these massively multi-player online games is not whether they can be beaten by intelligence (human or artificial), but rather how to keep the experience of playing them fresh and new every time. Change by design At present, game environments allow people lots of possible interactions with other players. The roles in a dungeon raiding party are well-defined: Fighters take the damage, healers help them recover from their injuries and the fragile wizards cast spells from afar. Or think of “Portal 2,” a game focused entirely on collaborating robots puzzling their way through a maze of cognitive tests. Exploring these worlds together allows you to form common memories with your friends. But any changes to these environments or the underlying plots have to be made by human designers and developers. In the real world, changes happen naturally, without supervision, design or manual intervention. Players learn, and living things adapt. Some organisms even co-evolve, reacting to each other’s developments. (A similar phenomenon happens in a weapons technology arms race.) Computer games today lack that level of sophistication. And for that reason, I don’t believe developing an artificial intelligence that can play modern games will meaningfully advance AI research. We crave evolution A game worth playing is a game that is unpredictable because it adapts, a game that is ever novel because novelty is created by playing the game. Future games need to evolve. Their characters shouldn’t just react; they need to explore and learn to exploit weaknesses or cooperate and collaborate. Darwinian evolution and learning, we understand, are the drivers of all novelty on Earth. It could be what drives change in virtual environments as well. Evolution figured out how to create natural intelligence. Shouldn’t we, instead of trying to code our way to AI, just evolve AI instead? Several labs – including my own and that of my colleague Christoph Adami – are working on what is called “neuro-evolution.” In a computer, we simulate complex environments, like a road network or a biological ecosystem. We create virtual creatures and challenge them to evolve over hundreds of thousands of simulated generations. Evolution itself then develops the best drivers, or the best organisms at adapting to the conditions – those are the ones that survive. Today’s AlphaGo is beginning this process, learning by continuously playing games against itself, and by analyzing records of games played by top Go champions. But it does not learn while playing in the same way we do, experiencing unsupervised experimentation. And it doesn’t adapt to a particular opponent: For these computer players, the best move is the best move, regardless of an opponent’s style. Programs that learn from experience are the next step in AI. They would make computer games much more interesting, and enable robots to not only function better in the real world, but to adapt to it on the fly.

There's a Google Glass app for hard-of-hearing users I understand you now! There's a Google Glass app for hard-of-hearing users Georgia Tech scientists have created an app that creates captions on Google Glass for users who are hard of hearing. Sharon Gaudin (Computerworld (US)) 09 October, 2014 07:24 - - - - print email Distributors Synnex Comments Georgia Tech scientists have created an app that creates captions on Google Glass for users who are hard of hearing. A team of researchers from the Georgia Institute of Technology developed speech-to-text software for Google's wearable technology. Using Glass and an Android-based smartphone, the app converts speech to text and displays it on the Glass heads-up display. "This system allows wearers like me to focus on the speaker's lips and facial gestures," said Jim Foley, a professor at Georgia Tech, in a statement. "If hard-of-hearing people understand the speech, the conversation can continue immediately without waiting for the caption. However, if I miss a word, I can glance at the transcription, get the word or two I need and get back into the conversation." According to Georgia Tech, the system works by having a hard-of-hearing person wear Glass while the person he's trying to converse with speaks directly into the smartphone. The speech is converted to text, sent to Glass and displayed on its heads-up display. "Glass has its own microphone, but it's designed for the wearer," said Thad Starner, a Georgia Tech professor and a technical lead for Glass. "The mobile phone puts a microphone directly next to the speaker's mouth, reducing background noise and helping to eliminate errors." The app, called Captioning on Glass, is free and is available at MyGlass. Google has been focused on expanding its app ecosystem for Glass, adding apps for Facebook, Twitter and CNN. Google is still working to move Glass from prototype to an official product. Google offered the eyewear for general sale in May, although Glass still is in beta testing. The company is looking for early adopters, also known as Explorers, while engineers continue to work on the hardware and software, and third parties add to the selection of apps. Earlier this year, Google executives said they expected Glass to be released later in 2014. However, during the company's annual developer conference, they stopped estimating release dates and said Glass will be released when it's ready.

Sign up now Menu ARN Government passes “Google Tax” into law Government passes “Google Tax” into law New laws will come into effect from the beginning of July Leon Spencer (ARN) 28 March, 2017 09:51 - - - - print email Distributors Arrow ECS ANZ Australasian PC Distributors (APCD) Avnet Technology Solutions Bluechip Infotech BMS Technology Dicker Data Ingram Micro Australia Leader Computers Multimedia Technology rhipe Synnex XiT Distribution Comments The Federal Government’s so-called “Google Tax” has been passed into law, with the new legislation, aimed at targeting profit-shifting among multinational enterprises, set to come into effect from the beginning of July. The Diverted Profits Tax Bill 2017 and the Treasury Laws Amendment (Combating Multinational Tax Avoidance) Bill 2017 were introduced into Parliament by Treasurer, Scott Morrison, in February, and were passed by the Senate into law on 27 March, having already made their way through the House of Representatives. In the words of the Bills’ explanatory memorandum, the new legislation aims to “ensure that the tax paid by significant global entities properly reflects the economic substance of their activities in Australia and aims to prevent the diversion of profits offshore through contrived”. Ultimately, the new laws will see some companies that book their profits in international regions that claim a lower tax rate than Australia’s standard 30 per cent company rate slugged with a tax bill based on a rate of 40 per cent. The move to crack down on multinationals’ profit-shifting practices was announced by the government in the 2016-17 Budget. It follows a series of parliamentary inquiry hearings carried out in 2015 that saw representatives from some of the largest technology companies operating in Australia grilled by a Senate committee panel about their tax practices in Australia. Among those under scrutiny were Apple, Microsoft, and Google, all of which have been on the Government’s radar in relation to their local tax practices. In 2013, Labor MP, Ed Husic, singled out Apple over its tax practices, questioning how the company's local operation could accrue $5.5 billion in costs. "How? They don't manufacture here, there are no factories here. I don't know what their R&D effort is here," he said at the time, according to ZDNet.

Now, with the Diverted Profits Tax in place, the Government hopes to see fewer examples of large companies paying a tax rate that falls below the standard company rate, and expects the new measures to raise $100 million in revenue a year from 2018-19. However, the new laws will only apply to multinationals that have a global income of more than $1 billion and an Australian income of more than $25 million. The legislation is also aimed at complementing existing anti-tax avoidance rules such as the Multinational Anti-Avoidance Law (MAAL) to clamp down on artificial profit shifting by major multinationals and increased penalties for breach of tax reporting obligations for global companies with incomes of $1 billion or more.

This exclusion is aimed at ensuring that such entities do not face an unnecessary compliance burden as a result of the introduction of the Diverted Profits Tax.

Gregg Keizer (Computerworld (US)) 28 May, 2015 06:37 - - - - print email Distributors Arrow ECS ANZ Australasian PC Distributors (APCD) Avnet Technology Solutions Bluechip Infotech BMS Technology Dicker Data Ingram Micro Australia Leader Computers Multimedia Technology rhipe Synnex XiT Distribution Comments Apple reclaimed the top-rated brand value spot in Millward Brown's annual review on the back of exceptional iPhone 6 sales last year. The Cupertino, Calif. company, which lost the No. 1 position in 2014 to Google, climbed to an estimated $247 billion in brand value, said the research firm, which specializes in advertising effectiveness and brand equity. Google slipped to No. 2 with its $174 billion value, while Microsoft climbed a spot to No. 3 ($116 billion). Other technology companies in the Top 20 included IBM (No. 4), Tencent (No. 11), Facebook (No. 12) Alibaba (No. 13) and Amazon (No. 14). Brand value, as Millward Brown defined it, is the portion of a company's overall valuation due to the brand name itself, a metric comprising several pieces, including opinions of a consumer panel that totals more than 3 million people worldwide. "Apple displayed remarkable brand strength, returning to the number one position in the ranking based on consumer regard for the brand and its devices," Millward Brown's report read (download PDF). "The brand's iPhone 6 success contributed to an $18 billion quarterly net profit, the largest quarterly profit for a public company ever recorded." Millward Brown cited several other factors it thought contributed to Apple's 67% year-over-year increase in brand value, ranging from Apple Pay to the Apple-IBM partnership announced a year ago. Apple holds the record for the largest increase in brand value: 1,446% over the last 10 years. "Most astonishingly, 10 years ago, Apple, the world's most valuable brand, did not even rank in the ... global top 100," said the research firm. Microsoft, which like Apple moved up a spot this year, also got a thumbs up from Millward Brown, which applauded the leadership change at the 40-year-old Redmond, Wash. company. "In the first year under its new CEO [Satya Nadella], Microsoft refreshed its culture and exhibited greater willingness to be more open and collaborative with its partners and customers," the report said. Microsoft, No. 1 in Millward Brown's first report of 2006 with a brand value of $62 billion, recorded a number nearly double that for 2015. "Microsoft rose ... on the strength of three things: a shift in focus to the cloud, a more collaborative corporate philosophy, and an aura of optimism surrounding the installation of a new CEO," the research company said. In particular, Millward Brown highlighted the March 2014 debut of Office on the iPad, and in more general terms, the sweeping changes Microsoft made to its pricing practice and the discarding of its Windows-first (and in many cases, Windows-only) philosophy. Also in the mix: The decision to give away upgrades to Windows 10 to consumers and small businesses. "Microsoft announced plans to distribute the next version of its Windows 10 as a free upgrade for the first year to people who already own Windows," the researcher said. "The initiative ensures a high adoption rate and the Microsoft brand looks more generous."

Michael Archambault is the Software Development Manager for Accusoft. Despite technology milestones in recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) can still suffer from unintended consequences. In 2016, Microsoft’s Twitter bot, Tay, tweeted racist and highly inappropriate statements after learning from her peers on the platform. Unable to overwrite the malicious information from social learning, Tay’s account was shut down and still remains private. Other incidents like Tay have also surfaced. One of the most notable was with Google’s image recognition software. Google Photos was accused of discrimination after labeling some non-white users as “gorillas.” Google claims the incident was unintentional, yet it remains an issue of concern that turned an overlooked piece of code into an issue of race. Unfortunately, algorithms like Microsoft’s and Google’s are still dependent on human input and their context is limited by the algorithm’s parameters. This is how Tay is unable to determine truth from internet trolling, and why Google Photos doesn’t have the ability to differentiate some non-white users from gorillas. However, this issue exists in more algorithms than we are aware of. This machine-based bias stems from the point when humans program artificial intelligence to automate machine learning. Because humans build the datasets used to train artificial intelligence biases, limitations and human error can affect the output, so the fault lies in how humans are training these machines from the beginning. Machines Are the Products of Human Interaction With AI, humans are the puppet masters. It is the human input that guides machines when they process the information used to classify datasets. In its simplest form, AI analyzes unfamiliar inputs within a database of known values to arrive at the correct output. Just like in human learning, the more algorithms are fed indexed images, the more accurate the software processing becomes. If you train an algorithm with hundreds of cat photos, it will be able to classify a photo of a Siamese that it’s never seen before as “cat.” However, issues can form when algorithms are trained with typical or perfect images in a controlled environment. If developers do not train these machines with data that represents diverse conditions, complications can arise. These issues can even affect unexpected applications of image processing software, like barcode recognition. Standard 1D barcodes consist of alternating black and white bars of various widths that contain encoded value. The scanners process the width by analyzing the width between the bars and matching it to a preselected set of parameters. If the bar is ambiguous due to poor lighting or print quality, the computer is unable to decipher the encoded data. In these cases, a computer is capable of detecting a variety of potential matches, but would need additional information to identify the correct value. A misread barcode can go beyond someone receiving an incorrect product from an online order. In hospitals, barcodes identify patients’ critical health information, like medication-specific allergies; an incorrect or partial scan could lead to serious consequences like anaphylactic shock or even death. Constantly having to correct machine mistakes leaves users vulnerable to these errors. Accuracy Requires Holistic Inputs Scanners are trained to recognize images using perfect examples, like a well-lit, clear photo. In reality, barcodes are often imperfect. Barcodes found on shipping labels can easily become distorted in transport, leading to errors when processing. In order to preempt this, developers need to use a variety of conditions and expand the range of inputs when building algorithms. In the case of barcode scanners, algorithms need to be trained using codes in an imperfect condition. For applications like Google’s Photo assistant, exposing the software to a diverse range of subjects can allow it to correctly identify and achieve the intended results. Like any good teacher, developers must create a realistic environment that the computer can use to process and compare features. For example, a person may see both a tiger and zebra and be able to differentiate the two based on the knowledge that they are different species. However, a computer, if not properly trained, will see the stripes and assume they are a similar classification. Humans know that it is illogical that a zebra and a tiger would be classified the same, but a computer needs to feed holistic inputs in order the clearly decipher the differences. While it seems logical to create a comprehensive database with clear datasets, in reality, most situations have some ambiguity. AI-powered machines have the capability for accuracy when algorithms encompass as many inputs as possible, but this is not a fix-all solution. More input will also expose the same bias present in humans, so how the machines decipher the input and features is an essential factor. As image recognition technology continues to be refined, developers need to be conscious of the images they use in their solutions and the implications it will have on their technology, and in the case of Google, society.

Sign up now Menu ARN Internet giants to block child porn images using a common list Internet giants to block child porn images using a common list Google, Facebook and Twitter are among the companies that will block child sexual abuse images, using a hashed list Zach Miners (IDG News Service) 11 August, 2015 10:49 - - - - print email Distributors Arrow ECS ANZ Bluechip Infotech BMS Technology Dicker Data Ingram Micro Australia Leader Computers Multimedia Technology rhipe Synnex XiT Distribution Comments Fingerprint reader on laptop Facebook, Google, Twitter, Yahoo and Microsoft will take a new step toward combating the spread of child pornography, by blocking images identified in partnership with an industry group. The companies will block images of child sexual abuse that have been identified by the Internet Watch Foundation, a U.K.-based nonprofit that aims to locate and stamp out such content online. The effort is aimed at speeding up the identification and removal of images of child sexual abuse worldwide, and preventing them from being uploaded in the first place. Only known child sexual abuse images identified by the IWF will be blocked. Each company will download a list of images that have been "hashed" by IWF analysts, under a process that creates a digital fingerprint of each image. The hashes are created from images that IWF's analysts have assessed, which come from various online sources like reports from the public, and the U.K.'s Child Abuse Image Database. Hashing the images is designed to make it easier for sites to identify them quickly amid vast amounts of other content. The effort allows for potentially larger numbers of images to be blocked on some of the Internet's most trafficked sites. On an average, IWF said it removes around 500 URLs each day, with each URL containing one to thousands of child sexual abuse images. Many different Internet companies could potentially make use of the hashed list, IWF said Monday in its announcement. Any company that provides services like image search and storage, hosting services, or social media and chat could use the list to identify and remove the images or prevent them from being shared. Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Twitter and Yahoo are five IWF member companies using the list so far. Over time, the list will be rolled out to all eligible members, the group said. Some Internet companies have already been using image hashing technology developed by Microsoft to automatically identify and block child pornography. Microsoft's technology, called PhotoDNA, is designed to identify images even if the image has been altered. Facebook has been using it since 2011 to prevent the upload of known child pornography images. IWF's system uses PhotoDNA as well as other hashing techniques. Still, experts say there are challenges tied to hashing. Changes in the image, like a crop or resize, can still quash the detection. IWF does not hash video, although the group says they're developing video hashing software. Each of the participating sites will download an updated hash list daily, IWF said. It's designed to proactively scan the sites for the known images. Zach Miners covers social networking, search and general technology news for IDG News Service. Follow Zach on Twitter at @zachminers.

Google Maps gains Street View images for directions and a bottom bar for location info, directions, and more Cody Toombs Follow View All Posts 2017/05/12 6:03am PDTMay 12, 2017 30 Plus 1 on G+ 49 Share on Facebook 49 Share on Twitter Total Shares128 Applications Downloads News Videos Go check out the Google Maps app and you might notice a few things have changed since the last time you poked around. In the last couple of days, Google pushed some changes to the Maps interface that add street view images to the directions screen. It seems there's also another change showing up on more recent versions that will also move around a few widgets on the screen. When you begin planning a route between two places, the directions screen will now show thumbnails from Street View with every turn in the list Tapping on the image will open up Street View's full 360-degree viewer and direct it to the location of the turn. In the couple of tests I've done with it, Street View seems to also be oriented correctly for the view you'll have as you are driving – meaning it won't point you at the wrong side of the road. As a bit of trivia, Google first introduced this feature to the Maps web interface right around this time of year back in 2008. There's even a video introducing it. Left: Older example. Right: New example. The other notable change is more widespread throughout the interface, but it's a mostly cosmetic adjustment. Many screens now include a bottom bar with contextual activities, often accompanied by a button on the right side. It takes up more space, but it functionally replaces the FAB (Floating Action Button) on many screens, or at least one of the FABs. This design may remove some confusion for users that don't immediately recognize the icons, but it may take a little longer since some users will have to read more. This is probably an experiment, but Google may eventually add this type of bottom bar to the Material Design Guidelines. These changes appear to have been activated remotely, so it's possible some users saw these much earlier as part of a test, while others may still see the older interface for a while. Street View thumbnails are showing up on versions of Maps going back at least as far as v9.51.1, the bottom bar seems to be limited to v9.52.0 and later.

I don't send small trivial things or whatever. For example, iirc I sent in a tip about Google photos adding support for raw photos several weeks before AP had an article about it. I also pointed out several major details about how it worked that were left out of the article and that AP seemed unaware of.

It's the primary action! Why move it to the bottom when all the functionality is unchanged? I feel like Googlers are trying to give themselves work to do at times, especially when they act askew to their own design guidelines. catalysto I think the standard for the FAB was that there should only be one, so they were already breaking their own rules by having the double FAB. I agree though that if you are looking at a location, the FAB should change to directions. Willie Chalmers III It's in smaller text, but multiple FABs are allowed if they both serve important purposes: https://material.io/guidelines/components/buttons-floating-action-button.html#buttons-floating-action-button-transitions Manard Heh, the Play Store icon for the APK link is out of date...

The local arm of the California-headquartered company has said it will "lodge an objection", according to Fairfax Media. "The company will continue to uphold its positions against any and all such claims," Google Australia reportedly said in its latest filings with the corporate regulator, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC). The move comes after the government passed the Diverted Profits Tax Bill 2017 - commonly referred to as the Google Tax - and Treasury Laws Amendment (Combating Multinational Tax Avoidance) Bill 2017 earlier this year. The two pieces of legislation were designed to target multinational corporations avoiding tax responsibilities in Australia by moving profits overseas. Google Australia reported revenue of $1.14 billion in 2016 but paid just over $16 million in tax, according to its ASIC financial filings. From January 2016, the company restructured to record revenue from selling to Australian-based customers. This resulted in a revenue increase of $644 million. As a result, it declared a profit of $121 million in 2016, an increase from $50 million the previous year and showed the company paid an effective tax rate of 13.7 per cent. During a parliamentary hearing in April 2015, Google, Microsoft and Apple revealed that they were all being audited by the ATO, while giving evidence at a Senate inquiry into tax avoidance. At the time, Google Australia managing director, Maile Carnegie, defended the company’s accounting practices, saying the majority of tax paid by the company was in the US because the company is headquartered there and is the centre for research and development which incurs the most risk. Read more Google Cloud growth is outpacing the company's ad business "And that in turn is what drives our profits," Carnegie said. "It's very easy to underestimate the risks and also the costs that are required ... to develop that intellectual capital." The three global tech giants are among a list of multinational corporations accused of avoiding paying their fair share in local taxes by diverting profits overseas. A practice that has drawn criticism for these companies and their accountants accused of manipulating Australian Taxation law for the benefit of their clients. In September 2016, the ATO put the “big four” accounting firms on alert, issuing a message warning of schemes to avoid the Multinational Anti-Avoidance Law (MAAL), also known as the Google Tax. ATO deputy commissioner, Mark Konza told the Australian Financial Review in September 2016 that he had been at a presentation by a major accounting firm, with a client present, of a scheme to redirect Australian sales through a partnership where only 1 per cent of profits went to the Australian partner and the rest went to a company in a low-tax jurisdiction. Read more ​In the cloud price war, cloud storage has become the new battleground "We only became aware of this new scheme two weeks ago," he said at the time. "We were so disturbed by such a blatant attempt to undermine the will of parliament [in the MAAL] that we fast-tracked this alert."

"It's still mostly sci-fi for now," said Charles King, an analyst with Pund-IT. "Systems are still pretty rudimentary. Though they perform some specific kinds of calculations faster than traditional computers, they are defined by their limitations. When true, fully operable quantum systems come online, they will force the IT industry, public and private sector organizations and individuals to fundamentally rethink certain kinds of problems and all but abandon some conventional solutions." That time is not yet here, but industry analysts say it's getting close. While there has been heated debate in the computing industry and the world of physics over whether one Canadian company, D-Wave Systems, has built a true quantum computer, there is new evidence that its quantum system is showing results. Last week, NASA and Google, which have been testing D-Wave's quantum system for more than a year, announced that its D-Wave 2X quantum computer came up with an answer to one problem 100 million times faster than a conventional computer running a single-core processor. Hartmut Neven, director of engineering at Google, said at a press conference last week that the company's D-Wave quantum computer can handle some problems in a second that would take a classic computer with a single core 10,000 years to perform. The D-Wave machine was tackling a specific problem – one that it was designed to take on. Quantum computers are expected to be focused on specific types of problems, called optimization problems, which require massive calculations and take on incredibly complex questions. Scientists hope that one day quantum computers will be used to help find cures for diseases such as cancer and Alzheimer's. They also could be used to secure computer networks or to find distant, possibly habitable planets. With the success that NASA and Google reported, the industry may be a step closer to having a true quantum computer. In September, NASA and Google signed an agreement with D-Wave Systems to test the company's new quantum computers as they are developed over the next seven years. Google and NASA are using the machines to advance artificial intelligence and machine learning. D-Wave Systems is not the only company working on quantum machines. In April, IBM said its researchers had potentially sliced years off the time expected to create a real working quantum system by making two key advances. Last week, IBM announced that the U.S. Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA) program, part of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, awarded the company a multi-year research grant to continue its push to build a quantum system. Neither IARPA nor IBM have reported the amount of the grant award, citing ongoing contract negotiations. The announcements from D-Wave Systems and IBM are an encouraging sign that progress is being made in this highly complex field. Quantum computing, while tough to build, is also tough to explain. Some of the top physicists in the world admit to not understanding how it works. A classic computer uses ones and zeros – known as bits – to process instructions, and moves through its calculations in a linear way. A quantum computer, though, uses qubits, instead of bits. A qubit has the possibility of being both a one and a zero. Using qubits, a quantum machine doesn't work in an orderly fashion and can calculate all the possibilities at the same time. "It's still very early days for quantum," said Steve Conway, an analyst with IDC. "This is a very controversial and sometimes acrimonious community. The question always is: Is this really quantum computing? D-Wave is at the head of the pack because they actually have a computer built. Some say it's not a real quantum computer, but Google and NASA think it's something worth testing. "And what IBM is talking about here is a grant to advance the research they've already been doing," he added. "It's great that a company of IBM's stature is putting even more effort into something that has the potential that quantum computing has. There aren't too many companies that will dive too deeply into this." But it will be years before quantum computing becomes a serious market, according to Conway, and it will be years before enterprises can consider a quantum machine viable as part of its computing arsenal. "We're not going to see quantum computers give classical computers 24 hours to get out of town," said Conway said. "It's going to take a while. This is very, very advanced, experimental research." Pund-IT's King, though, said advances might be coming sooner, possibly in five to 10 years. IBM's work, he noted, has the potential to drive research forward at a faster pace than expected. "The company has already demonstrated some quantum computing capabilities, including some concepts of error detection and correction," said King. "The fact that IARPA thinks enough of the IBM project to provide a grant, qualifies as a solid vote of confidence. That's excellent news for IBM." It could very well be excellent news for the industry as a whole. "It seems to me that with more energy and funding behind quantum projects than ever before, there's a real chance of building sustainable momentum around the technology," said King. "If that occurs, in a few years we'll be talking about systems that are the stuff of science fiction."

That may not be the case. Google, according to industry analysts, is positioning itself to take on Amazon's dominance. Despite how far back it's lagging today, Google could catch Amazon and some day supplant its top position in the cloud. "Amazon essentially has more than 80 per cent to 85 per cent of Cloud market share in terms of providing platform as a service," said Jagdish Rebello, a research director with IHS iSuppli. "The market is in its infancy, and Amazon sort of created the market so it's got an early lead. It's not a player to be sneezed at. But somebody like a Google could catch up with them." Amazon's Cloud computing platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS), launched in 2006 and immediately drove hard into a market it was basically creating on the fly. Aside from holding as much as 85 per cent of the market today, AWS has more than five times the compute capacity in use than its next 14 competitors combined, according to a 2013 Gartner report. Business isn't slowing for AWS either. Amazon reported last week that in the first quarter ending March 31, sales for Amazon's "other" category, which includes AWS, grew by about 60 per cent year-over-year. That put sales around $US1.2 billion for the quarter, compared to $US750 million for the same period in 2013. The company, which originally made its name as an online bookseller, also has a rich ecosystem that competitors like Google can't touch at this point. "Where Amazon steps ahead is in its ecosystem," said Lauren Nelson, an analyst with Forrester Research. "It has the largest ecosystem out there. You can use their long list of offerings and it's ready to deploy super quickly and it's very automated and scalable. There are thousands of companies that all the work they do is on top of AWS. Some do security. Some handle compliance issues. There are a lot there." Can Amazon hold that position in the long term, especially in the face of increasing competition? Google is considered to be in the forefront of that challenge, but it's not alone. After essentially having the public cloud market to itself for years, Amazon is watching warily as companies like Microsoft, IBM, Hewlett-Packard and Verizon make their own push. There's even talk that Facebook is positioning itself to join the fray and build its own public cloud service. With those challenges ahead, Amazon's continued growth and dominance may come a lot harder. Google, meanwhile, has the best chance of succeeding in its advances on Amazon. According to analysts, Google, the company that dominates online search, stormed the mobile world with Android and eclipsed free email offerings with Gmail, is primed to take on Amazon. Neither Google nor Amazon would offer comment for this story, but here are five reasons that Google can catch up to Amazon. 1. The market is young and prone to change AWS has been around for eight years and other companies have dived into the cloud business, but enterprises and smaller companies are still getting comfortable with storing their data on remote servers on the Internet. The cloud computing is still relatively small but it's quickly ramping up. Forrester last week released a report showing that the public Cloud market is set for what it calls "hypergrowth." Forrester said the market is expected to reach $US191 billion by 2020, a 20% increase over Forrester's last forecast, in April 2011. "Today, the Cloud is small but exploding," said Jeff Kagan, an independent industry analyst. "We're still in the first inning in the game ... Remember how big Blackberry was? Then Apple came out with the iPhone and changed everything. It happens." Kagan said the Cloud computing industry will grow and change -- a lot -- over the next five to 10 years, and the companies in that space will have to grow and change too. "Typically, the first companies that lead are not leading five or 10 years from now," he said. 2. Google has the name and deep pockets Amazon has strong brand recognition, but when people think of the company, many still think about going to Amazon.com to buy a book or a pair of running sneakers. Google, meanwhile, is a name that enterprises well recognize. "When people think about Amazon, they think about the Kindle and the retail angle," Rebello said' "A lot of enterprises are using Google Docs and they're using Gmail. People also are familiar with the Android OS. When you look at it from an enterprise IT perspective, you see that Google is offering services, so you figure you can't go wrong with bringing Google into the equation." Along with that name recognition come some deep pockets. Amazon surely isn't searching the couch cushions for change, but Rob Enderle, an analyst with the Enderle Group, said the company doesn't have the deep pockets that Google does. "Amazon spends pretty much what they pull in," he added. "Google is loaded. If Google decides this is really strategic, they could really surprise Amazon. Google could outspend Amazon any day of the week." Several analysts noted that most companies moving into the cloud are using multiple services. It's a new area and these companies want to compare services and find out which one works better and which one is more reliable. That means a lot of new users may give Google, a name they know, a try. If Google throws a lot of its financial muscle behind its cloud effort, that will open up the possibility that Google can win over those users. 3. Google needs to attack pricing Armed with massive coffers, Google is pushing down the price of using a public cloud, forcing Amazon to follow its lead. Google executives have said cloud pricing should follow a Moore's Law-like pattern, falling by a factor of two every year. That's aggressive and Google seems to be pushing that strategy forward. For example, in March, Google slashed its pricing. Google Compute Engine now costs, on average, 32% less. Google Storage also has been cut, on average, 68%, while prices for Google BigQuery on-demand analysis services were cut by as much as 85%. The day after Google's pricing announcement, Amazon Web Services followed with what was its 42nd price reduction since it started the business. For instance, the price of Amazon's Simple Storage Service was lowered by an average of 51 per cent. "If you think about one of the key drivers of enterprises moving to the cloud, it makes it possible for many small to medium enterprises to have an IT department with minimal upfront capital expenses," Rebello said. "Google is trying to attack the pricing equation. If they do that while also attacking security concerns, then they are attacking the barriers to adoption." Google, he added, has the tenacity to aggressively drive down prices to lure in both businesses new to the cloud, as well as drawing in what had been AWS customers. 4. Google may be making big capital investments Without offering specifics, Google executives said in an earnings call this month that it is focused on capacity and investing capital to make sure it has more than enough capacity to meet clients' needs. "Google is making the capital investments it needs to alleviate some of the concerns an enterprise IT manager might have about going with their cloud services," Rebello said. "If your data is sitting in the cloud, enterprise IT is going to worry about security and having the processing power when you need it. Google wants to make sure you have the power when you need it." That, he added, will make Google a better choice when IT administrators go shopping for a cloud service. 5. Google's future strategy hinges on the cloud Google is placing the cloud at the centre of its strategy to enable the company to remain a major Internet player in the years to come. Early this year, Google bought Nest Technologies, a company that makes a smart-home thermostat that can be programmed from users' mobile phones. Google spent $3.2 billion in cash for the company that will put Google squarely in the connected-home market. Rebello pointed out that Nest is also a Cloud-based player. The smart thermostat will sit in people's homes but its smarts will reside in the cloud. Since Nest is just the first step into a smart home that will have smart appliances, smart door locks and windows, the cloud will be needed to store all of that new information in the trend known as the Internet of Things. "If you talk about a future where lights, doors, windows and appliances are all connected through a digital gateway, the thermostat is just one element, but it's a key element that can learn consumer behavior and adapt to it," Rebello said. "This is all a cloud strategy. If Google wants to be a player in this smart home market, it needs the Cloud behind it." Google's focus on the cloud is unlikely to waver, making it a long-term challenger to Amazon's cloud dominance. Many people in IT say the future lies in the Cloud. They're just trying to figure out how to get there, how fast to get there and which service they'll go with. That opens a big door for Google. "I don't think we'll be looking at a company that's in the number one position steadily," said Kagan. "It'll be an ebb and flow. I would say Google and Amazon will be beating the heck out of each other." This article, 5 reasons why Google can catch Amazon in the Cloud, was originally published at Computerworld.com.

Apple said it has joined RE100, a global initiative by influential businesses committed to using 100% renewable electricity. To date, RE100 has amassed membership from 77 corporations. Other RE100 members include Hewlett Packard Enterprise, VMware, Rackspace and Wells Fargo. Apple's announcement is mostly symbolic at this point. The company is already powering its operations in the U.S., China and 21 other countries with 100% renewable energy, and, in 2015, powered 93% of its operations around the world with renewable energy. Apple has invested in renewable energy for several years. Lisa Jackson, Apple's vice president for Environment, Policy and Social Initiatives, said Monday that the company completed construction on its latest renewable energy project — a 50-megawatt (MW) solar farm in Arizona, Apple worked with local utility Salt River Project on the solar array, which will provide renewable power to Apple's global command data center in Mesa, Arizona. The solar farm provides power equal to the energy use of more than 12,000 Arizona homes. Apple The Singapore solar project is the first distributed utility-scale installation in the country. Solar energy developer Sunseap Group will provide Apple with 100% renewable electricity from solar energy systems built atop more than 800 buildings in Singapore. Last year, Apple announced it would invest $850 million in a solar power plant through a partnership with First Solar, one of the nation's largest photovoltaic (PV) manufacturers and a provider of utility-scale PV plants. Through a 25-year purchasing agreement, Apple will get 130MW (megawatts, or million watts) from the new California Flats Solar Project. The First Solar deal rocketed Apple past Walmart as the largest corporate user of solar power. On the same day Apple joined RE100, Bank of America also announced it was committing to RE100. America's top tech companies have been going green in a big way, so much so that the availability of clean energy resources is a key consideration in where they locate corporate offices and data centers. The move is designed to save them millions of dollars in long-term energy costs. "We believe energy is the future of our business," Josh Henretig, director of environmental sustainability at Microsoft, said in an earlier interview with Computerworld. Last year, Google announced it would purchase 842 megawatts (MW) of clean energy, nearly double the clean energy it had already purchased -- taking the company to 2 gigawatts (GW) of clean energy. Creative Commons Lic. The Googleplex is Google's corporate headquarters in Mountain View, Calif. The company has committed to tripling its purchases of clean energy by 2025. Put in context, 1 megawatt (MW) can power roughly 200 homes, so Google's purchase could power about 168,000 homes. Google has pledged to triple its renewable energy purchases by 2025. Last year, Apple also joined with 12 of the largest companies in the U.S. to launch the American Business Act on Climate Pledge, a White House initiative to have corporations commit to reduce their emissions, increase low-carbon investments, deploy more clean energy, and take other actions to build more sustainable businesses and tackle climate change. Despite only being a few months old, the RE100 collaborative already boasts corporate signups from companies in India, China, Europe and the U.S. "Research shows that in the U.S. alone, doubling energy productivity by 2030 could save $327 billion annually in energy costs and add 1.3 million jobs to the economy, while carbon dioxide emissions would be cut by approximately 33%," RE100 stated on its website. "We're happy to stand beside other companies that are working toward the same effort," Jackson said during remarks at Climate Week in New York City on Monday. "We're excited to share the industry-leading work we've been doing to drive renewable energy into the manufacturing supply chain and look forward to partnering with RE100 to advocate for clean-energy policies around the world." Apple is also a member of The Advanced Energy Economy (AEE), a trade association representing the renewable energy industry. "We're thrilled that Advanced Energy Economy member Apple has committed to run on 100% renewable energy and also sees the need to improve policy," AEE CEO Graham Richard said in a statement Tuesday. "They are upping the ante as they manage their energy needs, a trend we are seeing among our corporate energy buyer members." Last month, Apple glass supplier Lens Technology in Beijing announced it would run its Apple operations entirely on renewable energy. The clean energy commitment by Lens was combined with a zero waste compliance agreement for all of its final assembly sites. Solvay Specialty Polymers, which supplies Apple with antenna bands for the iPhone, also pledged to use 100% renewable energy for all of its Apple production. The commitment will cover 14 manufacturing facilities across eight countries by the end of 2018. Catcher Technology, one of Apple’s largest aluminum enclosure suppliers, also is targeting 100% renewable power for its production of Apple goods by the end of 2018. Altogether, Apple suppliers' commitments to date will represent more than 1.5 billion kilowatt hours per year of clean energy used in the manufacturing of Apple products by the end of 2018, equal to the amount of electricity consumed by more than 1 million Chinese homes.

IHS, an industry analyst firm, Thursday said its researchers are projecting that sales of Automotive Safety Integrity Level-compliant microcontrollers and processor units will grow from $69 million last year to almost half a billion dollars by 2020. Automotive Safety Integrity Level-compliant microcontrollers have to meet road safety regulations. IHS also noted that analysts expect revenue for sensors used for autonomous applications, like optical sensors, to grow seven-fold from 2013 to 2020. "Google has made a leap with a pure driverless car - a car without human intervention, steering wheel and acceleration or braking pedals," IHS said in a statement. "This leap will boost revenue growth for semiconductors over the next five to six years." "Unlike today's autonomous cars, Google's driverless car totally depends on its sensors, semiconductor integrated circuits and algorithms running inside several electronic control units," the statement said. "The absence of human intervention in driverless cars demands higher functionality--via algorithms and chips." Google has been working for several years on the development of a self-driving car. Prototypes have been put to the test on highways and even city streets. Google last week disclosed that it has built an autonomous car from the ground up - one with no steering wheel, no accelerator and no brake -- and there's no way for a human to take over. Google executives have even reached out to the auto industry in Detroit to form development partnerships. Nonetheless, the company has yet to put a timeline on when its self-driving car will be ready for sale. Patrick Moorhead, an analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy, said he thinks the IHS projections are solid even though it's still unclear when Google's autonomous cars will become generally available. "I think the forecast is reasonable given most mid-tier and all premium-tier cars have camera systems," said Moorhead. "I think 10 years from now, we will be in a stage of hyper-growth for autonomous cars. Remember, Google isn't the only one working on these. Every major carmaker has completed prototypes." The autonomy built into any car - whether it's a fully autonomous car or one that can simply parallel park itself - needs computer chips to function. "To produce a good driverless car, you essentially need to put yesterday's small super-computer in your car," said Moorhead. "The car needs to see so you need a lot of different kinds of cameras. That data needs to be processed in real-time to recognize the objects it sees and determine an immediate course of action. That requires a lot of new silicon that wasn't required in previous cars."

Owlchemy Labs, makers of Job Simulator and Rick and Morty: Virtual Rick-ality, joins Google Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/05/10 5:18pm PDTMay 10, 2017 15 Plus 1 on G+ 17 Share on Facebook 35 Share on Twitter Total Shares67 Games Google News Videos Google and Owlchemy Labs are ready to get schwifty together, as the one has now eaten the other like so many Pac-Man dots on the field of VR games. Both companies made their coordinated announcements earlier today. Google has been expanding their VR efforts pretty aggressively recently, so it's not too surprising. Although Owlchemy has produced Android games in the past, as of yet none of their VR works have been for the platform. There is no doubt that in the nascent market of virtual reality games, Owlchemy is one of the better names to have risen. They're quick and prolific, having produced Job Simulator as a launch title for the Oculus and HTC Vive, as well as following the success up quickly with Rick and Morty: virtual Rick-ality. The studio claims, following a test of the DK1, they vowed never to look back to boring flat-screen games again, and their efforts in the genre have resulted in immediate recognition and praise. Alas, that the above Rick and Morty game is not for Android. Owlchemy Labs' products are among the best (and funniest) out there, so I don't think it's any surprise Google would have expressed an interest if they wanted to buy a VR content producer. The folks over at Owlchemy are very excited about the deal. I hope that the extra resources from being a part of the great Googopoly result in more good VR times for us as consumers. Let's hope we can see some of their games ported over to Daydream. Wubba lubba dub dub.

James Henderson (New Zealand Reseller News) 11 May, 2017 05:00 - - - - print email Distributors Australasian PC Distributors (APCD) Avnet Technology Solutions Dicker Data Hills Synnex Comments VMware has expanded its partnership with Google, leveraging Workspace One, AirWatch, and Horizon technologies to accelerate the adoption of Chromebooks in the enterprise. Revealed at Dell EMC World 2017, the agreement enhances existing application accessibility of the devices, with Workspace One enabling one-click secure authentication and management of applications - cloud, web and virtual - for organisations deploying Chromebooks. “VMware has been working with Google since 2015 to offer secure Android devices and applications, most recently with advanced support for Android Enterprise,” VMware senior vice president and general manager end-user computing Sumit Dhawan said. ”This partnership shows our commitment to giving customers the flexibility to pick the device of their choice and enabling the delivery of any application on any device to end users.” Currently, Chrome OS provides multiple layers of protection including security modules, such as Trusted Platform Module (TPM) chips specialised for encryption, alongside verified boot to check for compromises, sandboxing for containing threats and full disk encryption for data protection. Together with Workspace One on Chromebooks, Dhawan said IT administrators stand to benefit from additional security capabilities to help deploy, configure and secure, web and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) applications. “We are also collaborating on advancements to unify native Android applications,” Dhawan added. “Windows applications can also be delivered through VMware Horizon 7 and VMware Horizon Cloud virtual applications and desktops, that can be quickly accessed through dynamic contextual decision-making, secured in the data centre and provisioned through Workspace One.” Dhawan said end-users can now utilise single sign-on to a digital workspace, in addition to greater levels of security.

To better enforce its policy regarding access to user data through its APIs (application programming interfaces), which states that apps should not mislead users when presenting themselves and their intentions, Google is making changes to the third-party app publishing process, its risk assessment systems and the consent page it displays to users. Google is an identity provider, which means other web apps can use Google as the authentication mechanism for users accessing the app. Apps use the OAuth protocol to do this.Â These apps can also use Google's APIs to send users requests for information stored in Google's services. Last week, a large number of users received a well-crafted phishing email that asked them to view a document in Google Docs. Clicking on the link redirected them to a Google OAuth consent page that said an application called Google Docs wanted access to their contacts and Gmail accounts. The reason this spoofing attack worked is that there was no mechanism to prevent a third-party app registered to Google's OAuth service from using the same name as one of Google's own apps -- or the name of another legitimate third-party app. Since the attack, Google has strengthened its risk assessment for new apps and made other changes to better detect such abuse. So app developers might see error messages when registering new applications or modifying existing ones in the Google API Console, Firebase Console, or Apps Script editor, the Google Identity Team said in a blog post. On top of this, based on the results of the enhanced risk assessment, some web applications will need to undergo a manual review and approval process that could take from three to seven business days. "Until the review is complete, users will not be able to approve the data permissions, and we will display an error message instead of the permissions consent page," the Google identity team said. For now, developers will only be able to request a review during the application testing phase, but in the future, Google will also allow review requests during the registration phase. Until the app is reviewed, developers will be able to continue testing their app using their own account, as well as to add additional testers.

Name: Subject: Message: Google Pixel 2 wishlist: what we want to see Features Newsby Kris Carlon20 hours ago 62 812 43 The original Google Pixel definitively proved that it’s what’s inside that counts. You would have been forgiven for thinking that gutting an HTC project with nine months to go, transplanting its HTC soul for a Google one and releasing it onto the world with a brand new skin could have turned out disastrously. But that did not happen. The original Pixel was an unlikely triumph under a huge amount of pressure. Google had never made a phone by itself before and the Nexus line had never been a mainstream success. The new Pixel launcher was bound to be controversial considering its departure from stock Android, and the addition of several Pixel-exclusive features, to the exclusion of Nexus owners, was always going to upset Google’s most loyal fans. See also: Results are in: The best Android smartphone camera is… 3 days ago Fast forward a half year and the Pixels have firmly established themselves as worthy of the first “Google Phone” title. Google miraculously nailed smartphone photography on its first try, the software experience is even smoother (not to mention richer) than on Nexus phones, a massive marketing budget put the Pixels in front of millions of folks and they have already enjoyed far greater success than any Google smartphone effort in the past. So with the Google Pixel 2 destined to arrive in a few months’ time, it’s time to start compiling our wishlist: what we want to see weighed against what we’re likely to see. The Pixel team has already shared a few hints of what to expect, while others are merely educated guesses. Regardless of the source, here are six things we’d like to see in the next Pixel phones. A better design While the Pixels have slowly grown on me, there’s still no denying they are far from the best designed phones in the pile. Their origins in HTC’s design lab is obvious, and even with that odd glass panel and Really Blue color option, they’re still more “quietly brilliant” than they are “phones by Google”. With a full development cycle in its pocket this time around, Google should be able to deliver a Pixel successor that is every bit what they want it to be. No corners cut to save time, no shoehorning software into an existing design. The Pixel 2 should have plenty of time to become the first real “phone by Google” without having to rely too much on the manufacturing OEM. Will the Pixel 2 follow in the design footsteps of the original, as inherited as it was from HTC? But that raises a question: will the Pixel 2 follow in the design footsteps of the original, as inherited as it was from HTC? Nexus phones never maintained a design language and maybe Pixel phones won’t either, we’ll just have to wait and see. But if Google wants to play the same mainstream game Apple and Samsung are playing, recognizability matters. Finally, a better lead-in time will hopefully also mean we won’t see some of the same design quirks the first Pixels shipped with. I’m thinking about things like the scratch-prone glass panel, the anodized color application that constantly seems to want to rub off and the giant bezels. Water-resistance Google has essentially already admitted an IP rating was on the table for the original Pixel but that time ran out (it still has an IP53 rating though). So it’s pretty much a given that the Pixel 2 will be dustproof and water resistant. Better speakers The body of the Pixel may have come from HTC, but it sure doesn’t sound like the speakers did. While having poor speakers is kind of common for a lot of Android phones, if Google wants to position the Pixel as every bit the equal of the iPhone, the Pixel 2 is going to need a better audio experience. Whether that comes via speakers, a DAC or a built-in amp, the only way to go is up. The body of the Pixel may have come from HTC, but it sure doesn't sound like the speakers did. Fortunately, Google has an intimate knowledge of various approaches to smartphone audio, having worked with multiple OEMs on Nexuses past. The Nexus 6P’s stereo front-facing speakers were received very well and when Google asked the Pixel community for feedback, stereo front-facing speakers were high on the Pixel 2 wishlist. With all the brouhaha about enhanced audio in Android O, as the official Google phone, the Pixel 2 needs to have better audio capabilities than the original. The way I see it, we win no matter what. If Google decides that minimizing the bezels is more important than putting front-facing speakers on the Pixel 2, we get smaller bezels. If not, we get stereo front-facing speakers. Or… we get big bezels and the same crappy speaker, but I don’t even want to think about that possibility. An even better camera The Pixel camera may still have one of the best – if not the best – smartphone cameras around, but the camera game never rests and neither should Google. Dave Burke, Android’s vp of engineering and Android camera engineering lead Tim Knight have already indicated that the current Pixel camera was simply the first swing at bat and that the work was only getting started. Low light performance and enhanced machine learning will be key to next Pixel’s camera, with rumors claiming the Pixel 2 won’t see a significant change in resolution count or hardware. Rather, the Pixel 2 camera will reportedly rely on advances in the image processing algorithm for its improvements. Considering how fantastic a job the Pixel camera team did under the gun on the first Pixel, I’m perfectly happy with this. The Pixel 2 camera will reportedly rely on advances in the image processing algorithm for its improvements. Adequate supply Even now, months after the original release of the Pixel, several options are still unavailable. This is the kind of thing we might have expected from first year OnePlus, but not from Google. The Pixel hype is real and the marketing is everywhere. But if those two factors can’t coalesce into a purchase then it means Google has dropped the ball hard on something it should know inside out: advertising. After all, you can’t sell something you don’t have. Fortunately, Google isn’t the kind of company to worry about burning vast stacks of cash on all manner of whacky premises. So investing a truckload of money on as sure-fire a bet as manufacturing as many Pixel 2s as it can fit in the storeroom is a no-brainer. Perhaps the demand for the original Pixel was far greater than even Google could have projected. Fair enough. But now that Google knows it has a hit on it hands, we shouldn’t have to see the same mistake made twice. Better battery life Again, if the original Pixel was indeed a gutted HTC project, then major modifications to the chassis and internals may not have been possible if the phone was going to meet its deadline. That’s OK, but Google surely knows that the battle for the hearts and minds of mainstream consumers is waged on two main fronts: camera and battery life. The Pixels are OK. They have average-sized batteries and last OK for phones of their size and display resolution. But there’s nothing earth shattering going on. Given Google’s complete control over the entire hardware project and the software that runs on it, there’s very little reason to expect anything less than the most perfectly harmonized battery life ballet in the Pixel 2. When all is said and done, the Pixel 2 is likely to be one of the stand-out phones of 2017. Considering what Google managed to achieve in just three quarters of a year with the first Pixel is truly remarkable, so with almost two years to work on the Pixel 2, we shouldn’t be disappointed. No smartphone is perfect, but by the time the Pixel 2 arrives, it will have had plenty of time to get as close to Google’s vision of the perfect phone as it possibly can. The best part of all is that Google seems really open to customer feedback; if even a little of that gets added to the mix, we’re in for a real treat. What have we missed?

License plate readers worried FBI lawyers, documents reveal As license-plate-reading technology spreads and huge databases are built up across the U.S. that could be used to track innocent people's movements, it emerges that the FBI had its doubts, at least for a while.

Just click 'buy' -- coming soon to Google search results Google will include a "buy" button in its search results on mobile devices in the coming weeks, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing unnamed sources.

European telcos split on sanity of blocking Google's ads After some European mobile service providers were reported last week to be considering a scheme to block Google's mobile ads across their networks in a ploy to force the search giant to share revenue, a few other big carriers have stepped forward to say the plan is ill-conceived. Both Deutsche Telekom and Swedish operator TeliaSonera said they would not engage in the plan; a representative of the latter pointed out that Google's apps and services drive traffic, and data consumption, and tangling with it doesn't make sense.

GOPers on FCC want to delay net neutrality vote The two Republican members of the Federal Communications Commission want to put a last-minute roadblock in the way of a proposal to reclassify the Internet as a utility and put stronger net neutrality protections in place. In a move that's unlikely to succeed, Commissioners Ajit Pai and Mike O'Rielly want to delay the vote scheduled for Thursday, and have the FCC open the 332-page proposal to the public for comment. An agency spokeswoman said that the FCC already has already gotten "unprecedented levels of public comment on a variety of options" for net neutrality rules.

Sharon Gaudin (Computerworld (US)) 22 November, 2016 08:11 - - - - print email Distributors Synnex Comments With presidential election signs coming down from front lawns and voters watching protests on the news, many are wondering if fake news stories on Facebook and Google contributed to Donald Trump's winning the presidency. And that raises the question of what Google and Facebook plan to do about it. Here are some examples of headlines from fake stories posted to the web: "Pope Francis endorses Trump" "WikiLeaks Confirms Hillary Sold Weapons to ISIS" "Donald Trump wins electoral college and popular vote" "Clinton Foundation bought $137 million worth of illegal arms and ammunition" These headlines are from fake news stories that littered Facebook and Google in the past few months. While the content was wrong, it didn't stop them from pulling in hundreds of thousands or millions of likes, shares and comments. With these stories, truth was beside the point. Or maybe spreading false news was the point. Fake news spread around the world on social networks, as well as on Google News and in Google searches. "Americans get most of their news off both of these sites," said Patrick Moorhead, an analyst with Moor Insights & Strategy. "I believe readers, Facebook, and Google all play a role in bringing this to a successful conclusion." Here is what you need to know about how fake news is affecting what you know about the world and what is being done about it. 1. How big a problem is this? There are no clear numbers on how many fake news stories hit Facebook and Google during the election season. Nor are there any figures on the number of fake news stories that appeared on those sites all year. To be clear, there also is some debate over what makes a news story fake. Take for example the totally false and concocted story over the summer that said the pope endorsed then-Republican nominee Donald Trump for president. The pope did not endorse Trump. Is it a story that has an omission or an error? "I think until we start to define the issue more clearly, it's open for a variety of interpretations," said Brian Blau, an analyst with market research firm Gartner. "Users want to trust not only the providers but also the content they consume, and given the lack of fine-grain controls, we have to assume that some amount of fake news is being read and trusted, which isn't a good situation for anyone." Most agree that to be considered fake, a story needs to be largely false or purposefully false. To that end, Mark Zuckerberg, CEO and co-founder of Facebook, said in mid-November that most of the stories that show up on users' news feeds are real news pieces, downplaying the affect that fake news has had on Facebook's more than 1.18 billion daily active users. "Of all the content on Facebook, more than 99% of what people see is authentic," Zuckerberg wrote on his personal Facebook page . "Only a very small amount is fake news and hoaxes. The hoaxes that do exist are not limited to one partisan view, or even to politics. Overall, this makes it extremely unlikely hoaxes changed the outcome of this election in one direction or the other." If Zuckerberg is right and 99% of stories on Facebook are accurate, does that mean 1% are false? If that's the case then, if a user sees 500 news headlines in her News Feed every week, five of them are fake. And if those fake news stories purposefully have salacious headlines, will those five headlines stick in her brain more than 1% of news stories normally would? Add to that the fact that Facebook uses algorithms to show readers more of the kinds of stories they normally respond to, read and share, then some users might be seeing a much higher percentage of fake stories. 2. What's the effect of fake news stories? According to a Pew Research Center survey of 1,520 adults conducted between March 7 and April 4, 68% of U.S. adults are Facebook users. In addition, a majority of Americans say they get news via social media, and half of the public used these sites to learn about the 2016 presidential election. The Washington Post went right to the source, interviewing a man who is a fake news writer. According to the Post report , fake news writer Paul Horner is taking credit for Trump's winning the election, saying, "I think Trump is in the White House because of me. His followers don't fact-check anything — they'll post everything, believe anything. His campaign manager posted my story about a protester getting paid $3,500 as fact. Like, I made that up." Meanwhile, Zuckerberg said over the weekend in a blog post, that Facebook is working with fact-checking organizations to verify the authenticity of news on its site. So it’s unclear at this point how much fake news stories affected the outcome of the election. Some claim they helped Trump pull off an upset win. Others disagree. What is clear is that people read these stories, commented, liked or were angered by them. They also shared this content with their friends and family. These stories, filled with lies and propaganda, made the rounds, and some chose to believe them. 3. How does Google fit into all of this? Fake news stories is not just a Facebook problem. Google is mired up to its knees in this, as well. A story saying that Trump beat Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in the popular vote, as well as in the Electoral College, made it to the top of Google News in the days following the election. It was a fake story. Clinton won the popular vote, but Trump secured the 270 electoral votes needed to win the presidency. When people want to know something, they generally turn to Google. Want to know which candidate won the state of Utah or Virginia? Google it. Want to know if the pope endorsed a candidate? Google it. If fake news stories are appearing in searches and Google News spots, misinformation is being propagated. 4. Why can't fake stories simply be eradicated? There are a number of issues with this question. Do users want companies like Facebook and Google deciding what is true or not? For example, Is it a fake story if one fact is wrong or is it only a fake story if the entire premise is wrong? How does an algorithm distinguish the difference? Also, do users want Facebook, for instance, to decide what they can and cannot share with their friends? "The problems here are complex, both technically and philosophically," Zuckerberg wrote in the weekend post. "We need to be careful not to discourage sharing of opinions or to mistakenly restrict accurate content. We do not want to be arbiters of truth ourselves, but instead rely on our community and trusted third parties." As to who makes the final decisions about what is fake and what is real news, it will be a human/machine team. Algorithms will be used to pick out likely offenders and mark them for further inspection. At that point, humans likely would make the final decisions. To do this, algorithms will need to be updated, become more sophisticated and be rigorously tested before they are unleashed on the Facebook and Google worlds. 5. What's being done to cull fake news stories from our News Feeds and searches? While Google did not respond to a request for information, Reuters reported that Google, while not addressing the issue of fake news, is working to change its policies so websites that run fake content will not be able to use its Adsense advertising network. Google's move is aimed at cutting out much of the financial benefits of creating fake news. As for Facebook, Zuckerberg said the company is working on a list of changes that he hopes will curb the amount of fake news on the social network. In his weekend Facebook post, he noted that the company is working on making it easier for users to report fake stories; tagging stories that have been flagged as false with warnings; changing the companies ad policies to make it harder to make money off fake stories, and developing technology to better detect fake news. Jeff Kagan, an independent industry analyst, said artificial intelligence and machine learning eventually will be part of the solution to fake stories, by analyzing news articles much faster and more efficiently than humans can. But he's not sure when the technology will be ready to do that. "I am sure machine learning is part of the solution but [these technologies] are still in their infancy and are only so helpful today," he said "The solution is complicated."

Maps is getting social. Zach Maier, a product manager with Google Maps, announced in a blog post Monday that users can create lists of their favorite places, places they want to visit and share those lists with friends within the app. "Starting today, you can create lists of places, share your lists with others, and follow the lists your friends and family share with you -- without ever leaving the Google Maps app," Maier said. To make Maps a social tool, users open the app on either the iPhone or Android platform and then tap on, say, a restaurant, museum or club. Tap on the Save icon and it will add the spot to one of several pre-set lists, such as Want to Go or Favorites, according to Maier. Users also can create their own lists. To find their lists, people can go to Your Places on the side menu of Maps and open the Saved tab. Maps' new feature also is designed to show your saved places on the map itself. "Because sharing is caring, we made it easy to share lists like "Best Views in SF" via text, email, social networks and popular messaging apps," noted Maier. "Whenever friends and family come to town, tap the share button to get a link and start flexing your local knowledge muscles. Once you send a link to your out-of-towners, they can tap "Follow" to pull up the list from Your Places whenever they need it." According to Google, the lists can be seen and shared on mobile devices and desktop computers. Users also can download the maps to use when they're offline. The new feature is another step in social media for Google, which has struggled to bust into the social media world. Google+, the company's rival social network competing with Facebook and Twitter, wasn't the hit the company had hoped for. Google seems to be taking a different tack now, taking one of its most popular apps and making it social. "This is a dramatically different way of them approaching social," said Patrick Moorhead, an analyst with Moor Insights & Strategy. "Instead of starting big and horizontal like Google+, they're starting small. It's a very different tack, but worth a try. Google's horizontal approach hasn't worked so far." Going social with Maps, which so many people use, may be an easier way to get people sharing destinations with friends. And that would mean more eyes and more time on a Google product. "Google has an excellent Maps product," added Moorhead. "People want to know if their friends like or have been at a certain place and trust their friends more than anyone else. Therefore, I think this has a chance." Arrow APEX Puts Partners in F1 Pole Position More from Arrow ECS Follow Us Twitter LinkedIn Join the ARN newsletter!

By: Priyanka Dua Published: Saturday, May 13, 2017, 16:00 [IST] The search engine giant Google today announced a new project titled Project Treble for to make Android better for users and their ecosystem partners. "One thing we've consistently heard from our device-maker partners is that updating existing devices to a new version of Android is incredibly time-consuming and costly. Adding that with Android O, we've been working very closely with device makers and silicon manufacturers to take steps toward solving this problem, and we're excited to give you a sneak peek at Project Treble, the biggest change to the low-level system architecture of Android to date,"Google wrote in the Android developers blog. The company says that Project Treble aims to do what CTS did for apps, for the Android OS framework. The core concept is to separate the vendor implementation - the device-specific, lower-level software written in large part by the silicon manufacturers - from the Android OS Framework. SEE ALSO: Another offer: Reliance Jio launches new 'My Vouchers' feature It's powered by the new Vendor Test Suite (VTS) and is conceptually similar to the Compatibility Test Suite (CTS), which lets developers write apps that work across devices running on different hardware from different manufacturers. Google further said: "Project Treble will be coming to all new devices launched with Android O and beyond. In fact, the new Project Treble architecture is already running on the Developer Preview of O for Pixel phones." With a stable vendor interface providing access to the hardware-specific parts of Android, device makers can choose to deliver a new Android release to consumers by just updating the Android OS framework without any additional work required from the silicon manufacturers," the company further added. Furthermore, Google is urging the chip makers and OEMs to make changes to the AOSP code. The Project Treble is already integrated into the first Developer Preview of Android O, which is currently available for Pixel and Nexus phones.

It’s been hard to ignore CBRS of late, as everyone from Google to the big carriers to GE has been touting the potential benefits of indoor and outdoor LTE services within shared 3.5 GHz spectrum opened up by the FCC for commercial use. We’re talking carrier-based cellular service extensions, cable companies looking to get into wireless as well as private LTE networks within enterprises, sports stadiums and conference centers. Such services promise to complement -- and in some cases replace -- Wi-Fi, as well as pave the way for 5G wireless services “3.5 has pretty good potential to disrupt the enterprise market,” says consultant Chetan Sharma, fresh off surveying the scene at the big Mobile World Congress show in Barcelona. “It has much better performance [than the alternatives].” Adds Iyad Tarazi, CEO of CBRS player Federated Wireless: "A lot of the hurdles to creating a private LTE system are going away." Given that CBRS involves an innovative new spectrum sharing scheme, it has had to overcome early skepticism, such as from the WiMAX Forum and certain entities in the utility industry. Even now, more trials and government approvals will be required before CBRS spectrum, long reserved for specialized users such as the U.S. Navy and satellite service providers, can be employed commercially. But early rollouts are expected by year-end, so it's essentially full speed ahead for CBRS. MORE: Everything is built to connect to the internet, so why can’t I?  CBRS activity cropped up at Mobile World Congress last year, but the action was even more brisk in advance of this year's MWC and at the event itself: *The CBRS Alliance announced that all of the Big 4 U.S. carriers have now joined its ranks, as has Samsung, bringing the total number of members near 40. The Alliance was formally introduced in February of 2016 with six founding members who had come together the previous summer, and has since added the likes of Cisco, Huawei and Comcast. *Qualcomm and Nokia, two of those founding CBRS Alliance members, along with GE Digital, announced a private LTE-based trial network for industrial IoT. Qualcomm and Nokia also joined forces with Google parent company Alphabet’s Access Group to demo a private LTE network over CBRS spectrum at the Las Vegas Motor Speedway, where fans were taken inside race cars via 360-degree virtual reality. *Alphabet’s Access team demonstrated a handful of consumer gear such as smartphones and Mi-Fi devices working with CBRS base stations and launched a program for testing whether CBRS base stations work with its Spectrum Access System (SAS). *Federated Wireless, another of the founding CBRS Alliance members, disclosed that it has received conditional certification from the FCC for its cloud-based spectrum controller for enabling CBRS deployments.  Federated also revealed it is partnering with Nokia to provide a CBRS-based LTE offering, and has tested its SAS with radio gear from Ericsson. *The Small Cell Forum and CBRS Alliance, whose members and focus overlap to some degree, are working on a liaison agreement, according to the former. *A slew of vendors, including Accelleran, Ruckus Wireless and SpiderCloud Wireless, all had CBRS-related demos at Mobile World Congress. CBRS ALLIES Neville Meijers, VP of Business Development at Qualcomm Technologies and chairman of the board for the CBRS Alliance, says “operators are looking at [CBRS] for additional allocation of spectrum they can utilize for broadband -- some fixed, some mobile -- and there are a number of ideas around private LTE networks with respect to campuses, enterprises and industrial IoT… This is a near-term opportunity.” A Verizon VP last week told Fierce Wireless that the carrier plans to use 3.5 GHz spectrum “as soon as practically possible,” for example. CBRS Alliance/Qualcomm CBRS Alliance Chairman Neville Meijers: "A lot of regulators are looking to the U.S. on the CBRS band." CBRS will attract providers who already own spectrum, including those dabbling in LTE-U services that share spectrum used by Wi-Fi networks, as well as those who don’t own spectrum, Meijers says. Coverage will easily handle the inside of a home and require just a couple of small cells in an enterprise; outdoors, line-of-sight distances supported could extend beyond a mile. The 3.5 GHz (3550-3700 MHz) band at the heart of CBRS has been identified by the FCC as an underused resource, but one that still needs to be handled smartly to avoid any possible interference with applications by incumbents. So the FCC has put rules in place requiring SAS and environmental sensory networks to manage the fair and safe use of the spectrum both by Priority Access License holders to be determined via an auction likely to be held in 2018 or 2019 and by everyone else, lumped into the General Authorized Access bucket. Google and Federated Wireless are the first two outfits to jump into the spectrum management pool, and have begun testing their offerings with one another as well as with other assorted vendors in the wireless market.  MORE: Wi-Fi hotspot blocking persists despite FCC crackdown The FCC has already been doling out licenses for vendors to perform trials, and is working with the Wireless Innovation Forum (WInnForum) to come up with an equipment certification process for later this year. As William Graff, ‎Global TCB Program Manager at testing laboratory TUV Rheinland, says: It's a challenge building “radios smart enough to wake up, listen before they talk and figure out how not to stomp on each other.” The CBRS Alliance will add an extra layer of certification to ensure that LTE providers in this spectrum band won’t mess up each other’s services. While chipmakers, service providers and other equipment makers have been among the earliest supporters of CBRS, end user device makers have been slower to embrace the opportunity, at least publicly. Apple, HP and Lenovo are among those that have not signed on as alliance members. One reason for that could be that the FCC hasn’t provided a lot of information on exactly what equipment makers will need to do to make their products work in 3.5 GHz environments. “I just had a question from one of my clients – and I went and sent something right to the FCC -- about the implementation of Part 96 [of the FCC rules] and whether people who have Part 90 stations are going to have to flip them into Part 96 and in what time period,” says TUV’s Graff. In theory, manufacturers with Part 90 radios might be able to just change out some of the logic to comply, he says. CBRS Alliance’s Meijers says:  “If the big handset vendors support the band then there will be a rich and robust handset ecosystem, and that is largely driven by the large mobile network operators in terms of specifying their own device requirements. But outside of that there are a lot of device manufacturers who are interested in providing modules for IoT purposes or tablets or laptops that would also be connected into the network.” ENTERPRISE OPPORTUNITY Federated Wireless has been a mover and shaker in CBRS from the start, having written the charter for the CBRS Alliance and recruited Intel and Qualcomm as founding members. The Arlington, Va., company plans to deliver its spectrum controller to existing service providers, cable companies and new managed service providers such as building management companies as well as integrate it with OEM gear such as access points and small cells. Applications such as point-to-multipoint, small cell backhaul and last-mile fiber replacement will emerge first, CEO Tarazi says. But the former Sprint and Nextel VP is particularly bullish on the opportunity for private LTE networks in the 3.5 GHz band and the path such 4G networks could provide to 5G. Private LTE networks supporting IoT applications in factories and refineries could very well start emerging late this year or early next year, Tarazi says. Federated Wireless Federated Wireless CEO Iyad Tarazi: "If anyone would tell you today there is too much spectrum available... we'd all laugh." It was important to get Intel involved in CBRS from the start, Tarazi says, to ensure 3.5 GHz technology would get built for general purpose computing devices such as laptops in much the same way Wi-Fi support did. “This is not some kind of closed carrier system,” he says. That’s crucial in that the 3.5 GHz band is actually shaping up as a 5G wireless band in other countries that didn’t have the spectrum allocated for specific applications as the United States did. “This sharing system allows the United States to participate in 5G over time… and have global coordination and harmonization,” Tarazi says. “Both Intel and Qualcomm have announced chipsets that are compatible with 5G that are in the 3.5 GHz band.” Tarazi foresees 4G services up to 1Gbps and 5G services 5 to 10 times that, especially for outdoor point-to-point and last-mile replacement purposes. Private LTE services will blow away Wi-Fi for applications such as streaming 4K video, he claims. The hope is that if resource sharing in the 3.5 GHz band pans out that lots more spectrum will be freed up for sharing. And that goes beyond the United States. Meijers of the CBRS Alliance says the world is watching how the U.S. 3.5 GHz experience goes. "There is really very little spectrum under 6 GHz and even in millimeter wave that can be cleared very quickly and licensed out," he says. "So the shared model is one that a lot of regulators are looking to the U.S. on the CBRS band to actually prove out. And if we are able to prove out that people can utilize the spectrum efficiently and fairly, then I think a lot of regulators would be extremely interested to deploy the same kind of model to free up shared spectrum in their own markets, whether it be in LTE or 5G in the future."

Google's "Project Treble" will modularize Android to make updates faster Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/05/12 12:42pm PDTMay 12, 2017 95 Plus 1 on G+ 162 Share on Facebook 76 Share on Twitter Total Shares333 Android O Android OS Development Google News Easily the most annoying aspect of using an Android phone (with the exception of Pixel/Nexus) is slow updates. Android 7.1 (which came out last year) currently sits at 0.5% marketshare, and brand new phones are still being released with 6.0 Marshmallow. Google is aiming to solve this with "Project Treble," which will modularize part of the Android OS to decrease the time OEMs spend updating their devices. If you're not familiar with how Android updates work, here's a summary. Google releases a new Android version, which silicon manufacturers (e.g. Qualcomm, Mediatek) have to supply drivers for. Once that's done, device makers (e.g. Samsung, HTC) can start re-adding all the tweaks they have made to the new Android source code. In the case of carrier-sold phones/tablets, device makers then have to wait for the carriers to approve the update. After all that is done, users finally start to receive the update. Google is hoping to speed up this process with Project Treble, which changes the architecture of Android. Essentially, a new 'Vendor interface' will contain all of the low-level software for a device - like the chipset drivers. Google will work with chipset manufacturers to make sure the Vendor interface is forwards-compatible, and the interface will be validated by a Vendor Test Suite (VTS). The aspect of this news I'm most excited about is that the Vendor interface is forwards-compatible. There have been many cases where chipset manufacturers have not updated drivers for specific popular chips, preventing devices using them from being officially updated to newer Android versions. One example is the Nexus 5 and other Snapdragon 800/801-based devices, which were never officially updated to 7.0 Nougat. It sounds like the Vendor interface will prevent this from happening, or at least prolong the end of support for a given chip. Google says that Android O will be the first version to use the new Vendor interface, and the Android O Developer Preview already has it. Hopefully we'll hear more about Project Treble at Google I/O next week. Source: Android Developers Tags Android android o project treble treble vendor interface vendor test suite vts subscribe ...

Hopefully this means Google can update more core system functions similar to Google Play Services independent of the OEM/carrier path. Mike Updates still have to go through carriers, this just helps prevent devices from early EoL and should make OEMs jobs easier by not having to rewrite every piece of code to work with new drivers. TechGuy22 that's why this is useless. carriers are still involve and OEM like samsung takes time with their own skin destinyhud thats why i buy pixel. also, like mentioned this will reduce the amount of modification needed in android's new version which means slightly early release. even if its 2 weeks early i am good wit it TechGuy22 or or you can push google to make things easier for carriers and OEMs and not bandages i have an S7 edge and a pixel xl. go figure Taco Monster You can't make things easy for someone who doesn't want to do said things. bekifft It's why I buy Pixel too but the whole point of Android was supposed to be freedom and choice. If my only real choices are Google or Apple, I might as well buy a damn iPhone. PI This Daniel Not necessarily. All the OEM has to do is bring their crap (skin) from the last android version. Of course that probably only happen with small android updates (8.1?) Zsolt V Why shouldn't they? By all accounts, they add value so it's worth the wait. CA-Sandra Fuchsia is a very long term project. It's not going to replace Android anytime soon. Dextro I've been saying for ages that Android needs an hardware abstraction in the vein of what Windows has in its driver model. Hopefully this is it and helps get those updates out faster. Sadly I expect that the endless stream of UI customization OEM make will end up killing any kind of benefit this brings. Corbin Davenport I want something like that too, but I'm not deeply familiar with the technical structure of Linux/Android, so I would assume sure there some massive limitation that is keeping that from happening. Dextro I think (but am now 100% sure on this so don't quote me) that Linux historically hasn't had any such abstraction. Drivers are meant to be inside the kernel and compiled for each specific version. That works fine if the code is open source and committed to the kernel repos but it becomes a nightmare for binary blobs. The kernel makes no allowances for stable driver APIs, they will break stuff and won't worry for anything outside of the kernel if I remember correctly. That's probably part of the reason why Android has failed to keep up with Linux kernel versions. keithzg The kernel makes no allowances for stable driver APIs, they will break stuff and won't worry for anything outside of the kernel if I remember correctly. I wouldn't really say this is true. In fact, there is a very stable API provided by the Linux kernel. Hell, one of the most famous Linus rants was about this very topic: It's a bug alright - in the kernel. How long have you been a maintainer? And you *still* haven't learnt the first rule of kernel maintenance? If a change results in user programs breaking, it's a bug in the kernel. We never EVER blame the user programs. How hard can this be to understand? WE DO NOT BREAK USERSPACE! https://lkml.org/lkml/2012/12/23/75 Obviously drivers are trickier, but they're still expected to continue working. The big catch comes in that ARM drivers tend to come as compiled binary blobs. There really isn't an allowance for that in the workflow of things for Linux; good citizens are supposed to provide source, and then new kernel versions and the drivers therefore (often within the kernel itself) are recompiled, and everyone's happy. But while the API remains the same, the ABI does not; drivers compiled as modules for an older kernel won't work on newer ones, even though the drivers would almost certainly work fine if they were recompiled. The ARM space is utterly lousy with proprietary drivers (in no small part this is Qualcomm's fault, although they're far from the only offender). Hence you have Google forever backporting kernel updates to older kernels, so that the ABI remains consistent and older device drivers continue working. Dextro Well, I stand corrected then. But one question then: I was under the impression that drivers were not in userspace but in kernelspace. That's why I didn't even think much of that famous Linus rant. keithzg True, they're (generally; FUSE, for instance, is an area of exception) in kernel space, and that rant isn't entirely applicable because of that, but for practical purposes that just means ABI changes break drivers. And the kernel devs do reserve the right to change the in-kernel API at any point, which could in theory break drivers---it's just that in practice they are rather worried about such breakage and don't wish to do so, and barely break it more than they do userspace. When you think about it, it'd kindof be an insane amount of maintenance if people had to update driver code for new kernel versions! Luckily for "desktop Linux", most drivers these days in the x86 space are open source (NVIDIA is remaining holdout, although even there you can fall back to the Nouveau drivers most of the time), so they're just baked into the kernel or provided as kernel modules, and in practice don't really have to be touched by human hands after they're originally written. Unluckily for Android, that is very much not true in the ARM hardware world. Hell, most Chinese OEMs will just flatly refuse to provide kernel source, even though they're legally obligated to do so. Gaurav Kumar Which is why fuchsia has a stable ABI...like windows. I agree it's not coming anytime soon but it may not be that far away as well.. Lawstorant in the linux world, the answer is DKMS. There's no need for kernel catch-up anymore. I bet Google is doing something similar. Сергей Бугаев Android has the HAL https://source.android.com/devices/#Hardware-Abstraction-Layer -- but it haven't been helping much, as we can see (or would it be much worse without it?). It'd be interesting to see more technical details about Tremble to understand how it's different. Andy J https://developer.android.com/things/index.html pretty much this is what they are aiming for - from the days of Project Brillo. "System updates and support: We provide the system image, updates, fixes, and more, so you can focus on creating compelling products" Brillo/Things is the same idea - there is the low level vendor stuff, the actual OS and then the OEM stuff. Google can update the OS on running devices in the field, without worrying about the vendor stuff or the OEM stuff. Knowledgeborn Allah Exactly... And, unfortunately, this probably isn't going to be anything like Microsoft's new update process for Windows 10 Mobile, which doesn't have to go through carriers. Based on all the software modifications most Android OEMs make with their devices, this probably won't speed up OS updates at all. More powerful devices may last slightly longer, but that will still leave it to the OEMs to support those devices for longer periods, and they likely won't do that anyway, since they're constantly trying to get you to purchase the next one... Zsolt V Windows 10 what? Knowledgeborn Allah Dismissing Windows 10 Mobile (and rightly so) doesn't change the fact that Android needs to learn a few things from them. Their update process, at least right now, is still miles ahead of anything Android is doing. Google should've followed the path that Microsoft already laid when it comes to updating software systems outside of the carriers. It looks like they took one thing that's beneficial but disregarded all the other necessary parts... ¯_(ツ)_/¯ Zsolt V As in how to drop 50% of the devices with the Creators update? No, thanks, Google has nothing to learn from that process. Knowledgeborn Allah Again, you're still missing the point... This isn't about dropping support for any devices with the Creators' update. This is specifically about them bypassing carriers to directly deliver updates to their consumers, which they can sustain for longer periods of time. Google has a lot to learn from that process. Zsolt V Doesn't matter. The end result is the same, the user doesn't get an update. You are missing the point, maybe you don't have one? Knowledgeborn Allah Maybe I don't have one? You sound like an idiot, bud... Maybe you have difficulty reading. I specifically stated in my original post, which you replied to, what the point was: "And, unfortunately, this probably isn't going to be anything like Microsoft's new update process for Windows 10 Mobile, which doesn't have to go through carriers." Again, the point was based on the fact that Windows 10 Mobile updates - regardless of how many people actually have Windows 10 Mobile devices, or how many devices will be discontinued due to the Creators' update - don't have to go through carriers. That's the point. Android as a platform can learn a lot from that. Before making ridiculous replies about a subject and, in effect, making yourself look dumb, maybe you should read the post you're replying to first. Just a thought. PVL_93_RU Windows 10 mobile is dead Knowledgeborn Allah https://www.onmsft.com/news/latest-windows-10-mobile-updates-bypass-carriers-update-phones-directly Say what your want about Windows 10 Mobile when it comes to development, but it's definitely not a good look when a "dead" platform can update their devices better than Android can. 🤦🏾‍♂️ Robabobbob So which windows phone OEM is actually making a modification anything close to what android OEMs do? Knowledgeborn Allah That's not the point... The point is that you can separate core Android OS functions from the themes and launchers inherent in other variations of Android provided by other OEMs. Right now, Android's update process is a disaster. Even after the OEMs push out updates to their devices, it still has to go through various carriers to actually get to consumers, showing that the carriers are actually the ones in charge. Windows 10 doesn't have that problem. iOS doesn't have that problem. Android has that problem. bekifft I agree completely about the HAL, but the real problem remains the network operators retaining strict control over user devices. If AT&T doesn't want to spend the money to add AT&T Navigator, AT&T Device Locator, AT&T Messages, etc etc etc, they will simply not deploy the update. SomeGuy112 This is great, gives the potential for much longer OS update support, especially for Googles own hardware. Hopefully the OG Pixel gets longer than 2 year OS support because of this. destinyhud good point Dn Bro Didn't the article say the new devices with O will have this? DragoCubed The dev preview for the pixel has this project. We can assume it's staying with the pixel MrHanMan So, is it Trebble, or Treble? Jdban Treble according to the google docs Corbin Davenport It is Treble, I can't spell. Fixed. Jeff The trouble with Trebbles... destinyhud i really hope this fixes the 2 week delay in getting major update to nexus devices /s John Doe This is good but Google need to do more. They need to modularize everything in the Android update process. Create a separate carrier update so the baseband can be updated separate from the OS and same to drivers and also OEM skins/Apps. This should have FIVE different updates paths: 1) Core OS/Kernel update path 2) Driver update path 3) Baseband/Carrier related Apps update path 4) OEM Skin/Apps path 5) Security update path This way Google can control the Security, Core OS, Baseband, and Drivers by working with carriers and silicon manufacturers. Also if T-Mobile for example wants to push an update out for the baseband and messaging/phone apps they can do that independent of Google and OEMs. The same goes for Samsung and Qualcomm and others. Latheryin You are confused on one part. What you call skins are not what you think they are. All of the OEM versions of android are completely different distros that replace core OS files and frameworks with their versions. John Doe I know but If Google were to modularize it then it would just be a "skin" or "theme" that is separate from the framework/OS this will give Google control over the main OS and the only way to do that is to not allow OEMs to modify it too much. Latheryin Which would remove all the extra features that devices add on. Many have to be tied into the frameworks and other base OS drivers and libs. There is no separation in it really. And with the way they licensed Android they cant really control a whole lot. Any OEM could easily reverse anything Google does and still release it. John Doe Well yeah of course Google can't do that alone they would have to make new agreements with OEMs and carriers. Most OS skins do not have that many extra features and Google can create APIs to allow OEMs to modify anything they want like if Samsung wants to add an Iris scanner as a password or whatever. The point is OEM "skins" need to become more like launchers in the play store like Nova and Apex and If OEMs want to modify something they would have to ask Google like how Microsoft treats windows. Latheryin You really dont have a great understanding of how things work. That will never hap=p=en. Maybe with Googles second mobile OS they might try to have more control. John Doe How about instead of being an arrogant prick, you tell me what I said is incorrect or what Google cannot do? Why do you think this cannot happen? Microsoft did this with Windows mobile. Like I said, Google would have to sign new licensing agreements with OEMs and Carriers but they probably have to revise it for this Project Treble anyways. Google already uses its Apps and Play store as a bargaining chip to update those agreements. Latheryin Ok first. Google would have to change the license under which android is licensed. Which can't be done. Also have you ever ripped Android apart and had a look? I would guess not as if you had we would not be talking about this. As for what we does does. That really is apples and oranges. Not even close e same thing. The apps and play store are not really that big of a deal. There are hundreds of android devices released every year that don't include them and they sell really well. John Doe You said NOTHING I have not said already. Why Google cannot change the Android license? What stops Google from implementing this since you are the Genius that ripped Android apart and decided this cannot be done? Google already has MADAs in place and they update them every few years with OEMs. Those devices are mostly in China since Google services are banned there. If the Play store is not a big deal then Samsung would have forked Android a long time ago. But go ahead I am still waiting for your "intelligent" replies. Even Amazon's fire phone failed miserably without the play store and Google apps. Latheryin Have you even read the license? Do you really have any idea what happens when something is licensed? Doesn't take that much really. Anyone can look at the code. Heck some of the best android developers are teens. Samsung already did. It's called tizen. Also Samsung is not the end all of devices. They even have a separate store for the devices they run with Android. All Samsung apps don't even hit the Play store. They are Android devices for the common man. Made for everyday people. Ask your favorite developer what device he runs. Look if you want to know more why not dig in, instead of trying to get into a tech conversation when you don't really know too much about it. John Doe Licenses can be updated and their MADAs can be updated which they already do. Samsung did not fork Android, they created a different OS. And that is not turning out very well for them. You still have not told me how what I said cannot be implemented. You should go get one of those Teen Android developers to help you out before you just turn down ideas that you have know nothing about. If Google wanted to they can change Android to how Windows does updates there is nothing stopping them from doing that and OEMs will not fork Android if they did that. I love how you just criticize arguments without providing valid reasons instead of just saying Android does not allow you to do that provide factual reasons or STFU. klaus666 Could this also help to port LineageOS to a smartphone once LineageOS is adapted to this new modular system? jgarrido I dunno, sounds like treble to me... JD OK I get that Google is essentially making what in the Windows World is the HAL and breaking that out of the Kernel and they're essentially creating a lower level API (For lack of a better term) to segment off Android from the OEM mods. However what is actually stopping the OEMs from sayin' fuck this ain't working out let me go in there and refork it anyway. I mean API's are there, now and OEMs should be using that to interact with Android but Android is coming up short so they fork it and custom build the ROM with their own customization and branches. For the longest time the camera stack was a HUGE reason for doing this, even now the Camera2 API is still coming up short, which is why Samsung Completely branches on their own for that too. freshprince_87 Google simply needs to make it mandatory for carriers /OEMS to update their devices and release new phones in the most current version of Android Adnoxaei They could make it a requirement for access to the Play store. Without this interface, that would have been very restrictive. With this interface, customizations can still easily exist, so companies may be more willing to cooperate...espevially if it cuts down on the time needed to test and deploy updates boop By the sound of it, the Vendor Interface is for SoC manufacturers, not device makers. jcopernicus Sweet! Can't wait for my Z3 Compact to get this update! NubCake This doesn't sound like a treble idea at all, hopefully it helps the slow updating process. Knowledgeborn Allah I see what you did there... 🙄😂 ddevito No bass.... Tom Westrick But what if a user is all about that bass? Killa Then they might be in treble if that's all they are about. Sorry, couldn't help myself. :P Emergency Medical Hologram Bassed on what? Martheen Cahya Paulo There's plenty of tweeter surrounding it. Dolby so if we consider the stereo type. Testraindrop While this is certainly a step in the right direction, I somehow doubt that this will change Googles attitude to abandon their own devices after 2 years. Its not like the SOC in the Nexus 5 stopped working when N was installed, in fact its working fine, developed by independent individuals without having "to work with chipset manufacturers", which Google apparently couldn't even achieve. Also the times where google stops updates for the N6 and the Pixels is already set, so even with a chipset blob that is "forwards-compatible" there wont be any further (official) updates. Also if those Vendor APIs will have limits to certain OS aspects like camera, sound etc., then manufacturers will not use them and will just fork again the OS as done currently. saf1927 The custom ROMs that work on Nexus 5 devices don't actually benefit from a lot of things that an officially supported device would. Qualcomm has completely abandoned the chip so from a retail perspective, it's not suitable anymore. Even the "security updates" that these ROMs show in "About phone" aren't actually all implemented, since none of the proprietary blobs and binaries could be updated. Just because a device can be updated with a custom ROM, doesn't mean it's actually running it well. someone755 "Just because it's running it well doesn't mean it's running it well." Welp. saf1927 Wait, what? I can't find that sentence anywhere and I don't remember editing the comment. AbdulB1 Mediatek and in some cases​ Qualcomm (for Nexus 5,sd800,801) don't want people to stay on old phones they try to force them to buy new phones for latest Android version. I am not sure will they be happy about this change? I suspect they will flood market with phones running Android nougat instead. They will try to resist this change by Google. saf1927 Mediatek and Qualcomm aren't device makers, they are silicon manufacturers. AbdulB1 Mediatek charges device makers for new drivers for latest Android versions. Qualcomm stopped supporting sd 800/801 for Android Nougat and thus even sony a device maker who was developing Android N developer versions for a SD800/801 stopped. Chipset makers also have huge clout , it not just sensor makers who decide to support or not their older hardware for newer Android release. saf1927 Well, my point is that none of the silicon manufacturers will force anyone to make only Nougat phones, like you claimed. AbdulB1 "Google will work with chipset manufacturers to make sure the Vendor interface is forwards-compatible, and the interface will be validated by a Vendor Test Suite (VTS)." so if Vendor dont get validated for VTS then do you expect any chances of Android O for those devices? dizel123 I suspect if OEMs want to release new phones with the latest OS version because that's what their users want(I know I'm making assumptions) and Mediatek and Qualcomm try to force them to release phones with Nougat, then Intel will suddenly become a dominant player in the mobile market. This would be exactly the kind of "in" they're praying for. AbdulB1 Intel architecture is quite old , I owned 2 Intel based Android tablets. Intel even didn't bothered to upgrade the OS from 4.0.4 and other one had 5.0 as latest release even it though it was buggy as hell and every hardware vendor went for 5.1 instead. Intel had an edge of running windows along android on their cpu tech. But lack of proper built in modem destroyed their chances in Android world. Their SOCs still had quite high consumption even after releasing newer and newer generations of Mobile SOCs. dizel123 I don't have any inside information, but I'm guessing Intel is working on fixing their problems and making high quality SOCs Cakefish Intel dropped out of the mobile SOC wars. It cancelled development of all upcoming chips last year, I believe. dizel123 Their announcement at this year's Mobile World Congress as well as their current road map on their website both indicate that they're still developing mobile SOCs Cakefish So has it changed since this? -> http://www.anandtech.com/show/10288/intel-broxton-sofia-smartphone-socs-cancelled dizel123 Read my last comment again Lateef Alabi-Oki Jesus! What took them so long? pfmiller I believe there are performance costs to adding hardware abstraction. Google may feel that mobile hardware is finally at a point where it's worth the cost. Justin Martin This was my question. What is it going to do to performance. Not that I'm a Samsung user, but how much will touch wiz suck now? AbdulB1 Will it help in churning out custom ROMs? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I actually want the vendors to work on Android itself, not just their layer. They fix a lot of the bugs that Google leaves in. saf1927 They are already working on that: "In addition to the architectural changes, we're working with our silicon and device partners to take their code changes, such as features for a carrier network in a specific country, and move them into the common Android Open Source Project (AOSP) codebase. For example, Sony and Qualcomm contributed dozens of features and hundreds of bugfixes to Android O so they no longer need to rework these patches with each new release of Android." Simply put, some vendors contribute more than others. Sony is a great example in that regard. They contribute a lot. dizel123 This might just be the best thing Google has ever done to Android Eddie Ringle If you want to see more technical details, here's a bit of what I found back in March when the Developer Preview was released: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13928385 SHunter Orrrrr.... https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/7b191be55920725d6f6aba09c97c1e1942bdfb290cb4cf53e2cb9e23c706626c.png Eumelanin Knight Better late than never. Let's hope Carriers and Manufactures don't have their way and muck this up some how. bekifft At least they're being up front about the problem finally and making it an official "project." It seems like every year the promise is "we're fixing battery this time" and "we're fixing updates." Every year. Never gets better. And with the current FCC and the network operators only set to get worse about their abusive practices, I don't hold out much hope for this plan. What it boils down to is if there is any possible way for network operators (carriers) to meddle with the update, they will. This practice truly aught to be illegal, but see above. Maybe this will at least help lazy to the point of negligence OEMs (Lenovo) not be so appallingly slow. Islam sounds like a joke to me. John C.S. Lock When you finally giving up on Android after 10 long years , here we come iOS ! charfarstar I'll believe when Pixel 2 comes with 4 years of OS updates. MeCampbell30 Turn the treble up in my headphones. Régis Knechtel OMG! I can't believe they're finally doing something about it! https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/5acada086a36a588b7289e5b2a26d7c5f205e0b15a6c77c9b631f1a387dc8d2a.gif Cypher Hey guys and gals, let's add more abstraction to make this slug of an OS even slower! But hey, at least you'll get more frequent updates so that it can get slower more often! xyz People have been telling Google to use their muscle with the chipset makers forever. Qualcomm didn't release drivers is not an acceptable reason to not update Android. Sir_Brizz Hardware manufacturer doesn't release drivers is a perfectly acceptable reason not to update. Consumers should level their hatred at the right target. Blaming Samsung, for example, for Qualcomm's shortcoming won't change Qualcomm's policies. Andy J So last year it was A/B updates from Project Brillo and this year it's the ability to update the OS independently from the low level chipset drivers and the OEM stuff - which is also something Google developed for Project Brillo. While there are no actual Project Brillo / Android Things products in the market yet - it was definitely a worthwhile project for them with these rewards. (Yes I'm aware Chromebooks had A/B updates - but from everything I have heard, they still came about because of Project Brillo, even if Project Brillo wasn't an actual thing when they found their way to Chromebooks) kelpa32 it take google untill android O to try to get updates on time. Urmil Shroff Am I dreaming? Is this really going to happen? PI -This things don't work as u r expecting it ., Google can make guidelines but cant force OEMs to follow it . Oem will still not pass this ,, they will rant about high testing methods and quality benchmarks , ultimately they will pass it for devices only which they want (flagships) only ,, PVL_93_RU This is huge for Android in general. Of course the ideal way of doing things is following ChromeOS model where Google is entirely in charge of managing and updating the software, but then we'd lose out on what makes android unique, which is OEM skins Still though, modular updates are hopefully the next step that will really accelerate how fast devices receive OS updates. Especially mid-range and budget models Patel Nisha I swear I see something like this for every release but yet never happens Paul It's all fine and dandy but I suspect most phone companies still wont upgrade them because they want us to upgrade to newer phones so keeping older phones on older firmwares is in their interest so I don't think much will change. In any event, I'm happy that Google is doing this because it's one less excuse phone companies have to not upgrade their phones, but personally, I think Android could do with something like what Windows does with upgrades so almost any hardware can upgrade to the latest Androids without the manufaturas getting in the way. TonGi018 This is really exciting news! Android Developer Will this also lead to more updates, over a longer period of time ? boop Potentially, as it eliminates the forced EoL when the SoC manufacturer drops support, but it's still up to OEM and Carriers to develop and distribute updated. Android Developer Maybe for Google Pixel , at least? Maybe more than 2 years of updates?

Google is offering you one today Sharon Gaudin (Computerworld (US)) 25 February, 2016 07:54 - - - - print email Distributors Synnex Comments When you do a search about a product you want to buy or look for recommendations for the best Asian dumplings in town, you don't want to wait long for a site to come up on your mobile device. You don't even want to wait three seconds. Starting today, Google is moving to make it faster for you. The search giant has announced that it will alert users in their search results page to corresponding webpages that have been optimized to run fast on smartphones and tablets. "Access to information is at the heart of Google's mission," wrote David Besbris, Google's vice president of engineering for search, in a blog post. "Unfortunately, today, the mobile web isn't living up to the expectations people have for getting the information they need, particularly when it comes to speed. In fact, data shows that people abandon websites after just three seconds if the content doesn't load quickly, which is bad not just for people trying to get what they want online, but for the publishers who want those readers to enjoy the content they've created for them." To deal with this, last October Google teamed with other industry players to launch what it called the Accelerated Mobile Pages Project (AMP), an open source initiative to make the mobile web as fast as possible. The move to highlight users with optimized web pages is part of that project. "In just over four months, AMP has come a long way, with hundreds of publishers, scores of technology companies and ad-tech businesses all taking part in this joint mission to improve the mobile web for everyone," wrote Besbris. "And starting today, we'll make it easy to find AMP webpages in relevant mobile search results, giving you a lightning-fast reading experience for top stories." When a mobile user searches for a story or topic on Google, webpages using AMP specifics will appear in the Top Stories part of the results page. According to Google, those optimized webpages will be, on average, four times faster and will use 10 times less data than equivalent non-AMP pages. This should be a move that mobile users, an increasing market, will love, according to Zeus Kerravala, an analyst with ZK Research. >"When users are mobile, they're typically looking for something in a hurry -- a place to eat, directions, reviews, something they're shopping for. And consumers hate waiting. Users want instant feedback when browsing, and if it's slow, they'll just click on something else," he said. The issue for enterprises running those webpages is that if they haven't yet optimized for mobile or if they're not in the process of doing so, they could easily be overlooked in Google's mobile search results. "The mobile web will be the new battleground for leadership," Kerravala said. "Sites that aren't mobile optimized will become less and less used and wind up becoming irrelevant." However, with people increasingly using their smartphones and tablets to search for information, enterprises should be moving to optimize as soon as possible. That's a win for mobile users, Google and businesses, said Ezra Gottheil, an analyst with Technology Business Research. "Speed is very important," he said. "Time is our most precious asset. This pays off for everybody." Gottheil said Google will benefit because the faster results will help keep users from switching to competitive search engines, and faster pages means more searches per minute, which should bump up Google's revenue.

The bug affected the validation for some SSL certificates issued by Symantec, one of the world's largest certificate authorities, as well as by GeoTrust and Thawte, two CAs that Symantec also controls. The bug was introduced in Chrome version 53, but also affected the Android WebView component that Android apps use to display Web content, said Rick Andrews, senior technical director at Symantec in a blog post Friday. To fix this problem on Android, end users should upgrade to the most recent version of WebView and to the upcoming Chrome version 55, he said. "Developers using Android Open Source Platform (AOSP) will need to review their own apps to ensure compatibility." Even though it's a system component, starting with Android 5.0 (Lollipop), the WebView is delivered as an application package that's upgradeable through the Google Play store. Version 55 of the Android System WebView was released on Dec. 1, but Chrome for Android is still at version 54, which was released in late October. Google made changes in version 54 of Chrome on Windows, Mac, Linux and iOS, as well as to Chromium and the Chrome Custom Tabs so that Symantec certificates no longer trigger trust errors. However, the issue is fully patched for all platforms in Chrome version 55, Andrews said. The bottom line is that to be on the safe side you should upgrade all your Chrome-based software to version 55 as soon as it becomes available for your platform. For many platforms, this version was released on Dec. 1. The problem actually originated with Google's decision to force Symantec to publish all the certificates issued by the company's CAs after June 1st to a public Certificate Transparency (CT) log. This decision was taken after an internal Symantec investigation into the unauthorized issuing of an extended validation (EV) certificate for google.com last year missed over 150 other certificates issued without approval from domain owners. Symantec said at the time that the certificates had been issued for testing purposes and never actually left the company. Since CAs depend on browser vendors to trust their root certificates inside their products, companies like Google, Mozilla, Microsoft and Apple can hold them to account when they violate certificate issuing rules. Following the Symantec incident, Google implemented a mechanism in Chrome version 53 to only trust certificates issued by the company after Jun. 1, 2016, that comply with the Certificate Transparency policy. However, another mechanism in the browser sets a 10-week limit for trusting CT data, to avoid such information becoming stale. When this was combined with the CT-compliance check enforced for Symantec certificates it triggered unintended trust failures even for compliant certificates.

Skip to content Fone Arena The Mobile Blog Menu Main Site Phones Gadgets About Media Coverage Advertising Contact Tip Us Twitter FB Youtube Google’s Project Treble will allow OEMs to deliver faster Android updates One of the major struggles of the Android ecosystem has been the delay in updating devices to latest version of the OS. Google is introducing a new tool dubbed as Project Treble, that might fix Android’s biggest problem. Google says the main aim of Project Treble is“re-architecting Android to make it easier, faster and less costly for manufacturers to update devices to a new version of Android.” Google announced that starting with Android O, all devices will be coming with Project Treble. The company is calling this a “modular base for Android,” and says it is the biggest change to the low-level system architecture of the operating system to date. Google is introducing a new vendor interface between the Android OS framework and the vendor implementation. The new vendor interface is validated by a Vendor Test Suite (VTS), analogous to the CTS, to ensure forward compatibility of the vendor implementation. Iliyan Malchev, Project Treble team lead wrote in a company blog post, Project Treble aims to do what Compatibility Test Suite (CTS) did for apps, for the Android OS framework. The core concept is to separate the vendor implementation — the device-specific, lower-level software written in large part by the silicon manufacturers — from the Android OS Framework. With a stable vendor interface providing access to the hardware-specific parts of Android, device makers can choose to deliver a new Android release to consumers by just updating the Android OS framework without any additional work required from the silicon manufacturers. The new Project Treble architecture is already running on the Developer Preview of O for Pixel phones.

When they remove "violent terrorist imagery or terrorist recruitment videos or images" from their platforms, the companies will include in a shared industry database the hashes, or unique digital fingerprints, of the content. Other participants can use the shared hashes to help identify matching content on their hosted consumer platforms, review against their respective policies and definitions, and remove the content when appropriate, according to a statement by the companies on Monday. “There is no place for content that promotes terrorism on our hosted consumer services. When alerted, we take swift action against this kind of content in accordance with our respective policies,” the companies said. The move comes shortly after members of the European Parliament from the Civil Liberties Committee voted Monday to back stricter initiatives to counter terrorism, including measures to take down and block content that constitute public provocation to commit terrorism. On Thursday, the EU Internet Forum, a private-public partnership set up last year with internet companies, is also meeting to take stock of measures to reduce online terrorist content. Terrorist organizations like the Islamic State group are believed to use social media for propaganda, communications and to attract new recruits. Google, Facebook, Microsoft and Twitter agreed with the European Union in May to remove from their websites illegal hate speech, visible in Europe, that could incite hatred or acts of terror. But in August, a panel of lawmakers in the U.K. said it was "alarming" that social networking companies have very small teams to monitor billions of accounts for extremist content. On Sunday, the European Commission said internet companies, including Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and Microsoft, will have to act faster to counter online hate speech or face laws forcing them to do so, according to news reports. No personally identifiable information will be shared when hashes are passed among the companies, according to the statement. The four companies will begin sharing hashes of the "most extreme and egregious terrorist images and videos" removed from their services, which they describe as content most likely to violate all their content policies. A recent study by the Global Network Initiative, a group that represents academics, investors, civil society organizations and companies, has cautioned against the human rights risks of censoring online terror content. Internet companies acting as intermediaries should not be required to monitor third-party terrorist content that they host or transmit, or face direct or indirect liability from governments for such content, according to the study. Such requirements and liabilities may lead companies to go overboard in the removal of controversial content, according to the report. The companies don't expect to share hashes until early next year after the technical work is completed. They are also open to including other firms that are interested in joining the initiative in the future.

Sprint CEO Dan Hesse, however, thinks carriers might be getting a bit ahead of themselves. GOOGLE REED-ER: AT&amp;T wireless chief slaps down T-Mobile's comically misleading new ad SLIDESHOW: CTIA 2012 product primer The issue, as Hesse outlined it in his keynote speech at CTIA this week, is that carriers have still not definitively solved the "dumb pipes" conundrum - that is, how do carriers prevent themselves from being relegated to pushing bits on their networks while over-the-top content providers rake in cash by offering value-added services? To make things more complicated, Hesse said the wireless industry was currently suffering a "trust and reputation crisis" and noted that the latest research from the Reputation Institute showed that all three major U.S. wireless carriers ranked in the bottom third in customer reputation among all major U.S. companies. What's more, Hesse said that the companies at the top of the reputation chain were big tech players such as Google, Amazon and Apple, which carriers will have to compete with for value-added wireless services. In Hesse's view, reestablishing trust among customers should be the wireless industry's most important goal over the next few years. "As we look forward as an industry, we need to see trust as our key," he said. "If they trust us they are going to buy from us, they're going to have a special relationship with us." Unsurprisingly, Hesse's remarks on customer trust weren't entirely altruistic since they dovetailed nicely with the new Sprint Guardian security app suite that provides such core functions as malware protection, phishing protection, mobile app scanning and remote wipe capabilities, among other things. In the broader picture, Guardian is part of a charm offensive to help Sprint get its customers more comfortable with relying on it for key services that have traditionally been provided by third parties. Similarly, Sprint has also announced a new advertising policy designed to give users more control over whether they receive ads on their smartphones and tablets. Hesse said that more carriers should embrace such services and initiatives to make their customers feel that their carrier has their back and will take guarding their personal data seriously. Data privacy has become a major issue over the last couple of years, as companies such as Google and Facebook have been engulfed in controversies surrounding how they use their customers' data. "I focus intensely on our reputation because the future of our industry is personalization," he said. "The question is, whom will customers trust to provide these services? The real issue here is who is collecting their information and what are the values that are held by those companies." Kevin McGinnis, Sprint's vice president of product platforms and services, also picked up on Hesse's themes during a private chat with Network World this week. He pointed out that Sprint's Guardian package not only included applications to manage users' smartphone data but also to manage their entire families' mobile security and safety. Among other things, the Guardian family safety bundle gives users the ability to whitelist and blacklist numbers across their family's devices, allows for tracking of family members by sending out certain checkpoints revealing their locations at certain times during the day, and that lets users see whom their children are contacting. "We want to make sure that we're doing the right thing for customers in security, safety and privacy," he said. "It's no longer about carriers and over-the-top players, it's about how we manage these issues together. We want to make sure that we don't stifle things because customer trust starts to wane."

ANALYSIS: Samsung's Galaxy S III: Four things to know Samsung, whose popular Galaxy series of smartphones and tablets have made it the major industry player among Android vendors, sold 86.6 million mobile phones in the first quarter of 2012, a 26% increase from the 68.8 mobile phones that it sold in the first quarter of 2011. What's more, Samsung displaced Nokia for the first time as the top mobile phone vendor in the world as Nokia's mobile phone sales declined from 107.6 million in the first quarter 2011 to 83.2 million in the first quarter of 2012. Gartner said Samsung's dominance among Android vendors is particularly pronounced since no other Android device manufacturer cracks even a 10% share in the global Android smartphone market. On the quarter, Samsung sold around 32.4 million Android-based phones accounting for roughly 37.5% of all its mobile phone sales on the quarter. Gartner also found that Android has further consolidated its position as the world's top mobile operating system over the past year as vendors sold 81 million Android smartphones in the first quarter of 2012, giving Android a 56.1% market share. In the first quarter of 2011, Android was still the top-selling mobile OS in the world but accounted for just 36.4% of all smartphones sold. Gartner reported that Apple's iOS, with a 22.9% of the first quarter 2012 global smartphone market, was the second-most popular mobile OS in the world, followed by the soon-to-be defunct Symbian, which had an 8.6% share. BlackBerry manufacturer Research in Motion continued its steady decline in the global smartphone market in the first quarter of 2012 as its 6.9% market share represented roughly a seven percentage point drop from the 13% market share it had in the first quarter of 2011. Android's growth in the mobile operating system has consistently exceeded expectations, as Gartner two years ago had predicted that Symbian would still be the world's most popular operating system heading into 2012. Although Gartner significantly raised its expectations for Android since then, the firm had still projected that Symbian would be the top mobile operating system in the world in the fourth quarter of 2010. Google first unveiled Android as a Linux-based open-source mobile operating system in late 2007 and it was embraced immediately by carriers Sprint and T-Mobile, with Verizon and AT&T following soon after. Since its debut three years ago, Android has risen rapidly, driven in part by the popularity of devices such as the Samsung Galaxy, the Motorola Droid and the HTC Evo 4G. Google late last year year released the 4.0 ("Ice Cream Sandwich) version of the Android platform that was designed specifically to unify Android across multiple device types and provide Android users with the same experience on both smartphones and tablets.

Brad Reed (Network World) 17 May, 2012 07:33 - - - - print email Distributors Synnex Comments Google today unwrapped the first of its long-promised semantic search capabilities, dubbed Knowledge Graph. The new Knowledge Graph feature will give users more direct answers to questions and the option to search for different connotations of terms with more than one meaning. Or as Google product management director Johanna Wright puts it, "We're in the early phases of moving from being an information engine to becoming a knowledge engine and these enhancements are one step in that direction." Q&A: Why Google is "right to be paranoid" GOOGLE REED-ER: The big question: Does Google really know how to make an Android device better than anyone else? Here are three key features: The information side panel By now we're all familiar with the Google search format: You type in a set of keywords and Google retrieves a simple list that Google's search algorithms have determined are the most relevant to the query. But with Knowledge Graph, when you conduct a search for a well-known person, place or thing, a panel will pop up to the right of the standard search results that will provide additional data on what you're looking for. For instance, a search for "Marie Curie" will deliver a panel that includes the dates of her birth and death, a list of her spouse and children, and her major accomplishments. It also shows you a list of related searches that have been performed by other users that have recently searched for Marie Curie, such as "Pierre Curie," "Albert Einstein" and "Louis Pasteur." Accounting for context Relatively simple words can have wildly different meanings, of course, depending on context. Knowledge Graph will address this by adding a little sidebar on searches that will provide different connotations on words that you search for. As an example, Google uses the term "Taj Mahal," which can refer to a world-famous landmark in India, a popular singer, or a Casino in Atlantic City. So when you type in "Taj Mahal" into Google once it's equipped with Knowledge Graph, you'll get a sidebar giving you the option to search specifically for the different options. In a lot of ways this is fairly similar to how Wikipedia handles terms with more than one meaning, as it provides you with a link at the top of the page giving you the option seeing all the different Wiki pages with titles that contain your search query. Mobile capabilities As you might have guessed, adding a sidebar to mobile searches won't work quite as well on smartphones where there is significantly less screen room to play with. So instead Google has placed a shortened version of the Knowledge Graph just above the main search results so that you have the option to expand on it just by tapping or swiping it. Once expanded, the mobile Knowledge Graph looks much like it does on desktop searches and it provides you with all the basic vital information you'd expect from a standard Knowledge Graph sidebar. Bottom line: Google has long said that it wants its searches to be more personable to users who want more than a standard wall of links. The Knowledge Graph so far looks like an impressive first step and it will be very interesting to see what else Google has up its sleeves in the coming months.

In an 8-K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission today, Motorola said that because China's Ministry of Commerce had cleared the merger over the weekend, "the companies are moving to close the transaction within two business days." ANALYSIS: Google lashes out at patent trolls with Motorola buy BACKGROUND: Google, Motorola officially get hitched The Google-Motorola Mobility merger, which was approved earlier this year by the U.S. Department of Justice, will strengthen Google's smartphone technology patent portfolio and help it more effectively combat lawsuits against Android device manufacturers filed by rivals Apple and Microsoft. In all, Google is paying $12.5 billion to acquire Motorola Mobility and its 24,500 patents. The Motorola buy represents Google's second major attempt to boost its IP portfolio against patent suits. The company also made a bid for patents formerly held by Nortel that was thwarted by an industry consortium that included Microsoft, Apple and Research in Motion and that bid a total of $4.5 billion for the Nortel patents. Google had bid a total of $900 million for the rights to the Nortel patents. In all, the Nortel portfolio contains more than 6,000 patents that cover technologies such as 4G wireless, data networking and voice. While announcing his company's decision to buy Motorola Mobility last year, Google CEO Larry Page said that the deal would help fight off patent suits against Android vendors and would "increase competition by strengthening Google's patent portfolio." Google's Motorola announcement came less than two weeks after the company publicly lashed out at Microsoft, Apple and Oracle for allegedly waging "a hostile, organized campaign against Android ... waged through bogus patents."

The answer is a feature inside of Android O called “Project Treble”, which is supposed to let manufacturers update their phones without having to make a ton of software changes first. Google has essentially split apart its own work on Android from the work that its hardware partners do on Android to make sure it works with their latest chips. If Treble works like Google says it does, companies like Samsung and Motorola will be able to issue Android updates without waiting for a chip partner, like Qualcomm, to first send along software updates. It’s not clear if this removes all hurdles or if manufacturers will still have to update Android’s code to make sure that features specific to their phone are working. But it certainly sounds like one of the most concrete things Google has done to address the problem of Android fragmentation, The Verge says. Google has tried to speed up Android updates in the past without much luck. The company will provide more details about Treble at its I/O conference next week. Related links: The Verge.

Google's "Project Treble" will modularize Android to make updates faster Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/05/12 12:42pm PDTMay 12, 2017 95 Plus 1 on G+ 162 Share on Facebook 76 Share on Twitter Total Shares333 Android O Android OS Development Google News Easily the most annoying aspect of using an Android phone (with the exception of Pixel/Nexus) is slow updates. Android 7.1 (which came out last year) currently sits at 0.5% marketshare, and brand new phones are still being released with 6.0 Marshmallow. Google is aiming to solve this with "Project Treble," which will modularize part of the Android OS to decrease the time OEMs spend updating their devices. If you're not familiar with how Android updates work, here's a summary. Google releases a new Android version, which silicon manufacturers (e.g. Qualcomm, Mediatek) have to supply drivers for. Once that's done, device makers (e.g. Samsung, HTC) can start re-adding all the tweaks they have made to the new Android source code. In the case of carrier-sold phones/tablets, device makers then have to wait for the carriers to approve the update. After all that is done, users finally start to receive the update. Google is hoping to speed up this process with Project Treble, which changes the architecture of Android. Essentially, a new 'Vendor interface' will contain all of the low-level software for a device - like the chipset drivers. Google will work with chipset manufacturers to make sure the Vendor interface is forwards-compatible, and the interface will be validated by a Vendor Test Suite (VTS). The aspect of this news I'm most excited about is that the Vendor interface is forwards-compatible. There have been many cases where chipset manufacturers have not updated drivers for specific popular chips, preventing devices using them from being officially updated to newer Android versions. One example is the Nexus 5 and other Snapdragon 800/801-based devices, which were never officially updated to 7.0 Nougat. It sounds like the Vendor interface will prevent this from happening, or at least prolong the end of support for a given chip. Google says that Android O will be the first version to use the new Vendor interface, and the Android O Developer Preview already has it. Hopefully we'll hear more about Project Treble at Google I/O next week. Source: Android Developers Tags Android android o project treble treble vendor interface vendor test suite vts subscribe ...

Hopefully this means Google can update more core system functions similar to Google Play Services independent of the OEM/carrier path. Mike Updates still have to go through carriers, this just helps prevent devices from early EoL and should make OEMs jobs easier by not having to rewrite every piece of code to work with new drivers. TechGuy22 that's why this is useless. carriers are still involve and OEM like samsung takes time with their own skin destinyhud thats why i buy pixel. also, like mentioned this will reduce the amount of modification needed in android's new version which means slightly early release. even if its 2 weeks early i am good wit it TechGuy22 or or you can push google to make things easier for carriers and OEMs and not bandages i have an S7 edge and a pixel xl. go figure Taco Monster You can't make things easy for someone who doesn't want to do said things. bekifft It's why I buy Pixel too but the whole point of Android was supposed to be freedom and choice. If my only real choices are Google or Apple, I might as well buy a damn iPhone. PI This Daniel Not necessarily. All the OEM has to do is bring their crap (skin) from the last android version. Of course that probably only happen with small android updates (8.1?) Zsolt V Why shouldn't they? By all accounts, they add value so it's worth the wait. CA-Sandra Fuchsia is a very long term project. It's not going to replace Android anytime soon. Dextro I've been saying for ages that Android needs an hardware abstraction in the vein of what Windows has in its driver model. Hopefully this is it and helps get those updates out faster. Sadly I expect that the endless stream of UI customization OEM make will end up killing any kind of benefit this brings. Corbin Davenport I want something like that too, but I'm not deeply familiar with the technical structure of Linux/Android, so I would assume sure there some massive limitation that is keeping that from happening. Dextro I think (but am now 100% sure on this so don't quote me) that Linux historically hasn't had any such abstraction. Drivers are meant to be inside the kernel and compiled for each specific version. That works fine if the code is open source and committed to the kernel repos but it becomes a nightmare for binary blobs. The kernel makes no allowances for stable driver APIs, they will break stuff and won't worry for anything outside of the kernel if I remember correctly. That's probably part of the reason why Android has failed to keep up with Linux kernel versions. keithzg The kernel makes no allowances for stable driver APIs, they will break stuff and won't worry for anything outside of the kernel if I remember correctly. I wouldn't really say this is true. In fact, there is a very stable API provided by the Linux kernel. Hell, one of the most famous Linus rants was about this very topic: It's a bug alright - in the kernel. How long have you been a maintainer? And you *still* haven't learnt the first rule of kernel maintenance? If a change results in user programs breaking, it's a bug in the kernel. We never EVER blame the user programs. How hard can this be to understand? WE DO NOT BREAK USERSPACE! https://lkml.org/lkml/2012/12/23/75 Obviously drivers are trickier, but they're still expected to continue working. The big catch comes in that ARM drivers tend to come as compiled binary blobs. There really isn't an allowance for that in the workflow of things for Linux; good citizens are supposed to provide source, and then new kernel versions and the drivers therefore (often within the kernel itself) are recompiled, and everyone's happy. But while the API remains the same, the ABI does not; drivers compiled as modules for an older kernel won't work on newer ones, even though the drivers would almost certainly work fine if they were recompiled. The ARM space is utterly lousy with proprietary drivers (in no small part this is Qualcomm's fault, although they're far from the only offender). Hence you have Google forever backporting kernel updates to older kernels, so that the ABI remains consistent and older device drivers continue working. Dextro Well, I stand corrected then. But one question then: I was under the impression that drivers were not in userspace but in kernelspace. That's why I didn't even think much of that famous Linus rant. keithzg True, they're (generally; FUSE, for instance, is an area of exception) in kernel space, and that rant isn't entirely applicable because of that, but for practical purposes that just means ABI changes break drivers. And the kernel devs do reserve the right to change the in-kernel API at any point, which could in theory break drivers---it's just that in practice they are rather worried about such breakage and don't wish to do so, and barely break it more than they do userspace. When you think about it, it'd kindof be an insane amount of maintenance if people had to update driver code for new kernel versions! Luckily for "desktop Linux", most drivers these days in the x86 space are open source (NVIDIA is remaining holdout, although even there you can fall back to the Nouveau drivers most of the time), so they're just baked into the kernel or provided as kernel modules, and in practice don't really have to be touched by human hands after they're originally written. Unluckily for Android, that is very much not true in the ARM hardware world. Hell, most Chinese OEMs will just flatly refuse to provide kernel source, even though they're legally obligated to do so. Gaurav Kumar Which is why fuchsia has a stable ABI...like windows. I agree it's not coming anytime soon but it may not be that far away as well.. Lawstorant in the linux world, the answer is DKMS. There's no need for kernel catch-up anymore. I bet Google is doing something similar. Сергей Бугаев Android has the HAL https://source.android.com/devices/#Hardware-Abstraction-Layer -- but it haven't been helping much, as we can see (or would it be much worse without it?). It'd be interesting to see more technical details about Tremble to understand how it's different. Andy J https://developer.android.com/things/index.html pretty much this is what they are aiming for - from the days of Project Brillo. "System updates and support: We provide the system image, updates, fixes, and more, so you can focus on creating compelling products" Brillo/Things is the same idea - there is the low level vendor stuff, the actual OS and then the OEM stuff. Google can update the OS on running devices in the field, without worrying about the vendor stuff or the OEM stuff. Knowledgeborn Allah Exactly... And, unfortunately, this probably isn't going to be anything like Microsoft's new update process for Windows 10 Mobile, which doesn't have to go through carriers. Based on all the software modifications most Android OEMs make with their devices, this probably won't speed up OS updates at all. More powerful devices may last slightly longer, but that will still leave it to the OEMs to support those devices for longer periods, and they likely won't do that anyway, since they're constantly trying to get you to purchase the next one... Zsolt V Windows 10 what? Knowledgeborn Allah Dismissing Windows 10 Mobile (and rightly so) doesn't change the fact that Android needs to learn a few things from them. Their update process, at least right now, is still miles ahead of anything Android is doing. Google should've followed the path that Microsoft already laid when it comes to updating software systems outside of the carriers. It looks like they took one thing that's beneficial but disregarded all the other necessary parts... ¯_(ツ)_/¯ Zsolt V As in how to drop 50% of the devices with the Creators update? No, thanks, Google has nothing to learn from that process. Knowledgeborn Allah Again, you're still missing the point... This isn't about dropping support for any devices with the Creators' update. This is specifically about them bypassing carriers to directly deliver updates to their consumers, which they can sustain for longer periods of time. Google has a lot to learn from that process. Zsolt V Doesn't matter. The end result is the same, the user doesn't get an update. You are missing the point, maybe you don't have one? Knowledgeborn Allah Maybe I don't have one? You sound like an idiot, bud... Maybe you have difficulty reading. I specifically stated in my original post, which you replied to, what the point was: "And, unfortunately, this probably isn't going to be anything like Microsoft's new update process for Windows 10 Mobile, which doesn't have to go through carriers." Again, the point was based on the fact that Windows 10 Mobile updates - regardless of how many people actually have Windows 10 Mobile devices, or how many devices will be discontinued due to the Creators' update - don't have to go through carriers. That's the point. Android as a platform can learn a lot from that. Before making ridiculous replies about a subject and, in effect, making yourself look dumb, maybe you should read the post you're replying to first. Just a thought. PVL_93_RU Windows 10 mobile is dead Knowledgeborn Allah https://www.onmsft.com/news/latest-windows-10-mobile-updates-bypass-carriers-update-phones-directly Say what your want about Windows 10 Mobile when it comes to development, but it's definitely not a good look when a "dead" platform can update their devices better than Android can. 🤦🏾‍♂️ Robabobbob So which windows phone OEM is actually making a modification anything close to what android OEMs do? Knowledgeborn Allah That's not the point... The point is that you can separate core Android OS functions from the themes and launchers inherent in other variations of Android provided by other OEMs. Right now, Android's update process is a disaster. Even after the OEMs push out updates to their devices, it still has to go through various carriers to actually get to consumers, showing that the carriers are actually the ones in charge. Windows 10 doesn't have that problem. iOS doesn't have that problem. Android has that problem. bekifft I agree completely about the HAL, but the real problem remains the network operators retaining strict control over user devices. If AT&T doesn't want to spend the money to add AT&T Navigator, AT&T Device Locator, AT&T Messages, etc etc etc, they will simply not deploy the update. SomeGuy112 This is great, gives the potential for much longer OS update support, especially for Googles own hardware. Hopefully the OG Pixel gets longer than 2 year OS support because of this. destinyhud good point Dn Bro Didn't the article say the new devices with O will have this? DragoCubed The dev preview for the pixel has this project. We can assume it's staying with the pixel MrHanMan So, is it Trebble, or Treble? Jdban Treble according to the google docs Corbin Davenport It is Treble, I can't spell. Fixed. Jeff The trouble with Trebbles... destinyhud i really hope this fixes the 2 week delay in getting major update to nexus devices /s John Doe This is good but Google need to do more. They need to modularize everything in the Android update process. Create a separate carrier update so the baseband can be updated separate from the OS and same to drivers and also OEM skins/Apps. This should have FIVE different updates paths: 1) Core OS/Kernel update path 2) Driver update path 3) Baseband/Carrier related Apps update path 4) OEM Skin/Apps path 5) Security update path This way Google can control the Security, Core OS, Baseband, and Drivers by working with carriers and silicon manufacturers. Also if T-Mobile for example wants to push an update out for the baseband and messaging/phone apps they can do that independent of Google and OEMs. The same goes for Samsung and Qualcomm and others. Latheryin You are confused on one part. What you call skins are not what you think they are. All of the OEM versions of android are completely different distros that replace core OS files and frameworks with their versions. John Doe I know but If Google were to modularize it then it would just be a "skin" or "theme" that is separate from the framework/OS this will give Google control over the main OS and the only way to do that is to not allow OEMs to modify it too much. Latheryin Which would remove all the extra features that devices add on. Many have to be tied into the frameworks and other base OS drivers and libs. There is no separation in it really. And with the way they licensed Android they cant really control a whole lot. Any OEM could easily reverse anything Google does and still release it. John Doe Well yeah of course Google can't do that alone they would have to make new agreements with OEMs and carriers. Most OS skins do not have that many extra features and Google can create APIs to allow OEMs to modify anything they want like if Samsung wants to add an Iris scanner as a password or whatever. The point is OEM "skins" need to become more like launchers in the play store like Nova and Apex and If OEMs want to modify something they would have to ask Google like how Microsoft treats windows. Latheryin You really dont have a great understanding of how things work. That will never hap=p=en. Maybe with Googles second mobile OS they might try to have more control. John Doe How about instead of being an arrogant prick, you tell me what I said is incorrect or what Google cannot do? Why do you think this cannot happen? Microsoft did this with Windows mobile. Like I said, Google would have to sign new licensing agreements with OEMs and Carriers but they probably have to revise it for this Project Treble anyways. Google already uses its Apps and Play store as a bargaining chip to update those agreements. Latheryin Ok first. Google would have to change the license under which android is licensed. Which can't be done. Also have you ever ripped Android apart and had a look? I would guess not as if you had we would not be talking about this. As for what we does does. That really is apples and oranges. Not even close e same thing. The apps and play store are not really that big of a deal. There are hundreds of android devices released every year that don't include them and they sell really well. John Doe You said NOTHING I have not said already. Why Google cannot change the Android license? What stops Google from implementing this since you are the Genius that ripped Android apart and decided this cannot be done? Google already has MADAs in place and they update them every few years with OEMs. Those devices are mostly in China since Google services are banned there. If the Play store is not a big deal then Samsung would have forked Android a long time ago. But go ahead I am still waiting for your "intelligent" replies. Even Amazon's fire phone failed miserably without the play store and Google apps. Latheryin Have you even read the license? Do you really have any idea what happens when something is licensed? Doesn't take that much really. Anyone can look at the code. Heck some of the best android developers are teens. Samsung already did. It's called tizen. Also Samsung is not the end all of devices. They even have a separate store for the devices they run with Android. All Samsung apps don't even hit the Play store. They are Android devices for the common man. Made for everyday people. Ask your favorite developer what device he runs. Look if you want to know more why not dig in, instead of trying to get into a tech conversation when you don't really know too much about it. John Doe Licenses can be updated and their MADAs can be updated which they already do. Samsung did not fork Android, they created a different OS. And that is not turning out very well for them. You still have not told me how what I said cannot be implemented. You should go get one of those Teen Android developers to help you out before you just turn down ideas that you have know nothing about. If Google wanted to they can change Android to how Windows does updates there is nothing stopping them from doing that and OEMs will not fork Android if they did that. I love how you just criticize arguments without providing valid reasons instead of just saying Android does not allow you to do that provide factual reasons or STFU. klaus666 Could this also help to port LineageOS to a smartphone once LineageOS is adapted to this new modular system? jgarrido I dunno, sounds like treble to me... JD OK I get that Google is essentially making what in the Windows World is the HAL and breaking that out of the Kernel and they're essentially creating a lower level API (For lack of a better term) to segment off Android from the OEM mods. However what is actually stopping the OEMs from sayin' fuck this ain't working out let me go in there and refork it anyway. I mean API's are there, now and OEMs should be using that to interact with Android but Android is coming up short so they fork it and custom build the ROM with their own customization and branches. For the longest time the camera stack was a HUGE reason for doing this, even now the Camera2 API is still coming up short, which is why Samsung Completely branches on their own for that too. freshprince_87 Google simply needs to make it mandatory for carriers /OEMS to update their devices and release new phones in the most current version of Android Adnoxaei They could make it a requirement for access to the Play store. Without this interface, that would have been very restrictive. With this interface, customizations can still easily exist, so companies may be more willing to cooperate...espevially if it cuts down on the time needed to test and deploy updates boop By the sound of it, the Vendor Interface is for SoC manufacturers, not device makers. jcopernicus Sweet! Can't wait for my Z3 Compact to get this update! NubCake This doesn't sound like a treble idea at all, hopefully it helps the slow updating process. Knowledgeborn Allah I see what you did there... 🙄😂 ddevito No bass.... Tom Westrick But what if a user is all about that bass? Killa Then they might be in treble if that's all they are about. Sorry, couldn't help myself. :P Emergency Medical Hologram Bassed on what? Martheen Cahya Paulo There's plenty of tweeter surrounding it. Dolby so if we consider the stereo type. Testraindrop While this is certainly a step in the right direction, I somehow doubt that this will change Googles attitude to abandon their own devices after 2 years. Its not like the SOC in the Nexus 5 stopped working when N was installed, in fact its working fine, developed by independent individuals without having "to work with chipset manufacturers", which Google apparently couldn't even achieve. Also the times where google stops updates for the N6 and the Pixels is already set, so even with a chipset blob that is "forwards-compatible" there wont be any further (official) updates. Also if those Vendor APIs will have limits to certain OS aspects like camera, sound etc., then manufacturers will not use them and will just fork again the OS as done currently. saf1927 The custom ROMs that work on Nexus 5 devices don't actually benefit from a lot of things that an officially supported device would. Qualcomm has completely abandoned the chip so from a retail perspective, it's not suitable anymore. Even the "security updates" that these ROMs show in "About phone" aren't actually all implemented, since none of the proprietary blobs and binaries could be updated. Just because a device can be updated with a custom ROM, doesn't mean it's actually running it well. someone755 "Just because it's running it well doesn't mean it's running it well." Welp. saf1927 Wait, what? I can't find that sentence anywhere and I don't remember editing the comment. AbdulB1 Mediatek and in some cases​ Qualcomm (for Nexus 5,sd800,801) don't want people to stay on old phones they try to force them to buy new phones for latest Android version. I am not sure will they be happy about this change? I suspect they will flood market with phones running Android nougat instead. They will try to resist this change by Google. saf1927 Mediatek and Qualcomm aren't device makers, they are silicon manufacturers. AbdulB1 Mediatek charges device makers for new drivers for latest Android versions. Qualcomm stopped supporting sd 800/801 for Android Nougat and thus even sony a device maker who was developing Android N developer versions for a SD800/801 stopped. Chipset makers also have huge clout , it not just sensor makers who decide to support or not their older hardware for newer Android release. saf1927 Well, my point is that none of the silicon manufacturers will force anyone to make only Nougat phones, like you claimed. AbdulB1 "Google will work with chipset manufacturers to make sure the Vendor interface is forwards-compatible, and the interface will be validated by a Vendor Test Suite (VTS)." so if Vendor dont get validated for VTS then do you expect any chances of Android O for those devices? dizel123 I suspect if OEMs want to release new phones with the latest OS version because that's what their users want(I know I'm making assumptions) and Mediatek and Qualcomm try to force them to release phones with Nougat, then Intel will suddenly become a dominant player in the mobile market. This would be exactly the kind of "in" they're praying for. AbdulB1 Intel architecture is quite old , I owned 2 Intel based Android tablets. Intel even didn't bothered to upgrade the OS from 4.0.4 and other one had 5.0 as latest release even it though it was buggy as hell and every hardware vendor went for 5.1 instead. Intel had an edge of running windows along android on their cpu tech. But lack of proper built in modem destroyed their chances in Android world. Their SOCs still had quite high consumption even after releasing newer and newer generations of Mobile SOCs. dizel123 I don't have any inside information, but I'm guessing Intel is working on fixing their problems and making high quality SOCs Cakefish Intel dropped out of the mobile SOC wars. It cancelled development of all upcoming chips last year, I believe. dizel123 Their announcement at this year's Mobile World Congress as well as their current road map on their website both indicate that they're still developing mobile SOCs Cakefish So has it changed since this? -> http://www.anandtech.com/show/10288/intel-broxton-sofia-smartphone-socs-cancelled dizel123 Read my last comment again Lateef Alabi-Oki Jesus! What took them so long? pfmiller I believe there are performance costs to adding hardware abstraction. Google may feel that mobile hardware is finally at a point where it's worth the cost. Justin Martin This was my question. What is it going to do to performance. Not that I'm a Samsung user, but how much will touch wiz suck now? AbdulB1 Will it help in churning out custom ROMs? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I actually want the vendors to work on Android itself, not just their layer. They fix a lot of the bugs that Google leaves in. saf1927 They are already working on that: "In addition to the architectural changes, we're working with our silicon and device partners to take their code changes, such as features for a carrier network in a specific country, and move them into the common Android Open Source Project (AOSP) codebase. For example, Sony and Qualcomm contributed dozens of features and hundreds of bugfixes to Android O so they no longer need to rework these patches with each new release of Android." Simply put, some vendors contribute more than others. Sony is a great example in that regard. They contribute a lot. dizel123 This might just be the best thing Google has ever done to Android Eddie Ringle If you want to see more technical details, here's a bit of what I found back in March when the Developer Preview was released: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13928385 SHunter Orrrrr.... https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/7b191be55920725d6f6aba09c97c1e1942bdfb290cb4cf53e2cb9e23c706626c.png Eumelanin Knight Better late than never. Let's hope Carriers and Manufactures don't have their way and muck this up some how. bekifft At least they're being up front about the problem finally and making it an official "project." It seems like every year the promise is "we're fixing battery this time" and "we're fixing updates." Every year. Never gets better. And with the current FCC and the network operators only set to get worse about their abusive practices, I don't hold out much hope for this plan. What it boils down to is if there is any possible way for network operators (carriers) to meddle with the update, they will. This practice truly aught to be illegal, but see above. Maybe this will at least help lazy to the point of negligence OEMs (Lenovo) not be so appallingly slow. Islam sounds like a joke to me. John C.S. Lock When you finally giving up on Android after 10 long years , here we come iOS ! charfarstar I'll believe when Pixel 2 comes with 4 years of OS updates. MeCampbell30 Turn the treble up in my headphones. Régis Knechtel OMG! I can't believe they're finally doing something about it! https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/5acada086a36a588b7289e5b2a26d7c5f205e0b15a6c77c9b631f1a387dc8d2a.gif Cypher Hey guys and gals, let's add more abstraction to make this slug of an OS even slower! But hey, at least you'll get more frequent updates so that it can get slower more often! xyz People have been telling Google to use their muscle with the chipset makers forever. Qualcomm didn't release drivers is not an acceptable reason to not update Android. Sir_Brizz Hardware manufacturer doesn't release drivers is a perfectly acceptable reason not to update. Consumers should level their hatred at the right target. Blaming Samsung, for example, for Qualcomm's shortcoming won't change Qualcomm's policies. Andy J So last year it was A/B updates from Project Brillo and this year it's the ability to update the OS independently from the low level chipset drivers and the OEM stuff - which is also something Google developed for Project Brillo. While there are no actual Project Brillo / Android Things products in the market yet - it was definitely a worthwhile project for them with these rewards. (Yes I'm aware Chromebooks had A/B updates - but from everything I have heard, they still came about because of Project Brillo, even if Project Brillo wasn't an actual thing when they found their way to Chromebooks) kelpa32 it take google untill android O to try to get updates on time. Urmil Shroff Am I dreaming? Is this really going to happen? PI -This things don't work as u r expecting it ., Google can make guidelines but cant force OEMs to follow it . Oem will still not pass this ,, they will rant about high testing methods and quality benchmarks , ultimately they will pass it for devices only which they want (flagships) only ,, PVL_93_RU This is huge for Android in general. Of course the ideal way of doing things is following ChromeOS model where Google is entirely in charge of managing and updating the software, but then we'd lose out on what makes android unique, which is OEM skins Still though, modular updates are hopefully the next step that will really accelerate how fast devices receive OS updates. Especially mid-range and budget models Patel Nisha I swear I see something like this for every release but yet never happens Paul It's all fine and dandy but I suspect most phone companies still wont upgrade them because they want us to upgrade to newer phones so keeping older phones on older firmwares is in their interest so I don't think much will change. In any event, I'm happy that Google is doing this because it's one less excuse phone companies have to not upgrade their phones, but personally, I think Android could do with something like what Windows does with upgrades so almost any hardware can upgrade to the latest Androids without the manufaturas getting in the way. TonGi018 This is really exciting news! Android Developer Will this also lead to more updates, over a longer period of time ? boop Potentially, as it eliminates the forced EoL when the SoC manufacturer drops support, but it's still up to OEM and Carriers to develop and distribute updated. Android Developer Maybe for Google Pixel , at least? Maybe more than 2 years of updates?

In the last couple of days, Google pushed some changes to the Maps interface that add street view images to the directions screen. It seems there's also another change showing up on more recent versions that will also move around a few widgets on the screen. When you begin planning a route between two places, the directions screen will now show thumbnails from Street View with every turn in the list Tapping on the image will open up Street View's full 360-degree viewer and direct it to the location of the turn. In the couple of tests I've done with it, Street View seems to also be oriented correctly for the view you'll have as you are driving – meaning it won't point you at the wrong side of the road. As a bit of trivia, Google first introduced this feature to the Maps web interface right around this time of year back in 2008. There's even a video introducing it. Left: Older example. Right: New example. The other notable change is more widespread throughout the interface, but it's a mostly cosmetic adjustment. Many screens now include a bottom bar with contextual activities, often accompanied by a button on the right side. It takes up more space, but it functionally replaces the FAB (Floating Action Button) on many screens, or at least one of the FABs. This design may remove some confusion for users that don't immediately recognize the icons, but it may take a little longer since some users will have to read more. This is probably an experiment, but Google may eventually add this type of bottom bar to the Material Design Guidelines. These changes appear to have been activated remotely, so it's possible some users saw these much earlier as part of a test, while others may still see the older interface for a while. Street View thumbnails are showing up on versions of Maps going back at least as far as v9.51.1, the bottom bar seems to be limited to v9.52.0 and later.

Useful stuff added every few weeks of great quality and a ton of Easter eggs too. Wish Google would clone them for every project Deeco I assume, it's because literally everyone relies on Google Maps with biggest user base. fjleon there was a time a few years ago that Maps sucked, they were removing features such as offline maps. glad to see it improving this time around mike shwilly But how many more years will pass until they make buildings visible during navigation?

Cody Toombs Thanks for reaching out. I don't personally watch the tips address (well, very rarely I glance at it) and your email must have been missed. David Slawotsky Thanks for replying. So where should I send tips next time? Cody Toombs The tips address is still the best place. Things usually don't get lost in there, but it can happen, especially if there's a lot happening that day. Computator I have sent in several tips before and they have seemingly been lost or ignored as well. They were all things I would have thought would be fairly important. I don't send small trivial things or whatever. For example, iirc I sent in a tip about Google photos adding support for raw photos several weeks before AP had an article about it. I also pointed out several major details about how it worked that were left out of the article and that AP seemed unaware of. Ahmad El-Ibrahim David Ruddock also has his Twitter DM open for tips, but only if needed. I'm sure if any spamming​ or annoyance will get someone blocked. Manard Yeah, I've had it for a while too.

It's the primary action! Why move it to the bottom when all the functionality is unchanged? I feel like Googlers are trying to give themselves work to do at times, especially when they act askew to their own design guidelines. catalysto I think the standard for the FAB was that there should only be one, so they were already breaking their own rules by having the double FAB. I agree though that if you are looking at a location, the FAB should change to directions. Willie Chalmers III It's in smaller text, but multiple FABs are allowed if they both serve important purposes: https://material.io/guidelines/components/buttons-floating-action-button.html#buttons-floating-action-button-transitions Manard Heh, the Play Store icon for the APK link is out of date...

Google Contacts 2.0 includes a cleaner UI and changes to contact management [APK Download] Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/05/11 1:53pm PDTMay 11, 2017 72 Plus 1 on G+ 153 Share on Facebook 117 Share on Twitter Total Shares342 Applications Downloads Google News The Google Contacts application really hasn't changed much over the years - after all, it just has to store contacts. Last year the app was updated with a hamburger menu and the ability to merge duplicates. Now Google has released version 2.0 of the Contacts app, with more design improvements and changes to how contacts are sorted. New design Contacts 2.0 has several minor interface tweaks all over the place, which address a few gripes I (and likely some of you) have had with the application. The actual list of contacts looks the same, but the slide-out menu now features an account switcher.    Left: Contacts 1.6; Center, Right: Contacts 2.0 Previously, the app would show all contacts from all your synced Google accounts together. Now you can easily keep contacts separate, or still combine all of them if you want. Another noticeable change is on the contacts themselves - the user icon has been reduced to a small circle instead of covering the top half of the screen.   Left: Contacts 1.6; Right: Contacts 2.0 There are a few other changes on the contact pages. The menu has removed the option to link a contact, but it has a new 'Move' item that moves contacts to another Google account. The edit button has also been moved to a floating action button. Other changes Moving on to the app settings, you can now choose which accounts to use when exporting contacts. Contacts 2.0 also supports Android O's notification channels, with a single channel called 'Notifications' (really helpful name, I know).   A quick look at the APK code reveals that this channel is used for export status notifications. I'm not really sure what the point of implementing Notification Channel support is if your app only has one kind of notification, but props to the Contacts team for getting a head start on Android O support. Finally, there is a new splash screen when you open Contacts for the first time: It basically just tells you that the app will automatically back up your contacts, which might not have been immediately obvious to people using Android for the first time. APK Download The APK is signed by Google and upgrades your existing app. The cryptographic signature guarantees that the file is safe to install and was not tampered with in any way. Rather than wait for Google to push this download to your devices, which can take days, download and install it just like any other APK.

Grey Corbin, please. You have to rip Google for this. It's inexcusable. Someone needs to put pressure on the company for their ridiculous UI beliefs. Wasted space galore, circular images for the sake of circular images. This is the peak of their insanity. We used to rip Google for their UI issues all the time. Now they are trying, but that doesn't mean we no longer criticize them. Look at this! I still remember the Nexus 4 announcement, when they introduced this version of Contacts. They praised the big, beautiful, high-res images, and the fact that the new camera could capture them. Now it's five years later and we've gone in the complete opposite direction? Please, someone at AP step up to the plate. Filipe Santos Yup, the overall changes are very good but that wasting space is so bad.... They try at least like Corbin said morteum Why are these tiny contact pictures becoming a thing? Filipe Santos People are starting to use glasses 😂😂 Jimk4003 I think it's because a lot of contact photos are low Res images synced of social media that look awful when blown up to fill half a screen. A smaller photo might not be as dramatic, but at least it isn't a pixelated mess. At least, I assume that's the thinking behind it. Corbin Davenport Yeah, blurry contact photos were a constant problem with the old design. Though, a tiny icon that takes up almost as much space isn't much better. Mochen Liu But you can change a high res photo yourself if you cam't stand it... I have high res photos for most of my contacts. Grey Blurry contact photos are only a problem if you don't care about your contact photos. And if you don't care about them, then you aren't interested in fixes. Savage Alien I remember some of this being Google's fault. A while back, before the whole Material Design era, There was inconsistent syncing between web and mobile and somehow resulted in low res version of the images being synced even when you used high res images since the servers would keep low res copies for thumb nails and things. tismondo Has this problem been fixed? It definitely happened to me - I stopped bothering managing my contact photos because I got tired of blurry versions syncing across every time I replace my phone or flash a ROM. Sashank Narayan Yes, it has since been fixed. I haven't had the issue in a few years now. Elizabethmgamble Google is paying 97$ per hour!

Maxr1998 Well, you can of course just click the image to expand it to fullscreen, right? Right?! - Oh nevermind, it's Google, how could I forget. sigh.. EDIT: OH MY GOD, YOU ACTUALLY CAN! catalysto Actually, you can do exactly that. Maxr1998 Yeah, just found out myself. Everything ok then 😜 Willie Chalmers III At least Google followed their material design guidelines in the original layout. The newer layout is a true waste of space. PixelXLellence ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ +1 for cute doggie pic. http://livewallpaper.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/cute-dog-wallpaper12.jpg JacobTheDev I honestly prefer the old one, never had an issue with "wasted space." It's not really wasted, it's a design decision, and I think it's effective in that it treats the contact as a person and not just a bunch of random data; it helped to identify who's contact information you where looking at. I hope this doesn't affect how phone calls come in... Chris Wachtman I really prefer the old design on the left. I set decent photos for my frequent contacts, and I enjoy seeing them prominently displayed. Anyone else use the Contact homescreen widget? Alfredo Hernández Exactly, it would suck big time if they gave the Phone app the same treatment. incognito27 I wouldn't call the left one a waste of space. It actually looks nice. There is nothing wrong with it. The right one though. Ooohooo. The circular icon seems pointless. Winston This is why I like Samsung's Contacts app. It displays a tiny circle like the version 2.0 one if the image is low res, but displays a half-height full-res image like the earlier build if it has an HD one. Which you can swipe down to view in its entirety. Fruity101079 Seriously, this is so stupid. Why selling big screen phones if it's to have ridiculous tiny pictures!!?? If people have blurry pictures, that's their problems. A lot of us took time to use "high res" pictures for all our contacts. And we have to deal with people who doesn't care.... >:( F4LL0U7 I was hoping the Contacts app would bring in the recently-removed feature from Google+ that allows you to keep your contacts up to date, using your contacts' linked Google accounts and downloading that info into your own Contacts app. Since they removed that feature from G+, when I got a new phone I had to download an old version of G+, sync contacts, and then update G+. Another gripe I have about Contacts: every time I reset my phone, the contacts that I previously merged (before resetting) become unmerged and I have to do it all over again. Michael Tran I think it just pulls automatically now. I added a new contact and entered in their gmail and it pulled the photo automatically. The option is gone from G+ but it still did it anyway. F4LL0U7 Pulling the photo always worked, but linking with G+ pulled in all other info, like address, phone, etc. as well. Michael Tran Ah okay. I understand now. cadtek91 This also took away the ability for the phone to download your own photo for the User account photo in the quicksettings drawer. Savage Alien I've never liked having a blank user picture, and each time I wiped my phone I'd be frustrated having to remember how to get mine to show up. Always surprised this was a feature "buried" in Google+.... and now it's gone? No other way to have your google photo to show up? F4LL0U7 Can you believe that?! The only other way is to manually select a photo yourself. There doesn't seem to be any other way to pull in your Google profile pic, other than installing an old version of G+. Disqusman Yup...only realised that yesterday when I reset my Nexus 6P. Sux. I manually set a photo...but I may download an older version of G+ to get all the contacts to sync. cadtek91 Not that I know of. You could manually add the same photo but eh. F4LL0U7 I hate that! That's the main reason why I grabbed an old version of G+, so I could have my profile pic show up. Phil Worst decision ever. I see I'm not the only one who keeps an old Version of G+ around for that exactly. Downloads at APK Mirror must have gone up quite a lot :D F4LL0U7 I should probably do that too. Now that I think of it, I have no idea which version I download. Which version is it? Tiuri Elvander If you add a picture to your Allo profile, this picture shows up in the quick settings drawer. cadtek91 I have an Allo picture, but still no user picture. YouNex Merging contacts has always been a mess, it never syncs properly. Just copy any additional details and remove the other doublons, keep only 1 per each contact. It's manual but more fail-proof Ben Godfrey This used to bug me too. I think if you merge contacts via the new web interface (the pretty material design one, not the old Gmail-looking one), it will sync the changes across everything. It's been a while since I've had to merge duplicates, though -- somebody let me know if this is incorrect. F4LL0U7 Cool thanks, I'll try that! Carson Saldanha Finally none of those low-res, blown up contact pictures. Savage Alien Haven't had that issue in years. Carson Saldanha It's mainly with those people who use low-res pics for their Google account. Savage Alien I'd take fuzzy photo over this new design. I have maybe one low res contact photo and I picked it myself for nostalgia reasons. Cameras on phones are only getting better, too, so this isn't a great excuse to use going forward... (and even much older phone would likely take passable photos) Luzandro Haven't seen this for a long time, but even if this is a real problem for some people, there are better ways to solve it. For example I've seen a dialer/contacts app (don't recall the name) where some sort of dots effect was applied to low res images, which made them look quite nice actually roberto.elena Can the contact names still be edited using multiple fields like name prefix, first name, middle name, etc. or is it all one field now like in the new web version? Tiuri Elvander Customising which groups show up doesn't work for me. People from other groups are still shown in the list. Martins Nkem Looks like the Samsung contact app.. Good job Google Kurt Gomez Can't link contacts across accounts anymore Mochen Liu I love the yuge portrait design... why google? why?... Savage Alien Terrible design. Haven't updated my Phone Dialer app either because they made the same change to it months ago. Bewear It's... ugly. Tim Harman Can you pick which photo to use from the multiples available in a merged account? It annoys me no end I can't pick the really lovely photo of my wife, instead of just the lovely one Google picked. It used to be a feature, then it went away somewhere. Trevor Hawk They also removed the ability to customize which contacts to display in settings Corbin Davenport Are you sure? It's still there for me. Trevor Hawk Yep. It's gone for me. https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B6dKMVDga-L9MkwxZGJDUVJBLW8 Alfredo Hernández Damn, that's weird. I definitely still have it on mine. Tiuri Elvander In your first screenshot there an option "contact to display". Surely that's what you want??? Trevor Hawk Thats a screen shot of the older version Tiuri Elvander Ah, my bad. That's very weird. 2 Men-E I much prefer the large contact picture... whispy_snippet Same. Disqusman Agree 100% YouNex Whiter =/= cleaner, this isn't some sort of effing clothes King_Android This might the first time ever I will wait for an update to be forced upon me with a Google app. 😱 jcopernicus I can honestly say the contact portraits are great use of space. Not some soul less list of information. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/a4a682a8e0c801948117beab20317cc0df2b2d6bac2c85d9ac535412608edc9f.png Ygor Cortes The new contact page with the ridiculously small picture looks disgusting. The old one was much better. Oh Google... Ygor Cortes I'm glad that I don't use Google Contacts anymore for a while now! Timothy Bracken It looks like your blocked numbers are now part of the contacts app. Does this mean that blocked numbers are now backed up and restorable? I can't test this since I don't have a 2nd device. Grey Does Contacts have a Personal Profile yet that is stored on the web? How does Google not have that in 2017? Corbin Davenport It does if you go to settings and tap 'Your info.' Grey That's a local profile. It's not available on the web. In the Gmail app, when I ask it to add my email to contacts, it can't see my "Your Info", and it instead looks for a contact entry. It doesn't exist. Android is 8 years old and does not have this option. Tiuri Elvander Your Google+ profile??? Winston Being a Google app, I'm surprised it's not already on version 89.7 JG I have a cross-platform upgrade that involves Contacts I'd love to see Google make... Google made a comment about their commitment to helping improve online security [probably in an article talking about their use of HTTPS helping to encrypt the majority of web traffic]. I'd like to see them step this commitment up. They're working on a key server that's supposedly more focused on linking the key to a particular profile (to ensure the key belongs to the person claiming its theirs). I'd like to see Google launch the service. Create a new app that allows us to either create a new key or upload an existing key. Update Contacts to link to the key server database and automatically pair contacts with their corresponding public keys (if a match exists). Update Android Messages, Hangouts, Allo, GMail, et al to automatically encrypt any outgoing messages to contacts with public keys. Then even non-technical people can begin using encrypted messages. All it'd take is to download an app, tap a button or two and bam. Disqusman My God! Who made that decision to go with the tiny circular image?! The large contact picture is so much more beautiful. I really dislike how they changed the UI in the dialer to the small contact picture as well :/ ast00 The new contact page with the tiny picture and lots of wasted space is a step back. Shailesh Kumar Is it only exclusive to pixel devices? How can I have this on my moto x style? Daan Smit Guys, I am just not able to display contacts from a number of Google contact groups and my outlook contacts. I can only see my outlook contacts if I either opt for viewing all candidates or only outlook contacts. This also happens on the standard OnePlus3t contacts app. It used to work on Marshmallow though. Is this an Android issue? Exalm It seems they're getting rid of cards and shadows everywhere in favor of simple lists.Flat notifications and quick settings (Nougat), flat dialing screen, flat app drawer in Pixel Launcher, flat Play Store My Apps screen, and now flat contact page. What next? :) Cakefish I'm planning to replace my Galaxy S7 with the Pixel 2 this year because I usually prefer Google's UI, but in this case I actually prefer Samsung's contact app UI: https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/55ecc6c4c968731fab76e21b370c08aeaf4c2fce79c88314a96bbbf54656503b.png Alex Rusinov How do you link / merge contacts now? Selecting multiple contacts doesn't provide an option to merge only to share. Also I can't find "link" feature anywhere, only "unlink" Zachary Dunn Cleaner? You mean they got rid of the colorful highlights and made it into another white/gray bland app. They could have scaled down the image a bit to take less space. But a full hero image looks much better than a huge gray space with a tiny avatar iamakii I'm liking this cleaner look and interface Nick Felker Regarding notification channels, they will be required in Android O for all apps before a notification can be presented. So expect to see other apps follow suit.

Weather Your 4-day local weather forecast Sunday May 14, 2017 News Local News Larger / SmallerNight Mode Mother's Day rip-off warning: How online florists can short-change customers Cara Waters 13 May 2017, 3:55 p.m. Spot the difference: Lily's Florist in Wollongong and Lily's Florist Parramatta. Spot the difference: Lily's Florist in Wollongong and Lily's Florist Parramatta. Photo: Supplied Mother's Day is the most popular day of the year for buying flowers but florists are warning of the "devastating" impact of online order gatherer florists. Local florists say customers may be left short-changed with flowers that are drooping, late or damaged while they are left dealing with the fallout. Rita Sakr was forced to move her florist business into her garage when payments from online company Ready Flowers stopped. Order gatherer florists are websites which gather orders from the internet. The florists are not attached to a physical, bricks-and-mortar flower shop or warehouse; instead their businesses are built on websites visible in every Australian suburb through online search listing. A search for Lily's Florist in Nowra leads to an underpass. Photo: Supplied After a customer orders online the order gatherer florists pass it on to a local florist after deducting a percentage of the order without ever advising consumers there is a middle-man involved. "The effect on florists is devastating," says Charles Lukasik, florist and owner of Floral Expressions in Northmead and founder of the Australian Florists Network. "Our industry is getting a bad reputation as consumers are paying order gatherers for flowers worth a certain amount, but when they get delivered they are only worth a fraction of the price. Last Mother's Day lots of florists refused to make up orders for order gatherers resulting in a lot of unhappy customers who paid for their orders on line, but they were never delivered." Charles Lukasik, owner of Floral Expressions says order gatherer florists are "devastating" for the industry. Photo: Nick Moir Deceptive local advertising Lukasik says some order gatherer florists engage in deceptive local advertising. "Order gatherers spend thousands of dollars with Google to be seen as the local florist in all suburbs," he says. "They appear in every suburb in Australia, claiming to be located in that suburb." Order gatherer florist Lily's Florist appears through its targeted advertising to be a local florist – however the business is online only and does not have physical stores or warehouses. In a 2012 interview with payment provider E-Way Andrew Thomson, co-founder and chief executive of Lily's Florists, detailed how the business captures online flower orders through over 30 major city-specific websites across Australia, 200 micro-sites for the smaller towns and suburbs across Australia for customers searching on Google and over 150 feeder websites that forward potential customers to the national Lily's Florist website. False address claims Lukasik says other order gatherer florists falsely claim to be located at physical street addresses on their websites. "[It is] to reinforce their claims that they are a local, bricks-and-mortar establishment," he says. For example, Lily's Florist claims to have a store at 32-60 East street in Nowra New South Wales but a Google search of this location shows it is an underpass. Thomson says Lily's Florist has advised Google that this is not the business' listing. "Sometimes Google will attach a URL to an incorrect address, as they have with the Lily's Florist Nowra listing," he says. "Obviously we do not have a member florist under a bypass. Google relies heavily on user input with these listings." Left side shows a bunch of flowers ordered by a consumer for $124.95 and on the right is the price paid to the florist of $57.87. Photo: Supplied Chunky commissions Order gatherer florists often deduct a hefty commission leaving consumer with a small bunch of flowers after spending up big. The Australian Florists Network says commissions range from between 21 per cent and 55 per cent and leave both consumers and local florists short changed. Sometimes the commission can be even more, Annie Lok the owner of South City Florist in Wagga Wagga received an order from order gatherer Ready Flowers for a dozen long stem red roses which were sold to the consumer at $124.95 reduced from $178.50. The order was sent to Lok for $57.85, a commission of 67 per cent by the order gatherer. Ready Flowers has been the subject of ongoing customer complaints and an investigation by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. The order gatherer florist collapsed into administration last month owing local florists more than $188,000. Lok says order gatherers Ready Flowers and Z Flowers use an auction system where the order is offered to a range of local florists for the suggested price of $57.85. The local florists then bid to win the work. "Most of the time I ask for more money because the prices are ridiculous," Lok says. "You wouldn't make any money. You lose your labour you lose everything. I think it is very desperate that florists will do it." Z Flowers failed to respond to a request for comment. A Ready Flowers complaint. Photo: Supplied Disgruntled customers Lok is concerned about the impact on customers. "At the end of the day the customer will receive something that is not good at all," Lok says. "It is not possible to deliver to the original price. It's a big problem because the customer will never receive the value they expect because [the order gatherer florists] go for the lowest price." Customer reviews on sites such as Product Review echo Lok's concerns. Many of the order gatherer sites attract very mixed reviews with Fast Flower's customer "Richo" complaining "Very disappointing display of flowers the roses were drooping when delivered they were all dead within 2 days will never use or recommend your business to anyone". Fast Flowers failed to respond to a request for comment however did offer a refund to the customer. Florist's choice Thomson defends the practice of order gathering on the basis that local florists choose to participate. "With our system, they can reject orders if they can't or don't want to do them and they can always withdraw from the membership at any time," he says. Thomson says the commission charged by Lily's Florist varies and he will not disclose the percentage. "Our fees are such that the florist can still make the order to value so the customer is receiving the product at full value and the florist is still profiting," he says. "Otherwise – the florist would not accept our order and we would never have repeat customers as we do." Impact on the industry The Australian Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman has been dealing with complaints about order gatherers. "The ASBFEO is aware of this issue and has investigated complaints on behalf of florists who have not be paid for supplying flowers through online florist operations, which have been referred to as 'order gatherers'," a spokesperson for the ombudsman says. "The complaints from bricks-and-mortar florists result from being left out of pocket after supplying flowers ordered by 'order gatherers' who have failed to pay them for their services." Brendan Dodwell, owner of North Side Flower Market in Brisbane, says local florists are struggling to compete against the sheer size and resources of order gatherer florists. "A small individual florist has nowhere near the resources to compete against a business that has millions of dollars to spend on online advertising that says we are an online business in your suburb." Dodwell says customers can avoid order gatherers by supporting local florists. "If you are interested in a local florist look at their website for a physical address," he says. "Look at the reviews and their social media and Facebook page."    Follow MySmallBusiness on Twitter, Facebook and LinkedIn.

Speculations have it, Google will release its next Pixel smartphone around the month of October and it will be known as the Google Pixel 2. While there is still some odd 5 months left for the rumored launch, well-known concept phone designer Concept Creator has posted a teaser on YouTube revealing how the Pixel 2 might look like. Of course, this is just a concept video which doesn't hold much weight, but you might want to take a look. As you can see, the upcoming device would be bigger in size than the previous Pixel phones. So it is being presumed that the Google Pixel 2 will pack a large battery under its hood. It has improved quite a lot on the design aspect as well. Also Read: Sansui Horizon 2 with 4G VoLTE launched at Rs. 4,999; sale debuts on May 15 via Flipkart Although the video is not that clear, we can still manage to notice a vertically arranged dual camera setup on the back of the phone. Well, it doesn't come as much of a surprise to me. Most of the large manufacturers are incorporating dual cameras on their smartphones. So Google might just do the same if it wants to follow the current trend. Interestingly, the front of the device also appears to bear dual cameras. However, it is unlikely that the Google Pixel 2 will be a quad camera phone. What's more, there is a fingerprint sensor on the back of the smartphone under the camera module. Display-wise, it seems to sport a bezel-less display, which gives it a premium look. In any case, the actual Google Pixel 2 might turn out to be completely different in terms of design and features. We just have to wait and watch until the official launch.

This state of affairs raises an awkward question: if bounty hunters can identify flaws then why can't the major software developers that write the software in the first place? Shouldn't the well-paid in-house teams be able to spot the flaws either before launch or during testing? "A company such as Google does have a huge team working on security – it has tons of people looking for vulnerabilities," said Adam Bacchus, chief bounty officer at HackerOne, which acts as a go-between for companies and hackers for a 20% commission of the prizes paid for spotting bugs. "But there are tons of features being pushed out in tons of different products, plus there are acquisitions all the time, so things will slip through the cracks." According to Bacchus, when tech firms set up reward schemes, "they're not saying 'our security isn't good enough'; they're saying 'can I have a safety net?'" The need for help, often from self-taught hackers, has seen Adobe, Apple, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Tesla, Yahoo and government departments set up programmes that invite people to hack their systems in return for rewards, with top-performers netting more than $350,000 a year. The schemes are a far cry from the not-too-distant days when firms took hackers to court over breaches, even when they were trying to report the vulnerability to the company involved. It's a mutually beneficial truce. "It provides them [the white hats] with the assurance that the company won't pursue legal action against them if they report a vulnerability in an online service," said Katie Moussouris, CEO and founder of Luta Security, a firm that helps companies and governments work with hackers on security bounty programmes. "In most countries it's illegal to hack a system, so bug bounty programmes provide useful parameters for researchers to know that if they look for a bug and report it then they'll be free from legal action and repercussions. We have hackers from around the world; it's a way for them to support families or [help] students graduate without debt – it's a legitimate occupation." Outside the system Research from HackerOne shows that three-quarters of the hackers working on reward programmes are self-taught, whereas tech companies often hire graduates from top universities – all emerging with similar skillsets and attributes. The graduates might fit the corporate culture, but could be blind to issues that aren't taught in academia. "There's a huge difference between formal computer science education and actually knowing what you're talking about when it comes to security," said Moussouris. "Computer security is a new discipline. Most universities aren't teaching computer security, they're teaching functional computing – computer programming, but not all the security techniques and methodologies." Moussouris helped the US Department of Defense launch its "Hack the Pentagon" programme, and said there are few universities in the world that have staff qualified to teach security. "A formally educated computer scientist often comes out of university with zero clue about writing secure code, and that's why we see the same mistakes made over and over again," she said. Motivation gap There are other reasons why the software firms struggle to eliminate vulnerabilities, even those that have been identified internally or by third parties. The more secure a product, the less it will work with other applications. Take, for example, the work of Canadian startup Copperhead, which has released a hardened version of Android. The company claims it enables quicker patching, with added protection from a hardened kernel, libraries and compilers. Security experts say it's a big deal, especially given the numerous problems with Android's general security. It seems strange that Google doesn't buy the technology or add elements to its version of Android. However, security comes at a price, which might be too high in terms of performance, interoperability and data sharing. Google, for example, would receive limited benefit from hardening the Android OS, and might see consumer frustration rise. "There is a general perception that security implies a performance overhead (memory, energy, processing power) so Android may have decided that, for most users, this overhead is unnecessary," said Chris Hankin, director of the Institute for Security Science and Technology at Imperial College London. Upgrades and refresh rates mean users are often on different versions of an operating system, making this even more complicated. "Often the most advanced platform protections require a bit of re-architecture of an operating system," said Moussouris. "Third parties can often offer stronger security solutions in the short term, because making architectural changes too quickly in the main codebase may break the most commonly installed applications, rendering the most secure solution into the most difficult solution to deploy in the real world." Moussouris claims that, during a programme she organised for Microsoft in 2012, security enhancements were balanced against other criteria. For example, prototypes needed low overheads, with a CPU and memory cost of no more than 5%, and must not have any application compatibility or usability regressions. "There are great ideas out there, but only the solutions that struck a balance between security and usability could make it into the official codebase." Greater security is also at odds with the business models of many of the biggest platforms – it would impede sharing and connectivity. Even if a company such as Copperhead makes a locked-down version of Android, Facebook or Twitter, those companies may not take it into the codebase because such a move would threaten earnings. "Above all, Google wants to collect all end-users' data for exploiting and social graphing - and the same goes for Facebook," said Nicolas Diaz, a consultant with the YesWeHack bug bounty platform. "Smartphones are connected devices and are doomed to vulnerabilities due to wireless features that are basically open to attack." Google, Facebook and Microsoft all declined to comment on this story.

Liliputing LPX Show Mini PCs Reviews Deals Shop About Contact us Advertise on Liliputing About Liliputing Privacy Statement Google’s Project Treble makes Android updates easier for phone makers… starting with Android O 05/12/2017 at 3:17 PM by Brad Linder 4 Comments When Apple releases a new version of iOS, it rolls out to millions of iPhones and iPads almost immediately. When Google releases a new version of Android, it’s a crap shoot to figure out whether you’ll ever get it at all, unless you’re using a Nexus or Pixel device. That’s because after Google releases a new version of Android, chip makers, phone and tablet companies, and wireless carriers all have a role to play before the update makes it to your phone… if it ever does. Now Google has unveiled Project Treble: a new architecture for Android that should make it easier for device makers to push Android updates to users quickly. In a nutshell, Project Treble separates the Android OS framework from the Vendor implementation. Chip designers and device makers can use a new vendor Test Suite to ensure that their software meets Google’s standards, and when a new version of Android is released, the device maker doesn’t need to change the custom code at all. All that changes is the Android OS framework. Google is also working with hardware companies including Sony and Qualcomm to integrate code changes into the Android Open Source project, which should make it easier, for example, to ensure that phones will retain compatibility with specific wireless networks after an update. A side benefit? Custom ROM builders will also get access to that code.   While Project Treble provides tools that could encourage device makers to update more quickly (and more often), there are no guarantees. It’s still going to be up to third-parties to determine if and when to push updates. Just because Google is making things easier on them doesn’t mean they’ll do it. It’s also worth noting that Google only promises Project Treble will be available on “new devices launched with Android O and beyond.” In other words, current phones need not apply… well, mostly. Google does point out that Pixel phones using the Android O Developer Preview are already using the new Project Treble architecture. But it’s unlikely that any other current phone will support the feature. So unless you have a Pixel or Pixel XL, Project Treble is something that might affect you in the future… but not the present. With Android O set to launch later this year, I wouldn’t expect to see Project Treble widely integrated into non-Pixel phones until this fall, or maybe early 2018. After all, Android 7.0 was released last August, but there are still some device makers shipping phones and tablets with Android 6.0 or earlier.

As you can see from the above GIF, the new option scans your selfie then automatically builds a sticker pack based on your image. It’s like the next level of Bitmoji (which is now owned by Snap Inc.) – through Bitmoji, you create your avatar manually, but Google’s version does all the creation work for you, based on your image, which could prove a fun addition and get more people checking out what they look like in Allo-animated form.   But then again, that approach is somewhat risky – for example, people might not like the emphasis the system puts on certain aspects of their features. To ensure they’re covering for this as best they can, Google says they’ve worked with an artistic team to create illustrations representative of a wide variety of features – in fact, Google says the system has the capacity to come up with “more than 563 quadrillion combinations”. But to be safe, there’s also a set of customization tools to further enhance and refine your animated avatar if you need. It’s another attempt to put a Snapchat-like spin on their messaging tool – underlining that Snapchat influence, Google notes that they’re working on additional animations and options for their new selfie app: “Allo team is working with a range of artistic voices to help others extend their own voice. This first style that launched today speaks to your sarcastic side but the next pack might be more cute for those sincere moments. Then after that, maybe they’ll turn you into a dog.” Turning people into dogs seems like a pretty direct reference to Snapchat – on one hand, Evan Spiegel and Co have to be flattered that their innovations have the attention of two of the biggest tech companies in the world. On the other, that means they’re now competing against two of the biggest tech companies in the world, which may not be the ideal situation to grow within. At the same time, it’s difficult to know what, exactly, Google’s doing with their Allo messaging app – is this a real push to make messaging a significant part of their business, or is it just a testing ground for their photo and messaging tools? It seems more likely that Allo is a means to keep up with the Facebook’s and Snapchat’s of the world, should Google ever need to put more emphasis on such tools. Google’s obviously well-aware that messaging is on the rise, and if messaging does become an all-encompassing, multi-purpose communications channel, like Facebook hopes it will, that could, eventually, see Google lose ground in search, as more people conduct more discovery-type activity within messaging apps. Allo appears to be their way to stay connected on this front – not yet a key point of emphasis, but maybe, if they can start to push it as a more viable option than other messaging tools, or if messaging growth accelerates, it could become a more critical element. In this respect, adding in innovative visual tools like this will be key in connecting with that younger user market.   Google launched Allo back in September, and aside from cool selfie-animations, it also has a range of helpful tools, like smart replies, which can suggest on-tap responses based on your common answers, and even image recognition. Allo also includes Google Assistant, an immediate, and always available connection to Google search within your message threads, which obviously has significant potential benefits. It’ll take some pretty significant innovations to get users to switch across from their current messaging apps and over to Google Allo, though having it pre-installed on Pixel phones will no doubt help (Google has reportedly shipped around a million Pixels thus far, so not a huge influence as yet).    From a marketing perspective, the addition of Google Assistant, in itself, will be a relevant consideration if the app sees significant take-up (optimizing for assistant search), but there could also be further implications and opportunities if Google gives Allo more attention.  If you’re interested in checking it out, Allo is available for both Android and iOS.  Author Information Andrew Hutchinson @adhutchinson Sign up for the Social Media Today newsletter You'll get a daily email with the latest news, lessons, and insights on: Social Media Marketing Digital Strategy and more Yes, I'd like to receive Marketing Dive's daily newsletter as well.

Since time immemorial, the Android ecosystem has made quickly updating an operating system across devices seem like an impossible task. Google releases a new version of Android, and while Nexus and Pixel devices get updated, other Android OEMs mostly shrug their shoulders and go about their business. If users are lucky, they might get an OS update six months down the line, at which point Google has already moved on to an even newer version of Android. Ahead of Google I/O, Google has just dropped a bombshell of a blog post that promises, for real this time, that it is finally doing something about Android's update problems. "Project Treble" is a plan to modularize the Android OS, separating the OS framework code from "vendor specific" hardware code. In theory, this change would allow for a new Android update to be flashed on a device without any involvement from the silicon vendor. Google calls it "the biggest change to the low-level system architecture of Android to date," and it's already live on the Google Pixel's Android O Developer Preview. This is not a magic bullet that will solve all of Android's update problems, however. After an update is released, Google lists three steps to creating an Android update: Silicon manufacturers (Qualcomm, Samsung Exynos, etc) "modify the new release for their specific hardware" and do things like make sure drivers and power management will still work. OEMs (Samsung, LG, HTC) step in and "modify the new release again as needed for their devices." This means making sure all the hardware works, rebranding Android with a custom skin, adding OEM apps, and modifying core parts of the Android OS to add special features like (before 7.0) multi-window support. Carriers add more apps, more branding, and "test and certify the new release." Project Treble is only addressing "step 1." Google and silicon manufacturers have finally created a stable "vendor interface" that the hardware and OS can plug into, a move we've suggested implementing in the past. Just as Google has OEMs pass a "Compatibility Test Suite" (CTS) that ensures that third-party Android apps can run on their OS implementation, silicon vendors will now have a "Vendor Test Suite" (VTS) that ensures "forward compatibility of the vendor implementation." Google says that VTS-compliant vendors can "choose to deliver a new Android release to consumers by just updating the Android OS framework without any additional work required from the silicon manufacturers." For now, there aren't many details, but Google says it will release the full documentation for Treble when the final version of Android O launches later this year. "No additional work from the silicon vendors" is only a third of the battle, though. Steps two and three above will still be issues. While VTS-compliant silicon vendors can choose to easily update to a new Android OS, Project Treble would only enable a "hands-off" OS update if OEMs use unmodified stock Android. Treble does not address skinning, custom apps, custom features, or any other changes to the core OS. Companies like Samsung will still change every single piece of the Android UI and add custom features, creating lots of work for themselves when update time comes along. Motivation is also still a problem. OEMs and carriers will still be a roadblock in the way of updates, and they are still free to drag their feet when it comes to updating older models. Google's blog post notes, "One thing we've consistently heard from our device-maker partners is that updating existing devices to a new version of Android is incredibly time consuming and costly." Updating Android will still be costly because OEMs and carriers will still be in the loop, and, because updating a device has a negative effect on companies' bottom lines, they're not motivated to actually do it. This also isn't the first time Google has promised to improve Android's update situation. The "Android Update Alliance"—a group of OEMs that totally pinky sweared to do a better job at delivering updates—was announced at I/O and was then immediately forgotten about. Still, this program sounds like a big help for Android's update situation, and it could carve out one step of the three-step process. If nothing else, it should help Google phones directly. Currently, Google phones like the Pixel are limited to only two years of major OS updates. This is pretty bad compared to Apple's update system, which has hit five years of support for some iOS devices. The "two-year update plan" is something that the entire Android ecosystem has mostly settled on, but, as Google describes, the first step in changing this would be to get Qualcomm to support an SoC for more than two years. With Project Treble enabled on the Pixel phones, Google now has no one to blame other than itself for the Pixels getting end-of-life'd. If consumers pressure Google to provide more than two years of major OS updates, the company can now totally do it. "Is this device Project Treble enabled?" is something we're going to have to ask at every single launch event from now on. OEMs can now be the first one to blame when an update doesn't arrive, and it should stop some of the finger-pointing that happens when consumers ask where their update is. Android O is clearly required, but it's very interesting that the Pixel phones were updated to include Project Treble. This means it's possible for devices like the Galaxy S8 to be updated with Treble as well. Now we get to see which OEMs really care about updates. No more excuses.         LATEST STORIES (9) Damascus: Most of Al-Qaboun District under Syrian Army Control Syrian Army Forces Repel ISIL Attack on Ithriya-Khanasser Road Iraqi Popular Forces in Battle with ISIL during 2nd Phase of Operations West of Mosul Iraqi Civilians Living in Ruins of Mosul Iraqi Popular Forces Take Control of More Border Villages, West of Mosul Syria: Army Inflicts Causalities on ISIL in Major Offensive in Eastern Homs Yemen: 1000s of Protesters Condemn US-Backed Saudi War in Sanaa 4th Islamic Solidarity Games Kick off in Baku Yemenis Stage Massive Protest against US-Backed Saudi War Karate Competitions at Islamic Solidarity Games in Baku “Mission Accomplished” Will Never Come in Afghanistan - Escalation or Not Grand Mufti: Jordanian Soldiers to Leave Syria in Tears Security Forces Foil Terrorists' Plot in Iran Syrian Army Seizes Back Control of Terrorists' Key Base in Eastern Damascus Iran Stresses Necessity for Preventing Formation of Terrorist Groups in Afghanistan Damascus: Most of Al-Qaboun District under Syrian Army Control TEHRAN (FNA)- The Syrian Army forces continued to advance against terrorists in al-Qaboun district, taking control over most of the Eastern part of the district.

Just like Microsoft’s BUILD conferences or Apple’s WWDC, Google I/O is mostly about software and services, where Google will introduce new software and potentially launch new services for its customers to check out, and we expect that this year will be no different. So below is a list of everything that you might be able to expect from the event which will be taking place from the 17th-19th of May, 2017. Android O Right off the bat we guess the biggest and most obvious thing we can expect Google to talk about at Google I/O would be Android O. This is Google’s latest update on its Android operating system and as it stands, a version number and its name (apart from the designated “O”) has yet to be revealed. A handful of features of Android O have trickled out ever since its developer preview was released, but we expect a more formal introduction at the event. Android Auto Android Auto is Google’s attempt at trying to bring a version of Android into cars and its infotainment systems. We’ve seen Google introduce various new features and updates to the platform, such as integrating Waze in Android Auto, so perhaps we’ll learn more about the future of the platform at the event. Android Wear This topic is a little tricky. Android Wear 2.0 was announced last year at Google I/O 2016, but due to several delays, the update was only just released to Android Wear smartwatches a couple of months ago. With the update being this fresh in everyone’s mind, we’re not sure if Google will even touch on Android Wear 3.0 so soon. Chrome OS One of the bigger changes that Google has done to its Chrome OS platform is giving it the ability to run Android apps. There have been talks about Google possibly merging Chrome OS and Android into a unified platform, but that has since been denied, with Google’s Hiroshi Lockheimer stating that both platforms are successful in their own regard and that merging them together doesn’t make sense. Earlier this year Google also hinted at the possibility that Chrome OS could be arriving in other form factors so maybe at I/O we’ll be able to get a taste of what’s to come. Google Home Google Home was launched last year and we expect that Google is probably working on a successor. Following Amazon’s launch of smaller and more compact Echo speakers, and also the Echo Show which comes with a touchscreen display, we wouldn’t be surprised if Google had a newer, smaller, and maybe touch-sensitive version of Home in the works as well. Google Assistant While voice assistants have existed on Android for the longest time ever, the launch of Google Assistant and seeing it integrated into various Google apps and services suggests that Google has bigger plans for the platform. Right now Google Assistant has made its way out of the Pixel phones and onto non-Pixel handsets, so we expect that Google will share more plans for the future of the software. Virtual Reality/Daydream Google’s interest in virtual reality and augmented reality aren’t new. Last year when the Pixel handsets launched, they were Google’s first Daydream-ready handsets and we wouldn’t be surprised if Google were to announce more partners that would be launching Daydream-ready devices. Let’s not forget Google’s recent acquisition of VR developers Owlchemy Labs, where hopefully the company will share some of their plans with what they plan to do with the acquisition in terms of hardware or software. Augmented Reality The Google Glass is Google’s answer to augmented reality and while the project was previously scrapped and rebooted, we haven’t really heard much about it since. Could Google have something to show us this year? Although with Google shutting down Glass-related social media accounts, it certainly doesn’t seem that way, but we’ll keep our fingers crossed. Project Tango Google unveiled Project Tango a couple of years ago, although it was only last year that a phone with the actual technology was launched in the form of the Lenovo Phab 2 Pro. Following that we saw ASUS launch a similar handset in the form of the ASUS ZenFone AR, and last we heard a new Lenovo Project Tango phone could also be in the works for 2017 which could be shown off at I/O 2017. Self-driving Cars While Google’s self-driving car efforts have been spun-off into a separate company in the form of Waymo, it is possible that Google could share what they’ve learnt so far from their efforts, maybe share some statistics and what the plans are moving forward, or maybe they’ll even give I/O attendees a demonstration of the self-driving cars in action. So this is what we think you could expect from Google I/O 2017. Some of them are pretty much a given, like Android O, but some are based on what we’ve seen Google talk about in the past, as well as some speculation and even hope of what to expect. This means that there is no guarantee that what is mentioned here will be announced at the event, but either way we will be covering the event so remember to check back with us from the 17th-19th of May for the details.

Informa Inside Self-Storage ISS Magazine Google Changes and Your Self-Storage Facility’s Mobile Website 2 days ago Comments Posted in Articles, Online Marketing, Marketing, Management Print By Sam Hook For years, experts have stressed the importance of having a mobile-optimized website for your self-storage business. Updating your website to ensure it performs well on mobile devices as well as desktop computers is significant. But we’ve finally reached the tipping point on this issue. How your site displays and performs on mobile devices is now more important than how it does on desktops. You can no longer think of your website as a desktop platform that works on mobile. Rather, you should consider it a mobile website that also works well on a desktop. Google has always been at the forefront of understanding how users interact with the Web. In this article, we’re going to cover some of the search engine’s major changes over the past couple of years that demonstrate the shift from desktop to mobile and how they could affect your business moving forward. An Increase in Mobile Searches Google announced in 2015 that it tallies more searches by people using mobile devices than desktop. A more recent study from intelligence-gathering platform Hitwise puts the figure at 58 percent. It seems likely from trend data that the figure has increased. Searches from mobile devices are even more important for self-storage companies than many other industries because a third of mobile searches have local intent, according to Search Engine Land, a source of search engine industry news and trends. “Local intent” means a person is searching for something related to a location, e.g., “storage near me,” or “storage in Phoenix.” Google’s Changes Google is as a critical source of traffic to your website, so you need to pay attention to any changes it makes. The company has been trying to get business website owners to move toward mobile optimization for years. Here are some of the things it’s done to encourage the transition: Accelerated mobile pages (AMP). This is a Google-backed project that provides a way for website owners to create pages that load quickly on mobile. How? By limiting the page content to little other than the main subject. The aim of AMP is to make browsing more pleasant for people who are using data on their phone. If you’ve started to implement AMP and want to know that you have everything set up correctly, you can use Google’s AMP Test. Mobile-friendly update. In April 2015, Google released the first version of its mobile-friendly update. This was a simple pass-fail test. Google looks over your site and checks whether it’s mobile friendly per certain factors. If your website doesn’t pass, Google won’t rank it as highly in the search results when someone is searching on a mobile device. Google updated this again in May 2016 to boost the effect. My company recently completed a study to determine approximately how many self-storage companies passed this test. About 18.3 percent of U.S. and 31 percent of U.K. storage websites failed. It’s likely this is an underestimate, and a higher portion of all storage sites would fail. If you want to check how your own site performs, you can use Google's Mobile-Friendly Test. However, it’s been brought up recently that you can pass the test yet still be labeled as not mobile-friendly if your site takes too long to load. Mobile-first index. This is the most important change, though it hasn’t yet been released at the time of this writing. With this change, Google is going to look at your site as if it’s being searched by a mobile user. This is essentially Google saying your mobile site is more important to it than your desktop site. Why make this change? Companies sometimes show users different content depending on the device they’re using. Considering most searches are now done via mobile, Google wants to know its serving the best results for this majority. These changes demonstrate how mobile is now more important than desktop for your storage company’s website. That means making sure your website displays correctly on mobile devices but also optimizing it for users and search engines. If you don’t keep up to date with the way things are progressing, you’re going to get left behind!

Google's answer to the Amazon Echo launched across the UK - including Coventry and Warwickshire tech stores - last month. The high-tech gadget not only plays music but provides information on request and obeys spoken commands, the Mirror reports. Tesco has now updated its If This Then That (IFTTT) channel to enable Google Home users to add products to their shopping basket using just their voice. Read More Owner of ice cream shop at the centre of near miss crash speaks out "Rather than setting up an individual IFTTT recipe for each product, you'll now be able to create just one recipe and then ask your Google Home to 'add milk to your Tesco basket' or 'buy more eggs'," Tesco explained. Google Home While Amazon Echo does something similar, allowing Amazon Prime customers to order products from Amazon.com using just their voice, Tesco claims its Google Home integration is smarter. Read More Aldi urgently recalls vanilla extract amid nut allergy risk fears "If you already shop with Tesco regularly we'll do our best to bias those search results towards the products that you'd normally choose, so that IFTTT will add your favourites/usuals for you – not just the first result," it said. "Another feature we've added alongside this is around existing orders. "If you already have a slot booked then IFTTT will amend the existing order and if you don’t it will just add it to your basket."

RIP: The Nexus 5 isn't getting Android 7.0 Nougat, let's say our goodbyes David Ruddock Follow View All Posts 2016/08/22 10:00am PDTAug 22, 2016 156 Plus 1 on G+ 1393 Share on Facebook 181 Share on Twitter Total Shares1730 Editorials News Nexus 5 Nougat 7.0/7.1 Videos While the Nexus 5 will likely live to see the chewy center of Nougat via community-built custom ROMs, it's now official that the phone so many of us loved will never get a Google-sanctioned Android 7.0 release. Let us mourn. The Nexus 5 launched in late 2013 - you can go back and read our review, in which Liam, Ryan, and I took to a single post to combine our thoughts on the device. They were largely positive, too: the Nexus 5 was easily the most well-received Nexus phone yet when it was released, with both consumers and reviewers alike praising its unique design, excellent performance, and compelling price. The Nexus 5 sought to really perfect the formula Google and LG laid out in the Nexus 4 and, in my opinion, they came exceedingly close. The Nexus 5 was the right phone, at the right time, at the right price. And lest we forget, it was the debut device for Android 4.4 KitKat, introducing us to features like immersive mode, the storage access framework, Google Now Launcher (as it was later known), and a more modern NFC payment system. The Nexus 5 was also the butt of battery life and camera jokes from day one, and honestly, I cannot believe how many of you here at Android Police are still using one. Looking at traffic in the last 30 days - nearly three years after the Nexus 5 was released - it remains easily in the top ten devices visiting the site (yes, I'm creeping on your device stats in our site analytics). It's downright impressive the level of dedication and, frankly, love people have shown for this phone, and I have to imagine many of you are on a second or third (or fourth?) battery replacement by now. But it just goes to show what a truly huge impact this phone had on the larger Android community. It was a big deal. So while the Nexus 5 won't be getting Android 7.0, passing the ominous "oldest supported Nexus" crown to the Nexus 6, it will likely be remembered for years as the Nexus phone - full stop. And I think that's appropriate. So, Nexus 5, farewell. I can only imagine how many people will be hacking Android 10.0 onto you another three years from now... assuming the battery lasts long enough to flash a ROM. Oh, and the Nexus 7 (2013) isn't getting Nougat, either. Rita made me throw that in for completeness. Here's my obit: the Nexus 7 was a thing, too. Both of mine broke. RIP, I guess. (I jest - mostly. The Nexus 7 was a fine little tablet, but there's no doubt the Nexus 5 overshadows it today.)

David Ruddock security patches are more like making sure the dogs don't get to the corpse on the way to the hole in the ground tbh SyCoREAPER I guess you guys have never visited XDA and seen the developers that keep devices alive. Quint’s Sharking & Seashells I Nouggat-it? OXCVO >.> Christopher Bement <3 Sam Del Valle RITA WHY Avisshek Rita for President 2016 Thomas Bohn No, high political offices in Libanon are not really safe offices. Avisshek I forget that she lives in Lebanon not in the US . mea culpa Thomas Bohn Just noticed, the office of president of Lebanon is vacant since 2014. Either everybody wants that office or nobody. Not really familiar with the politics of Lebanon. Except a friend of mine did his study abroad at the American University of Beirut. Which he described pretty much as a bubble in the city. Speakers at rallies are behind protective glass. But that was like 10 years ago. Stellar And then XDA said otherwise LOL Corbin Davenport Excuse me Nexus 5 owners, do you have a moment to speak about our lord and savior, CyanogenMod? John Johnson This! Flashing custom firmware became so easy my grandma could do it. YOTOPRULES . my grandma can't even turn a laptop on Airy230 You won't have me! Pure Nexus will be my light in the dark Đức Thành Pure Nexus is the shit, man. Avisshek blasphemy will not be tolerated, behead this infidel Kim Reyes well i think you must read the thread of Pure Nexus for Hammerhead, i think they released the last version for it too. Đức Thành Really? Damn. AverageDipper Oh no... I can't bear two heart breaks in a row. Well I guess I will wait for a porting like for the N7-2012 John Georgiou oh yeah Max I'm with you, my Nexus 5 will live and die as Pure Nexus forever. Charbel Aoun N5 owners don't care about updates , we have XDA (including CM, Ressurection Remix, pure nexus and planty others). Only noob users care Joshua Worth Or those of us that pride security over broken ass janked always some kind of bug ROMS Đức Thành I guess you haven't tried custom ROMs much these days? I'm not that heavy on trying out custom ROMs so I've only been using Pure Nexus on my N5 for a while now but it's fast and reliable and completely bug-free, or at least there's no bugs I know of that don't exist in stock ROM, too. And they even update it regularly, so security is not really an issue. I'm not sure other devices get the same treatment, but if we're talking about the N5 it's got it pretty sweet. Joshua Worth No you're right Nexus devices have had the least buggy Roms it's just all the effort that goes in to reading know if and keeping up I'd rather Google be the maintainer of my software rather than my own labor doing so. Gjorgi Lazarovski Tell me all about the bug free stock builds. CyberPunk ROM's built from AOSP are usually less buggy on Nexus/One devices compared to other devices. I'm I right in thinking that? Railwayman You are right - AOSP based ROMs are always working best on devices with readily available sources and developer friendliness - Nexus mostly even if there are some other brands as well. So the Nexus 5 will have a long happy XDA life. instinct Aren't you so cool because you unlock your device and put your own rom on? It's really not hard, but it's not something most users are going to want to do or care to do. Philip Worthington I agree with you, but then, most average users will have upgraded by now too, or didn't even buy a Nexus 5 as it was not a 'mainstream' phone brand. So, I'm guessing the Nexus 5 is now largely maintained by the people who keep it alive through ROMs, and by the people who upgrade as little as possible and don't care what OS they have as long as phone calls and Facebook works.

C64 Religion is BS Greets from your friendly neighborhood Atheist someone755 You'll have to take my AOSPA shrine from me over my dead body. jay Atheism is a religion too. C64 Do i worship an invisible not existing man? Do i pray to an invisible not existing man? Do i build a church for an invisible not existing man? Do i believe a fairytale of an invisible not exciting man? No i don't. I believe in science and come sense . So what part of atheism is the religion part? Adalberto Barbosa PWNED Railwayman It lies within the 'I believe in' part. Belief in nothing is still... a belief. Another thing: You can't prove the *non-existence* of something. It is possible to discuss probabilities and so on but not that something has been 'proven not to exist'. Atheism becomes a religion when it is backed up by statements implying that different things has been *proven* not to exist. Typical examples are 'I am an atheist because *I know* that there's no God' or 'I don't believe in God but in science'. Teal’c I really don't want to get in a religion war on here but, atheism is a lack of belief, it's not a belief system and most certainly not a religion. Religion has figureheads, it has teachings that adherents follow, the only thing that ties atheists together is a lack of belief in deities. That's it. Also where is it "backed up by statements implying that different things have been *proven* not to exist"? Railwayman There are different takes on atheism and without going more offtopic I can only say that *some* of its proponents use wording that revolves around the idea that they 'know' the non-existence of certain things, meaning that this 'knowledge' is the background of their stance. This type of atheism is usually linked to certain ideologies and is an integrated part of them. Joris Griffioen That's all fine and good but it's *not* a religion. Have you looked up the definition recently? Or ever? "the belief in and worship of a superhuman controlling power, especially a personal God or gods." Atheism is not a religion. It is the lack of religion. It's not really that hard to comprehend, but to make it easier here are some quotes: 1) If atheism is a religion, then bald is a hair color. 2) If atheism is a religion, then health is a disease. 3) If atheism is a religion, then abstinence is a sexual position. Railwayman It is a belief system simply put; sometimes mixed with ideology. Religions is the 'belief in a God', atheism is the 'belief' that those things doesn't exist and is therefore an opposite standpoint. The point stands: 'Belief in nothing is as much belief as the belief in something'. Neither religions or atheism are established 'facts' - they are simply different viewpoints and exist in different iterations, including ideological connections. I don't believe in 'belief systems' such as the traditional religious or atheistic ideas about 'fairytales' (common atheistic argument) or not 'fairytales' etc. The problem is always that the view becomes ideological, thus clouding the vision. I wouldn't dismiss ancient texts as being 'fairytales' - that kind of standpoint is ideological. Teal’c There are not "different forms of atheism" but there are "atheists who have different beliefs", as I said, the only thing that ties atheists together is a lack of belief in deities. Like Stalin was an atheist who murdered millions of people, but you're not going to claim that a tenet of atheism is murdering people are you? (There is a certain Catholic who is not a very nice person and actually posted a video equating atheists with Stalin but yeah, murder is not an "atheist belief") Coolington There's no different takes on Atheism, there is one and the synonym for it is non-belief. If you write your own definitions, do so, but don't pretend they are valid. An atheist is a person who does not believe in God or gods. That's the only definition that should be considered by anyone. Railwayman Pure atheism is what you write. Then there are 'political atheism' (i.e. atheism as a part of a political ideology or because of such ideology) and different takes where the 'belief in nothing is still a belief' apply. 'Political atheism' is usually demonstrated by people who 'in the name of atheism' want to prohibit certain things - a typical and controversial example is the issue of creation vs the Darwin theory. Political atheists typically are working hard on making Darwinism 'mandatory' in such a way that it becomes the 'truth' and all other theories are then 'wrong'. Especially theories related to creation in one way or another are in the 'wrong' category and heavily fought. There are several cases where 'atheism' is closely linked with politics and where it is heavily promoted as the 'right way', 'only truth' followed by 'prohibit religion' or 'prohibit ideas with connection to certain books' - the solution to everything is Darwinism and different theories whose major common denominator is that they are secular. I.e. secularity is more important than anything else and everything with any kind of 'religious' origin or connection are to be rejected. It is also common that 'atheism' and 'reasonable thinking' are claimed as being equal - i.e. 'every reasonable thinking person should be an atheist' (this is pretty common statements from 'political atheists'). Atheism isn't a 'proven fact' - it is a belief system that has developed as an anti-thesis against religious belief system. A key issue is that the statement 'There is no God' (which is quite common among atheists) break the rule of 'you can't prove the non-existence'. When statements along the lines of 'I know that there is no God' followed by things as 'We know that Darwinism is a fact - not a theory and that other theories are wrong because... we have proven Darwin as being right' paired with different 'prohibit X because X is a religious thing' - atheism simply goes right into the group of other ideologies and belief systems. A more reasonable way is simply put: 'I don't know whether there is a God or not - at this time the existence hasn't been proven and its non-existence hasn't been proven either since it is impossible so I remain neutral, open for both possibilities' and also 'the issue of the origin of the species is complex, Darwinism is a very compelling theory but there are also other theories - including those related to creation that are worth to explore further'. I accept 'pure atheism' but have an issue with 'political' or 'ideological atheism' where it is promoted as being a 'fact', 'science', 'scientifically proven' and so on, especially when it is linked to closing doors on any other theory or explanation model that have links to religious books and ideas. I.e. 'X is wrong because those ideas are based on religion and as an atheist I know that religion is wrong and just a fairy tale'. C64 Sciences proved that religion is BS. So end of story Railwayman Sounds like an ideology rather than a fact...;) jay You believe in nothing which is a belief none the less. You call yourself an atheist along with many other people who are like minded. That my friend is a religion. C64 That my friend is BS jay You are just different part of the same closed minded body of people you put down. I'm right, no I'm right, no I'm right. All the same. marcusmarcus2 Sure. How well does Android Pay work on it? Testraindrop As good as on stock ROM, oh wait its not available outside of US... marcusmarcus2 I'm inside the US and Android Pay does not work in CM13 for my LG G3 but works fine when I restored it to stock Android. So no, not as good as stock ROM. DucKienTruong I think you missed the joke Francois Roy Are you still living in 2010, or what? XD AOSP / Pure Nexus or bust.. Kristian Ivanov No. VAVAMk_2 RIP lil buddy Dale they should support nexus 5 instead of the nexus 9 - which all have hardware failures by now. nexus 5 running like a champ. Sir_Brizz I loved my N5 up until the moment I smashed the screen about a year ago. :( It's still one of my favorite devices design-wise. MJ Fuck! Nate Porter Well if they announce a new nexus today that i can buy to replace my N5 I won't be as mad. Alex Gourenko Goodbye old friend, you did amazing job and didn't age at all. Best phone I ever had! Jordan Smellie "I have to imagine many of you are on a second or third (or fourth?) battery replacement by now." Wait, I'm missing something. Last time I looked into N5 replacement batteries, the summary was: "Low-quality/fake replacement batteries are terrible, and some of them explode, and there is literally no way at all to tell whether the battery you receive is fake... unless it explodes, in which case it was fake. Good luck!" Has that changed? Because I am STILL on the original N5 battery, and it is... not great. Not as bad as I suppose it good be, and a lot better than an explosion, but still not great. Is there now a reliable source for high-quality N5 replacement batteries? Andrew There were some typos on "fake" batteries that people could spot supposedly. I ordered a "legit" one a few months ago and it seems alright. Todd How much better would a new battery be in my n5? I'm always plugged in so I don't really know how bad my battery is. I can still get about 2 hours screen time. Andrew You're good if you're still getting 2 hours. Mine was randomly turning off any time below 90% battery. Jordan Smellie Okay, fine. But you ordered a "legit" one from *where*? And how did you know it's "legit", since we don't know what to look for? Andrew This is what I went off of https://www.reddit.com/r/Nexus5/comments/3rrflh/how_to_spot_fake_nexus_5_battery/ FunkyRasta To me it was quite the opposite... original battery bursted in flames and smoke as I was prying it out of my N5 :D Luckily, the window was open and my hands quick. Chinese knock-off wasn't so bad to me after that. pfmiller Probably not a bad idea to drain the battery before doing surgery. Mark555055 https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nSz16ngdsG0/hqdefault.jpg Charbel Aoun We don't care google, we have XDA!! 😏😏😏 blindexecutioner So long. You run better than the 5X but I guess it had to happen at some point. Dmitry Teplyakov Waiting for nougat source code release! C64 God dammit, no update for my Galaxy Nexus eszklar LOL. I have two Galaxy Nexus running CM13. In XDA I trust to be running Nougat in the near future. Same for my Nexus 4. MJ What do you need so many old phones for? eszklar It's a personal thing with me - like my OG N7000 Note running Android 6.0.1. Why? Why not? My daily driver is a rooted Zenfone 5 still on KK as I haven't found a solid ROM for it. But I respect the community work done by CM/XDA. My HP TouchPad is running Marshmallow as well and its fun. samwichse I have my wife and my old Nexus S phones acting like home phones. Google voice means that when she leaves her current phone on the basement couch, I can reliably get her on the "upstairs phone"and so on. MJ What does reliably get hold of mean? All my calls go to VM and I will call you back when have time or what ever depending on the nature of the call. No one should be expected to always be available to pick up the phone or reply to a text immediately. samwichse "No one should be expected to always be available to pick up the phone or reply to a text immediately." And yet, always being able to HEAR the phone ring is pretty important when you have a family. Eker Nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo JSo It will live on with the developer community. But luckily I upgraded to the 5X. I will always cherish my Nexus 5 though. I love that device. ali0cha Same here. Upgraded from 5 to 5X and I miss Nexus 5's form factor. Now I must admit that I'm pretty happy of the 5X thanks to the addition of the fingerprint scanner but I sometimes miss the size of the 5. JSo I was actually wanting the 6P for it's size. But the 5X was cheaper. me me Best Nexus ever. Hope they can make a true successor. me me My Nexus 4 didn't get Marshmallow either but via XDA and a screwdriver it's got recent rom and fresh battery and going strong with LTE on T-Mobile David Ruddock man that must be one crazy screwdriver me me Lol I meant a screwdriver is used to replace the "non replaceable" battery pfmiller Those sonic screwdrivers can do anything.

Todd I uprooted a year ago so I could use my work email system... I might have to root again now. OXCVO 3 years and i'm still not ready to change my Nexus 5 to any other phone mitchilin Same. Had it since release day. No need to upgrade. psydex Did you change battery? mitchilin Nope. Battery is fine. Llama rocks. Emerald I'm getting a Nexus 5 this month, could you please explain me what Llama is? mitchilin Basically just an app to automate your phone. Eg: Leave house -> Turn off WiFi, dim screen, anything else to save battery Enter house -> Turn WiFi on, turn brightness to full, everything else It can take a while to 'learn' all the areas e.g. home, work but after that it is bliss. I have my phone to turn on to silent when i enter work for example. http://bit.ly/1THFX6B kks thanks for this! AlphaQWER "Leave house -> dim screen Enter house -> turn brightness to full" May i ask where do you live? In my hemisphere there is a trace of the sun ;) mitchilin England. OXCVO N5 has been a great phone all these years But hey, times change, so must our phone's I'll accept that later xD for now I'm going to keep using it mitchilin Yeah, I am so gutted though Hardtarget24 awww, my wife is still using a 5, kinda shocked it's not getting Nougat, doesn't feel much slower than my 5x. (also we still have a 2013 Nexus 7 that works fantastic, kinda too bad about that as well) roberto.elena Shocked? You must live under a rock. TechGuy22 aww too bad lol Aaron Berlin Great song written by the incomparable Paul Williams. N6Perfection ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ the incomparable Paul Williams https://fuzzytypewriter.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/paulwilliams.jpg Alastair Vincent The Nexus 5 was a fantastic phone but the 6P has more than adequately replaced it for me. I'm really mourning the end of the Nexus 7 2013. Still use mine every day and the £400 Pixel C is not a realistic replacement for my needs. Rita El Khoury This. There's no decent replacement for the Nexus 7 and I'm still using mine daily for AP work. So sad. pfmiller Still no decent replacement for the N5 as far as some of us are concerned :'( Todd We have high hopes for this year. pfmiller Yeah, specs seem good. Not crazy about the looks or the presumed lack of wireless charging, but it'll probably have to do. mike shwilly At least 5P doesn't have a fugly camera nose on the back N6Perfection ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ no decent replacement for the Nexus 7 K1 /problem james fuston The K1 isn't exactly 'readily available' in the US. Most major retailers show it as out of stock and have for quite some time. Alastair Vincent The K1 is the best option, I think, but it's still a third party device and I refuse to buy those unless I absolutely have to. When my 7 dies I'll probably get a K1 or whatever is available then. Cory Wilson Eh I disagree. I upgraded to the k1 and I still like the nexus 7 better overall. Nexus 7 doesn't get laggy if you don't reboot it every 24 hours, and the k1 also has terrible battery life. Also the nexus 7 looks aesthetically more pleasing, and is lighter in the hands. Shield's better for gaming, and the stereo speakers are facing the right way and are louder and clearer but aside from that the nexus 7 2013 is better imo N6Perfection ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ N7 is very nice, indeed, and you're right about the k1 battery being sucked by the heavy gfx capability, but the K1 is the 2nd most beautiful creature (1st is our OG Shield Tablet with charging light, Nvidia stylus and charging light) I've ever seen. I had the N7 for a while when they had that $99 dollar sale, but at its intro price of 199 (same as the K1), Nividia knocks the N7's dick in the dirt. I never had lag or reboot problems, ever. Last time I looked I had uptime in the thousands of hours. but it does get hot when I play SkyForce for extended periods and take it out of the case. Do you have a custom ROM in it? I still say it's the best, dollar-for-dollar tablet in the world. I used to fantastize about an Nvidia 5.5" phone that matched the K1. cormaster628 No I mean I have to reboot once every day or 2 or it gets laggy. I just hope it gets nougat a big reason I upgraded was knowing the nexus 7 would most likely be cut off. I don't see why it wouldn't. Even the original shield tablet is around the same age as the nexus 9 which is getting the update mike shwilly Why not Shield Tablet? Rita El Khoury I want a Nexus tablet, for the no-fuss updates. Also the K1 is almost a year old by now, and that's based on a year old tablet to begin with. I want something to last me another 3 years. Allen D Ehh except it's been updated pretty well over its life. Its only 6.0.1 though NVIDIA is a smidge slower than they should be on occasion. Honestly unless there something super crucial its gone from 4.4.4-6.0.1 and will get 7.0 at some point. I'd put NVIDIA about third for consistent updates on their products beyond HTC lol. Sergii Pylypenko Will Google release another 7-inch $200 tablet? With AMOLED screen and Tegra K1 this time? Fatal1ty_93_RUS Shield Tablet? marcusmarcus2 Pretty sure they mean no replacement for it within the Nexus family. LANCE Nexus 6 replaced my 2012 lol Rich Taylor If you find a good one, let us know. Lots of people out there still using the N7. I actually replaced it with a new N7 last year because I love it so much. drksilenc I have been using the nvidia shield first gen as a replacement for mine. Lord Argyris Best Netflix and YouTube machine ever. I don't use it for much else these days, but when I'm on a video binge it's my go-to. Battery is still good, and while its age is finally showing in its UI performance, it still does everything I need it to do. I might go with CM or Pure Nexus going forward, or I might just stick with Marshmallow for another year and hope Google releases a viable replacement. Imparus 6P is to big for my hand, so have been waiting on the Nexus 5 v2 that the 5x was suppose to be. someone755 I broke my 2012 N7 (that I stupidly bought in April 2013). It would need a display and digitizer replacement, which would end up costing me around $60 (+shipping, taxes, and the time I'd spend repairing it). Thing is, for that money I could get a used one. Not to mention it's slow as all hell. I've been searching for a tablet to replace it but nothing comes close to what a 2013 N7 could offer for its original price. james fuston The Zenpad S is worth a look. I replaced my N7 with it Urmil Shroff This article almost makes me cry. R.I.P. Nexus 5💔🌹😭 Michael Schaap But how about the Galaxy Nexus? David Ruddock sure right after Google releases Android 7.0 for Eli Whitney's original cotton gin eszklar "I find your lack of faith in CM/XDA disturbing." **(Apologies to Darth Vader)** roberto.elena There are rumors Texas Instruments' engineers are looking into it. 30014 We don't talk about the galaxy nexus around here. Nothing but bad memories. james fuston Alternate song choice https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w6m-nhUcos David Ruddock shit yeah RaiDei I will NEVER say goodbye. My Nexus 5 is my backup phone right now. I've had to go back to it three times in the last year and a half. I'm hopeful that the 5P (or whatever the Sailfish will end up being) is a worthy successor. I can't wait to get back to a 5" phone. Anders https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JWTaaS7LdU Brazilian dude As a person who lives in a country were taxes are huge and the last Nexus to come here was the N5, I still won't let him go. The Motos are really expensive and even devices like Moto G are not that different compared to the N5. It's a shame, but still going strong after 2.5 years. FunkyRasta If only Google would do it all over again... Keep the design, replace plastic with metal if you must BUT DON"T BRING SOMETHING SO ATROCIOUS AS 5X. I'm losing hope on Sailfish too with that big chin and thick edges. Seriously, slap AMOLED on it , bigger battery and 821 and there you go ! Man can keep dreaming. For me the best designed android phone ever. Materials could have been better though. pfmiller No, no metal. It's not at all worth sacrificing wireless charging for. cvm It can use a metallic frame like the 2014 moto X. pfmiller If they must. As long as they don't sacrifice anything for it I don't particularly care what they make it out of. Renaldi I. I cringe when I think about the crack in the frame next to the volume rocker. :( My N5 was still precious though. Curse the infidel who kidnapped it from me. YOTOPRULES . not amoled, screen burn-ins. wade_county http://i.imgur.com/394Qm3p.gif Pedro o Raposo Best phone I ever had, even after having to replace the flex cable! Good night sweet prince, I love you... shhhhh... it'll all be over soon.. *covers phoneps face with a pillow* Namra Reading this on a Nexus 5 !!! samwichse Replying to this on my Nexus 5 :) Erik Patrón Replying to this reply on a Nexus 5 YOTOPRULES . Replying to this reply to this reply on my PC MilwGuy Replying to this on my laptop, while crying over my Nexus 5 sitting next to it. Ben If you used the logic that a phone died once it's not going to get updated, you could say about 85% of current Android phones are dead. Koen Scholten Now I need to put both my Nexus 7 and Nexus 5 to rest :'( Mako Sold it today, bye buddy :( Đức Thành Incredibly sad news as I've got both a Nexus 5 and a Nexus 7 2013. MrSonicBoom Mines still a great backup device. Needed it a couple of times already. lomsha Lol George Byers Rip, that poll you guys ran a couple weeks back asking if you ran a custom rom would probably have much different results of it were asked again today. Mike in KC Easily the best money I've spent on a cell phone to date. Just recently moved to the 5X, but got tons of use out of my N5's (wife used one as well). Charlie Paxton Too bad, I really like my Nexus 5! I still think the Nexus 4's case design is unparalleled, btw. Perfect proportions. Benoit Bourdua Still using mine as daily driver. Original battery and all. Better than even odds on keeping it one more year. I will have a look at the new 5-incher but I'm not ready to let wireless charging go. Defenestratus All smallphones must die. Boolean Corporation My wife started using my old N5 32GB when her Moto G ran out of storage with only three apps. I once told her that she could take my spare iPhone SE and she told me she didn't want to get jumped. I proceeded to tell her that I'd be more pissed off if somebody stole the N5 than the iPhone. I just love that thing. It was the best Nexus. I'm on a 6P right now but really missing that form factor. cnccnc I'm sure telling your wife that you're more worried about which phone gets stolen than her went over well. Amirite? Boolean Corporation Actually that is not what happened, but I'm amused you understood it that way. Joshua Worth Good old jerkboys can't update the Nexus f---ing 5 past Marshmallow yet iPhone 5s is about to get iOS 10 clearly the Nexus Product Team and Google Android Team aren't trying to compete. Apples to Androids I know but come on Google I want to love Android but you're making it so difficult Mikhail Pozdnyakov Pomyanem pacani ;( refthemc Went through 2 of these bad boys. Shame that the power button always starts to fail Kenneth Porter Experiencing this now. pfmiller Mine has gotten stuck twice, but only for a few hours of trouble all told. Aside from that it works perfectly. Kenneth Porter I cracked the glass on my N5 a week ago and my N7 stopped working the day before yesterday. They were faithful devices. RIP Kenneth Porter Still using N5 despite the crack though. So is it a zombie? samwichse I just bought a replacement front glass from eBay 2 weeks ago First phone glass I've ever broken and it was spectacular (a long cartwheel across a parking lot after caroming of a concrete curb). Kenneth Porter First glass I've ever broken to. My drop wasn't as epic it was literally 1foot from the ground. How difficult was the repair? Or did you get someone else to do it? samwichse There were a lot of little pieces to transfer over, but not really actually difficult to do. The hardest part is unsticking the battery without damaging it. Rod My N5 is still going strong, 2 years and 4 months after. And I don't plan on replacing it any soon. I hope Sailfish turns out alright, anyway. It sucks to lose official updates, guess I'll need to resort do XDA now. Hugo Just got the OTA on my 6p:) Joshua Worth I had about 20 different Nexus 5's so you could say I had a thing for them Hugo If I unenroll my device from the betaprogram after receiving the stable build will it still "downgrade" and reset the device? Andy Chow I own two Nexus 5, and both still have good batteries. I can't believe that I now need to replace them. What a waste! I can't believe Google doesn't give us 3 years full support. It was released October 31st 2013. Bad Google, bad. No other phone appeals to me. The Nexus 6p a little, but Nexus 5 is the design I love. Rufflow Why? It doesn’t stop working this evening you know. Shivam Agrawal Will the 2014 Android One devices receive the Nougat Update? TigerMike901 Still using a N5 in the family, but it was bought as "new" on ebay last Nov, so I guess it still has a bit of life left in the old girl. Well, sad but not unexpected, that it won't get 7.0, so here's my moment of silence........................ok let's party for 7.0 release!!! Fatal1ty_93_RUS Don't worry, Nexus 5 guys. Us Nexus 4 folks share your pain and know how you feel right now Yaki Forto WHAT ABOUT ME??? I watched in horror as my N4 wasn't updated to MM, even though it could handle it, and now history is repeating itself with my N5! WHYY GOOGLE WHYY??? mattcoz Hopefully this period of mourning will be short lived and Sailfish will be released soon. Namra Heart=broken Testraindrop Still using my Nexus 5, first battery still, still more or less the same battery life as in the beginning. Oh and it has wireless charging... And I will continue to use it for at least another year if Sailfish won't have wireless changing and will be too expensive compared to direct competition again like last years Nexus devices in Europe. My N5 will get N like my 2nd N4 currently runs Marshmallow. Bryan Pizzuti What's a "Nexus 7 (2013)?" Is that like a bigger Nexus 5? Were only 2013 of them made? That might explain a lot. Railwayman It seems like the cave is a bit dark but simply put: A "Nexus 7 (2013)" is a 7 inch tablet with a Snapdraon S4 made by Asus as a successor to the original Nexus 7 from 2012, which then became known as the "Nexus 7 (2012)" in order to keep them separated. The LTE version is a bit like a "bigger Nexus 5" but don't have a dialer for regular phone calls but also weaker hardware (Snapdragon 800 in the Nexus 5). The number of devices manufactured is way higher the "2013" BTW. Pascal Shame that Google can't update 4 phones. b0b Who cares when there is Allo and Duo running on your N5. Without doubt the most important software of the last 10 years, relegating new Android versions to insignificant status. codemonkey85 I'd be satisfied as long as the Nexus 5 and / or 6.x and earlier devices get Google Assistant. Sam Del Valle Goodnight sweet prince JD Good night sweat prince Rich Taylor RIP. It was the 1999 Toyota Camry of Smartphones. Arthur Dent Erm. Ok. Simps Had mine from release and still on the original battery and screen. On my 4th pack of screen protectors though. Hope to find out soon if she will be staying with me another year or not.... benkxda Choose your ROM: https://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2475401 Arcest There's almost no difference in buying Nexus to buying Samsung. Google doesn't update few years old devices anyway. Leonardo Baez you dont know what are you saying. Samsung get updates 6 to 8 month later. Arcest Ok, maybe android updates should be paid, so it makes sense for manufacturers to put money on the already sold devices. Arthur Dent Lol, you're funny. Manufacturers need to move devices. They don't care about updates, or the few hundred or few thousand customers that might actually pay a couple of bucks for it. That's pocket change to them. To be clear, there's no way in hell most people would even consider paying for an Android update. Most people never update Windows, that's why Microsoft was giving away hundreds of millions of free upgrades for Windows 7 and 8.1 computers. Because VERY FEW people ever actually pay to upgrade Windows and they wanted to move as much of their user base to Win10 as possible. Mathias Why? Hardware can't handle the update? Or is google just too lazy to support their own phone? Testraindrop The second Leonardo Baez actually business model. If theys till support it, many people will not buy a new one Abdullah Alam Shh Leonardo Baez well... he asked Ali Mahdavi Hey AP Introduce a hashtag for this post, so we can share our 'Goodbyes' on Twitter with it. Ali Mahdavi #AufWiedersehenN5 Arabella Blair I wasn't expecting this to be a problem for me, since they always used to launch the software with the new Nexuses... I need that new phone to replace my poor dying boy! Max I couldn't agree more, the Nexus 5 will always be remembered as *The Nexus Phone*. It's the first phone in my life that I used for more than one year and that I didn't get rid off after upgrading, I still have it at home and every few months I turn it on, update everything and play with it for a couple of nostalgic minutes. Faheem Ahmed :( so sad about nexus 7 and nexus 5 L((( there were really capable both in ram and hardware....google screw u! apple still supports its iphone 5s Pawbro Google should seriously rethink their Nexus support model. 18 months is way too short, barely enough for 2 major updates and this nothing special, other manufacturers can do it as well, only the speed of delivering the updates is on Google side but it's not enough. Nexuses should be the Android flagships with real long term support for like 36 months, Apple can pull this off, Google could as well. Marco Lancaster I agree, but now Google is launching 2 devices per year, then will have more devices to support, so consequently they hardly will change this. Pawbro Apple does it as well and they can work with this. Right now if I'm not wrong they support iPhones 5s (that was released in 2013 as well and still is scheduled for OS update), 5c, 6, 6s, 6s Plus (it's already 5) with new ones around the corner, then iPads which are a few devices as well. For a company like Google it shouldn't be a problem to support 8 devices in total (6p, 5x, 6, Player, Pixel C (I don't even know what is this), 9 and additionally 5 and 7 2013). tiger iPhone 5 support as well...released in 2012 still getting the latest. drksilenc With alot of features stripped out... tiger Like what? Sudev 3D Touch, raise to talk are hardware specific features. iPhone 5, 5c, 5S are getting all the software features i.e. iMessage enhancements, Lockscreen, HomeScreen and under the hood changes and not to mention security enhancements. Ryan Johnson The OS itself is still the latest supported version. Why do people expect every iOS release to have all the latest features on old devices? Mark 2 years is not too short at all. 2 years is enough for many people, who change theyr devices in 1-2 years. 3 years would be good, but even then people will complain for a short time Pawbro It is too short. It doesn't matter that some people change phones all the time. 3 years is something around Apple support time, if Google could upgrade their support time to Apple levels it would be enough to satisfy majority. Mark of course 3 years would be great, but 2 is enough and, considering the community, we can't complain sproc Yeah, about apple. They just stopped selling the iphone4s a few months ago, and won't be updated to the next version of ios. Think of the Indians. Or really, so what? Joris Griffioen Apple's phones are also literally twice as expensive... Phoenix Nessun italiano? Mark io xD Phoenix in trepidante attesa delle factory Mark vuoi fare una installazione pulita? Phoenix proprio così Brian Jones My Nexus will forever live on 😔 Pimbiolina A pitty really. Please Google, reconsider it! mizkitty Still the perfect Kali NetHunter device... TylerChappell Man, I was really hoping that the Nexus 7 would receive 7.0 as a final sendoff! It really would have been absolutely perfect after all. Android 7.0 on a 7.0-inch device, ugh! But with July 2013 being when the tablet was released, I wonder too if the Nexus 7 will get a Marshmallow build with a September security patch since it is already on the August patch. The August patch could perhaps very well be the last update the ole trusty 2013 Nexus 7 will ever see! putte40 Nexus 5? Gave it away to my mother in law. The galaxy nexus on the other hand i still call "the nexus" Mikhail Oh, well. I was planning to change my phone anyway, I did want it to try android 7 before getting a new one, just in case... but whatever :'( Sohanur Rahman RIP Legend :( Mix RIP My heart was mending from two nights ago and this just added another hole. If you read buckle up, it's a roller coaster but it ends like prom night.....sadness. My Nexus 5 went into colourful screen confetti mode and became useless, someone suggested a port flex cable could fix it as they had a similar issue. COOL, lets try it out! I ordered one and took everything apart, WAY easier than I had hoped but it didn't work, phone wouldn't even charge. I take everything apart and hook up the stock flex cable, phone charges and screen turns on just doesn't have an image..... This is where I figure, ok maybe I did didn't have everything pressed in firmly on the replacement port flex cable. I hook up the replacement port flex cable that I ordered and put everything back in place, plug in the charger and POOF a little puff of smoke shoot out from the top half of the phone, above where the port flex cable goes. I unplug and quickly grab my phone to go outside thinking it was going to blow up...nope, just fried something in the top section of my phone. This $15 cable 100% destroyed my phone but at least the seller is giving me my money back. Yay? moogle.nine I'm not burying my N5 until it's original battery dies! (Or until we get some release dates for the new Nexii) It actually holds a charge pretty well for being almost 3. Daniel Gherard Time to wait for Cyanogenmod 14. ManInAbox Third battery here, would have upgraded last year but the 6p was too big and the 5x was underpowered, and all the other phones have glass backs ffs. Dmitry Stepanushkin Same. Third battery. whispy_snippet Nexus 5 with original battery FTW! *sad face* Oliver Cervera ✔ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ "We've only just begun"? Wut? My choice for this kind of farewell "For Those About To Rock, We Salute You", you also got fireworks, what else you can ask. Squiddles And here I am with my Nexus 4 ;_; Dmitry Stepanushkin mine fallen and front glass broke. RIP Bruce Wayne Ehhhh...easily one of my most hated phones. The design was generic and bland. The back was uninspiring and looked like a plain module. With its battery, camera and GPS issues, I couldn't wait to upgrade to the Nexus 6. I certainly don't miss that phone. Gunnar Lindberg Årneby Lame Google! Nexus 5 may have launched in 2013 but its still just one generation behind. Now we have to get our developers new phones and buying a 5X today seems like a bad move. Dmitry Stepanushkin Well Android 6.0.1 will be supported for a long time and there is no single feature in 7.0 I cant live without. Still we have some security updates. Unless these new Nexuses will be like wooow in both price and quality, I see no problem staying on Nexus 5 for another year or two. As long as it will work. danifeb The best article ever red on ap _jack_ Does anyone have a list (or remembers) the prices of all the nexus phones? I remember them with competitive prices at the beginning. But the current generation is far away from that (at least for Europeans; 5X with 32 GB is 550 USD, 6P with 64 GB 800 USD in the Play Store). I know, even in Europe there are some retailers like Amazon with cheaper prices, but that's almost one year after the release (the 5X is 320$ there currently for me) and I don't want to wait that long when the new devices are shown later this year ;) Yaki Forto Remember the $300 N4? That went on sale to $200 after a year in the States from the Play Store? _jack_ I think it was a high-end device by the time of its release; so 300$ is pretty good :) yaman koudmani Yeah, it was the best phone you could buy. Literally. When it was released, *very* few could rival it in sheer specs. JD So I can almost accept this and move on. Except Google didn't give us a new Nexus that we can move on to. Don't anyone dare say the POS 5x. OG N5 and KitKat I shan't forget you. You converted me from iOS, and now Google is doing everything in its power to convert me back. Seriously Apple doesn't even need to lift a finger. I really want to stay the course. Lollipop I'll never forget how much of a POS you were. HTC and Google make Android Great again. Willem Toren What battery problems? My Nexus 5 still going strong on the original battery. Still love this phone! minica So, David, what is the other 9 most used phone to visit AP? James Brown Thank God for CyanogenMod! Nougat will live for the Nexus 5. Dragos Lucian The amazing people on XDA will keep it alive for a few more years. ArclightX Channeling GroundsKeeper Willie... "I didn't cry when me own father died... but I'll cry now" /bawls... Lex.Butler Maybe the fact we are still using a product that is nearly 3 years old is that the era of constantly upgrading is over. It's ended in tablets, PCs and cars so why not mobiles? Vano Beridze I bought it in 2013, been loving it from the day one. Even today this is the prettiest phone for my taste. Persuaded my brother to bought it in 2014, Made a present to my wife in 2015. All of the Nexuses run fine. Because mine was the early model, I had to replace the power button. The phone came with Android 4.2, updated to 4.3, 4.4, 5.0 and recently 6.0. Updates were quick and till the end of this year security updates will be available. Hopefully Sailfish will be the worthy successor. I don't blame Google for not giving us Nougat. Even on Marshmallow the device starts to show its age. Still will be using it till next year good sale of Sailfish. Hope to get it for $250 :) Robin Steinberg Press F to pay respects. Yoy Guys, do you know if there's already custom rom for N5? 10x Robert Been a proud owner of a Nexus 5 almost from release. Never replaced battery, always stock android experience for me, still using it to this day. Now i think i'll wait for some good N port by the good folks at XDA, and then port over. IF i don't end up buying the new Nexus, which does not seem to be high-end specs at low price like the N5 was. So chances are i'll be using my trusted Nexus 5 for quite a while still =) Buckeye Kenny The Nexus 7 ended up convincing me to sell my iphone 5s and get a Nexus 5x Nexus5Rules Oh, damn it! TO HELL WITH GOOGLE. Let's build our own ANDROID N for our dear NEXUS 5♥ Darth Karki Yep, still on my wonderful launch Nexus 5. No battery replacements. No case. No nothing. Just this wonderful phone. Still just as smooth as the day I got it. I even tried out a Moto X Pure for a couple weeks but ended up returning it as it's SLOWER than the Nexus 5. Unbelievable. Still waiting for something to top it. Paul Still using Nexus 5 myself and it would of been nice if they supported 7.0 and from what I heard it seems the phone could support it but then it's no big deal, most software will run like it always does so little changes, probably got another year or year and half with the Nexus 5 before I upgrade, boy is that going to be a big upgrade lol. Logan Snyder The writing and the music, so perfect. Really makes something as simple as a device no longer getting updates seem like a proper funeral. Lucas Araujo My Nexus 5 have almost 3 years (bought in December 2015), have a cracked screen, the power button is barely working, the battery is showing signs that need to be replaced, the LTE does not work here in Brazil (bought in Canada, incompatible frequecies), but is still a MONSTER! RIP! ='( Harold_Mansfield Ugh! That Nexus 7 info at the end hurt. I'm on my 4th Nexus 7. Best little tablet ever. Guess it's time to start thinking about moving on if I want to run the latest OS. I'm sure my 7 will find a new life as a simple reader or entertainment remote. Mike Pick up a Shield K1 if you can find one. The only other worthy android tab IMO, and I'm sure they will update it soon to Nougat. Biff Wonsley I just bought a Zenpad Z380M, the 2gb, 8" version, for $129. It's great for browsing, messaging, RSS, Reddit & books. Sure, it's got the crapware, but it's easy to ignore/disable/not worry about, especially when I remember how little I paid for it. Harold_Mansfield Thanks for the tip. Will check it out. Gabriel Macys RIP N5. I need a replacement now. Aside from a screwed up proximity sensor for calls, it works as fine as the day I bought it. Ameya RIP ... Am using since 2013 Looks like time to buy new one.. Any suggestions? What about new Nexus 2016 device? when its releasing ? are they going to release ? Miguel Fernandes My favourite android phone, bought a S7 today just because of the battery. Uncle_Rico I did the same thing in like in mid June.. my battery was dying in less than 2 hours... and the power switch was double-tapping when trying to turn on the display, shutting it OFF instead..!?!? I loved that phone though.. until it hit the "100,000 mile" mark... :/ truskymx May the 5 be with you. Badelhas That settles it. I love my m8 but if the next nexus is as follows as the 6p but in a small factor I will buy it. latz Easily the best Nexus phone released. 5x was/is a missed opportunity.... gakukid im gonna buy a cheap phone sone and was thinking between a nexus 5 and a LG G3 what would you guys thiink would be the best? Im kind of worried about the battery of Nexus 5 Evil Nick Never had battery problems. Love that phone. Vladan Nikolic Noooo moriel5 Back when I still had my Nexus 5 (from the AP&Avast giveaway here, it was stolen half a year later(and the police, unsurprisingly, did nothing at all, not even what they were required by law (I have a neighbors who are lawyers, I made sure to research this, it's just too bad that it was not worth the financial expenses)(there is a bias in my country against the citizens, however, murderers who were brought from outside by the US and the USSR, and continually receive support from them, and the UN, although they didn't even have an "official" state until a few decades ago (and I'm not talking about those who are innocent (yes, there are innocents, but it gets completely blown out of proportions in the news) receive the support from our government and and military that the citizens are supposed to receive (I'm leaving out identifiable details, so people who are not familiar with the situation may not understand my words precisely, sorry about that))), with some tweaks, I could use it according to my needs (which involve a lot of on-screen time and internet (back then I didn't have LTE, so WiFi/3G) for over half a day, so I have defeated the battery conundrum (as it was without compromising on over 90% of the native functions)(NamelessROM, no GMS, Xposed, and removing uneeded system apps, as well as replacing others with better alternatives). Evil Nick Who the hell has a nexus phone stock anyway ha ha ha Joshua Tanton I got my Nexus 5 right when they came out. Ordered it directly from Google. So on the first battery, never had any problems with it. So I don't understand the author ripping on its batteries. Also as an Android developer, kind of annoyed 7 won't be supported. I'll probably have to get a new device soon :(. What's worse though is that the next Google phone (which is losing the Nexus brand) will be loaded with bloat-ware instead of the wonderful Android stock. One of the main reasons I got a nexus to begin with. Jorge Juan Chico Running the N5 everyday for more than 2 years now and my battery still lasts the whole day easily. Currently on Cyanogenmod to test but I will likely stay here and wait for OTA updates. M is good enough for the N5, but it should run fine in N also. Jason Honingford What should Nexus 5 users upgrade to? Wireless charging is my favorite feature. I'm just waiting for the next phone that still supports it. MilwGuy My Memorial Speech: My Nexus 5 still has its original battery and the original Google case that was released in the beginning. It's never given me any major issues. Almost every app I've installed has worked great, with some oddball third- party exceptions. The camera was a bit annoying in 2013, but the updates since have really cleaned it up. Even now it's just received another Google patch update ready to install. It just keeps working. It will be difficult to let it go. It will never die. It will go on. :'-( Porga Croaticus The best phone I ever had. Serves me well even today. battery is still great. Will not be changing it as long as it last. Did not seen any new feature it cant handle, abd 5" screen with FullHD is still a standard. Fantastic phoone, great design. TestUser UserTest At least the most sold out Nexus 5 should get Android N :( Tom Horsley Actually, the Nexus 7 was the perfect tablet. It is exactly the right size and screen resolution. I cannot believe it is impossible to get a seven inch tablet with a high resolution screen these days, but they all seem to be either 8 inch (which is too big to hold comfortably) or seven inch with a crappy screen. Ed Ross I'm still using mine (well actually it is a replacement one as after a couple of years of use my original one developed a fault where the wifi would not work - glad I had insurance!). Thanks to the Lineage OS developers I'm now running Android 7.1.2 on it, with the May security patches too! I'm going to use this thing until it is impossible to use it any more.

Like a pro LG G6 review - - - Google announces Project Treble, a modular base for Android aiming to make updates faster Post your comment Comments (36) Vlad 12 May 2017 Google Android Here's the thing: Android version updates are a painfully slow affair for every device that isn't a Nexus or Pixel. This has been the reality ever since the operating system's inception, and so far nothing has managed to change the situation. But Google thinks that it can help, at least somewhat, by incorporating a modular base into its OS, starting with the Android O release later this year. Up until this point, here are the steps that have been required for an OS update on a non-Google device to make it into your hands: Quite complicated indeed. But from this point on Android will gain a "Vendor Interface" (VI), thanks to a new development effort Google calls Project Treble. The VI's aim is to separate the "Vendor Implementation" (that is, "the device-specific, lower-level software written in large part by the silicon manufacturers"), from the Android OS framework. The new VI will sit in between the Android OS framework and the aforementioned Vendor Implementation. And the new VI will be validated by a Vendor Test Suite (VTS), which is analogous to the Compatibility Test Suite (CTS) that Google has been using for API testing of apps. The VTS will ensure forward-compatibility of the VI. The benefits of this approach are pretty obviously laid out in the images above. Before, the VI needed to be reworked after every single Android OS framework update, while from this point on that won't be the case anymore. This does indeed have the potential to speed up the update process for end users, but probably not by a lot. Your handset's manufacturer will still add its own "features" on top of the new Android release, and some of those will still need rewriting. Nothing changes from that point of view. It's only that, with Project Treble, no additional work will be required from silicon manufacturers before a device maker can get into that process. Project Treble is already live in the first developer preview of Android O, and it will come to all new devices launching with Android O preinstalled. In addition to all this, Google says it's working with its silicon and device making partners to move some of their code changes, such as specific features for a specific network in a specific country, into the Android Open Source Project code. That means the developers of that code (say, Sony and Qualcomm) won't need to rework those patches for every new Android iteration anymore.

By: Shilpa Published: Saturday, May 13, 2017, 8:00 [IST] There were lots of rumors speaking about the upcoming Google Pixel devices. Some rumors have also claimed that the codenames of upcoming Google handsets will be Walleye, Muskie, and Taimen. As per the information is known so far, Walleye and Muskie will be the codename for Google Pixel 2 devices whereas, the Taimen is rumored to be a brand-new tablet. Now the same Taimen has appeared on benchmarking website, GeekBench and as expected, it gave away some details concerning the specs and features of this upcoming device. Let us see what are that information in brief. Stay tuned to GizBot for more updates! Benchmarking score The Google Taimen has maintained to record an amazing single-core score of 1804 while the multi-core score was 6248 on Geekbench site. Also Read: Google Pixel and Pixel XL get a price cut of Rs. 13,000 The GeekBench listing does not reveal much about the device. It just speaks about the chipset and RAM integrated on the phone. Chipset used This listing does not exactly reveal the name of the processor used. It just says that the chipset will be 1.9 GHz octa-core SoC and as per the rumors, it may be powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon 835. Everyone are expecting this device to be something bigger in size. Rumors do say that this model may be having a display of size 6-inch or more than that. Other details revealed Other than chipset, this benchmark listing revealed some information regarding the Operating system and the RAM provided along with that. This says that the device with codename Taimen will have 4 GB of RAM and runs on the Android O which is the upcoming version of Android OS. Stay tuned to GizBot for more updates! There were some earlier reports claiming that the Google Taimen may not belong to the Pixel family, instead, it will be out as a tablet or a successor of Nexus 6. So, let us wait for some more time until company officially announces this device. But, we can consider this Taimen as the biggest competitor for popular handsets like Galaxy S8 because of its high-end specs.

This week, US District Court William Alsup made two decisive decisions in the lawsuit between Google’s autonomous vehicle spinoff Waymo and Uber. You know, the one accusing Levandowski of swiping 14,000 confidential documents from and taking them with him to Uber. First, Alsup rebuffed Uber’s efforts to settle the case in arbitration, so the drama will play out publicly during a trial. Waymo loved that. “We welcome the court’s decision today, and we look forward to holding Uber responsible in court for its misconduct,” it said in a statement. More troubling for Levandowski, Alsup referred the case to the US Attorney’s office “for investigation of possible theft of trade secrets based on the evidentiary record supplied thus far.” Translated from legalese, Alsup thinks something criminal might have happened here and that the feds ought to take a look. That raises the possibility of prison time for Levandowski. Such a referral is “quite, quite rare,” says Peter Toren, an intellectual property lawyer and former Department of Justice attorney. “For a judge to do that, he must believe there’s a lot of smoke, if not fire, for criminal violations.” Things could go from bad to worse for Uber if the judge grants Waymo’s request to put the brakes on the startup’s robocar testing. As of Friday night, the court had not yet unsealed Alsup’s decision on that, so stay tuned. Uber in Trouble Aarian Marshall and Alex Davies The Scariest Threats to Uber’s Future, From Waymo to Money Worries Dan Solomon One Year After Fleeing Austin, Uber and Lyft Prepare a Fresh Invasion Cade Metz Uber Hires an AI Superstar in the Quest to Rehab Its Future Laser Fight This brouhaha started when Waymo filed the suit on February 23. Waymo claims that Levandowski illicitly downloaded 14,000 technical files, included plans for Waymo’s lidar, the laser sensor that allows autonomous vehicles to “see.” The suit alleges that Levandowski took those documents with him when he quit in early 2016 and launched the autonomous trucking outfit Otto. Uber acquired Otto for $680 million in August and put Levandowski in charge of its robocar research. Waymo claims Levandowski used its intellectual property to accelerate Uber’s program, which started about four years after Waymo’s. Two weeks after filing the suit, Waymo sought a preliminary injunction forcing Uber to stop using any technology derived from its IP, including the lidar system. This could deliver a crushing blow to Uber’s R&D, because lidar is widely seen as fundamental to the type of vehicles Uber is working on. Alsup was impressed by the evidence Waymo presented. “You have one of the strongest records I’ve seen for a long time of anybody doing something that bad,” Alsup said during a hearing last week. “Good for you.” Of course, that doesn’t mean Uber is guilty of anything, but it was enough to convince Alsup to refer all of that evidence, along with everything Uber’s counsel has gathered in the case, to the US Attorney’s office in San Francisco. We’re talking terabytes of information. You can be sure that federal prosecutors will scrutinize it all. “If you get a referral, and I did get one or two in my career, you obviously take that very seriously,” says Toren. Related Video Climb Inside Uber’s Self-Driving Car—Its Next Big Disruption If the DOJ proceeds with a criminal investigation for economic espionage, a conviction for could mean a long prison stint for Levandowski. The market value of any stolen intellectual property weighs heavily in the sentencing calculus, says Toren. “If we’re talking about tens of millions of dollars in value, we’re talking about a very, very lengthy potential prison sentence,” says Toren. Those numbers aren’t outlandish. A recent Boston Global Consulting report estimates the autonomous vehicle market could be worth tens of billions of dollars a year by 2030. Every case is different, of course, but a man recently convicted of stealing $20 million worth of trade secrets received a 15-year sentence. None of this will happen quickly. Any criminal investigation will unfold slowly, and require cooperation from Waymo—which may not want to help. The company is already locked in a public battle over secretive tech, and helping the US Attorneys Office push a criminal case means ceding all control over what is disclosed and when. “It’s sort of like the adage of dancing with the bear: The dance isn’t over until the bear says it is,” says John Marsh, a lawyer who specializes in trade secrets litigation. (The federal government is the bear here.) The Lawsuit Rolls On Uber, however, may be just fine. Even if Levandowski is convicted of a crime, Waymo’s lawyers still must prove any stolen IP made its way into Uber’s technology. So far, it hasn’t connected those dots. “I’ve given you lots of discovery, and so far you don’t have any smoking gun,” Alsup told the company’s lawyers last week. A criminal investigation could help with that, though. Prosecutors might uncover evidence during discovery, and use the threat of of subpoenas or the promise of leniency to compel testimony. Plus, “people are much more mindful of the consequences of not being truthful with federal prosecutors than lawyers in a civil case,” says Marsh. And if Levandowski is convicted, Waymo’s lawyers could present that as evidence of wrongdoing by Uber—but you can bet Uber’s lawyers would fight against that. (That said, the odds of a conviction coming before the civil trial starts in October are long indeed.) Given that federal prosecutors are involved now, Uber almost certainly will bar Levandowski from any involvement in further R&D. That’s a setback for its research, but an even bigger setback for its image (not that the company needs much help there) and recruiting. Silicon Valley fetishizes “superstar” talent, and Levandowski is among the best in the business. If he’s driving a desk for the duration, it limits Uber’s ability to attract talent, says Jonathan Matus, CEO of mobile data analytics company Zendrive. “People might ask themselves more questions than they would otherwise,” he says. He is bullish on Uber’s ability to bounce back, but there’s a lot at stake here. Failure to deliver self-driving tech poses an existential threat to Uber in the long run. Anyone getting there first, could offer a far cheaper rival service by eliminating the need to pay human drivers. “What would happen if we weren’t a part of that future? If we weren’t part of the autonomy thing? Then the future passes us by,” CEO Travis Kalanick told Business Insider last year. But moving forward is hard with federal prosecutors circling your offices. Go Back to Top. Skip To: Start of Article. corporate espionage department of justice Uber Waymo Skip Social.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Mobile Image Source: YouTube Android O could solve Android’s biggest problem Jacob Siegal @JacobSiegal May 12th, 2017 at 9:03 PM Share Tweet For all of Android’s strengths, there’s one area where it has dramatically lagged behind iOS: updates. Fragmentation is arguably Android’s biggest problem, but in a post on the Android Developers Blog this Friday, Google revealed a new feature in Android O that will supposedly “make it easier, faster and less costly for manufacturers to update devices to a new version of Android.” Don't Miss: You can’t stop people from calling you on your Amazon Echo Google says that the new feature, dubbed Project Treble, represents “the biggest change to the low-level system architecture of Android to date.” As it stands, a lot of code has to be rewritten across Android before a given vendor can update its devices to the latest version of the software. With Project Treble, vendors will be able to roll out Android updates without having to wait for chip manufacturers such as Qualcomm to modify the code to work with their chips. The entire process will be streamlined so that vendors can get Android 8.0 (and beyond) in the hands of consumers more quickly than they’ve been able to in the past. That’s what Google is promising, anyway. Google has not been blind to the fragmentation issue over the past several years. The company has ensured Android users on multiple occasions that it’s working on solutions, but considering that just 7.1% of users are on Android 7.0 Nougat while nearly 20% are still on Android 4.4 KitKat, the success on this front has clearly been limited up to this point. Google says that Project Treble is already running on the Android O Developer Preview for Pixel phones, but we’ll have to wait until the new version of Android begins rolling out to judge its efficacy.

Google's latest attempt to get makers of Android phones and tablets to roll out updates faster is called Project Treble, and it's intended to remove an entire category of partners from the update pipeline. Treble, announced on Friday ahead of next week's Google I/O developers conference, will make it possible for device manufacturers like Samsung and Motorola to push OS updates to their users without waiting for an updated version of the firmware that controls the devices' chipsets. Android is an open source operating system, so phone makers are free to modify and test it to suit their hardware. That means it looks very different on each mobile device that runs it. Since Pixel phones are designed and supported by Google, they run a version of the OS with few modifications. Meanwhile, Motorola also installs skin-less versions of Android on its phones, while Samsung and Amazon tweak their version of the OS to the point that it barely resembles the version running on the Pixel. Related The Best Android Phones of 2017 The Best Android Phones of 2017 Every time there's an update, the companies not only have to ensure that it works with their modified version, but they also have to wait for chip makers like Qualcomm to ensure that it's compatible with the phone's modem, processor, and other components. Finally, they have to work with the mobile carriers to push out an update. That lengthy process means Android is woefully fragmented compared to iOS, a fragmentation that reportedly makes Google quite upset. Just 7 percent of Android users are running the latest version, Android 7.0, compared to 79 percent of iOS users who are running iOS 10. By removing the chip makers from the update process, Google hopes to speed it up. Major chip makers like Qualcomm and Sony are already on board with the Treble project, and Google says that it will roll out with the next version of Android, codenamed Android O.

Zeman   @phonescooper Google today announced Project Treble, which it hopes will solve the pain of updating smartphones to the latest version of Android. As it stands today, the process is multifaceted and includes a number of moving players, including Google, silicon makers, manufacturers, and carrier partners. The complexity of all the pieces translates into lots of time and money for the ecosystem to test, certify, and release new system builds for existing phones. Project Treble, which will work with Android O and subsequent versions of Android, rearranges how the operating system is configured at a base level in order to simplify the process. "The core concept is to separate the vendor implementation — the device-specific, lower-level software written in large part by the silicon manufacturers — from the Android OS Framework. This is achieved by the introduction of a new vendor interface between the Android OS framework and the vendor implementation. The new vendor interface is validated by a Vendor Test Suite, analogous to the CTS, to ensure forward compatibility of the vendor implementation." Put more plainly, device makers will be able to update their devices to newer versions of Android underneath their custom UI without disturbing it, and without requiring help from silicon manufacturers. Google says some aspects of Project Treble are already included in the Developer Preview of O running on Pixel phones. The company plans to work with its silicon and device partners to ensure a smooth transition to the new architecture for future phones. Google expects to release full details of Project Treble with the launch of Android O later this summer. more info at Google » Related Oppo Makes Near-Stock Android Available to Some Phones Oppo today began offering customers an alternative to its ColorOS.

It's interesting how Google is racing to add basic features and capabilities and better integration at the "one core" level like Windows 10 and Windows Phone/Windows 10 Mobile have had for awhile, and at the same time, Microsoft is adding features and capabilities to be more like Google (Windows 10 S vs Chromebook). Not quite sure what Apple is up to, but the competition between Microsoft and Google is a good thing for us consumers. reply     Page  1  of 1 Tweet this Follow @phonescoop on Twitter Email this Subscribe to news & reviews with RSS     Subscribe to Phone Scoop News with RSS Follow @phonescoop on Twitter Phone Scoop on Facebook Subscribe to Phone Scoop on YouTube Follow on Instagram   About Contact Terms of Use All content Copyright 2001-2017 Phone Factor, LLC.

(Angelo Merendino/Agence France-Presse via Getty Images) By Elizabeth Dwoskin By Elizabeth Dwoskin May 12 Follow @lizzadwoskin SAN FRANCISCO — The stakes are getting higher in a trade secrets case that pits two of Silicon Valley’s biggest companies against each other in a battle over the future of self-driving cars. A judge asked federal prosecutors Thursday to investigate whether Uber Technologies and one of its executives colluded to steal key technology from Google’s self-driving car project, now known as Waymo, before the executive joined Uber last year. The possibility of an investigation adds to mounting issues facing Uber and its embattled chief executive, Travis Kalanick. The ride-hailing giant, which is valued by private investors at nearly $70 billion, is also facing a criminal probe by the Justice Department over the company’s use of software that was designed to evade authorities in cities where Uber was not yet legal. That criminal investigation is ongoing, according to people familiar with the matter. “It is very rare for a judge to refer a matter over to the U.S. attorney and signals the judge’s displeasure with Uber in the trade secrets civil lawsuit,” said Carl Tobias Williams, chair in law at the University of Richmond School of Law. It also compounds Uber’s other legal problems, he said in an interview Friday. In referring the case to the U.S. attorney’s office, the court took “no position on whether prosecution is or is not warranted, a decision entirely up to the United States Attorney,” U.S. District Judge William Alsup wrote. In addition, Alsup denied Uber’s request to move the case to arbitration. That means the high-profile case is expected to go to public trial later this year. Waymo filed the lawsuit in February. Alsup also temporarily blocked part of Uber’s self-driving program using technology that Waymo claims to be stolen, but it was unclear how much of the program would be suspended because documents of the partial injunction were sealed. Uber did not respond to multiple requests for comment. Waymo commented on the decision to go to trial in an emailed statement Thursday: “This was a ­desperate bid by Uber to avoid the court’s jurisdiction. We welcome the court’s decision today, and we look forward to holding Uber ­responsible in court for its misconduct.” Uber has long been celebrated in Silicon Valley for its hard-charging culture — and for its strategy of moving into cities ­before getting permission from authorities. Within the tech world, Uber’s success was emblematic of the promise of a new wave of “on-demand” start-ups that would use smartphone-based technology to transform entrenched businesses in the physical world. Technology companies Uber and Waymo, along with Detroit automakers, are in a cutthroat race to develop self-driving technology, which they think could define the future of transportation in the United States. Uber executive Anthony Levandowski allegedly downloaded 14,000 documents to his personal computer before quitting his job last January as an executive with Google. Waymo claims that Uber colluded with Levandowski to steal lidar technology, a laser that helps software gauge the proximity of objects. Levandowski recently stepped aside as the head of Uber’s self-driving car program, though he remains with the ­company. Google, which launched a self-driving program in 2009, now has a fleet of more than 100 test vehicles that have driven 3 million miles on city streets in Phoenix, Austin and Mountain View, Calif. (The testing rules require that autonomous vehicles have humans in the car). Uber began testing autonomous technology seven years later. The ride-hailing company has cars in San Francisco, Pittsburgh and Tempe, Ariz. For privately held Uber, self-driving vehicles have the potential to cut the expense of human drivers; lowering such costs is seen by some investors as a prerequisite for a public offering. Losing the race to develop the technology first would make Uber vulnerable to competitors and potentially decimate its business. And the company’s culture has been called into question this year. Uber has seen a string of high-profile executive departures following a controversy over sexual harassment and discrimination. The earlier criminal probe focuses on software developed by Uber called Greyball. The program helped the company evade officials in cities where Uber was not yet approved. The software blocked rides to transportation regulators who were posing as Uber customers to prove that the company was operating illegally. The company said it was used to deny ride requests from fraudulent users. business economy true Please provide a valid email address. Sign up You’re all set!

An update rolling out today to Google Maps is making it even easier to arrive smoothly at your destination by allowing users to see exactly where to turn and what lane to be in using Street View images… UAG Samsung Galaxy S8 Cases First noticed by Android Police, version 9.52.2 of Google Maps introduces several design tweaks including the addition of the Street View images. The biggest downside of this new feature is the fact that it isn’t available when you’re using navigation. Street View images only appear after you’ve inputted your destination and before you tap on start. At the bottom of the screen, you can select route info which will populate a list of step-by-step directions accompanied by small image thumbnails. Only by clicking on the thumbnail will the full-sized Street View image appear. While this can be helpful before you start your trip, it would be more useful if the picture popped up right before you had to make a turn so that you could see exactly where you needed to be heading. Also in this update is a small change to the bottom navigation bar. This change makes the section slightly larger than the outgoing design, but it does make everything a little more intuitive for users. For example, instead of assuming that someone knows that swiping up offered additional options, Google has now labeled a button as “More info.” The latest version of Google Maps is rolling out now on the Google Play Store. If you don’t want to wait for it to hit your device, you can download the APK for version 9.52.2 from APKMirror. Make sure to read our guide on manually installing APKs if you need any help.

Off the Grid News – by Sean Shado When Google Earth first debuted in 2005, privacy advocates reacted by overwhelmingly rejecting the new satellite imagery platform. Google Earth provides the public with the ability to access satellite pictures of any coordinates just by simply dragging the mouse. This gross invasion of privacy can involuntarily give the world a glimpse at your home, your belongings and your surroundings. Google Street View pushed the boundaries of personal privacy even further by providing a street-side picture of your home or business for the world to see.   In some circumstances, Google Earth and Street View are tools that have immensely helped people gain their bearing in a foreign place. Defenders of Google Earth and Street View argued that regulations surrounding satellite and street view images being posted on the Internet made it difficult for malicious people to get anything of value from the images. These regulations required that some portions of the pictures be blurred out. Other regulations mentioned that certain photography resolution thresholds must not be breached. While these regulations seemed like a fair compromise, the United States government has instituted a change which suddenly loosened the regulations surrounding satellite imagery policies. These loosened regulations have resulted in companies such as Google now being able to display ultra-high definition photographs in near real-time, online – displaying resolution as small as one foot. In fact, Google recently acquired Skybox imaging for $500 million in order to jumpstart its live satellite imagery endeavors. Skybox’s plan is to have 24 satellites circling the earth at all times by 2018. Wired magazine notes that “With six small satellites orbiting Earth, Skybox could provide practically real-time images of the same spot twice a day at a fraction of the current cost.” While this innovation could stand to become Google’s next billion dollar revenue stream, the model presents all kinds of problems for those who value privacy. The Impact of Ultra-High Resolution Satellite Imagery The notion of having a satellite being able to photograph your house with an ultra high resolution camera twice per day is the epitome of Big Brother. Subsequently having it broadcast on the Internet for the world to see is a gross invasion of personal privacy. If you live in a densely populated urban area, you may have more than two pictures per day being published online. Real time high definition satellite imagery will definitely be helpful if you must navigate against heavy rush hour traffic in an urban area. Those who enjoy living on the grid can see obvious advantages for this technology. Privacy-minded individuals have an entirely different perception of Google Skybox. While current images on Google Maps can display images of your house and car, Skybox can show detail about your house and car – for instance, if you have a satellite dish, if you have a mailbox, what you’re eating at that outdoor picnic (pizza?), and even how many children are playing in your yard. And it can do this virtually in real-time. “If you imagine a satellite sat above your office then the old resolution could probably make out your desk. The new imagery – where each pixel measures around 31 centimeters (12 inches) – can now make out what’s on your desk,” Clive Evans, lead satellite imagery investigator with LGC Forensics, told the Independent. “When you reach this sort of frequency you can begin to add in what we call ‘pattern of life’ analysis. This means looking at activity in terms of movement – not just identification.” Image source: DailyTech.com Let’s face it: Google SkyBox is a dream come true for the criminal underworld. Any stalker, burglar or any other sort of criminal now has instant access to a frequently updated aerial feed of your home. A sophisticated group of criminals could theoretically target your home using data gathered from the ultra high resolution satellite photos being published by Google. Instead of driving through your neighborhood, criminals could canvass your house daily without ever stepping foot inside your neighborhood. Sophisticated criminals could potentially be able to determine when you are normally at home or when you’re typically away. Criminals who are able to take an analytical approach to this intrusion of privacy could even canvass your entire neighborhood and base their attacks on all the data they have accumulated. Seedy individuals from the underworld can build databases that tell them when your neighbors are typically at home and when they are away. These efforts are used to determine when the least amount of people will be at their homes during certain periods of time. This gives criminals a time window of when they can show up and perform their malicious intentions while minimizing their risks of being seen or caught. The loosened regulations on satellite images can give anyone an amazing amount of detail on the area they have selected on the map. Experts mention that they are able to examine the high resolution pictures taken by SkyBox satellites and determine the make and model of vehicles that are sitting in parking lots. Governments and Big Corporations Want The Data, Too This creepy new technology supersedes any privacy fears that consumers held against Google Maps back in 2005. These real time public images can become key data points that indicate more granular details about places around the world, including the economic health within a specific region. Corporate executives who have chosen to remain nameless have admitted that they have already begun devising methods to make use of this data.   Governments all around the world – even small countries with no satellites — will now have access to a rich continuous stream of events happening in real time. With SkyBox’s high resolution satellite on the cheap option, these smaller countries can now monitor events as they happen rather than having to rely on unconfirmed reports from senior officials or news agencies. Nations such as the US stand to gain little from Google’s endeavors because the US government already possesses this technology. The only difference is that SkyBox costs a fraction of what the government paid to develop technology of this same caliber. The data that Google SkyBox brings to the table is clearly game-changing because it ensures that an up-to-date high resolution picture of a home or business is being broadcast online for anyone to see. If you do not want your home or property on it, it may be possible – once it is rolled out — for you to ask Google to blur out your property on search results. This option was available in the original Google Earth. Only time will tell. http://www.offthegridnews.com/privacy/googles-newest-high-res-satellites-can-monitor-your-every-move-in-real-time/ Share this: Print Email Share on Tumblr Tweet Pocket This entry was posted in News.

The headline is an exaggeration, at least for now. Long version: *** Wired magazine notes that “With six small satellites orbiting Earth, Skybox could provide practically real-time images of the same spot twice a day at a fraction of the current cost.” *** I’m not sure what “real-time, twice a day” means. Most likely what’s happening is each satellite is taking still images at some constant rate as it flies around the earth — maybe one snapshot every several minutes? Some of those shots may overlap a bit. But twice per day isn’t very often, and short flyover time is a major weakness of satellite surveillance. For example, if a satellite is orbiting at the equator twice per day, the area being imaged on the ground is traveling at about 2000 mph. Even if that imaging area is huge, you won’t be under it for long. 12-inch resolution? That’s actually pretty terrible. No way are they going to be able to distinguish one person from another with that. They might not even be able to see people at all, or at least not reliably. You’re talking about every pixel on the image being a 1-foot-by-1-foot block. Most people are only about 2 feet wide. These are the reasons why the Empire relies so much on drones and other aircraft for surveillance, even though it has satellites as well. Their satellites can’t loiter long enough, and they just can’t make out enough detail. The poor resolution is partly due to inherent limits in optics based on aperture size, and also due to atmospheric distortion, which I understand can only be partially corrected with adaptive optics. (This is why some astronomical telescopes have been put into space.) Cloud cover, too, can block visible light, though some satellites can take (STILL) photos through the clouds using imaging radar.

Name: Subject: Message: Android O’s Project Treble could lead to faster OS updates for smartphones Newsby John Callaham1 day ago 15 824 61 Some Android smartphones, even ones that are consider flagship devices, can be slow in receiving big OS updates. Today, Google announced an effort designed to speed up that device update process called Project Treble. It will be a part of the upcoming Android O operating system and in fact is already included in the current developer preview. See also: How stable is the first Android O Developer Preview? April 6, 2017 Google states that in current and previous versions of Android, any updates for the OS are first sent to silicon companies like Qualcomm, MediaTek and others, who make changes to the OS so it can work on their hardware. Then that version is sent to device makers like Samsung, LG, HTC and others, who make their own changes for their specific products. If a device is tied to a carrier, such as AT&T or Verizon, the OS update must then make their way to those companies for final changes and testing. This is why Android updates from Google can sometimes take months, or longer, to reach your smartphone. Google says having such an interface will give device makers direct access to the hardware-specific parts of Android O. With the launch of Android O, Google wanted to cut that update time with Project Treble. It has done this with the creation of a new vendor interface that will be between the Android OS framework and the vendor implementation. What does this mean? Google says having such an interface will give device makers direct access to the hardware-specific parts of Android O. In theory, this should allow those companies to update their Android smartphones and tablets directly, without the need to go through their silicon partners first. In addition to Project Treble, Google is also working with its Android device hardware partners to directly implement any of their code changes into the common Android Open Source Project (AOSP) codebase. This means that when a new version of Android O is released, those code changes won’t need to be patched by those companies. All of this sounds extremely promising, especially if you buy a phone and then have to wait a long time for promised OS updates. Hopefully, these new moves by Google will speed up this process for Android O device owners. We will learn a lot more about Android O next week as part of the 2017 Google I/O developer conference.

Digital Trends TP-Link Deco M5 review TP-Link dives into mesh-based networking with its new $300 Deco M5 three-unit kit Share TP-Link's new Deco M5 mesh networking kit targets simplicity, but it’s half-baked. TP-Link's new Deco M5 mesh networking kit targets simplicity, but it’s half-baked. TP-Link's new Deco M5 mesh networking kit targets simplicity, but it’s half-baked. Highs Unique circular design Support for Ethernet-based Deco-to-Deco communication Lows Unstable Bluetooth mobile setup process No web-based backend Wireless AC devices have a 433Mbps limit Shallow “advanced” features DT Editors' Rating 4.0 Scores Explained Home > Product Reviews > Router Reviews > TP-Link Deco M5 review By Kevin Parrish Posted on 05.13.17 Research Center: TP-Link Deco M5 Mesh networking seemingly emerged in the retail space in the middle of 2016. It ignores the tried-and-true “bubble” wireless coverage offered by a single router, instead incorporating two or more units that can create a web of connectivity. That means there are no dead spots in the home, and since the tech’s debut, we’ve seen many solutions hit the market such as the Luma, Eero, and Google WiFi. Now TP-Link enters the arena with its Deco M5 kit. Someone is a fan of Star Trek The Deco M5 kit is a plug-and-play mesh-based networking kit aimed at customers looking for a simple solution that provides Wireless AC coverage in every corner of the house. The system is currently sold as a three-unit kit for $300, and each unit resembles the saucer section of the U.S.S. Enterprise, complete with a small light on top. There’s a raised area on the “back” of each unit that hosts two gigabit Ethernet ports and a Type-C power connector. A vent to dissipate the heat resides across the bottom surface. Each unit resembles the saucer sections of the U.S.S. Enterprise. Each unit also comprises of a quad-core processor and four internal antennas, promising throughput speeds of up to 400 megabits per second (Mbps) on the 2.4GHz band and up to 867Mbps on the 5GHz band. That roughly translates into two 200Mbps spatial streams (2.4GHz) and two 433Mbps spatial streams (5GHz). One small LED on top provides a visual indication of the Deco unit’s status. A solid green means everything is just peachy, red means trouble, orange shows the unit is in the boot process, blinking blue indicates Bluetooth setup readiness, and solid blue confirms a Bluetooth connection. Any of the three Deco units can be used as the wireless network hub, which in turns feeds all data to the remaining two “satellite” units. What’s the obsession with Bluetooth setups? Unfortunately, setting up the Deco M5 system was a nightmare. As it turns out, creating a network using Bluetooth is a bad idea, and it’s not the first time we’ve encountered weird Bluetooth setup issues. TP-Link and its competitors should give customers a secondary option of connecting a PC directly to the hub or satellite for manual setup of the network environment, and our experience with the Deco M5 kit serves as a good example. At the start of the setup process, the LED located on top of the Deco M5 unit pulsed blue, indicating its readiness. We opened the app, tapped on the “Add” button, and swiped through a trio of instruction screens until we reached the “Deco’s LED is Pulsing Blue” stage. We tapped on that and our Android device connected to the Deco M5 unit using Bluetooth. Maybe. That’s where the fun began. With the mobile device seated next to the Deco M5 unit, the process would stop at any time, such as during the “Found it,” “Testing connection,” or “Optimizing your network” screens. At some point, the app would even suddenly say that the mobile device’s Bluetooth component wasn’t on, when that wasn’t the case at all. Instead, the Deco M5 unit suddenly rebooted itself for some reason as indicated by the orange LED. Eventually, when all three units created a stable networking environment, the app moved on to the process of creating a network name (SSID) and password. After that, we were greeted with a home screen displaying all three Deco devices, the download and upload speeds, and the number of devices connected to the new network. Yay. TP-Link Deco M5 Compared To Zmodo Beam Alert Netgear Orbi Synology RT2600AC Linksys WRT3200ACM Starry Station D-Link DIR-869 EXO AC1750 Portal Wi-Fi router Ubiquiti Amplifi HD HooToo TripMate Titan TP-Link AC3150 Linksys EA9500 Max-Stream AC5400 Zyxel NBG6815 AC2200 Netgear Nighthawk X4S Netgear Nighthawk X8 Google & TP-Link OnHub Simplicity arrives as a trio On the home screen, users will see an orange-yellow button in the bottom right corner that leads to a second window packing seven categories: Wi-Fi Settings, Parental Controls, Antivirus, QoS, Advanced, Update Deco, and Managers. Located on the top-left of the home screen is a menu button showing the account name, the available Deco-based networks (if you create more than one), an option to create a new network, a “help” section, and info about the app. Overall, TP-Link focuses on simplicity with the Deco M5 kit. The only “advanced” options provided to users are changing the internet connection type to match the ISP’s service (dynamic, static, and PPoE), turning the LED off at night, and toggling notifications for monthly reports, new device detection, and firmware updates. Setting up the Deco M5 system was a nightmare. Network creation over Bluetooth is a bad idea. On the QoS front, this section enables the user to enforce five pre-set modes: Standard, Gaming, Streaming, Surfing, and Chatting. There’s also a “custom” button, providing users with a second page and five sliders with Low, Normal, and High levels. Each slider addresses Gaming, Streaming, Surfing, Chatting, and Downloading. Built-in anti-virus functionality is provided in partnership with TrendMicro, enabling the Deco M5 system to scan incoming and outgoing traffic to filter malicious content, prevent intrusions, and prevent infected devices from transmitting sensitive information or “security threats” to other devices outside the network. These three features can be enabled/disabled together with a simple tap, or enabled/disabled individually using a toggle for each. As for parental controls, this section requires users to create a profile, assign a category to that profile (Child, Pre-Teen, Teen, and Adult), assign a connected device to the profile, and then choose what the Deco network should block. For instance, the Pre-Teen profile automatically blocks adult content, gambling, and social networking. Parents can even block specific media, downloads, games, and so on. There’s means for throttling device access to the network in one, two, and four-hour durations as well. Moving the load from a shuttle craft to a Galaxy-glass ship One of the Deco kit’s unique “secret” features is that users can move its Deco-to-Deco communication to a wired Ethernet connection. Kits like the Deco M5 and Eero are meant for whole-house coverage, but they share the same 5GHz connection as their client wireless devices, thus creating more congestion. That can put a damper on performance due to congested radio airspace. Theoretically, pushing the unit-to-unit communication to wired Ethernet provides a private backroad at up to 1Gbps, leaving more 5GHz space for wireless client devices to breathe. It speeds up the data transmissions passed from the wireless client device to the internet because the Deco-to-modem highway is wide open. What we learned by moving the backend to Ethernet is that owners can use the Deco M5 kit in several ways. First, users can daisy-chain the hub and satellite units together for Deco-to-Deco communication using the two gigabit Ethernet ports mounted on the back. Meanwhile, the wireless client devices connected to the network fight for attention on the mule-infested 5GHz space. While this might be a technical advantage, it also has a problem. No one wants to drape Ethernet cables throughout their house. A network of powerline Ethernet adapters might solve that. However, such work-arounds increase the complexity of the setup, and defeat the point of a simple mesh network. And there’s another annoyance. Deco M5 units must be completely reconfigured to use a 5GHz or Ethernet-based backend. They don’t automatically switch to 5GHz when users disconnect the Ethernet cord. That means if you’re moving to Ethernet, each unit must be reset by pressing the embedded button on the bottom with a paper clip. After that, you must endure the whole Bluetooth process again. Someone broke the warp drive At the time of this review, the Android-based Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge saw a maximum throughput speed of 433Mbps. Again, we know each Deco M5 unit is capable of two 2.4GHz streams at 200Mbps each and two 5GHz streams at 433Mbps each. Given the 433Mbps cap we experienced with this phone, we suspect the Deco M5 units were sending and receiving data through a single 433Mbps spatial stream. For the record, the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge is a 2×2 device, and can currently reach throughput speeds of around 750Mbps when connected to the competing Eero mesh networking kit, using two spatial streams. That said, here are the performance numbers for Windows 10 Creator’s Update using the default settings of iperf (85KB TCP window size), the default settings of the Deco M5, an AMD desktop with a gigabit LAN card (server), and a recent build of the Alienware 17 R4 laptop (client) with a Killer Wireless 1535 component using Qualcomm’s v12.0.0.296 driver (2/2017). Interval Bandwidth (Deco M5) Bandwidth (Eero) 0.0- 1.0 sec 64.8Mbps 125Mbps 1.0- 2.0 sec 81.2Mbps 139Mbps 2.0- 3.0 sec 68.2Mbps 141Mbps 3.0- 4.0 sec 81.1Mbps 134Mbps 4.0- 5.0 sec 76.7Mbps 131Mbps 5.0- 6.0 sec 87.0Mbps 130Mbps 6.0- 7.0 sec 77.5Mbps 129Mbps 7.0- 8.0 sec 86.4Mbps 126Mbps 8.0- 9.0 sec 73.3Mbps 135Mbps 9.0- 10.0 sec 71.5Mbps 141Mbps The numbers are clear. Compared to Eero, which is one of our favorite recent routers, the Deco falls short. It never reaches bandwidth remotely close to the Eero. We made one additional attempt to see throughput speeds on Windows 10 higher than 130Mbps, by pulling out an older Lenovo laptop with a dual-band Wireless N USB adapter from Trendnet (TEW-804UB). This excludes the possibility of a limitation in the Alienware laptop used for the test above. In a 10-second test, the Lenovo laptop saw even slower speeds between 26.7Mbps and 32.4Mbps. We also have Android to consider, which tells a similar tale. As previously stated, the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge only achieved 5GHz band speeds of up to 433Mbps on the Deco M5 network, even though it almost hits the theoretical maximum speed when connected to Eero. That said, there’s no sense of even testing older Android devices if a new smartphone with a Wireless AC 2×2 component can’t move beyond the 433Mbps limit. Warranty Customers must dig deep into TP-Link’s website to uncover the company’s Warranty & RMA Policy here. The warranty lasts for two years after purchase, and covers “failures due to defects in material or workmanship on devices, antennas and accessories.” As always, a proof of purchase and a serial number is required to receive any services under the warranty. Our Take TP-Link’s entry into the mesh networking industry may need more time to bake. We saw a portion of this before the product went live, but now that it’s in the hands of consumers, there appears to be plenty of kinks that still need to be ironed out. While the Wireless AC performance falls within the bottom half of the normal range, it falls short of what we saw with the Eero system. Don’t even get us started with the Bluetooth setup process. Is there a better alternative? The DT Accessory Pack TP-Link AV1200 Powerline Adapter $59.99 TP-Link 5-Port Gigabit Ethernet Switch $19.11 TP-Link AV1200 Powerline Adapter w/ Power Outlet Pass-through $74.99 TP-Link AC1200 Wireless Dual Band USB Adapter $28.50 In our most recent testing, the Eero setup is a performance champ when it comes to Wireless AC connectivity. It’s stellar on Android, and its numbers are in the higher range on Windows 10 PCs with a 2×2 Wireless AC component. Netgrear’s Orbi did rather well too although technically it’s not a mesh-based networking kit. Our overall favorite remains the Securifi Almond 3, which blends reasonable performance with strong smart home functionality. How long will it last? Mesh networking is here to stay for now, but hopefully companies will see that using Bluetooth to setup a network is just a horrible idea. What happened to the days of connecting directly to a router/hub wirelessly to set up the system? Why must mobile devices be the primary client for establishing a network? Customers who purchase the Deco M5 kit may wonder the same thing. Should you buy it? At this point, we can’t recommend this product. There are better performing, less aggravating, more robust solutions on the market today. Sure, the built-in anti-virus aspect is cool, but it’s outshined by the setup woes and performance issues. Perhaps TP-Link can clean up the outstanding issues with firmware and app updates.

March saw two rounds of serious flaws made public by Google’s Tavis Ormandy (quickly fixed), which seemed like a lot for a single week. Days ago, news emerged of a new issue (also fixed) in the company’s two-factor/two-step authentication (2FA) security. To coin a phrase, all serious flaws are serious – but some are more serious than others. This one matters for two reasons, only one of which will sound flippant: it wasn’t discovered by Tavis Ormandy, who at times has seemed to be writing a novella on flaw-hunting with the company’s name on it. That’s fine – researching vulnerabilities is his day job, after all. Another researcher with a taste for LastPass, researcher Martin Vigo, uncovered the latest issue, and it’s the 2FA bit of the story that explains the angst. Sophos Home Free home computer security software for all the family Learn More Two-factor authentication (a term that also refers to more convenient but less secure two-step verification) matters because it is the crown jewels of everyday security, especially for password managers such as LastPass. It represents a safety blanket that stops an attacker gaining access to the vault even if they get hold of the master password. While it’s possible to use LastPass without 2FA enabled it’s not recommended, indeed the wide variety of two-factor and two-step options is one of the service’s best features. The flaws are explained by Vigo in a slightly confusing way (one compromise was subsequently shown not to be exploitable) but cover overlapping weaknesses that might under specific circumstances allow 2FA to be bypassed when using Google’s Authenticator and QR codes. The detail here is less relevant than the fact that Vigo found chinks in the armour of something highly sensitive to even the tiniest compromise. LastPass’s response was to point out the conditions necessary for a successful attack: First, the attacker would have had to lure a user to a nefarious website. True, but hardly an impossible undertaking for someone already armed with the user’s master password. Second, the user would have to be logged in to LastPass at the time of visiting the malicious site. This combination of factors decreases the likelihood that a user might be impacted. Again a user being logged into LastPass at the time of an attack is entirely possible. Significantly, LastPass quickly stopped using the login hash (used to authenticate the master password without having to know it) to retrieve Authenticator’s QR codes, and now sets a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) token to plug another weakness. We still don’t know why LastPass has been plagued by so many issues in such a short space of time – perhaps it’s just a big-name target worth researching – but some of these weaknesses appear to be in its design, the result of decisions to do things in a certain way, probably some years in the past. Vigo has been paid a bug bounty and, for now at least, LastPass’s 2FA design is back in equilibrium. It’s just the nerves of its users that are a bit shot.

(@trmark321) says: April 26, 2017 at 1:49 pm LP works. LP is easy. LP is cheap. LP has features. LP fixes bug. LP is staying up-to-date. LP is better than Excel for storing passwords. Reply Nathanael says: April 26, 2017 at 2:21 pm “LP is better than Excel for storing passwords.” Being better than the second most insecure way of storing your passwords is hardly a measure of an effective password manager. (the most insecure obviously being a sticky note stuck to the keyboard/monitor) Reply Mark Stockley says: April 26, 2017 at 6:19 pm The post-it on my monitor is literally invulnerable to CSRF attacks : ) Reply Don Funkhouser says: April 26, 2017 at 7:17 pm Since I live alone and no one besides me has access to my home anything on a sticky note is about as safe as it can get. And a spreadsheet or text document on an air gapped computer at my home is just as secure. Reply KH says: May 13, 2017 at 11:48 pm …until someone physically breaks in, of course. ;-) Reply Carla says: April 26, 2017 at 4:56 pm My nerves are certainly shot. What’s a good free alternative? Reply John E Dunn says: April 26, 2017 at 5:51 pm KeePass is the obvious open source alternative (and also allows an encrypted local directory of passwords). Reply Jaosn Scott says: April 26, 2017 at 5:36 pm Happy to keep using LastPass. Interest from security researchers leads to a more secure product. Reply Mark Stockley says: April 26, 2017 at 6:34 pm It’s a fine line isn’t it. In some ways this is good, or at least not as bad as it looks, because LastPass is being harshly tested and could well emerge stronger. Indeed LastPass is to be congratulated for offering bug bounties that invite this kind of scrutiny and negative publicity. Of course if this rate of bug discovery is maintained for several months then eventually we might have to conclude that we’re dealing with another Flash or IIS 5. Reply Dominic Batstone (@DominicBatstone) says: April 28, 2017 at 10:19 am I found a small bug, where clicking a particular button (to unlink a personal account from a enterprise account) didn’t work. I reported it and they fixed it within about 5 hours. At first I though “amazing”, but when I thought about it, not having simple regression tests to click every button to try each feature is pretty bad. What else doesn’t get tested? Reply LIieilr says: April 29, 2017 at 9:11 am Literally everything. The user interface is horrible. Animations don’t work properly, everything seems designed in paint with only the “rectangle” and “fill” tools, and I was hitting a non-properly-working feature every day when I used it. The service is very cheap but you get what you paid for, it seems. Reply hyperar says: May 10, 2017 at 8:15 pm I wonder when will you take back recommending LastPass as a good Password Manager. I can’t even begin to understand why won’t you recommend KeePass instead, free, open source, not cloud based so no could security vulnerabilities and you can sync it to your mobile platform with your could file storage of your choice.

Anne McElvoy The NHS malware case highlighted the need to deal with the necessity of digital records and security Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email View more sharing options Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Close Saturday 13 May 2017 19.06 EDT At a session with Google geeks at their ZeitgeistMinds meeting last week, someone asked how long would it be before the kind of hacks we have seen hit governments’ security services came home to people in their daily lives. As if by malware magic arrived news of Friday’s major cyber-attack, whose victims included a large number of NHS organisations. It is a safe bet that if you have thought of a bad scenario, it is probably on the way to happening. But beyond a quick fix of Windows updates by sleepy NHS trust IT managers, this onslaught illustrates a trend policymakers and governments need to heed and communicate far better. Largescale hacks shake faith in data protection. Yet in all the exchange of blows on NHS funding and the moribund argument about reforming a health system that relies so heavily on IT to function, no politician has dealt extensively with the tension between digitisation and security. Google gets a bad rap these days, often fairly, for its stubborn tin ear on the effect of its advertising model on the future of responsible journalism and the tendency to want to solve all the world’s woes, except the ones it is directly involved in. But it is thinking more intelligently about cyber-threats and their impact on policy and politics than many in the sector. Other big platforms and providers need to think more strategically about how risks will evolve and their impact. This time, the National Security Agency will come in for the usual criticism for a policy of “back-door” access to big tech systems, a continuum of Barack Obama’s cyber-security policy, which relied heavily on this as its main defensive option. The NSA habitually assumes too readily that its own secrets are secure, when they are patently not. But the real dangers of flashpoints are what one source compares to traditional hierarchies of warfare – big state actors, notably Russia, China and Syria, out to destabilise democracies, flanked by “warlords”, who control bits of cyber-territory and “mercenaries” involved for the money or kudos. I doubt that the drivers in the hack that hit the NHS are purely financial. They are often the result of a mindset that relishes shaming established powers and institutions, while the lack of effective sanctions emboldens them. In foreign policy and security, cyber-hacks are growing components of election races and the treatment of conflicts. The recent gas attack on the opposition in Syria was followed by a welter of disinformation, disseminated through social media, to “prove” that the obvious (and true) explanation – that Bashar al-Assad ordered the attack – was not so obvious at all. Moral relativists thrive on this stuff. There is some light in the darkness. The hack of the Emmanuel Macron campaign was offset, in part, by his team’s counterinsurgency approach, undermining the hackers’ work, disrupting it with distracting information and thus undermining its value. Who can remember now what the point was? Cyberwars are a new battlefield, but they respect some old rules. One is that being defensive is not enough. The other is that we, the public, need to be wise to the fact that attacks will happen, but that the hackers do not always prevail. “I am the Spirit of Eternal Negation,” boasts Mephistopheles in Goethe’s Faust. Today, he’d have been at the top of a malware organisation.

HTC U Ultra Review: Features, Specification, Design, Price. May 13, 2017 by Staff   Filed under Opinion, Tech/Internet, Weekly Columns Leave a Comment Like Like Love Haha Wow Sad Angry 1 Tweet (ThyBlackMan.com) The massive phone HTC U Ultra stands out on many fronts. With the massive phone, HTC has made a huge change in its smartphone series. The U Ultra features a brand new build and design, strategic dual display, powerful cameras, 3D sound and fingerprint sensor. But is it worth buying? What’s inside this HTC smartphone? Here you’ll find all the answers in this HTC U Ultra review. Since its launch, the U Ultra is getting great attention because of its rich features and specifications. The eye-catching new design and dual display make the phone different than almost all the other leading smartphone models available in the market. The 5.7-inch Quad HD primary display and an additional 2-inch display located just above it are the major attractions for the phone. If you think that a secondary display is just useless since you can drag the top notification bar down and access the settings, the secondary display of U Ultra is more than what you think. Strategically integrated with apps, contacts and settings such as turning on or off Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and flashlight is easier than you think. You can check the location-based information such as weather and several other widget-like settings from the secondary display. Seamless integration with apps like Google Calendar is really amazing and accessing these apps looks flawless as they are greatly integrated with the phone’s UI. The best thing is that you won’t need to open up the phone’s primary menu. Fingerprint sensors are not anything unique in today’s phones. But the fingerprint sensor in the new HTC U Ultra is very responsive and swift. You can save up to 5 different fingerprints. The sensor has 360-degree readability so you can record fingerprints at any angle. You can also expect the fingerprint sensor to be extremely accurate. Google Assistant is available for a majority of smartphones these days, but here HTC has incorporated its own artificial intelligence based assistant, HTC Sense Companion. The AI assistant features a built-in voice recognition system which you can use for voice commands such as making calls, sending messages and for flawless navigation as well. The program recognizes your voice and improves user experience by giving recommendation on nearby attractions and also for traffic. The HTC U Ultra features four highly sensitive omnidirectional microphones. They capture sound from multiple directions while you are speaking, recording audio and video. As a result, you get 360-degree audio experience. The company’s USonic earphones optimize user’s’ listening experience by using the company’s signature USonic audio platform that adapts the sound and optimizes it well. It should be noted that the U Ultra doesn’t feature a 3.5mm audio jack, but supports USB Type-C. The new U Ultra, like its predecessor comes with many camera features. The phone is a lot capable. According to HTC, the U Ultra’s camera is highly improved one and surpasses the quality of HTC 10. The phone’s primary 12MP camera features face detection and laser autofocus. One can easily record 4K videos with 3D audio support. Additionally, the phone’s camera features Optical Image Stabilization with Raw Capture that lets you save photos in different formats. As far as the phone’s dimensions are concerned, the U Ultra comes in a size 162.41 x 79.79 x 3.6 – 7.99mm. The mobile phone weighs in at 170grams. The smartphone comes in different colors including Brilliant Black, Sapphire Blue, and Ice White. The device runs on Android Nougat and is powered by Snapdragon 821 chipset. It comes with a storage capacity of 64GB and 4GB RAM. The price of the HTC U Ultra is at the all-time low now. As per many reports, the company is planning a big announcement for the year and it is apparently going to happen anytime soon. So, as a part of this, the price of this smartphone has been cut down in many markets around the world. In Russia itself, the phone is being sold at 10 percent less than its price tag. On the company’s official website, the phone is listed with a price tag of US$749. Staff Writer; Corey Shaw Have any Tech Tips? News? Hit up our Tech Guru at; CoreyS@ThyBlackMan.com.

I have met an entrepreneur named Andrei Davidovich. He's started several companies since his first in 1998, including a software company, a marketing agency, a publishing company, etc. He says it takes 5 days to create a new company in Russia. davidswanson.org (Image by davidswanson.org)   Permission   Details   DMCA - Advertisement - He gives U.S. friends thanks for technology, research, and knowledge. He tells the U.S. government thanks for nothing. Davidovich has been in touch for years with the U.S.-based Center for Citizen Initiatives, the excellent organization that can bring you to Russia to learn all about it, and that brought some 6,000 Russian businessmen and women, including Davidovich, to the U.S. during the previous cold war. davidswanson.org (Image by davidswanson.org)   Permission   Details   DMCA - Advertisement - He has also created a highly successful online activist platform for creating citizen initiatives, now being used in 520 Russian cities. The name of the website translates as citizen.ru. Davidovich says an inspiration was the U.S. site SeeClickFix.com. The Russian site works in partnership with a Russian equivalent of Google (and Davidovich says that Google wanted to take his platform Europe-wide but cannot because of U.S. sanctions on Russia). The Russian site makes use of a law that requires government officials to respond to public concerns within 30 days (and of the public's willingness to make a virtual piÃ±ata of those who fail to do so). On the site, you identify your location and post a problem you want fixed. Your post may be grouped with others in a category (or may be blocked if not serious, appropriate, etc.). But if others support your post, and if the media covers it, you may end up bringing a great deal of public pressure to bear. davidswanson.org (Image by davidswanson.org)   Permission   Details   DMCA On Friday, says Davidovich, he heard from officials in Irkutsk demanding to know how he could dare to create a project making a demand of them, and have it in the newspaper, without having obtained permission first. Davidovich says he replied: "When Facebook appeared on computers in Irkutsk, did Zuckerberg ask your permission?" Once Davidovich received an email from a village in Crimea that had not had clean water ever, not when it had been part of the USSR, not when it had been part of Ukraine, and not since rejoining Russia. This email was thanking Davidovich for the village now finally having good water. Stories like that one could fill hours, he says. - Advertisement - davidswanson.org (Image by davidswanson.org)   Permission   Details   DMCA This entrepreneur extraodinaire said many mayors and town governments are resistant to public engagement and do not want any bad publicity, but others are lining up to actively work with his project, presenting the problems raised by the public in government meetings in order to address them. Davidovich is quite an opponent of President Vladimir Putin, yet was asked to make a presentation to the Public Chamber, a sort of advisory group created by Putin. The presentation was well received. People in Putin's government now use his project. And other groups make use of its open-source code. davidswanson.org (Image by davidswanson.org)   Permission   Details   DMCA Davidovich, who says that he does not like Putin, and who has posts on Facebook opposing Putin, does say that U.S. sanctions have brought him closer to Putin, and that he will unite with Putin until the sanctions end, and then return to criticizing him. "The sanctions do not affect Putin; they affect me," says Davidovich, who cannot sell to the U.S. On the other hand, he says, he's very happy that Dell and Cisco cannot sell to Russia. (And when they do return to Russia, he promises to blow the whistle on any corruption they engage in.) davidswanson.org (Image by davidswanson.org)   Permission   Details   DMCA I asked Davidovich whether the U.S. government shouldn't have offered real assistance, something like the admittedly flawed Marshall Plan, to Russia in the 1990s. Davidovich said he'd rather not have any of the sort of help that the U.S. did offer, sending people over to bribe and corrupt, sending the IMF with abusive loan terms, etc. As with many Russians (and of course many Americans as well) I found myself in great agreement on a large percentage of what this man had to say -- right up until he declared "I like Trump. I like his way of thinking. He is a real man. He is a business man!" Laugh? Cry? If we had a law requiring that our demands be met in 30 days, Trump would have 29 left in office. I hope we work that out somehow, but if Trump can do anything good for Russia between now and then I will be as pleased as anyone. And if I manage to discern a "way of thinking" in his statements I will be extremely delighted.   - Advertisement - View Ratings | Rate It http://davidswanson.org David Swanson is the author of "When the World Outlawed War," "War Is A Lie" and "Daybreak: Undoing the Imperial Presidency and Forming a More Perfect Union."

Abandoned By Google, Nexus 10 Finds Its Marshmallow Groove With New CyanogenMod 13 Nightly Rita El Khoury Follow View All Posts 2016/01/09 6:00am PDTJan 9, 2016 306 Plus 1 on G+ 80 Share on Facebook 0 Share on Twitter Total Shares386 News Nexus 10 CyanogenMod has been breathing fresh and 'mallow-tasting air into the lungs and ROMs of abandoned devices. The Galaxy S III practically returned from the dead after receiving the kiss of the CM 13 nightly, the Nexus 4 that was left behind by Google strapped on its big boy shoes and sprinted to the new version, and now it's the Nexus 10's turn to receive some chest compressions and get resurrected. Despite being abandoned by Google in its round of official Marshmallow updates, the Nexus 10 is still a decent tablet that's loved by many of its owners. Spec-wise, it's no Pixel C, but it does have an awesome and big screen that makes it perfect for media consumption. For many Nexus 10 users, there's no reason to buy a new tablet, except for the lack of official updates. Well, unless they get their hands a little dirty and decide to flash a custom ROM. That's where the new CM 13 nightly comes into play. It isn't the first Marshmallow ROM to hit the tablet, but it's the first official CyanogenMod one. Of course, the caveat is that this is a nightly so it isn't stable yet. And you'll need to flash the Gapps package separately. But at least you'll be taking your tablet where Google wouldn't dare go, and that's surely a good thing if you're adventurous. Grab the 250MB+ file from the CyanogenMod link below and get flashing.

KarloVranjes I can tell you this.Yes its great to see CM on those old Nexuses.But CM is piece of unstable things. I used several (STABLE) releases and still it would crash and freeze.You can say whatever you want but stock ROM was stable and CM neve was. So i would leave this CM crap and stick to other ROMs. meijin3 You can easily say the same thing about a lot of oem software up to and including iOS. I feel like the smaller ROMs get a pass if they're unstable. Miku is Best Vocaloid 99% of other ROMs are based on CM sources, so you're gonna be having this CM anyway. KarloVranjes I dont care about other CM based ROMs.They are crappy. CM is crap i can tell you that. How was possible that one OmniROM is better and stable at beta versions then stable version of CM. Kids that make ROM are using CM base and this is not good. Miku is Best Vocaloid That's fine, that's what happens when you flash unofficial software, I also try to avoid CM but on some devices it is nigh impossible. Also, you should be more mature and not get assblasted by minute shit like this. You should also stop typing like a 10 year old. It makes my eyes hurt. grey Conversely, CM saved my Galaxy S2 LTE and 2012 Nexus 7 because the final official firmware left them in unusable condition. It was almost like getting a brand new phone for the S2. C64 Nothing can save the N7 2012, because it's a piece of crap. I know, because i own one Maxr1998 Yeah, it's sad Asus built in such crappy storage.. It's not that it always lags, but it's just so unreliable when you need it :( Blackstar Have you tried flashing the storage to F2FS? It made my N7 so much smoother that it's actually decent to use again. C64 Yes did that and that's a temporary solution. After a week or so it's crap again Blackstar That's unfortunate. I've been running it for about 6 months now and while I don't use my tablet often, it is leaps and bounds better than what it was before. I chalk the rest of its problems up to the fact that it's nearly 4 years old at this point and it's probably about time to start looking at the Nexus 9 or Pixel C or something. C64 After a year mine was fucked up. Not gonna buy another tablet. Got a note 3 and that is big enough for me Stupid_Sexy_Quilava You sure? I have a Nexus 9 and cm13 did wonders in the performance department KarloVranjes Good for you but not for me. CM is okay if its made for one device but people that are using CM base and reusing on other devices is crap. hnl Unofficial builds are also a different case. Huhster No it might be crap on your particular device but for many it's fantastic. You are not statistically relevant. C64 Yesterday i flashed temasek unofficial cm13 on my Note 3 and haven't found an issue yet. Official cm13 will probably never come to the Note 3. Note 3 was dropped on 5.0.1 by Samsung sproc Probably turned off encryption :) JSo The sad thing is that there aren't very many other roms for the Nexus 10. At least not Marshmallow ROMs. Mikel Pr I've been running an omni 6.0 for like a week (and it has been very solid) Balázs Bulcsú Yeah, Omni ROM works fine on Nexus 10 Marshmallow. JSo So have I. Just saying options are limited Droid veteran It's ironic CM roms is much more stable than the stock one for me though, because there's no Google play services always running in my stupid background even though I'm not using any google apps on my stock rom. So AOSP> CM> stock google hnl Very strange. Have never tried any ROM as "stable" as CM. It could of course depend on the device. Kimberly Plummer ❝my neighbor's mate is getting 98$.

I d What an idiot. GA Manta is very funny codename. Do he know the Manta is polish smartphone manfaceter? Money Loo I do believe manta is Google's internal codename for the Nexus 10. GA No. You dont know about b-brands like Goclever, Pentagram, Wiko, Lark, Manta etc. EarlyMon Lark is a bird, manta is fish. AsterMK And it's the name of a fish, which Google codenames its devices after. Mako, hammerhead, bullhead, angler, manta etc. except shamu which is a whale (so, a mammal) but then again the Nexus 6 is huge so that's why. What's so hard to understand? EarlyMon Nexus devices are codenamed after fish. This is a manta - http://www.engineeringwellness.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/bigstock-Manta-flying-thru-water-5985799.jpg GA Lol. This is Manta logo EarlyMon Congratulations. It has nothing to do with why the Nexus 10 is called manta. Google "nexus (number) codename" - they're fish. GA Yeah. I have a Goclever tablet (model: TAB R721) and i play with a game called Hill Climb Racing. Its Manta tablet with Dual Core and 512MB RAM can too play this game. ASYOUTHIA ... GA Lol. and its a Goclever logo: Iain William Davidson Shamu (killer whale) Hammerhead (Shark) aren't fish atlouiedog Sharks absolutely are fish. EarlyMon OK, you got me on shamu. I could quote Moby Dick and go in to why old mariners called whales fish even when they knew full well that they weren't but let's let it go as you got me. Not sure if serious about hammerheads. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/c0f4b945503da62ea7e9431a9b2932ec22c747f74f05abf132bcae2ed824a252.png John Johnson Holy mother of statusbars EarlyMon Lmao to each his own, Android is all about choice. ReSiS Sharks ARE fish! d Uhm, absolutely no one knows Manta. Most people dont even know Poland. GA Lol. Search in Google "Manta MSP4507 Victory LTE" ndk Stock Android to CM, what a downgrade. mike__ch Already have been using an Omnirom nightly for several weeks on mine with great results, probably more stable than this CM build. Can't seem to figure out how to install it in a way that doesn't create a bunch of AOSP apps that I don't want, but that can be fixed with SU. SadAndroidFan Thanks to these people for keeping the device alive, and yet again google failed to update their own devices. So sad that google update policy stinks because this device is very capable to run the new os then again I would never trust google again, heck they can't even roll out the update same time between devices. pfmiller I've been disappointed several times by Google ending support for devices too soon (N1, Galaxy Nexus), but not for my N10. In fact based on Google's past history I was pleasantly surprised by the Lollipop update, I figured they would have ended support sooner. Bernhard Mähr There is since 3 moths a stable version of Marshmellow for the Nexus 10: http://forum.xda-developers.com/nexus-10/development/rom-marshmallow-nexus-10-t3222477 But I understand CM needs some more time to include their crapware and make the system instable. ivh Great screen?! Ha! It's possibly the worst screen I've ever seen on a mobile device, even my 5 years old sensation xl holds out better. Take a look at this: https://productforums.google.com/forum/m/?utm_medium=email&utm_source=footer#!msg/nexus/G0zLHMvjx9I/1JXuTpXDBQAJ After just two years and a few months, just after the warranty ended for most, the screen covered with a yellow glare for about 50-75% Great screen, of course. Denigrate The worst screen? Is it the third mobile device you've seen? Rhyme not really intended. pseudo But you left your comment open ended For a ryhming response that is splendid. pfmiller My N10 still looks great. YMMV Sin Jeong-hun (신정훈) Ha! The only reason I buy Nexus devices is that they are officially supported by CM. My Nexus 7 is still supported by Google as of yet, but I already have been using CM (13 nightly) on it. CM does show some glitches, but after a few nightlies I rarely find showstoppers. CM has everything Google's ROM has, and useful little features on top of that, why would I use Google's ROM? For example, volume button reorientation and always controlling multimedia volume are life-savers. Fatal1ty_93_RUS I'd say it's actually better to flash Remix OS for N10. Makes the exprience so much better jawsnnn I just installed CM12 on my N5 and have been surprised by how much better the battery life is compared to stock Marshmallow. Moose05 Development never stopped on the Nexus 10. These bums will release a buggy version as always. Plenty of better roms available, pass on this crap. Arcest Nexus devices are NOT recommended. randomdog It resurrected my verizon lg g pad and sg tab pro. Both are very stable, and quick. dark0mlks as a Nexus 10 user I must say that Google did not abandoned n10. In fact they supported the device more than they should. shonangreg What are you saying, Dark? pfmiller The Nexus 10 had great support from Google. I was pleasantly surprised by how long they updated it. digitalSlave My N10 was great until the last update. It was left with weird wireless network stack delays which makes it pretty much a joke to use. I can enter in a URL and pull my phone out of my pocket, enter the address, and have it rendered before my N10 can get there. This gives me hope. I have tried to re-flash but it ends up with the same issue. On another note other tech companies support their devices longer than Google and that makes me sad. Still a capable device. Nick Coad Did you try CM13? Did it fix it? pfmiller That sucks. I don't have any such delays on mine. Nick Coad digitalSlave's comment already covered this, but Google has left a crippling WiFi bug in play that has basically rendered my Nexus 10 useless. So yeah, fuck the way they handled the Nexus 10, it certainly did not receive "great support", it would be a stretch even to say it received mediocre support. Nick Coad Bullshit. The device has a crippling WiFi bug for many users that makes it basically useless and Google has provided no fix for it. I was completely turned off Android tablets by the way Google handled the Nexus 10. whyhateappreciate come on guys lets just be grateful that cyanogenmod are supporting our old devices stable or unstable at least they are trying and giving us newer versions of android thats what matters and you don't have to use cyanogenmod if you don't want but its nice to know there are options. Why has everyone gotta hate all the time lets just be grateful its free and there keeping our old devices alive if u don't like cm because u feel unstable then learn to code and build your own AOSP rom and make it stable so people can use yours and tell u its unstable :) THANKYOU CYANOGENMOD THANKYOU ALL DEVELOPERS I APPRECIATE WHAT YOUR DOING YOUR ALL AMAZING! F4uzan Other than the lack of punctuation, I have to agree with this. I don't care if the ROM is unstable or not, these ROM are made from user that gave it for free. What are you expecting from free stuff, if not some small glitches and bugs ? Zsolt V Are these the guys who are shilling Microsoft crapware? No, thanks. Simon No they aren't. Cyanogen Inc. != CyanogenMOD Mike Posting this from my Nexus 10 running CM13 and have yet to see an issue after the initial setup. Very happy so far with the added responsiveness. Zsolt V How about getting ads for Microsoft crapware? Prepagan I believe the ads only appear on Cyanogen OS, the operating system from the commercial operation. Cyanogenmod is still the community based operation it has been for years. Unfortunately, every time an article on cyanogenmod appears there are invariably commenters who are unable to differentiate between the two and take the opportunity to vent regarding their dislike of Cyanogen Inc. Zsolt V "invariably commenters who are unable to differentiate between the two " I wonder why that could possible be the case.... /s Mike Considering this is Cyanogenmod not CyanogenOS I haven't gotten a single one. Nice try though. josh rosales I'm having errors when flashing gapps. Which package did you use? AndryOID CM is great, I always use it on my nexus devices, even if they aren't old creed I dread the day that I have to look to cyanogen mod for the latest software on my nexus 6. Hopefully there will be a new nexus that I would want to upgrade to before then. HotelQuebec After 3 years of trying CM I finally gave up since there's always something broken. On any of the latest stable or nightly, YouTube stops playing after 6 seconds on every video with an error to touch the screen to retry. Stock Kit Kat is better than any CM. best essay services reviews Wow,this is great cm on nexuses. it so better than what i used at before. please tell us about the ROM stability Mike Bir I have tried to transfer the cm-13.0-20160820-SNAPSHOT-ZNH5YAO0J6-manta files to my Nexus 10 without any luck. It has wiped my system and has rendered my tablet dead, as it will not boot up. My PC can see my tablet and using Minimal ADB and Fastboot I can only transfer a boot.img or zip file but not the cm-13.0-20160820-SNAPSHOT-ZNH5YAO0J6-manta.img file, just gives me cannot open file. I have tried downloading other files as well and nothing seems to work. Is it time to go to Apple device? I loved the nexus 10 when it was working but with no more updates for security and the browsers started to crash very frequently ( I can only guess as a security issues ? ). If someone can tell me what I am doing wrong, I will give it another shot. But buying another tablet I would want one that will be supported longer than 3 yrs, Google has lost my faith.

Tweet I want to thank Google for adding even more steps to signing out of my Gmail account. It used to be one step: SIGN OUT. Voila! Then it went to 3 steps, and now it's FIVE fucking steps to sign the fuck out! Yes, I know what they're doing: As long as you remain logged in, or not completely signed out, they can track your web activity. Facebook does the same thing... oh sure, they say the tracking is anonymous, but if that was true, why on earth do I keep getting ads for toe fungus remedies? Yeah, I have toenail fungus... but that's something I've only emailed one person about. Are you telling me it's a coincidence that a day after I tell my friend about my toe fungus I start seeing ads for toe fungus medication? Yeah, right! Am I going to quit using Gmail? No. I'm forced to use it. I've been biting the pillow for Google for years now and I don't see an end to it anytime soon. Fuck it. And what's with the Mercury's comment profile section? I can't even add an avatar! It won't let me, I've tried countless times. There's this really funny photo of Trump making a hilarious/stupid face that I want to use as my Mercury avatar, but the Mercury won't let me. Now when I put Republican commenters/trolls in their place, I can't rub it in with a hilarious/stupid Trump face avatar. And who here remembers LoveLab? I Saw U? Like/Dislike comment option?

The site makes up fake news for Google traffic and social media shares. And that’s the same reason it’s naming Styles its “star of the week.” It’s not usual for an outlet to celebrate a particular star when they have a new project to promote. But HollywoodLies spent the last week trying to capitalize on Styles and his new album by peddling made-up stories. It culminated in the webloid pretending it didn’t tell any lies and sucking up to the superstar by awarding him a meaningless honor. This is how it breaks down: On Monday, the site claimed to know Styles’ feelings about a One Direction reunion. The story was posted in the wake of his “Today” show concert, during which he performed his new solo music. The article didn’t actually have any “exclusive” scoop. Rather, the online publication tried to pass off obvious information as if it were legitimately new revelations. What’s more, though, is Gossip Cop pointed out that Styles’ camp wouldn’t be talking with the webloid, anyway. That was followed on Tuesday by a story claiming to know private details about Styles’ reported new relationship with Tess Ward. In this one, the site pretended it had insight about the romance, such as the singer liking to cook for Ward and play her music. Again, obvious conclusions: Styles used to work as a baker and it’s pretty typical for musicians to play their music for significant others. It was also apparent the outlet didn’t have a real source as the quotes were awkwardly and unnaturally phrased. But HollywoodLies also ended up exposing its own fabrication by proclaiming to know all about the relationship in that story, only to run one hours later about Ward only being his “rumored” girlfriend. And then later in the week, the publication had an entirely random angle, with an article claiming Kris Jenner was disappointed Styles’ romance with Kendall Jenner didn’t work out. Much like with Styles’ inner circle, Jenner’s certainly isn’t going around talking about Styles and her daughter with HollywoodLies, of all places, particularly when the site has been caught fudging Jenner stories in the past. It was also quite obvious the blog only ran this story to seize on the attention currently surrounding Styles. After all, we’ve repeatedly demonstrated how HollywoodLies takes a hot topic (or hot person) and makes up related posts. This is done for two reasons: To game Google by offering original content and to get the attention of fans on social media by giving them “exclusives” to obsess over. This week, Styles was the bait. Not only with the multiple fabricated stories, but also with Friday’s installment: “Harry Styles: Why He Rules As HollywoodLife’s Star Of The Week.” This (not real) award was only given to the singer to get his attention and that of his fans. But why should Styles or his supporters give HollywoodLies the time of day after all the lies it’s told not just this past week, but year after year? It is quite reasonable to celebrate Styles having a milestone week in his career. It is not genuine, however, when you do so after purposefully spreading misinformation. Plain and simple, HollywoodLies is exploiting Styles and his fans for its own personal gain. It’s shameful.

U.S. Editions Australia Edition China Edition India Edition Italy Edition Japan Edition Singapore Edition United Kingdom United States May 14, 2:35 AM EDT Subscribe Search Search Business Technology World National Media & Culture Millennial Money Entertainment Sports Subscribe Technology YouTube Ad Revenue: Google Report Says Blocking Music From Website Would Hurt Music Industry By Eric Chiu @eric_chiu On 05/13/17 AT 3:18 PM Close For fans, there are now more places than ever to hear music online. But, if you don’t want to spring for a subscription to a streaming music service, there’s always — to the music industry’s chagrin — YouTube. While YouTube is home to official music video services like Vevo, it also frequently hosts ripped and pirated versions of songs, which has earned the music industry’s ire. However, a Google-commissioned report from analyst firm RBB Economics says removing music from YouTube would encourage users to move to pirated or lower-quality sources to get their music. Read: Spotify IPO Date: Company To Go Public Via Direct Listing Later This Year, Report Says Among the report’s findings: 85 percent of users would move to other channels like radio, streaming radio or piracy if music content were blocked or removed from YouTube. If users were no longer able to listen to music on YouTube, the report estimates that they would spend up to 29 percent more time listening to pirated content. Only 15 percent of YouTube music listeners would make the jump to a streaming music service like Spotify or Apple Music. Blocking YouTube versions of songs did not result in a significant bump in plays from streaming services. RBB pulled its data for this area from Germany, where YouTube was previously in a dispute with performing rights agency Gema that resulted in songs being blocked from YouTube. To produce its findings, RBB said it drew from a 1,500 user survey. The firm also analyzed data from YouTube and streaming services for around 5,000 songs in Germany, Italy, France and the United Kingdom across three years. According to Google, RBB will release additional findings in the next few weeks. For YouTube’s part, it has taken measures to help combat pirated links and songs. According to Google, it has paid out more than $1 billion in ad revenue and content identification tools have allowed music companies to earn revenue from songs uploaded by fans. YouTube also launched YouTube Red in 2014 and the premium subscription program includes features like ad-free viewing and background listening that are targeted at music listeners. Read: YouTube Announces New Original 'Red' Shows However, artists and the music industry have frequently slammed YouTube and its artist efforts. In a talk with Billboard last June, Nine Inch Nails frontman Trent Reznor said YouTube’s relationship with artists and the industry was built on unfair terms. “Personally, I find YouTube’s business to be very disingenuous,” Reznor told Billboard. “It is built on the backs of free, stolen content and that’s how they got that big. I think any free-tiered service is not fair. It’s making their numbers and getting them a big IPO and it is built on the back of my work and that of my peers. That’s how I feel about it. Strongly. We’re trying to build a platform that provides an alternative -- where you can get paid and an artist can control where their [content] goes.” Black Keys drummer Patrick Carney also echoed Reznor’s sentiments on Twitter: Give me five minutes on @youtube and I probably can find 250 songs that are available which the artist isn't getting paid for. At least. — Patrick Carney (@patrickcarney) June 16, 2016 Join the Discussion Most Read Newsletter Everything You Need To Know, Right Now Sign up for the newsletter.

Fox News Fox Business Fox News Go Fox News Radio Fox Nation Fox News Insider Fox Business Home Markets Politics Features Media & Advertising Cloud Innovation Business Leaders Technology FBN TV SHOWS ANCHORS & REPORTERS SCHEDULE VIDEO Search Echo Steps Up Game To Fend Off Rivals ADVERTISEMENT On Our Radar Refresh Close On Our Radar Load More Echo Steps Up Game To Fend Off Rivals Published May 09, 2017 Industries Dow Jones Newswires Facebook Twitter Print Amazon.com is due to unveil a new Echo speaker with a screen that will incorporate video calling capabilities, according to people familiar with the matter, keeping the online retailer one step ahead of tech rivals in seeking to control smart homes.  Continue Reading Below The new device, which is expected to be announced as early as Tuesday, will also allow users to make internet-based telephone calls, according to these people, setting the speaker up to be core to a home's communications.  Equipped with a 7-inch touch screen, the device will be able to visually summon answers to verbal questions, providing information like e-commerce search results in a more digestible fashion. The new Echo, which has been in beta testing with employees for a few months, could start shipping to consumers as early as next month.  An Amazon spokeswoman declined to comment.  The new device is expected to be priced at more than $200. The current Echo speaker, which doesn't have a screen, usually sells for $180, although it is currently on sale for $150. Late last month, Amazon introduced a separate Echo device equipped with a camera but no screen, the Look, which is priced at $200. The Echo Look is so far only available to consumers via invitation.  Amazon is in a broader race with a number of tech giants to create and install speakers using digital assistants to eventually run homes, cars and offices. Alphabet's Google Home is the biggest competitor so far to Amazon and its Alexa digital assistant. Microsoft on Monday introduced its new voice-controlled speaker, Invoke, made by Samsung Electronics, that can make phone calls. Consumers are able to use devices like the Echo and Google Home to turn off lights, close the garage door, lower the temperature and -- in Amazon's case -- order online. But none have expanded their speaker devices to include screens yet.  Continue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT The Wall Street Journal first reported last year that Amazon's Lab126 hardware unit was working on an Alexa-powered device featuring a tabletlike computer screen, allowing users to summon webpages, videos or images.  Separately, the Seattle-based retailer is expected to announce a broader rollout of telephone services for Echo devices within the next few weeks, according to the people, a feature The Wall Street Journal reported on in February.  Calling capabilities may be rolled out in stages, one of the people said, for example starting as an intercom within the house between Echo devices, or between Echo owners. Because the capabilities are internet based, it isn't expected to require a SIM card or other mobile phone technology.  Bloomberg earlier reported that Amazon was working on a new device that was likely to have a 7-inch touch screen, while CNET reported an announcement of a new Echo was likely to take place this month.  Amazon's Echo is off to an early lead, analysts say, thanks in part to its release in 2014. (Google Home was introduced late last year.) The Echo dominates the market for voice-enabled speakers with a 70.6% share, digital marketing research firm eMarketer said Monday. Google Home has the second-highest market share at 23.8%.  "Consumers are becoming increasingly comfortable with the technology, which is driving engagement," said Martín Utreras, vice president of forecasting for the firm.  Amazon has also added thousands of applications, from being able to hail an Uber to order a Domino's Pizza. Until now, developers have generally limited its artificial intelligence-powered assistant Alexa's response to a couple options to keep from overwhelming users.  Amazon's move to introduce its screened Echo device may also be an effort to head off new competition with Microsoft's Invoke launch. The personal video call field has long been dominated by Microsoft's Skype and Apple's FaceTime, among other services. Earlier this year, Amazon announced its new Chime videoconferencing service, marking its entry into the market.  The new Echo screen device will likely support some of the same functionality as the Echo Look, which will enable consumers to take videos and photos of their outfits and compare them via algorithms, according to one of the people. It is unclear why Amazon is launching the two devices so close together or how the market segments they target may differ.  Ryan Knutson contributed to this article.  Write to Laura Stevens at laura.stevens@wsj.com Fox Business Markets Politics Features FBN TV About Fox Business Channel Finder Advertise With Us Jobs Internships New Terms of Use (What's new) New Privacy Policy FAQ Media Relations Closed Captioning Policy Accessibility Statement Quotes delayed at least 15 minutes.

There is a Swagbucks Swag Code available today from 1 pm to 3 pm for 2 SB points! The code is: CrunchTime Enter the code in the Swag Code box at Swagbucks.com HERE. New to Swagbucks? If you don't know about Swagbucks yet, it's the largest rewards website that gives people free gift cards for the things they do online (searching, shopping, watching videos, playing games and more). You earn points called SB for online activities and then you can cash them in for gift cards to places like Amazon, Target, Walmart, CVS, Lowes, Starbucks, Paypal, Bass Pro Shops, Kohl's and so many more! It's free to join and I have earned a bunch of gift cards in the many years I have been a member. Look below for a bonus sign up code! How do you get these SB points? There are lots of ways. * Search online: Each time you need to search for something online, use the Swagbucks search engine on their website (instead of Google). I actually have the Swagbucks toolbar installed on my desktop and it places a search box right on my screen making it super easy to search. Every once in a while, they award SB points just for doing the searches I used to do using Google. * Take surveys on their website * Answer the daily poll * Watch videos through their website or multiple mobile apps (I earn about 80 - 100 SB a day doing this) * Use their online shopping portal (I do most of my online shopping at major retailers who are part of the Swagbucks Shop and Earn program (like Amazon.com, Kohls.com, Walmart.com and more) and earn Swagbucks every time I shop. Just this week, I was credited with 562 SB points (worth $5.62 in gift cards) for an online purchase I made a few weeks ago. * Play games * Participate in special Swag Code events * Enter the daily Swag Code (which we usually let you know about here on the blog each day). Swagbucks posts bonus codes on their Facebook, Twitter and blog pages each day. If you have the Swagbucks Mobile App, it will buzz when there is a new code. When the code becomes available each day, one of us posts it here on the blog so we can all get it. The codes are only valid for an hour usually. Once you get the code, you then copy and paste the code into the Swag Code box at the top of the homepage of Swagbucks.com. Look for the circle with the words Swag Code next to it. New member bonus Swagbucks sign-up code! As I posted above, new members get a 70 SB bonus when you sign up HERE. To get the bonus SB points, click the text that reads "I have a sign up code" during registration and then enter the code: SMARTSHOPPER to get the bonus.

None of them really panned out, but I begrudgingly have to admit that the project they just unveiled - Project Treble - has some more meat to it than the vague promises and alliances they usually peddle. The basic gist here is that Google is splitting Android in twain, so they end up with the Android OS Framework and the vendor implementation. The latter - the part that's the reason why so many Android phones don't get updated - can remain the same across operating system updates. Today, with no formal vendor interface, a lot of code across Android needs to be updated when a device moves to a newer version of Android. With a stable vendor interface providing access to the hardware-specific parts of Android, device makers can choose to deliver a new Android release to consumers by just updating the Android OS framework without any additional work required from the silicon manufacturers. This seems like a good idea, but sadly, it won't be backported to older Android versions. Treble will be part of Android O later this year (it's already available in Pixel developer previews), but existing phones won't benefit from it at all. In other words, it'll be a few years before the full effect of this project can be measured. As a sidenote - and you guys will have to help me out on this one, since I'm not knowledgeable enough to determine this - could this mean it'll be easier to replace the Linux-based vendor implementation with something else in the future? If so, that might be something Google is potentially perhaps maybe possibly interested in.

The 7-inch (17.5 centimeter) screen on the new Echo Show enables the speaker to supplement voice responses with visuals and other information displays , similar to the Echo-like features on the Fire tablets and Fire TV streaming devices. That could mean extended weather forecasts, not just current conditions, or music lyrics to go with the song you’re listening to. You can also call up cooking tutorials on YouTube, hands-free, while making dinner in the kitchen. You’ll also be able to make video calls with other Echo Show devices or the Alexa app for iPhones and Android phones. Two previous models, the original Echo and the smaller Echo Dot, will get audio calling only, as they lack screens and cameras. Video and audio calls will be free. The new Echo Show goes on sale on June 28 for US$230, making it the priciest Echo yet. The market for voice-assisted speakers is small but growing. Research firm eMarketer expects use to more than double to almost 36 million Americans using such a device at least once a month by year-end. Amazon’s Echo is expected to continue dominating, with a market share of nearly 71 percent, although eMarketer expects Google’s Home speaker to cut into that. Google Home recently got the ability to recognize individuals within a family by voice, allowing for more precise recommendations and ad targeting. Amazon doesn’t yet have voice-recognition. But Google Home doesn’t have a screen or video calling. All Echo devices can respond to voice requests for weather, news, music and other tasks. The original device, simply called Echo, sells for US$150. Amazon and Google will get a new rival this fall: On Monday, Microsoft and Samsung’s Harman business teased an upcoming speaker, called Invoke, powered by Microsoft’s Cortana digital assistant.

The conference in Barcelona covered a wide range of topics, but for enterprises the most important issues were IoT and how enterprise resources can be made available on smartphones without sacrificing security. Here are some of the trends and announcements from this year that will have an impact on enterprise mobility: IoT can be more tightly integrated with business processes To make data from connected sensors more useful, IoT platform vendors are joining forces with software companies to open the door for better integration. Jasper teamed with Salesforce as well as SAP. The goal in both cases is to make it easier to deploy and manage IoT services. For example, the Jasper Control Center platform, which automates management, will be integrated with SAP's Hana platform. Android is becoming more enterprise-friendly Google's announcement of Android for Work the week before Mobile World Congress was hardly a coincidence. The timing let the company's partners, including AirWatch, demonstrate their compatible management tools and products in Barcelona. Android for Work -- which separates business apps from personal apps -- is a big step in Google's effort to dispel notions that its OS isn't safe enough for enterprise users. Time to start thinking about wearables In a sign of things to come, enterprise mobility management vendor Good Technology announced that it now supports Android Wear. For example, a smartwatch running the OS can be used to unlock access to smartphone applications, according to Good. As wearables become more popular, IT managers will have to start looking at what opportunities and challenges they present. More super-secure devices are on the way Swiss company Silent Circle announced a new smartphone and tablet along with enterprise messaging software. The BlackPhone 2 smartphone will go on sale in June with a similar price to its predecessor, the BlackPhone, which costs US$629. The specification includes a 5.5-inch screen and an octa-core processor. The Blackphone+ tablet will arrive during the second half of the year. Beyond a 7-inch screen, not much has yet been reveled about its specification. The Swiss company also said it's working on an encrypted, peer-to-peer email system. The more established vendors are also taking steps to lock down their smartpones. Samsung has extended the company's partnership with BlackBerry to include technology from its subsidiary Secusmart. The resulting SecuSuite for Samsung Knox -- for encrypting voice, text and data traffic -- will be available later this year. Affordable smartphones aren't just for consumers Mid-range smartphones have become much more capable in just the last year, with octa-core processors, 5-inch screens and LTE becoming standard features. So, any responsible CIO needs to seriously consider Android-based smartphones that cost around $300 unlocked, instead of devices that are twice as expensive or more. Microsoft also wants a piece of the action, as it hopes to increase Windows Phone and later Windows 10 market share. It launched the Lumia 640 and the Lumia 640XL phones at the conference. The company is also working with AT&T in the U.S. on the Mobile Office Suite to bundle smartphones, Office 365 and wireless plans for small and medium-size enterprises.

Users under 18 will be able to request the removal of all records relating to them. The measure is one of a series that May's Conservative Party will promise in its election manifesto, due to be published next week. It aims to protect children online and make it easier for businesses to set up and operate on the web. May proposes tighter rules for how the companies deal with hate speech, pornography and illegal content and she wants to empower regulators to fine companies. There will be restrictions on how companies store data and users will be able to access information about them. The move from the U.K. government to require social networks to delete personal data goes far beyond existing requirements. Social networks such as Facebook and Twitter are a trove of information, with platforms storing years of personal details, from posts to photos. Google has been pushing back against European rulings around the right to be forgotten. "The Internet has brought a wealth of opportunity but also significant new risks which have evolved faster than society's response to them," May said in an emailed statement. "We want social media companies to do more to help redress the balance and will take action to make sure they do." Spokespeople from Twitter, Google Inc., or Snapchat Inc. did not respond to request for comment. Facebook declined to comment. This month, Home Secretary Amber Rudd warned Facebook, Alphabet Inc.'s Google, and Twitter to improve monitoring of extremist and hate content. She was responding to Parliament's cross-party Home Affairs Committee, which said the companies are "shamefully" far from having done enough to deal with illegal and dangerous content. Within the EU, attempts by individuals to ask search engines to stop linking to unwanted content is currently processed on a case by case basis. If Google refuses, then citizens can appeal. The EU General Data Protection Regulation, which comes into force in May next year, will give individuals more control over their personal data. But as well as urging companies to improve their behavior, the Conservatives are offering to encourage people to do more business online. Companies will be able to insist on a digital signature, with the government supporting the development of digital forms of identification. Customers will get the right to cancel contracts online and to clear, simple terms and conditions for online services.

(AMZN) Echo Speaker’s Alexa Skills Apple Inc.’s (AAPL) First Advanced Manufacturing Fund Investment Goes to Corning The Tesla Inc (TSLA) Solar Roof Is Available … And Cheaper! View All Posts This is a very high profile time for Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and its Alexa smart assistant/Echo smart speaker combination. The latest new Amazon Echo — the Echo Show — has just been announced. Plus, Alexa voice calling just launched. Source: Amazon This comes just weeks after the Echo Look was unveiled. Alphabet Inc’s (NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG) Google and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) are now in the smart speaker game, and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is expected to take the wraps off a Siri speaker as soon as June. With this flurry of activity, it’s worth looking at the Amazon Echo’s biggest advantage: the thousands of Alexa skills. These capabilities let AMZN and third-party developers add functionality to the Amazon Echo and other Alexa-enabled smart speakers. There are currently more than 10,000 Alexa skills, and here are 10 of the coolest. The Smart Home AMZN currently lists nearly 400 Alexa smart home skills. One of the most popular lets your Amazon Echo control Google’s Nest smart thermostat with voice commands. You can also use Alexa to control the popular Hue smart lighting system. You can tell your Amazon Echo to turn lights on or off in specific rooms, change the color and even adjust brightness, all without picking up a smartphone, touching a switch or launching an app. Social Media Thanks to Alexa, AMZN can make interacting with your social media feeds a hands-free task. You can’t view Instagram photos (although that will undoubtedly come when the Echo Show hits shelves), but Twitter Inc (NYSE:TWTR) and the rest are represented through third-party Alexa skills. You can use Twitter Reader to have your Amazon Echo read out loud key information including Twitter Likes, Retweets, Mentions and Trending Tweets. Want to get the latest words of wisdom from President Trump? Ask your Echo to check POTUS Tweets. Utilities Find Phone is one of those skills that everyone can use. It solves the issue of misplacing your smartphone in the couch cushions by having your Amazon Echo call the phone to activate its ringer. Having trouble sleeping? Skills like Ambient Noise: Rainforest Sounds will play soothing tracks in the background to drown out all the noise and help you nod off.

Previously available to Pixel phones, Google Assistant lets users talk to his phone in a conversational way, providing answers to questions about weather, flight information and appointments. Yes, it’s like Apple’s Siri. LG was one of the first smartphone makers to reveal it would feature the assistant on its new device, the G6. In its blog post, the assistant will be rolled out this week in the US, while users in Canada, Australia, Germany and the UK will get the feature soon as well. “With this update, hundreds of millions of Android users will now be able to try out the Google Assistant,” Gummi Hafsteinsson, product lead for Google Assistant, said. To use this (if you have Nougat or Marshmallow operating system), just long press the Home button and say “Ok Google” to get started. And now, you can ask things such as ‘What’s my confirmation number for my London flight,’ ‘Take me to Museu Picasso,’ ‘Do I need an umbrella today,’ and many more. According to its blog, there is no need to download the update because Google Assistant will be usable on phones running Nougat and Marshmallow with Google Play Services. “Our goal is to make the Assistant available anywhere you need it. It came to Android Wear 2.0 – via new smartwatches – just a few weeks ago and, as we previewed in January, the Assistant is also coming to TVs and cars,” Hafsteinsson said.   Facebook Comments Website Comments free pron March 6th, 2017 Reply ab5Pn3 My brother suggested I might like this website.

Eliminating fears That is thus as the first-step generally deals with acknowledgement. It will take humility to tell the truth about these things, and getting rid of them becomes extra. You think about now on what you’re to get rid of the said concerns in your life as being a leader, and you also do this by being alert to the cases where these doubts overrule your thoughts and judgment as being a leader. Show patience with yourself if you learn yourself not able to beat your anxieties immediately. Hence, it sometimes becomes an effort and problem and perseverance is a great characteristic that you’re mastering while you cope with the anxieties. In working with your concerns, you’re increasing strength and intelligence like a boss. For you to carry on carrying out a superior occupation, you must also make time to reward oneself to be a better boss.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: YouTube and Facebook Are Going After Television Both are producing new high-quality original series. Adam Levy (TMFnCaffeine) May 13, 2017 at 10:00AM Digital advertising has already surpassed television advertising in the United States. Now, the biggest digital ad businesses -- Google and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) -- are working to really cut into TV's $70 billion revenue stream. Both companies are planning to commission television-quality videos. Facebook's will show up in its recently launched video tab in its flagship Facebook app. The Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) company will distribute its new originals via YouTube. YouTube is hoping to win back advertisers' good graces after controversy arose around ads being shown next to objectionable content on its website. Facebook, meanwhile, is trying to get users to spend even more time in its app and find more places to stick advertisements. Best.Cover.Ever is one of the new YouTube originals. Image source: YouTube. The third time's a charm for YouTube This isn't the first time YouTube has tried its hand at producing original content. It spent $100 million seeding celebrity channels in 2011. After that initiative failed to take off, YouTube shuttered the channels and opened studio spaces for its top content creators to produce new originals. Now, its newest effort goes back to big-name celebrities like Kevin Hart and Ellen Degeneres. But YouTube's business strategy seems to be somewhat misguided. "Five years ago, 85 percent of all original series were ad-supported," Robert Kyncl, YouTube's business chief, said. "This year, that number has fallen to just over two-thirds." That number is only moving lower as ad-free streaming services and premium cable networks produce more original shows. Still, the growth in premium ad-free content doesn't mean there's been a decline in advertising opportunities on television. There are more new original shows being produced than ever before, and there are so many great shows on television, an entire industry has cropped up in the last decade to help people figure out what they should watch. That's not to say YouTube won't be able to attract advertisers to its new content. It's reportedly already signed on some major brands. But it will have to attract advertisers away from a market that still has plenty of life left in it, not the shrinking industry Kyncl alludes to. Facebook wants to become your new video habit On Facebook's fourth-quarter earnings call, CEO Mark Zuckerberg described two use cases for Facebook. The first is whenever users have a free minute, they'll skim through their news feed. The second use case is when they're seeking out specific entertainment and want to see content from someone they follow, or a topic they're interested in. That's a use case Facebook is still working on, and one currently being won by television and YouTube. "We want people to think of Facebook as a place for interesting and relevant video content from professional creators as well as their friends," Zuckerberg said on Facebook's fourth-quarter earnings call. "Last year we started to invest in more original video content to help seed the ecosystem, and we're planning to do more in 2017." Indeed, Facebook is reportedly working with creators to produce two dozen original programs. A handful will be longer, big-budget shows of TV-level quality. Some described the quality of Facebook's longer shows as on the level of House of Cards, the hit Netflix original. The rest will be shorter, 5- to 10-minute shows updated daily. Facebook is paying for the content upfront, but the goal is to eventually develop a fully ad-supported ecosystem of quality content using mid-roll video ads. The move would open up further ad inventory for Facebook, which is bumping up against ad load saturation. Television-quality programming combined with Facebook's superior ad targeting, compared to television networks, could help Facebook steal away some ad budgets from television. It may also help Facebook win over some YouTube ad budgets, as the latter fights to keep advertisers in place with its new originals. But Facebook will have to instill a new user behavior, which is a tough task. If any company has the strength to change how people use its product, though, it's Facebook.

But I'm not here to praise Sublime. In this post I'm rather going to share some of the Sublime plugins I've been using a lot and which are really helpful and fun to work with. You may find them for your favorite text editor as well. Let's dive into the first one. 1) Text Pastry How many times have you had a markup and all you wanted to do was to add incremental numbers to it? For example if you have a list with a heavy content, of course you can't use Emmet or similar tools to add those incremental numbers because the markup is already there, unless you use some tricks. However there is a faster way to get there. With Text Pastry plugin we can extend the power of multiple selections in Sublime and do lots of awesome things. Here is the basic usage of this plugin: Sometimes you even have a range of numbers in mind and, as you can see in the video, you will be able to put numbers in a specific range and you can even specify the steps. Pretty cool, huh? This plugin can do more than what I have just shown you. You can find more information and examples on GitHub. If you are using Atom you can find the Text Pastry plugin here. 2) Super Calculator Once I needed a component, but since I didn't have much time, writing it from scratch was not ideal. Fortunately I could find that component on the web; however the developer used pxs for all the properties and sizes. So for making that component responsive I was supposed to change all the pxs to em or rem, and, as you know, doing that is just a pain in the ass. I used Cmd/Ctrl+D to see all the pxs units and then I stared at the screen wishing I had a magic wand to turn all those pxs units into a relative unit. It turned out that magic existed and I did find it after 5 minutes of Googling. Super Calculator is just amazing, all you have to do is press Alt+C and Super Calculator will select the mathematical expression closest to the cursor position so that you can review what is going to be calculated. If you press Alt+C for a second time, it will calculate the result and insert it into your code right away, or if you select a mathematical expression and hit Alt+C, the magic will happen all the same. 3) InstaGoogling I think I found this one on Twitter and it's just brilliant. When we code we usually love to make our text editor fullscreen so that we can concentrate at our best. But sometimes we get to this point where we need to find something on the web, maybe a piece of code or maybe a wired syntax, hence we have to get out of that fullscreen mode. InstaGoogling plugin will help you to Google something without losing the full-screen mode. All you have to do is hit f1 and you will have a nice Google window popping up on your screen. After installing this plugin you will need to add its extension to Chrome as well. As you can see from the video, I'm going through my search result by using the tab key, I hit enter for opening the page and I use Ctrl+W to close the window, so that I don't have to move my hands away from the keyboard. Another great feature of InstaGoogling is that you can select a piece of code, then hit f1 and the plugin will search that on Google automatically and it will insert the language at the end of that piece in order to have a better result. Unfortunately there isn't yet a version of plugin for Mac, but I hope it will come out soon, as it seems to be in the making. 4) Open-Include To me this plugin is the most handy one. Usually in a project you have a lot of files and you wanna be able to easily move back and forth from one file to another. Imagine you are looking at your Sass index file and you see a lot of imports and paths. if you want to open one of them you can move the cursor on that path and just simply hit Alt+D and boom, you will be in that file. What I love about Open-Include is that it doesn't matter what that path is and where it goes, Open-Include will just open it for you. You can be dealing with a JavaScript module or a file on a CDN or an image, this plugin will do its job in any case. Unfortunately this plugin was removed from packagecontrol.io. As a consequence, you can't install it as you normally would, but you can go to its Github page, download the entire set of files and install the plugin manually by pasting all files in your package folder. 5) Console Wrap I have a colleague who, from time to time, comes to me bad mouthing another colleague of ours: "Why does he never remove his console.log lines?" Console Wrap can help us removing those lines my colleague hates so much: If you use Atom try this plugin. How can we find awesome plugins on our own? To be honest when I discussed with Chris the possibility of writing this post I only had four plugins in my mind, so I said to myself: 'I'm not gonna write this post with a title like "4 Plugins…" that is so lame!' So I went to packagecontrol.io, to the trending section in the hope of finding something useful, and I immediately spotted Console Wrap plugin shining there and it turned out I really needed this plugin. So, from time to time do go to this page. You may find something you didn't know you needed which will make your life so much easier!

Gets rid of all those small repetitions you probably don’t even think about. For instance <?php echo '’ . print_r($variable) . ”; ?> can now be done with CTRL+SHIFT+O, placing whatever you selected into the print_r(). Reply ↓ Michael Tunnell Permalink to comment# May 12, 2017 I use Text Pastry all the time and it’s a great plugin. I had not heard of Super Calculator and that looks awesome! I am totally installing that. :) Quick Question: do you know why Open-Include was removed from Package Control? Reply ↓ Mojtaba Seyedi Permalink to comment# May 12, 2017 I have no idea, but I’m curious too. zomars Permalink to comment# May 13, 2017 You can do the calculator thing natively in Sublime, just select the math expression and press: Cmd + Shift + Y Reply ↓ Mojtaba Seyedi Permalink to comment# May 13, 2017 Thank you so much. Although it’s not natively, it’s an Emmet action but that’s not a problem since everyone uses Emmet. But the reason I choose Super Calculator is that after you run the action it keeps the result selected so for example in the demo I can easily go back to the beginning of the values and put a space before them. But Emmet doesn’t do this for me and I don’t know whether you can change this behavior in Emmet. But for normal situation Emmet is great as well.
