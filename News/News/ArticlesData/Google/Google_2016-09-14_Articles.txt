This cow's face was blurred out on a canal path in Cambridge. Google street view A cow roaming on a canal tow path has proved an internet hit - after someone spotted Google had given the same blur treatment normally given to human's to protect their privacy. The animal was captured by Google's street view cameras at Coe Fen in Cambridge in August last year. But the cow's pixelated face quickly became a social media phenomenon when Guardian journalist David Shariatmadari tweeted a screen grab of it on Tuesday. Moments before the cow's face was in full view. Google street view It has since been retweeted more than 9,000 times and liked by more than 12,000 people. One twitter user said the blur applied to the cow's face was "Udderly ridiculous", while another said the cow was now "anonymoos". However just a few metres further along the tow path, the cow's face can been seen without a blur effect added. A Google spokesperson told ITV News: "We thought you were pulling the udder one when we herd the moos, but it's clear that our automatic face-blurring technology has been a little overzealous. "Of course, we don't begrudge this cow milking its five minutes of fame." Share this article Share via email Share via Facebook Share via Twitter Share via Whatsapp Home UK WHERE TO NOW?

The picture, which was taken last summer at Coe Fen, was spotted by the Guardian’s US opinion editor David Shariatmadari. David Shariatmadari (@D_Shariatmadari) Great to see Google takes cow privacy seriously pic.twitter.com/ACTBpDwno6 September 13, 2016 Although the cow can be seen in all its bovine glory in one image near the river Cam, Google appears to have blurred it for a tighter crop. The search giant admitted its technology may have been a little overeager. A spokesperson for Google told the BBC: “We thought you were pulling the udder one when we herd the moos, but it’s clear that our automatic face-blurring technology has been a little overzealous. Of course, we don’t begrudge this cow milking its five minutes of fame.” Shariatmadari’s tweet has been retweeted more than 9,000 times – with plenty of cow jokes among the replies. Tim Bale (@ProfTimBale) @D_Shariatmadari @jonworth Some people think one cow looks much like any udder. Not so!

Howard Furst (@revhowardfurst) @D_Shariatmadari @jazmasta Cows should dress more modestly so they don't have to have their faces blurred in shame. pic.twitter.com/dBkfvpVprR September 13, 2016 The cow picture has echoes of an image released in May by West Midlands police of three lambs being transported in a Ford Galaxy people carrier. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Stolen lambs Photograph: West Midlands Police/PA Officers spotted the unusual cargo in Yardley, Birmingham, and pursued the vehicle, which hit a parked car. Three men abandoned the Ford and its cuddly cargo, but were arrested after a search of nearby gardens. One was found up a tree and another in a conservatory. The three lambs were rehomed at a farm in Sheldon while officers attempted to trace their owners.

Google Duo was one of two messaging apps announced during Google’s developer conference a few months ago. Duo is a video messaging app, while its counterpart Allo is a text messaging app powered by the Google Assistant. The app had reached five million downloads in the first week that it had been released, a number which has doubled in the three weeks following. However, you’d never know of it’s success while its currently ranked number 127 in the App Store. Just two days after its launch, Duo had risen to first place the Google Play Store. Since then, the app has fallen from grace by more than 100 spaces. However, according to Android Police, those who use it really enjoy it, therefore awarding it with 4.4 stars. Reviewers have praised the app’s simplicity, despite getting overshadowed by other announcements during Google’s developer conference. Both Duo and Allo are end to end encrypted. Download Duo on iOS and Android here. Related: Google’s voice chat app Duo has been downloaded over 5 million times on Android SourceAndroid Police Vito R. Allo is *optionally* end to end encrypted but only if in incognito mode. In which case you don’t get the Google Assistant benefits. FlamesFan89 I’ve been using Duo with my parents. They love to have video chats with our kids. The quality of Duo is much higher compared to Hangouts. I’m happy with the switch. Ipse Yeah, but can you make calls to regular phones? I’m a Hangouts user confused by the new apps…. FlamesFan89 No, it is purely for video chats. I too am confused by the need for multiple apps, but I’m starting to think that they are taking the “Steam Whistle” approach, as in, Steam Whistle beer, who’s tag line is “Do one thing really, really well”. Ipse I get it…after a few beers, the differences start to fade away 🙂 I’ll stick with Hangouts for now…really don’t want another app. If Duo worked with FaceTime (and we know why it doesn’t) it might have convinced more users to switch.

These finding were revealed by a designer who scraped the popular websites and recorded all the colours used in the homepages and style sheets.  Facebook, Wikipedia and Amazon all have something in common - not only these sits some of the most visited on the web, but they are all blue. The internet's 10 most popular websites have nearly twice as many shades of blue than red and yellow, and three times as much as green  THE TOP 10 WEBSITES 1. Google 2. YouTube 3.  Facebook 4.  Baidu 5. Yahoo  6. Wikipedia 7. Amazon 8. Google.co 9. Qq  10. Twitter  Although a small sample size, as there are some 4.7 million pages on the World Wide Web, it is enough for some to name blue the internet's 'most popular colour'. Paul Herbert, the mastermind behind this research, used Alexa to narrow down the 10 most popular sites on the web, which includes Google (#1), Amazon (#7) and YouTube (#3). After gathering a complete list of colours found on all of these webpages, Herbert transformed the data into a series of visuals, reports Wired. 'I often struggle to create colour schemes, and was curious about what other companies are doing,' he told Wired. Other research for the colour blue shows that it makes people feel tranquil, wet and cool. RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next From a solar eclipse to a star gazing warrior: Winners of...

Share this article Share 39 shares While red is found to stimulate senses, which is why many restaurants include the colour in their logo, blue does just the opposite – it relaxes the mind. It seems the most popular websites on the internet have used this colour on their homepages and style sheets in an attempt to make people feel calm so they spend more time on the site. Paul Herbert, the mastermind behind this research, used Alexa to narrow down the 10 most popular sites on the web, which includes Google (#1), Amazon (#7) and YouTube (#3) Although, Facebook may be the exception since its CEO Mark Zuckerberg is red-green colour blind and blue is the colour he can see the best. Herbert has plans to rescrape the data regularly, but intends to keep the analysis to a minimum, as it can become outdated when the data changes. 'Once I have data over a larger time period I'll be able to examine and graph trends in web development,' he said. WHAT FEELINGS DO RED, GREEN AND BLUE PROVOKE? Red: Passionate, Aggressive, Important As a dominating color, red adds gravity and heightened awareness – quite literally, as the color increases blood circulation, breathing rates, and metabolism. Red can take on a variety of meaning, associated with both love and war, but the unifying factor in all meanings is a sense of importance. Think of the red carpet. Red is a color best used cautiously. Its knack for attracting attention makes it a priceless tool for designers, but excessively it will inhibit relaxation. Lighter shades emphasize the energetic aspects of red – including youthfulness – while darker shades emphasize power, and even durability, such as a brick wall. Green: Natural, Stable, Prosperous Green mostly represents the environment and outdoors, making it the clear choice to suggest nature and an organic quality. As the bridge between stimulating warm colors and calming cool colors, it is the most balanced of colors, lending it an air of stability. It's also a popular choice as an accent or for calls-to-action because it stands out, but more softly than the warmer colors. In Western Culture, it also represents money and financial safety. Blue: Serene, Trustworthy, Inviting Blue is one of the most popular colors in web design – and for good reason. Blue is the color of calm and serenity, and as such inspires security and a feeling of safety. For this reason, blue is a color often used by banks. However the calming effects also make blue a friendly and inviting color, which explains its adoption by Facebook and Twitter.  'I also plan to examine the difference in color usage between popular websites from different parts of the world.' The internet isn't the only place shrouded in blue, many stores have used the colour in their advertisements. A recent study from the University of Oregon and University of Cincinnati looked at how colors influence or biases the way consumers make ethical judgments, specifically if they view a company as environmentally friendly. Herbert recorded all the colours used in the homepages and style sheets. After gathering a complete list of colours found on all 10 sites, Herbert then transformed the data into a series of visuals Results indicated consumers considered companies with blue logos to be more eco-friendly, compared to those with red logos. 'What we're finding is that color biases the way consumers make ethical judgments,' Aparna said Sundar, a professor of marketing in the University of Oregon Lundquist College of Business.  'Of course green is one of those colors, but blue is also one of those colors that consumers associate with eco-friendliness.'  The team gave shoppers a fictitious logo with a color of a known brand in different colours to gauge their reactions. Herbert has plans to rescrape the data regularly, but intends to will keep analysis to a minimum, as it could become outdated when the data changes Once researchers established a set of eco-friendly colors, they also identified colors perceived to be environmentally unfriendly, such as Target's red.  The results indicated that seeing a more eco-friendly color in a logo influences consumer judgments, and ethically ambiguous business practices seemed more ethical.  'Interestingly, blue is 'greener' than green in terms of conveying an impression of eco-friendliness, despite the frequent use of the word green to convey that idea,' said co-author James Kellaris of the University of Cincinnati's marketing department    Read more: The Most Popular Color On The Internet Is… | WIRED The Colors of the Web Share or comment on this article e-mail 39 shares Most watched News videos Man discovers wife is cheating on him following her with drone Mob storm police station and lynch suspected paedophile Victoria Fritz hides her baby bump moments before giving birth Ivanka Trump gives glimpse of her father's $100m penthouse Is this the creepy moment the corpse of a girl OPENS her eyes? 100 special police agents protect suspected paedophile from mob Shocking moment Kumbuka tries to smash glass at London Zoo President-elect Trump and family dine out at famous 21 Club Protestor at an anti-Trump rally at Ohio State gets slammed Cops shoot man holding 2-year-old girl hostage Chili's manager snatches veteran's free meal after complaint Little girl leaps to her sister's defense during scolding EXCLUSIVE: Blow up!

Now that Google Arts and Culture has added the famous halls and rooms of the British Prime Minister’s home and working quarters to its ever-growing collection of virtual reality tours and experiences, you can play political heavyweight for a day — or at the very least, see what it’s like to live and work in those quarters. As of Thursday, Google Arts and Culture invites anyone and everyone to “walk through historic rooms and hallways and get up-close looks at more than 50 photographs and works of art” inside historic 10 Downing Street in London. “Take a peek into the cabinet room, where the Prime Minister has held weekly cabinet meetings since 1735, or look around Margaret Thatcher’s office,” Google wrote in a blog post announcement. “Stroll down the grand main staircase, stopping to study the carefully ordered portraits of the house’s previous residents. Once you’re ready for some fresh air, you can wander through the gardens, where Winston Churchill liked to nap.” Related: You’ll be blown away by the world’s first virtual reality ballet experience It’s the latest in a series of exhibits Google has introduced to its unique digital museum of sorts. Already, you can stomp about with dinosaurs or go en pointe with ballerinas from some of the most prestigious companies in the world, and now you can get immersed in British politics. In addition to the tour of the prime minister’s office, Google has two other new online exhibits. The first serves as an introduction to  “two of Britain’s most iconic leaders, Winston Churchill and Harold Wilson.” The other draws attention to three of 10 Downing’s most historic places: the cabinet room, the study, and the grand staircase. While you can use your Android device, iPhone, or desktop to experience the virtual tour, the full immersive experience can be best achieved with Google Cardboard, which comes complete with the built-in audio tour. But hey, even without a VR headset, this is a pretty nifty way to visit one of the most historic sites in the U.K. Also watch: Google Brings Dinosaurs to Life in Arts & Culture App Please enable Javascript to watch this video

No one has harpooned the beast yet, but stunningly Amazon.com Inc. may be coming the closest. Everyone wants to be the digital brain at the centre of our automated homes. Just as Microsoft Corp.’s Windows became the software nervous system of nearly all personal computers, the thinking goes, some company will eventually become the Windows of the home. It will rule everything, from automatically recording a TV show to remotely unlocking the front door for a handyman. The company that figures out the home operating system may, like Microsoft did, bask in riches and shape the direction of the digital world. We’re far from achieving this Jetsons-like vision, but tech companies aren’t giving up. Apple’s new iOS 10 software for iPhones puts the company’s HomeKit home operating system front and centre, and chief executive officer Tim Cook proclaimed it “a huge moment for home automation”. Expect Google (Alphabet Inc.) to soon push hard with Google Home, one of the company’s multiple, chaotic attempts to become the digital controller for our homes. Somehow, surprisingly, Amazon has outmanoeuvred Apple, Google and all the other tech industry big guns with its two-year-old Echo line of digital-activated speakers that had cost $180. As pitched by Alec Baldwin in Super Bowl ads, the Echo will tell you the weather while you get dressed in the morning and play a Janet Jackson song at a voice command. The broader ambition, of course, is to connect users to Amazon shopping and to become a home operating system through connections to lights, door locks, refrigerators and any other imaginable thing that can be implanted with a computer chip. On Wednesday, Amazon announced that it would sell its Echo Dot model for $50—a price low enough to push many more curious people to buy one and plant Amazon’s home software brain in a room or two (or six) in the house. It also made an Echo model available outside the US for the first time. If the smart home ever becomes a reality—and tech history is littered with predictions of digital revolutions that never happened—it’s premature to pick winners and losers. Amazon’s biggest disadvantage is that the smartphone is still the centre of the world’s digital life, and that makes smartphone-based home automation approaches like Apple’s and Google’s the better bet. The Echo has been a hit so far only among a niche of technophiles, and Amazon’s reported goal of selling as many as 10 million of them next year is dinky compared with the 1 billion Apple devices in use worldwide. But when Amazon devotes itself to a mission, it can bulldoze everything it sees. The key to becoming a dominant operating system is persuading as many other companies as possible to tailor their products to your operating system, just as Microsoft did with Windows and Apple with iPhones. That’s what Amazon is doing by slowly convincing makers of air conditioners and thermostats and home security cameras to tailor their products to work with Amazon’s home software brain. The company is also planting its Echo-powering Alexa software into other companies’ home products and onto smartphone apps for iPhone and Android. That will help build the rationale for adapting home products for Amazon. Amazon is also devoting its considerable resources to push more people to buy Echo devices, including by offering a discount on diapers and a cut-price music service exclusively for Echo owners. Quietly, including in recent days, Amazon has been folding Alexa into its Fire TV streaming gadgets, into its Amazon Video apps for movies and TV shows and into its Fire tablets. These are all stealth ways for Amazon to make its home automation-capable software more intelligent and to spread it into more places. Amazon has never been content to be the world’s biggest bookstore. It became a store for everything. It transformed shopping into a membership club. The company invented a new model of computing with Amazon Web Services and planted its flag to become a global television network. And so we should never count Amazon out as the company that might land that white whale of taking over our digital homes.

 Apple is loading up talent for its push into Google Glass territory Kif Leswing Sep. 15, 2016, 6:53 PM 11,958 facebook linkedin twitter email print An artist's conception of Tim Cook wearing Google Glass. (Not a real photo.) AP / Matthew Sumner for Getty Images Apple continues to stockpile talent in augmented reality, an area that CEO Tim Cook has said is "incredibly interesting", as it looks like the company is working on some kind of display or technology that shows computer images superimposed on top of the real world. This month, Apple hired Zeyu Li, who had worked at Magic Leap, the secretive augmented reality startup, for over a year. He's "interested in deep learning, VR, AR, driverless car," according to his LinkedIn profile.  In June, Yury Petrov started as a research scientist at Apple. Previously, he had worked at Oculus, Facebook's virtual reality platform, and taught at Northeastern University. "I am a specialist in experimental psychology, human vision, optics for head-mounted displays, brain imaging, and mathematical methods of signal processing and analysis," according to his LinkedIn summary. (Virtual reality immerses viewers in a 360-degree computer-generated world, while augmented reality simply superimposes images on the real world.) Apple has a team of hundreds of staff building prototypes of potential headset configurations, the Financial Times reported in January.  Apple's hiring spree in this area really kicked off in May 2015, when it bought AR startup Metaio, an augmented reality startup. Metaio's CEO, Thomas Alt, still works at Apple, but he recently changed his focus from engineering to strategic deals. He is now a "director of procurement," according to his LinkedIn profile.      Meanwhile, iOS app developer Steven Troughton-Smith revealed that Apple has included several references to a "HeadMountedDisplayRenderingTechnique" in a key framework.  Apple should ape HoloLens; app platforms are their thing — leave VR to others. This has been in SceneKit since iOS 9 pic.twitter.com/kArfYIIHDI — Steve T-S (@stroughtonsmith) September 15, 2016   For sure, they should be working on an augmented reality computer before a car. The advances in SceneKit in iOS 10 seem designed for it — Steve T-S (@stroughtonsmith) September 15, 2016   If Apple is indeed working on an AR device, it'll have a lot of competition. Google kicked off the commercial AR field with Glass, and the company hasn't entirely given up on the concept, although there are continued signs of disarray in the latest version of the project. Plus, Google is a big investor in secretive AR startup MagicLeap, Microsoft has HoloLens, and Snapchat is quietly working on its own AR glasses. Know anything about Apple's AR project?

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    A Google-powered system of satellites is helping governments crack down on the practice of illegal fishing by spying on boats and fisheries. Google played a key role in the development of Global Fishing Watch, which uses satellites, receivers on land, and the locator systems on ships to keep watch on everything happening in the world's oceans, according to The Washington Post. The program is designed for governments, journalists, and ordinary citizens to keep an eye on fishing areas and whether or not ships are following the law. The program was launched Thursday, but the data that's available dates back four years. It can also be used by insurance companies who want to keep an eye on ships. Marine-advocacy group Oceana and SkyTruth, a nonprofit based in West Virginia, also helped develop the program. "We will be able to see a lot of information about who is fishing where," Jacqueline Savitz, vice president for U.S. oceans at Oceana, told the Post. "We're hoping it will be useful to a lot of different sectors." The platform, GlobalFishingWatch.org, is free and provides updates almost in real time. "Working with Oceana and Google has enabled us to take a good idea and build it into something that will improve the lives of hundreds of millions of people around the planet," John Amos, president and founder of SkyTruth, said in a press release. "Global Fishing Watch will catalyze the science, policy-making and public pressure necessary to make our oceans sustainable."

News UK Home News Google street view camera blurs cow's face in Cambridge Company blames ‘overzealous’ privacy technology for concealing the cow’s identity Harry Cockburn Thursday 15 September 2016 22:31 BST The cow in question Google Google’s street view cameras have protected the privacy of a cow in Cambridge by blurring its face out. The animal was photographed by the Google street view camera on a towpath at Coe Fen, in Cambridge. However, the software which is programmed to blur out human faces appears to have mistakenly given a passing cow the treatment. A tweet by The Guardian’s David Shariatmadari drew attention to the mysterious cow.

It has been liked more than 12,000 times. But the streetview camera didn’t immediately blur out the face of the cow. From a further distance, the cow’s white face and pink nose can be clearly seen. But as the camera gets closer to the grazing animal, the software apparently recognised it as human and blurred it out.  From further away, the cow's non-human face is clearly visible (Google) A spokesman for Google said: “We thought you were pulling the udder one when we herd the moos, but it's clear that our automatic face-blurring technology has been a little overzealous. “Of course, we don't begrudge this cow milking its five minutes of fame.” UK news in pictures 32 show all UK news in pictures 1/32 13 November 2016 Queen Elizabeth II lays a wreath during the annual Remembrance Sunday Service at the Cenotaph on Whitehall in London, England Getty 2/32 13 November 2016 The Prince of Wales arrives at the Guards' Chapel in Wellington Barracks, London for a service and to lay a wreath at the Guards' Memorial for the Welsh Guards' Regimental Remembrance Sunday PA wire 3/32 13 November 2016 British Prime Minister Theresa May, Jeremy Corbyn Leader of the Labour Party and Angus Robertson, Deputy Leader of the Scottish National Party with former British Prime Minister's David Cameron, Tony Blair and Sir John Major during the Remembrance Sunday ceremony at the Cenotaph in London, Britain EPA 4/32 13 November 2016 Prime Minister Theresa May, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, Liberal Democrats leader Tim Farron, and Westminster Leader of the Scottish National Party Angus Roberston take part in the Remembrance Sunday ceremony at the Cenotaph in Westminster, central London Reuters 5/32 13 November 2016 Veterans wait on Horse Guards Parade for the start of the Remembrance Sunday ceremony at the Cenotaph in Westminster, central London Reuters 6/32 13 November 2016 People across the UK gathered to pay tribute to service personnel who have died during conflicts, as part of the annual Remembrance Sunday ceremonies ge 7/32 13 November 2016 Members of Scotland's armed forces and veterans gather to commemorate and pay respect to the sacrifice of service men and women who fought in the two World Wars and subsequent conflicts in Fort William, Scotland Getty 8/32 12 November 2016 The 689th Lord Mayor of the City of London Andrew Parmley waves from his carriage during The Lord Mayor's Show Getty 9/32 12 November 2016 The Lord Mayor procession passes by St Pauls Cathedral in London EPA 10/32 12 November 2016 Spectators watch as the Lord Mayor of the City of London's carriage arrives outside the Royal Courts of Justice during the Lord Mayor's Show in London, England Getty 11/32 12 November 2016 The Lord Mayor's Show, now in its 801st year, makes its way from the City of London to the Royal Courts of Justice today in a display of pageantry featuring a 6,500 strong procession Getty 12/32 12 November 2016 Participants of the Lord Mayor's Show parade past St Paul's Cathedral Getty Images 13/32 9 November 2016 Dr. Christopher Moran, Chairman Co-operation Ireland, Arlene Foster, First Minister of Northern Ireland, Queen Elizabeth II, Martin McGuinness, Deputy First Minister of Northern Ireland and Frances Fitzgerald, Minister of Justice and Equality Gov of Ireland, attend a Co-Operation Ireland Reception at Crosby Hall in London, England.

As such, the company plans to phase out support for the apps on Windows, Mac and Linux over the next couple of years. While admitting that packaged apps are used by just 1 percent of users of the three platforms, Google says that the decision comes after a drive to integrate the feature of apps into web standards. Chrome apps will live on in Chrome OS "for the foreseeable future", but a wind-down timetable has been set out for everyone else. Nothing is changing immediately. But come late 2016, only Chrome OS users will be able to access newly published apps. There are no plans to hide existing apps from users, and updates will still be available for them. The ball really starts to get rolling in the second half of 2017 when Windows, Mac and Linux users will lose access to the apps in the Chrome Web Store. It seems as though it will still be possible to sideload apps at this stage as Google goes on to say that "in early 2018, users on these platforms will no longer be able to load Chrome apps". In a blog post announcing that the plug is due to be pulled on Chrome apps for most platforms, Google says: We believe it’s time to begin the evolution away from the Chrome apps platform. There are two types of Chrome apps: packaged apps and hosted apps. Today, approximately 1% of users on Windows, Mac and Linux actively use Chrome packaged apps, and most hosted apps are already implemented as regular web apps. We will be removing support for packaged and hosted apps from Chrome on Windows, Mac, and Linux over the next two years. Apps will continue to be supported on Chrome OS for now, but the message to Windows, Linux and Mac users is clear: it's time to move on: On Windows, Mac, and Linux, we encourage developers to migrate their Chrome apps to the web. Developers who can’t fully move their apps to the web can help us prioritize new APIs to fill the gaps left by Chrome apps. In the short term, they can also consider using a Chrome extension or platforms such as Electron or NW.js. For anyone using Chrome OS, there is a more immediate change -- but one that has less of an impact on users. As noted by OMG Chrome, there's a new Cortana-inspired icon to enjoy.

Collaborating with Queen and Enosis VR, Google calls the production "a journey through frontman Freddie Mercury's subconscious mind." Stylistically, the experience is a surrealistic and psychadelic journey that does indeed resonate with Mercury and Queen's persistently joyful and ebullient lyrics and sound. The experience follows the flow of the song, however, rising and falling with the melodic changes that accompany it. Though designed as a VR experience, the Bohemian Rhapsody Experience can be viewed as a regular 3D video as well. #1 INNOVATION KEYNOTE VIDEOS Join 5,000,0000 people getting Better & Faster w/ Jeremy Gutsche's Innovation Keynotes ➤ Related Top 10 Slideshows Video Pro Services Innovation Accelerator Innovation Keynotes Trend Reports Custom Dashboards Future Festival Free Resources Innovation Videos & Books Weekly Trend Report NEW: 2017 Trend Report Get a FREE Report Wildlife Protection SimulatorsWWF's Newest Tiger Conservation Campaign Leverages Virtual Reality Virtual Tennis ExperiencesJaguar Introduced a #FeelWimbledon Virtual Reality Experience VR Basketball Docs'Follow My Lead: The Story of the 2016 NBA Finals' is an Immersive Experience Presidential VR Conservation ExperiencesThis VR Experience Lets You Explore Nature With Obama 45 Political Marketing StuntsFrom Presidential Candidate Dolls to Political Food Trucks Top 75 Sports Trends in OctoberFrom Football Team Hashtag Emojis to Collaborative Tennis Apparel Stats for Rock Anthem VR Experiences Trending: This Quarter & Popular Research: 453 clicks in 8 w Interest: 1.8 minutes Concept: Bohemian Rhapsody Experience Related: 62 examples / 48 photos Segment: Neutral, 18-55+ Comparison Set: 23 similar articles, including: olympian vr experiences, wearable vr computers, and hockey fan festivals.

The animal was snapped by Google's camera as it grazed by the water at Coe Fen in Cambridge. And weirdly it was given the same privacy treatment as humans get when its face was blurred. The Guardian's David Shariatmadari tweeted the photo out on Monday and it has since been shared more than 9,000 times. He wrote: "Great to see Google takes cow privacy seriously." Tim Bale replied: “Had better milk that one for all it's worth." The blurred cow was spotted on Google Street View in the Coe Fen area of Cambridge (Photo: Google Street View) Google admitted its technology had been a little "overzealous" and mistook the bovine creature for a person due to movement sensors.

"Of course, we don't begrudge this cow milking its five minutes of fame." When Google launched in 2007 technology that automatically blurs people's faces was introduced to help combat privacy concerns.

The Coalition for Better Ads was announced by Google at a digital advertising trade show in Germany and is a direct response to the rise of adblockers. The group wants to score ads based on e.g their size and how much bandwidth they consume. Also usage of tracking pixels and the effect on pageload times is taken in account. Based on these criteria the advertisements receive a rating. Publishers that participate in the Coalition for Better Ads will only show advertisements that score above a certain threshold. This should make sure participating websites no longer show bad and annoying advertisements. The rating system should also become a new standard for online advertising. The first version of the standard is expected for the fourth quarter of this year. Besides Google also Unilever, The Washington Post, DMA, GroupM, Procter & Gamble and the European Publishers Council are part of the coalition.   Related Forum: Latest News Headlines Related Tags: google adblock Broadband provider starts to show TV commercials based on viewing and surfing habits Shuttle NC01U Mini PC Review Google Ads exec: Popularity of adblockers caused by ads with terrible user experience Cookie Policy DrageMester Retired Moderator Posted on: 15 Sep 16 19:58 Funnily enough, another news article posted just after this one, shows why people are going to continue using adblockers even if the quality of legit ads is improved: Zero-day leak in Internet Explorer and Edge actively abused since 2014 Quote: The zero-day leak in Internet Explorer and Edge, that was patched last Patch Tuesday, has been actively used to infect internet users since 2014. Users were infected by viewing malcious advertisements. 2 Agree Seán Senior Administrator & Reviewer Posted on: 15 Sep 16 21:16 Ad banners should be no more than a static image (or MP4 video clip for higher paid ads) that when clicked takes the user to the advertiser's website, nothing more.  This would make it incredibly difficult to deliver malicious advertisements as the malicious ads would need to find vulnerabilities in the JPEG, MP4, etc. file formats used by browsers. At present, most banners are iframes that are effectively a full-blown webpage including JavaScript, cookies, etc. loaded within the banner slot, which is a incredible waste of resources just to display an advert.  Just try inspecting the HTML source for an banner and it's crazy the amount of code and JavaScript most banners use, often more than the webpage they are displayed in.  1 Agree TSJnachos117 MyCE Resident Posted on: 15 Sep 16 21:33 Finally! I literally thought this day would never come. After all, many corporations in the tech industry have gone out of their way to not listen to their own customers. Online advertising has gotten too out of control, and needs to be pulled back somewhat. Now all we need to hear is that online advertisers are willing to take DNT headers into consideration. Unfortunately, it doesn't appear that these advertisers are going to start taking Do Not Track into account. Although DNT was intended as a way to opt-out of surveillance, it appears that Google and others are going to ignore it as they always have. Also, it doesn't appear they're going to do anything about ads that slow your computer down. You don't need a whole lot of bandwidth to download a RAM-hungry or CPU-hungry JS script. Still, at least they're doing something about tracking pixels. That's a very good start unto itself. They are also going to do something about ads that suck up users' bandwidth, which a much-needed course of action. Improved pageload times is always a good thing. 0 Agree Register Login Register to Myce.com Register in 10 seconds, pick a username, enter your mail address and proof you're human, that's all!

The Dalles Area Chamber of Commerce has been campaigning to get local business on the Google map for over a year, and are now offering a series of Tech Talks, offering information and one on one help from Google employees. Above, a T-shirt and other items of “swag” distributed during events by the chamber. Photo by Mark Gibson. By Mark Gibson As of Thursday, September 15, 2016 Sign in to favorite this Discuss Comment, Blog about Share this Email, Facebook, Twitter The Dalles Area Chamber of Commerce and Google are launching a first of its kind educational series for the community called “Tech Talk” on Oct. 5. The idea was sparked at this year’s Googlefest at the Fort Dalles Readiness Center, which introduced members of the business, nonprofit and educational community to Google tools and techniques that might benefit their work. “People were looking for one-on-one follow up,” explained chamber marketing and communication coordinator Tiffany Hardin. “They were introduced to all the tools, but were asking, ‘How do I implement that?’” The new Tech Talks, planned for every four months, are designed to help local individuals, nonprofits and small businesses learn how to take advantage of available technology. Attendees will learn tips and tricks for using free Google tools such as Gmail, Calendar, Hangouts and Google Docs. The first Tech Talk is scheduled for Wednesday, Oct. 5, from 5 to 6:30 p.m. and will focus on Gmail. The event will be held at Route 30 Bottles and Brews, 317 E. Second Street, The Dalles, with happy hour food and drink available for purchase. Attendees should plan to bring their laptop for this hands-on event, Hardin said. After a presentation on Gmail, local Google staff will be available for one-on-one assistance and support. The chamber has already co-hosted two “Google my Business” workshops, and the Tech Talk events will also give those attending the opportunity to validate their business and get it on the Google map of The Dalles. “Getting your business on the map involves an approval process through Google by proving ownership, which allows business owners to edit the information presented by Google. “It gives people the opportunity to keep their information updated,” she said. “Your business will have a pin, you are right there on their map, when someone looks at a Google map of town.” The two Google map workshops attracted about 60 people each. The process can be done online, which combines online information with postal confirmation, but if you provide proof you own your business at a workshop you can be approved on the spot, Hardin explained. Business owners must bring original proof of ownership documents such as utility bills, tax letters, and/or business registration certificates. Registered agents of the business may also bring photo identification and have ownership verified through the Secretary of State’s website. Attendees should RSVP by Sept. 30 with TheDallesChamber.com. The subsequent Tech Talk is scheduled for Jan. 11, 2017, with the location to be announced. Future events are planned to span a range of time frames, so those who can attend in the morning, at noon or evening will have a chance to attend an event that fits their schedule. October’s topic, Gmail, was one a lot of people were asking about that during Googlefest, Hardin said. Hardin added that she has had a lot of positive feedback from the business community on the chamber/Google sponsored events. “Our local business community is very responsive to this,” she said. Over time, the chamber and the business community have developed a strong relationship with Google, which operates a growing data center at the Port of The Dalles. “We have an amazing relationship with them, they are super open to any idea we might have,” she said. “It’s great having them in our backyard, and willing to work with the community.” The Dalles may even help start a bigger trend: “We will be the first community to offer this,” she said of the Tech Talk forum. She believes the one-on-one portion of the event will be especially helpful. “It’s not every day you get to sit down with a Google professional to get help.” More like this story ‘Googlefest’ explores online tools Google offers workshops Google reveals newest data center Google is a part of the community, growth should be supported Google breaks new ground in The Dalles Comments Use the comment form below to begin a discussion about this content.

At Google I/O in May, the company announced it would be bringing a device-local safe browsing application programming interface (API) to developers, and that day has finally arrived. But what is a ‘device-local safe browsing API’? It is basically a way for developers to use the same protections that Google uses on the web and it determines whether a link is safe to visit or if it has been previously marked as a known threat on Google’s list. Examples of sites that would not be considered safe include social phishing websites that attempt to get login information from you, as well as sites that host malware. The API is aimed at being extremely easy to implement within an app. Related: Google sneaks in upgrade of Safe Browsing API, says it’s been guarding some users for months “Since our initial launch we’ve shown hundreds of millions of warnings, actively warning many millions of mobile users about badness before they’re exposed to it,” Google employees wrote in a blog post. “We look forward to all Android developers extending this same protection to their users, too.” Of course, as a mobile API, it is also built to keep battery use and bandwidth consumption as low as possible. Another great thing about the new API is that it is being rolled out in the latest version of Google Play Services, meaning all developers can take advantage of it and  it can be used on older devices — even those dating back as far as Android 2.3. The API also uses the latest version of the Safe Browsing protocol, which basically means that it acts as quickly as possible — also saving on cellular data. Apps using the API are able to specify exactly which threats to avoid — malware, phishing, or both.

 Google Maps is the 'Swiss army knife' of the company's smart assistant future Jillian D'Onfro Sep. 15, 2016, 4:22 PM 11,506 facebook linkedin twitter email print Google's Jen Fitzpatrick Google Over the last several months, Google has mapped out a vision of its future where you'll have a smart assistant following you from phone to wrist to flatscreen and beyond, conversationally answering your questions and proactively serving up advice, like when to leave for the comedy show you searched for the night before. While tech giants like Amazon, Microsoft, Apple, and Facebook are all also eyeing some version of this AI-assistant powered world, Google CEO Sundar Pichai has consistently highlighted one of the things that sets Google's efforts apart: Its geographic data. If Google's smart assistant ambitions center around giving you the right information at exactly the right time, Google Maps provides the keys to context. Its combination of rich geographic, business, and personalized location data can be paired with information from all of Google's other services like Gmail and Search to create an assistant that (Google hopes) you'll actually want to use. Figuring out the best ways to improve that data and put it to use falls to Jen Fitzpatrick, who has led the Maps division since fall 2014. “Maps is a pretty incredible swiss army knife of a product,” she tells Business Insider. “One of the things we'e thinking a lot about is, ‘How do we take all of the goodness packed within it and bring the right part of that tool to the surface in the moment that's right for you?'" The 'deepest, most detailed understanding of the real world that's ever existed' Google relies on "Trekkers" to go where its Street View cars can't. Google Fitzpatrick has worked at Google since before it even acquired the basis for Maps, Where2 Technologies, in 2004. She joined the "crazy little startup" as one of its first interns in 1999 and led software development on products like AdWords and Google News before heading to Maps.  Back then, there were a lot fewer tech companies with an interest in maps.  In just the last two years, major companies like Tesla, Uber, and, most relevantly, Apple have doubled down on their mapping efforts. Google's on notice. “It reinforces that we can't stand still,” Fitzpatrick says. “We feel an incredible sense of urgency to not just take what we have and keep it going, but to set the bar higher and be the ones who define what the next generation of maps is going to look like.” The first part of her goal to build “the richest, deepest, most detailed understanding of the real world that's ever existed” is getting all the data right. Google When Business Insider spoke to Fitzpatrick she had just completed a presentation thanking a handful of its most-dedicated “Local Guides,” the volunteers who add and edit millions of Maps data points for restaurants, shops, landmarks, and more.   She told them that their contributions are helping Google get closer to being able to serve recommendations for complex queries like "tourist-friendly nightclubs in Vienna that play Senegalese music." The second part is finding new kinds of data to take in. Maps already uses anonymized info from anyone with the app open or location services turned on to crowdsource real-time traffic and predictions, but Fitzpatrick thinks that there are new opportunities ahead too. Her division just bought UrbanEngines, a startup that analyzes the “Internet of Moving Things,” and Maps is looking for new ways to incorporate live information about events or natural disasters. Plus, she says that we're “just at the beginning” of seeing a third-party ecosystem on top of Maps. Although she didn't get into specifics, we've already seen Google rolling out more integrations in the last year, from letting you use OpenTable to make a restaurant reservations to prompting ride-hailing services like Uber and Lyft into the directions section of the app. “We are just at the beginning of what I consider to be the ‘next chapter’ of Google Maps,” she says. Getting personal While some of Google's smart assistant ambitions require pretty basic location knowledge — like giving you a satisfying answer to “How tall is that statue in front of me?” or making your phone bleep at you to leave for work early to make your first meeting because there’s traffic — it gets more interesting when you consider things like recommendations. Google If you have your location history turned on, Google's has been building a little profile about all the places you've been. (And here's how to turn it on or off.) Looking at my history, Google reminded me that I went to Papa Razzi, an Italian restaurant in Concord, MA, on September 9, 2013. Thanks to all the data that Paparazzi staff and various visitors have recorded about that business, Google can make some teeny-tiny inferences about my preferences. Now multiply that by the gazillion stores and restaurants that I’ve visited. “It’s about being able to understand more about you and your context and your preferences and the places that you’ve been before and using that to be able to make better recommendations and suggestions to you,” Fitzpatrick says. When future-me asks my Google assistant where I could host my 27th birthday party, Maps could pull info about places that take large reservations and have available tables on my desired night, ranked by how well they fit with my profile of tastes. It's easy to picture how ads could fit into this model too: If you always go to Thai restaurants, a new spot that opened in your neighborhood could pay to have your smart assistant suggest checking it out next time you walk by. Google Maps is already testing "promoted pins" that offer deals, but, for now, they're not personalized. "We're trying to think about what are the next opportunities to make location even more central to an advertising experiences," Fitzpatrick says.  Right now, Google hasn't actually released its "Home" speaker or messaging app Allo, the first two Assistant-powered products that it announced at its giant developers conference in May. But they're coming soon and when they do, it will be Maps and its data doing much of the work under the hood.  SEE ALSO: Google killed off a part of its speedy delivery service to prepare for its next big expansion: blanketing the whole country NOW WATCH: These size comparisons show the true scale of enormous things Loading video...

It’s quite possibly why the company is taking an “Apple-like direction” for its Nexus phones. Still, when the company does produce ads, they almost always tug at your heart strings. Google uploaded a slew of ads for its new video messaging app, Duo, overnight on its YouTube channel — they’re all heart-warming and adorable, and do a great job of showcasing the app’s purpose. The app recently hit 10 million downloads on the Google Play Store, though it has fallen quite far down the top charts. Related: Google’s ‘Friends Furever’ ad just became the most shared ad of all time The videos feature real-life doodles on every day objects, like salt and pepper shakers, socks, and peanut butter and jelly. These objects use Duo to video chat with their counterparts and have anthropomorphic conversations — they’re seriously cute, and you should definitely check them out. It’s unclear if these ads will air on TV, but we have reached out to Google for confirmation. Google’s last marketing campaign was a hit. The search giant put Android front and center, and launched the “Be together. Not the same” slogan to unite and highlight the differences between Android smartphones. One particular ad featured animals making unlikely friendships — including an orangutan and a dog, a bear and a tiger, and more. That “Friends Furever” video became the most shared advertisement of 2015, hitting 6.4 million shares at the time. These anthropomorphic objects aren’t cute animals, but can they make a similar impression? We’ll have to wait and see.

Why You Should Upgrade Right Now iPhone and iPad iOS 10 Is Here! Why You Should Upgrade Right Now Tim Brookes September 15, 2016 15-09-2016 8 minutes iOS 10 Is Here! Why You Should Upgrade Right Now Facebook Twitter Pinterest Stumbleupon Whatsapp Email Ads by Google Apple’s tenth revision of its mobile operating system is here, and you can upgrade right now for free. The same thing happens every year — Apple announces a new iPhone Everything You Need to Know About the iPhone 7 & iPhone 7 Plus Everything You Need to Know About the iPhone 7 & iPhone 7 Plus No headphone port, water and dust resistance, and Apple's best camera yet -- this is the iPhone 7. Read More , then a week later, the device is released to the public along with an update for existing iPhone, iPad and iPod touch owners. There are only a few major changes this time round, but developers have had about three months to implement some of the new features into their apps. So here’s how, why, and which devices can take advantage of the new software. Siri Is Much More Useful iOS 10 heralds the arrival of SiriKit for developers, which allows Siri to control your third party apps in the same way that Apple’s core services do Make the Most of Hands-Free "Hey Siri" on Your iPhone or iPad Make the Most of Hands-Free "Hey Siri" on Your iPhone or iPad Here's how Apple's hands-free "Hey Siri" command can make your life easier. Read More . For the first time ever, you can get Siri to send a message with WhatsApp, LinkedIn, WeChat, or Slack: “Tell John I’m on my way now with WhatsApp.” If you have multiple contacts with the same name, Siri will ask you which one you meant. You can do other smart things too like search for pictures of cats on Pinterest, pay people real money with Square Cash, and order a ride via Lyft or Uber. It’s not a third-party free for all (yet) however, as SiriKit only works with six types of apps: audio and video calling, messaging, mobile payments, searching photos, fitness apps, and transportation services like Uber. That means you won’t be able to control Spotify with Siri any time soon (only Apple Music gets that privilege 9 Tips for a Better Apple Music Experience on iOS & OS X 9 Tips for a Better Apple Music Experience on iOS & OS X There's a lot Apple doesn't tell you about Apple Music. Here are some of the best tricks for making the most of your tunes. Read More ). Thankfully, the ability to send messages from any supported apps and ordering a ride is genuinely useful, and while SiriKit perhaps isn’t as fleshed out as many of us (and developers) might like, it’s a promising sign of what Apple wants its smart assistant to be in future. Ads by Google Delete the Stock Apps You Don’t Want You moaned and Apple listened. Once you upgrade to iOS 10 you can delete a whole heap of pre-installed stock applications rather than burying them in a folder you’ve named with the poop emoji. The full list of Apple apps you can delete are: Calculator, Calendar, Compass, Contacts, FaceTime, Find My Friends, Home, iBooks, iCloud Drive, iTunes Store, Mail, Maps, Music, News, Notes, Podcasts, Reminders, Stocks, Tips, Videos, Voice Memos, Watch, and Weather. There are a few interesting ones in there. You can delete the FaceTime front end, but you’ll still be able to make and receive FaceTime calls from the Contacts app and other parts of the OS (you’re basically deleting the shortcut). The same is true for iCloud Drive, which is merely a shortcut to a folder view of your Apple cloud storage Is It Finally Time to Buy More iCloud Storage? Is It Finally Time to Buy More iCloud Storage? Now that iCloud storage costs considerably less than it used to, it might be time to upgrade beyond 5GB. Read More . If you want to get those apps back, just search for them on the App Store where you can download them free of charge. Send More Exciting Messages The Messages app has been updated to include a bunch of colorful features, like the ability to send animated text bubbles and full-screen effects. This is all done via the “up arrow” send button, which you can Force Touch (or long-press on non-3D Touch devices) to reveal the Bubble menu with a bunch of options. For text bubbles you can “Slam” your message onto the screen, yell it with “Loud”, or send an invisible message which is pixellated until the recipient swipes across the screen. This menu also includes a tab for Screen effects which includes Balloons, Lasers, and Confetti for those special moments that require them. You’ll also find a full App Store under the > button, where you can download sticker packs and send them to your contacts, or send money or your now playing song in a few taps. When typing messages, certain words are able to be replaced with emojis — just tap your emoji button and any word that changes to gold can then be tapped to substitute it for an emoji instead. #ios10 went from bang bang to squirt squirt pic.twitter.com/QxKOosYIvh — TED (@Laughbook) September 14, 2016 You can also send a handwritten message by turning your device landscape (just hit the squiggly line if the feature doesn’t show up automatically). It’s also possible to drop stickers on images that have been sent, or draw all over a photo and send it back using the Markup tool. We’ll take a detailed look at all of these new features in an upcoming article. Better Interface, Notifications, Lock Screen Even after iOS 7’s “flat” interface redesign, iOS notifications haven’t really evolved much beyond a few canned responses like the ability to favorite a tweet or quickly reply to a message. That changes with iOS 10, which include real-time data within these lock screen notifications — the classic example being an Uber notification which shows you where your driver is in real-time, without having to unlock your phone or launch the app. Settings –> General –> Accessibility –> Home Button *RT to save a life* #iOS10 #slidetounlock pic.twitter.com/nNEl4q51Kj — caleb (@CalebH92) September 14, 2016 You can do other stuff too. Either Force Touch a notification (or swipe-left across it and choose View on older devices) to see the last few messages within a conversation, or get more options pertaining to the app that’s notifying you. Things act a little differently when your phone is unlocked — swipe down from the top of the screen to interact with the app without having to leave the app you’re currently using. This is improved on the functionality in iOS 9, which included the feature but was limited in terms of messaging (for example) in that you could only reply to that notification directly. Now you can peek directly inside the app and see other messages without having to launch it at all. A new lock screen allows you to swipe left to access the camera and swipe right for access to your widgets. You now need to press the home button to unlock, but you can simply raise your phone to check notifications without having to press a button. Search Your Pictures Properly Apple is also introducing a vastly improved way to search and sort your photos in iOS 10. By employing a similar level of learning as seen in the cloud-based Google Photos Get Free Unlimited Photo Storage & More with Google Photos Get Free Unlimited Photo Storage & More with Google Photos If you aren't using these hidden Google Photos features, you're really missing out. (Hint: There's free and unlimited photo storage!) Read More , the Photos app is now able to recognise people, objects, and allow you to search by these parameters to better find what you’re looking for. There are two new albums under the Albums tab too: People and Places. The app can now learn who the people in your images are, and use geotagging information to plot all your images on a map so you can sort by location (something you’ve always been able to do, but it wasn’t necessarily obvious in the post-iOS 7 update). The memories feature for your photos in iOS 10 is pretty legit pic.twitter.com/xaQHUxgsW4 — Matt Ng (@yingfo) September 8, 2016 There’s also a new Memories tab that creates videos based on connected images, allowing you to customize and share it with your friends if you want to. Apple Music & News Facelifts Certainly not the biggest deal for every iOS user, but nice nonetheless. If you use Apple Music you will be treated to a new interface and improved user experience — something that’s also coming to macOS Sierra too. The News app has also had a redesign, and now features Apple Music-like tabs at the bottom of the screen and the ability to subscribe to certain news sources. All the Small Things Apple Maps gets a new interface and looks a lot nicer, with a few new features like live traffic and the ability for other developers to integrate their apps.

Let's look into the benefits – some new, and some old – which can help us make sense of the world around us. Read More or not remains to be seen. You can now shoot RAW photos using your iPhone, but you’ll need an iPhone 6s, 6s Plus, SE, 7 or 7 Plus to take advantage of the feature (presumably because RAW files are huge and it’s difficult for older devices to keep up when capturing that much data). At present you’ll need an app like Lightroom or Obscura ($7.99). A universal clipboard feature is coming when macOS Sierra launches on the 20th of September, but it should work already if you’re running the public beta. You can also type in multiple languages to avoid autocorrection errors if you’re bilingual or feeling a little avant garde. A new smart-home-focused Home app brings all your HomeKit devices together under one interface. You can control connected plugs, smart lighting, thermostats, and more without relying on a separate app for each. And of course plenty of security updates (especially if you haven’t updated in a while) and hundreds of hidden tweaks under the hood. How Do I Upgrade? Not all iOS devices will support the update, and this time round sees Apple drop support for the ageing iPhone 4s which simply doesn’t have the hardware to play nicely with iOS 10. If you own an iPhone 4s, iOS 9 is your last free upgrade! The full list of supported hardware is: iPhone: 5, 5c, 5s, SE, 6, 6 Plus, 6s, 6s Plus, 7 or 7 Plus. iPad: 4th gen, Air, Air 2, Pro, mini 2, mini 3, mini 4. iPod Touch: 5th & 6th gen. To upgrade your device, head to Settings > General > Software Update and wait for the download and installation process to complete. Just in case something goes wrong, you should back up your iPhone in iTunes Everything You Need to Know About Backing Up & Restoring Your iPhone from iTunes Everything You Need to Know About Backing Up & Restoring Your iPhone from iTunes Most iPhone users take for granted that the contents of their iPhone is backed up wirelessly to their iCloud account, but it is still useful to know how to restore your iPhone from iTunes.

If you back up to iCloud, you already have a copy of your data in the cloud, but local backups are much faster to restore and will get you back on your feet in less time than a large download from Apple’s servers. You can also perform the update from within iTunes on the Summary tab if you want. Keep in mind that demand will be high over the first few days, and you might experience slow downloads or an inability to contact the servers altogether. Once you’ve installed iOS 10 and rebooted your device, you’ll need to sign in to most services again as your login tokens will have expired — this includes iCloud, the App Store, email accounts, and third-party apps like Evernote and Slack.

They emphasise reliability, and cross-platform support. While it might superficially look like a Chromecast, they’re quite different. Currently retailing at $300, this certainly isn’t a cheap option. The makers of AirTame are not afraid to have their device compared to an ChromeCast or Apple TV, however. Enter below to win an Airtame for yourself! Airtame Wireless HDMI Giveaway Setup Experience In the box you’ll find: Ads by Google The AirTame dongle. Micro-USB power cable. USB adapter with worldwide plugs. HDMI extension cable, as the AirTame itself is quite wide. Initial setup requires a Mac or Windows PC capable of connecting to the ad-hoc Wi-Fi. They sell a $25 Ethernet adapter if you’d rather set up from a central location, or have sketchy Wi-Fi connections. I was pleasantly surprised by the sheer amount of configuration options that Airtame offers. You can set the ad-hoc Wi-Fi network on 2.4Ghz or 5Ghz channels, and even manually specify the channel. Crucially, the Airtame supports WPA2 Enterprise security, something which Chromecast notably lacks. By default a connection guide is also displayed over HDMI, useful for guests and employees who don’t want to refer to an Excel sheet of passwords or conference room guide just to connect their laptop to the projector. They will need the app installed (it’s not native to the OS), but this does ensure cross-compatibility regardless of which OS they’re using. You can configure the display to show a static custom image, or more excitingly, a URL – and disable the guide text if you want to display it fullscreen. This makes it incredibly easy to show a dashboard or digital signage without any further setup – and still maintain its ability to transform into a streaming player for presentations and such. They added a PIN code option in the most recent update. A random PIN is displayed on the screen, so this restricts streaming to only those physically located in the room. How is Airtame Different to Apple TV or Chromecast? Looking superficially like a more expensive Chromecast Thinking of Buying a Chromecast? Buy a Stick PC Instead Thinking of Buying a Chromecast? Buy a Stick PC Instead The Chromecast is a wonderful little gadget. However, it has some issues that could mean it's not the right choice for you. True geeks should consider buying a stick PC instead. Read More or Apple TV, the three devices are quite unique. Airtame addresses a number of comparisons in a remarkably unbiased way on their site, so be sure to read Airtame vs Apple TV or Airtame vs Chromecast for more information. I must say it’s refreshing to find a company that’s not afraid to compare it’s products without downplaying the competition and hiding key facts. KPI Dashboards and Informational Displays KPI (Key Performance Indicator) dashboards Create A Killer Website Analytics Dashboard With Google Core Reporting API Create A Killer Website Analytics Dashboard With Google Core Reporting API Would you like to just publish a site and run it blindly, or would you like a full-featured, functional dashboard that shows you what's going on with the site at all times? Read More are really simple to set up with Airtame. In fact, you can display anything that’s available at a public URL. To be clear, Airtame doesn’t offer a dashboard service themselves, but the device will work with any third party service that offers a publicly accessible URL. There’s no support for authentication at the moment, and there’s also restriction on complex web content like Flash. To test this, I used TheDash.com to build a basic display consisting of news, real-time visitor count from our Google Analytics account, local weather and a Twitter search stream. I then grabbed the fullscreen URL (https://www.thedash.com/dashboard/Bkvcx7Gq/fullscreen) and pasted this into the AirTame configuration on the Display tab. After applying the settings, it worked and data was refreshed as expected, as it would be in a regular browser. Streaming Performance and Mirroring I tested mirroring and media performance primarily on a Mac laptop, with both the laptop and AirTame connected to my 5Ghz home Wi-Fi. Connecting directly to the device’s own Wi-Fi will (in theory) give better performance. In testing, I found very little difference, so I assume my home Wi-Fi isn’t that congested. Audio streaming is also possible, though it adds a couple of seconds buffer to ensure uninterrupted playback. Though desktop mirroring of slideshows and presentations or webpages works well, Airtame isn’t suitable as a movie playback device due to the way it handles streaming. It mirrors your desktop by capturing the screen 30 times a second – there’s some obvious compression going on for that to work, so video playback quality suffers from artefacts, particularly during action-heavy scenes. As well as the ability to setup a URL that all AirTame devices can display, you can simultaneously transmit to multiple Airtame devices at the same time, though only from the desktop app. Mobile Support Out of the box, iOS integration is weak, with a limited set of options: photos, dropbox, or files. “Files” actually just means PDFs. Although the support pages claim that mobile apps work with Keynote, this isn’t completely true. You have to first export from Keynote as a PDF file, then load that into the app. Dropbox integration allows you open a Keynote file, but this is converted to a PDF in the background. Of course, you lose the beautiful transitions in the process. Once you’ve exported your PDF slideshow , giving a presentation couldn’t be easier. The app includes a timer, so you can keep pace. There’s no option to mirror your iOS screen as you might with AirPlay. Although technically possible – there are third party hardware devices out there with hacked in AirPlay support – it’s not official. Integrating such unofficial hacks would risk having their app banned from the store entirely. If you’re happy with PDF as a format for your presentations, it’s never been easier to carry a single device with you. You can display your presentations or slideshow on any screen, wirelessly, with just your mobile device and an Airtame. That’s a killer feature right there, for travelling salesman and entrepreneurial types. Even so, I can’t help thinking the iOS app could benefit from a little more development. The situation on Android is similar, though it’s at least more likely that future updates will enable device mirroring. Should You Buy an Airtame? By their own admission, Airtame isn’t really suited to home users who are mainly interested in video streaming. It’s aimed at enterprise and business customers,  who need reliability and central device management. Airtame offers cross-platform support and ease of use. Airtame Wireless HDMI Display Adapter for Businesses & Education Airtame Wireless HDMI Display Adapter for Businesses & Education Airtame is a small wireless HDMI device that plugs into the HDMI port of any screen or projector. Unlike other wireless HDMI devices, nothing is plugged into your computer or smartphone. Buy Now At Amazon $275.00 For strictly video-streaming in the home environment then, you’re better off with a ChromeCast or Apple TV. Though they have their differences, both will stream media resources directly, rather than relying on screen-capture technology; and both are significantly cheaper than Airtame. For the same price as an Airtame, you could buy two ChromeBits What Is the Chromebit and Is It Better Than the Intel Compute Stick? What Is the Chromebit and Is It Better Than the Intel Compute Stick? What is the Chromebit? How does it work? And how does it stack up against its main competition, the Intel Compute Stick? Let's find out. Read More . These run a full version of Chrome OS in the same diminutive dongle format. Where Airtame really excels is quickly and reliably getting a presentation from any device onto the big screen. It’s also great in multi-device networks. It offers a number of connectivity options, and all of them “just work”. They can all be centrally managed, and Airtame is working on a new cloud service for remote management. The requirement to download a driver application first is fine for intra-company use, but does present a minor barrier for clients visiting your offices. Before guest can stream to your displays, they’ll need to download the app. There is no built-in AirPlay or Miracast support. That said, I’ve had horrible experiences with so called cross-platform streaming protocols like Miracast. Airtame has chosen to concentrate on developing a proprietary protocol which does actually work. Just remember to send you clients a link to the software before they arrive. It also supports Wi-Fi forwarding, so the Airtame can act as a mini-router. When your guests connect to the ad-hoc network, they’ll have internet access (if you allow it). Airtame is also a powerful tool for distributing informational displays or KPI dashboards around your company offices, while maintaining that flexibility to stream to them at any point. Our verdict of the Airtame: There’s no better device for streaming presentations and slideshows wirelessly in schools and offices. However, home users wanting to just stream Netflix should look elsewhere.810 Previous PostGoogle Pixel C Review and GiveawayNext PostArduino Project Handbook Review & Giveaway 4 comments Write a Comment Alan October 19, 2016 at 12:48 am Fraud: Lying with the intended result of financial gain.

CLOSE Home News Opinion Pulse Arts & Entertainment Sports Wednesday, November 16, 2016 About Advertising Business Directory Archive Support Us Home News Opinion Pulse Arts & Entertainment Sports Home Opinion Autonomous vehicles are rising to new levels Autonomous vehicles are rising to new levels By Mark Lewis - September 15, 2016 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter On March 13, 2004, the U.S. Defense Department’s Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or DARPA, held a “Grand Challenge” event for autonomous cars. The bar was pretty low; the cars were supposed to drive 150 miles across the Mojave desert and didn’t have to worry about traffic, pedestrians or even staying on roads. Despite this, not a single team finished. Indeed, no car made it to the 8-mile mark. Five years later, Google began working on an autonomous car project. As of June 2016, their vehicles have logged over 1.7 million miles. Google isn’t the only company making self-driving cars. Indeed, every major car maker in the world is putting significant effort into keeping up. Some are further than others. Tesla boldly included an autopilot mode in their vehicles in late 2015 and many drivers have since pushed the technology beyond what Tesla recommends, including one who was killed this summer when his car ran into a truck that turned in front of him on a highway. Rapid changes in this field continue. Late this summer, Uber announced that they would begin testing a self-driving taxi service in Pittsburgh, while a company called NuTonomy is doing the same in Singapore. This summer, Ford announced plans to release a fully autonomous car by 2021 for sale to car fleets for companies like Uber and NuTonomy. To be clear, the term “fully autonomous” here means that these cars will not have steering wheels or pedals. There will be no mechanism for humans to drive them — they only drive themselves. Of course, there are many who argue that actual use of this technology is still far off in the future. Some argue that regulatory obstacles and issues over insurance and figuring out who pays for wrecks will slow things down. Traffic laws are written by states in the U.S. though, and not all states are moving slowly. Perhaps in an attempt to maintain what dominance they still have in the car market, Michigan is already moving to make driverless cars legal. The biggest hurdle might turn out to be the miserable state of transportation infrastructure in the U.S., but even that turns out to be more of a speed bump than a wall in the road. It only means that these cars will need to be able to navigate using more than just cameras. So what are the implications of this rush to make cars that drive themselves, beyond freeing me of the drudgery of my morning commute? One of the bigger ones early on will be the impact on the economy. Uber has already been disrupting taxi services, but their real long-term goal is not to empower drivers, but to obviate them. There are fewer than a quarter million taxi drivers in the U.S., so the likes of Uber and NuTonomy are not going to tank the economy. The bigger economic impact will come from autonomous trucks. There are roughly 3.5 million people employed as some type of truck driver in the U.S. Truck driving is the most common job in 29 states. The automation of truck driving will also reach out further than just taking the jobs of nearly 1.4 percent of the adult U.S. population. The impact on all the towns along interstates that largely exist to serve truck drivers and other people driving long distances will also be significant. Rest assured, this isn’t some call to try to stop the advance of technology. That is not a fruitful option. Better to put time, effort and money into figuring out how to keep people integrated into society when they are displaced from jobs by technology. Plus, while the short-term implications for employment might seem scary, the long-term view of how this might impact society is far more interesting. It will take time, but there will come a point where humans are not allowed to drive on public roads, just like you cannot ride a horse down U.S. 281 today. That time might not even be all that far in the future. Those Google cars that have logged over 1.7 million miles have only been partially responsible for one wreck. Even without legislation, insurance premiums on human driven cars will far exceed those on autonomous cars, and services that look like a blend of Uber and ZipCar will make it far more reasonable for most people to not bother to own cars. Once you get the humans out of the driver seat, the very nature of transportation changes. Cars begin to talk to one another directly. Street lights disappear as cars can decide on their own which one should go through. They can also weave between one another without either direction bothering to come to a full stop. Autonomy also removes the restriction that vehicles have to be large enough to carry humans around comfortably and safely. Your groceries or that package you ordered online really do not need a large vehicle to get them to your front door. A small cargo pod on wheels is all they really need, and the ability to communicate directly with the larger vehicles that are transporting humans or large amounts of material allows them to fit right into the flow of traffic without causing hazards. Transportation is just one of the many facets of our lives that technology is in the process of redefining. These changes are going to cause challenges, but that doesn’t mean that we should oppose them or try to prevent them from happening. Instead, we should all think about how we can seize these changes as opportunities, both for ourselves, and for society as a whole. Change is often painful, but that does not mean it has to be for the worse.

All rights reserved Terms of use Privacy Sitemap The Intercept_ f t ✉ ⎕ 39 Illustration: Scott Gelber for The Intercept Tech Money Lurks Behind Government Privacy Conference Sam Biddle Sam Biddle 2016-09-15T18:52:35+00:00 Illustration: Scott Gelber for The Intercept In January, academic-turned-regulator Lorrie Cranor gave a presentation and provided the closing remarks at PrivacyCon, a Federal Trade Commission event intended to “inform policymaking with research,” as she put it. Cranor, the FTC’s chief technologist, neglected to mention that over half of the researchers who presented that day had received financial support from Google — hardly a neutral figure in the debate over privacy. Cranor herself got an “unrestricted gift” of roughly $350,000 from the company, according to her CV. Virtually none of these ties were disclosed, so Google’s entanglements at PrivacyCon were not just extensive, they were also invisible. The internet powerhouse is keenly interested in influencing a lot of government activity, including antitrust regulation, telecommunications policy, copyright enforcement, online security, and trade pacts, and to advance that goal, has thrown around a lot of money in the nation’s capital. Ties to academia let Google attempt to sway power less directly, by giving money to university and graduate researchers whose work remains largely within academic circles — until it gains the audience of federal policymakers, as at PrivacyCon. Some research at the event supported Google’s positions. An MIT economist who took Google money, for example, questioned whether the government needed to intervene to further regulate privacy when corporations are sometimes incentivized to do so themselves. Geoffrey Manne, the executive director of a Portland-based legal think tank that relies on funding from Google (and a former Microsoft employee), presented a paper saying that “we need to give some thought to self-help and reputation and competition as solutions” to privacy concerns “before [regulators start] to intervene.” (Manne did not return a request for comment.) Other research presented at PrivacyCon led to conclusions the company would likely dispute. The problem with Google’s hidden links to the event is not that they should place researchers under automatic suspicion, but rather that the motives of corporate academic benefactors should always be suspect. Without prominent disclosure of corporate money in academia, it becomes hard for the consumers of research to raise important questions about its origins and framing. Google declined to comment on the record for this article. How Tech Money Flows to Privacy Scholars Google’s ties to PrivacyCon are pervasive enough to warrant interrogation. As a case study in how pervasive and well-concealed this type of influence has become, PrivacyCon is hard to beat. Authors of a whopping 13 out of 19 papers presented at the conference and 23 out of 41 speakers have financial ties to Google. Only two papers included disclosure of an ongoing or past financial connection to Google. Other tech companies are also financially linked to speakers at the event. At least two presenters took money from Microsoft,` while three others are affiliated with a university center funded by Amazon, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, and Twitter. “Are we getting voices that have never received money from a company like Google?” — Paul Ohm, Georgetown But Google’s corporate adversaries are helping to shine a spotlight on what their fellow travelers describe as Google’s particularly deep ties to academia. Those ties are a major focus of a new report from an entity called the Google Transparency Project, part of a charitable nonprofit known as the Campaign for Accountability. The Campaign for Accountability, in turn, receives major, undisclosed funding from Google nemesis and business software company Oracle, as well as from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which was set up by the co-founder and longtime CEO of Google rival Microsoft (the nonprofit says its funding sources have no bearing on its work to expose funding sources). The Intercept, meanwhile, operates with funding from eBay founder Pierre Omidyar. In other words, tech money even pervades the research into everything tech money pervades. But even accepting that, the report does highlight the extent to which Silicon Valley is widening its influence at the intersection of academia and government. Take MIT professor Catherine Tucker, who in one PrivacyCon paper argued against proposed government regulations requiring genetic testing services to obtain a type of written permission known as “informed consent” from patients. Tucker added that such a requirement would deter patients from using the testing services and specifically cited one such service, 23andMe, a firm that Google has invested in repeatedly, most recently in October, and whose CEO is the ex-wife of Google co-founder Sergey Brin. Tucker did not disclose in the paper that she has received over $150,000 in grants from Google since 2009, plus another $49,000 from the Net Institute, a think tank funded in part by Google. Contacted by email, Tucker answered that she discloses “nearly two pages of grants from, and consulting work for, a variety of companies and other organizations, on my CV.” Google has been appreciative of Tucker’s conference work. In a series of emails between Google and George Mason University law professor James Cooper for a 2012 policy conference, first reported by Salon, a Google representative went so far as to personally recommend the marketing professor as someone to invite: Cooper did not return multiple requests for comment on this story. Reached for comment via email, Cranor replied that she lists “the funder(s) in the acknowledgments of the specific papers that their grant funded,” and that there “have also been press releases about most of the Google funding I received, so everything has been fully disclosed in multiple places.” Cranor added that “all of these grants are made to Carnegie Mellon University for use in my research,” and “I did not receive any of this money personally.” But it is surely worth noting that one of the press releases Cranor references says that “each funded project receives an individual Google sponsor to help develop the research direction and facilitate collaboration between Google and the research team.” Cranor did not reply when asked what role “an individual Google sponsor” has played in her research. Nick Feamster, a Princeton professor, presented at PrivacyCon on internet-connected household objects and did not disclose that he’s received over $1.5 million in research support from Google. Over email, Feamster told The Intercept that any notion of a conflict “doesn’t even make any sense given the nature of the content we presented,” which included descriptions of security shortcomings in the Nest smart thermostat, owned by Google. “If they were really trying to exert the ‘influence’ that the [report] is trying to suggest, do you think they would have influenced us to do work that actually calls them out on bad privacy practices?” Many other PrivacyCon speakers, like Omer Tene, an affiliate scholar at Stanford’s Center for Internet and Society, don’t seem ever to have received money from Google; rather, a department or organization they work for is funded in part by Google. On the CIS website, this is made plain: We are fortunate to enjoy the support of individual and organizational donors, including generous support from Google, Inc. Like all donors to CIS, Google has agreed to provide funds as unrestricted gifts, for which there is no contractual agreement and no promised products, results, or deliverables. To avoid any conflict of interest, CIS avoids litigation if it involves Google. CIS does not accept corporate funding for its network neutrality-related work. The CIS website also cites Microsoft as a funding source, along with the National Internet Alliance, a telecom lobbying group. “Neither Google nor any of the other supporters has influenced my work,” Tene told me, referring to his long bibliography on personal data and online privacy. But support at the institutional level may still influence individual behavior. Cooper, the George Mason staffer who reached out to Google for advice on a privacy conference in the screenshot above, works as the director of the program on economics and privacy at the university’s Law and Economics Center, which has received at least $750,000 from Google, as well as additional funds from Amazon, AT&T, and Chinese internet giant Tencent. A 2015 report in Salon detailed close ties between Google and Cooper, including emails indicating that Google was shopping an op-ed written by Cooper to newspapers, and other messages where Cooper asks Google for help crafting the content of a “symposium on dynamic competition and mergers”: Cooper also wrote pro-Google academic papers, including this one for the George Mason Law Review entitled “Privacy and Antitrust: Underpants Gnomes, the First Amendment, and Subjectivity,” where he argues that privacy should not be included in any antitrust analysis. Cooper does not disclose Google’s funding of the [Law and Economics Center] in the article. Other pro-Google articles by Cooper, like this one from Main Justice, do include disclosure. Cooper presented at this year’s PrivacyCon and did not disclose his relationship with Google. Cooper did not return a request for comment. Among the PrivacyCon presenters who have benefited from non-Google generosity: Carnegie Mellon University’s Alessandro Acquisti and Columbia University’s Roxana Geambasu received $60,000 and $215,000 in Microsoft money, respectively, on top of financial ties to Google. Both co-authored and presented papers on the topic of targeted advertising. Acquisti’s papers, which did not disclose his funding sources, concluded that such marketing was not necessarily to the detriment of users. Geambasu (to her credit) produced data that contradicted Google’s claims about how targeting works and disclosed her financial relationship with the company. She also noted to The Intercept that “all my funding sources are listed in my resume,” located on her website. The University of California, Berkeley’s International Computer Science Institute, which had an affiliated researcher presenting at PrivacyCon, counts on not just Google for its survival, but Microsoft, Comcast, Cisco, Intel, and Samsung. Two PrivacyCon submissions came out of Columbia’s Data Science Institute, which relies on Yahoo and Cisco. The Center for Democracy and Technology — which employs one PrivacyCon presenter and co-organized a privacy conference with Princeton in May — is made possible not just by Google but also an alphabet of startup and legacy tech money, according to IRS disclosures: Adobe, Airbnb, Amazon, AOL, Apple, all the way down to Twitter and Yahoo. Corporate gifts are often able to keep entire academic units functioning. The CMU CyLab, affiliated with four PrivacyCon presenters, is supported by Facebook, Symantec, and LG, among others. Narrower Disclosure Standards in Academia Contacted by The Intercept, academics who took money from tech companies and then spoke at PrivacyCon without disclosure provided responses ranging from flat denials to lengthy rationales. Some of the academics argued that just because their institution or organization keeps the lights on because of Silicon Valley money doesn’t mean they’re beholden to or even aware of these benefactors. But it’s harder to imagine, say, an environmental studies department getting away with floating in Exxon money, or a cancer researcher bankrolled by Phillip Morris. Like radon or noise pollution, invisible biases are something people both overstate and don’t take seriously enough — anyone with whom we disagree must be biased, and we’re loath to admit the possibility of our own. Serge Egelman, the director of usable security and privacy at Berkeley’s International Computer Science Institute, argued that this is hardly an issue unique to Google: I am a Google grant recipient, as are literally thousands of other researchers in computer science. Every year, like many other companies who have an interest in advancing basic research (e.g., Cisco, IBM, Comcast, Microsoft, Intel, etc.), Google posts grant solicitations. Grants are made as unrestricted gifts, meaning that Google has no control over how the money is used, and certainly cannot impose any restrictions over what is published or presented. These are grants made to institutions, and not individuals; this has no bearing on my personal income, but means that I can (partially) support a graduate student for a year. Corporate philanthropy is currently filling a gap created by dwindling government support for basic research (though only partially). He also added that no matter who’s paying the bills, his research is independent and strongly in the public interest: My own talk was on how Android apps gather sensitive data against users’ wishes, and the ways that the platform could be improved to better support users’ privacy preferences. All of my work in the privacy space is on protecting consumers’ privacy interests and this is the first time anyone has accused me of doing otherwise. The list of people who spoke at PrivacyCon are some of the most active researchers in the privacy space. They come from the top universities in computer science, which is why it’s no surprise that their institutions have received research funding from many different sources, Google included. The question that you should be asking is, was the research that was presented in the public interest? I think the answer is a resounding yes. Acquisti, the PrivacyCon presenter from CMU, is a professor affiliated with the university’s CyLab privacy think tank and shared a 2010 $400,000 Google gift with FTC technologist Cranor and fellow CMU professor Norman Sadeh before submitting and presenting two PrivacyCon papers sans disclosure, plus one presentation that included a disclosure. When the gift was given, the New York Times observed that “it is presumably in Google’s interest to promote the development of privacy-handling tools that forestall federal regulation.” Over email, Acquisti argued that disclosure is only necessary when it applies to the specific funding for a body of work being published or presented. That is, once you’ve given the talk or published a paper, your obligation to mention its financing source ends: “It would be highly misleading and incorrect for an author to list in the acknowledgements of an article a funding source that did NOT in fact fund the research activities conducted for and presented in that article.” In fact, Acquisti said, “It would be nearly fraudulent”: It would be like claiming that funds from a certain source were used to cover a study (e.g. pay for a lab experiment) while they were not; or it would be like claiming that a research proposal was submitted to (and approved by) some grant committee at some agency/institution, whereas in fact that institution never even knew or heard about that research. … This is such a basic tenet in academia. This line of reasoning came up again and again as I spoke to privacy-oriented researchers and academics — that papers actually should not mention funding directed to the researcher for other projects, even when such disclosure could bear on a conflict of interest, and that, for better or for worse, this deeply narrow standard of disclosure is just the way it is. And besides, it’s not as if researchers who enjoy cash from Google are necessarily handing favors back, right? According to Paul Ohm, a professor of law and director at Georgetown University’s Center on Privacy and Technology, that’s missing the point: The danger of corporate money isn’t just clear-cut corruption, but subconscious calculus among academics about their research topics and conclusions and invisible influence that funding might cause. Ohm said he continually worries about “the corrupting influence of corporate money in scholarship” among his peers. “I think privacy law is so poorly defined,” Ohm told The Intercept, “and we have so few clear rules for the road, that people who practice in privacy law rely on academics more than they do in most areas of the law, because of that it really has become a corporate strategy to interact with academics a lot.” It’s exactly this threat that a disclosure is meant to counter — not an admission of any wrongdoing but a warning that it’s possible the work in question was compromised in some way, however slight. A disclosure isn’t a stop sign so much as one suggesting caution. That’s why Ohm thinks it’s wise for PrivacyCon (and the infinite stream of other academic conferences) to err on the side of too much disclosure — he goes as far as to say organizers should consider donor source diversity in a “code of conduct.” “Let’s try to make sure we have at least one voice on every panel that didn’t take money,” Ohm said. “Are we getting voices that have never received money from a company like Google?” And ultimately, why not disclose? Egelman, from UC Berkeley’s International Computer Science Institute, told me he thought extra disclosures wouldn’t be a good way for “researchers [to] use valuable conference time.” Ohm disagrees: “I don’t think it’s difficult at the beginning of your talk to say, ‘I took funding in the broader research project of which this a part.’” In other words: Have you taken money from Google? Are you presenting to a room filled with regulators on a topic about which you cannot speak without the existence of Google at least looming overhead? It would serve your audience — and you — to spend 10 seconds on a disclosure. “Disclosure would have been great,” Ohm said of PrivacyCon. “Recent disclosure would have been great. Disclosure of related funding would have been great.” Apparently, only two other researchers agreed.

RSS ALL ARTICLES FEATURES ONLY   TRIVIA Search How-To Geek How to Hide (or Edit) Your Android Devices in Google Play’s Install List Google Play’s web interface is a really convenient way to install apps on your Android phone. Unfortunately, it holds on to all of your Android devices—even ones you no longer have. Here’s how to hide them from that installation menu. Basically, every new Android device you add to your Google account is included in Play’s installation menu on the web. Now, most people aren’t going to be adding new devices every week, but users who like to flash custom ROMs often will see some weird effects: the ROM causes the device to be registered as a new unit on the account. In other words, if you have a Nexus 6 that has been flashed 12-15 times, there’s a solid chance you’ll see that device listed on your account 12-15 times. It gets a little ridiculous. But even that aside, no one needs to see their old phones listed in the installation menu, because odds are you aren’t going to be installing something onto an old handset. The good news is that you can pretty easily control which devices show up in Play’s installation menu. To get started, you’ll need to go to the Google Play website from your web browser. It’s worth mentioning that while you can do this from your mobile device, it’s much easier from a computer. In the top right corner of Play’s web interface, you’ll see a handful of options: Google Apps, notifications, account, help, and settings. The last one—denoted by the cog icon—is what you want. Give it a click. Once clicked, a menu will open with two options: Settings and Android Device Manager. While the latter seems like the logical option, that’s not what we’re looking for here. Android Device Manager is Google’s device locator and has nothing to do with the setting you’re after. Instead, click “Settings.” This will open the “My Devices” menu, which is exactly what you want. This menu should show all of your devices, old and new, with several options for each. It’s broken down into categories to easier help you figure out what is what. If you’d like to rename any of your devices to something specific instead of the generic Make-Model-Carrier format, you can do so by clicking the “Edit” button on the right side and giving it a new name on the left. If you want to hide the device, however, simply untick the “Show in menus” option. That’s pretty much it. The changes will take a few minutes to show up in Play’s installation menu, but once they do, you’re done. Congratulations.

The thoughts and opinions expressed are those of the writer and not Gamasutra or its parent company.   This very long blog post is about developing for mobile, untethered VR and some design considerations and pitfalls to look out for when doing so, before moving onto performance optimisation, testing and Oculus Home store submission. But before getting into all that, let’s look at why you should. There are currently two main strands of VR development — tethered and untethered, or PC-based and mobile-based. PC-based, tethered VR utilises the powerful graphics cards within desktops to run high-end VR headsets such as the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive. Mobile, untethered VR utilises a user’s mobile phone device within a plastic, cardboard or foam VR headset, relying solely upon the processing power offered by that particular model, which will vary wildly from handset to handset. Mobile VR Considerations Mobile VR is currently the cheapest way for consumers and enthusiasts to get into Virtual Reality, with a range of mobile handsets supported and low cost headsets available. Whilst this comes with some issues (more on that later) current and future models of mobile handsets are powerful enough to render convincing VR experiences that are comfortable for most (at a solid 60Hz on Samsung Gear VR). Google Cardboard has shipped over 5m+ units whilst Samsung claim over 1m concurrent users are active within the Gear VR ecosystem at any given time. Headsets range from the cheap Google Cardboard v2 (often free at events) to plastic variations that are a bit more durable, or even foam versions like Merge VR, to Samsung Gear VR and a whole range of other mobile device connected options releasing soon. Whilst having range and options is good, to develop VR you ideally need a clear set of known hardware limitations and capabilities to ensure a solid, smooth, comfortable experience for end users. Therefore will concentrate on the current best of class options, Samsung Gear VR and the Google Daydream VR (releasing later in 2016 but you can start developing now, see my previous blog post about it here). Because of the low cost of entry for end users and consumers, the mobile VR market is rapidly growing with hundreds of new apps becoming available each month. 2016 has seen a real increase in general awareness of VR amongst consumers, buoyed by the launches of Oculus Rift and HTC Vive and imminent release of Sony PlayStation VR in October, along with VR appearing at many public facing events and shows. However being based on Android (although iOS does support Cardboard now and vice versa) it means it is easy to publish titles on the Play Store and already we are seeing lots of cheap, poorly designed VR applications that don’t provide great experiences. Therefore the Gear VR and Daydream marketplaces are (or will be when released) curated for quality control. Whilst this means there are additional barriers to publishing your apps, for end users it helps guarantee a level of quality of experience and overall, will boost VR adoption since comfortable experiences see users return, or what to continue to try others. So in the short term, slightly more of a headache for developers, but in the long term, better for everyone as VR is helped towards mass-market adoption. Limitations There are limitations to mobile VR though, which need to be considered before deciding upon which platform you’re going to support. Firstly, as the name suggests, mobile VR content is driven by mobile devices, not high-end powerful PCs. Whilst newer devices are certainly providing more processing power than ever before, there are still limits to how far and how complex a scene can be rendered in 3D (if you choose to go down that route). However that doesn’t mean it’s ineffective since a 3D generated scene doesn’t have to be photorealistic in order to be convincing or immersive for users. Low poly[gon count] worlds can be just as fun and effective within VR that are far easier to generate on mobile with great performance. Another aspect to consider is despite being untethered, allowing the user freedom of movement without being cabled to a PC, currently it’s not possible to track the position of the headset, meaning that no matter how far the user wanders, their viewpoint will only ever update in a 3 directions. This means that a lot of the full VR experiences they may have tried on tethered VR, where they can lean in and get up, close and personal with characters from any angle, or walk around within a room-scale area, are not possible with mobile VR. However there is hardware being worked on that will allow this eventually. So with less processing power available and no positional head tracking currently possible, it’s understandable why mobile VR excels at and is well supported for 360º photos and video applications. Without any form of real interaction though, if you are just looking around looking at or watching something, there is argument that this isn’t proper VR. Others would also state that with the advances being made with mobile VR and available processing power, developers should target full, high-end VR since the gap will only narrow and whatever you develop today for mobile VR will have a limited shelf-life, as the hardware advances rapidly over the next months and years. Setting Up Development Whilst it’s easier to publish apps on the Google Play Store for Android, and a great place to start if you are happy to release free content, I’ll mostly be focussing on developing for the curated content store offered by Oculus for the Samsung Gear VR, which will also be relevant for the Google Daydream VR ecosystem when it releases later this year. Development environment, SDKs and being an Oculus developer To make a 3D VR app, you need a 3D development environment that supports the necessary Software Development Kits (SDKs) for VR, in this case the Oculus Mobile SDK. The best 3D engine to use for this is Unity, which is available for free or via a paid subscription. The free option has some limitations and requirements of usage but the paid subscription now includes everything you need to publish mobile VR on Android devices (i.e. Samsung Gear VR and Google Daydream VR) and iOS (which doesn’t really have a strong VR footing yet although iPhone VR apps are now supported by Google Cardboard) rather than having to pay for them separately, as you did with older versions. Once you have Unity, you need to get the Oculus Mobile SDK for Unity and set yourself up as an Oculus developer. This is a simple registration to create an Oculus ID to log into the website with and start an area where you will eventually submit your app for review before publishing. The Mobile SDK has gone through a number of iterations and is now straight forward to work with, being very well documented. Alongside the Mobile SDK, you’ll also want to get the Audio SDK to make best use of the Oculus positional audio offerings that really add immersion for users to your VR apps. Similarly, this is now robust and well documented. Now you have the Oculus ID setup, you can also join the Oculus forums (and the Unity forums are great too) to find answers to any questions, queries or problems you run into and be part of the wider VR development community. Hardware So that’s the software side; to develop professionally and create great apps, you will need the hardware as well, so you can build, test and run your apps locally before submission to the store. If money isn’t an option, get as many of the supported Samsung mobile handsets you can afford, to test your app on to check performance across the range of devices. If money is tight, aim for the lowest common denominator device, the Samsung S6, to ensure that your app runs on at least the minimum specification mobile handset supported. Having the hardware for testing means you can take your app out on the road too before release and have users test it and give you feedback as well. Usability and user comfort are key elements of VR design and it_is_very_important to make sure your VR apps do not make users feel ill! But this is a subject for another blog post another day… Make sure your mobile device is set to both types of developer mode and allows installation of apps from unknown sources. You can do this by going to first Settings > About device > Build number and tapping Build number seven times to enable developer mode for Android. Then go to Settings > Application Manager, select Gear VR Service, then Manage Storage. Tap on VR Service Version a number of times until the Developer Mode toggle shows up. Slide it over to enable Oculus Gear VR Developer Mode. Finally, you want to enable your device to install and run apps from unknown sources, i.e. for when testing and you aren’t downloading from the Oculus or Google Play Stores. To do this, go to Settings > Security and check the option Unknown sources and OK the warning prompt. Now your mobile device is set to launch apps that are in development that you can side load onto it for testing and demoing. NB. If you can’t see Gear VR Service as an option, make sure you have put the device into a Gear VR headset previously to start the installation and setup process of the Oculus Gear VR software, drivers and home app — yes this means you need to buy one! One final element of hardware to software link is getting the OSIG of the Samsung mobile handset to insert into your test builds so that it runs on the Oculus Gear VR system without being a verified app. To do this you will first need to download a Device ID app from the Google Play Store, then run it to get that specific handsets Device ID. Once you have that, go to the Oculus OSIG generator website and enter the Device ID to get your unique OSIG file. Once downloaded, insert into your app package within Unity to allow the built apps to run on your device. That’s the software and the hardware, what to design and develop? Of course, not every app you develop has to be released or destined for public consumption so it’s a good idea, especially with VR, to create a series of prototypes and simple ideas first before committing to the full development effort of a polished experience app. Google spent some time making loads of interaction prototypes for Daydream VR that were simple and effective in helping developers understand the possibilities of what would be possible with the new hardware and input controller. If you’re starting out in VR dev, you will need to do this as well so you understand what does and importantly, doesn’t work in VR, then again to understand the current limitations of mobile VR. If your app performs poorly or is uncomfortable to use, it will not get past submission. Keep it simple Simple ideas and simple interactions work best for mobile VR because of the limited input options available. Yes, bluetooth Android controllers are available and supported by Samsung Gear VR, and the Google Daydream VR ecosystem states that a device must come with the controller to be compliant, but the majority of users presently do not own bluetooth gamepads. Therefore if you design an app (typically a game) that has only works with a bluetooth gamepad, rather than the built-in touchpad on the side of the headset, you will be dramatically reducing the potential market size of your buying audience. The touchpad on the side of the Gear VR (v1 retail edition) is bumpy to make it feel like a gamepad D-pad, so reduces the ease of diagonal swipes and interactions but makes it clearer for new VR users where to swipe forwards, backwards, up, down with a nubbin in the centre to mark a button tap area. The newly announced Gear VR 2, available to pre-order for release later in the year, has reverted back to the flat touchpad that the early Innovator Editions had. This is a good design decision since you can have more complex movements tracked from users fingers. The main downside of the touchpad on the side of the device is that new VR users tend to get headset grabby, holding the headset with their hands as they get used to the sensation of having their senses taken over by VR. This often results in user accidentally quitting or pausing the app, depending how it’s designed to operate, adding to the confusion and makes it tricky if demoing to people as unlike tethered full VR, you can’t see what they’re seeing without the app being mirrored to a display somewhere. Baring in mind most people who try your app could be new to VR, it could be the first VR experience they’ve ever tried, simple input makes it a lot easier for them to accept and adapt to the technology, which can be overwhelming for some in it’s own right. Thankfully as VR adoption is becoming more widespread and more and more people have access to VR, having to keep this fact in mind will reduce over time and hopefully next year, we won’t have to worry about it so much. Rock solid performance In order to pass submission and to make a comfortable experience for users, your app will have to run at a rock, solid 60 frames-per-second (fps) on the Samsung Gear VR. This is necessary as it has been deemed the lowest comfortable framerate for comfortable VR experiences by most users. Any frame drops, even for the briefest instant, can cause users to feel ill as the virtual world is stuttering and jittering, struggling to keep up with their head movements. This can be quite a challenge if you are unused to 3D engine optimisation or geometry simplification. You will only have about 50,000 polys (100,000 tops) to play with at any given frame within your VR scene, so you are going to have to be clever and think about the style and look overall and implement Unity tricks to get it looking the best whilst remaining stable. Thankfully the latest version of Unity 5.4 now supports single pass rendering so you can achieve the same result with less effort required by the hardware, with the VR elements being taken care of by the engine rather than drawing everything twice, albeit slightly different to encompass each eye viewpoint, to achieve the 3D depth effect necessary. Also thanks to John Carmack, original creator of DOOM, is now at Oculus and spends most of his time focused on mobile VR development and tools. As a result, Gear VR has long supported asynchronous timewarp, a technique employed by the SDK to smooth out frame drops and allow developers to get away with the occasional jitter on mobile hardware. But this does not mean you should use it as a crutch and think that you do not need to optimise your codebase! It has limitations and won’t always save you or your users. Oculus states the following targets to aim for, when it comes to limitations to bare in mind when developing for mobile VR with the Gear VR headset: 50–100 draw calls per frame 50,000–100,000 polygons per frame As fewer textures as possible (but they can be large) 1–3 ms in script execution Throttle the CPU and GPU effectively to control heat, battery usage and scene performance NB. All other Android APIs and SDKs (such as Google Cardboard) do not give you access usually to direct control over the CPU and GPU in the mobile device, this is something only Oculus does with specific Samsung devices through their partnership in creating the Gear VR and mobile SDKs. General Best Practice & Design Considerations Now it’s time to look at a series of useful tips and tricks centred around general best practice and VR design, to ensure you are providing a great VR experience for new and expert users alike. General Guidelines The VR marketplace is still fairly small, although it is now possible to sell upwards of 100,000 copies of a VR game app on the Oculus Gear VR store if popular. Don’t expect to become a millionaire overnight, this isn’t Angry Birds level of adoption, yet. The VR developer community is open and welcoming, friendly and helpful. If you get stuck, there are many forums for Unity, Oculus, Gear VR and Android, as well as VR community Slack channels to join. Find a local VR meetup in your area and attend to meet with other VR developers and discuss your findings or problems. Don’t be afraid of the Unity 5 VR tutorials, there are some great, simple and easy to understand examples of VR design from objects, understanding scale, performance, interaction types and pretty much everything else you need to understand of the basics of VR development. Similarly, the Oculus guidelines for VR design and usage of the mobile and audio SDKs are invaluable resources of information, tips and detailed code samples for great VR performance and optimisation. You will need all target hardware available for development and testing before app submission, or at the very least, the baseline minimum specification model, i.e. the Samsung Galaxy S6. (Technically some models of the Gear VR support the Samsung Note 4 mobile handset device but only advanced app developers should look to build and support this with their apps as it takes a lot of performance optimisation in order to maintain stable 60 frames per second in VR with this particular hardware chipsets.) VR Design Consider length of play time for new-to-VR users; design around keeping it to shorter play periods (15 min periods) and comfortable. Length of gameplay segments can also help users look after potential battery drain and overheating of their mobile device, allowing them to recharge and cool off if necessary without fear of losing progress in-game. If you’re going to make a horror title, clearly label it as so, especially when user testing, so that users can choose whether to continue with it or not. VR immersion feels very real and sudden surprises and shocks have a much more profound effect on users. A scale of interaction, offering initially simple controls allows newbies to enjoy the experience without being overwhelmed by figuring out what to do; they are already pretty overwhelmed by their first VR experience. Advanced or additional controls that can be unlocked later through design, progress within the experience allows a user to feel powerful and skilled as they master the finer controls. The scene should respond to user head movement at all times, even in menus and cut-scenes to ensure the user has a comfortable experience. Similarly, do not take control of the user’s viewpoint and move their head for them, this is incredibly uncomfortable to experience. Depending upon your app theme, avoid moving a user through the environment unless it is at a constant smooth velocity without acceleration or deceleration. If you have to move the user, place them in a cockpit of some description if possible to ground them and give them something in to foreground to focus on. Avoid changing user perspective. Do not pull the camera from first-person to third as the user will feel like the world has been dragged from beneath them. Allow users to adjust the comfort level if possible so that those prone to motion sickness can enable features designed to reduce discomfort, whereas more advanced users can disable them. Features that help reduce discomfort include: Stepped-turning of user avatar Look and teleport fade to a new location for movement Tunnelling to darken and fade out the peripheral visual data when turning User Interface Remember you are developing a stereoscopic app! Everything has to be rendered twice and to maintain immersion, should be embedded within the 3D world rather than floating over the top as would a traditional UI. If you have to use traditional UI then project onto a surface rather than directly onto the screen, so that it has a sense of depth within the environment. Typically, setting it to appear 1–3m from the user is considered most comfortable. Where possible, design UI into a logical, fitting 3D object within the world, i.e. onto a book, a scroll, a mobile phone or wrist display, so that the user is able to interact with it naturally. Design your UI layout so that it fits naturally within a comfortable viewing area of the user’s vision, so that they do not have to move their head around a great deal to see all the menu options or to navigate; they can move their head to select items but straining to see items to their far left or right causes neck strain. As mentioned previously, input is typically limited to the touchpad interactions as most owners will not have a bluetooth gamepad available with buttons to select menu items. Therefore you will have to consider alternative input mechanisms that utilise the nature of VR offered. Gaze interactions are commonplace with mobile VR apps, where a virtual cursor is shown that follows the movements of the user’s head position. When enabled, the user just has to look at a menu item to interact with it. Typically there will be a radial progress bar that will fill up after a period of time where the user remains focused on one item, that will then be selected. Whilst gaze interactions are easy to use, consider adding a tap to select override for advanced or impatient users since multi-layer UI menus can be tiresome and slow to navigate using gaze progress wait and fill option only. If your UI appears over the application running, make it clear to the user that they are in the menus and not in the world. Depending upon purpose, you may want to pause the action when showing a menu, or at the very least adjust the lighting and focus to be on the menu. Having a static icon in one corner that follows the user’s head movements provides a constant reminder they are in the menus if they were to look further to the left, right or behind them and lose sight of the panel. Even better, have the whole menu follow their head movements so they can never lose sight of it. Use the physical [BACK] button on the Gear VR headset to allow users to navigate back up a level if you have multi-layer menus, or even front-to-back swipes on the touchpad, although this can get confusing if you have a library menu design where they can scroll through a lot of content cells i.e. a photo or video catalogue. Performance Optimisation & Testing If you have already read to this point, where we have looked at considerations as to why you should design mobile VR apps for Samsung Gear VR (& to a degree prepare for Google Daydream VR), how to get your development environment setup and general VR design considerations, and you’re still here, then you must be pretty interested! Therefore it is assumed from this point onwards that you have at least a basic knowledge and understanding of 3D asset creation and app development, since I’m switching to a more specific set of technical terminology in order to relate to key aspects of design and development appropriately. You have been warned… Performance Optimisation Optimising the performance of your mobile VR app is key, since it ensures that the user has a comfortable experience (horror titles aside) and it passes the submission review as part of the curated store process. There are a couple of areas to performance; overall app performance, 3D optimisation and battery lifetime. These all play a part to ensure that users can enjoy your app for as long as possible, give great reviews and tell their friends and associates about it to help spread the word. Optimise for 60 frames per second. You can not drop a frame, although Asynchronous TimeWarp will hide and smooth some more complex scenes but do not rely upon it. Don’t rely on the frame rate counter in the Unity editor since it is doing everything twice when you play a scene on your computer. Whilst it can give you a good indication of where your performance levels are at, build out and test on the target hardware to ensure smooth experiences. Users often can’t tell beyond around a virtual distance of 20m whether the image or scene they are looking at is stereoscopic or monoscopic. Use this to your advantage to swap out skyboxes for far off environments to save rendering load on a mobile device. Use the tools built into Unity to help you: The Profiler and Frame Debugger. These will show you were your app is lagging or overloading a scene, allowing you to go through frame by frame to examine how the scene is constructed by stepping through the draw calls. You will likely find objects you don’t need to render, reducing your overall draw call amount. Furthermore, batch your draw calls wherever possible using the UnityStatic Batching and Dynamic Batching tools built into the editor. Cull the faces from your 3D models geometry that will never be seen to remove wasteful polys. Similarly, use occlusion culling to ensure you are not rendering things that cannot be seen yet, i.e. the geometry of a room beyond a door that hasn’t been opened yet. Simplify your 3D meshes as much as possible to ensure you have the lowest level of detail for objects without losing finer information. Reduce overdraw as much as possible to ensure fewer objects are drawn over the top of one another. The Unity Scene View Control Bar will give you a understanding of what can be optimised. Whilst there, use lightmapping to bake your shadows onto objects and scenes rather than using expensive dynamic shadows. Beyond skyboxes, if you have to render an object in 3D in the distance then use lower levels of detail (LOD) in your model with fewer triangles and swap out to higher LOD models as they get closer to the users viewpoint. Make sure CPU and GPU throttling is enabled since failing to initialise these values will result in your app running in a downwards clocked environment by default. Gear VR apps are typically CPU bound so favouring this over the GPU will often get the best performance. However if your app is optimised well, you might be able to downclock both the CPU and GPU increasing battery life and therefore session playtime. Testing The key to a great app is to test regularly and iterate upon after each session, including relevant suggestions and improvements to user flow, interface, process and design as you go, rather than storing all the effort up until the last minute when you think it is 100% done. This way, you will be able to make continuous small adjustments that will overall require less effort than suddenly discovering a major flaw in your design not apparent to you until too late, requiring a huge amount of effort to rework and fix. As a developer you will be too close and involved with the app to see the issues and bugs, so user testing early on and throughout the development process is critical to ensure you aren’t missing something obvious that a first-time user can spot straight away. However there are still a number of tests that you can and should carry out yourself before unleashing it upon others. The main types of testing you will be carrying out are functionality and performance related, to ensure that it operates as it should do, at a basic level, in a means that will make for comfortable usage by users. You could write unit tests for aspects of functionality but sometimes you’re just going to have to carry out manual testing and spot any issues yourself. If you have decided to manage the development process using Agile methodology, then you can create a series of test cases from your epics and user stories to ensure that the app functions and includes the features as intended. Otherwise you will need to think of a series of test cases that effectively test and capture all possible conditions and uses, not just for the expected behaviour and user journey but also what a user could do to disrupt this and potentially end up in a locked state, i.e. not accepting a checkbox or not meeting the score to progress to the next level without an option to try again. Testing VR for functionality is harder than testing a normal flat app since you are best running it on the device in the VR headset, but this means you cannot quickly switch over to a spreadsheet or notepad to detail issues you spot. So testing in pairs is recommended so one can interact and carry out the tests whilst the other is annotating issues verbally described. Before you get to this stage though, you can run the app directly in the Unity Editor to check functionality and performance without having to make a build and deploy to a mobile device. As referenced above in the performance optimisation section, the Unity Profiler, Frame Debugger and Scene Viewer will provide a good starting point to test for performance, as well as in the Editor itself throwing up any edge case exceptions and code errors. User Testing User testing requires more preparation and time to get right to ensure you are getting valid feedback about your app and not the technology. As mentioned in an earlier blog post, roughly 9 out of 10 people still haven’t tried VR before and so, using them as fresh test subjects, whilst necessary, needs management to make them useful to you. When arranging a user testing session, have each tester carry out a period of VR familiarisation and acclimatisation before asking them to try out and test your app. If they are new to VR, then this will give them a chance to be wowed by the technology and the experience of being immersed in another world without that excitement affecting the usefulness of their feedback specifically about your VR app. Once they are aware of what VR can do and how it works at a basic level, they will be ready to test your app with a clearer understanding of how it should work, feel and sensations provided. Some good examples of familiarisation apps on Gear VR are the Samsung Introduction to Virtual Reality (free) and Welcome to Virtual Reality by SliceVR (paid). Prepare a set of questions to ask them after their test session with your app to gather useful feedback and information about how they felt, how easy they understood what to do, where they struggled or got stuck, or aspects that made them feel uncomfortable (from a performance perspective not a content, scary horror angle). Remember, it’s harder to mirror the content shown on a mobile VR device and so you likely won’t be able to see in real time what they are looking at (and likely pointing at in thin air). Have a set of printouts with you with key screens and menus on from your app so after their test session, they can refer to them and help them describe certain screens or panels that they’ve seen and are highlighting but may not necessarily know or use the same names as you do for them. If you have the budget available, there are companies now offering VR testing services to take some of the time effort and strain off you. Testronic Labs now offer a paired VR testing service for functionality and compatibility, whereas Player Research are leaders in user research and user testing, both creating and providing comprehensive reports post-test for you to take on-board as part of the service. So by now, your app should be running smoothly at a solid 60 frames and is bug free (as ever a piece of software can be), has been tested and verified comfortable and easy-to-use by a range of intended end users. Therefore it’s time to submit your app to the Oculus Store and get ready for launch! Store Submission Store Submission Process In order to be able to sell your app on the Oculus Store for Gear VR titles, you will need to have the app reviewed by the Oculus Store team for comfort, performance and general suitability before they will give the green light for it to be released. This is a relatively straight-forward process but does require a bit of legwork on your behalf to get everything setup in the backend first. The amount of effort required to setup your app depends upon the features included with your app i.e. whether or not you have IAP, matchmaking for multiplayer, achievements, leaderboards and so on. Many elements you will have to setup APIs and IDs for in the backend, then go back into your app project in Unity to ensure that the appropriate values are used for each achievement unlock, IAP etc. You should have already setup an Oculus ID, as covered in part 2 of this blog series, but if not, it’s quick to do over on oculus.com. Under ‘Developers > Dashboard’ you’ll need to ‘Create new organisation’ before you can create an app profile. Ensure that all the important information is correct for your organisation, such as address, financial banking information so that you can receive hardware but crucially, monthly revenue payments for your app once it’s on sale. Basics Once you have setup your organisation you can then setup your app, by going to ‘My Apps > Create New App’ and start to enter the information. IMPORTANT! Currently, there is no way to delete an app entry as a whole once you have created it so ensure all details are correct at time of creation — you can go back and edit app information at any time but if you like a clean dashboard like me, get it right first time! The first stage is to select the platform — we’re submitting a mobile VR app so select ‘Gear VR’ and enter the full app name to create the initial entry. Once you have the initial app profile created with name and platform, Oculus will generate you a unique app ID which you will need to use within your Unity project to initialise any Oculus APIs, especially those that relate to IAP or licence ownership checks for the final version. Similarly, once you have setup financial information, you can then create any IAP tokens and IDs to then call from the Unity project for each appropriate action via ‘Edit Details > Platform > IAP’. App Store Info The main information that will appear on the Oculus Store for your app is under ‘Edit Details > Submission Info’. Here you will enter the full and short description, set the genre, features, peripherals supported, any age ratings and price. Some of these elements are up to you, some like age rating might need an external body to review, or as with price, the Oculus Store team to work with you to agree on a value that is deemed appropriate. Be aware that all apps are set to ‘Free’ by default so if you want to charge for it, be sure to change this before submission! One time consuming element, as with any store submission, is the art assets you need to create and provide to go along with the listing. There are a few different shapes and sizes of images required, depending upon where and how the listing will be displayed within the store but the guidelines are easy to follow with advice of where to place the logo, or not, to ensure dynamic banners for sales etc don’t cover it when enabled. One cool asset that you can provide for Gear VR titles (that isn’t yet supported for Rift titles) is a cube map image, so potential customers can view a still from your title in 360º on their Gear VR whilst in the store listing. Builds Of course, information is all very well but you need to upload a build to be reviewed and ultimately, available for download post-purchase. It is wise to run the Oculus Submission Validator tool against your app APK file before you submit and ensure you have done the following: Set the XML manifest file and install location correctly — Gear VR apps have to be set to install on the device not external storage. A version code set — typically if this is your first submission, 1.0 or incremented if uploading a new build post-review from a previous submission A signed APK so that once reviewed and confirmed ready for release, it can go live without further uploads necessary. The build management section allows you to upload builds to a variety of different channels: Alpha, Beta, Release Candidate and Live. Note that a number of journalists have access to the Release Candidate channel and so, if you haven’t done any PR or marketing around your app before launch, be prepared for them to potentially stumble across it and release a preview article without warning. So it’s best to reach out before setting a build to this channel, so that you can preempt any issues if it’s not 100% ready for release yet! Ready to Submit Once you think you have everything entered, you can submit the information via ‘Submission Info > Submit’ where a handy checklist is shown with current status of each section needed. Once you have a nice row of green ticks, you have a final chance to review the full listing and details below before clicking that [SUBMIT FOR REVIEW] button.

The code has been updated to fix this. If you are using an existing version of Templated Export and would like to upgrade keeping your existing settings please follow the instructions in this document (comments are open if any step is unclear). Templated Export allows users to reshape and selectively publish data from Google Spreadsheets in custom formats. The tool is powered by Google App Script which allows integration with Google Spreadsheets using existing authenticated access. Example uses include: turning data from a spreadsheet into a RSS feed and publishing data from a spreadsheet in JSON format to be used by other tools/services. The framework for creating a custom wrapper for your data means there are many more opportunities. Main features Cloud based Selective publication of data (down to individual cells) Publication of data in different file types (text, atom, rss, xml, json) Complete customisation of output file structure Setup Open Templated Export for Google Spreadsheets File > Make a copy of the script File > Manage Versions and enter a description and Save New Version Run > onInstall twice (first time to authorise, second to fun the function) Publish > Deploy as web app… and click Update and open the ‘Current web app URL’ or click on the ‘latest code’ link if available. Bookmark this link (there are many tutorials for turning chrome bookmarks into applications) Example usage Generating a custom RSS Feed of data from a Google Spreadsheet Publishing data from other sources like Guardian Datastore Selectively publishing cell ranges as JSON Some example templates If you download this JSON file it contains the templates used in the demonstrations above. Use the Local Template: Backup/Restore button in Templated Export to install them. Comments/suggestions welcome I make the usual warranties that I’m not a professional programmer and I’m already aware of some niggly bugs, but comments and suggestions are always welcome. If there is enough interest in this tool I’m happy to put it on a community coding site or donate it to someone who actually knows what they are doing ;) Share this: Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window) Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window) Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) Related Posted in Featured, Google, Google Apps Script, Google Sheets, Templated Export 66 Comments Templated Export for Google Spreadsheets using Google Apps Script | Google Apps Script | Scoop.it 4 years ago Permalink Joris Steurs 4 years ago Permalink Very interesting! Does this approach allows you to push the submissions from my google form to my local Excel sheet?Reply Mark Allen 4 years ago Permalink Martin, Having a bit of trouble getting off the ground with this. I’ve tried on a couple of GApps domains, have flushed out any previous instance of the script and retried, but each time I get to run the script the second time and see this message “ReferenceError: “DOCNAME” is not defined. (line 54)” Is it something simple/idiotic? Please don’t spend more than 10 seconds on this – I’m sure I’ll figure it out eventually…Reply nheilmann 4 years ago Permalink Hey Martin, Thanks for taking us step by step through the setup. Sadly, I’ve run into the same problem as Mark above. Any help would be much appreciated.Reply nheilmann 4 years ago Permalink OK got it to work but my resulting feed won’t validate: https://script.google.com/a/macros/isp.cz/s/AKfycbzMUGHawJaTS6_7bOhDjYuWD-UWJrO1pN1nh7dPVOpTdK0pHWW9/exec?template=S12767461300u12768614302&download=true http://validator.w3.org says “It looks like this is a web page, not a feed.” When I put the link URL into the browser it looks like an RSS feed should but the validator shows something completely different. This feed doesn’t work with any reader I have either. This is a bummer because I think this could be a really great tool with tons of uses.Reply Martin Hawksey 4 years ago Permalink Hi – I tried your link but the response was it did not exist. One other thing I noticed was the url you used was an export url which forces html download. Try using the publish url instead which should validate as xml If it’s still not working get mack in touch MartinReply Jacob 4 years ago Permalink Hi, I believe the problem nheilmann was having (and the problem I’m having now) is related to authentication. My employer uses Google Apps for Education, and no matter what I do I can’t seem to prevent the feed URL from redirecting to web login via Shib. This is why we are seeing a nice valid feed in the browser (already authenticated) but feed readers and validators just get redirected – not very useful behavior for a feed. I’ve tried changing the access settings in both the script and the spreadsheet, making everything as public as possible, but to no avail. Any ideas?Reply Ian Weatherhogg 4 years ago Permalink I’ve just tried for the first time, from scratch, and I got it working without needing login, from incognito window in Chrome and using private browsing in Firefox, so Jacob you must have done something wrong. However the feed doesn’t use content-type text/xml, perhaps because Google have added more layers of security and redirection? I can get my feed working in Google Reader.Reply Joe 4 years ago Permalink I am following the setup directions exactly and get to the 2d run onintall on step 4 and get this error: ReferenceError: “TemplatedExport” is not defined. (line 43) This seems to be perfect for my needs, too bad I can’t get past this error. This must just be for developers and not day to day users I guess.Reply Martin Hawksey 4 years ago Permalink Sounds like the managed library isn’t registering properly. In the script editor when you open Resource > Managed Libraries … does it include TemplatedExport ?Reply Joe 4 years ago Permalink ah, okay, I see what I did wrong, the first time I copy/pasted the code, I reread the instructions to Make a copy and it looks like ti’s there. But I get the same error as user below about docnameReply Sam 4 years ago Permalink Hey there, I am also having a problem with the DOCNAME not being defined. Is there a solution for this? Great & useful script though (from what I can see).Reply JAM 4 years ago Permalink It appears the issue is that DOCNAME and TEMPLATENAME are meant to be strings that the user selects. For example, changing these to “mydocname” and “mytemplatename” (each in quotes) should get the app to run.Reply Comment spammer Twitter 4 years ago Permalink jack lail 4 years ago Permalink Very nice tool. Thanks for doing the vids and blog post. I had a couple false starts, but i got it working! — jack lailReply Sam 4 years ago Permalink Can you explain how the “TemplatedExport” object works and where is it defined ? Are you hiding it ? if So how did you do ?Reply Martin Hawksey 4 years ago Permalink It’s a managed library I wrote https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guide_libraries (using the script debugger you can set a breakpoint and step into the code. The code should be linked to in the post somewhere)Reply Sam 4 years ago Permalink Yes I’ve managed to figure out it was a managed library. Really cool stuff this Google App Script. And thanks for your quick answer. Your Doing amazing work here !Reply Trevor Cunningham (@chalkjockey) 4 years ago Permalink Great script, exactly the type of thing I’m looking for. I’m trying to generate an RSS feed from a Google Spreadsheet to load into Tagxedo to make a word cloud. Google seems to have discontinued the publish as RSS feature and this script fits the bill perfectly. I had a few snags along the way. The first repeats the most consistent error (DOCNAME) mentioned above. Changing to MYDOCNAME fixed that. It’s really easy to set up, and if you understand html, the template is a breeze. But I am now stuck on the feed validating. I’ve made the spreadsheet public, and that doesn’t make a difference. The publish URL function seems to default to Private…can’t get Published to stick…is this an issue? Bottom line, I’ve got a feed ready to go, but need to know what to do in order for a reader to take it. https://script.google.com/a/macros/aisr.org/s/AKfycby2FRvkCU0Yy48-altmopXO0-itCjOXLypAijDGGMsx5yafG4z_/exec?template=S13608932225u13609060141&download=falseReply Martin Hawksey 4 years ago Permalink Hi Trevor, I tried accessing the link and it wasn’t found. When you published as a service (Tools > Script Editor then think publish menu) did you allow anyone to access even anonymously? Some apps domain configuration prevent publication outside of the orgReply Trevor Cunningham (@chalkjockey) 3 years ago Permalink Well, I’m back at it again and keep running into the same problem. I am using an organizational Google domain, but everything I’m doing is in house. No matter the combination, the published URL will not be recognized as a feed. Here’s the most current effort: https://script.google.com/a/macros/aisr.org/s/AKfycbw6YAOG7VLzTwJdpJezpjyuApZxFPm9u_bmu6sVtc4a1OA0zq8l/exec?template=S316206015830u316186598647&download=false No idea why this isn’t working.Reply Dar 3 years ago Permalink Hi Martin, I’ve watched your videos and read the documentation – this looks ideal for what I want to do and thanks for taking the time to write it all up. However, I cannot get past the same issue that many above have raised: ReferenceError: “MYDOCNAME” is not defined. (line 54, file “Code”) Even if I change the MYDOCNAME to something else the error persists. Could you please address this issue? You’ve taken great care to walk us through the other steps that it’s a shame something so trivial is prevent us from getting past this. Many thanks, Dar.Reply Martin Hawksey 3 years ago Permalink Hi Dar, Finally fixed this bug. If you take a fresh copy of the template and follow the instructions it should work MartinReply Dar 3 years ago Permalink Hello again Martin, That’s fantastic, thank you so much for doing that. I’m up and running now. I’m carefully examining your mashActivityRSS file in your video now to see what I have to customise for my own spreadsheet. It’s looking very promising though. Cheers, Dar.Reply Dar 3 years ago Permalink Hello Martin, I think I’m 99% there but there appears to be an issue with my feed. Here it is: https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycbzX9FOtXLjTH5_ZFPMPaSRDwDmGPJAJ2SkTYgRN_eVjtfbfy7yf/exec?template=S14069818285u14068754955&download=false The problem, I think, is the Content-Type, it should be application/xml, but I’m currently returning text/html. As such, my feed is not being processed by my reader. Is there somewhere I can modify this? Feel free at any time to tell me to go work this out for myself! Thanks, Dar.Reply Martin Hawksey 3 years ago Permalink Hi Dar, What reader are you using?Reply Dar 3 years ago Permalink Hi Martin, FYI, here is a screenshot of my template: http://tinypic.com/view.php?pic=30bcpbq&s=5 I’ve tried using both Google Reader and Feedly – both just return an empty page. (Ultimately I’ll be sending this feed to the Terminal Four CMS, but these Readers are a quick way to check that its working.) Also, I notice on my mac that Chrome (v27) shows the file OK, but Firefox (v21) just shows the empty page. Someone told me the issue was to do with the content-type and that it should be application/xml. I’ve tried toggling between XML & RSS in your template, but no joy. I feel like I’m so close! Dar.Reply Martin Hawksey 3 years ago Permalink Hi – Looks like the feed you’re generating isn’t valid http://validator.w3.org/feed/check.cgi?url=https%3A%2F%2Fscript.google.com%2Fmacros%2Fs%2FAKfycbzX9FOtXLjTH5_ZFPMPaSRDwDmGPJAJ2SkTYgRN_eVjtfbfy7yf%2Fexec%3Ftemplate%3DS14069818285u14068754955%26download%3Dfalse which might be why it’s not renderingReply Greg Lam 3 years ago Permalink First off, fantastic tool! I looked for several way to export my google spreadsheet to XML or JSON and yours was the best I came across. One of the problems I needed to overcome was to customize how the spreadsheet data was formatted, and the templates, with the prefix, row template, row separator, and suffix were exactly the control I needed. My only small issue I had was with using the Load/Save Template. No matter what I do, I can’t seem to load a template. I tried downloading your template and restoring it. I can see the templates in the drop-down, but selecting them doesn’t load a template. I tried saving my own templates, and there’s data in the .JSON template file if I download it, but again, when I restore the data and try to Load it by selecting it from the drop-down, nothing happens. Any ideas?Reply Martin Hawksey 3 years ago Permalink Hi – do any messages display when you try and load a template?Reply Greg Lam 3 years ago Permalink No, the Preview window just says “Idling”, as seen in this screenshot http://note.io/1ajsso5.Reply Greg Lam 3 years ago Permalink Interesting thing, is that I used another Google account that I have to access the published app. The other Google account was indeed able to load the templates.Reply Martin Hawksey 3 years ago Permalink There are sometimes domain restrictions on Google Apps accounts. Is this possible in your scenario or is the main account another Google account?Reply Greg Lam 3 years ago Permalink I’m unsure. My Google accounts are the free ones, not a paid business Google App account. The 1st Google account which I used to deploy the app cannot load the templates, but the 2nd Google account that I have, which is in no way connected to the 1st account, can load the template. What I also tested, was to use that 2nd Google account to deploy the app. The Load/Save Template feature does work as it should, so there must be some issue with my 1st Google account.Reply Greg Lam 3 years ago Permalink Sorry, it feels like I’m spamming your comment section, but I have isolated the issue. It seems to be related to the browser. It works on Safari, but not on Chrome. So it’s either an issue with Chrome itself or with my settings. The reason I had thought it was related to my Google accounts was because I use a different browser for each account. In any case, my chrome is the most up-to-date. I tried adjusting settings, but couldn’t seem to do anything to make it work, but at least I now know it’s a browser issue. Thanks for all your help in this! Martin Hawksey 3 years ago Permalink Hi Greg – not at all your feedback is very useful. Odd it’s not working in Chrome. The script uses a watered down version of GWT so usually it’s fairly bullet proof. I don’t have a mac so hard for me to chase. The interface may be in the need of a overhaul as the script services it uses appear to be at risk. Steve Magoulas 3 years ago Permalink Excellent information and what a great tool! Thanks so much Martin for making that public. In just 10 minutes I managed to publish my first (totaly customized) RSS feed. I have only one question, and that is about caching. My source of data is updated frequently and I want to get these updates almost in real time. I heard that Google Docs caches results for about 2 hours, but one can bypass that adding to the request a random string like …?time=RandomString. Could I apply this technique using Templated Export or not? Thanks again for making this great script. It can have so many uses.Reply Philippe Reaud 3 years ago Permalink Hi Martin and Thank You very much to have sharing this… Very very very usefull for me. Thank You again !Reply Simon Thompson 2 years ago Permalink Thank you so much Martin – this has saved hours of work and opened up some interesting possibilities. Making sure all the permissions are granted seems to be the key to easy use so the first video was very useful.Reply James 2 years ago Permalink I need to output a literal curly brace immediately next to a cell value, but this results in an error. e.g. I need {{{cell[‘name’]}}} -> {thisName} Is it possible to escape the leading brackets or something?Reply Stev 2 years ago Permalink Thank you very much for the brilliant work. I have successfully created a rss feed that can be used by feed readers. Upon importing the published url all the feeds populate the reader as expected. My problem is that the feed does not update and generate new feeds with the spreadsheet even if the spreadsheet is left open. I have tested this with several readers. Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.Reply Huy Tran Quang 2 years ago Permalink Hi Martin. Many thanks to your great tool. It’s been my best co-worker for 2 years. Buy sadly Google has disabled the ScriptDB since last month. Do you have plan to migrate our belove tool to other technique to keep it alive ? RegardReply Martin Hawksey 2 years ago Permalink ahh forgot about this project using ScriptDb. I had no idea anyone was using it. I’ll see if there is a quick fix. In the meantime I recommend exporting you templatesReply Andi Northrop 2 years ago Permalink Just ran into the same problem, having only just discovered this great tool. I was hoping to publish spreadsheet updates as an RSS – do you know of any other methods to achieve the same result, or any clues as to how you were doing it? Many thanks, hope you manage to find an easy fix!Reply Huy Tran Quang 2 years ago Permalink Could we just have a quick fix by using the manual method: save and load template from local/gdrive file ? I think it’s even better since now we know where our precious templates are stored. 1 day without the tool make our life so hard, Martin ;((Reply Huy Tran Quang 2 years ago Permalink Just update following your instruction and the tool works well again. I got “something went wrong” when try to restore the backup file and some old templates are missing. But that’s still okey. Thanks so much, Martin.Reply Martin Hawksey 2 years ago Permalink One of the services originally used in this project has been deprecated by Google. The code has been updated to fix this. If you are using an existing version of Templated Export and would like to upgrade keeping your existing settings please follow the instructions in this document (comments are open if any step is unclear).Reply Paul 2 years ago Permalink Hi Martin, Thank you for the awesome tool! I’ve been using it to create KML files. It was working on Jan 18th, but I tried it today and I get the following error: ReferenceError: “ScriptDb” is not defined. (line 43, file “Code”) Is there anything I can do to get it working?Reply Martin Hawksey 2 years ago Permalink ScriptDb looks like it’s completely toast now. In the Script Editor comment out (by adding // at the start of the line so that it becomes //TemplatedExport.setDb(ScriptDb.getMyDb());) should fix it. If you didn’t export your templates I’m afraid you might have to redo them.Reply Eduard 2 years ago Permalink Hi Martin! Thank you very much for the great work. I’m trying to install for the first time the Templated Export but I also get the error [ReferenceError: “ScriptDb” is not defined] You say the code has been fixed to solve this issue, but the code I’m getting when I follow the link in your setup instructions looks to still have the issue. Is there an updated version? Thanks!Reply Martin Hawksey 2 years ago Permalink Ah looks like Google have completely removed ScriptDb now. You can fix by commenting out line 43 (by adding // at the start of the line) so that it becomes //TemplatedExport.setDb(ScriptDb.getMyDb()); or take a fresh copy of the script. Thanks – MartinReply Samuel 2 years ago Permalink Hi Martin, commenting of the row //TemplatedExport.setDb(ScriptDb.getMyDb()); doesn’t help. Still have the same error as other guys: ReferenceError: “ScriptDb” is not defined….Reply Martin Hawksey 2 years ago Permalink Hi – try deleting it (apps script reads commented out code)Reply Zubair 2 years ago Permalink Excellent tool.. Thanks a lot Only one question, for whatever I am using this for it doesn’t recoginize the published link since it doesn’t have the file extension .XML please suggest a fix. ThanksReply Martin Hawksey 2 years ago Permalink published urls don’t need extensions and the content type is included in the header information (the server requesting the url is told what the content type is). If exporting a file for download the correct extension is addedReply Simeon 1 year ago Permalink Hi Martin, I was looking for a tool to create a XML file with a specific structure from a Google Spreadsheet, I think your tool could be the perfect bet for this. Unfortunarely when I try to run the script, I get this message: “Your one shot authorisation state is not valid. The scripts must be reauthorised. The script’s reauthorisation can be triggered by calling ScriptApp.invalidateAuth() and rerunning the script.” I followed your instructions but it seems I’m missing something. ThanksReply Tomas 1 year ago Permalink Hello, I have the same problem. ThanksReply dave 1 year ago Permalink Fantastic and interesting article. I used the code to convert a google spreadsheet into an XML file. Like others, I found a bit of a learning curve, but reading through the comments helped me to debug. Thanks for the time you are taking to answer peoples questions and for the original share. FYI: I am using a google spreadsheet to manage (create, prioritize and visulize) windows 8 custom speech vocabularies and am using your script to export the custom WSR voice commands file. The spreadsheet allows me to consider how I am growing my computers vocabulary to increase recognition. Cheers!Reply Hazael Diaz 10 months ago Permalink Hello Martin thanks for sharing this! really. I’m getting the same error as Simeon and Thomas seems like there is a problem with the authorisation: svc.enable(svc.Restriction.ALL); Method Service.enable is deprecated.Collapse File: Code Line: 63 The method has been marked as deprecated which means that the feature should be avoided and may be removed in the future. Consider using an alternative solution. Any help on this will be much appreciated. ThanksReply Hazael Diaz 10 months ago Permalink Sorry, working now.. I just had to deauthorize ScriptApp.invalidateAuth(); and authorize again.. and now everything working fine.Reply Chris Kelly 6 months ago Permalink I’m running into the same issue you guys had… where did you put that snippet of code to make it work? I’ve tried everything I can think of, and I can get it to re-auth, but the same error keeps popping up. Thanks!Reply Tobia Donati 5 months ago Permalink I’m in the same situation, I tried to insert ScriptApp.invalidateAuth(); in line 63 and comment the other function and I was able to deauthorize an authorize again the app but it still not working. Is anyone still able to use this script?Reply Cameron 4 months ago Permalink Same. Martin Hawksey 4 months ago Permalink … this is a project I sorely need to revisit particularly with Google introducing Add-ons for Sheets Tim 2 months ago Permalink I for one would love to see this updated. Being able to publish sheets as RSS is such an obvious need! Tried to get this going and have tons of trouble getting a valid public feed.

SUBSCRIBE Is Google showing fewer image boxes in its search results? You are now 50% less likely to see the image box show up in your Google search results page. Is it a bug or a feature? Barry Schwartz on September 15, 2016 at 12:46 pm More Google would show an image box for typically anywhere from 35 percent to 20 percent of the queries they return — at least this is based on tracking tools from Moz and RankRanger — but that seems to have dropped significantly yesterday by half. Both Moz and RankRanger are showing about a 50-percent reduction in the frequency Google will show the image box in the web search results. The box looks like this on desktop web search results: Now, those boxes show up not as often, according to these tools. We did ask Google for a comment but have not yet heard back. We will update this story if we hear anything from them. Here is the chart from Mozcast showing the reduction from about 30 percent to about 15 percent, a 50-percent drop: Here is the RankRanger chart showing a drop from about 23 percent to 11 percent: Anecdotally, I am also seeing webmasters confirm this. So it doesn’t seem to be a bug with the tools that track Google. It might be a bug with Google or Google may have decided to show the image box less often. Again, we are waiting to hear back from Google on this. About The Author Barry Schwartz Barry Schwartz is Search Engine Land's News Editor and owns RustyBrick, a NY based web consulting firm.

(AMZN) or Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Better value doesn’t necessarily mean better stock By Will Ashworth, InvestorPlace Contributor  |  Sep 15, 2016, 1:36 pm EST     Popular Posts: 7 S&P 500 Stocks That Will Be Knocked Back Down to Earth 3 Reasons Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Still Is a Great Buy 7 Stocks to Buy That Will Grow by Double Digits Recent Posts: Whole Foods Market, Inc. (WFM) Stock Has Only One Chance At Survival 3 Reasons Why Netflix, Inc. (NFLX) Stock Is Worth Its Insane Valuation 3 Reasons Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Still Is a Great Buy View All Posts Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is beating Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG) when it comes to stock performance, up 14.1% year-to-date through September 13 compared to 2.7% for Google’s parent. Source: Mike Seyfang via Flickr The same story plays out over one-year, three-year, five-year and 10-year periods. AMZN stock’s always been the better play. However, as they say in the mutual fund business, past performance doesn’t guarantee future results. If ever there was a time for reversion to the mean to rear its ugly little head it would seem perfectly reasonable to assume that the Amazon/Google performance disparity that’s been demonstrated over the past decade would make for the ideal flip flop. So GOOGL Stock Wins? From a value perspective it seems logical that if Google’s stock’s been pummeled by Amazon for more than a decade, that GOOGL should be the better buy — shouldn’t it? Well, not exactly. 7 Stock Splits Investors Are Dying to See First, one has to consider how they define “value.” Is it price-to-earnings, sales, cash flow, buttons, or some other valuation exercise that speaks to the analytical side of your brain? Is value the price paid today or the price received tomorrow? It’s all in the eye of the beholder. Let’s take a quick look at each company’s current valuation. The Valuation Case — P/E Google’s trailing-12-month P/E ratio (TTM) is 30.6 and its forward P/E ratio is 19.6. Meanwhile, Amazon’s TTM P/E ratio is 189.3 and its forward P/E ratio is a more palatable 49.3, almost three times greater. From this single view, GOOGL stock is absolutely a better value than AMZN. After all, would you pay $50 for a steak at one restaurant when you can get exactly the same quality product at another restaurant that costs $30 less? I don’t think so. The problem with using earnings is they can sometimes provide unreliable comparisons because of timing issues such as different quarter-ends, etc. A much less problematic way to examine the value proposition is through sales. Sure, quarters not aligning can still be a problem but not nearly as much. The Value Case — P/S In Google’s case, its stock trades at 6.7 times sales or about twice AMZN’s multiple of 3. From this perspective, at least, AMZN is the better value. More importantly, research by portfolio manager James O’Shaughnessy has shown that the P/S ratio is the best metric to demonstrate value. Under O’Shaugnessy’s method, neither Amazon or Google would be considered value stocks — his cutoff point was 1.5 or less. In addition, O’Shaughnessy liked to see five years of consecutive growth in earnings per share. That eliminates Amazon, whose earnings in recent years have been almost purposefully erratic. Fortunately, the question here isn’t whether Amazon or Google are value stocks, but rather which is the better value. The Value Case — FROIC This is the least known of the three valuation metrics I’m choosing to use for this particular stock showdown but it’s quite possibly the best one going because it tells us how much free cash a company is generating from its invested capital. There are a couple of steps involved. First, we need to calculate both Amazon and Google’s free cash flow in total dollars and on a per share basis. Then, we must calculate their total capital which is long-term debt plus shareholder equity. Once we’ve got that answer, we divide free cash flow by total capital and the answer we get tells us how good each company is at deploying capital. Amazon’s free cash flow for the trailing 12 months according to Morningstar was $7.33 billion. With 481 million shares outstanding, its free cash flow per share is $15.24 for a P/FCF ratio of 49.9. Google’s free cash flow for the trailing 12 months according to Morningstar was $20 billion. With 697 million shares outstanding, its free cash flow per share is $28.69 for a P/FCF ratio of 27.5. Google strikes the first blow. As of the second quarter, 2016, Amazon’s long-term debt was $8.2 billion; its shareholder equity $16.5 billion for total capital of $24.7 billion. That means AMZN generates 33 cents from every dollar of capital employed. As of Q2 2016, Google’s long-term debt was $2 billion; its shareholder equity $120.3 billion for total capital of $122.3 billion. That means Google generates 16 cents from every dollar of capital employed. iPhone 7 Reviews Are In: Apple Inc. Delivered in Spades Amazon strikes the second blow. The Better Value? This is a tough one. While Amazon exhibits better deployment of capital and is cheaper on a price-to-sales basis than Google, it’s hard to overlook the fact Amazon’s P/E and P/FCF ratios are considerably higher. In the end, Google might be the better value but Amazon is the better stock. As of this writing, Will Ashworth did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

The app, called Guide for Pokémon Go, can seize root access rights on Android devices and use that power to install and uninstall apps and display unwanted adverts. It was first discovered by researchers at Kaspersky Lab, who notified Google. The app has now been removed from the Play Store. Before it was taken down however, researchers say it was available throughout July 2016. They also found nine other apps containing the same Trojan available at various times dating back to December 2015. Kaspersky’s researchers said the app contains some “interesting features” that enable it to bypass detection once on a device. Instead of running as soon as it’s downloaded, the app waits for the user to install or uninstall another application and then runs checks to see if it’s on a real device or a virtual machine. “If it’s dealing with a device, the Trojan will then wait another two hours before starting its malicious activity. Even then, infection is not guaranteed,” Kaspersky said in a blog. “After connecting with its command server and uploading details of the infected device, including country, language, device model and OS version, the Trojan will wait for a response. Only if it hears back will it proceed with further requests and the downloading, installation and implementation of additional malware modules.” This means that not all users who download the app will subsequently become infected, Kaspersky said. It also provides the malicious app with an additional layer of security. Those users who are infected will see other applications installed and uninstalled, and unsolicited adverts displayed on their screen. “In the online world, wherever the consumers go, the cyber-criminals will be quick to follow,” said Roman Unuchek, Senior Malware Analyst, Kaspersky Lab. “Pokémon Go is no exception. Victims of this Trojan may, at least at first, not even notice the increase in annoying and disruptive advertising, but the long term implications of infection could be far more sinister. If you’ve been hit, then someone else is inside your phone and has control over the OS and everything you do and store on it.” Given the popularity of Pokémon Go, it’s no surprise to see cyber-criminals attempting to lure victims through malicious apps. Researchers recently discovered ransomware masquerading as a Pokémon Go app, while a malicious version of the wildly popular mobile game was released just a few hours after the game came out. The official version, meanwhile, has been criticised for the excessive permissions it requires when being installed.

Third-party developers will now have the ability to add the same URL checking to their Android apps with the new Safe Browsing API. Announced at I/O 2016, the device-local Safe Browsing API is available to all Android developers. Google notes that the API is simple and straightforward to use, with the same SafetyNet technology in use that has served hundreds of millions of warnings to millions of mobile users. It works by determining whether a URL has been marked as a known threat on Google’s constantly updating list. This includes social engineered phishing and deceptive sites that host malware and other unwanted software. If so, a bright red warning page is displayed with the option for users to return to safety. Conscientious of the constraints of mobile devices, the API keeps battery and bandwidth consumption to a minimum. As Chrome for Android and therefore Chrome Custom Tabs already include this protection, the API is more aimed at apps that have other web browsing capabilities. The Safe Browsing API is a part of the latest version of Google Play Services, thus allowing all Android developers and older hardware to take advantage of this service.

Google and P&G in Coalition to Police Ad Standards Across the Web By Emma Hall. Published on September 15, 2016. Reprints Reprints Google executive Sridhar Ramaswamy spoke at the Dmexco conference in Cologne, Germany, on Wednesday. Credit: Dmexco In possibly the broadest attempt yet to fix online advertising so that consumers don't become obsessed with blocking it, Google has got together with a diverse group of marketers, publishers, agencies and industry bodies to create The Coalition for Better Ads. Other participants include top global marketer Procter & Gamble, Unilever, The Washington Post, the 4As agency association, the Association of National Advertisers, the World Federation of Advertisers and GroupM, the world's largest ad buyer. The goal is to monitor the quality of ads using bespoke technology now in development at the Interactive Advertising Bureau's Tech Lab. Only ads that make it through the filter will be displayed on the websites of participating companies. Related Stories POLL: Why Is Adblock Plus Suddenly Selling Ads? In some ways the effort echoes the "Acceptable Ads" program run by Adblock Plus, under which the ad-blocking software lets certain ads through if it deems them unobtrusive and lightweight enough. Controversially, Adblock Plus charges large players in the ecosystem -- such as Google -- to participate. Under the Coalition for Better Ads plan, ads will be screened and scored according to a set of criteria that are expected to range from load time to creative execution. To help determine standards, the coalition will combine its members' expertise with information from consumers about the kind of online ads that they do and don't consume. In addition to the Washington Post, publishers and publishing bodies involved include Digital Context Next, the European Publishers Council and the News Media Alliance. The initiative was announced to coincide with the Dmexco conference in Cologne this week, with the scoring system expected to launch later this year. Google -- whose senior VP-ads and commercial, Sridhar Ramaswamy, has been speaking at Dmexco -- is taking an increasingly vocal stand against ad blocking. This week the internet giant ended its relationship with ComboTag, the ad buying platform that teamed up with AdBlock Plus to offer an ad exchange that served web ads to ad-blocking customers. "No industry has ever survived by ignoring consumer needs," said Jason Kint, CEO of Digital Content Next, in a statement. "DCN is looking forward to working with this coalition to address the underlying consumer needs that have accelerated ad blocking adoption." Ads funds the information, entertainment and services on much of the web, but ad sellers shouldn't abuse consumers, IAB President-CEO Randall Rothenberg said in a statement. "It is essential that industry create standards to assure that consumers get safe, fast, secure delivery of the sites and services they love." Ad blocking in the U.S. is set to grow 34% this year, taking nearly 70 million users – making up 26.3% of the market – out of the reaches of digital advertising, according to eMarketer. The number of ad blockers in the U.S. is expected to rise to 87 million in 2017. A global study by PageFair and Adobe showed year on year growth in ad blocking of 41% between the second quarter of 2014 and the second quarter of 2015. The report estimates that around the world $21.8 billion worth of ad revenues were blocked in 2015.

Home Church & Ministries U.S. World Politics Entertainment living Opinion Samsung Galaxy Tab S3 vs Google Nexus 7 2016: Battle of Upcoming Premium Tablets; Specs and Features Compared By Christian Ver Marcelo Sep 15, 2016 | 2:39 AM The tablet market has seen a slow decline in sales throughout the years. However, tech companies do not seem fazed by this fact though, as the playing field just keeps getting crowded with every new release. This year, Google and Samsung dish it out with the upcoming Nexus 7 and Galaxy Tab S3. Display Samsung has long reigned the display department as it has seemingly mastered the technology through its Galaxy smartphones. Consequently, these innovations will make their way to the Galaxy Tab S3 as it will feature the similar Super AMOLED panel and an upgraded 4K display resolution. There will be two variants, an 8-inch one and a 9.7-inch model. Google, however, has always partnered with other manufacturers to develop their devices. This year, they will once again collaborate with Huawei after the successful Nexus 6P smartphone. The Nexus 7 will, as the name implies, come with a 7-inch screen. It will then sport an AMOLED panel with a lower 2K Quad HD panel. Yes, I want Breaking Christian News Submit Performance The new Nexus 7 will most likely stick with Qualcomm chipsets, sporting a Snapdragon 820 or 821 as its main driver. It will then pack 4GB of RAM, with 64GB of on-board storage capacity. There is also a very slim chance that the tablet will pack Huawei's proprietary Kirin chipsets, but this is unlikely to happen. The Samsung Galaxy Tab S3 will then most probably launch with the Korean company's own Exynos chipset. The newest octa-core Exynos 8890 will power the device, along with a similar setup of 4GB RAM and either 32GB or 64GB of internal storage. Software and Battery The Nexus 7 is a step ahead in the game as it will launch with a stock Android 7.0 Nougat operating system out of the box. It will also receive the latest software updates faster, being a part of the Google product family. The Galaxy Tab S3 will then be running Android 6.0 Marshmallow, with Samsung's own TouchWiz skin on top. Being huge devices, both the Nexus 7 and the Galaxy Tab S3 will be equipped with equally immense batteries. Google and Huawei will pack a 5100 mAh battery with Quick Charge 3.0 on the Nexus 7. On to the Samsung side, the 8-inch model of the Galaxy Tab S3 will be sporting a 4000 mAh battery pack, with the 9.7-inch variant showcasing a huge 5870 mAh one. Pricing and Availability There are no official announcements yet as to the release of both tablets. However, leaks have reported that the Nexus 7 will be launched at Google's event on October 4, along with the new Pixel phones. The Samsung Galaxy Tab S3 will then reportedly bear a price tag of $420. No pricing information yet is rumored for the Google tablet.

The search giant was also in the news for the most recent version of Google Play (v6.9.15) causing battery life issues for some users. Google has responded to the latter reports on its product forums. Addressing the issue, Google Play Community Manager Amanda said, "We identified a bug affecting a small number of users in a recent release of the Google Play. For users in the error state, the Google Play app was unable to obtain GPS, causing it to make frequent unsuccessful requests and use battery. We will be rolling out a fix in the next few days." As Google says, users can expect a fix to come their way soon, solving their battery problem. Till then, they can revert to an older version of Google Play (v5.1.11 is reportedly not causing any problems), a method complaining users on the Google Product Forum resorted to.To recall, users have since last week been reporting Google Play v6.9.15 is eating up a lot of their battery, with a Searching for GPS notification being triggered and persisting despite attempts to remove it. As we mentioned, Google was in the news earlier this week when a security researcher accused it of tracking the location of Android users 24x7 via Google Play services. The researcher noted that if users attempt to disable location permission for Google Play services, they will be notified that the location services of the entire phone (and for all other apps that use Google's Play location API) will be disabled alongside.

Thank you for supporting the partners who make SitePoint possible. More from this author How Can Your Site Get into Google Answer Boxes? Retargeting: SEO & PPC Working Together Keyword Research: Finding Local Intent With over 2 million apps in the Apple App Store and the Google Play Store, you can find an app for anything. However, app publishers can struggle to get their apps to stand out from the crowd. Various app marketing techniques have proven to be helpful in order to improve app store discoverability, the most cost-effective being App Store Optimization (ASO). ASO is often compared to SEO, as it’s the process of optimizing certain elements in order to rank highly in app stores and increase app visibility. It’s a similar idea to how you would optimize a website to appear at the top of search results. While both of these practices rely on the same core principles, they still have their differences. They take place in different ecosystems — people searching in the App Store behave differently than when they search the web. Plus, app store algorithms work differently, using their own specific ranking factors. Given that over 63% of apps are discovered by general browsing or searching within the App Store, there’s no doubt ASO has to be part of any app marketing strategy. In this article, we’ll help you get started with ASO, outlining the most important elements that you need to optimize and their best practices. We’ll also provide you with some tips and advice to conduct effective keyword research with the help of useful keyword tools. Create a Unique App Before starting to even think about your app’s ASO and rankings, you need to make sure that your app is 100% perfectly designed and has a unique concept. Does your app solve a problem? Is it entertaining? Is your core functionality clearly defined? Does it offer a solid unique selling proposition that separates you from your competitors? Once you’re sure that your app is ready and functional, you can start focusing on optimizing your app’s Product Page. By optimizing your app’s metadata, you will increase your app’s authority in the App Store and position in the search results. This will increase your app’s organic downloads and, hopefully, your conversion rate. The first step in building your own strategy is to conduct a deep market and competitor analysis. If you understand your audience and your competitors, you’ll be able to find new opportunities that will increase your discoverability potential. How Does ASO work? As previously mentioned, ASO and SEO are easily compared. Search engine algorithms use multiple signals to rank pages in the search results, all weighted differently. These rankings factors vary from one search engine to another. It’s the exact same thing for app stores. Each store has its own rules and equations to rank apps. So it’s crucial to optimize your app according to the store you’re in. If both Apple and Google give indications on their ranking formula, a big part of the search results mechanism remains a mystery, therefore we can only make an educated “guess” as to how it works, based on experiments. Just like for SEO, ASO has on-metadata and off-metadata factors (“on page” and “off page” in SEO). On-metadata elements are factors that the app publishers can control and optimize the way they want (e.g: app title, description, etc.). On the other hand, off-metadata factors are totally independent and can’t be controlled, although they can be influenced (e.g: app downloads, reviews & ratings, etc.). Let’s review each ASO factor having an impact on your app’s rankings and see how you can optimize each of them. Optimize Your App’s Product Page App Icon You only get one chance to make a first impression. Don’t ruin it. Your app’s icon is one the first elements that users see when browsing the app store. Visual assets are one of the most influenctial factors, so they need to be perfectly crafted and designed. Since app users are probably confronted with many other apps similar to yours, you need to focus on your icon’s uniqueness. Your icon is your first opportunity to show off your app’s purpose. Together with your app title, they both should reflect what your app’s about. Your app icon needs to be appealing, relevant, memorable and eye-catching. All this in one tiny graphic asset. This makes the task quite challenging, so it’s essential to dedicate enough time to it. Try using a single focus point to capture users’ attention and avoid using details or text. Test your icon against different wallpapers as well. Don’t forget that app icons will constantly appear on your users’ background and that they will be tapped to open the app. A great trick is to use a border to reinforce the contrast with the background. The Apple App Store and the Google Play Store have their own requirements regarding sizes and rendering. Make sure to carefully follow the iOS Design Guidelines and the Android Graphic Assets Design Material. App Name Like your app icon, your app name should be appealing, easy to understand, straightforward and unique. It should be understood right away and reflect your app’s purpose. App titles are not only important in terms of conversion, they also play a notable role in app rankings. Indeed, both the Apple App Store and the Google Play Store algorithms allocate a huge importance to the keywords from app names. App names’ SEO sibling could be the title tag. Use your strongest keywords in your app title. Apple recently announced that iOS app titles should not be longer than 50 characters, in the aim of improving user’s experience and reducing keywords stuffing. On Google, the limit is even shorter at 30 characters. Keywords from app titles are therefore need to be chosen wisely. The best practice is to use a nice, simple brand name with 3 – 4 keywords creating a relevant sentence. Don’t forget to use URL-friendly characters so that the App Store can properly scan your keywords. Keywords Keywords certainly represent the biggest challenge in ASO. Whether on Apple or on Google, apps need to target specific keywords they want to rank in search results for. App keywords can actually be compared to the page content tag in SEO. Here again, Apple and Google work differently. Apple provides app developers with a 100-character iTunes Connect keyword field while Google scans keywords from the app description. Other keyword placements are also taken into account. Indeed, keywords from the app title, the app publisher name, the in-app purchases and the app category are used to rank apps as well. For the App Store, it is important to use all the available characters and to separate each keyword with commas instead of spaces. It is also highly encouraged to use single keywords instead of longtail keywords because it gives the algorithm more possible combinations. For Google Play, the mechanic is closer to SEO. Repeat each targeted keywords (choose about 10) 4-5 times and scatter them throughout your marketing-oriented copy, combined with various other keywords. Pay attention to keyword density and avoiding keyword stuffing. A great keyword is a keyword that is relevant to the app with high search volume and low competition. Indeed, the whole difficulty is to find keywords that users would type but at the same type would not bring too many app results. A great way to find effective keywords is to use the help of an online keyword tool. There are a lot of tools that you can use. Google provides the AdWords Keyword Planner, and although it focuses on the web, it can already give you a lot of ideas. Our personal favorite is AppTweak, the “WooRank of apps”. AppTweak provides a complete ASO report reviewing any app’s ASO performance as well as the tools and data required to find the best keywords for your app. The volume estimation relies on multiple parameters taken directly from the App Store. AppTweak also provides the KEI (Keywords Efficiency Index) for each keyword. This is an indicator between 1-100 that helps you understand keywords performance in terms of ranking difficulty. The higher the KEI, the higher the chance of ranking for the keyword. AppTweak also provides a lot of keywords suggestions such as the most used keywords in the app’s reviews; the app’s top ranked keywords; the app’s category top ranked keywords; auto-suggestions from Apple or Google and much more. Keyword research should always start with an in-depth competitor analysis to understand how your competitors are positioned in the store. Examine all the keywords present in their app name, description (for Google Play) and use the “Ranked Keywords” feature from AppTweak to check their top ranking keywords. These are certainly some of the ones they target in the iTunes Connect Keyword field (or description). The best practice here is to analyze as many keywords as possible (at least 100 per app and per language). Basically, any keyword that could be relevant to your app and that is more or less close to your app’s universe. From there, remove keywords that are too generic or popular. Make sure to avoid small KEIs and those you tried to rank for but never succeeded. A great strategy to annoy your competition is to take keywords for which they are ranking well (between the 1st and the 50th position) and use them in your app title, description or keyword field. Try using this strategy with apps at the same level as yours. If they’re ranking for these keywords, why wouldn’t you? However, it is also important to distinguish your app from your competitors by targeting keywords they don’t. You’ll need to find the right balance. The most important aspect to understand is that keyword rankings change often according to trends, app store changes or the competition. So it’s important to regularly monitor your keyword rankings and adapt your strategy accordingly. App Description Your app description will appear truncated on your app’s Product Page. If users tap on “more,” they’ll be able to view it entirely. This is why it is very important to maximize your efforts on the first lines of your copy. Make sure that it depicts what your app offers and its main features in just a few lines (2 – 3). Place a strong CTA there. Your app description should be customer-oriented, as it is a powerful conversion tool. Users don’t usually read app descriptions all the way; they’d rather quickly scan so make it as easy to read as possible. Using bullet points (or dashes) to list your unique features and benefits is a great trick to use. Do everything you can to convince users to download your app. Don’t forget to include your contact details at the end. Regarding the algorithms, Apple does not officially index keywords from app descriptions but it seems that they might have a small impact. However, iTunes app’s pages are indexed by web search engines, so make your Apple description SEO friendly. On Google, app descriptions are very important in terms of ASO and therefore should be optimized accordingly. As mentioned above, try targeting about 10 keywords and repeat them about 5 times each, combined with various other keywords. Don’t forget to update your description with any new features, changes or keywords. Screenshots and Videos App screenshots and videos are very important visual assets to catch users’ attention, just like your app’s icon. Users actually prefer looking at your screenshots rather than reading your description. It’s faster, easier and brings your app to life. Use all available screenshots slots (5 for Apple and 8 for Google) to leverage your conversion potential. Also, be sure to publish an app preview video, allowed on Apple since iOS8 (15 – 30 sec footage on the device directly) or a promo YouTube video of 30 sec – 2 min on Google Play. Showcase your best features and focus on the first seconds of the video to grab user’s attention. Of course, your visual material needs to be high-res, very well-designed and optimized for each screen size. Be sure to check the iTunes Connect Developer Guide and the Android Design Requirements for screenshots and video guidelines. In the search results, your first two screenshots are displayed (or the first one and your app video). Ensure that these first screenshots showcase your best features and most important benefits. A great trick is to focus on a single feature per screenshot while using a short overlay descriptive text above (or below) in order to highlight the key elements. The algorithm does not officially take into account the fact that you have published visual content but some theories claim the total number of views might have an impact on your app’s rankings. It certainly does have an impact in terms of conversion. Make sure to A/B test your screenshots and to localize them according to the region you’re targeting. Avoid using any text on Apple’s app preview videos as localization is not available. Reviews and Ratings App reviews and ratings are some of the most important off-metadata factors, along with downloads and conversion rate. They attest the quality and the authenticity of your app. When two apps are fighting over the same keyword, the algorithm uses these factors to determine search ranking. Reviews and ratings have a huge influence over the App Store algorithm and clearly play a large role in defining your app’s position in the store. There’s a high correlation between reviews and ratings and app ranking. Actually, both the average rating and the rating counts (number of ratings) are crucial in terms of app rankings. The total number of ratings has even more weight as it indicates the size of the community behind the app and its level of engagement. Having a regular stream of positive reviews & ratings will increase your app’s authority and weight in the store, especially in terms of keywords rankings. You are very unlikely see an app in the Top Charts with very low ratings or a small amount of them. Plus, from a marketing view, users’ feedback is very important to other users. Nowadays people are constantly looking for others’ opinions before eating at a restaurant, booking a hotel or buying a product. When browsing the App Store, users inevitably check out the average rating and the reviews when they’re on the app’s Product Page. Therefore, it’s crucial to encourage your users to rate your app as much as possible. A great strategy is to use a two-step pop-up notification process to ask feedback from your customers. Ask them first whether they like your app or not (or create a custom star-survey pop-up). If they reply positively (or above 4 stars), ask them to rate your app directly. If they reply with a negative feeling, send them to your feedback page and try to contact them. This technique will drastically increase your 5-star reviews. Also, it’s important to listen to your customers’ feedback as it can provide a powerful source of inspiration for your future developments: new features suggestions, bug fixes, improvements, etc. Always consider what your audience asks for or recommends. There’s a major difference between Apple and Google here. Google allows app developers to reply to their app reviews. They can therefore easily catch up with unsatisfied users and get them back. If your app is on Google Play, always make sure to reply to negative reviews in a positive and encouraging way. Don’t hesitate to ask family and friends to rate your app on its launch. It will give your app a massive boost and attract more users. Versions & Releases Recently, Apple announced that it will remove outdated and abandoned apps from its store with the goal being a massive clean up of all zombie apps that are polluting the app store and tainting user’s experience. Apps must now make an update every 30 days or they will be removed. An app’s freshness is a crucial and determinant factor in the App Store — from both a marketing and an algorithmic view. Updated and fresh apps will attract more users (who are always seeking improvements and novelty) and frequently updated apps will also be favored by the search algorithm. Fresh apps will mostly rank higher in the results than older apps for both Google and Apple. However, it can be challenging to make your actual users download your new app version. A great way is to prompt them with an encouraging push notification listing your new features and benefits. It’s also very important to write a compelling “What’s New” section, including strong keywords. For each new release you make, take the opportunity to update your ASO strategy. After a thorough analysis of your keywords’ rankings (as well as your competitors’ rankings), select new keywords to replace the ones you’re not ranking. Don’t forget that your ratings reset for each update you make. This can give you a great opportunity to start from scratch and get rid of negative reviews. However, if you have a lot of great reviews and ratings, it might take you a little while to get these back. But if your app was liked before, there’s no reason why your new update would displease your users. Conclusion In an effort to keep a high level of quality for their apps, both Apple and Google seem to rely on app conversions and retention. So ASO isn’t all about downloads, but rather about finding sticky users that will keep using your app and stay engaged. Focus primarily on the quality of your app and use marketing techniques, including push notifications, to keep your users engaged. Setting some KPIs to track impressions, pageviews, downloads, retention and engagement will help you monitor your ASO efforts over time and find opportunities to improve your app and keyword rankings. And most of all, remember that App Store Optimization is not a miracle pill that will push your app to the top of the results. It’s an ongoing process that constantly needs to be updated and tweaked as part of a global app marketing strategy.

A couple of small (but important) clarifications that I wanted to point out about ASO keywords… 1. The first thing to look for is “download relevant” keywords. If someone searches for this keyword, do they have the intent of downloading an app? The keyword could be relevant to the app or topic, but not have download intent. 2. High volume AND low competition is ideal, but often not possible. So it is best to prioritize low competition first, and make sure that there is at least some search volume. It’s better to rank #1 for a low volume keyword, than to rank #302 for a high volume keyword. This means looking for long-tail keywords: https://www.mobileaction.co/blog/long-tail-aso-keywords/ In SEO, you should usually look for 4 word keywords first. Similarly, in ASO, you should start by looking for 2-4 word keywords. If you are a mega app, then it doesn’t matter too much. But for all of the other apps out there, long-tail keywords are going to help a lot. This is where a lot of app marketers get frustrated. Build your downloads on lower volume keywords, then work your way up as your app gets more popular. Hope that helps!

In the wildly popular mobile game Pokémon Go, the ultimate goal is to capture as many Pokémon as possible. For the creators of a malware-laden app some devious designers snuck into the Google Play store, the objective was similar—except for smartphone users—and they were quite successful.  Before it was pulled from the online marketplace earlier this week, Guide for Pokémon Go, a malicious app, was downloaded over half a million times. The app's true nature was discovered by researchers at the cybersecurity firm Kaspersky Lab, who notified Google. However, by the time the app was removed, at least 6,000 devices has been infected—primarily belonging to users in Russia, India, and Indonesia. “In the online world, wherever the consumers go, the cybercriminals will be quick to follow...Pokémon Go is no exception” Kaspersky Senior Malware Analyst Roman Unuchek said in a statement. He continued:  Victims of this Trojan may, at least at first, not even notice the increase in annoying and disruptive advertising, but the long term implications of infection could be far more sinister. If you’ve been hit, then someone else is inside your phone and has control over the OS and everything you do and store on it. Even though the app has now been removed from the store, there’s up to half a million people out there vulnerable to infection – and we hope this announcement will alert them to the need to take action. In a blog post, Kaspersky researchers laid out how the app's designers ingeniously designed the trojan to avoid detection: The “Guide for Pokémon Go” root Trojan includes some interesting features that help it to bypass detection. It doesn’t start as soon as the victim launches the app. Instead, it waits for the user to install or uninstall another app, and then checks to see whether that app runs on a real device or on a virtual machine. If it’s dealing with a device, the Trojan will then wait another two hours before starting its malicious activity. Even then, infection is not guaranteed. After connecting with its command server and uploading details of the infected device, including country, language, device model and OS version, the Trojan will wait for a response. Only if it hears back will it proceed with further requests and the downloading, installation and implementation of additional malware modules. This approach means that the control server can stop the attack from proceeding if it wants to - skipping those users it does not wish to target, or those which it suspects are a sandbox/virtual machine, for example. This provides an additional layer of protection for the malware. Once rooting rights have been enabled, the Trojan will install its modules into the device’s system folders, silently installing and uninstalling other apps and displaying unsolicited ads to the user. Immediately following its release, Pokémon Go instantly became one of the most successful mobile games in history. At one point, it was attracting more daily users than Twitter and greater user engagement than Facebook. However, as the luster of the game's pioneering use of augmented reality technology has faded, its audience has dropped by 79 percent. Even so, it's still generating seven times as much revenue as its closest mobile gaming competitor, Candy Crush Saga. This incident isn't the first time hackers have targeted Pokémon hunters. In the first weeks after the app launched, it was only available in the United States, Australia, and New Zealand. If gamers in the rest of the world wanted to play, they had to “side-load”the application by downloading it through channels outside of the major, mainstream app stores. That opened up users to inadvertently downloading malware that allowed hackers to gain complete control over their devices when they believed they were only installing the game.  Facebook View all 696 stories → Google View all 933 stories → Twitter View all 422 stories → Cybercriminals targeting eager Pokémon Go users with malware Read Story → Layer 8 Parsec Pokemon Go Up next after the break: Promoted Stories Powered by Sharethrough layer 8 The megalomaniac dictator who hid the Door to Hell: Layer 8 Podcast In a country where wild-eyed plutocrats and resource-rich egomaniacs reign supreme, a few brave Turkmen are challenging their government's iron-fisted rule.

Davey Alba Business Date of Publication: 09.15.16. 09.15.16 Time of Publication: 1:27 pm. 1:27 pm Need Some AI? Yeah, There’s a Marketplace for That Algorithmia Diego Oppenheimer is worried that the Googles and the Facebooks will dominate the world of artificial intelligence. It’s a legitimate worry. Elon Musk and Sam Altman are worried about the same thing. That’s why they created a startup called OpenAI. In recent years, Google and Facebook have snapped up so many researchers at the heart of the deep learning movement, an AI movement that’s rapidly reinventing everything from speech recognition to security. So, Musk and Altman grabbed several top AI researchers from Google and Facebook and vowed to share their work with the world at large. Now, Oppenheimer and his startup, Algorithmia, are doing their part in the battle against AI hegemony. Algorithmia is what Oppenheimer calls an open marketplace for algorithms—code that companies and developers can use to beef up their websites and apps—and this marketplace now includes deep learning algorithms that handle tasks like face recognition and character recognition. Whereas OpenAI shares raw AI research, Algorithmia offers working algorithms designed to slot right into new services. “Maybe the future was already invented,” Oppenheimer says. “It’s just stuck in academic papers.” It’s part of a much larger effort to democratize AI. Startups like Clarifai, Nara Logics, and MetaMind (now owned by Salesforce.com) also offer tools for building deep learning into any application. And giants like Google, Amazon, and Microsoft are building cloud computing services that work in similar ways. Algorithmia uses the same marketplace model that startups have applied to so many other goods and services, including everything from artisanal crafts and graphic design to real estate and good ol’ retail. Anyone can upload an algorithm to the market, and then anyone can pay to use it. The author of the algorithm chooses the price of each API call (free to one dollar), and then 70 percent of the proceeds go to the author, with Algorithmia keeping the rest. When an algorithm is completely open source, Algorithmia charges only for the computing power used. What’s new are the deep learning algorithms. Today, Algorithmia offers just over 2,500 algorithms, sixteen of which are deep learning models added by coders in July, at the urging of Oppenheimer and company. Loosely based on the networks of neurons in the human brain, deep neural nets can learn discrete tasks by analyzing enormous amounts of data. Oppenheimer points to the Colorize algorithm—which uses deep learning to automatically colorize black and white photos—as a prime example. Colorize was built the UC Berkeley Vision Lab, as part of a graduate student’s academic paper, and the Algorithmia team urged him to upload the algorithm to their marketplace. Oren Etzioni, CEO of the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence and an investor in Algorithmia, believes these algorithm can help transform deep learning from a “dark art” practiced only by the giants of the Internet into a technology used by “the 99 percent.” Dennis R. Mortensen, the CEO and founder of the artificial intelligence startup x.ai, agrees—up to a point. He adds that these algorithms serve only some needs. As he points out, other companies are providing more complex tools for building deep learning systems, including Google, which recently open sourced a deep learning software engine called TensorFlow. He also points out that deep learning requires enormous amounts of data for training. Just because you have the algorithm, he says, that doesn’t mean you’ll get useful results. Algorithmia won’t help build the most advanced AI, he says, but it will help you layer a little AI into your app. Go Back to Top.

ShareTweet SubscribeWeld for Birmingham Nick Patterson The ubiquitous internet company which has made art fun, gives you or your offspring a chance to get into the act with your very own… Image courtesy of Google. It’s amazing how much of our lives have been infiltrated by Google. For a number of years now, the search-engine driven megalith has enthralled users with its cleverly informative doodles, which open up your database to all sorts of interesting facts about Hedy Lamarr, or as this is being written, Yma Sumac, the Peruvian soprano who was one of the main proponents of exotica music in the 1950s. And in the creative spirit the company is known for fostering, for a few years, Google has been inviting kids to get involved by designing their own Google Doodle. To be precise, the competition is called Doodle 4 Google, and it’s open to students from kindergarten through 12th grade from anywhere in the U.S. including Puerto Rico and Guam, who love art and are willing to share their talent with the world’s biggest internet company and potentially — well, everyone Google reaches. The young artists are invited to bring their talents to bear on the Google logo — which, for the uninitiated, has taken on a myriad of forms and guises over the years — creating a version in any medium they choose. The winning design will be what millions of Google users see for one day when they go to the site to look something up. There is a theme for the contest: “What I see for the future” which can literally be anything they can envision for the future, whether personal or of a more universal appeal. Doodle 4 Google now has quite a history. As noted on its very own website, it’s an outgrowth of the Google produced doodles which are so popular: In 1998, before the company was even incorporated, the concept of the doodle was born when Google founders Larry and Sergey played with the corporate logo to indicate their attendance at the Burning Man festival in the Nevada desert. They placed a stick figure drawing behind the 2nd “o” in the word, Google, and the revised logo was intended as a comical message to Google users that the founders were “out of office.” While the first doodle was relatively simple, the idea of decorating the company logo to celebrate notable events was born. Two years later the current webmaster was asked to create a doodle for Bastille Day, and the rest is history: “It was so well received by our users that Dennis [Hwang] was appointed Google’s chief doodler and doodles started showing up more and more regularly on the Google homepage,” said the history on the website. So now, maybe it’s your turn — or that of an appropriately aged artist you know. The contest will be officially announced Wednesday, September 14. So everything you need to know will be available here: doodles.google.com/d4g. And if you forget that URL, don’t worry; you’ll be able to Google it.

Close share panel Image copyright Google Image caption Google said its face-blurring technology had been "a little overzealous" A bullock that had its face blurred by Google Street View has proved a hit on social media. The animal was snapped by Google's cameras at Coe Fen, Cambridge, and seemingly given the same treatment humans receive for privacy reasons. A tweet by The Guardian's David Shariatmadari highlighting the sight was retweeted more than 9,000 times. Google admitted its face-blurring technology had been "a little overzealous". Bovine anomaly The animal's face can clearly be seen grazing near the river River Cam on an image taken slightly further away, but Google seems to have blurred it for a close-up view. Image copyright Google Image caption The mysterious bullock's identity can be seen in all its glory moments before Google's Street View launched in 2007 and received widespread media coverage as cars mounted with cameras mapped streets around the world. To help combat privacy concerns, software is used to automatically blur human faces. Mr Shariatmadari spotted the bovine anomaly and posted it on Twitter, saying it was "great to see Google takes cow privacy seriously". "Udderly ridiculous," said one user in reply. "Google teat view," said another. It has also been reported by the Cambridge News and national media. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Google's cameras began photographing the world's streets in 2007 So far the tweet has been liked more than 12,000 times. A spokesman for Google said: "We thought you were pulling the udder one when we herd the moos, but it's clear that our automatic face-blurring technology has been a little overzealous. "Of course, we don't begrudge this cow milking its five minutes of fame."

Microsoft is now once again stating that Edge offers the best performance, leading to more controversy. In June, Microsoft published a blog post that appeared to prove Edge offers 50 percent more battery power than Chrome, Firefox and Opera. Naturally, Google and Mozilla weren't too pleased by the claim. Opera suggested Microsoft's testing techniques were flawed, assuring users its browser was actually the winner. It conducted its own tests that, inevitably, proved its claim. Google later followed suit. Fast forward a few months and Microsoft has returned. On the back of the recently launched Windows 10 Anniversary Update, the company is claiming that Microsoft Edge now offers as much as 69% more battery life than the competition. The browser has been tuned for power efficiency, including improved background tab management, reductions in Flash's power consumption and optimisations to Windows' system-level networking. Describing Edge as "more efficient than ever," Microsoft has run updated tests on Edge, Chrome, Firefox and Opera. The results were predictably favourable for Edge. The browser was 24 percent to 43 percent more efficient than Microsoft's rivals in general browsing, and 23 percent to 69 percent more efficient when streaming video. Microsoft's updated Edge battery performance claims Microsoft Microsoft took the latest versions of each browser, left the settings at default and ran them on one of its own factory-fresh Surface Book laptops. Power saving modes that are usually enabled by default, such as Opera Battery Saver, were left turned on. Microsoft said it views this as a fair and open approach to testing battery performance but invited outsiders to weigh in with their own opinions. Microsoft repeated the same tests as before, coming up with largely the same results. In the Netflix streaming test, Firefox was the first to bow out after five hours, 11 minutes and 34 seconds. Chrome came next, at just over six hours, followed by Opera at seven hours and eight minutes. Edge lasted for almost eight and a half hours, depleting the battery in eight hours, 24 minutes and 54 seconds. Microsoft acknowledged the uproar its last blog post created, saying it is "thrilled" to have created the current "spirited debate". The new test took the responses of the competitors into account but was still based on the same methodologies as before. In anticipation of creating the same controversy again, the company has published a detailed explanation of how it tests battery life with a justification for its methods. Microsoft's updated Edge battery performance claims Microsoft It said its lab tests simulate "common real-world activities" including searching, video playback, shopping and reading email. Multiple tabs are used actively and in the background to simulate a natural browsing session for every kind of user. Power consumption is computed using hardware monitors attached to each individual device. To back up the lab tests, Microsoft also includes aggregated data collected from telemetry outputs from the millions of Windows 10 devices in use worldwide. According to Microsoft's graphs, this real-world data is consistent with the results of the lab benchmarks, giving it the confidence to make its bold claims. "From the moment we decided to revisit our tests, we were committed to measuring real-world scenarios with a completely transparent methodology," said Microsoft. To back up our results, we’re open sourcing our lab test on GitHub and publishing the full methodology for our video tests, so anyone can see the setup and even reproduce the tests independently." Microsoft's updated Edge battery performance claims Microsoft The company invited people to contribute to the discussion, whether they agree with or contest its views. To this end, it has open sourced its battery tests and uploaded them to GitHub. This allows anyone to run the lab test on their own devices, externally validating Microsoft's results. It has also written a full methodology evaluation for its video streaming tests. While the "battery war" may seem trivial from the outside, consumers should hope it continues for as long as possible. All the major browser vendors have become passionately involved in a debate that directly improves the experience of users. The browser is often the most-used program on a device, making tangible battery life improvements beneficial to millions of people. The quest to improve the power efficiency of web browsers is now healthier than it has ever been, due to the competition created by the antagonistic claims of each vendor. A fresh response from Google, Mozilla and Opera is likely, inspiring further improvements in all four browsers.

I am just happy that John Mueller and friends decided to keep it up and not stop the hangouts because of Google closing them on Google+. The first two hangouts were scheduled by John Mueller and posted on Google+. John asked you post your questions on Google+ because YouTube Live's version of Hangouts is missing the QA feature that Google+'s version had. The first one is on September 20th and the second one is on September 23rd, here are the embeds: John said: Add your questions to this Google+ post. This session is open to anything webmaster related like crawling, indexing, mobile sites, internationalization, duplicate content, Sitemaps, Search Console, pagination, duplicate content, multi-lingual/multi-regional sites, etc. This is a Hangout on YouTube Live.

With these new ad types, Google looks beyond the initial app install to discover how to keep users engaged in meaningful ways. Next Gen Universal App Campaigns The first of the two ad innovations announced this week is the “next generation” of Universal App Campaigns, which is available worldwide right now to all advertisers. Universal App Campaigns allow you to reach customers with in-app advertisements across Google Search, Play, YouTube, and the Google Display Network. Advertisers are free to choose the in-app activity to optimize for; whether that’s tapping on a promotion for the latest sale, or beating the first level of a video game. Those kinds of activities are measured using Google’s app management solutions, like Firebase Analytics. Once the app campaign is up and running, Google begins to collect data and learn how people engage with your ads. The campaign will continually refine its own ads so you can reach the right customers, in the right places, at the right times. For example, if it’s found that people who tap on a lot of travel ads also watch a lot of travel vlogs, then they will be served ads for more travel deals on YouTube. TrueView for Action YouTube’s TrueView for apps promotion allows marketers to drive more purchases and downloads — but what if you’re not trying to get people to buy or download anything? Maybe you want people to request a quote, book a consultation, or sign up for a newsletter. There are many types of conversions that do not involve purchases or downloads, which is why YouTube is introducing TrueView for action. These ads will appear in conjunction with video ads, as a card with a call to action at the very bottom. The card can be customized with any kind of call to action you wish. Again, both TrueView for action and upgraded universal app campaigns are now available to all advertisers around the world.

MSPU Windows Phone Windows 10 Surface Xbox Enterprise Tip us Settings Text Input: Windows 10 Windows Phone Surface Xbox Enterprise Settings Tip us Forum Text Input: Outlook gets Google Drive and Facebook Photos integration on the web 0 by Mehedi Hassan  @mehedih_ Sep 15, 2016 at 16:27 GMT2 months ago Microsoft today announced some interesting new features for Outlook on the web. The company is bringing integration for Google Drive and Facebook to Outlook.com, allowing users to attach their photos from their Facebook profile or Google Drive account very easily to an email. And if you have lots of pictures on Facebook — don’t fret as Outlook shows “Photos of me” and your own photos in separate sections, which can be quite helpful if your Facebook friends randomly tag you on their photos. Additionally, when someone shares a document from Google Drive on an email, Outlook.com will now open those documents directly in the email, rather than opening a separate page for Google Drive. For example, if someone shares a Google Doc from Google Drive with you via shared link, clicking on it will open the document directly on Outlook.com — rather than opening the link in your web browser. Lastly, Microsoft is also making it much easier to find attachments on long conversations. If you have long conversations where someone shares documents with you in different emails, Outlook.com will show an attachment icon on the top of the conversation — and clicking on it will show all the attachments that are present in that specific conversation. This is a major new improvement, which will save quite a lot of your time if you struggle to find an attachment on long email threads. Keep in mind that these features are only available to users with the new Outlook.com experience and even if you have the new Outlook.com experience, the features may not be available as Microsoft is rolling them out over the next few weeks.

Now all we have to do is forget Angular 1.   Angular is a framework for building JavaScript apps and dynamic web pages. It is important because it is a good framework and because it has Google behind it - although of course for some this is a negative. Angular approaches the problem of building a UI from the declarative point of view. Special tags are placed in the HTML and the JavaScript scans the HTML and replaces the tags with data. The binding is two-way so program values are updated when the HTMl changes due to user input and the HTML changes when the values change due to program action. Angular 1 proved very popular as a way of creating sophisticated JavaScript app. However, there was general consternation when it was announced that Angular 1 was doing mostly the right thing, but in the wrong way, and Angular 2 would be a complete re-write. As the launch announcement puts it: "Angular 1 first solved the problem of how to develop for an emerging web. Six years later, the challenges faced by today’s application developers, and the sophistication of the devices that applications must support, have both changed immensely. With this release, and its more capable versions of the Router, Forms, and other core APIs, today you can build amazing apps for any platform. If you prefer your own approach, Angular is also modular and flexible, so you can use your favorite third-party library or write your own." The new version was planned to deal with mobile as a first priority, only work with modern browsers and, rather than use plain JavaScript, Microsoft's TypeScript would be the language used.  This approach would either kill Angular 1, Angular 2 or both. As things seem to be turning out Angular 2 is still of great interest and Angular 1 is for legacy only. This means that most Angular programmer have been using the betas and release candidates to get ahead and won't be surprised by anything in the final release.   The good news is that Angular 2 is here and we can start using it without reservations about production quality or not. The new version also introduces semantic versioning with the usual major.minor.patch numbering.  So where next? It is to be hoped that the stability of version 2.0.0 gives everyone time to consolidate and write some good documentation. Planned for the future are: Bug fixes and non-breaking features for APIs marked as stable More guides and live examples specific to your use cases More work on animations Angular Material 2 Moving WebWorkers out of experimental More features and more languages for Angular Universal Even more speed and payload size improvements   The one thing that Angular programmers really don't want to read is that version 2.1.0 isn't backward compatible with 2.0.0 - but they wouldn't do that would they?   More Information Angular, version 2: proprioception-reinforcement Related Articles Angular Partners With TypeScript  Angular 2 Fundamentals - The Coolest Course In Existence  The Weekly Top 10: AngularJS Web Development Resources  Angular 2: Built on TypeScript Angular 2.0  ngconf2015 demo on GitHub   To be informed about new articles on I Programmer, sign up for our weekly newsletter, subscribe to the RSS feed and follow us on, Twitter, Facebook, Google+ or Linkedin.    Gain A Competitive Edge With Uber's Driver API 08/11/2016 A new sort of API, invokable by 3rd party consumers and carrying brand new functionality, finds its way to Uber's repository's already rich collection of APIs and Uber is offering developers beta acce [ ... ] + Full Story The Weekly Top 10: Ruby On Rails Resources 03/11/2016 The spotlight turns to Ruby on Rails, and the recently released Rails 5, for this week's collection of posts from external blogs which we hope you'll find of interest. + Full Story More News RStudio Adds SparklyR Support //No Comment - TDD, C++ Lambdas & Agile Under Scrutiny HTML 5.1 Is Here Jumpstart Your Career In Game Development With Udemy WebAssemby Another Milestone Microsoft Open Sources P Passive Haptic Learning - The No Effort Way To Learn Rewritten Search For NPM 4.0 Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit Version 2.0 Beta Deep Mind and StarCraft II For Reinforcement Learning Microsoft Turns LightSwitch Off European Astro Pi Challenge Take VisionMobile's Gamified Developer Survey         Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. blog comments powered by Disqus Last Updated ( Thursday, 15 September 2016 )     Follow @Iprogrammerinfo     RSS feed of news items only Copyright © 2016 i-programmer.info.

The OpenStack flinger has bought TCP Cloud, a 30-person specialist in running managed services on OpenStack, OpenContrail and Kubernetes. The purchase buys TCP Cloud’s open-source MK.20 technology. Financial terms for the Czech Republic-based firm were not disclosed. MK.20 uses a design pattern employed by AWS, Google Compute Cloud and Microsoft Azure to maintain their clouds. It tackles the problem of deploying and managing upgrades when using OpenStack as a micro service via Google’s Kubernetes. Mirantis in August announced a partnership with Google and Intel to run OpenStack as containers, orchestrated using the Kubernetes orchestration tool. It was an inversion of a dominant idea of having containers work well on OpenStack. TCP Cloud’s software lets you manage integration points, the lifecycle of services, and managing infrastructure as code. It deals with version control, with all code managed centrally, via GitHub, acting as a single source of truth. Alex Freedland, Mirantis chief executive, reckoned the big advantage of MK.20 is it saves OpenStack users the job of building such tooling themselves. “The guys in TCP Cloud were thinking of industrial scale from day one,” he told The Reg. “Today nothing like this has been productized.” Through its acquisition, MK.20 will be integrated with Mirantis’ Fuel software to deploy and manage OpenStack clouds and resources. Founded in 2011, Mirantis is emerging as a strong independent name in OpenStack. The firm has not just survived a period of consolidation, but has attracted venture support – $200m in four rounds. Freedland claimed Mirantis now employs 900 people and has a business run rate of nearly $100m. ® Sponsored: The state of mobile security maturity Tips and corrections Post a comment Whitepapers Data and Analytics Maturity Model and Business Impact How top performing enterprises use their IT investments to store, process, and use data to make more effective, real-time decisions.

Computing Mobile Internet Gaming Electronics Extreme Deep Dives Deals About ExtremeTech ET Forums Contact ExtremeTech Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ziff Davis Home Extreme Google may be adding speed limits to Google Maps Google may be adding speed limits to Google Maps By Bill Howard on September 15, 2016 at 11:23 am Comment It’s long overdue: a speed limit indicator on Google Maps. It appears to be showing up on some users’ phones, according to multiple user reports, but not everywhere. So far it appears to be just the posted speed limit, not the car’s actual speed, without an indication if you’re driving over the limit. Posted and actual are obviously useful together, especially since the GPS-derived is typically spot-on. The car’s speedometer often overstates your actual speed by a couple miles per hour. Google has had little to say initially beyond the usual upbeat response that Google continually seeks out new features that might be useful, and some appear if user feedback is positive. It’s also not certain if Android phones would get the feature before Apple iOS (as on the artist rendition in the main image). If your car supports Android Auto, then the information on the car’s LCD should show this as well, once Google is good and ready. Why the posted speed limit is important on your phone If you’re a person who drives close to the limit, meaning 75 in a 65 zone — where “limit” means the upper boundary for driving, beyond which you’re becoming visible to the authorities — you want to know your exact speed. Automakers may show the speedometer at 65 mph when you’re actually doing 62-64 mph just in case you have a tire with a circumference slightly larger than the original rubber (and each revolution carries the car slightly farther, meaning higher speed). Even better is when your device shows the posted speed limit, your exact speed, and a warning when you reach or exceed the limit. Waze does that already, and it’s one of the many reasons this app has become so popular. So popular, in fact, that Google spent a reported $1.3 billion to acquire Waze. There’s room for a smarter excessive-speed warning. It’s little help to have the speed limit sign or your actual speed outlined in red the moment when you accelerate to 66 in a 65 zone. You may want to know that when you hit 76 in a 65 zone. That’s certainly do-able, especially if you can have multiple triggers: say, 6 mph over for speeds under 50 mph, 8 mph for 50-60, and 11 mph over for 50 and above. A Waze-like app could — theoretically here — temporarily reduce the posted-versus-actual margin if others report a significant police presence nearby. Public safety officials say speeding tickets only improve safety. Drivers, and an increasing number of newspapers, along with some legislators, recognize that it’s really about revenue. Speed info took its sweet time coming to on-board navi Many, not all, car navigation systems now show the posted speed limit, or at least what the limit was when the data was burned into a DVD or SD card. Most owners don’t buy update discs or memory cards when the new data costs $200. Some may show your car’s speed as well (on the navigation map), although it’s synced to the car speedometer, which typically runs off tire rotation and is subject to inaccuracies. And some highlight the speed limit sign on the dashboard map when you exceed the posted speed. Some cars with head-up displays (HUDs) are showing speed limits, too. BMW (image above) shows posted speed (the red 120 kph circle, or 75 mph), the car’s actual speed (the white 106), and the speed setting for cruise control or adaptive cruise control (the green 120). It took years for automakers to start putting speed limit information into on-board navigation systems. Automakers argued they might try to hold the automakers responsible if the speed limit was reduced, the driver relied on old map information, and got a ticket. Meanwhile, the Garmins and TomToms included speed limit info at far lower prices for their devices than for on-board navigation. On-board navigation, although still wildly expensive (at least in buyers’ minds), has one trick that smartphones can’t match yet: The same windshield camera that handles lane departure warning and forward collision warning can also read roadside signs, including speed limit signs — especially those that have changed for construction zones, and possibly even for short-term events such a severe weather.

Toggle Navigation A-   A+ Sign in News   Stock Home «Back Indonesia to probe Google over alleged unpaid tax bill AFP | Jakarta Sep 15, 2016 09:02 PM IST Indonesia said today it would launch investigations into Google after the technology giant allegedly refused to cooperate with the country's tax department, an official said. Google has denied the allegations, declaring it had paid all taxes in Indonesia since opening its Jakarta offices in 2011. The government has repeatedly asserted the California-based company had outstanding tax issues to resolve. Muhammad Haniv, a senior official with Jakarta's tax office, said Google had refused a request to allow tax officials to examine its financial statements. "We are now elevating this to an investigation, because they refused to be examined. This could be classified as a criminal offence," Haniv told AFP, adding Google generates tens of millions in advertising revenue but contributed little in tax. In a statement Jason Tedjasukmana, the head of corporate communications for Google Indonesia, said the company had always worked closely with the government and had "complied by paying all taxes which apply in Indonesia". Jakarta has also applied pressure to other foreign tech behemoths such as Facebook and Yahoo over their tax arrangements inside Indonesia. Global tech businesses have flooded Indonesia in recent years to capitalise on the exploding number of internet users in the Southeast Asian nation, which has an enormous youth population adept at using smartphones. A third of Indonesia's 255 million have access to the internet but analysts say that number is likely to increase as connectivity improves across the sprawling archipelago.

The 332-year-old building has remained off-limits to tourists, but Street View pictures offer a private tour. Google 9 The famous stairs leading up into the Prime Minister’s office You can snoop around behind the famous black door and see the landmark home of Britain’s Prime Minister for generations. From today users can take a look at the official residence, including drawing rooms, the grand dining hall from hosting foreign dignitaries, and the green-topped Cabinet table. They can also look at Thatcher Room, used as the late PM’s main office, and the rose garden, made famous when David Cameron and Nick Clegg held a press conference to announce the Coalition government in 2010. Google 9 You get to finally look behind the famous black door Google 9 Users can snoop around the green-topped Cabinet table Google 9 And take a look at the opulent official residence of the UK’s Prime Minister The pics are from January 2016 so there is no chance of catching glimpse of Theresa May hard at work, neither is there a shot of Larry the cat trying to catch any mice. But there are a host of priceless portraits on display, as well as a feel for the decadence of the UK’s most famous political address. Google 9 There is a grand dining room for hosting foreign dignitaries Google 9 The outside of Downing Street has been on Google Maps before but this is the first time you can go inside Google 9 The staircase is lined with portraits of Prime Minister from over the decades Downing Street itself has been included on Google Street View since 2012, but this is the first time users have been allowed inside. The decision to map it is part of an effort from Google’s Cultural Institute to try and chronicle the world’s most famous buildings and preserve them digitally. RELATED STORIES: OH PRIME MINISTER!

Whether this is a useful feature or another over-the-top tracking feature, depends on your level of privacy safeguarding. I personally don’t mind Google tracking my location because I find the benefits outweigh the negatives. In any case, if Location History is enabled, you can use Google Maps to view your exact travel paths for any day on a map, which is pretty cool. In this article, I’ll talk about how you can view this history and also how to check if you have Location History enabled or disabled. If you just want to learn how to view the timeline, skip down to the View Maps Timeline section. Turn Location History On/Off Depending on your device, there are several ways to turn on or turn off location history for a device. Note that each device you own can have location history enabled or disabled. So if you have Google Maps installed on an Android device, an iPhone and a tablet, each device will record location history and it’ll be combined when you view it using the timeline. Desktop/Laptop If you’re using a laptop or desktop computer, the easiest way to change these settings is to go to Google Activity Controls. Scroll down until you see Location History and you can click on the toggle button to enable or disable it. Note that doing it here will enable/disable location history for your entire account, regardless of which devices had location history enabled. Just FYI, this screen also lets you control a whole lot of other settings like YouTube search and watch history, voice and audio history, web and app activity and device information. Android On Android devices, you have to go to the Settings app. Tap on the all apps icon at the center and then tap on Settings. Scroll down until you get to the Personal section and the first item should be Location. You might see something like ON / High accuracy if you have it enabled. Tap on this and you’ll now be able to turn off location history for this particular device. If you notice, there is another option called Google Location History. If you tap on this option, you’ll see a list of all your enabled devices and you can disable location history for the entire account. iPhone On the iPhone, there are a couple of ways to go about changing this setting. The first and easiest way is to simply open Google Maps and then tap on the hamburger icon at the very top left. Then tap on Settings towards the bottom of the menu. Scroll down to Location History and tap on that. You can now change the setting here for just the device or for the whole account. If you have the Google search app installed on your phone, you can go there, tap on your email at the top left, then tap on Privacy, and then on Location. Here you can manage Location History and Location Reporting, which are two different features. View Google Maps Timeline OK, so now for the actual fun part! To view your timeline, simply visit the maps timeline link. The main screen will give you an overview of your location history. The first thing you’ll notice is the large map in the center with a bunch of red dots. Each one of these drops corresponds to a trip you have made. If you double-click on the red dot, you’ll be brought to that specific time period and you’ll see the route traveled. In the above example, I was travelling from New Orleans to Gadsden, AL on September 11th, 2014. This was our trip back from my parents’ home to our home in Maryland. We stopped one night in Alabama along the way. Across the bottom, you can click on any specific day to see your daily travels. The individual days are really cool because if you happened to have taken photos and you saved them using Google Photos, they will show up in the timeline too. As you can see, we walked around the lake area during this day and we took some pictures at the lake, which show up in the left-hand side. It’s pretty cool! It even tells you how far you walked and for how long! If you go back to the main screen, you can also click the two big icons at the bottom. One will say something like X Places, See your most visited places and the other will say More Trips. This is a quick way to see the most common places you go to and to quickly see all your major trips/travels. Overall, it’s really cool if you don’t mind the fact that Google knows where you are all the time. If you can live with that, you can see some pretty cool information about yourself. It’s worth noting that you can delete your location history any time you want. Also, check out my article on how to view your Google Maps search history. Enjoy!

So imagine the chagrin of the hardcore Android fans when they found out that Nougat factory images for the Nexus 6 were none to be had. The few Nexus 9 (LTE) users in the world also raised up a feeble shout saying the same thing. While the reasons for delay are still nebulous, Google has somehow promised that the update should be coming in the next few weeks. The numerous delays and lack of factory images for certain Nexus devices had almost driven their owners to the point of hopelessness, giving up and saying that there really might not be a Nougat update for their devices. Well, this is not true, according to the mothership. So rejoice, you Nexus 6 and Nexus 9 LTE users. Google has made it known that the rollout of Nougat for these devices will begin in a few weeks. That does not seem like a long wait for you guys, so hold on. The reasons for the delay are still unknown, but our guess is that this is the result of Google still ironing out some things so that Nougat can run smoothly on older hardware. So there you go. Hold on for a few more weeks, and soon your Nexus 6 and Nexus 9 LTE will finally get an official taste of Android Nougat.

The company didn’t set a timeline for this goal, but says it defines zero waste to landfill as diverting 100 percent “to a more sustainable pathway with no more than 10 percent of it going to a waste-to-energy facility, unless waste-to-energy can be proved more valuable than alternative diversion paths.” Google’s waste management approach is based on UL Environment’s zero waste to landfill standard. The tech giant says it partnered with UL Environment to develop and monitor its zero waste goal. In a blog announcing Google’s “Moonshot to Zero,” Jim Miller, vice president of global operations, says six of Google’s 14 data centers have achieved 100 percent landfill diversion. In addition to reducing waste, applying circular economy approaches to its server management has saved the company million of dollars in materials, Miller writes. “We…have evidence that we don’t need to sacrifice one shade of green for another.” Globally, the company’s data center operations divert at least 86 percent of waste, writes Rachel Futrell, technical program manager, data center sustainability, in a different blog. The company says it plans to achieve 100 percent waste diversion by first looking to reuse its equipment and materials before buying new. If it can’t be reused, Google erases the data and then resells the equipment. “In 2015, 52 percent of components used for machine upgrades were refurbished inventory and Google resold nearly 2 million units into the secondary market for reuse by other organizations,” Miller writes. The remaining hardware that can’t be reused or resold is recycled. Google is also targeting other waste streams. In the San Francisco Bay Area, for example, the company has achieved an 86 percent diversion rate in part by large-scale composting and using a software system called LeanPath that tracks food waste.

Sometimes, these U-turns work out well in the end. Other times, they're baffling and frustrating for us as users. And other times yet, they're so subtle and evolutionary -- more of broad philosophical shifts than surface-level alterations -- that you almost don't even notice them until you really stop and think. This latest instance falls into that final category. I'm talking about the apparent move back toward out-of-sight, difficult-to-discover actions in the operating system -- something Google explicitly made an effort to avoid starting with 2011's Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich release. With this year's Android 7.0 Nougat software, the regression has become enough of a trend to make me worry. Out of sight, out of mind First, a quick step back in time for perspective: Much of Google's focus with Android 4.0 was on making the operating system more polished, intuitive, and user-friendly. (Astute observers may remember that Ice Cream Sandwich was the first release fully guided by then-new-Android-design-chief Matias Duarte, who joined Google midway through Honeycomb's development and has since moved onto a broader role overseeing Material Design across all of Google's products.) A large part of that effort involved taking the platform's many hidden elements and bringing them out into the open. That way, they'd be more visible and thus more likely to be discovered and used. It was that goal that led to the elimination of Android's system-level Menu key, which had caused commands to be tucked away off the screen -- with no indication of their presence. Having elements of the interface hidden, Google realized, did not make for an ideal user experience; without any visual cues, such elements were difficult for people to discover and unnatural for them to use. I don't know if something changed or if that lesson was simply deprioritized over time, but Android has been inching increasingly back into the realm of buried commands as of late. The slideback actually started with 2013's Android 4.4 KitKat release -- albeit in a relatively small way: With Android 4.0, as you may recall, Google moved the option to add home screen widgets from a hidden long-press menu into the main app drawer, where it'd be plainly in sight and accessible. The idea was to create a single place for finding everything that could be added onto your home screen. From a discoverability and usability perspective, it seemed to make an awful lot of sense. But then, without explanation, KitKat did an about-face: The release quietly pulled widgets out of the app drawer and put them back into their former long-press-menu hiding spot. Out of sight once again -- and that was just the start. There's a lot of good stuff in Android that people aren't even aware exists 2012's Android 4.1 release introduced Google Now, which made the hidden long-press command a core part of Android's user interface. Last year's Android 6.0 Marshmallow software took things a step further and brought the also-cue-lacking Now On Tap into the equation. (Even I constantly forget it's there, and I pay attention to this stuff for a living.) And with this year's Android 7.0 Nougat update, a whole host of similarly concealed commands has been added into the mix -- things like long-pressing the Overview key (or, more inconspicuous yet, tapping it and then long-pressing an app's card from there) to initiate split-screen mode; long-pressing notifications to customize their behavior; and long-pressing icons in the Share list to change the order in which they appear. All of these commands are significant additions to the operating system and have the potential to be quite useful -- and all of them are equally out of sight and difficult to discover. I was reminded of this when I asked my wife, who has a reasonably good grasp on technology but is much more of a "normal user" than an enthusiast, what she thought about the new Nougat software that arrived on her Nexus 5X earlier this week. Her answer? "It's fine, I guess. I haven't really noticed anything different. I know there's that split-screen thing you showed me, but I haven't figured out how to do it yet." And remember: She's someone who has the advantage of at least hearing about these things (via my incessant blabbing) and knowing that they're there. Most typical users are going into this completely blind. And that's precisely the type of situation where a lack of intuitiveness really becomes an issue. An important nit to pick Don't get me wrong: At this point, Android is pretty, polished, and packed with power. But increasingly, a fair portion of that power is out of sight and thus out of mind to users -- particularly the more common casual users who don't carefully follow the platform's development. And that's a shame, because there's a lot of good stuff here that regular people aren't even aware exists. Part of it may just be that as the platform expands, the software inevitably grows more dense with features and options -- and Google's running out of obvious places to squeeze all of that within the current Android framework. (There are only so many places for top-level buttons and commands, after all.) Maybe the answer, then, is something that requires more sweeping changes to the operating system's interface -- something that allows these features to be incorporated in an intuitive and visible way rather than being crammed awkwardly into a corner. One way or another, I hope Google regains its focus on maintaining a simple and visual-guided UI for Android before the complexity seeps in much further. It took the company years to transform Android from a power-user-centric mishmosh of possibilities into an intuitive and inviting (though no less powerful) platform for the masses. If these current trends continue, it'll take far less time for all of that progress to be undone.

(Photo: Jefferson Graham for USA TODAY) SAN FRANCISCO —  They have years of experience and plenty of talent — and they can't land a job. People over the age of 40 or worse, 50, are often persona non grata in Silicon Valley's youth culture, where executives are upfront about their hiring preference for engineers fresh out of college. Called "one of the most ageist places in America," Silicon Valley can't hide the pervasive lack of gray hair and wrinkles in its workforce. The median age of an American worker is 42. At Facebook it's 29, Google 30, Apple 31, Amazon 30 and Microsoft 33, according to research firm PayScale. And that is starting to get some of the major tech companies into trouble.  Google and Hewlett-Packard have recently been hit by lawsuits alleging age discrimination. There's speculation that the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has started to investigate. (The EEOC declined comment.) Silicon Valley's 150 largest tech companies were sued 226 times for age bias from 2008 through 2015, according to a recent Bloomberg report, citing data from the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing. The report did not indicate if age-discrimination is on the rise, but said such complaints were 28% higher than those of racial bias and 9% more than gender bias in the same 8-year stretch. Tech companies now release numbers about race and gender, which have shown them to be predominantly staffed by white and Asian men, with few women and underrepresented minorities in leadership positions. But they haven't disclosed age. As the population ages, discrimination in hiring and on the job is becoming a more frequent topic of conversation among a growing number of Silicon Valley workers who are staring at their own expiration date. Dan Lyons, a journalist in his 50s who wrote about his experience at a technology start-up in his new book Disrupted: My Misadventure in the Start-Up Bubble, put it this way: "I saw a place where 'old people' — those over 40 and certainly over 50 — were largely unwanted." Gerard Corbett, a former executive at Hitachi, says after 1,000 job applications he's yet to land a full time job. He blames Silicon Valley's unstated bias against older workers.  (Photo: Gerard Corbett for USA TODAY) Take Gerard Francis Corbett, 66, of San Bruno, Calif.,  who has fruitlessly sought a full-time job in tech for nearly a decade. "The sweet spot for hiring is between 25 and 40; if you fall out of that range, you’re toast," Corbett told me. "I've heard nothing in two years. Headhunters tell me I'm not in the target demographic." Since he was let go by Hitachi America when it shuttered its consumer-electronics business in 2007, Corbett has applied for 1,000 jobs but has only landed a handful of interviews — all by phone. “I’m the poster boy for age discrimination,” says Corbett, the former vice president of branding and corporate communications at Hitachi. He's coaching and consulting as he looks for full-time jobs. Think of it as a modern-day version of Logan's Run, a sci-fi movie about a futuristic society in which life ends at 30. That mindset was underscored in 2007, when Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, then 22, told an audience at Stanford University, “Younger people are just smarter ... Why are most chess masters under 30?" Women over a certain age are hit with a double whammy. Tatyana Kanzaveli, CEO and founder of Open Health Network, in Los Altos, Calif., says she has been trying unsuccessfully to get funding for her 3-year-old mobile health platform. “My start-up can’t get funding because I am female and over 40,” she says. “My start-up has amazing big-name customers, like American Heart Association and McGill University, and yet VCs tell me it's not the right fit for them. Four former employees last month sued Hewlett Packard in a proposed class-action suit, alleging they were purged unfairly as part of a major restructuring involving tens of thousands of layoffs. Cheryl Fillekes, 47, a systems engineer who interviewed with Google but was not hired, is part of an age-discrimination lawsuit against the company in federal court in San Jose. (HP and Google deny the plaintiffs' charges and have vowed to defend themselves in court.) USA TODAY HP hit with age-discrimination lawsuit by four ex-employees The situation is unfortunate — and ironic in the case of Apple, Microsoft, Oracle and others — since their heydays occurred while CEOs Steve Jobs, Bill Gates and Larry Ellison were in their 40s and older. Today, a large percentage of in-house recruiters are unwilling to “look at someone with more than 20 years of experience," laments Jolie Downs, a marketing and communications recruiter in the San Francisco Bay Area. "It's something we discuss in meetings often: How to get clients to open their mind to this incredibly talented candidate pool." I can relate. At Apple's iPhone 7 event last week, I felt — at age 55 — like a dinosaur. A vast majority of the crowd there was at least a decade younger. That was typical of tech events and the frequent industry hangouts, where anyone over 35 may feel left out. Innovation isn't defined by age. Consider Winston Churchill, Julia Child, Paul Simon, Clint Eastwood, Meryl Streep, Charles Darwin or anyone else who produced greatness after age 50. "Experience should be valued, and we get blocked out of the entrepreneurial space," Kanzaveli says. "Being in a field for years should be considered. It's not just about picking the smartest people out of college."

And now it's going after...Apigee? On Thursday, Google said it's buying the software maker for $625 million. It's hardly a blockbuster purchase, but it's large enough to stand out for Google, which doesn't often make acquisitions of much size. The internet search giant has announced only 23 takeovers with publicly disclosed price tags of more than $100 million. The Apigee deal is the largest since Google acquired Nest Labs in 2014 for $3.2 billion. Some Here, Some There Google's parent Alphabet has heaps of cash, but isn't known for spending a lot of it on big deals. Source: Bloomberg Why Google had this particular company in its sights may have some shareholders scratching their heads (shares of Google's parent Alphabet fell in early trading). Apigee has struggled financially since it went public. Its track record of unprofitability stands out even among a group of money-losing North American software peers, with operating and Ebitda margins well below the low bar that serves as a median for that contingency. It lags behind the pack by other measures as well: But Apigee is in a hot -- if dull -- corner of technology. The company focuses on APIs, essentially software middlemen that coordinate what's happening on, for example, a mobile-banking app with the bank's back-end computer systems. APIs are essential components for most activities in the contemporary digital world, and while Apigee's revenue is small at less than $100 million, it is growing quickly. That said, API is already a crowded area with traditional tech players such as IBM and Oracle involved, as well as a host of upstarts including 2016 IPO darling Twilio. It's difficult to assess if Apigee has some magic technology that is absent at Google, a company that is darn good at APIs in its own right. Above all, the deal shows that Google is willing to open its wallet to help its cloud business, a renewed focus (maybe) for Google under new boss Diane Greene. She and Google have made a lot of noise about how they want to challenge and exceed industry leader Amazon Web Services, but so far the number of press clippings about Google's cloud operation probably exceed the business's actual revenue. U-Turn Apigee went public for $17 a share. Google is paying about $17.40. What goes around, comes around? Source: Bloomberg Google is offering a paltry-looking 6.5 percent premium to Apigee's stock price on Wednesday. However, shares of the target had run up some 44 percent since June as takeover speculation heated up. Interestingly, Google's bid gives Apigee shareholders the chance to cash out at roughly the same price at which the company went public less than 18 months ago. Not a bad deal considering analysts were running out of reasons for Apigee to continue rising on its own. Even so, shares of Apigee traded above Google's takeover price for much of Thursday morning, suggesting at least some traders are wagering on a higher offer. Google is already valuing Apigee at about 7 times its trailing 12-month revenue, roughly double the median for software takeovers of size in the last year. But if the strategic value is enough that Google has deigned to bid on the company, rivals may not worry too much about the mathematics. --Rani Molla contributed graphics to this article.

Google Is Making It Easier To View Emails On Smartphones International Business Times 9/15/2016 Ken Manbert Salcedo © Provided by IBT US Google has announced that it will be updating its Gmail and Inbox by Gmail apps later this month. The new versions of the company’s email apps will soon come with a design that would enable content to adapt to smartphones regardless of screen size. “Starting later this month, Gmail and Inbox by Gmail will support emails created with responsive design, meaning their content adapts to fit screens of all sizes,” Google said on its official Gmail blog. “Texts, links, and even buttons will enlarge to make reading and tapping easier on a smaller screen.” © Photo: Google Responsive design for emails shown for the Inbox by Google app.   Viewing emails on smartphones can sometimes be a headache. There are times when texts are just too small to read and links are harder to tap. This is because emails are still formatted to be viewed on larger computer screens. Popular Searches Lowe's Companies Inc LOW ▼ 67.27 -1.78 -2.58% Amazon.com Inc AMZN ▲ 744.26 +1.02 +0.14% Cisco Systems Inc CSCO ▼ 31.57 -0.13 -0.41% Target Corp TGT ▲ 75.96 +4.52 +6.33% Google’s update for Gmail and Inbox is intended to resolve these issues by enabling all of its emails to adapt to all types of screen sizes. When this update rolls out, emails should automatically be formatted to fit exactly on the user’s smartphone screen, and users won’t have to zoom in or out to read texts or to tap on any buttons or links. This new responsive design for emails is also the same on how people view content on desktop/laptop computers. For example, changing the size of a browser’s window will prompt the webpage to automatically adjust the format of the page to make it more comfortable for people to view content. Google isn’t only bring improvements to its email apps as the company has promised to bring the some improvements to desktop versions. After all, emails formatted for mobile already look better on computers. Although Google is making an effort to make sure emails are easier to view on mobile devices, this update won’t affect all emails, as pointed out by The Next Web. The new responsive design will only apply to emails that look like small webpages (i.e. website newsletters).

MSPU Windows Phone Windows 10 Surface Xbox Enterprise Tip us Settings Text Input: Windows 10 Windows Phone Surface Xbox Enterprise Settings Tip us Forum Text Input: Microsoft’s Edge browser still beats Google’s improved Chrome in battery tests 0 by Michael Allison  @Mkeallison Sep 15, 2016 at 14:08 GMT2 months ago Microsoft and Google are in a war to provide the best battery life for your portable computer – and the only winners here are consumers. Earlier this year, Microsoft released a video showing their improvements their Edge browser had with regards to battery life over other browsers like Google’s Chrome, Mozilla’s Firefox and Opera’s browser. In response to that, Google released Chrome 53, introducing a new material design interface and more importantly, adding battery life improvements for Windows 10 users. Were those changes enough to edge Chrome ahead in the battery life department? Not quite. According to Microsoft’s tests carried out on Edge in the Windows 10 Anniversary Update and Chrome 53, Edge still holds the battery life crown in the Windows 10 Anniversary Update. The Microsoft Windows team measured the average power consumption of the CPU, GPU, and Wifi antenna while Microsoft Edge, Chrome, Firefox, and Opera ran a complex yet representative set of user activities. These tests were done on three Surface Books running Windows 10 Anniversary Update (build 14393.105) and connected to the Internet through Wifi. Actual power consumption of the CPU, GPU, and Wifi antenna were measured using onboard Maxim chips, and read through Performance Monitor (Perfmon). Microsoft tested the latest versions of Edge, Firefox, Chrome and Opera in a series of tests that mimicked “real world” usage of these devices. Just like the tests carried out before, Edge came out ahead, offering up to 43% more battery life in typical web browsing activities. Of course, Microsoft’s Edge team also used Google’s earlier benchmark test where they looped a video over and over in Vimeo to showcase Chrome 53’s improvements on a SurfaceBook to demonstrate what while Chrome was indeed more efficient than previous versions, Edge still lasted for more than 90 minutes than Chrome did (91 minutes? 100 minutes? ) It’s clear that Microsoft still holds the power consumption crown on Windows, Edge still isn’t the browser of choice for many people for various reasons, rxtension support still isn’t as widespread as Chrome is, Edge is sometimes flaky on certain devices and sometimes even consumes more RAM than it should when left in the background. Personally, I have found that Edge still freezes more than Chrome- which despite the higher power consumption still has an “it just works” quality around it that Edge doesn’t have just yet. Regardless of whether Edge or Chrome is your browser of choice, both companies now have a vested interest in making sure their browser is better than the other, either on arbitrary bullet points, or meaningful statistics like battery usage, or RAM management. No matter who “wins”, we – as consumers and customers- all benefit. Some links in the article may not be viewable as you are using an AdBlocker.

News Stocks Technology Science Health Politics World Videos The Tape Latest Follow WSP Newsletter RSS Facebook Twitter Google+ Search for: HomeConsumerNew Copyright Rules Could Benefit Amazon and Netflix (AMZN) (NFLX) New Copyright Rules Could Benefit Amazon and Netflix (AMZN) (NFLX) EU’s proposed copyright regulations could reduce the value of selected Facebook and Google services. September 15, 2016 WSP It appears that the European Union is proposing a set of copyright rules that could be mildly troublesome for Google-parent Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Facebook Inc (NASDAQ:FB). Although the revenue impact from these rules seems limited, the proposed copyright regulations could diminish the value of Google and Facebook’s services. On the other hand, the same rules could be beneficial for online video service providers like Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) as the new rules could enable them to offer better services in EU countries. One of the “three main priorities” outlined in the EU’s proposal, and the one that’s nettlesome to Facebook and Google, is the plan to “a fairer and sustainable marketplace for creators and press.” These rules include ensuring that audio and video content owners are compensated once their works are used on “video-sharing platforms such as [Google’s] YouTube or DailyMotion.” Another part of the proposal includes a new related right for press publishers, which require companies to provide compensation for newspaper and magazines. Video sites – such as YouTube and DailyMotion – provide audio/video copyright holders with tools to let them decide how their materials can be used in the uploaded videos. And with every allowed material, the sites have a cut on ad revenues. Unsurprisingly, Google, Facebook, and other companies are contesting the proposal, arguing that providing excerpts and links for copyrighted material on their platforms is perfectly legal and the U.S. courts have agreed that the practice is on fair-use grounds. But in Europe, the courts and lawmakers are siding with publishers. In fact, Spain announced a “Google tax” in 2014, requiring the search engine giant to pay publishers for using their material. In response, Google shut down its Spanish version of Google News. To appease continental publishers, Google gave publishers $163 million to fund their digital efforts over a course of 3 years via its Digital News Initiative. The search engine giant also set up a $82 million fund to pay French publishers. Google slammed EU’s copyright proposal, arguing that it would “effectively turn the internet into a place where everything uploaded to the web must be cleared by lawyers before it can find an audience.” It also declares the rules could hurt publisher traffic, and that “paying to display snippets is not a viable option for anyone.” As to how the new measures could prove beneficial for Amazon, the e-commerce giant is heavily invested in its European Prime Video offerings. The EU is calling member countries to “set up negotiation bodies to help reach licensing deals, including those for cross-border services,” for video-on-demand (VOD) platforms like Netflix. This could lead to licensing deals with studios that cater to many EU markets, lower total licensing costs and provide easier content streaming for customers visiting other countries. The proposal came just as Netflix announced a deal with European pay-TV provider Liberty Global (NASDAQ:LBTYA). The deal enables Netflix app to be installed on Liberty set-top boxes. The European pay TV provider boasts of 29 million subscribers in 30 countries.

Amy Gesenhues on September 15, 2016 at 8:55 am More In case there is anyone out there in search of more election news, Google has added a new tool to its set of voting features with the launch of the Google Trends Election Hub. Offering a deep dive into this year’s election-related search trends across the US, Google’s new site features real-time reports on president and vice president candidate search queries, in addition to search data around political issues by state and county. The home page for the Google Election Trends Hub has links to each of the presidential candidates to see search trends by state along with a list of related queries. The hub’s home page also has a chart graphing national search interest in each candidate over the previous week, as well as links to daily state-by-state search interests, voter registration searches and the top election issue-related searches by state during the past week. There are also charts graphing the number of “Vote for [presidential candidate]” searches during the past week, and searches for “how to vote,” which Google reports is at its highest rate ever. The Google Election Hub includes county-level data — a first for Google: “For instance, while the economy is the most searched issue on average across the swing state of Florida, immigration is more searched in southern counties in the state.” Google has added a YouTube election map to show how many people are watching Clinton videos versus Trump videos by state. According to Google, this year’s election related searches are up 240 percent over this time preceding 2012’s Election Day.

These are just a few of the “major” Google announcements made over the past year that caused big reactions across the search industry. Analysts, myself included, have been scrambling to report on how these updates are impacting brands and to come up with best practices in light of the results. Analyzing the paid search landscape, however, I find that it’s often the silent, unannounced updates that have the largest impact on performance. Of course, all paid search managers would love to think that the success or failure of their programs hinges on their hard work and brilliant strategies, but sometimes the most significant factors happen behind the scenes. That’s not to say that there aren’t smarter ways than others to respond to these unannounced developments, and it can pay to be able to figure out they’re happening in the first place. To illustrate my point, I’ll discuss a few recent updates that have received a lot of coverage and a few that are less well publicized, then explain how each update stands to impact performance. Well-known but less impactful updates Expanded text ads Google’s new expanded text ad (ETA) format offers significantly more characters for advertisers to work with and was touted by Google itself as increasing click-through rate (CTR) by 2X for some advertisers. I wrote extensively on the early performance comparisons between ETA and older text ads here a month ago, explaining that when the data is segmented properly, non-brand ads at the top of the page see almost no difference in performance. ETAs for brand terms at the top of the page actually had slightly lower CTR than the older ad format. ETAs at the bottom of the page do appear to be outperforming standard text ads in CTR, but the bottom of the page only accounts for about 20 percent of all non-brand clicks, according to our data at Merkle. This means the overall impact on account performance from a better CTR in this page location is slight. I explained in my prior post why it’s likely that some case studies that have been published show much better results with ETA, and you should go read that if you’re interested in understanding more about how ETAs are really performing. To the point of this post, our outlook is that ETAs will likely have a much smaller impact on ad spend than the reactions it has garnered might indicate. Customer Match Hailed as the beginning of futuristic search targeting, Customer Match provides advertisers the ability to create audiences out of email lists in order to adjust bidding and messaging for those users when they search. Using information about users in Customer Match audiences, such as past order history, advertisers would then be able to “personalize” the ad experience in order to drive greater value out of paid search. Across Merkle advertisers actively deploying Customer Match audiences, only about two percent of Google search spend is being attributed to them, largely due to the limited share of emails Google can match to searchers and the restriction that all emails used in these audiences must be obtained firsthand by each advertiser. The share of orders is higher (as these users are typically very high-value and more likely than an average searcher to convert), but still small. There are certainly possibilities on the horizon that could help to increase spend and order share, some of which I’ll be speaking to in an upcoming SMX East session devoted entirely to Customer Match. However, the current reality and short-term outlook is that while Customer Match does allow for some unique targeting options in crafting catered experiences to users that a brand has interacted with previously, it’s not able to reach a large share of searchers in general. Tablet bidding controls Google recently announced that advertisers will be able to set bids for desktop and tablet devices separately, eliminating one of the more annoying aspects of Enhanced Campaigns to date. I myself was pretty pumped for the update. I can’t deny that. But digging into what the real impact on ad spend will be, it’s likely pretty small. While most advertisers will likely quickly move to bid tablets down relative to desktop due to lower conversion rates on tablets (tablet revenue per click was 30 percent lower than that of desktop for Merkle advertisers in Q2), tablet paid search traffic share is declining. In fact, it’s been declining for the past several quarters, and was down to 14 percent in Q2 2016, compared to its high point of 18 percent in Q1 of 2015. Sales numbers verify the waning popularity of tablet devices, and as smartphones get larger and more sophisticated, it is possible tablets continue to shrink as a share of paid search traffic. At present, decreasing tablet devices in a vacuum by 30 percent in and of itself has the potential to decrease total paid search investment by perhaps four percentage points for our advertisers, with that impact becoming smaller if tablets continue to decline in importance. However, decreases in tablet bids should accompany increases in desktop bids, as the value of desktop traffic should warrant higher bids than the combined value of desktop and tablet traffic. If all desktop bids increased properly, given the relative revenue per click of desktop versus tablet we observe for our advertisers, this has the potential to result in about a three- to four-percentage point bump in total paid search spend taken in a vacuum. And assuming that most advertisers will move similarly to take advantage of the new bidding controls, the overall competitive landscape on these devices shouldn’t shift too much. The overall difference in spend, then, is likely to be pretty small. There are, of course, industries in which advertisers might see better performance on tablets, such as gaming apps. But again, it’s likely that all of the players in these industries will react similarly to the changes, and the bid adjustments made to desktop and tablet will impact spend on these device types in opposing ways much like for advertisers that see worse performance with tablets. More than anything, the device split feels like a moral victory for advertisers who have been clamoring for these controls since the beginning of Enhanced Campaigns. Google waited until tablets were on the decline to hand over control, however, and the overall impact could be pretty small. Important changes that haven’t been well publicized Google adds third (and fourth) text ad on phones In mid-2015, Google silently released a third text ad above the organic links on phones, formally admitting to the change in late August after a post of mine reported on the impact of the change. The third text ad has been a significant driver of paid search spend growth ever since. One year after the addition of the third text ad, Google moved to add a fourth text ad to some queries, again with no formal announcement and also no real confirmation. This has significantly driven up the share of phone traffic coming from the fourth ad position on phones, from close to zero in early June to about three percent now. The third text ad increased the maximum number of text ads above organic links on phones by 50 percent. The fourth text ad increased it by 33 percent. As such, it’s no wonder why organic traffic growth on phones has been in decline over the past year. Google rapidly expands Product Listing Ad (PLA) impressions on google.com The graph below features the change in Google Shopping impressions relative to January 2015 over the past 19 months. As you can see, Merkle advertisers saw more Google Shopping/PLA impressions in Q1 of 2016 than they did during the busy holiday season of 2015 (by far the busiest season for the vast majority of our advertisers). Looking at a Y/Y comparison, January 2016 saw 202 percent more phone PLA impressions than January 2015. Further, PLA impressions have continued to increase throughout 2016, particularly on phones. In turn, PLA spend growth on phones has been rather incredible, with a Y/Y increase of 135 percent in Q2 for Merkle retailers. No formal announcements explain these trends, and this is just for Google.com. Quiet expansion of the PLA search partner network PLA search partner traffic share has exploded over the past few quarters, and it now accounts for 14 percent of all desktop PLA traffic. This rise can be attributed to a few changes. One is Google’s move in December of last year to begin showing PLAs in Google image search, a move which Google only formally announced six months later. Another is Yahoo’s apparent shift to increasingly showing Google PLAs in its results, as opposed to Bing Ads or Gemini Product Ads. The rekindling of the Yahoo–Google relationship was formally announced last October, and Yahoo has spoken of their efforts to choose the best ads from AdWords, Bing Ads and Gemini in recent quarterly earnings calls. Still, the expansion of Google PLAs on Yahoo.com seems to be garnering little attention from many in the SEM industry. Conclusion In the case of two-sided businesses like Google that have to serve not only the public but also advertisers, it can be necessary to be very vocal about some updates, while offering no public acknowledgment whatsoever of others. In most circumstances where they remain mum, I imagine Google’s reasoning usually has to do with there being no obvious positive outcome of a formal announcement. Judging by how the search industry reacts to the announcements that are publicly made, we tend to jump on Google’s statements with a pretty critical spotlight, so it’s not shocking that they’d want to avoid controversy when possible. Not every decision can make every party happy. However, Google’s silent updates have been steadily impacting our advertisers’ performance far more than the most publicized changes.

SUBSCRIBE Google: Search the primary and most often used mobile shopping tool Survey says nearly 90 percent of mobile consumers turn to search first. Greg Sterling on September 15, 2016 at 9:28 am More George Dolgikh / Shutterstock.com Google has quite successfully pivoted toward mobile over the past few years. And while more searches now happen on mobile devices, it has been hotly debated whether search plays as central a role for mobile consumers as it does for desktop users. Earlier this week, Google released survey data that asserts search has indeed become a primary resource for smartphone owners. In addition, it’s the most frequently used shopping tool for mobile consumers, according to the findings. Earlier this year, Google polled 1,000 smartphone users “several times a day for a week” (throughout the day) to understand their mobile activities and behaviors. The company says it collected more than 14,000 responses in the process. Here’s the major finding: “Not only is search the most used [mobile] resource, it’s the resource 87 percent of people turn to first.” The chart below reflects the hierarchy of tools and resources mobile consumers utilized to fulfill their shopping needs. Source: Google/Purchased Digital Diary, “How Consumers Solve Their Needs in the Moment,” n=1,000 smartphone users, May 2016. According to the survey, 70 percent of in-store buyers used their mobile devices for research before purchase. In particular, mobile search usage lead to transactions: “92 percent of those who searched on their phone made a related purchase.” The actions that “most commonly preceded a purchase” (among a range of categories) were “used a search engine” and “visited a store location” in equal measure. Google also made the point that mobile devices are used throughout the purchase cycle — not just immediately before purchase — and often for what might be described as “top of funnel” behavior: While search has long been useful to help with quick tasks like looking up a dinner recipe, it’s also widely used to make progress on long-term projects. In fact, 68 percent of people used search to help with things they want to address at some point in the future, the highest of any other online or offline source. And those searches for future needs largely happen on mobile with 97 percent of people searching on a mobile phone to do so. Recently released data from Thrive Analytics reinforce this point and show that mobile devices are widely used for general research early in the purchase process. Searching for “general information” while “at home” was the most common use case for mobile devices in the Thrive study. I don’t question the veracity of the findings. However, I do believe that this research carries an “agenda.” Google is by implication trying to combat the widespread perception that social is the dominant mobile use case and that search is a kind of secondary tool — at least when it comes to shopping.

clock menu more-arrow Who will buy Twitter? We ranked all the possible buyers. So glad you asked. by Kurt Wagner and Kara Swisher Sep 14, 2016, 4:37pm EDT Image credit: Recode tweet share Linkedin Twitter's board is leaning toward making a sale with possible suitors including Google and Salesforce, amongst other tech companies, as CNBC's David Faber reported Sept. 23. The stock was up as much as 20 percent after the report. The following story, which ran Sept. 14, breaks down all the likely (and unlikely) buyers and why. At pretty much every recent dinner party, tech gathering and social shindig where we have run into the digital elite, everyone seems to have the same question: What's going to happen to Twitter? The travails of the San Francisco-based social communications company have been an ongoing soap opera for a long time now, one that has gotten Google-sized attention despite its relatively small size and tech impact. Like the slow-moving train wreck of Yahoo, to which Twitter is increasingly compared, it’s partly due to the media fascination with the company. And there is no doubt that the app’s social impact is immeasurable, especially in the way it holds a perpetual mirror in front of all the narcissists in the world (Trump! Kanye! Various and sundry VCs on Sand Hill Road!). Or, as former Twitter board member Mike McCue told us recently: "Twitter is a huge phenomenon more than it is a company." Ouch. Here’s the case for and against all the possible Twitter suitors that keep cropping up. But perhaps that's the truth, even as CEO Jack Dorsey and his top execs seek to bring growth and value back to the company he founded. It raises the question: What is going to happen to Twitter? At a projected $18 billion price tag, the options can be tough to imagine. Luckily, we did all the hard work for you! There is a caveat: So far, the company’s top brass has not wanted to sell and has indicated that the hope is to remain independent. But because it’s Twitter, that did not stop Dorsey’s co-founder and director Evan Williams from setting off a ruckus after he was asked about a possible sale. Williams no-commented and then noted that the board would "consider the right options." No surprise, the non-answer caused the stock to pop. It’s down again, though, and the question now becomes whether anyone thinks there are actual buyers for the company. As one former exec there told us recently, sotto voce: "Twitter is the most invaluable company that no one really wants to buy." Double ouch. That’s not exactly true, which is why we put on our green-shade visors and did some investment banking of our own. While we may lack the gumption of the ever-wily Frank Quattrone, we make up for it in energetic guessing, larded with a lot of actual reporting. So here’s the case for and against all the possible Twitter suitors that keep cropping up. Google Justin Sullivan / Getty The case for Google (Kurt): There’s a good reason Google’s name always tops this list: It makes the most sense! Google has the money — Alphabet generated more revenue last quarter alone ($21 billion) than Twitter is actually worth. And while the company has tried its hand at social media before (I think we can all now agree that Google+ has been a minus), Twitter would give it a legitimate social platform to tie in with YouTube, which is now feeling heat from Facebook and Snapchat, which are very social. Could Google make good use of Twitter properties like Vine and Periscope by coupling them in some kind of media hybrid offering with YouTube? Maybe! Look how happy they are! Michael Kovac/Getty Images for Vanity Fair Google already understands the advertising business, so no problems there. Then imagine Twitter’s livestreaming pitch to the NFL and other major rights holders with Google’s backing on distribution. Google could essentially bring Twitter private, and allow it to fix whatever user and product problems it has away from the investor criticism that comes when you’re a public company. There’s a lot to like here. Haters like to point out that Alphabet CEO Larry Page doesn’t give a rip about social media, but he’s no longer running Google. Sundar Pichai is. Couple that with former Google exec Omid Kordestani now chairing Twitter’s board, and the whole Larry hates social argument may no longer mean much. The case against Google (Kara): Kurt, Kurt, Kurt. Larry no longer runs Google? When pigs fly perhaps, but today making a nearly $20 billion purchase is something the testy and robotic founder will most definitely need to weigh in on. And he does have disdain for social, for reasons that include the fact that no one at Google is social or understands the paradigm. But Google lost to Facebook a long time ago on that score, and Page seems to have decided that the company’s future is not in this direction. Rather, his recent hire of Diane Greene to compete with Amazon and others in the cloud and his artificial intelligence plays are the kind of all-in investments that make the most sense. And then there are the regulatory issues that come with any big Google purchase. Will the politicians in D.C. like Google owning all of search and the still-influential social platform upon which the recent election has been playing out? No, they will not. Ask the first Twitter presidential candidate, Donald Trump, if he’d like the Democratic-leaning Google to own his fave platform and he would blow a very large raspberry on the podium. Vanity aside, it’s not an acquisition that even the roll-over regulators of the various U.S. agencies will swallow easily. As for the hair-trigger Europeans? Nein! Non! Or, as persistent Google foe and European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager would surely declare: Ingen! Hand in glove with the many antitrust issues, there is the mass of publicity that comes with owning Twitter. It is watched by the media like no other company (largely because reporters love to talk about nothing more than themselves, even if no one else cares). While Google gets a lot of attention, the kind that Twitter gets is not the same and not welcome to the secretive nature of the search giant. And then there are the ugly controversies around abuse. While Google perhaps has the tech chops to help improve the tools to fix the ongoing debacle in this arena, it would take a massive PR effort that is simply not in the company’s wheelhouse. Google is all about the algorithm and Twitter is all about humanity. You see the disconnect here. Perhaps most simply, Google already has Twitter on its platform via search. Whether it needs more than that for that much money is a very good question. Facebook The case for Facebook (Kurt): Facebook does a lot of things really well. One of those things is selling and delivering mobile advertising, which, coincidentally, is how Twitter makes money. Facebook is also great at user growth — it has three separate billion-user products, plus Instagram, which has more than 500 million users. Twitter has been stuck right around 300 million monthly users for over a year and needs a serious distribution jolt. Facebook also does a lot of things well that Twitter wants to do, like video distribution and messaging. What Facebook doesn’t do well is what Twitter does best: Distributing breaking and real-time news. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg talked a lot on the company’s last earnings call about live video and immediacy around the news, but Facebook hasn’t figured it out, as evidenced by its trending topics nightmare that doesn’t seem to go away. Buying Twitter could help solve that problem and, at the very least, ensure the company doesn’t fall into a competitor’s hands (see: Google). The case against Facebook (Kara): Yes, the real-time news argument is a good one. But is solving it worth a $20 billion check? Or could Facebook just use the same tactics as it has in its complete lift of Snapchat Stories using its Instagram unit? It would be much harder, obviously, as replicating Twitter as a global news platform is not the same as copying hot software. But it is certain that Facebook probably has a lot of cheaper innovations to beating Twitter at news than the trouble it might buy with Twitter. Most central to that trouble is all the grief that would come with Twitter’s massive basket of deplorables. And we do mean deplorables here, and we’re not apologizing for saying so, because it is a cesspool of abuse and ugliness far too often. All those anonymous users spewing all that hatred is most definitely not amenable to Facebook’s walled-garden approach to social, which has been a huge success for it. And Facebook itself has been pretty bad about dealing with similar controversies over what it bans (see the recent mistake over the "napalm girl" photo). More complexity seems to be something that the company is incapable of dealing with, even if it introduces better tools. And as good as they are, neither Zuckerberg nor COO Sheryl Sandberg are equipped to handle the mass of controversy that Twitter brings with it. Plus, as with Google, there would be regulatory issues that would be tough to overcome. (Sorry, Elliot Schrage — you’re good, but not that good!) Facebook tried to buy Twitter a long time ago for $500 million. That was then. Microsoft Justin Sullivan / Getty The case for Microsoft (Kara): There is no real case, because what kind of problem does Twitter solve for Microsoft? None! The company is turning very clearly into an enterprise company, after many — so many — debacles in the consumer space. But okay, I’ll try. It would be nice for Microsoft to have some traction in social, in mobile and in ads. Maybe Twitter could be integrated in with LinkedIn, for which the software giant recently paid $26 billion, bringing in a savvy media-focused exec in its CEO Jeff Weiner. He’d surely have some ideas for it. But that’s all I got. The case against Microsoft (Kurt): Kara pretty much nailed it up top. Microsoft already broke the bank this year for an unprofitable social network in LinkedIn, so buying another one would be foolish. Microsoft hasn’t hit any home runs with other social and communication acquisitions, such as Yammer and Skype (does anyone actually use Skype on mobile?), and there’s nothing here to imply a Microsoft-owned Twitter would be any different. Plus, if Twitter is serious about getting into TV-style livestreaming, it would be better selling to a company with actual media experience. Plus plus, Microsoft is basically out of the online advertising industry. Its business is primarily driven by enterprise tools and services, not consumer brands, and making a splashy consumer play would be more distracting than anything. Apple Stephen Lam / Getty The case for Apple (Kara): This is an interesting question, given how beloved Apple is to Twitter’s Dorsey. He’s a longtime Steve Jobs fanboy and also has a lot of respect for the company today. A sale to Apple is one that you can see the recalcitrant Dorsey saying "yes" to more easily. Here’s what Twitter will help Apple with: A real-time news offering (Apple News is just awful); a livestreaming opportunity that it could tout on iPhones; a decent social presence and worldwide platform (remember Ping? I do, but only me!); an ad business that Apple can actually succeed with; a still-cool mobile app. It’s not hard to see how Apple could integrate Twitter with a lot of its services and make them instantly better. Still, Apple simply does not have a social media culture, and it would need Dorsey there to lead the efforts. And he has another job over at Square, as you might have heard. The case against Apple (Kurt): So, so wrong, Kara. Twitter doesn’t have a single thing Apple might want. Twitter is an advertising business, and Apple is not good at advertising. Twitter doesn’t have any hardware products, and owns virtually nothing when it comes to the kind of high-quality content Apple currently distributes, such as music, movies and television. Apple already offers a superior messaging product to Twitter, and has its own curated news app. And the abuse issues — not the Apple image at all. Maybe Twitter could make Apple a little cooler? But it would be cheaper to just buy something hip, like Carpool Karaoke (Oh, wait!). Big Pipes: Verizon or Comcast Justin Sullivan / Getty The case for Big Pipes (Kara): One major thing: Mobile streaming! It’s a thing, in case ya didn’t know! Let’s start with Verizon, which has so many billions of dollars of cash on its balance sheet and no idea what to do with it. Well, it did use about $10 billon of that to buy stumbling Internet brands AOL and Yahoo, and so far the market has not punished them for it. Why not double down with Twitter and make it a trifecta? Also, Verizon has the management that could actually coordinate it all, especially AOL CEO Tim Armstrong. He’d be helped if he could get Twitter execs like COO Adam Bain and CFO Anthony Noto to stay. Comcast is run by smart people (Disclaimer: NBCUniversal has a huge investment in Recode owner Vox Media) who like to buy value and, if not growth. That’s not Twitter these days, but one reason for them to buy it is that they have a lot of content and other stuff that would be great on the platform. Plus, regulators would let them buy the property, as opposed to video and TV companies, which Comcast can’t do much of. Twitter is not a video company, because wishing you are a video company does not make it so. Could it be someday? Maybe. While I think Verizon is a more likely buyer than Comcast, these would be big stretches for both, and therefore probably more trouble than it is worth. The case against Big Pipes (Kurt): For all the news Twitter has made around its livestreaming efforts, it’s a very minor player in the world of live video distribution. It doesn’t own any significant rights for any significant portion of time, and it isn’t creating new programming. The NFL broadcasts it's distributing aren’t even produced by Twitter — NBC and CBS handle that. Twitter is simply the platform for everyone else’s content, and we have no idea how large or how valuable Twitter’s audience actually is. When Yahoo streamed an NFL game back in 2015, the viewership numbers were terrible by NFL standards. There isn’t much reason (yet) to believe Twitter’s streams will fare any better. Add in the fact that Verizon has paid a combined $10 billion for Yahoo and AOL in the past 18 months. It could probably afford Twitter, too, but what a lineup of troubled companies that would be to fix. Big Media: News Corp/21st Century Fox, Disney Getty Images The case for Big Media (Kara): The case for big media buying Twitter? Because they are still old media, no matter how hard they try to pretend otherwise. When it comes to appealing to younger audiences (also known as digital audiences), even growth-starved Twitter beats them. The main reason for media companies to buy Twitter is that they don’t want another media company to buy Twitter and, good God, not Google or Facebook either, because then all that’s left is Snapchat (and Evan Spiegel is not selling, last time we checked). There has been a lot more noise about Rupert Murdoch’s Fox buying it than any other media giant, but that would be a big bet for him and his two sons. And while Disney has a taste for digital properties (Hello, Vice!) and while Dorsey is on the board of Disney, so is Facebook’s Sandberg. Would I like to be a fly on the wall of that board meeting? Yes! The case against Big Media (Kurt): How many traditional media companies can comfortably afford an $18 billion acquisition? Few. Twitter is likely too expensive for News Corp/Fox or Time Warner or Disney. Media organizations already get most of the benefits of Twitter’s product — free content distribution— without the headache that comes with running it. Plus, Twitter is hungry for any and all high-quality video content, which means rights holders like Turner (Time Warner) can easily ink deals with Twitter if need be. No need to open the checkbook. There’s also this: Twitter is valuable because media companies see it as a neutral platform. Imagine this scenario that one source jokingly suggested: "The Arab Spring live on Twitter, brought to you by Rupert Murdoch and Fox News!" Yeah, not so much. The Chinese Internet giants The case for a Chinese buyer (Kurt): Chinese tech companies are all looking for a foot in the door when it comes to monetizing U.S. consumers. Twitter could be that giant toe as a big trophy property! Tencent-owned messaging app WeChat, which dominates in China, has tried unsuccessfully to build a U.S. audience in the past, and appears to have given up that plan. Momo, another Chinese messaging service, has a similar story. That might make a company like Twitter, which has 66 million U.S. users and lots of business partnerships with U.S. advertisers, an attractive option to Chinese tech giants like Tencent, Alibaba and Baidu. The case against a Chinese buyer (Kara): Have you all heard about the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States? Well, welcome to the committee that would say "no" to such a deal tout de suite. As it notes on its website, "CFIUS is an inter-agency committee authorized to review transactions that could result in control of a U.S. business by a foreign person (‘covered transactions’), in order to determine the effect of such transactions on the national security of the United States." In other words: The deal busters. Simply put, the U.S. will not let Chinese interests own a global platform like Twitter. You think Trump is mean to the Mexicans? Imagine what he’d say about this sale. Same with Hillary Clinton and pretty much everyone else in D.C. Salesforce Justin Sullivan / Getty The case for Salesforce (Kurt): Well, Salesforce just bought Quip, whose CEO, Bret Taylor, recently joined Twitter’s board. Some people think he’d be a good fit to run Twitter’s core product, too, although he says he’s not interested. Otherwise ... I got nothing. Kara? The case against Salesforce (Kara): I got nothing. While CEO Marc Benioff likes to buy things, according to sources at Salesforce, these rumors about his interest in Twitter are just that, and such a purchase is unlikely. But it is a fun idea, because Benioff is fun! Private Equity Andy Dean Photography / Shutterstock The case for private equity (Kara): What a wonderful world it would be if Twitter could be run in a quiet place, instead of being perpetually naked in the middle of Times Square as it is now. It could cut costs, thin down, focus and maybe finally realize its very unrealized potential. All gone would be the persistent detractors (Saccattack!), the shareholder activists (who are gathering even now for a new attack), the irksome media (I blame myself) and all the leaky board members, employees, ex-employees and sundry players. Sounds dreamy? It is! Calling Silver Lake, stat! The case against private equity (Kurt): I blame Kara, too! The biggest issue here is price. Twitter is just too expensive as it stands right now for most private equity firms to justify purchasing. These kinds of deals usually happen when a business actually makes money — investors want some kind of return on their investment — and Twitter is still losing money each quarter. recode_divider Apple With Apple now selling used iPhones, the new phone market may have peaked Health Care 23andMe President Andy Page is departing Recode Daily Recode Daily: Snapchat is speeding toward its IPO Chorus Terms of Use Privacy Policy Communications Preferences Contact Send Us a Tip Masthead Sponsorships Podcasts Newsletters All Systems Operational Check out our status page for more details.

ROS LBoard 1 Dr Mahathir won’t be attending Bersih 5 rally FMT Reporters Read More FMT BAHASA FMT BORNEO+ FMT VIDEO CONTRIBUTE NEWS HOME NATION OPINION WORLD LEISURE SPORTS BUSINESS ADVERTISE WITH US Indonesia to probe Google over alleged unpaid tax bill AFP | September 15, 2016 The government has repeatedly asserted the California-based company had outstanding tax issues to resolve. JAKARTA: Indonesia said Thursday it would launch investigations into Google after the technology giant allegedly refused to cooperate with the country’s tax department, an official said. Google has denied the allegations, declaring it had paid all taxes in Indonesia since opening its Jakarta offices in 2011. The government has repeatedly asserted the California-based company had outstanding tax issues to resolve. Muhammad Haniv, a senior official with Jakarta’s tax office, said Google had refused a request to allow tax officials to examine its financial statements. “We are now elevating this to an investigation, because they refused to be examined. This could be classified as a criminal offence,” Haniv told AFP, adding Google generates tens of millions in advertising revenue but contributed little in tax. In a statement Jason Tedjasukmana, the head of corporate communications for Google Indonesia, said the company had always worked closely with the government and had “complied by paying all taxes which apply in Indonesia”. Jakarta has also applied pressure to other foreign tech behemoths such as Facebook and Yahoo over their tax arrangements inside Indonesia. Global tech businesses have flooded Indonesia in recent years to capitalise on the exploding number of internet users in the Southeast Asian nation, which has an enormous youth population adept at using smartphones. A third of Indonesia’s 255 million have access to the internet but analysts say that number is likely to increase as connectivity improves across the sprawling archipelago.

X Australia warns accountancy firms against avoiding ‘Google tax’ Authorities ask firms not to use new ‘Australian partnership’ tax scheme Thu, Sep 15, 2016, 13:30 Jamie Smyth in Sydney Australian tax authorities asked multinationals not to use a newly devised tax scheme. Photograph: iStock         Australia has warned the Big Four accountancy firms against undermining its crackdown on multinational tax avoidance by creating “artificial and contrived” schemes to sidestep new laws modelled on the UK’s “Google tax”. The Australian Taxation Office (ATO) issued an alert on Thursday asking multinationals not to use a newly devised tax scheme, which uses an “Australian partnership” structure to try and reduce foreign companies’ tax bills while still allowing them to divert profits offshore. Mark Konza, ATO deputy commissioner, said some accountancy firms were telling clients they could provide them with “inoculation” from the new “Google tax” laws.  “We are concerned this particular scheme is another creative attempt to undermine the policy intent of the multinational anti-avoidance law,” Mr Konza said. Shot across the bows Chris Evans, professor of tax at the UNSW Business School Australia, said this was a shot across the bows of the Big Four, which were likely to be providing similar advice to multinational clients in the UK. “It’s a game with billions of dollars at stake,” he said. “It would be remiss for companies not to get advice on whether they are subject to these laws and for their advisers to try and circumvent the most draconian aspects of them in a legal manner.” Global regulators are targeting aggressive multinational tax avoidance, including in Europe, notably through the commission’s €13 billion ruling on Apple. In January, Google reached a settlement with the UK to pay £130 million (€153 million) in back taxes in a controversial deal linked to Britain’s new “diverted profits tax”. Australia is following the UK in implementing tough anti-avoidance laws, including new rules put in place in January which cancel tax benefits obtained from tax avoidance schemes and increases penalties on income that companies seek to shift offshore. But the ATO is becoming frustrated with schemes devised by the Big Four accountancy firms that, it claims, set out to exploit legal loopholes and unfairly shields multinationals from tax on sales made to Australian customers.  ADVERTISEMENT ‘Clever scheme’ “I told them it was a clever scheme and that cleverness is not a compliment in the tax world, and we would commence an audit of their client as soon as I got back to the office,” an ATO officer told the Australian Financial Review.  The latest alert issued by the ATO – its third this year – relates to a newly devised tax scheme that interposes an Australian partnership between the foreign company and its Australian customer. This enables the company to claim the partnership is technically an “Australian entity” for tax purposes and so the new anti-avoidance laws should not apply. However, under the complex structure, the company’s profits are predominantly allocated to offshore entities for tax purposes, according to the ATO.  Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand said it was not aware which firms were involved with the particular scheme referred to in the ATO tax alert. “The ATO clearly feels that the days of using a black-letter-law approach to tax planning are well and truly over and advisers should be more focused on the spirit of the law,” said Michael Croker, tax leader at the chartered accountants organisation. Jason Casas, head of transfer pricing at Grant Thornton, said: “It is becoming clear that any attempt to set up any artificial or contrived structures to sidestep the new anti-avoidance law will only increase a company’s tax risk.” – (Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2016)       Topics: Apple tax Chris Evans Jason Casas Mark Konza Michael Croker Australian Taxation Office Unsw Business School Australia Apple Google Read More European Commission refuses to comment on Noonan claims EU tax harmonisation: an issue that won’t go away Apple expects to offset €13bn Irish tax bill by paying less in US Cantillon: Apple’s Irish tax woes the least of its problems No state-aid inquiries expected after Apple case, says Kenny Margrethe Vestager not afraid to take on Europe’s taxing issues Commission may examine 300 more Irish tax rulings Revenue chairman disputes Apple claims of 2% tax deal EU not investigating Google’s European tax deals – Vestager ‘Irish Times’ poll: Majority support appeal of Apple ruling Subscribe.   More from The Irish Times Technology Facebook finds three errors in calculating advert effectiveness Personal Finance The bond rout and Irish pension savers: what you need to be aware of Gaelic Games Ciarán Murphy: Castleknock GAA club prove that sometimes less is more Economy Has the European Commission called time on austerity?

According to Google’s Apps Status dashboard, by 4 a.m. Thursday, Gmail had been restored for the majority of the millions of global users hit by Wednesday’s outtage of Gmail and other apps used by Google for Work clients. But as Work Day 2 of the glitch geared up, many users — including those at the Centre Daily Times and its corporate network at McClatchy — found themselves still in email blackout. Posts on the website Downdetector indicated some users in Australia and Western Europe also remained in a digital black hole. “Still down in Austria :(” reported Luce at 5 a.m. “All down here in UK also :( Can’t sign in using iPhone or desktop,” according to DreamBodyClub about 5 a.m. Until the outage is fully resolved, customers can contact the CDT at centredaily@yahoo.com.

CONTENT Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide POPULAR TOPICS Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Popular Topics  Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Twitter Google+ Facebook Youtube RSS Search SlashGear Search Google Maps adds speed limits to Android app and Android Auto Shane McGlaun - Sep 15, 2016 2 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit We have all been cruising down the road at one time or another and wondered exactly what the speed limit was on the road. Often this thought comes to mind right after we see a police car. The problem is for a lot of the roads there are no speed limit signs or they are few and far between. Google has an update for its Google Maps app rolling out that will help us know what the speed limit is. Google Maps is now showing speed limit icons on maps on Android Auto and on the Android app. This is a feature that many people have bemoaned the lack of for a long time. The first hints that Google was set to roll out speed limits came in mention inside the APK for Google Maps v9.35 beta. A toggle was spied under Navigation Settings that would display speed limits or not, but in that beta the toggle didn’t work. Now the feature appears to be rolling out with a user posting an image of Google Maps running on Android Auto in the car with the speed limit icon clearly seen in the bottom right corner. While some GPS devices on the market will also show you your actual speed and alert you if you go over the speed limit, it’s unclear if Google is offering this feature. The catch for now is that the speed limit icon is only showing up for users here and there. It isn’t available for everyone yet. There is no word from Google on the new feature or how it may be rolling it out to all users. Presumably, it will eventually land for all, we just don’t know when or if this might just be a limited beta for a few users in some areas.

Advertisement Description Technical Change Log Comments How To Browse Privately In Google Chrome Google’s game changing browser Chrome combines sophisticated technology with a simple UI, to create a faster, safer and easier browsing experience. Launched in 2008, Google Chrome quickly dominated the browser market to become the most used browser globally within 4 years of its public release. Google’s rapid and continuous development cycle ensures the browser continues to compete with the other most popular and advanced web browsers available. Speed Perhaps the area Google invested most of its development time to differentiate from other browsers. Google Chrome launches extremely quickly from your desktop, runs applications at speed thanks to a powerful JavaScript engine and loads pages rapidly using the WebKit open source rendering engine. Add to this quicker search and navigation options from the simplified UI and you have a browser that is pretty hard to beat on speed, especially if gaming is your thing. Clean, simple UI Google Chrome’s most striking feature and a substantial factor in its popularity - the simple UI hasn’t changed much since the beta launch in 2008. Google focused on trimming down unnecessary toolbar space to maximise browsing real estate. The browser is made up of 3 rows of tools, the top layer horizontally stacks automatically adjusting tabs, next to a simple new tabs icon and the standard minimize, expand & close windows controls. The middle row includes 3 navigation controls (Back, Forward & Stop/Refresh), a URL box which also allows direct Google web searching and a star bookmarking icon. Extensions and browser settings icons line up to the right of the URL box. The third row is made up of bookmark folders and installed apps. Easily overlooked now, this clean UI was a breath of fresh air compared to the overcrowded toolbars of popular browsers pre-2008. Privacy Another hugely popular feature, Incognito mode allows you to browse privately by disabling history recording, reducing traceable breadcrumbs and removing tracking cookies on shutdown. Chrome’s settings also allow you to customize regular browsing privacy preferences. Security Chrome’s Sandboxing prevents malware automatically installing on your computer or affecting other browser tabs. Chrome also has Safe Browsing technology built in with malware and phishing protection that warns you if you encounter a website suspected of containing malicious software/activity. Regular automatic updates ensure security features are up to date and effective. Customization A vast selection of apps, extensions, themes and settings make your browsing experience unique to you. Improve productivity, security, navigation speed, pretty much anything you can think of with apps and extensions from the Google Chrome Store. Install themes created by top artists or make your own using mychrometheme.com.

The latest finance round involves Standard Chartered, Accenture Ventures, SCB Digital Ventures, the venture arm of Siam Commercial Bank, and Japan's SBI Holdings. Additional investors include Santander Innoventures, the venture units of CME Group and Seagate Technology, and Venture 51. The latest funding round has brought some large strategic corporate partners onboard with its existing base of investors which include GV, Google's venture arm, Andressen Horowitz, IDG Capital Partners, and AME Cloud Ventures. To date, the company has raised over $93 million in total funding. Ripple's focus is on providing this technology to banks looking to make cross-border payments more efficient. At the moment, an international payment may take a few days to make with a very high cost. Ripple said that its technology could give banks a 33 percent reduction in their operating costs during this process and allow lenders to move money "in seconds". Getty Images A headache for banks is high-volume, but low-value, transactions - the kind that Facebook might pay out to app makers for example. These can often be expensive and not profitable for the banks because it takes a lot of effort to move the money and the percentage cut won't be as high as for a larger transaction. Ripple says that it can potentially make these transactions profitable. The start-up is currently working with 15 of the top 50 global banks including UBS and Santander. Expansion Chris Larsen, the chief executive of Ripple, said the company was investing the fresh funds in global expansion. "We have been expanding our office locations. We want to continue that and grow those teams, we want to be hiring so we can have engineers on the ground with local banking partners as you have to get in there with the banks to make sure you have a complete solution and make things as easy as possible," Larsen told CNBC in a phone interview. The company recently opened an office in Luxemburg and is considering Singapore and Frankfurt as the next locations. Blockchain - which is the basis for Ripple's technology - works like a huge, decentralized ledger for the digital currency bitcoin which records every transaction and stores this information on a global network so it cannot be tampered with. It's this technology that banks feel can be utilized in areas from remittances to securities exchanges. In the future, Larsen said that as an increasing number of devices come online in the so-called "Internet of Things", micropayments could rise. This is where Ripple could take advantage. "With a connected device a hundredth of a penny might need to be sent, that can't happen today. But we are working to make that happen and it opens up a new field of services and revenue for the banks," Larsen said. Experts said that blockchain could have a cost-cutting impact on many parts of a bank's business. A report from analyst firm Juniper Research claimed "in areas such as transaction settlement, the introduction of a blockchain-based system would substantially reduce both the risk of error and the time taken for error checking", but cautioned that the technology needs to be secure. "While blockchain technology offers the potential for increased speed, transparency and security across an array of verticals, there has to be rigorous and robust roadtesting in each unique use case before any decision is taken," Windsor Holden, analyst at Juniper Research, wrote in a report last month. Acquisitions ahead? Ripple's fresh funds have also given the company ammunition for acquisitions. The slower funding environment for start-ups seen towards the end of 2015 and at the beginning of 2016, has given the start-up an opportunity to keen an eye out for acquisitions. "We do think there will be opportunities especially with the change of tone of what's getting funded and not. There will be really good companies that can't get to the next round and might be better for them to be bought out. We will look at opportunities about what we can integrate with our business," Larsen said.

Brian May, Queen's guitarist and also an astrophysicist, has come up with an interactive app - Bohemian Rhapsody Experience - in collaboration with Google and Enosis VR. The prototype of the app is now available for public to use on some select VR-enabled Android smartphones, while the iPhone users will be getting it soon. Bohemian Rhapsody Experience takes you to the virtual world of Queen in an interactive manner, where sound and graphics indulge to form a surreal experience as you were with the Queen on the stage. The interface elements in the app respond to your head movements as well. Google describes Bohemian Rhapsody Experience as an app that "offers a journey through frontman Freddie Mercury's subconscious mind and recreates the sensation of being onstage with the band, with visual and audio elements that respond to your movements."The California-based company demoed the app's prototype version at its annual I/O developer conference earlier this year, which was only available to be seen if you were at the event. But, Google has now released the Bohemian Rhapsody Experience app on Android. You can head to the Google Play store to download it. Remember, this will work properly only with Android smartphones that are VR-enabled, but other users can enjoy the experience as a 360-degree video. Interestingly, the Bohemian Rhapsody Experience app will induce a spatialised version of the song as you move your head, which actually conforms to fixed points in your surroundings. You will also get to see Freddie Mercury, outlined in neon, dancing and performing as the song takes leap immersively, along with a bunch of other animations. It is worth mentioning that Google started making such enriched content way back in 2013, when virtual reality was in infancy and not that mainstream. Google is also known for working with directors like Mark Oftedal, Shannon Tindle and others - to imbibe their work into the Google's 360-degree storytelling technology called Google Spotlight Stories.

But the day got off to a rough start. According to Google’s Apps Status dashboard, by 4 a.m. EDT Thursday, Google announced that Gmail had been restored for the majority of the millions of global users hit by Wednesday’s outtage of Gmail and other apps used by Google for Work clients. But as Work Day 2 of the glitch geared up, many users — including those at the Miami Herald and its corporate network at McClatchy Co. — found themselves still in email blackout. Google for Work addressed scores of angry customers in its early morning tweets, most of them asking people to call Google for help, and promising to fully investigate the cause of the outage and upgrade its neand . Posts on the website Downdetector indicated some users in Australia and Western Europe also remained in a digital black hole. “Still down in Austria :(” reported Luce at 5 a.m. EDT. “All down here in UK also :( Can't sign in using iPhone or desktop,” according to DreamBodyClub about 5 a.m. EDT. The Miami Herald began receiving e-mails again starting at about 1:40 p.m. The tweets to @GoogleforWork tapered off but by nightfall, yet there were still a number of frustrated customers awaiting restored service.

Google has denied the allegations, declaring it had paid all taxes in Indonesia since opening its Jakarta offices in 2011. The government has repeatedly asserted the California-based company had outstanding tax issues to resolve. Google has denied allegations that it did not cooperate with Indonesia's tax department, declaring it had paid all taxes in the country since opening its Jakarta offices in 2011 ©Justin Sullivan (Getty/AFP/File) Muhammad Haniv, a senior official with Jakarta's tax office, said Google had refused a request to allow tax officials to examine its financial statements. "We are now elevating this to an investigation, because they refused to be examined. This could be classified as a criminal offence," Haniv told AFP, adding Google generates tens of millions in advertising revenue but contributed little in tax. In a statement Jason Tedjasukmana, the head of corporate communications for Google Indonesia, said the company had always worked closely with the government and had "complied by paying all taxes which apply in Indonesia". Jakarta has also applied pressure to other foreign tech behemoths such as Facebook and Yahoo over their tax arrangements inside Indonesia. Global tech businesses have flooded Indonesia in recent years to capitalise on the exploding number of internet users in the Southeast Asian nation, which has an enormous youth population adept at using smartphones. A third of Indonesia's 255 million have access to the internet but analysts say that number is likely to increase as connectivity improves across the sprawling archipelago.

Google readies prettier-looking email for mobile Google is giving marketers and publishers tools to create email that adjusts to whatever device its one billion Gmail users are viewing it in. By Liam Tung | September 15, 2016 -- 12:48 GMT (05:48 PDT) | Topic: Mobility Starting later this month, Gmail and Inbox by Gmail emails will adapt to fit screens of all sizes. Image: Google Emails viewed in Gmail on smartphones will soon look like they were made for the small screen, rather than squashed desktop layouts. The better-looking email will arrive as Google begins rolling out support for so-called "responsive web design" in Gmail and Inbox by Gmail. It will allow developers to build better looking email that's easier for recipients to view and interact with, no matter what device they're using. The change will provide better support for emails that use more visual communication, such as the YouTube example Google offers where four video thumbnails are crammed onto the display. New style rules will allow developers to automatically reformat this email for the smaller screen. Google is aiming to address formatting quirks when viewing email on smartphones, which it says stem from a desktop-led, one-size-fits-all approach that can result in squished text, or links and buttons that aren't friendly for touch on smaller-screen mobile devices. It will also allow for smarter-looking email on larger screens. "Starting later this month, Gmail and Inbox by Gmail will support emails created with responsive design, meaning their content adapts to fit screens of all sizes," Google notes. "Text, links, and even buttons will enlarge to make reading and tapping easier on a smaller screen. If you're on desktop, you'll also see improvements, since emails designed for mobile can also adapt to fit larger screens." The support for responsive design means developers can use a range of Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) media rules to automatically adjust formatting based on width, rotation, and resolution, helping tailor email for desktops, tablets and phones. A full list of supported queries for Gmail and Inbox is available, which Google plans on expanding over time.

The company then issued a series of updates to its status page, indicating that service was gradually being restored to increasing numbers of users … Finally, just after 1am on Friday, Google marked the problem as resolved, though it did note that a small minority of customers were still affected.

Please rest assured that system reliability is a top priority at Google, and we are making continuous improvements to make our systems better. If you are still experiencing an issue, please contact us via the Google Help Center. The issue is resolved for the vast majority of affected customers and we will be working individually with the remaining customers affected The company said at one point that it had identified the cause of the failure, but has not shared any details. On a more positive note, the company has announced that it will soon support emails with responsive designs for better mobile viewing.

X Australia warns accountancy firms against avoiding ‘Google tax’ Authorities ask firms not to use new ‘Australian partnership’ tax scheme Thu, Sep 15, 2016, 13:30 Jamie Smyth in Sydney Australian tax authorities asked multinationals not to use a newly devised tax scheme. Photograph: iStock         Australia has warned the Big Four accountancy firms against undermining its crackdown on multinational tax avoidance by creating “artificial and contrived” schemes to sidestep new laws modelled on the UK’s “Google tax”. The Australian Taxation Office (ATO) issued an alert on Thursday asking multinationals not to use a newly devised tax scheme, which uses an “Australian partnership” structure to try and reduce foreign companies’ tax bills while still allowing them to divert profits offshore. Mark Konza, ATO deputy commissioner, said some accountancy firms were telling clients they could provide them with “inoculation” from the new “Google tax” laws.  “We are concerned this particular scheme is another creative attempt to undermine the policy intent of the multinational anti-avoidance law,” Mr Konza said. Shot across the bows Chris Evans, professor of tax at the UNSW Business School Australia, said this was a shot across the bows of the Big Four, which were likely to be providing similar advice to multinational clients in the UK. “It’s a game with billions of dollars at stake,” he said. “It would be remiss for companies not to get advice on whether they are subject to these laws and for their advisers to try and circumvent the most draconian aspects of them in a legal manner.” Global regulators are targeting aggressive multinational tax avoidance, including in Europe, notably through the commission’s €13 billion ruling on Apple. In January, Google reached a settlement with the UK to pay £130 million (€153 million) in back taxes in a controversial deal linked to Britain’s new “diverted profits tax”. Australia is following the UK in implementing tough anti-avoidance laws, including new rules put in place in January which cancel tax benefits obtained from tax avoidance schemes and increases penalties on income that companies seek to shift offshore. But the ATO is becoming frustrated with schemes devised by the Big Four accountancy firms that, it claims, set out to exploit legal loopholes and unfairly shields multinationals from tax on sales made to Australian customers.  ADVERTISEMENT ‘Clever scheme’ “I told them it was a clever scheme and that cleverness is not a compliment in the tax world, and we would commence an audit of their client as soon as I got back to the office,” an ATO officer told the Australian Financial Review.  The latest alert issued by the ATO – its third this year – relates to a newly devised tax scheme that interposes an Australian partnership between the foreign company and its Australian customer. This enables the company to claim the partnership is technically an “Australian entity” for tax purposes and so the new anti-avoidance laws should not apply. However, under the complex structure, the company’s profits are predominantly allocated to offshore entities for tax purposes, according to the ATO.  Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand said it was not aware which firms were involved with the particular scheme referred to in the ATO tax alert. “The ATO clearly feels that the days of using a black-letter-law approach to tax planning are well and truly over and advisers should be more focused on the spirit of the law,” said Michael Croker, tax leader at the chartered accountants organisation. Jason Casas, head of transfer pricing at Grant Thornton, said: “It is becoming clear that any attempt to set up any artificial or contrived structures to sidestep the new anti-avoidance law will only increase a company’s tax risk.” – (Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2016)       Topics: Apple tax Chris Evans Jason Casas Mark Konza Michael Croker Australian Taxation Office Unsw Business School Australia Apple Google Read More European Commission refuses to comment on Noonan claims EU tax harmonisation: an issue that won’t go away Apple expects to offset €13bn Irish tax bill by paying less in US Cantillon: Apple’s Irish tax woes the least of its problems No state-aid inquiries expected after Apple case, says Kenny Margrethe Vestager not afraid to take on Europe’s taxing issues Commission may examine 300 more Irish tax rulings Revenue chairman disputes Apple claims of 2% tax deal EU not investigating Google’s European tax deals – Vestager ‘Irish Times’ poll: Majority support appeal of Apple ruling Subscribe.   More from The Irish Times Technology Facebook finds three errors in calculating advert effectiveness Personal Finance The bond rout and Irish pension savers: what you need to be aware of Gaelic Games Ciarán Murphy: Castleknock GAA club prove that sometimes less is more Economy Has the European Commission called time on austerity?

Last month, we learned that this year’s devices likely won’t bear the Nexus name, instead Google is switching to Pixel and Pixel XL. Now we’re hearing a bit more about the software side of things that are coming in the Android 7.1 update for the Pixel phones. David Ruddock of Android Police has tweeted a mention of a new home button on the Pixel phones that replaces the long-used flower design we’re so familiar with today. The main filled white circle, surrounded by a larger thin circle. When you hold it down, the 4 colored dots then come out. — David Ruddock (@RDR0b11) September 14, 2016 To take that a step further, Ron Amadeo of Ars Technica decided to draw up a mock-up of what the new home button could look like, based on the description provided by David in his tweets. Here’s a quick peek at his speculative design. The round icon design is something David mentions in additional tweets, stating that it’s something Google is considering forcing for all icons. Hardcore Android users have long given Google a hard time for not following its own Android design guidelines when it comes to icon size and several third-party launchers like Nova and Action 3 now include ways to normalize icon size because of this. What do you think of the mock-up? Do you like round icons or would you prefer Google go in a different direction with the new home screen? local_offer    Google   Pixel   Pixel XL   Auto-load comments: Off On View comments (19) stars Further Reading OnePlus 3T charging proves solid Allo gets themes, emoji suggestions, and more Google and Facebook are challenging bogus websites Google WiFi preorders launch Free Daydream Views now available stars Popular this Weeklaunch 1 more_vertThis may be the Moto X 2017 closeHere’s our first look at the 2017 Moto X The Moto X 2017 may be alive and well as a new image has appeared which shows off the device’s metal body and camera cutout. 2 more_vertExclusive: Project ARA specifications, design closeExclusive: Project ARA specifications, design and photos Today’s exclusive Google Project ARA post reveals the phone’s spec sheet and 40 images which show off the phone’s unique modular design. 3 more_vertZTE wants to step up and fill the Nexus gap closeZTE wants to fill the gap left behind with the end of Nexus devices With the end of the Nexus line, there’s now a void in stock Android devices in the $400 range.

Indonesia today said it will investigate Google’s Indonesian branch for on suspicion of unpaid taxes. — Reuters picJAKARTA, Sept 15 — Indonesia’s tax office will investigate Alphabet Inc’s Google for suspected unpaid taxes from billions of dollars worth of advertising revenue, a senior finance ministry official said today. Muhammad Hanif, head of the specials cases branch in the tax office, said Google’s refusal to cooperate after it was sent a letter in April requesting to be allowed to examine the company’s tax reports had raised suspicions. He told a news conference that the probe would not be launched until the end of the month at the earliest. PT Google Indonesia, incorporated in 2011, said it was complying with the government. “We continue to cooperate fully with local authorities and pay all applicable taxes,” a Google Indonesia spokesman said in an emailed response to questions. The government had also asked to examine the tax reports of the Indonesian offices of three other US Internet-based companies — Yahoo, Twitter and Facebook. Those three companies have complied, officials said. Yahoo and Google have formed Indonesian limited liability companies, while Twitter and Facebook operate branches of their Asia-Pacific offices in Indonesia. The government believes these companies owe income and value added tax on billions of dollars of revenue they generate from advertising in Indonesia, the tax office said. Hanif said Google’s Indonesian entity was only allocated around 4 per cent of the total revenues generated from the country, and it was this amount that was taxed, which he described as too small and “unfair”. The communications ministry had estimated the value of digital advertising in Indonesia at about US$800 million (RM3.3 billion) last year. The ministry said all of it was untaxed. There was no immediate explanation for the wide discrepancy of the two agencies’ estimates for digital advertising revenue. Indonesia is facing a sizeable revenue shortfall this year as the resource-rich country can no longer rely on commodity-related income.

With the advent of affordable smartphones and growing reach of internet across the country, India's online population will reach 500 million by 2020, Google's Asia Pacific Language Head, Richa Singh Chitranshi said. "India's online population will reach 500 million by 2020 with majority of them being local language users," Chitranshi said while addressing IT students at Rajiv Gandhi Proayogiki (Technology) Vishwavidyalaya (RGPV) here. The event was jointly organised by RGPV and MPPOST, an online portal, on Wednesday. Speaking about the future and present of the internet Chitranshi said it was mainly due to availability of affordable smartphones and data packs that have enabled millions in Indians to go online. She also informed that on Thursday over 65 per cent of India surf the internet through their phones with majority of the new users accessing it for the first time through phones. "Interestingly, not all of them are English speaking users," Richa said. She said out of the 350 million, 150 million internet users are only comfortable with local language and those users will form the majority of the online population in India. Stating that the reach of internet is growing rapidly in the country, she said that net users will go up from the current 43 per cent to 62 per cent by 2020. Chitranshi further pointed out that Google have seen 10 fold growth in local language queries over the past 1.5 years. Hindi content consumption is growing five times the rate at which English content is consumed. She also said that content, speed and products are the priority for the company. The Google Indic keyboard on Android has been downloaded 10 million times. There are 22 official languages in India and Google supports 11 of them including Hindi, Bengali, Tamil, Kannada and seven others. This would help writers in a big way, she added. The initiatives taken by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan in the field of Digital India were also highlighted by MPPOST Founder Editor Sarman Nagele and Madhya Pradesh Rojgar aur Nirman Editor Pushpendra Pal Singh during the event.

REUTERS/Morris Mac Matzen Enlarge Caption  Email More A A JAKARTA: Indonesia's tax office will investigate Alphabet Inc's Google for suspected unpaid taxes from billions of dollars worth of advertising revenue, a senior finance ministry official said on Thursday. Muhammad Hanif, head of the specials cases branch in the tax office, said Google's refusal to cooperate after it was sent a letter in April requesting to be allowed to examine the company's tax reports had raised suspicions. He told a news conference that the probe would not be launched until the end of the month at the earliest. PT Google Indonesia, incorporated in 2011, said it was complying with the government. "We continue to cooperate fully with local authorities and pay all applicable taxes," a Google Indonesia spokesman said in an emailed response to questions. The government had also asked to examine the tax reports of the Indonesian offices of three other U.S. Internet based companies - Yahoo , Twitter and Facebook . Those three companies have complied, officials said. Yahoo and Google have formed Indonesian limited liability companies, while Twitter and Facebook operate branches of their Asia-Pacific offices in Indonesia. The government believes these companies owe income and value added tax on billions of dollars of revenue they generate from advertising in Indonesia, the tax office said. Hanif said Google's Indonesian entity was only allocated around 4 percent of the total revenues generated from the country, and it was this amount that was taxed, which he described as too small and "unfair". The communications ministry had estimated the value of digital advertising in Indonesia at about US$800 million last year. The ministry said all of it was untaxed. There was no immediate explanation for the wide discrepancy of the two agencies' estimates for digital advertising revenue. Indonesia is facing a sizeable revenue shortfall this year as the resource-rich country can no longer rely on commodity-related income. In a separate development, the tax office said it is checking whether Ford Motor Co had avoided paying appropriate taxes, after a local newspaper reported that the U.S. car maker modified imported Everest model vehicles sold in Indonesia to pay a lower tax rate. If the car maker is proven to have caused state losses, it may have to pay back taxes of up to four times the amount it owed, according to Indonesian law. "We have always strictly complied with all Indonesia government regulations and policy, including all import-related tax and customs requirements, related to each of our Ford vehicles officially marketed and sold in the country," a Ford spokesman said. Ford announced in January it is closing all operations in Southeast Asia's biggest economy, where it held less than a 1 percent market share.

 Google and 16 other companies have formed a coalition that wants to police ads on the web Lara O'Reilly Sep. 15, 2016, 7:49 AM 4,496 facebook linkedin twitter email print Sridhar Ramaswamy, senior VP of ads and commerce at Google. Google Google has helped form a coalition group comprising advertising trade associations, advertisers, publishers, and agency groups that aims to rid the web of bad ads. "The Coalition for Better Ads" was announced on Thursday at digital advertising trade show Dmexco in Cologne, Germany. The Coalition was formed as a direct response to the rise of ad blocking, and will act as a kind of regulator for internet ads. The group has been put together to create global standards for online advertising, which will be deployed using technology created by the IAB (Interactive Advertising Bureau)'s Tech Lab. The technology will essentially score ads based on a number of criteria — such as page load time, the number of tracking pixels, and the type of creative — with only ads that meet a certain threshold making it through to the web page of participating companies. On a website announcing the Coalition, the group says it will develop the criteria based on consumer research, which will look into the kind of online ads people love and hate. The first iteration of the scoring system is expected to be released in the fourth quarter of this year, which the scoring software will likely take until 2017 to be released to the market.  The Coalition will be funded by "member contributions," a spokesperson told Business Insider. The founding members of the Coalition include:  American Association of Advertising Agencies (4A’s) Association of National Advertisers (ANA) BVDW Germany Digital Content Next DMA European Publishers Council Google GroupM IAB, IAB Europe, IAB Tech Lab, as well as additional national and regional IABs Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) News Media Alliance Procter & Gamble Unilever The Washington Post World Federation of Advertisers (WFA) Speaking to Business Insider, Stephan Loerke, CEO of the WFA, said one of the incentives for advertising companies to join the coalition or create ads meeting its standards will be his trade organization's members. The WFA represents marketers at major brands, who are responsible for around 90% of global advertising spend. "We are seeing in our membership significant concern about the uptake of ad blocking, not because it is immediately affecting [marketers] but because of the drivers, which are the frustration of people with the quality of their interaction with ads," Loerke said. PageFair and Adobe Interestingly, the coalition does not yet include any consumer groups. However, Alanna Gombert, general manager of the IAB Tech Lab, told Business Insider the research informing the ad standards technology will include direct input from consumers. That will include research that directly monitors consumers' behavior online to see how they react to different forms of advertising, sources told Business Insider earlier this year. Gombert said: "Part of the reason why it's so important we came together is because many of us have consumer groups [as members] and do research constantly so it's great to come together to combine that." How the Coalition came about Business Insider first reported about the early discussions that took place ahead of the launch of the Coalition in May this year. The discussions followed Google executives becoming increasingly vocal about the need for the advertising industry to deal with the rise of ad blockers and the reasons that compel people to download them. Google DoubleClick director of product management Scott Spencer. YouTube In 2015, as the noise around ad blocking grew even louder, Google appointed Scott Spencer, the director of product management for the DoubleClick Ad Exchange business, to lead the "sustainable advertising" unit, which is based in New York City. Appointing such a senior executive, who had joined Google in 2008 when it acquired DoubleClick (where he was VP of product management for its ad serving solutions) was a reflection of how seriously the company was taking the matter. Spencer has been leading Google's discussions with the advertising industry. At the time, sources told us Google was keen for the new acceptable ads policy to be presented as an industry-level effort. Then in June, Business Insider reported the WFA's proposal to create a global advertising watchdog to help regulate internet ads. On Thursday, that proposal became a reality.  Google's other ad blocking concern this week The announcement came a day after Google was forced to disassociate itself with involvement in popular ad blocker Adblock Plus' first ad exchange, which was unveiled earlier this week. At first, Adblock Plus had implied Google would be one of the technology partners that would facilitate the exchange. Google said on Wednesday it was "surprised" by the announcement, denied it had any involvement with the program, and moved to terminate the account of Adblock Plus' ad tech partner ComboTag from its AdX exchange. Google's senior vice president of advertising Sridhar Ramaswamy told journalists Adblock Plus' move from ad blocker to ad seller was "not a business that we want to be part of." That said, Google still does have a business relationship with Adblock Plus. It is one of the large companies that pays Adblock Plus owner Eyeo millions of dollars each year to get its ads whitelisted, meaning its ads still appear to Adblock Plus users, unless those users apply the most strict settings. Adblock Plus is also attempting to form a cross-industry board, known as the Acceptable Ads Committee. The aim is for the independent, non-profit group — which will include ad tech companies, trade bodies, publishers, journalists, and academics — to preside over the Acceptable Ads program, which dictates which "non-intrusive" ads its ad blocker whitelists. However, progress on that has been slow and Adblock Plus hasn't provided an update on the committee since February.

Google Duo Surpasses 10 Million Downloads on the Play Store The application was released on August 16 Sep 15, 2016 11:38 GMT  ·  By Alexandra Vaidos  ·  Share:  Google first mentioned that it was working on a new video-calling application back in May during Google I/O and the company released the Duo app a few months later in August. Google's Duo became a popular application in the Play Store rather quickly and it seems that it's continuing its ascending evolution. The application has just hit 10 million downloads in Play Store and is now on the 127th spot in the top free apps list. Duo now ranks behind the Clash of Clans game and before McDonald's application for the US. Just one week after the company released Duo, Google's Sundar Pinchai took to Twitter to announce that it already reached 5 million downloads. This was quite the performance considering that the application is quite simplistic, with only a few features at hand. However, it seems that Google's Duo needed a few more weeks to gather another 5 million downloads. The application makes it easy to place video calls and it can easily switch between Wi-Fi and mobile data. In addition, the app displays a preview of the caller so that the receiver can see who initiated the call and answer. Google Duo has 4.4 stars on the Play Store, which is quite a high rating considering that Hangouts has 3.9 stars. During Google I/O, the company also announced a new messaging application, called Allo. This one has yet to be released, but it does come with some really exciting features, including encryption and integration with Google Assistant. #Google#Duo#Allo#Play Store#Hangouts reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Incognito Chats in Google Allo Have Snapchat-Like Expiring Messages Google’s Allo Lets Users Delete Messages from Chat History Google Duo Becomes the Most Popular Free App in the Play Store Google to Add Audio Calls Support in Duo Some U.S. Android Phones Have Secret Backdoor That Sends Data to China - Update OnePlus 3T vs OnePlus 3: Is It Worth the Upgrade?

Twitter Facebook Google+ LinkedIn Instagram YouTube RSS Skip to content SEO News Content Marketing Social Media Paid Search Work Life Events Advertise Google Updates Schema Guidelines for Local Business Reviews Local Search  SEO August 29, 2016 Local Search SEO Matt SouthernAugust 29, 2016 SEJ STAFF 697SHARES 2.5KREADS 697SHARES 2.5KREADS SEJ STAFFMatt Southern 697SHARES 2.5KREADS Google has made a number of notable updates to its Schema guidelines with respect to how local businesses can markup the reviews they receive. In addition to adding new rules that were not previously in place, Google has also disallowed a few practices that were once considered perfectly acceptable. For example, businesses used to be able to add markup to reviews received from third-party sites, but that is now no longer the case. To clarify, it’s OK to include third-party reviews on your website, as long as they are not marked up with Schema. From now on, Google wants to see Schema markup only on reviews “that have been directly produced by your site.” If the exact same review has been syndicated elsewhere, marking it up with Schema will now be a violation of Google’s guidelines. If you use, or are planning to use Schema markup on reviews published on your website, it’s fairly important to review the new guidelines to ensure they are still being followed. Here they are verbatim: Snippets must not be written or provided by the business or content provider unless they are genuine, independent, and unpaid editorial reviews. Reviews must allow for customers to express both positive and negative sentiments. They may not be vetted by the business or restricted by the content provider based on the positive/negative sentiment of the review before submission to Google. Reviews cannot be template sentences built from data or automated metrics. For example, the following is not acceptable: “Based on X number of responses, on average people experienced X with this business.” Reviews for multiple-location businesses such as retail chains or franchises can only be submitted for the specific business location for which they were written. In other words, reviews for multiple-location businesses cannot be syndicated or applied to all business locations of the same company. Aggregators or content providers must have no commercial agreements paid or otherwise with businesses to provide reviews. Do not include reviews that are duplicate or similar reviews across many businesses or from different sources. Only include reviews that have been directly produced by your site, not reviews from third- party sites or syndicated reviews.

I’m going to hit up my clients ASAP. Thanks for the idea. Chetna Well, this brings an end to paid review services… and, I am glad about it. No more deceptive reviews to make fool of a customer. Good job done Google. Dre Are you being sarcastic? lol Vistasadmedia thanks for the update Matt , this will make an end to fake reviews. Guess This is really going to effect in local rankings Dre Please advise how you came to this conclusion? To me the opposite seems true because now website owners can markup their own customer reviews that are potentially fake (the owner can say they are real all he wants and post only 4-5 star reviews, excluding any 1 star reviews) So can someone explain this logic to me, because I am confused… Thanks Dre Thank you for sharing this, however I am still confused how this Google update limits fake reviews? From what I understand Google trusts website owners to post their customers legitimate reviews on their site and mark them up with schema without needing to provide any proof… So Charles Lewis below has a great point “is this approval to use Schema and markup on all those testimonial emails my clients got?” Can you please elaborate on this, because from my understanding this is exactly what Google is allowing. Thanks semalaia4n nice information of the google updates. the customer knows what to expect. I will need to look into whether or not we have schema with the reviews we currently have.Thanks for sharing the post.

Analysis Brussels’ widely leaked copyright reforms [PDF] have been formally published. The proposals are intended to “reduce the differences between national copyright regimes and allow for wider online access to works by users across the EU.” They will be tossed about and amended in European Parliament for many months. But with an activist European Court of Justice fulfilling its date with destiny, and ripping up the law and making its own on the hoof, it’s largely moot. The Commission’s role here is to look busy but not break too much. As one Brussels source explained to us: “Thorough reform of the digital landscape would entail re-visiting the E-commerce Directive – and no one wants to touch that.” So it’s a symphony of tweaks, instead, like an orchestra warming up but never getting to the opening bars of the score. Much of it is for show. As with all things Brussels, it’s been an almighty lobbyfest, as various trade groups jostle for breaks. That was complicated by the EU’s sponsorship of an ersatz “civil society” – digital groups who mainly lobby for the large US tech companies. For example, note the way the Commission congratulates itself on how wise it is: “New exceptions that reduce to some extent the rightholders’ monopoly are justified by other public interest objectives. These exceptions are likely to have a positive impact on the right to education and on cultural diversity.” This refers to Brussels’ harmonising copyright exceptions on text and data mining museums’ and libraries’ copies for preservation, and some educational uses. Member states have already brought in their own exceptions already covering these areas; the UK did in 2014. Member states will be obliged “to put in place a legal mechanism to facilitate licensing agreements of out-of-commerce works and other subject-matter”; although it’s hard to imagine how that can be done – it’s waffle, really. To address the user-generated content (UGC) loophole – described here with our fictional wellie company – UGC platforms will be invited “to take appropriate and proportionate measures to ensure the functioning of agreements concluded with rightholders and to prevent the availability on their services of content identified by rightholders in cooperation with the service providers.” That’s a recommendation that effective identifying technology like Google’s Content ID is used, to prevent the whack-a-mole situation. Article 14 of the E-Commerce directive was intended to protect operations like storage services: the operator loses the liability protection if they’re found to be “optimising the presentation of the uploaded works or subject matter or promoting them.” It’s hard to see how YouTube, whose business is founded on UGC uploaders uploading other people’s stuff, qualifies for this protection. What the platforms will be required to do will be merely to notify how their filtering or ID-ing software is performing. Nevertheless, expect to hear the phrase “Breaking the Internet” bounded about. In another symbolic gesture, news publishers get a right to ask for money from snippets scraped by aggregators and search engines like Google. It’s a way of the Commission saying news is important – other publishers don’t get the right. Google’s reaction to this experiment so far, in Spain and Germany, has been to tell the publishers to get stuffed. And because so many publishers are in the the clickbait mentality where they value Google’s traffic, they’ve capitulated. Unless news publishers can support themselves, and realise Google’s traffic isn’t actually worth very much, the new ancillary right doesn’t change the landscape much. Portability: too hot for here Much of the reaction has been bland, but one exception came from the TV and movie sector, in which the Brexiting UK leads. Some 70,000 work in audiovisual in the UK, and the sector provides decent employment for many engineers and other techies. A joint statement by 16 groups involved in TV and broadcasting – including Pact, the indie producers association, production and distribution – said the EU had failed the sector. The issue of mandating cross-border licensing – so a producer couldn't do a deal for one territory at one price before selling the work elsewhere – is being addressed separately. But it still gets a broadside. TV producers say that Brussels’ “new proposal goes against its political commitment to foster economic growth and jobs in Europe and the obligation to respect cultural diversity in Europe under the Lisbon Treaty. The proposed Regulation does not "respect the value of rights in the audiovisual sector, as territoriality without full exclusivity has no meaning. Offering less than full exclusivity will generate less income, with a negative impact both on raising financing and on recoupment.” The UK might have left the EU by the time this is passed by Parliament, but destroying territoriality would remove from UK AV exporters the ability to price by region. And that’s the elephant in the room that nobody really wants to talk about. The EU expanded so hastily there are huge disparities between income and spending across the region. Issuing grand decrees from Brussels that wish the digital single market into existence doesn’t change that. ® Sponsored: 10 Reasons LinuxONE is the best choice for Linux workloads Tips and corrections 7 Comments More from The Register European Union set to release anti-competition hounds on Google News Corp's Google News complaint has sprouted in Brussels 43 Comments European Patent Office inks deal with staff union it isn't locked in death spiral with The other union?

Google Updates Gmail with Responsive Design for Emails GO Google brought a major change in formatting Sep 15, 2016 11:07 GMT  ·  By Alexandra Vaidos  ·  Share:  Google has been paying a lot of attention to its most important applications recently, and it seems that Gmail has just received an update. As it turns out, Google has updated its Gmail application with responsive designs for emails. In a blog post, Gmail's Product Manager Pierce Vollucci mentioned that Gmail and Inbox by Gmail would support emails created with responsive design starting later this month. This means that the content of emails will adapt to fit screens of all sizes. In addition, text, links and buttons will have the capacity to enlarge and make reading and tapping easier on a smaller screen. Reading emails can be quite uncomfortable on small screens and Google intends to address this situation. He stated that “these changes will make your email experience as comfortable and intuitive as possible. And as responsive design becomes more common, you’ll continue to see emails that fit better on all your screens and devices.” Google provided email designers with tools for formatting their messages Google also provided email designers with instructions on how to use CSS media queries with Gmail and Inbox by Gmail, as to make sure that their message is formatted properly and is accurately displayed on a computer, tablet or phone. Email designers will be able to change styles based on width, rotation and resolution. Therefore, more responsive formatting will be provided to optimize emails for every device. Google is currently looking to expand CSS support in Gmail and offer email designers more tools to control how messages are displayed. Just recently, Google updated Gmail for Android and web with security warnings which display a question mark on the sender's profile or avatar, so that the receiver would known that the sender couldn't be authenticated. Messages need to be authenticated with Sender Policy Framework or DKIM and when this fails, the receiver gets a warning.   CHECK OUT THE GALLERY  (2 Images) #Google#Gmail#Inbox by Google#Android#Web application subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Gmail updated with responsive design (2 Images) 01 02 Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Google Launches In Apps Search for Finding Content Inside Applications Instagram App Hits 1 Billion Mark in Google's Play Store Google Updates Gmail for Android and Web with Security Warnings Yahoo Releases Radar, a Mobile Travel Guide and Assistance App Some U.S. Android Phones Have Secret Backdoor That Sends Data to China - Update OnePlus 3T vs OnePlus 3: Is It Worth the Upgrade?

Muhammad Hanif, head of the specials cases branch in the tax office, said Google's refusal to cooperate after it was sent a letter in April requesting to be allowed to examine the company's tax reports had raised suspicions. “We will elevate this to an investigation because they refused to be examined, and this is definitely an indication of criminal activity,” Hanif told a news conference. He added that the probe would not be launched until the end of the month at the earliest. Taj Meadows, head of policy communication for Google in Asia Pacific, declined to comment immediately on the issue, but said in an emailed response that the company would revert as “soon as it can”. The government had also asked to examine the tax reports of the Indonesian offices of three other U.S. Internet based companies - Yahoo, Twitter and Facebook .

Yahoo and Google have formed Indonesian limited liability companies, while Twitter and Facebook operate branches of their Asia-Pacific offices in Indonesia. The government believes these companies owe income and value added tax on billions of dollars of revenue they generate from advertising in Indonesia, the tax office said. Hanif said Google's Indonesian entity was only allocated around 4 percent of the total revenues generated from the country, and it was this amount that was taxed, which he described as too small and “unfair”. The communications ministry had estimated the value of digital advertising in Indonesia at about $800 million last year. The ministry said all of it was untaxed. There was no immediate explanation for the wide discrepancy of the two agencies' estimates for digital advertising revenue. Indonesia is facing a sizeable revenue shortfall this year as the resource-rich country can no longer rely on commodity-related income. In a separate development, the tax office said it is checking whether Ford Motor Co had avoided paying appropriate taxes, after a local newspaper reported that the US car maker modified imported Everest model vehicles sold in Indonesia to pay a lower tax rate. If the car maker is proven to have caused state losses, it may have to pay back taxes of up to four times the amount it owed, according to Indonesian law. “We have always strictly complied with all Indonesia government regulations and policy, including all import-related tax and customs requirements, related to each of our Ford vehicles officially marketed and sold in the country,” he said. Ford announced in January it is closing all operations in Southeast Asia's biggest economy, where it held a 1 percent market share.

Multimedia Today's Paper Topics ePaper WealthCheck SEARCH Follow Home News Markets Companies Money & Banking Economy Info-tech Opinion Specials Portfolio Catalyst BLink Social Media Computers & Laptops Mobiles & Tablets Other Gadgets India’s online population to touch 500 mn by 2020: Google PTI   ·   print   ·   T+  ·   T- Tweet Over 65% of India surf the internet through their phones Bhopal, Sep 15:   With the advent of affordable smartphones and growing reach of internet across the country, India’s online population will reach 500 million by 2020, Google’s Asia Pacific Language Head, Richa Singh Chitranshi said. “India’s online population will reach 500 million by 2020 with majority of them being local language users,” Chitranshi said while addressing IT students at Rajiv Gandhi Proayogiki (Technology) Vishwavidyalaya (RGPV) here. The event was jointly organised by RGPV and MPPOST, an online portal, yesterday. Speaking about the future and present of the internet Chitranshi said it was mainly due to availability of affordable smartphones and data packs that have enabled millions in Indians to go online. She also informed that today over 65 per cent of India surf the internet through their phones with majority of the new users accessing it for the first time through phones. “Interestingly, not all of them are English speaking users,” Richa said. She said out of the 350 million, 150 million internet users are only comfortable with local language and those users will form the majority of the online population in India. Stating that the reach of internet is growing rapidly in the country, she said that net users will go up from the current 43 per cent to 62 per cent by 2020. Chitranshi further pointed out that Google have seen 10 fold growth in local language queries over the past 1.5 years. Hindi content consumption is growing five times the rate at which English content is consumed. She also said that content, speed and products are the priority for the company. The Google Indic keyboard on Android has been downloaded 10 million times. There are 22 official languages in India and Google supports 11 of them including Hindi, Bengali, Tamil, Kannada and seven others. This would help writers in a big way, she added. The initiatives taken by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan in the field of Digital India were also highlighted by MPPOST Founder Editor Sarman Nagele and Madhya Pradesh Rojgar aur Nirman Editor Pushpendra Pal Singh during the event.

Google Product Lead for Communication Amit Fulay announced the milestone in a tweet saying, "Google Duo is over 10M users on Android, thanks for the love." (Also see: Google Duo Is Fast, Simple, and Out Now) The new video calling app just four days after its global rollout on Google Play made it to the top of the charts as top free app. The Duo app is available in all countries where Google Play is available. Android Police points out that Duo despite hitting 10 million downloads has dropped significantly on top charts on Google Play. In the US, the app is now ranked 124 in the top free apps chart list. In India, Google Duo is however ranked 24 on the top free apps charts.The company's brand new video calling app was launched last month to take on Apple's FaceTime, Microsoft's Skype, Viber, and others similar services. The Duo app lets people call their phone contacts (as long as they have the app installed) and one of the biggest highlight features is it can work even on low networks. Another notable feature of the Duo app is 'Knock Knock,' which essentially shows preview video of the caller and lets people decide whether to answer or not. Google had previously confirmed that the Duo video calling app uses end-to-end encryption and will be HD quality though the app will adjust it as per the available network. To recall, Google Duo was first announced at I/O developers' conference in May.

ITProPortal Search RSS News Features Analysis Guides Reviews Categories Business Hardware Security Software Mobile Enterprise Cloud Networks Public Sector Startups Web Gmail outage affects millions of corporate Google for Work users By Anthony Spadafora An outage to Gmail has left millions of corporate users of its Google for Work service unable to connect to their email accounts. Shares An outage to Google's Gmail email service yesterday left many corporate users frustrated that they were unable to access their mail. Users of the company's Google for Work were unable to access their email with those in the UK and US being hit the hardest by the disruption. Google has investigated why the outage occurred and it is currently working on bringing the service back online. On its App status page, the company posted an update regarding the outage, saying: “We're investigating reports of an issue with Gmail.  We will provide more information shortly. Based on reports, it affects only Google for Work Gmail users.  The users are redirected to a page with 'Service not available, contact your administrator'.” The issue, which was apparently caused by a technical glitch, is concerning considering that Google has promised that its Google Apps Covered Services web interface ”will be operational and available” to its customers at least 99.9 per cent of the time each month. Regular maintenance and scheduled down time could be anticipated and planned for by corporate users but the fact that this outage occurred during peak work hours has affected their productivity and likely their businesses as well. Google was later able to identify the root cause of the issue and implement a potential fix for it. However, the company noted that its Gmail service had been restored for some users but not for everyone. A workaround has been posted by Google and it recommends that users “Disable Gmail Service in Admin Console UI, save the changes, enable it, save the changes” in order to get their Google for Work Gmail back online.  Image Credit: Mon's Images / Shutterstock ABOUT THE AUTHOR Anthony Spadafora Anthony currently resides in South Korea where he teaches and experiences Korean technological advances first hand.

Twitter Facebook Google+ LinkedIn Instagram YouTube RSS Skip to content SEO News Content Marketing Social Media Paid Search Work Life Events Advertise How Machine Learning Impacts SEO SEO September 15, 2016 SEO Anne Ahola WardSeptember 15, 2016 926SHARES 1.8KREADS 926SHARES 1.8KREADS Anne Ahola Ward 926SHARES 1.8KREADS Did you ever think you’d live in a world where the foxiest job title was “Data Scientist,” people who build “models” all day? Well, Weird Science has come to pass. This is our new and very exciting reality. Knowledge and experiences are wrapped together for a new set of challenges, from data scientist to developer to marketers. Last year’s news that Google was using a new machine learning tool called RankBrain — used to contribute to its search engine results — caused a kerfuffle in the SEO world, leaving us wondering just what kind of impact it would have. In general, it seems like the tech industry is feverishly hot on both bots and machine learning (ML) lately. Thousands of data scientist positions are open for hire in Silicon Valley alone. Bots are actually a subset of machine learning called NLP (natural language processing), and the world is buzzing about them. It is my belief that both AI-bot and ML trends will continue to have substantial yet intriguing impacts on SEO in the years to come. But the real story isn’t so much about RankBrain, which is just one of several filters Google applies, as what Google is doing with machine learning in general. To understand how this will impact SEO, we need to understand what machine learning really is. The original definition of Machine Learning is: A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E. Machine learning (ML) is not new as a field. It was first proposed in 1959 as “the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.” The long and the short of it is that ML, while old, is also the new trend du jour.  It’s where machines can predict using data models. Data models learn from data. Data is being produced from all sides by the gigabyte… That’s a major reason why Data Scientist will remain the sexiest job title for a while. Machine learning is more of a statistics-based approach to AI than a lot of people are used to. “Classic AI,” the type that people think about when they think of the horn-rimmed glasses wearing, pocket-protector bearing, MIT or Caltech classic nerd, is about as hip as the outfit they’d be wearing.  That was known as “Symbolic” AI, because symbols were used for concepts, and many researchers thought the brain itself was structured this way. Neurobiologists actually joined the party in the 1990s; the field is called Computational Neuroscience – fancy! ML also applies to people who are accessing data on the internet. You know that any networked GPS game (like Pokemon Go, perhaps) is a geo-specific search, possibly geo-spatial. Geo-spatial means coordinates mapped onto a sphere, with a height component. It’s increasingly common for databases to include geo-search capacities right in their query languages (for example, PostgreSQL stands out here). OK, so what does ML mean to SEOs? Keywords will become less effective over time. Keywords are the SEOs most influential friend right now, and a lot of less knowledgeable SEOs rely on them exclusively (to the detriment of themselves and their clients). Geoff Hinton and Jeff Dean at Google have said that algorithm updates Panda and Penguin were based on machine learning systems they designed. The arms race of search algorithms is guaranteed to always put pressure, even the vanguard, to constantly innovate.  And as the core ranking systems of search engines get updated with newer systems, they will continue to get exponentially smarter. SEOs themselves should not become machines, but they must harness them. An Ever-Evolving Search Algorithm With that in mind, it seems clear that Google’s ultimate aim is to apply machine learning so that its search algorithms will be able to learn and update themselves automatically, and it’s here where the real impact will be felt. The most noticeable impact, from SEO’s perspective, is that there would likely be much fewer updates such as last year’s “Mobilegeddon” when Google started ranking sites on smartphones and tablets according to their “mobile friendliness.” That major update was implemented by humans, and happened suddenly and all at once. With a machine learning-based search algorithm, it’s likely to evolve more gradually instead of making such sudden changes. Aside from that, machine learning should be a welcome boon for reputable SEOs, as it will effectively give them a license to continue doing the good work they’ve already started. Google has long stated it requires two things from websites – that they meet its technical requirements, and they also serve as great resources, which means they should contain lots of relevant and knowledgeable content. Google has always said that websites should first and foremost try to serve up useful content, instead of just keyword-stuffed fluff. It’s likely that machine learning will soon make it even more critical that those requirements are met. Indeed, the evidence suggests that keyword stuffing has already become much less important, as a recent MarketingProfs study points out: The correlation between keywords and high search rankings has decreased across the board. More and more high-ranking sites are not using the corresponding target keyword in the body, description, or links, the analysis found. Sites are also using keywords less in URLs themselves, with only 6 percent doing so in the 2015 study. SEOs have long used keyword targeting as a central part of their strategies, but with the introduction of machine learning, keywords simply won’t be necessary anymore. Machine learning means Google will be better be able to understand which are the most authoritative sites for any search phrase, regardless of if they actually use that specific phrase or not, because it will soon be able to understand the actual content on each site. There’s a reason why Google keeps on pumping out major updates such as  Panda and Pigeon. And it may come as a shock to some, but Google doesn’t do it just to frustrate SEOs (that’s just a bonus for them). Rather, it’s all about Google cementing its dominant market share in search, by serving up the best possible results for customers, so they don’t need to look elsewhere. Every single algorithm update has been done with this goal in mind, and the introduction of machine learning has been done for the same reason. Indeed, every search is individualized now, so that when you see results, they are unique to you, but you don’t know why. As such, maybe all SEOs need to worry about is ensuring their websites are packed with high-quality content that users want to reach and share with their friends. No matter what role machine learning comes to play in Google’s search rankings, that will never change. What is Deep Learning? Deep learning is a mix between a buzzword and a concept. The learning part is straight out of AI research and refers to Neural nets. These are data structures that mimic physical neurons in order to simulate brain-like functioning. Recent computing advanced such as cheaper Graphic Processing Units (GPUs) have enabled stacking of neural nets into layers, or even layers or layers. That’s where the deep comes from. Of course, since the field has been around for a long time, the inside joke is that deep learning is really deep marketing. We dream of machines coming to their own conclusions, yet we fear it at the same time. The funny thing is that ML is not new, nor is it truly automated. Humans still need to engage heavily in training machine learning projects (for now).  Self-directed algorithms are a booming field of research, but humans still have to set the parameters. In search marketing, we’re constantly looking at how people try to find things they need. Search algorithms have always been and always will be at the core of AI research.  In Orwell’s 1984, history was constantly rewritten so that the victors would always find the “right” information in a SEARCH.

I think in the future rankbrain will be a gamechanger for seo, but I can see it’s effectiveness growing bit by bit, rather than being an overnight revolution, as I highly doubt rankbrain will learn which websites represent the best results for certain keywords, all in one go.

Muhammad Hanif, head of the specials cases branch in the tax office, said Google's refusal to cooperate after it was sent a letter in April requesting to be allowed to examine the company's tax reports had raised suspicions. "We will elevate this to an investigation because they refused to be examined, and this is definitely an indication of criminal activity," Hanif told a news conference. He added that the probe would not be launched until the end of the month at the earliest. Taj Meadows, head of policy communication for Google in Asia Pacific, declined to comment immediately on the issue, but said in an emailed response that the company would revert as "soon as it can." The government had also asked to examine the tax reports of the Indonesian offices of three other U.S. Internet based companies — Yahoo, Twitter and Facebook. Those three companies have complied, officials said. Yahoo and Google have formed Indonesian limited liability companies, while Twitter and Facebook operate branches of their Asia-Pacific offices in Indonesia. The government believes these companies owe income and value added tax on billions of dollars of revenue they generate from advertising in Indonesia, the tax office said. Hanif said Google's Indonesian entity was only allocated around 4 percent of the total revenues generated from the country, and it was this amount that was taxed, which he described as too small and "unfair." The communications ministry had estimated the value of digital advertising in Indonesia at about $800 million last year. The ministry said all of it was untaxed. There was no immediate explanation for the wide discrepancy of the two agencies' estimates for digital advertising revenue. Indonesia is facing a sizeable revenue shortfall this year as the resource-rich country can no longer rely on commodity-related income. Related Stories Google Is Making It Easier To View Emails On Smartphones Hackers Can Win $200,000 In Google's New Contest In a separate development, the tax office said it is checking whether Ford Motor Co. had avoided paying appropriate taxes, after a local newspaper reported that the U.S. car maker modified imported Everest model vehicles sold in Indonesia to pay a lower tax rate. If the car maker is proven to have caused state losses, it may have to pay back taxes of up to four times the amount it owed, according to Indonesian law. "We have always strictly complied with all Indonesia government regulations and policy, including all import-related tax and customs requirements, related to each of our Ford vehicles officially marketed and sold in the country," he said. Ford announced in January it is closing all operations in Southeast Asia's biggest economy, where it held a 1 percent market share.

Unofficial Google Pixel XL Render Shows the Design of the Upcoming Phone GO The image was created based on a leaked live picture Sep 15, 2016 09:59 GMT  ·  By Alexandra Vaidos  ·  Share:  Google has apparently decided to rebrand upcoming Nexus Sailfish and Nexus Marlin phones into Pixel and Pixel XL. This could possibly mean that the line of Nexus smartphones could very well be dead, but an official statement has yet to be made. Google's Pixel XL leaked in a live image a few days ago, but the picture was quite blurry and didn't give out a clear view of the smartphone. Reddit user bndki took the live image and created a render of the smartphone's front based on it. The unofficial render does offer a clear view of the smartphone's display, showing the front camera and the rounded corners of the device. The image doesn't really reveal much in terms of functionality, but fans can get an idea of what the smartphone will look like. Pixel is expected to have the same design as the Pixel XL, but the phones will differ in terms of display size and resolution, as well as other aspects. Pixel smartphones could run Snapdragon 821 SoC Google's Pixel XL is expected to come with the G logo on the back and a display size of about 5.5 inches with 1440 x 2560 pixel resolution. It should also run Snapdragon 821 SoC, making the two Pixel phones the first devices in the US to come with the latest processor from Qualcomm. In addition, Pixel could have 4GB of RAM and a very powerful 12MP camera on the back, with 8MP in the front. Internal capacity is said to reach 32GB and the phone could come with a 2,770mAh battery. The display size for Pixel could reach 5.2-5.3 inches with Full HD resolution. The two phones could be made available with Android 7.1 Nougat out of the box, said to come with the Pixel Launcher and Google Assistant. Google is expected to host an event on October 4, during which it could actually announce the two phones. #Google#Pixel#Pixel XL#Android 7.1 Nougat#Snapdragon 821 subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Google Pixel XL Leaks in Blurry Live Image Google Renamed Nexus Launcher as Pixel Launcher Google Pixel XL to Carry a Price Tag of $649 in the US Google Pixel XL Leaks in New Clear Case Renders Some U.S. Android Phones Have Secret Backdoor That Sends Data to China - Update OnePlus 3T vs OnePlus 3: Is It Worth the Upgrade?

Follow @ShiraOvide Facebook Twitter Email Print Share Sep 15, 2016 5:30 AM EDT APPLE INC +2.72 As of 2:39 PM EST 109.83 USD ALPHABET INC-CL A +4.25 As of 2:39 PM EST 779.41 USD One U.S. tech superpower after another has found itself in the cross-hairs of European corporate cops over taxes, monopoly power and misuse of consumer data. To some, this reeks of overreach by an Old Continent jealous of Silicon Valley. Yet on closer examination, the tough medicine prescribed by Brussels watchdogs such as antitrust boss Margrethe Vestager may end up doing some good for Amazon, Google, Facebook and Apple. It won't feel that way, but Vestager and co. may spur them to improve business practices and curb some impulses that might ultimately end up self-defeating. The U.S. is meant to hold these giants to account too, but national pride, a laissez-faire regulatory culture, and political influence has blunted it.  Here are three areas where the U.S. tech powers could benefit from the bashing by Brussels: Tax Vestager's creative application of competition law to get Ireland to collect at least 13 billion euros ($14.6 billion) in unpaid tax from Apple will surely force U.S. tech companies and other multinationals to re-examine their aggressive avoidance tactics. Apple can't forever cook up convoluted ways to route much of its profit through Bermuda and elsewhere. Eventually someone will force it to change, and the European crackdown could spur Apple and others to move more quickly to a sustainable tax structure. Vestager can't take all the credit since the OECD and G20 were working on this already. But her bully pulpit is powerful. Digital Data Rules and Privacy Edward Snowden's revelations on online U.S. surveillance led some European governments to demand that more data is stored in the region. Although few laws were passed, the risk of a clampdown led Amazon, Microsoft, and IBM to double their number of EU data centers providing cloud services to European companies. Result: their European cloud computing business trounced most local providers. Home Field Advantage U.S. cloud computing providers helped seal their dominance of Europe by building more local data centers. Since 2011, the top seven U.S. cloud players have gone from 9 to 26 data centers in the region. Source: International Data Corporation IDC data classifies this data as "Public Cloud Revenue by Service Provider by Region" Elsewhere, European politicians, regulators and consumers have a healthy suspicion of how Silicon Valley uses all our information. Facebook doesn't like being questioned about this, but it's sometimes outed gay youngsters to their parents, identified psychiatric patients and gone back on its word about how it uses telephone numbers and other data. Repeated misuse of our most personal details proves these companies need some checks on their power, and only Europe has shown much interest. Sure, Europe's fines against Google in this area have been paltry. But they'll go up under new rules, with Vestager taking a keen interest in how competition law and personal data overlaps. Alphabet and Facebook might not like pesky European ideas such as the right to kill erroneous Google searches or your old Facebook account, but customers would prefer to retain that power and ultimately, that's what business is here for, right? To serve the consumer. Competition Vestager has filed charges against Google's alleged favoring of its own services over rivals in search results, and is working on a separate Android inquiry. These lumbering cases may have limited impact given the pace of technology change and ubiquity of Google. Yet Vestager's attentions should encourage the search giant to avoid the pitfall that derailed earlier cousins, namely focusing too much on old-tech dominance. Take Microsoft and Intel. A decade ago, they were embroiled in long antitrust cases in Europe. Their effort to protect their old cash cows helps explain why they missed out on the biggest change to computing in a generation: the shift to mobile. European Vacation Facebook has more users in Europe than it does in the U.S. and Canada, but the company generates twice as much revenue from its home market Source: Facebook filings Note: Revenue is in millions of dollars, and is for the quarter ended June 30. Of course, Europe still does dumb stuff. On Wednesday, the Commission proposed some unworkable copyright reforms, including giving news publishers the right to demand payment from websites who display snippets of stories. Such measures have failed in countries where they've been tried and won't fix publishers' flawed online strategies. Perhaps, though, Silicon Valley will one day thank (or at least tolerate) Europe for its activism. It's easy to sniff at the social mission behind some of Brussels' actions. But there are business benefits hidden here too, which would ultimately be good for the web giants. Just like eating one's vegetables.

AMP stands for ‘Accelerated Mobile Pages’ and is a new format adopted by Google to deliver extra-fast pages for mobile browsers, delivered from the Alphabet Server. Google announced its intentions to expand the range of content that’s supported in AMP by the end of the year, meaning super-quick versions of non-news pages will start appearing in search results. Read on to discover more about what implications this has and what you need to about it, or refresh your knowledge about the basics of AMP. Who is it for? Apart from mobile users (obviously), the initial tests were done with a selection of news providers. User testing results proved so impressive that Google quickly opened the ‘experiments’ out to a live environment, offering any site the chance to develop AMP versions of their news and blog content. AMP news results currently get their own little carousel at the top of search engine result pages (SERPs): But soon, it’s going to be for everybody. Google has a demo available for mobile devices (or desktops running mobile emulators), although results are still heavily news-orientated: AMP - the essential questions Should you be using AMP? News providers If you provide news content, have a blog, or any sort of static information page, you should really be looking to implement AMP. Google is pushing heavily for the initiative, due to the high levels of interest. Maintaining or increasing organic visibility could be difficult if your competitors are using AMP and you are not. High mobile traffic If you have a large mobile audience segment, you should be considering what content may work better with AMP delivery: Are there pages or content sections that are more popular on the website? Do pages have a high bounce rate or low conversion for mobile users? Is it disruptive for the business or a user to get this content delivered by Google? What uplift could be achieved from better interaction with mobile customers? Assessing these questions will give an idea of the cost vs the benefit of converting content sections into AMP versions, or recreating site categories in the AMP format. Competitor space The SERPs environment is likely to change and feature better visibility for AMP results (regardless of whether this becomes a ranking factor in the future. Google states it currently isn’t). The chance of appearing in useful positions is reduced if competitors are using AMP content to push down other organic results. Customer fit What is the experience like for your mobile customers? Given that mobile-friendly sites do not always perform very quickly (check your site performance here), providing relevant content in AMP format might be a better experience for your customers. What content formats will be covered? Example pages show basic (but functional) e-commerce sites and eBay recently announced it was using AMP to speed up its mobile site and was collaborating with Google on ‘other features.’ It’s likely that many of the current content types that can be supported by rich snippets and structured data might lend themselves to AMP display. Items such as locations, organisations, recipes and events feed nicely into Google’s philosophy of ‘ micro moments’, which are frequently things you need in a hurry, on the go and on a mobile device. Shopping does present a problem – the functionality needs to be much simpler and pass users out of the AMP environment to transact. However, user uptake could show a preference for simplified, reduced shopping areas that load faster, especially in countries where high speed mobile networks are not widespread. There’s also a growing trend for using smart pay features on phones. So, it wouldn’t be a huge leap to expect the first AMP e-commerce store to use Google Wallet to plug this transactional gap. What developments are planned for AMP? There is a development roadmap for AMP which includes better functionality for tracking, split testing and rich media. Given that AMP can embed video, but media files can still take time to load, it wouldn’t be surprising if Google found a way of supercharging YouTube delivery. There have already been amendments to include better accessibility from user feedback; Google is likely to use client applications as a live test to see what works, what’s useful and what isn’t. How do I get started with AMP? Both WordPress and Drupal provide themes, plugins and modules for AMP content, so if you run those platforms you won’t have to fiddle with too much code. For others, there’s a defined set of requirements and examples, and Google have indicated they will be providing additional support using the #AMPlify hashtag over the ‘next few weeks’ on top of its usual help and feedback on Google Webmasters. Ultimately, if you are curious about AMP, the wisest approach would be to test AMP versions of content and see what works best with your audience and users Pros and Cons of using AMP Advantages Speed – The primary advantage of AMP is the speed. AMP uses a stripped-down format and mobile users get content delivered blisteringly fast – without the usual scripts and styling that takes time to deliver over mobile connections, and struggles with rendering on different handsets. AMP pages are four times faster and generally load in less than a second. Improved CTR – There’s been good feedback from the majority of publishers who participated in the project stating that click-through rates and ad views were higher on AMP pages. This follows Google’s general assertion that faster pages make happier users (who are more inclined to do click or take an action). Fast adoption – Google is getting behind this in a big way, with all that their immense market share implies. 4 million AMP pages are being added every week, and it’s likely that following the general content roll-out, there will be a variety of SERP display tests giving extra visibility to the new AMP content formats (much as we currently see with constant testing of Knowledge Graph and information panels). Disadvantages Traffic and authority – AMP content is brick walled on Google’s servers, meaning that users reading AMP content may not have to visit the originating publisher. This places more content within Google’s territory on the web, and, in turn, gives them more authority to declare what can and can’t be used (such as which advertising networks that are supported). This follows similar criticism of Knowledge Graph offering ‘instant answers’ in SERPs, ensuring that users never have to move out of a Google environment to get information on their queries. When this extends to other forms of content and e-commerce in AMP, more customer behaviour will be captured in Google’s environment, and not the brand’s. Doubtless this will assist Google’s bottom line in monetising ads and tracking search behaviour, but not necessarily provide the same value for the site producing AMP content. Developers too, are piqued at Google advocating a different HTML format that backtracks on accessibility and responsive design standards. It’s already possible to create fast mobile pages by sacrificing unnecessary scripting and styling, but AMP now provides a separate path (along with Facebook Instant Articles and Apple News) that diverges from universal, standard development. Your AMP next steps Formulate an AMP strategy plan If you are a news/opinion/blog content provider and don’t have AMP content, you need to start; others have a significant head start and the initial Google testing results are largely favourable Define the extent of your mobile audience and their engagement with your site. Benchmark performance and identify content and pages to test as AMP versions Identify content and features on your site that are useful for mobile customers for potential AMP formatting Assess business impact if this audience stays in Google rather than clicks through to your site Talk to us if you need to get more tailored advice or assistance from our expert specialists Share this post Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus Messaging Apps, Google Analytics and Dark Social Digital Marketing Apprentices - What We've Learned So Far (Part 3) Search blog Search Search Join in...

Muhammad Haniv, head of the specials cases branch in the tax office, said Google's refusal to cooperate after it was sent a letter in April requesting to be allowed to examine the company's tax reports had raised suspicions. He told a news conference that the probe would not be launched until the end of the month at the earliest. PT Google Indonesia, incorporated in 2011, said it was complying with the government. "We continue to cooperate fully with local authorities and pay all applicable taxes," a Google Indonesia spokesman said in an emailed response to questions. The government had also asked to examine the tax reports of the Indonesian offices of three other U.S. Internet based companies - Yahoo, Twitter and Facebook . Those three companies have complied, officials said. Yahoo and Google have formed Indonesian limited liability companies, while Twitter and Facebook operate branches of their Asia-Pacific offices in Indonesia. The government believes these companies owe income and value added tax on billions of dollars of revenue they generate from advertising in Indonesia, the tax office said. Haniv said Google's Indonesian entity was only allocated around 4 percent of the total revenues generated from the country, and it was this amount that was taxed, which he described as too small and "unfair". The communications ministry had estimated the value of digital advertising in Indonesia at about $800 million last year. The ministry said all of it was untaxed. There was no immediate explanation for the wide discrepancy of the two agencies' estimates for digital advertising revenue. Indonesia is facing a sizeable revenue shortfall this year as the resource-rich country can no longer rely on commodity-related income. In a separate development, the tax office said it is checking whether Ford Motor Co had avoided paying appropriate taxes, after a local newspaper reported that the U.S. car maker modified imported Everest model vehicles sold in Indonesia to pay a lower tax rate. If the car maker is proven to have caused state losses, it may have to pay back taxes of up to four times the amount it owed, according to Indonesian law. "We have always strictly complied with all Indonesia government regulations and policy, including all import-related tax and customs requirements, related to each of our Ford vehicles officially marketed and sold in the country," a Ford spokesman said. Ford announced in January it is closing all operations in Southeast Asia's biggest economy, where it held less than a 1 percent market share.

By Charlie Osborne for Between the Lines | September 15, 2016 -- 09:44 GMT (02:44 PDT) | Topic: Google Members of the public can now explore 10 Downing Street London after the traditional home of the British Prime Minister has remained off-limits to tourists for so long. While you may not be able to physically walk the halls or fondle the ornaments, you can, at least, wander around the buildings' rooms and halls thanks to a new partnership between the UK government and Google. As reported by the Telegraph, from today, online users can explore 10 Downing Street, the home of every PM since 1735. The house, the UK's equivalent to the White House in the United States, also acts as the PM's office and an entertainment area. The UK government says that key decisions have all taken place there, such as First and Second World War direction, the construction of the British nuclear bomb and the handling of economic crises such as the Great Depression in 1929. More recently the UK's new PM Theresa May has taken up residence at number 10 after the resignation of David Cameron following the Brexit vote. If users wish to explore the building and take in some of the history, they can now use Google Street View to wander down the halls, the Cabinet room, the Thatcher room -- used as Cameron's office -- and the gardens, among other areas. A look inside 10 Downing Street with Google... SEE FULL GALLERY 1 - 5 of 9 NEXT PREV Amit Sood, director of Google Arts and Culture commented: "We're delighted to be able to share our technology to open and promote the history behind another emblematic British institution. With more than 1000 institutions from 70 countries now preserving and sharing their content online, we hope to empower everyone to experience history, art and culture in new ways." Take a look at 10 Downing Street for yourself here. Google has used Street View cameras, usually mounted on cars to create digital maps of Earth, to capture images of monuments and places of public interest as part of the firm's Cultural Institute programs. Users can take virtual tours of areas including the American Museum of Natural History, Prambanan temple, Ford's Theatre and the National Theater of Korea.

Advertisement Description Technical Change Log Comments How To Browse Privately In Google Chrome Google’s game changing browser Chrome combines sophisticated technology with a simple UI, to create a faster, safer and easier browsing experience. Launched in 2008, Google Chrome quickly dominated the browser market to become the most used browser globally within 4 years of its public release. Google’s rapid and continuous development cycle ensures the browser continues to compete with the other most popular and advanced web browsers available. Speed Perhaps the area Google invested most of its development time to differentiate from other browsers. Google Chrome launches extremely quickly from your desktop, runs applications at speed thanks to a powerful JavaScript engine and loads pages rapidly using the WebKit open source rendering engine. Add to this quicker search and navigation options from the simplified UI and you have a browser that is pretty hard to beat on speed, especially if gaming is your thing. Clean, simple UI Google Chrome’s most striking feature and a substantial factor in its popularity - the simple UI hasn’t changed much since the beta launch in 2008. Google focused on trimming down unnecessary toolbar space to maximise browsing real estate. The browser is made up of 3 rows of tools, the top layer horizontally stacks automatically adjusting tabs, next to a simple new tabs icon and the standard minimize, expand & close windows controls. The middle row includes 3 navigation controls (Back, Forward & Stop/Refresh), a URL box which also allows direct Google web searching and a star bookmarking icon. Extensions and browser settings icons line up to the right of the URL box. The third row is made up of bookmark folders and installed apps. Easily overlooked now, this clean UI was a breath of fresh air compared to the overcrowded toolbars of popular browsers pre-2008. Privacy Another hugely popular feature, Incognito mode allows you to browse privately by disabling history recording, reducing traceable breadcrumbs and removing tracking cookies on shutdown. Chrome’s settings also allow you to customize regular browsing privacy preferences. Security Chrome’s Sandboxing prevents malware automatically installing on your computer or affecting other browser tabs. Chrome also has Safe Browsing technology built in with malware and phishing protection that warns you if you encounter a website suspected of containing malicious software/activity. Regular automatic updates ensure security features are up to date and effective. Customization A vast selection of apps, extensions, themes and settings make your browsing experience unique to you. Improve productivity, security, navigation speed, pretty much anything you can think of with apps and extensions from the Google Chrome Store. Install themes created by top artists or make your own using mychrometheme.com.

Two of the practices it identified, restricting payment methods developers can accept and preventing the use of virtual currencies between apps, could violate Japan's anti-monopoly law, the advisory panel said in a report. "We should monitor the situation," the report said. "If the competition regulator judges certain actions to be illegal, they should take firm legal measures in response." Apple and Google officials were not immediately available for comment. Anti-trust violations have become a sensitive issue for U.S. technology companies after the European Union accused Google in April of using its Android mobile operating system to block competitors, which could carry a fine of up to $7.4 billion. The METI panel report looked at how the two U.S. technology giants, as well as others that control platforms through which smartphone applications are sold, use their positions of power to decide what app developers can and cannot do. Japan's government has placed renewed focus on the technology industry after Prime Minister Shinzo Abe made investment in cutting edge technology a central part of his economic growth strategy.

ADVERTISEMENT The Prime Minister's residence – currently occupied by Theresa May – has been opened up to those wanting to get a glimpse inside the walls of the 332-year-old building. Every prime minister since 1735 has lived inside the building designed by Christopher Wren, and the doors to the building are rarely opened to cameras. Google's Street View cameras were used to capture nine areas of the building. These include the Thatcher Room, the Anterroom (covered with images of the Queen), and the entrance hall, which mysteriously has a painting blurred on the right-hand side. (WIRED contacted Downing Street which clarified the image is blurred for copyright reasons).

In one of the most detailed speeches he has given on the economy since becoming Labour leader, he linked the vote in the EU referendum with his longstanding belief that neoliberal economics are failing by claiming that the leave vote was a “decisive rejection” of the status quo. The current system meant “poverty pay, zero-hours contracts and lives ruined by a shortage of affordable homes”. Corbyn said that people could no longer rely on free trade and free markets alone to deliver prosperity. Our heavily-indebted societies are more vulnerable to financial shocks than they were. All of this presents a deep challenge to the social democratic and socialist tradition that Labour, New or Old, has always been a part of. It punctures the old belief that it was possible simply to redistribute the proceeds a growing economy to pay for public services. It can no longer credibly be argued, for the majority of people, that free trade and free markets alone will deliver increased prosperity. Corbyn said that governments all over the world were becoming more interventionist and he said it was “unpardonable folly” for the Tories to press ahead with cuts. Giving several examples of how this might happen, he said Labour would focus on investment. This would involve a new approach to enforcing free market rules, he went on, singling out EU state aid rules as a particular issue. Any deal with the EU must recognise that the old state aid rules are no longer valid. When governments across the world are intervening, it makes no sense to tie a government’s hands here. Later, in response to a question, Corbyn said that he was not saying Britain should reject a trade deal with the EU after Brexit if it involved accepting state aid rules; he just wanted Britain to be able to adopt a flexible approach to state aid, as Germany, France and Italy seem to be allowed to do, he said. But he did say that under Labour the government would insist on using British steel for infrastructure projects. John McDonnell has said the Corbyn team has apologised for the release of the list of anti-Corbyn MPs. (See 2.46pm.) Damian Green, the work and pensions secretary, has announced that “supported accommodation” will be exempt from housing benefit cuts. The exemption will last until 2019, at which point a new funding model will ensure that the sector continues to be funded at current levels, he said. “Supported accommodation” is housing for vulnerable people with particular needs, like people with learning disabilities or addiction problems or women seeking refuge from domestic violence, and campaigners have been arguing for months that, without an exemption from the housing benefit cuts, many of these establishments could be forced to close.

Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 9.46am EDT 09:46 Corbyn and McDonnell's Q&A - Summary Here are the key Labour-related points from the Q&A. I will post a separate summary from the speech later, taking in replies to the speech-related questions. Jeremy Corbyn said he was confident he would have a “full team” of shadow ministers in place after the leadership election. At the moment dozens of shadow ministerial posts remain unfilled because so many MPs resigned, but Corbyn said that the party was now “coming together” and he implied that shadow frontbenchers who resigned would come back. I’m very keen on providing olive branches, and indeed a number of olive branches have been offered to me. As a practical start for this I’m growing an olive tree on the balcony of my office and it’s doing very, very well. It’s thriving. So I’m very confident we are as a party coming together. And I’m obviously having discussions with lots of colleagues. And there will be a full team in place to take on this government and provide very effective opposition. John McDonnell said the Corbyn team has apologised for the release of the list of anti-Corbyn MPs. Asked if it was right to release it, he said: We will be meeting with all our MPs on any of the issues of concern to them, of course we will. That release came from the campaign. It didn’t come from Jeremy. And we’ve apologised. It was just inappropriate. One of our researchers saw a bit of incoming flak and then did a list of all the statements that have been made by other MPs, some of which were not particularly kind, let’s put it that way. It was a briefing note. It shouldn’t have gone out. And we apologised for that. It certainly was not a list in any way to attack anyone. It was just a factual report. McDonnell said that he was “absolutely furious” about the release of the list because the Corbyn team are “rebuilding relations” with Corbyn’s critics. He says almost the whole PLP (parliamentary Labour party) backed Corbyn’s stance in PMQs yesterday on grammar schools. He said: The thing about last night, that going out, it just set us back. And I was furious about that, to be frank, absolutely furious. And just at a time when we were rebuilding relations. I hope it hasn’t set us back. And we will certainly have a conversation with all those involved. Corbyn said he never resorted to using abusive comments himself. I, as you know, never abuse anybody, tempting as it sometimes is. And I don’t respond to unkind remarks that I understand are sometimes thrown in my direction because I believe politics is far too important for that. McDonnell insisted that a comment he was recorded making in 2013 saying that as Marxist he approved of the financial crash was a joke. It was a joke. I think I also said the bankers have done more to undermine capitalism than anything the SWP have done in the last 40 years. I think it was taken as a joke and, if you listen to the tape, people fell about laughing as a result. John McDonnell.

Do you want full EEA membership? Corbyn says he has been clear that environmental and worker protection issues are very important. They should be included in UK law. He is also very clear that the UK has a very close economic relationship with Europe. There has to be an agreement on market access, he says. Hopefully that will be part of a single market? He says Emily Thornberry has meetings in Europe on this. And he is meeting Martin Shulz, the president of the European parliament, next week, he says. Q: Are you happy with the Hinkley Point decision? And what do you think of the preferential share idea? McDonnell says he has not seen the detail. He says Labour think the finances are disappointing. But they also want to maximise the chances of getting British jobs. And that’s it. I will post a summary shortly. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 8.59am EDT 08:59 Q: You say any single market deal must recognise state intervention. Does that mean Labour MPs would veto a Brexit deal if it maintained state aid rules? Corbyn says this government has used state aid rules defensively. But other EU governments have not felt themselves constrained by state aid rules. Whatever relationship we have with the EU, we must not sign up to something that constrains governments, he says. He wants the UK to be able to have a strong manufacturing base like Germany and France. McDonnell says this would not be a deal breaker. He says Labour just wants the same flexibilities that other countries have exercised. Q: Are you confident that Labour MPs will return to the front bench if you win the leadership?

A full team will be in place. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 8.52am EDT 08:52 Corbyn says he never abuses anyone.

They drew up a list to make the point that Corbyn’s opponents have been harsh too. He says he wants the party to come together. He says he was “furious” about the list because it set the Corbyn team back. McDonnell apologises for the release of the list of anti-Corbyn MPs.

Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 8.47am EDT 08:47 Corbyn confirms his interest in a universal basic income. And he proposed a right to own for workers. Labour will look to create a “Right to Own”, giving workers facing a change of ownership or closure of a firm the first refusal in putting together a worker-owned alternative. The regional development banks will be given the task … alongside assisting small businesses generally … of providing the finance to make worker ownership and co-operative ownership a reality across our economy. I want to see local councils building on the example of Preston, where a focus on using local government procurement … has helped support the local economy with real investment and sustain co-operative local enterprises. But we can go further than this … I want to see a new, co-operatively owned ‘British Mittelstand’ created: high-investment, high-productivity smaller firms that provide high-quality employment in those sectors where we have the greatest potential: digital technology, healthcare, high-value added manufacturing. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 8.45am EDT 08:45 Corbyn says the rich need to pay more tax. Senior members of my party used to say they were, and I quote: “intensely relaxed about people getting filthy rich as long as they pay their taxes”. The problem was that while those in my party were relaxing many of those “filthy rich” were not paying the taxes they should have been. Instead, I want to be relaxed in the knowledge that our fellow citizens are living rich lives, and for our economy to be working for people. And not working against them. And he says he would look at measures to curb executive pay. Oxfam has raised the issue of pay ratios this week and should not be ignored by politicians. This is something I am extremely interested in and we’ll be looking at ways to address the huge disparity in executive pay compared to ordinary workers.

The issues are affecting the company’s Google for Work productivity suite, with users complaining they’re unable to access their emails at all and instructing people to get in touch via phone or Twitter instead. Google first acknowledged the problem on its Apps Status Dashboard at 8:16am Pacific Time (1.16am AEST) on Wednesday, stating that it is investigating reports of an issue with Gmail. “Based on reports, it affects only Google for Work Gmail users,” Google said. Affected users were redirected to a page with ‘Service not available, contact your administrator.’ More than 14 hours later “Gmail service has already been restored for some users, and we expect a resolution for all users in the near future. Please note this time frame is an estimate and may change. “Delivery of messages sent to affected users during the issue may be delayed.” Google also said it identified the root cause of the issue and was implementing a potential fix, but as of 5.30pm AEST it’s still experiencing issues. Employees of some Australian companies complained about the disruption to their workdays on Twitter. Google has recently increased efforts to sell its products to corporate customers, including its productivity tools, like Gmail and Google Docs, as well as its cloud-computing service. Some employees of The Australian were affected. Google didn’t immediately respond to a request for additional comment. With Dow Jones. Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on email Share more...

Here’s how by Sean Keach 15 September 2016 0 shares Read Comments Check out 10 Downing Street on Street View for the first time ever Ever wanted to have a nose around the Prime Minister’s house? Well now you can… Google has finally snapped the interior of 10 Downing Street for Street View, opening up the hallowed Prime ministerial residence on the service for the first time ever. Starting today, you’ll be able to tour the 332-year-old building, which is (unsurprisingly) generally closed to the public. Using Street View, you can check out areas like the Thatcher Room, the Cabinet room, and even the rose garden, as they were in January 2016. Check it out: Click here for 10 Downing Street on Google Street View The actual Downing Street road first arrived on Google Street View back in 2012, giving users a glimpse of the Prime Minister’s famous front door. The White House is also available to view on Street View, with the interior on show via Google Art. Interestingly, although 10 Downing Street has technically been home to every Prime Minister since 1735, it’s not actually occupied by current UK Prime Minister Theresa May. Due to the size of her family, she’s swapped with Philip Hammond, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, who would normally reside in Number 11. It follows a precedent first set by Tony Blair in 1997, and one followed by David Cameron in 2010.

Sep, 09:29 Google was in the firing line when the European Commission on Wednesday (14 September) laid out plans for how to fix the EU’s outmoded copyright rules. As part of the package, the EU executive suggested levelling the playing field between media on the one hand, and search engines and news aggregators on the other, by giving the first group special publishers’ rights.

Similar schemes backfired in Germany and Spain (Photo: Alessio Milan) This means that platforms could have to pay for hosting stories, or even snippets - headlines, accompanying pictures, quotes and introductory sentences - in future. Publishers’ groups EMMA, ENPA, EPC and NME welcomed the news as ”a necessary and historically important step in guaranteeing media pluralism as an essential basis for freedom of opinion and democracy in the digital world”. They said all other players in the creative industries enjoyed similar rights already. The current framework dates back to just 2001, but many say it was fit for the past century when reporting the news was still profitable. The advent of Internet went hand in hand with falling ad revenues. The groups said publishers contributed to the success of platforms by providing high quality content, but that platforms did not share their profits fairly. 'Value gap' Artists have long had similar concerns. They say more people are listening to music than ever, but this is not reflected in performers’ income. This is partly blamed on Google’s sister company YouTube. The commission’s proposal would make it mandatory for video platforms to put programmes in place that scan users' content for protected material. Such material is today removed only after individual complaints, and, in many cases, is reposted under a different username almost immediately afterward. The EU executive also wants to increase transparency in the sector by forcing platforms to provide better figures on their profits vis-a-vis use of copyrighted material, so that it becomes clear how much money they are making on artists and reporters’ content. The European Grouping of Societies of Authors and Composers (Gesac) called the proposal ”Europe’s first step to end tech giant free riding”. But not everyone agrees that press and music will be better off after a crackdown on Google. The US tech giant, whose motto is “don’t be evil”, does not like to be blamed for the demise of the newspaper business. It also says it does not actually make much money on news services. Today’s headlines - capsized refugee boats, economic woes - do not attract many accompanying adverts, it says. The US company said in a blog post the EU executive had not “struck the right balance” between the rights of creators and consumers. "This would effectively turn the internet into a place where everything uploaded to the web must be cleared by lawyers before it can find an audience," Google’s vice president Caroline Atkinson wrote. She warned the move could prevent competition from small-scale actors. The firm noted that YouTube has spent €53 million to create the software that recognises and removes copyright content. Google also voiced criticism over the way the commission wanted to support news publishers. The proposal looks a lot like previous ones that failed in Germany and Spain. German lawmakers introduced an ancillary copyright for publishers in 2013, under which they could ask search engines and aggregators a licence fee for links to their articles if such links were accompanied by short snippets of the publishers’ content. Google said it would continue to display results from these sites, but without any text and image snippets, so as to not violate the new law. Risk of fiasco Some websites saw traffic drop by up to 80 percent as a consequence. Eventually 90 percent of the news websites waived their rights to the US company. Spain, on the other hand, made it mandatory to pay for snippets, which had Google close down its news service in the country. According to Google’s own figures, that effort cost publishers a loss of 6 percent of traffic in average - but 14 percent for smaller publishers, which depended more heavily on the search engine for audience. ”Paying to display snippets is not a viable option for anyone”, Google’s Caroline Atkinson wrote. The EU consumers lobby, Beuc, was also critical of plans to oblige online platforms to install software to detect and take down videos containing parts of copyrighted works.  “Many people remix, produce and share videos and music on a daily basis. Because of unclear copyright rules they face the risk that their creations are taken down by the likes of YouTube and Facebook,” Beuc director general Monique Goyens wrote in an emailed statement.  She said the proposal to make scanning for copyrighted content mandatory would lead to removal of allegedly unauthorised content.  ”This measure is legitimising the arbitrary removal of consumers’ own creative works. This is not how the web should work for online users,” Doyens said.  The European Parliament’s rapporteur on copyright, Julia Reda, likewise poured criticism on the commission. She called the plans a ”disaster for the Internet”. Backfire risk ”The commission clearly targeted Google,” said the German Pirate, who sits with the Green group, ”but it could end up hurting its competitors instead.” ”Publishers seem to have convinced [EU digital economy] commissioner Oettinger that Google makes a lot of money, and that they should have a part of that money,” Reda told this website. The news industry’s troubles would not be solved with copyright law, she said. Even the commission’s own impact assessment revealed that news publishers expected at best a 10 percent boost to their revenues. Reda said that she feared people would simply stop linking to those stories protected by the new right. ”That would hurt European news business and media diversity,” the Pirate said. She said German media eventually waived their rights for Google, “but they kept it for competitors”. Despite the war of words, the proposal does not hammer out details of a deal to be concluded between Google and news publishers. It creates a right for the publisher, who does not have to use it. The ball now passes to the European Parliament and the Council, which will amend and vote on the proposals before they become law.

Now, the smartphone is set for release in a few weeks. The Phab 2 Pro features 6.4-inch Quad-HD (2,560x1,440p) IPS display, Qualcomm Snapdragon 652 (Tango Edition) SoC processor, a 64GB internal memory with microSD card slot, a 4GB RAM and a 16MP camera. Why advertise with us? For most people, its internal hardware might make it appear as just another mid-range phone, but its capabilities are awe-inspiring. The Phab 2 Pro is the world's first smartphone to include Tango —an advance mobile technology from Google that enables augmented reality (AR) gaming and utilities. Project Tango has been under testing for more than three years. Google's pet smartphone project is the brainchild of ATAP (Advanced Technology and Projects), a former division of Motorola Mobility that has now been acquired by Lenovo.

By providing the first free global view of commercial fishing*, Global Fishing Watch delivers a powerful and unprecedented tool that can help to rebuild fish stocks and protect our oceans, which are threatened by global overfishing, illegal fishing and habitat destruction. The announcement was made in conjunction with the Our Ocean Conference in Washington, D.C., an international gathering of ocean leaders hosted by Secretary of State John Kerry. The product of a partnership between Oceana, SkyTruth and Google, Global Fishing Watch is an intuitive and free interactive online tool that shows the apparent fishing activity of 35,000 (and counting) commercial fishing vessels operating throughout the world. The platform is regularly updated to show vessel tracks and fishing activity from January 1, 2012 through three days prior to present time. By sharing this critical information publically for the first time, Global Fishing Watch will have immeasurable and wide-ranging positive impacts on ocean health. From allowing fishery managers to better understand and manage fishing activity in their waters to aiding enforcement agencies in deterring illegal fishing, Global Fishing Watch is a powerful tool to help restore our oceans. “Global Fishing Watch will revolutionize the way the world views commercial fishing,” said Jacqueline Savitz, Vice President for the United States and Global Fishing Watch at Oceana. “Now, in the hands of everyone, this free tool can be used by governments, journalists, citizens, researchers and the seafood industry. It will allow governments to track suspicious vessels, enforce rules and reduce seafood fraud. Journalists and everyday citizens will be able to identify behavior that may be related to illegal fishing or overfishing. Global Fishing Watch is a powerful tool in the fight against illegal fishing and has tremendous potential to preserve and protect our world’s delicate marine ecosystem for generations to come.” Global Fishing Watch uses public broadcast data from the Automatic Identification System (AIS), collected by satellite and terrestrial receivers, to show the movement of vessels over time. Every day, more than 20 million data points are added to AIS. Global Fishing Watch uses this information to track vessel movement and classify it as “fishing” or “non-fishing” activity. “Working with Oceana and Google has enabled us to take a good idea and build it into something that will improve the lives of hundreds of millions of people around the planet,” said John Amos, President and Founder of SkyTruth. “Global Fishing Watch will catalyze the science, policy-making and public pressure necessary to make our oceans sustainable.” Global Fishing Watch is collaborating with governments, private industry, and scientific and international agencies to enable additional transparency and sustainability policies. Indonesia, a leader in fisheries reform and management, has committed to making all of their registered fishing vessels with trackers public to the world through the platform because they believe so strongly in transparency. Trace Register, the leading traceability solution provider for the global seafood industry, is working with Global Fishing Watch to enable its customers to verify that their seafood was legally and responsibly produced. Armed with new global datasets and access to massive cloud computing resources, leading scientific institutions around the world are collaborating in the Global Fishing Watch Research Program to model economic, environmental, policy and climate change implications on fisheries. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations is exploring new methodologies to more accurately report global vessel registries and fishery statistics and will be proposing transparency tools to support States in improving their monitoring, control and surveillance of fishing activities. “While many of the environmental trends in the ocean can be sobering, the combination of cloud computing, machine learning, and massive data is enabling new tools to visualize, understand and potentially reverse these trends,” said Brian Sullivan, Sr. Program Manager at Google Ocean & Earth Outreach. “We are excited to contribute a Google-scale approach toward ocean sustainability and public awareness.” Funding partners for Global Fishing Watch include the Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation, Marisla Foundation, Bloomberg Philanthropies, The Wyss Foundation, The Waterloo Foundation and Adessium Foundation.

As AIS data varies in completeness, accuracy and quality, it is possible that some fishing activity is not identified and conversely, that some fishing activity identified is not fishing. For these reasons, Global Fishing Watch qualifies all designations of vessel fishing activity, including synonyms of the term “fishing activity,” such as “fishing” or “fishing effort,” as “apparent,” rather than certain. Any/all Global Fishing Watch information about “apparent fishing activity” should be considered an estimate and must be relied upon solely at your own risk. Global Fishing Watch is taking steps to make sure fishing activity designations are as accurate as possible.

The app has been downloaded more than 500,000 times, with at least 6,000 successful infections. Kaspersky Lab has reported the Trojan to Google and the app has been removed from Google Play. The global phenomenon of Pokémon Go has resulted in a growing number of related apps and, inevitably, increased interest from the cybercriminal community. Kaspersky Lab’s analysis of the “Guide for Pokémon Go” Trojan has uncovered malicious code that downloads rooting malware, securing access to the core Android OS for the purposes of app installation and removal as well as the display of advertising. The Trojan includes some interesting features that help it to bypass detection. For example, it doesn’t start as soon as the victim launches the app. Instead, it waits for the user to install or uninstall another app, and then checks to see whether that app runs on a real device or on a virtual machine. If it’s dealing with a device, the Trojan will wait a further two hours before starting its malicious activity. Even then, infection is not guaranteed. After connecting with its command server and uploading details of the infected device, including country, language, device model and OS version, the Trojan will wait for a response. Only if it hears back will it proceed with further requests and the downloading, installation and implementation of additional malware modules. This approach means that the control server can stop the attack from proceeding if it wants to – skipping those users it does not wish to target, or those which it suspects are a sandbox/virtual machine, for example. This provides an additional layer of protection for the malware. Once rooting rights have been enabled, the Trojan will install its modules into the device’s system folders, silently installing and uninstalling other apps and displaying unsolicited ads to the user. Kaspersky Lab analysis shows that at least one other version of the malicious Pokémon Guide app was available through Google Play in July 2016. Further, researchers have tracked back at least nine other apps infected with the same Trojan and available on Google Play Store at different times since December 2015. Kaspersky Lab’s data suggests that there have been just over 6,000 successful infections to date, including in Russia, India and Indonesia. However, since the app is oriented towards English-speaking users, people in such geographies, and more, are also likely to have been hit. “In the online world, wherever the consumers go, the cybercriminals will be quick to follow. Pokémon Go is no exception. Victims of this Trojan may, at least at first, not even notice the increase in annoying and disruptive advertising, but the long term implications of infection could be far more sinister. If you’ve been hit, then someone else is inside your phone and has control over the operating system and everything you do and store on it. Even though the app has now been removed from the store, there’s up to half a million people out there vulnerable to infection – and we hope this announcement will alert them to the need to take action,” said Roman Unuchek, Senior Malware Analyst, Kaspersky Lab. People concerned that they may encounter the Trojan should install a reliable security solution, such as Kaspersky Internet Security for Android, on their device. If the security scan shows that they are already infected, the best way to remove the rooting malware is to backup all data and reset the device to factory settings. In addition, Kaspersky Lab advises users to always check that apps have been created by a reputable developer, to keep their operating system and application software up-to-date, and not to download anything that looks at all suspicious or whose source cannot be verified.

By Hyacinth Mascarenhas September 15, 2016 08:01 BST A rogue and malicious Android app billing itself as a 'Guide for Pokémon Go' has been downloaded more than half a million times from the Google Play StoreReuters/Tyrone Siu About half a million Pokémon Go players were duped into downloading a rogue and malicious Android app masquerading as a "Guide for Pokémon Go" that was available for download on the Google Play store until recently. Kaspersky Lab researchers estimate that the phony app managed to successfully infect at least 6,000 victims' phones with the malicious malware before it was removed from the Google Play Store after researchers reported it. "In the past few months, almost six million people gave Pokémon Go a try," Kaspersky Lab's Kate Kochetkova wrote in a blog post published 14 September. "It's no wonder that the massively popular game quickly caught the attention of cybercriminals." Researchers found that the latest Trojan - HEUR:Trojan.AndroidOS.Ztorg.ad - included malicious code that rooted victims' devices and installed various other malicious files and unwanted apps. After a user installed the app, the malware remained dormant for a while in order to determine whether it was on a real phone or a virtual machine used by security experts to look for viruses. Once confirmed that it was on a real device, the Trojan then sent a message over to the cybercriminials who created it with detailed information about the infected device such as the model, OS version, default language, country and more. After the information was analysed and the victim was deemed suitable enough to meet their needs, the cybercriminal could then order the app to install hidden software to root the system, covertly install other unwanted apps and flood the user's phone with ads. The rogue 'Guide for Pokémon Go' app was downloaded over 500,000 times, researchers saidKaspersky Lab "Advertisements are rarely pleasant," Kochetkova writes. "It's one thing to watch ads from Google... It's quite another thing when criminals infect your phone with malware to display banners all the time. "However, the worst part of this infection is hidden: Guide for Pokémon Go can secretly install any apps on your device. For now, criminals have chosen a relatively mild way to earn money: ads. Tomorrow, they may decide to increase their income by locking your device and demanding ransom - or stealing money from your bank account." Prior to its removal from the store, researchers said the Trojan targeted users from English-speaking regions and infected devices in Russia, India and Indonesia among others. They also noted that at least one other version of the app in question was available through the Google Play Store in July, shortly after the wildly popular augmented reality game was released. At least nine other apps on the Google Play Store were also found to be infected with the same Trojan module at different times since December 2015 - including a "Digital Clock" app that garnered over 100,000 downloads. Since its release in early July, Pokémon Go has swept the globe, encouraging millions of users to explore their surroundings and capture pocket monsters via their smartphones. Although the initial hype surrounding the hit mobile game seems to have died down, app analysis firm SensorTower reported that the game pulled in over an estimated $440m (£330.9m) with developer Niantic garnering a net revenue of more than $308m so far. The GPS-powered game still continues to rake in over an estimated $4m in daily net revenue worldwide, the firm said.

The new versions of the company’s email apps will soon come with a design that would enable content to adapt to smartphones regardless of screen size. “Starting later this month, Gmail and Inbox by Gmail will support emails created with responsive design, meaning their content adapts to fit screens of all sizes,” Google said on its official Gmail blog. “Texts, links, and even buttons will enlarge to make reading and tapping easier on a smaller screen.” Responsive design for emails shown for the Inbox by Google app. Photo: Google Viewing emails on smartphones can sometimes be a headache. There are times when texts are just too small to read and links are harder to tap. This is because emails are still formatted to be viewed on larger computer screens. Related Stories Hackers Can Win $200,000 In Google's New Contest Nearly Half Of Americans ‘Very Concerned’ About Clinton Emails Google’s update for Gmail and Inbox is intended to resolve these issues by enabling all of its emails to adapt to all types of screen sizes. When this update rolls out, emails should automatically be formatted to fit exactly on the user’s smartphone screen, and users won’t have to zoom in or out to read texts or to tap on any buttons or links. This new responsive design for emails is also the same on how people view content on desktop/laptop computers. For example, changing the size of a browser’s window will prompt the webpage to automatically adjust the format of the page to make it more comfortable for people to view content. Google isn’t only bring improvements to its email apps as the company has promised to bring the some improvements to desktop versions. After all, emails formatted for mobile already look better on computers. Although Google is making an effort to make sure emails are easier to view on mobile devices, this update won’t affect all emails, as pointed out by The Next Web. The new responsive design will only apply to emails that look like small webpages (i.e. website newsletters).

Define your site main menu Escaping The Walled Gardens In The Clouds After going through a bunch of OS X Mountain Lion reviews I have to say I can’t wait to get it onto my Mac. For the most part the devil’s in the details; all the little things that accrue to form what I expect to be a better user experience. Besides all of the little things, however, there is something that increasingly defines what OS X is about: the iCloud. As Tim Cook said, Apple doubled down on iCloud with Mountain Lion, and it shows. Using Mountain Lion it will be hard to avoid it. TextEdit’s save dialog, for instance, offers iCloud document storage by default, a practice to be followed by other Apple applications and encouraged for third party apps as well. Then there are the Reminders, Notes, and Game Center, and a significant portion of their value is the fact that they seamlessly sync with their equivalents on the iPhone and the iPad. When we look at the trend of iCloud integration with OSX and iOS we could almost, similarly to what John Siracusa remarked, consider OSX and iOS as just clients to the iCloud. It’s beginning to feel like it is all just one big iCloud OS for the entire Apple world. But that’s just the thing that’s bothering me a little. It is the Apple world; it’s an exclusive club. I have a MacBook Pro, and that’s the only Apple device I own. I own an Android smartphone and a Windows PC. In this configuration much of the benefit of the iCloud fades away from me. The Notes app becomes just another notes app, since it’s super-seamless syncing with its iOS equivalent means nothing to me. Why can’t it sync to a compatible Android equivalent? Well, of course, I might as well ask why won’t pigs fly wearing icy necklaces in hell! It’s slightly entertaining to read John Siracusa espouse the greatness of the iCloud and how it makes life easier for its users, and seem so oblivious to the possibility that some Apple users might only own a Mac. It is as if he just assumes that everyone reading owns at least a Mac and an iPhone. This is all the more interesting when you consider the fact that his audience are supposed to be nerds; people who are far more likely to own Android phones at the same time as a Mac. People, you know, a little bit like me. But this is all just an introduction. Apple represents the best example of this “ecosystem-ism”, a trend that seems especially enabled by cloud computing. Everything is absolutely awesome so long as you don’t step out of the ecosystem, and when you look at their marketing they act as if nothing else in the world exists but their ecosystem. Their ecosystem is their entire reality. Of course you’ll have an iPhone! Why, you might even have an iPad! Isn’t it all just so obvious? It’s iCloud magic baby! You have to be all-in! But I’m not. I have a Mac, and an Android phone. I’m not all in, and that makes me feel like a black sheep in this vision of theirs. It makes me feel as if I should either just exit the entire Apple world, or go all in, drop my Android and buy an iPhone, and then an iPad, and then an Apple TV (hey, AirPlay mirroring!), and so on. Apple may be the best example of this game at play, but they’re far from the only ones. The other two big players, Google and Microsoft, are guilty of it as well. Google has its own little island. Actually, it’s not little, and it’s not an island. It’s more like an omnipresent matrix of nodes that are becoming ever more tightly knotted with each other as they squeeze the entire planet out of its advertising dollars. But seriously, if you look at the video of a simple little Google service like Google Tasks you will keep hearing and seeing about Google this and Google that. It integrates with Gmail, and Google Calendar, and Google Docs. It’s so great! Unless, perhaps, you kinda want to use your own calendar application, and just perhaps prefer Yahoo Mail or something. Will Tasks integrate with those? Probably not. Yet again we are pressed into a situation where everything is just so awesome, smooth and easy so long as you stick with their predefined paradigm. No mixing and matching for you. What about Microsoft? Well, it is easy to imagine a similarly tight integration between Windows 8 and Windows Phone, as well as the whole existing Windows Live and Xbox Live ecosystem. As Microsoft gets better at presenting this as a single coherent whole, much like Apple does (and that’s where I think they want to be heading), we’ll have a similar situation as with Apple and Google. So, it’s a world of silos, and if you expect the smoothest experience possible it seems you’re no longer choosing between specific operating systems or specific devices. You are choosing between entire frigging companies! Either you go all in with Apple, or all in with Google, or all in with Microsoft. Take your pick. If you, however, choose to mix and match between them then you have to concede to a possibly suboptimal, perhaps messier, user experience. And then you have to fight off the constant barrage of marketing speak that keeps trying to bring you in line with the ecosystem of the platform you are primarily using. It gives me the feeling as if I am somehow underutilizing OS X by not taking full advantage of the iCloud because I haven’t fully bought into the Apple’s ecosystem. Mixing and Matching Now, it’s really not so bad, and I’m not trying to paint this as some kind of a disaster. There are plenty of third party solutions out there which work pretty smoothly by themselves, and independently of the major ecosystems. For instance we have Simplenote, a cloud based note taking service which is compatible with a whole bunch of different note taking apps across all platforms. I am using Notational Velocity on my Mac, and Notational Acceleration on my Android. Both hook up to the Simplenote cloud for instant iCloud-like syncing of all notes I make on either the Mac or the Android. This makes me independent of all the big ecosystems for my note taking. It makes me feel like I have my own little ecosystem. Of course, the experience still isn’t as slick as the one with Apple Notes, at least with the Android app (and others are actually worse), so I guess I can count that as a penalty for daring to stray into the dirty world of third parties. Open Cross-Platform Universal Clouds However, this example does lead to an interesting idea. What if we had the smooth user experience of the big closed ecosystems, but independent of the big closed ecosystems? In such a scenario we have open clouds which developers can hook into for all the data piping necessary, and users can register and login with to store their data on, using any compatible application. Let’s call one such cloud OpenCloud. You would have an OpenCloud ID (much like the Apple ID), and could choose between multitude of OpenCloud compatible photo apps (for example) on any platform. You choose one on your Android phone, one on Windows PC, and one on the iPad. Input your OpenCloud login into all of them and your photos between all of these apps on all of these devices get synced much in the same manner as iCloud does between iPhoto on iPad and Mac. So yes, you take a picture on your Android phone and voila it appears on your Windows PC, and your iPad immediately, thanks to the magic of the OpenCloud. Similarly, if you add a picture to the app on your iPad, it automatically appears on Windows and Android equivalents. If you change the application on any of these devices to another OpenCloud compatible device it could either migrate the data from the old app or just interface with the data stored on the OpenCloud, taking over where the previous app left off. The big difference between this and the iCloud (or Google and Microsoft’s ecosystems), of course, is that it all just works across all platforms instead of just within the confines of a single ecosystem. You can mix and match applications, devices, and operating systems at your hearts content, essentially creating your own ecosystem. We could go even further and imagine multiple different open clouds all following a certain set of standards that allows them to sync between each other. They would compete in their performance, storage pricing etc. If you decide to use a different universal open cloud service there would be an easy way to migrate your data, and happily continue on with the new cloud. Such a cloud might be a kind of blend between what already exists. Simperium and Dropbox come to mind whereas Simperium offers a developer-facing piece of the puzzle (data piping magic), and Dropbox offers a user friendly storage box and data syncing. As John Siracusa explained in his OSX Mountain Lion mega-review, iCloud itself actually consists of three separate parts handling various aspects necessary for the whole thing to work the way it does. Sometimes it seems as if everything in the tech world is getting closed up into walled gardens, but I tend to think things are a little less simplistic. Just as it seems things are getting too closed and consolidated this creates impetus for the creation of alternative paradigms that would bring back the balance. While it may seem as if we are being pushed between huge walled gardens, there is little reason why alternatives outside of those walls cannot be created, which provide the same smooth user experience. The components and beginnings of it are already out there, like Simperium and Dropbox. It doesn’t seem like this dream is so far fetched.   Follow Us!

Through this new service eKomi, who in 2015 received a strategic investment from Goldman Sachs, will enable merchants of all sizes to request customer reviews and feedback via SMS text message. This Smart News Release features multimedia. View the full release here: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20160914006288/en/ "Our experience shows that businesses who collect the most feedback tend to be the most successful online, therefore our R&D team are always looking at means to accelerate review collection and to make customer insights easy to collect. Requesting reviews via SMS message was a natural progression to provide choice and ease of use for consumers to leave merchant feedback," Michael Ambros, eKomi co-founder and CEO commented. Research studies show that people react far more frequently to SMS messages when compared to traditional email collection methods. SMS has a final read rate of 98% on average and 90% of SMS messages are read within the first 3 seconds of receipt.* Ambros expanded further on how this translates to generating high review volumes by saying, "During our beta trial of SMS review requests, we saw outstanding review generation rates. For example, a London minicab company used our SMS review service and saw 56% of sent messages converting into reviews. The end result was over 2,500 reviews indexed and recognized by Google along with an average rating of 4.7 stars which can now be proudly displayed alongside their Google AdWords campaigns and alongside certain organic listings to boost conversion and lower their advertising costs." On 30th August, Google published changes to its policy on the number of reviews required to display seller ratings (up to five gold stars) next to Google listings. Previously the rule was 30 reviews over a rolling twelve-month period; this has now increased to 150 reviews making eKomi's SMS Collection Service vitally relevant for businesses to speedily act upon. This change has seen many SMB businesses with 30-149 reviews lose their coveted Google Stars. Simon Woods, GM & VP of Global SMB Sales commented, "Since this policy change from Google, we've seen many of our own customers and those using other review solutions contacting us for help and advice on how to get their Google Seller Rating (Stars) back. With our Account Management team providing expert advice on optimizing existing collection methods such as email, tablet and pop-up review requests, many merchants are seeing the high response rates from SMS reviews, which achieve up to 5x the response from email as a fast solution to reinstate their Google Stars.” To coincide with the formal launch of the revolutionary SMS service at DMEXCO and to support SMBs who are facing challenges since this policy change, eKomi is offering their new SMS service at a 50% discount for the next two months. New and existing eKomi customers can add on this service for as little as €10 per month. Added Michael Ambros, "At eKomi we've always been champions of business growth and consumer feedback. We want to help businesses get vital feedback and the marketing benefits associated with powerful Google Seller ratings, so we want to make this generous 50% off SMS review collection offer available to all prospective and existing eKomi customers who wish to add the service as well as to other businesses using alternative review services that can no longer get enough reviews to retain their Google Stars." DMEXCO attendees can visit the eKomi exhibits in Hall 9, Stand C-014 as well as Hall 7, Stand A55-B58.

'The family in Assam, where we see the little girl washing her face in the gutter before she heads to school, to me that is a shocking story.' 'But there are hundreds of millions of people in these circumstances and what can they do but to carry on.' Canadian-Indian filmmaker Richie Mehta has worked on diverse subjects -- from very compassionate exploration of India's underprivileged: Siddharth (2013) and Amal (2007) (both films are now available on Netflix) to a sci-fi thriller I Will Follow You Down (2013). Mehta has now directed a unique project, India in a Day -- a 90-minute documentary about India today as seen through the eyes of its citizens. The Google-produced documentary is entirely crowd sourced, in the sense that all the footage was provided by individuals in India. Mehta and his team -- including executive producers Ridley Scott and Anurag Kashyap, -- reached out to hundreds of thousands of Indians who are connected through social media, or use smartphones and other video recording devices. The request was for these people to record any event happening around them or in their lives. The only catch was the videos had to be shot on October 10, 2015. Once all the footage was submitted, Mehta and his team spent several months in a post-production editing facility in London and what they put together is now called India in a Day The film premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival. India in a Day is a lovingly made portrayal of a nation on the move, with its highs and lows. While the film looks at the bright, upbeat moments in the lives of some Indians, it does not forget the large numbers who have not been impacted by India's growth story. Mehta's film has a lot of heart. Aseem Chhabra spoke to Mehta for Rediff.com before the film's premiere about working on a project very different from his other films. Richie, how many entries did you get and how many hours of footage did you have? We had over 16,000 submissions and just under 400 hours of footage. You watched all 16,000 submissions? No, I did not. We had a team of people and they were assigned various chunks of footage. And they would rate each footage. I would see the good stuff and the okay stuff. But I also kept randomly checking the bad stuff just to make sure nothing was missed. We did this for months. I actually saw about 4,000 clips. There were times when people just had their cameras out capturing traffic for hours. There was nothing there. But there were many, many stories that were more meaningful. And just to backtrack, how did you reach out to people besides using social media? Social media, of course and Google put out the call on their Indian home page. I did a lot of press around the country. Anurag Kashyap, Shekhar Kapur and Zoya Akhtar -- they all did call out videos. And we had an outreach team in Delhi that had people in various parts of the country to get the word out. So as compared to your other films where you have written scripts, pitched and then raised money, you had no idea what kind of film you were going to make when you set out with the project? Right. Absolutely no idea. The film was created on the editing table. And while you were watching the clips and editing, the story just evolved. I love how you start with the morning and then go through the day, lunch and afternoon, until the night. That idea also emerged out of seeing the footage? No. That basic structure is there in the other Life in a Day films, including Japan in a Day, Britain in a Day and Italy in a Day (all produced by Ridley Scott). That was not mandatory, but they said that is what seemed to work. So we looked at the footage, we noticed that a lot of the stories with emotional resonance seemed to be coming in the afternoon. And that worked dramatically for the film. You want those sorts of narratives two-thirds into the film. If you have lured the audience through the lightness, the snappy movements, then you can transition them into the moving segments. The segment where actor Rajesh Tailang's bother has cancer that was shot in the afternoon? You show it later as well. Yes, in the afternoon and the sun is setting, which takes us into the evening, when he is driving. Segments like this became the pillars. We laid them down and we built the film around them. What was the biggest challenge you faced making the film? I think the biggest challenge was doing justice to the honest and genuine nature of the footage that we were given and trying to present it in a manner that really embodied what was happening -- not just in India, but was a reflection of humanity. There were some really big things that we were going to tackle. And that is why it was important for me to make the farmer's story the spine of the film. We were given so much beautiful footage of this farmer's life near Dehradun. I thought it was a perfect counterpoint to the progress that we talk about. The nature of progress is questioned in this film. So I wanted to visit this issue in a manner that doesn't beat you over the head, but it leaves a provocative note outside of other emotional elements in the film. For some reason I thought this would turn out to be a very upbeat India shinning kind of a film. And I was surprised it was not so always. You do show a lot of hardship people go through in their daily lives in rural areas and even in cities. And that story of Priya towards the end -- a single mom, her life story was heartbreaking. People were really honest in front of the camera. Yes, they had something to say. I think within many stories you see different shades of emotions. Priya's story, for instance, is very tragic. And all of this must have come as a complete surprise to you right? Rajesh is the only character you know since he played the lead in your last film Siddharth. Exactly. There are a few other people I know who submitted and ended up getting in the film with small bits. I had approached everybody I knew as well asking them to send footage. It so happened that October 10 is Rajesh's birthday. And he told me that he was going to meet his brother who had cancer. And I said please, without being disrespectful, if you can capture your birthday celebration moment with your brother, it would be lovely. Is his brother still alive? No, he passed away. How long was the editing process? It lasted from October 11 to when we finished the job in June. It was total collaboration between my editor and Google team. And it was a new country for me, working in London. It's a whole new industry. I loved the music. We were very fortunate to work with Stephen Warbeck (Oscar winner for Shakespeare in Love). He is an amazing composer. Was there a deadline to finish the film very soon? We had to finish it to get it online on YouTube. But they were very gracious to give us some more time and that made the film really special. So what did you learn about India making this film? You go to India often, you have shot your films there, but what different stuff did you learn this time? India will never, ever cease to confound me. No matter how many times I feel that I have gotten my head wrapped around it. The Andaman Island women (in the segment towards the middle of the film), who did not even know what the mainland is -- that is shocking. But there is also something very calming about many of the stories you show. People seem secure in their lives, even though some of their lives are tough. The family in Assam, where we see the little girl washing her face in the gutter before she heads to school, to me that is a shocking story. And we tried to present it in a non-judgmental manner, just as the film was presented to us. The family just carries on its way, there is a little shack along the road, the children go to a temple to ask for money and then they go to school. We look and say their life is so tragic. But there are hundreds of millions of people in these circumstances and what can they do but to carry on. That will never cease to amaze me. Was it the most fun you had making a film, where you were handed material and told to make a narrative out of it? It was really special. Honestly, going into it I thought I don't have to put my heart and soul into it, since the footage will speak for itself and the film will evolve. And if anything, it will be sociologically fascinating. But I soon realised that to do this right it would take absolute devotion and dedication. Which story are you most attached to? I am really close to all of them. There is a reason we chose them and there are lots of them we could not put in. But the last image of the film, the farmer -- and you know my other films -- there is a resemblance between that farmer to the character in Siddharth and in Amal. And an emotional character resemblance as well. There is something about the world he comes from, his attitude, which I find extremely moving and very important to look at. So after the TIFF screening where does the film go? After TIFF it will be released in cinemas in India on September 23. And shortly after that it will go on YouTube in India. The international released has to be worked out. Once it is released the film will live on YouTube.

Through this new service eKomi, who in 2015 received a strategic investment from Goldman Sachs, will enable merchants of all sizes to request customer reviews and feedback via SMS text message. This Smart News Release features multimedia.

Requesting reviews via SMS message was a natural progression to provide choice and ease of use for consumers to leave merchant feedback," Michael Ambros, eKomi co-founder and CEO commented. Research studies show that people react far more frequently to SMS messages when compared to traditional email collection methods. SMS has a final read rate of 98% on average and 90% of SMS messages are read within the first 3 seconds of receipt.* Ambros expanded further on how this translates to generating high review volumes by saying, "During our beta trial of SMS review requests, we saw outstanding review generation rates. For example, a London minicab company used our SMS review service and saw 56% of sent messages converting into reviews. The end result was over 2,500 reviews indexed and recognized by Google along with an average rating of 4.7 stars which can now be proudly displayed alongside their Google AdWords campaigns and alongside certain organic listings to boost conversion and lower their advertising costs." On 30th August, Google published changes to its policy on the number of reviews required to display seller ratings (up to five gold stars) next to Google listings. Previously the rule was 30 reviews over a rolling twelve-month period; this has now increased to 150 reviews making eKomi's SMS Collection Service vitally relevant for businesses to speedily act upon. This change has seen many SMB businesses with 30-149 reviews lose their coveted Google Stars. Simon Woods, GM VP of Global SMB Sales commented, "Since this policy change from Google, we've seen many of our own customers and those using other review solutions contacting us for help and advice on how to get their Google Seller Rating (Stars) back. With our Account Management team providing expert advice on optimizing existing collection methods such as email, tablet and pop-up review requests, many merchants are seeing the high response rates from SMS reviews, which achieve up to 5x the response from email as a fast solution to reinstate their Google Stars." To coincide with the formal launch of the revolutionary SMS service at DMEXCO and to support SMBs who are facing challenges since this policy change, eKomi is offering their new SMS service at a 50% discount for the next two months. New and existing eKomi customers can add on this service for as little as €10 per month. Added Michael Ambros, "At eKomi we've always been champions of business growth and consumer feedback. We want to help businesses get vital feedback and the marketing benefits associated with powerful Google Seller ratings, so we want to make this generous 50% off SMS review collection offer available to all prospective and existing eKomi customers who wish to add the service as well as to other businesses using alternative review services that can no longer get enough reviews to retain their Google Stars." DMEXCO attendees can visit the eKomi exhibits in Hall 9, Stand C-014 as well as Hall 7, Stand A55-B58.
