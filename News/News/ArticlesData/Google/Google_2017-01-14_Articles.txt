Meanwhile, those in other parts of the Cusack and Hogan stands carry a value between 110 euros to 186 euros.

RELATED COMPANIES EXPAND ADD TO Portfolio Watchlist OUTLOOK? +ve -ve Wallace x Loading data... ChartsValuation & Peer ComparisonCommunity Buzz Close ✕ By Mark Gurman and Mark Bergen Just over two years after leaving Google, Andy Rubin is preparing to take on the smartphone industry he helped create. Rubin, creator of the Android operating system, is planning to marry his background in software with artificial intelligence in a risky business: consumer hardware. Armed with about a 40-person team, filled with recruits from Apple Inc. and Alphabet Inc.'s Google, Rubin is preparing to announce a new company called Essential and serve as its Chief Executive Officer, according to people familiar with the matter. A platform company designed to tie multiple devices together, Essential is working on a suite of consumer hardware products, including ones for the mobile and smart home markets, one of the people said. The centerpiece of the system is a high-end smartphone with a large edge-to-edge screen that lacks a surrounding bezel. At the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas in early January, Rubin discussed the smartphone with mobile carrier executives, including some from Sprint Corp., people familiar with the talks said. Rubin registered Essential Products Inc. with California regulators in November 2015. In late 2016, the company registered "Essential" with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, listing smartphones, tablets, accessories and "computer operating software for mobile phones" among its goods and services. It's unclear if the devices will run on software based on Android. While still in the prototyping stage, Rubin's phone is aimed at the top of the market where Apple Inc.'s iPhone and Alphabet Inc.'s new Pixel reside. It's expected to include high-end materials and the ability to gain new hardware features over time, the people said. Representatives for Rubin and Sprint declined to comment. Rubin sold Android to Google in 2005. He spent eight years at its helm at Google, turning the operating system from a tiny project into the globe's most dominant software for running mobile devices. In 2013, he stepped down from Android to form Google's robotics unit before leaving altogether in 2014. Rubin's next venture was a startup incubator called Playground Global, which backs artificial intelligence, robotics, and augmented reality projects. Rubin is convinced AI is the next big change to ripple through the technology industry. "New computing platforms happen every 10 to 12 years," he said at the Bloomberg Technology Conference in June. "What’s the next platform?... It’s about data and people training AI systems to learn." Playground Global, which occupies a sprawling warehouse in Silicon Valley, has raised at least $300 million from big investors including Hewlett-Packard Co., Google, and Apple supplier Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. The latter, known as Foxconn, is in talks to manufacture Rubin's new smartphone, according to people familiar with the matter. At least one prototype of Rubin's phone boasts a screen larger than the iPhone 7 Plus's (5.5-inches) but has a smaller overall footprint because of the lack of bezels, one of the people said. The startup is experimenting with enabling the phone's screen to sense different levels of pressure, similar to an iPhone, the person said. Rubin's team is testing an industrial design with metal edges and a back made of ceramic, which is more difficult to manufacture than typical smartphone materials, two of the people said. Essential's engineers are developing a proprietary connector that serves double duty for charging the battery and expanding the phone's functionality over time, one person familiar with the planning said. The magnetic connector would allow Essential or even third parties to create hardware accessories that add features to the smartphone. For instance, Rubin’s engineers are working on a sphere-shaped camera add-on that shoots high-resolution 360 degree photographs, the person said. Rubin is aiming to put the phone on sale around the middle of this year for a price close to that of an iPhone 7 ($649), a person familiar with the matter said, adding that all of the plans are still in flux. Technology news website The Information earlier reported Rubin was working on a phone. Helping run the project are former Google colleagues and Apple managers, including Rebecca Zavin, Joe Tate, Linda Jiang, and Jason Keats. Zavin, a former senior Google software manager, is running software for Rubin. Keats and Tate are helping run hardware engineering, and Jiang is a key designer for Essential, according to a person familiar with the startup. Kelly Liang, a former business executive with the Google X lab, is managing business development and Brian Wallace, a former Samsung and Magic Leap executive, is leading marketing.

Rubin remained with Google in its Android division until 2013, when he moved over to its robotics unit. In 2014, Rubin departed Google entirely and in 2015 he formed his own tech hardware incubator called Playground Global. The company occupies a sprawling warehouse in Silicon Valley Bloomberg has reported that the incubator has raised a total of $300 million so far from a number of investors, including Google, Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., and HP. The company is in talks with Foxconn to manufacture the new smartphone from Essential. Click Here for New Smartphones Best Online Deals Stay tuned to GizBot for more updates!

Essential currently touts around a 40-person team drawn from recruits from Apple and Google. According to Bloomberg, the company aims to develop a suite of consumer electronics that would target mobile and smart home markets. The expected centerpiece of the product family is a premium smartphone that is intended to go head to head with competitors like Google’s Pixel lineup and the Apple iPhone. Shipping plans for the phone are still being established, but Essential tentatively hopes to launch the phone later this year at a potential price point of around $650.

The startup is experimenting with enabling the phone's screen to sense different levels of pressure, similar to an iPhone, the person said. Rubin's team is testing an industrial design with metal edges and a back made of ceramic, which is more difficult to manufacture than typical smartphone materials, two of the people said. The smartphone and hardware family are also possible starting points for several new software and hardware technologies. Modular add-ons like those found on the since-cancelled Project Ara smartphone are one possibility for Essential. Per Bloomberg, developers are working on a connector that could connect to accessories like improved cameras. While the extent of Essential’s scope is still up in the air, technology like Apple’s Siri and Amazon’s Alexa could also be a likely area for the company’s hardware and smart home development. Since leaving Google in 2014, Rubin has been an active presence in the artificial intelligence space and launched startup incubator Playground Global, which focuses on AI and robotics-based ventures.

Rubin aims to launch it this year, reports claim.  ( Justin Sullivan | Getty Images ) Advertisement Two years after departing Google, Andy Rubin is about to make headway on the smartphone industry — a field he helped push. Rubin is the creator of Android, a mobile operating system running on more than 86 percent of all mobile phones in existence as per IDC. He's planning to merge artificial intelligence with his prowess in software engineering, and he's doing it to produce consumer hardware. He's not alone in that venture, however. His team is composed of 40 individuals — some poached from Apple and some from Google — and they're called Essential, a forthcoming company Rubin will helm, reports Bloomberg, citing individuals familiar with the matter. The Creator Of Android Will Create A Smartphone Essential is poised to become a platform company looking to fuse multiple devices together. It's currently developing a suite of consumer hardware products for something as integral as mobile and something as nascent as smart homes. The centerpiece will be a smartphone with an edge-to-edge screen sans a surrounding bezel. The smartphone in question, however, is currently in its prototyping phase, although Rubin is intent on putting it in parallel ranks where the iPhone and the Pixel flagships sit atop. The phone is expected to be manufactured with high-end materials, metal edges, and a ceramic back panel. It's also expected to boast the ability to gain hardware features over time, which might allude to an idea similar to modular smartphones. One prototype of Rubin's smartphone boasts a larger screen than the iPhone 7 Plus but one that gains a smaller footprint because of the bezel's absence. What's more, Rubin is currently trying to create a screen that can sense pressure, similar to Apple's 3D touch technology. A proprietary connector is in the works too, being designed in a way that will enable charging the handset and bringing expanded functionality over time. Developers can come out with compatible accessories with the said connector, and not just accessories, but also hardware peripherals to be clear. For example, Rubin's team is working on a 360-degree camera that will attach to the connector, allowing users to create high-res 360-degree photographs right from the phone. AI Is The Future Google bought Android in 2005. Rubin spent eight years at the company, developing an operating system that would later become the most prevalent platform on mobile devices globally, which is no easy feat. After exiting Google's doors in 2014, his next venture became Playground Global, a startup centered on robotics, AI, and augmented reality. AI, according to Rubin, is the major inflection point the technology industry will experience and in some ways is already experiencing. Every decade or so, he said in June, new platforms naturally emerge, and this time, it's AI. "What's the next platform? It's about data and people training AI systems to learn," Rubin said. Pricing And Availability Rubin is aiming for a price point close to that of the iPhone 7's, although plans still fluctuate at this stage of the phone's development. It's being tipped for mid-year launch, and Foxconn is already in discussions to manufacture it, Bloomberg's report claims. Trademarks for Rubin's company, Essential, have already been filed with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. Bloomberg's report didn't expand on other products Essential is currently developing, save for "a suite" of consumer hardware products — and this has all come about without Rubin's official confirmation. The tech industry is just revving up this year, but it's already becoming an all-bets-are-off situation now that Android's creator is aiming to parallel the pantheon of smartphones dominating the field today. We'll see how this "Essential" phone pans out. TAG Andy Rubin, Android, Essential, Artificial Intelligence © 2016 Tech Times, All rights reserved. Do not reproduce without permission.

By Karissa Bell2017-01-12 20:09:07 UTC Want to use that new selfie emoji? How about the facepalm or avocado? If you're on Android, or texting someone who is, there's a good chance those new characters aren't working.  That's because Google, like Apple, ties emoji updates to its new software releases: update to the latest version of Android, get the newest emoji. It sounds straightforward enough, but there's one glaring problem that's been a major handicap for Google for years. SEE ALSO: The ultimate guide to the 104 new emoji in iOS 10.2 Unlike Apple, which controls both its hardware and its software, Google relies on dozens of manufacturing partners to create the bulk of its handsets (Google's Nexus and Pixel devices excepted). Those partners also control when their customers get new software and, unfortunately for Google, have a pretty piss-poor record of getting these updates out in a timely manner. That's why Google's Android Nougat update, which rolled out in August, is currently installed on less than 1 percent of all Android devices. Those dismal numbers are alarming for a number of reasons, but are especially bad news for emoji fans. They mean most Android users will have to wait months, or even a year, to get the same emoji as their iPhone-wielding peers. Worse yet, when someone with the new characters sends them to you, all you'll see is a series of blank boxes. Given how much we've come to rely on emoji in everyday conversation, it can be a big hurdle when one side doesn't have the same characters as the other. "A phone that can't see the 12+ months of new emojis is crippled as a communication device," Jeremy Burge wrote on the Emojipedia blog Wednesday. This issue of not-so-timely updates, also known as fragmentation, is nothing new. It's plagued Android for years. In fact, it's gotten so bad, Google was reportedly considering a plan that would publicly "shame" manufacturers who didn't release updates fast enough.  Unfortunately, manufacturers have so far given little indication that they are willing to adopt faster upgrade cycles.  But it's not all bad news for emoji lovers. As Burge points out, app developers have stepped in to fill in the gaps by adding support for new emoji releases independently of the OS updates. That's why you can find new emoji on Twitter, Whatsapp, Messenger, Slack, Snapchat and Telegram before you'll see them anywhere else. Just don't hold your breath to see them on your phone's native messaging app. BONUS: Signs you're reading too much into instant messages with emoji Topics: Android, Apps and Software, emoji, Google, Tech About Us Jobs Advertise Subscribe Privacy Terms Mashable is a global, multi-platform media and entertainment company.

My Oculus avatar getting ready to head out into the metaverse. Image: Oculus VR  By Adario Strange2017-01-12 21:23:40 UTC When Mark Zuckerberg donned an Oculus Rift on stage at the Oculus Connect conference last fall to show off a group of avatars playing cards in virtual reality, it was meant to be a peek at the future of social networking. But it turns out that future is already here: Even without Facebook's direct participation, social VR is quickly becoming a thing. Facebook's own Oculus Rooms social VR app (previewed last year) has yet to come to the Rift headset, but a wide array of social VR apps have already taken off, fostering vibrant communities of people coming together from around the world to interact as simple yet surprisingly effective avatars, facilitated by high-end VR headsets like the Rift and HTC Vive. SEE ALSO: 5 VR safety tips to stop you from destroying your home Currently, most of the public's limited interest in VR is centered on where we know the money already is: gaming. But social VR is already beginning to deliver on VR's promise of an "empathy engine," using the medium to connect real people from around the world. But what does this new universe of social VR look like? I decided to find out. It's an avatar world If you tried to explain the internet to someone from the 18th century, and all you had as a visual aid was a painting of a Google results page full of links, you'd have a tough time convincing that person that the painting represented a global network of living information on every topic known to humankind. That's about how tough it is to describe the groundbreaking events currently unfolding in social VR — YouTube videos of avatars hanging out with each other simply don't translate the full impact of the experience. Name-checking Second Life — the massive multiplayer online experience that launched in 2003 and is actually still around — scratches the surface of it, but the virtual bar has been raised with fully immersive headsets, and the VR universe is something entirely new. Social VR is already beginning to deliver on VR's promise of an "empathy engine" In the past two weeks, I've had one-on-one experiences with people from Sweden, China, the UK, Chile, Florida, Atlanta and California — all from the comfort of my New York City apartment using the Rift. Unlike the social networks that most of us are accustomed to, we didn't meet as icons or user names on flat, 2D screens. Instead, our interactions occurred in fully realized three-dimensional spaces, each person represented by 3D avatars allowing individual interactivity with almost the same degree of freedom and expressiveness we're accustomed to in the real world. Looking down at your virtual hands and then walking over to view your personal avatar in a mirror for the first time is a transformative experience. Gone are the joysticks and keyboard commands; your face and hands are your interface in VR, and even something as simple as looking over your own virtual shoulder (yes, that's possible) pulls you deeper into the immersive experience.  In one VR environment, a handshake with another person's avatar results in a pleasant explosion of pixels, which means you're now friends with that person. Another environment does the same thing with fist bumps, except the action serves as a VIP ticket to a private party in another room. Currently, the social VR community is a fairly small, tight-knit group of pioneers, much like the early days of the IRC (internet relay chat) that offered a vibrant but mostly under-the-radar social meeting place just before the explosion of the web. My customized VR avatars in Bigscreen, vTime and AltspaceVR. Image: BIGSCREEN, VTIME, ALTSPACEVR After a good deal of VR bar-hopping, I found the most active social communities in four social VR apps: Bigscreen, vTime, AltspaceVR and Rec Room. Bigscreen and Rec Room are both limited to the Vive and the Rift (for now) while AltspaceVR and vTime both work with the aforementioned headsets as well as cheaper options like the Gear VR (vTime also works on Google Daydream View). None of the experiences except vTime touted Cardboard as an option.  Like the concrete-and-steel social clubs of the world, each space had its own distinct look and personality, attracting different types of users and offering varying levels of social intimacy. What it's like to 'go out' in VR I met my first group of people in Bigscreen, an environment suited to small gatherings of up to four people in rooms in where users can interact while seated in swank virtual apartments, and watch videos in private movie theaters. The environment also doubles as a great personal workspace, as it easily allows you to work on your computer's desktop from VR (the Vive version lets you type using the SteamVR virtual keyboard, but the best input method for web surfing I found was via voice on Google Chrome). Beyond social and entertainment, Bigscreen also seems perfectly suited to the next phase of telecommuting and virtual presence meetings currently facilitated by tools like Skype.  When you enter Bigscreen you have the option creating rooms and inviting others, or joining rooms in progress (the limit is four people per room, so things get intimate pretty fast). My first Bigscreen meeting paired me with a man and woman from Asia and a man from western Europe. We were all newbies trying to figure out how to use the app so I kicked things off and opened a trailer for us to watch — you guessed it, The Matrix. Predictably, it was a hit, and that broke the ice. Soon, everyone began trading social VR tips and tricks.  It's scary meeting someone in VR for the first time. There's no user name to hide behind. And even though your avatar isn't really your own body, there's a distinct sense that you're exposed.  Nevertheless, it's scary meeting someone in VR for the first time. There's no user name to hide behind. And even though your avatar isn't really your own body, there's a distinct sense that you're exposed to others and must put your best virtual foot forward (much like real life). Conversations are verbal, not typed, so you don't have the luxury of a backspace key or taking your time when you respond. It's a virtual world, but it's real-time. My next encounter occurred in vTime, where I was transported onto a moving train in which three people from different locations were already holding a conversation. After introducing myself, we all moved to another environment that had us sitting on a satellite orbiting Earth. You can see a screencap of that meetup below, but the static, 2D picture doesn't do justice to the experience — it really felt as though Earth's massive form was moving below us.  Everyone, even the one veteran user (six months deep) among us, seemed a bit giddy sitting atop the world like gods as space detritus floated by, only momentarily interrupting our discussion about the implications of this new, virtual universe. We soon teleporting to a campfire and then to a mountain cliff. Each environment looked and even, to a certain extent, felt like the real thing — only missing details like the wind from the realistic sky or the heat from the crackling fire. It was at this point that it occurred to me that we may never really need the fabled Star Trek transporter H.G. Wells' time machine, because in virtual reality, you can already transport to any place or time with a mere gesture.  In AltspaceVR, things were a lot more active. The rooms were filled with dozens people of all ages and nationalities and temperaments. While the vast majority of my experiences in social VR were friendly and polite, AltspaceVR felt a little more like the real world in that there were a least a few trolls less excited by the new platform and more interested in getting attention. This was most apparent during an open-mic night at a club users could teleport into. As raucous as a late-night New York City comedy club, it took almost 30 minutes to get roughly 40 people (avatars) to settle down and start the show.  The early crowd begins to gather at an open mic night in AltspaceVR. Image: altspacevr After a couple of performers, one guy got on stage and tried out a couple of racist jokes, after which he was promptly booed off stage and the show went on without a hitch. Like the offline world, AltspaceVR has its bad actors, but that authenticity reinforces the feeling of immersion. You feel as though you're in a real club.  "The same thing that makes social presence such a powerful force for positive interactions can also make it a powerful force for harassment." On the opposite end of the spectrum is Rec Room, a social VR space centered around bringing people together to play games that require physical interactions instead of mere joystick skills. It's in Rec Room that I played several games of paintball, bonding with my own team of strangers as we worked together to defeat opposing teams. Later, I dipped into a room for a game of VR charades with several others, which provided just as many laughs as the game does in your living room. However, the experience was somewhat marred by enthusiastic children using their newfound avatar powers to harass those with less experience in the space.  A very young girl, obviously having sensor-tracking issues with her real-world hardware, was stuck with her avatar's body half-lodged in the floor of the room. After she called out for help (her voice actually sounded like she was in pain after a while), a couple of players, also children, tried to help by pulling at her avatar, but that only made things worse by obscuring her view. Virtual bodies can't be hurt, but the episode was disturbing nonetheless. I wondered about the logical extension of that situation, where a bad actor in VR tries to impede or ruin another user's experience. Last year a woman wrote about her experience of being "groped" in VR, and it's a harrowing tale. I asked the Rec Room people about the very real possibility of harassment in VR: "Online harassment is a topic we take very seriously here. We really want to make sure Rec Room is a great community for people from all walks of life," says Nick Fajt, the CEO and co-founder of Seattle-based Against Gravity, the developer of Rec Room, during a subsequent meeting we had in VR. "We've found that social VR is something of a double-edged sword. The same thing that makes social presence such a powerful force for positive interactions can also make it a powerful force for harassment …  we feel a particular obligation to drive the state of the art forward in preventing and addressing online harassment." To that end, Rec Room, as well as the other social VR apps I visited, all have various tools devoted to reporting bad behavior, removing disruptive people and discouraging harassment. Although the tools all vary, a common function is the ability to point at a user or look a user up (user names were displayed at all times in each app) and enable a blocking or reporting action.  Meeting above planet Earth in one of vTime's VR rooms. Image: vTime "Personal space is sacrosanct, whether physical or virtual, and those boundaries take on new significance with a HMD strapped to your face," says Clemens Wangerin, managing director of UK-based vTime. "I'm pleased to say that the clear majority use the service exactly as intended. Those that don't are dealt with swiftly when reported, and can receive temporary or permanent bans." And while all the services have age limits (usually 13), there are currently no hard measures in place to prevent children from interacting with adult strangers. That situation is mirrored on the web, of course, but made more troubling when a sense of presence is involved via 3D avatars, audio interaction and hand interfaces.  "We pioneered the concept of a 'personal space bubble,' which prevents people from sticking virtual objects into your virtual body, or 'groping' you," says Darshan Shankar, the CEO and founder of Berkeley, CA-based Bigscreen. "Those [unwanted actions] can feel very uncomfortable in VR and a personal space bubble was a simple, clever solution to the problem. Many other social VR apps have now implemented similar controls to excellent results." A VR smartwatch and control mechanism that you wear on your wrist in Rec Room. Image: Against Gravity Part of the reason harassment in these early stages of social VR is being given so much attention is due to the lessons learned on the social media web. And although there are no guaranteed methods currently in place to guard against harassment in social VR spaces, after much use, I'm convinced that the aforementioned companies are working earnestly to keep VR from devolving from an empathy engine into an "enmity engine." Early days for VR meetups During my first-ever business meeting in VR, Fajt took me on an in-depth tour through some of Rec Room's lesser-known corners as we discussed the future of social VR. Fajt, who spent several years working on the Microsoft HoloLens team, believes augmented reality will eventually become incredibly useful to mainstream consumers, but he's placing his early bet on VR as the path to the next step beyond today's web.  When I asked him why, he echoed the sentiments I've heard frequently in recent months from those studying both platforms: In general, AR is harder than VR, at least in the short-term. Although hits like Pokémon Go and Snapchat Lenses offer amazing imagery to overlay real-world environments, nothing compares to the full immersion available in VR. But Fajt believes this is all transitional, and that within the next decade we'll see tetherless glasses that seamlessly handle the task of delivering both AR and VR content. But in the near term, VR simply packs more punch as a platform.  None of the companies would reveal membership numbers, although Bigscreen, which is still in beta, claims its most passionate users stay in the app for 20 to 30 hours a week. Most estimates place the collective number of mobile and high-end VR headsets sold in 2016 in the single-digit millions.  In terms of revenue, none of the social VR spaces I used, all of which are free to use, had obvious revenue models. Predictably, the focus for these services for now is around building community first and figuring out profit down the road.  Against Gravity CEO Nick Fajt tells me about the future of Rec Room over a game of VR poker. Image: Against Gravity But unlike the web's early social-networking growth around sites like Friendster, MySpace and later Facebook, the grace period for social VR to develop without intense competition will be extremely short. Facebook's Oculus Rooms, which is currently available in a limited form for Samsung Gear VR users, will roll out in a major way for Oculus Rift later this year. When that happens, anyone withe Rift will be encouraged to link their Facebook accounts — a shift that will prompt VR's nascent user base to choose between these small, pioneering social VR apps and the world's biggest social network.  No, none of these spaces are hyperrealistic simulacras in the tradition of The Matrix. But as Epic Games founder and Unreal Engine pioneer Tim Sweeney demonstrated on stage months ago at Steam Dev Days (the game service's developer conference), we're less than a decade away from realistic human avatars in VR. That change seems destined to deliver on one of the biggest promises of the medium: teleporting, with others, to fully immersive worlds. When that happens, much of the groundwork will have been laid by the VR social networks of today.

March 31, 2016 | Filed under: Columns,Opinion,Talking Point | Posted by: The Villager The pop-up Firewall Internet Cafe ran from Feb. 9 to March 6 at Chinatown Soup gallery, at 16 Orchard St., with roundtable discussions at Orbital, 155 Rivington St. Photos by Isaac James BY BILL WEINBERG | Manhattan-based artist Joyce Yu-Jean Lee never guessed she was in for a bit of international intrigue and even global headlines when she launched a show and accompanying discussion panels in February at a couple of alternative venues on the Lower East Side. The installation, which lasted a month, was a pop-up Internet cafe dubbed “Firewall.” This is a reference to the “Great Firewall of China” (officially the “Golden Shield”) that filters the Internet in the People’s Republic. At Firewall Cafe, visitors got to input search terms of their choice into computers attached to split-screen monitors set up to display simultaneously the results from Google and Baidu — the state-approved Chinese alternative, operating from within the Great Firewall. The installation was hosted by a gallery with the appropriate name of Chinatown Soup. (Although it is actually on lower Orchard St., just where Chinatown is now starting to expand into the old Lower East Side). Baidu is the default search engine at all the Internet cafes in Chinatown, but in China it is practically mandatory. Google is blocked there — along with Facebook, Twitter and the Web sites of Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch. For the month that the Firewall installation was up, some 4,000 searches were logged, and eventually the results will all be browsable at the show’s Web site, Firewallcafe.com. The most obvious contrasts, you might imagine, come from the search “Tiananmen Square.” Google brings back iconic images from the 1989 protests and repression. There is of course not a trace of this on Baidu — strictly tourism shots. In a cross-fertilization between Chinatown and the L.E.S. art scene, Apex for Youth, a program for underserved Asian communities in the city, organized classes of schoolkids to come visit the exhibition. But what got Firewall Cafe into trouble was the pair of panel discussions that accompanied the installation, hosted by the Rivington St. tech collective Orbital. The first, held Feb. 19, was entitled “Networked Feminism in China,” and was to feature, in addition to Lee, three activists from the People’s Republic. One was Lu Pin, editor of the Beijing-based journal and social media platform Feminist Voices. Lu was a mentor figure for the “Feminist Five,” young women who were detained for weeks last year after performing a piece of public protest theater to oppose sexual harassment on the Beijing subway. Another was Xintong Liu, a designer and “social innovator” who organized the first L.G.B.T. group at Xiamen University. But the next one can’t be named. Lee will only say that this panelist works for women’s rights in China. After her name appeared on the announcement for the panel, her employer was pressured by government officials, in turn, to pressure her to cancel her participation in the panel. Lee and her co-organizers removed her name from the announcement, and tried to scrub the Internet of any mention of her name in the context of the panel. This online purge didn’t help — the threats escalated. The decision was taken to drop her from the panel. “I felt very guilty,” Lee said. “Here I am trying to do something supportive, and I got one of the panelists into trouble, inadvertently. I was caught off-guard. The panel was not even specifically related to censorship. It was about the role of the Internet in organizing support for the Feminist Five. To get this kind of backlash at an event about feminism was kind of shocking.” The incident sparked a reckoning about the lineup for the next panel. “We made a decision: No more Chinese nationals were to participate in our panels,” said Lee. The second panel, on “Creative Hacktivism,” actually did touch on issues of censorship. One panelist was Jason Ng, author of “Blocked on Weibo” — a book examining what content gets suppressed on China’s answer to Twitter. Another was a stateside supporter of GreatFire.org, a group that documents the content-filtering of the Great Firewall — and attempts to circumvent it through technical creativity. But the panel was itself censored, in a way — the Chinese nationals initially invited to participate were dropped. It is unknowable how far up in the bureaucracy the decision to pressure the panelist emerged. And the pressure arguably backfired — the cancellation got Lee and her project written up in the Washington Post, certainly unwanted attention for Beijing. But the affair points to the fragility of freedom in a globalized age. “As Americans we take our free press rights completely for granted,” Lee said. “A fifth of the world’s population doesn’t have the freedom to see the world the way we see it, unfiltered.” However, Lee acknowledged that Google filters search results, as well — if in more subtle ways than Baidu. She says that the idea of her project was to take a “critical look at both Google and Baidu.” Dual-screen computer stations allowed users to do an Internet search, then see how the results varied on Google versus Baidu, China’s government-approved portal. Lu Pin has continued to speak publicly in Lower Manhattan — most recently at a March 23 panel on “Chinese Queer/Feminist Activists” at Bluestockings bookstore on Allen St. Lee said she has to respect the decisions of Chinese nationals regarding how public they want to be in their activism. “I don’t take the same kind of risk,” she said. “I just run the risk of not getting a visa the next time I want to visit China. It’s not the same thing. If you want to be very vocal, I respect that. If you want to maintain your anonymity, I respect that, too.” Lee’s interest in China has a personal aspect. She grew up in Texas, but her parents fled the Communist takeover of China in 1949 — initially to Taiwan. Her 2012 film, “Unfolding Nai Nai,” is something of an oral history project, in which the family’s story is revealed through the memories of Lee’s grandmother — now 102 years old and still living in Taiwan. Lee’s eyes were also opened by her 2011 artist residency program in China, where she had to use a VPN device to access the Web freely. (That’s a “virtual private network” that works by connecting to the Web through a computer outside China.) One friend she made in China, a young gay artist, later committed suicide — which Lee attributes, at least in part, to the closed atmosphere for people such as himself. And things have hardly improved in China since then. “Under Xi Jinping, the political climate is much more tense and fraught than it’s been in a long time,” Lee said. She cited the findings of rights groups that China is now facing its harshest atmosphere since the repression of the Tiananmen Square protests in 1989 and the closing of political space in the aftermath. And now that pressure was felt a world away on Rivington St. “Censorship doesn’t just happen online,” Lee said, summing up her take-away from the affair. “It happens in daily life through intimidation and coercion.” The Villager encourages readers to share articles: Tweet Advertisers from our print edition Comments are often moderated.

This story should serve as a giant wakeup call about the potential surveillance devices that many people are starting to allow into their own homes. original image (1160x768) The Amazon echo is not the only such device; others include personal assistants like Google Home, Google Now, Apple’s Siri, Windows Cortana, as well as other devices including televisions, game consoles , cars and toys. We can safely assume that the number of live microphones scattered throughout American homes will only increase to cover a wide range of “Internet of Things” (IoT) devices. (I will focus on microphones in this post, but these devices can include not just audio recorders but video as well, and the same considerations apply.) The insecurity of a nearby mic I was at a dinner party recently with close friends where the conversation turned to some entirely theoretical, screenplay-writing-type speculations about presidential assassinations—speculations that would be pretty dicey should certain outside parties who did not know us and where we were coming from be listening in. Realizing this as we spoke, the group thought of our host’s Amazon Echo, sitting on a side table with its little light on. The group’s conversation became self-conscious as we began joking about the Echo listening in. Joking or not, in short order our host walked over and unplugged it. It is exactly this kind of self-consciousness and chilling effects that surveillance—or even the most remote threat of surveillance—casts over otherwise freewheeling private conversations, and is the reason people need ironclad assurance that their devices will not—cannot—betray them. Overall, digital assistants and other IoT devices create a triple threat to privacy: from government, corporations, and hackers. It is a significant thing to allow a live microphone in your private space (just as it is to allow them in our public spaces). Once the hardware is in place, and receiving electricity, and connected to the Internet, then you’re reduced to placing your trust in the hands of two things that unfortunately are less than reliable these days: 1) software, and 2) policy. Software, once a mic is in place, governs when that microphone is live, when the audio it captures is transmitted over the Internet, and to whom it goes. Many devices are programmed to keep their microphones on at all times but only record and transmit audio after hearing a trigger phrase—in the case of the Echo, for example, “Alexa.” Any device that is to be activated by voice alone must work this way. There are a range of other systems. Samsung, after a privacy dust-up, assured the public that its smart televisions (like others) only record and transmit audio after the user presses a button on its remote control. The Hello Barbie toy only picks up and transmits audio when its user presses a button on the doll. Software is invisible, however. Most companies do not make their code available for public inspection, and it can be hacked, or unscrupulous executives can lie about what it does (think Volkswagen), or government agencies might try to order companies to activate them as a surveillance device. The dumber and more straightforward a user’s control, the better. Depriving a microphone of electricity by unplugging it and/or removing any batteries provides ironclad assurance that it’s not recording. A hardware switch is nearly as good, provided there’s no software mediation that could be overcome by hackers. (Switches can be bought for just that purpose.) A verbal command is far less certain, and devices like Echo will sometimes misinterpret sounds as their “wake word” and record random snippets of conversation. It's easy to see how a sentence such as “He was driving a Lexus in a way she said was dangerous” could be heard by an Echo as “Alexa: Sin away she said—was dangerous.” The constant potential for accidental recording means that users do not necessarily have complete control over what audio gets transmitted to the cloud. Once their audio is recorded and transmitted to a company, users depend for their privacy on good policies—how it is analyzed; how long and by whom it is stored, and in what form; how it is secured; who else it may be shared with; and any other purposes it may be used for. This includes corporate policies (caveat emptor), but also our nation’s laws and Constitution. Access to recordings by law enforcement We fear that some government agencies will try to argue that they do not need a warrant to access this kind of data. We believe the Constitution is clear, and that, at a minimum, law enforcement needs a warrant based on probable cause to access conversations recorded in the home using such devices. But more protections are needed. Congress, recognizing the extremely invasive nature of traditional wiretaps, enacted safeguards that go beyond what the courts had ruled the Constitution requires. These include requirements that wiretaps be used only for serious crimes, or be permitted only when other investigative procedures have failed or are unlikely to succeed. We think that these additional privacy protections should also apply to invasive digital devices in the home. Unfortunately the existing statutes governing the interceptions of voice communications are ridiculously tangled and confused and it’s not clear whether or how data recorded by devices in the home are covered by them. (CDT’s Joe Jerome has written a good roundup of that law and how it might apply to always-on devices.) When it comes to law enforcement access, the key issues for us as a legal matter are: Breadth. Access needs to be no broader than necessary. Any warrant authorizing access to stored conversations should particularly and narrowly describe the data that law enforcement has probable cause to believe is related to a crime—for example a specific time period, subject matter, and/or type of activity. Minimization. There need to be protections in place to limit the collection of information that is ultimately irrelevant. In the wiretap context these include rules requiring the police to stop listening when a conversation is irrelevant, and analagous rules should be developed for IoT device data. Notice. Historically, citizens served with search warrants have always received notice that their property is being searched—especially when that property is one’s home—and that practice should not be ended just because it is moving into the electronic realm. (We discussed this issue in greater depth last year.) Notice of IoT searches should always be served on all affected parties. In the Arkansas case, the police did serve Amazon with a warrant—but Amazon has fought it, apparently because of overbreadth. Our only information is what the company has said in a statement: that “Amazon objects to overbroad or otherwise inappropriate demands as a matter of course.” A legal contradiction Digital assistants, like smart meters and many other IoT devices, split open a contradiction between two legal doctrines that both sit at the core of privacy law: The sanctity of the home. The inside of the home has for centuries been sacred when it comes to privacy. The Supreme Court has refused to let police use thermal scanners on private homes, for example, despite government protests that it was only measuring the heat leaving the home. And although the Court has ruled that dog sniffs for drugs are not a search in cars or in public spaces, it refused to allow them near the home. As Justice Anthony Scalia pointed out in the thermal scanner case, “the Fourth Amendment draws a firm line at the entrance to the house.” The third-party doctrine. As strong as privacy jurisprudence has been in protecting the home, it has been very weak in another area. Under the court's so-called “third party doctrine,” the Constitution does not require police to get a warrant to get people's records from their bank, telephone company, internet service provider, Google, Amazon, or any other third party. As a result, law enforcement agencies have argued in recent years that they should be able to obtain information such as individuals’ cell phone records, location history, even emails from companies without a warrant. The contradiction arises when devices inside the home stream data about activities in that home to the servers of a third-party corporation. Because of the third party doctrine, to give just one example, police have been obtaining home energy-use data from utilities without a warrant. In a home with a “smart meter,” that kind of data can be so minutely detailed that it can reveal all kinds of details about what people are doing inside their homes—which appliances they use, and when they use them—and even what television shows they watch (based on the patterns of light and dark in a show, which changes a television set’s electricity draw). In fact, in the very same Arkansas murder case in which the police are seeking data from the suspect’s Amazon Echo, they built their case against him using warrantlessly obtained data from his smart water meter, which prosecutors say shows he used 140 gallons of water between 1 and 3 a.m. They allege he was trying to hose blood stains off his patio. (He says the AM/PM setting on the meter’s clock was wrong and he used that water in the afternoon in order to fill his hot tub.) The solution to the contradiction between the sanctity of the home and the third-party doctrine is clear: the third party doctrine must go. It is increasingly untenable in an era where much of the data created about people's lives sits on the servers of international corporations—and the growth of IoT devices like digital assistants will make its inadequacy in the information age even clearer. Recommendations In addition to rigorously applying constitutional privacy protections as outlined above, the following steps should be applied to IoT microphones: Speech fragments transmitted to companies should be retained for the minimal necessary period, should not be shared absent a warrant, and should not be used for other purposes. Companies should do whatever necessary to ensure their users have a clear understanding about what data is kept and for how long. That means fine print buried in a click-through agreement is not enough. Users should have access to any of their audio recordings that a company retains, and the option to delete them. Commendably, some companies (Google and Amazon, for example) already do this. It needs to become at minimum an expected, standard best practice. It should become standard for microphones to feature a hardwired, non-software-modifiable LED indicator light that turns on whenever a mic is on (defined as transmitting electrical signals to anywhere else). It might make sense for there to be another, separate indicator when software is recording and/or transmitting signals to the Internet. The more transparency to the consumer, the better. It should also become standard to build in a hardware power switch that physically cuts off electricity to a microphone so that consumers can stop a microphone from recording. As much as possible, the power interruption that that switch effects should be tangible or even visible, so that customers can feel complete certainty that the microphone cannot record, akin to the certainty that comes from putting a bandage (or ACLU sticker) over the camera on one’s laptop. To the greatest extent possible, the code governing the operation of microphones should be public. When people depend on software to protect their privacy, transparent code is the only way to give people assurance a device is doing what it’s supposed to and no more. Special attention should be paid to any capability for remote activation of recording. Best for privacy is for no such activation to be possible. If there is a strong case to be made that such capability may be desired by consumers, then it should be to the greatest extent possible designed to be something that only consumers themselves can activate, and that consumers can permanently disable if they wish. Consumers must also be given explicit warning where any such capabilities exist. Companies and policymakers need to address the raft of issues around the stability of IoT devices, especially in-home devices with microphones or cameras. When not regularly updated, for example, such devices quickly become security threats. And what happens when the company providing those updates goes out of business or is acquired—or just changes its privacy policy? Devices that start out as private and secure can become a toxic presence inside the home as a result of things happening in the outside world, and right now, consumers are on their own in a Wild West. One of the best things that can be done for privacy is for speech recognition capabilities to be embedded locally in a device, so there’s no need to send audio clips to servers across the Internet. While that can work now for some simple commands, experts say that good recognition of a broader array of speech still requires processing in the cloud. Legislative privacy protections are also needed. In addition to broad privacy rules governing corporate use of private data, which would help in this area as in so many others, Congress should lay out strong and precise standards for when the government can access data from these new devices. As with wiretaps, the privacy and public interests at stake may require protections beyond a warrant and notice requirement. Again, all of these principles should also apply to video that in-home devices may capture and potentially stream to the cloud, which carries the same threats and problems. It is a healthy thing that this Arkansas story has sparked a public conversation about always-on devices. We and other privacy advocates have been watching this technology for some time—our allies at the privacy group EPIC wrote a letter to the FTC in 2015 requesting an investigation of always-on devices and their privacy implications. And the Future of Privacy Forum, a DC think tank, produced a helpful report on the issue last year. But if microphones are going to be part of our daily lives in our intimate spaces, we need broader awareness of the issues they raise, and to settle on strong protections and best practices as soon as possible. https://www.aclu.org/blog/free-future/priv...

As well as getting comments noticed, it offers YouTubers a new way of monetizing their online activities. The idea is to connect content creators and fans during live stream events broadcast on the platform, during which viewers can interact with YouTubers by asking questions or leaving comments via a chat function. To boost visibility—especially if there are hundreds or even thousands of people watching—YouTube’s new “Super Chat” function will allow viewers to pay a few dollars to pin a message in pride of place at the top of the chat window. “Super Chat” messages will stay pinned at the top of the chat for up to five hours for maximum visibility, grabbing the attention of other viewers, as well as creators, who can reply at their leisure. Users choose the amount they pay to pin their “Super Chat” message. The more they pay, the longer the comment will be pinned. YouTube is already launching a beta with YouTube creators iHasCupquake (beauty, 5.2 million followers), Alex Wassabi (comedy, 2.2M) and Great Library (video games, 1.4M). The new service rolls out more widely from Tuesday, January 31 for creators in 20 countries looking to monetize their activities. “Super Chat” replaces “Fan Funding,” allowing viewers to make donations to YouTubers, which closes February 28. — AFP-Relaxnews                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Samsung to disclose Note 7 probe results on Jan 23 Facebook announces 'fake news' offensive in Germany E-waste rising dangerously in Asia, UN study shows Samsung probe finds battery was main cause of Note 7 fires, source claims Nintendo’s Switch to go on sale March 3 for US$300 (VIDEO) As labour force shrinks, China turns to robots WhatsApp vulnerable to snooping, report says Nintendo’s Switch to go on sale March 3 for US$300 (VIDEO) Bionic woman: Chinese robot turns on the charm Get the pink coins!

A senior member of Trump's transition team said the President-elect thought it would betray his populist-fuelled movement to have a presence at the gathering in the Swiss Alps. The group of billionaires and political leaders represents the power structure that fuelled the populist anger that helped Mr Trump win the presidential election, according to the source, who asked for anonymity. Related Content Inequality, jobless youth and social media: a combustible mix for 2017 US House votes to begin repealing Obamacare World Economic Forum founder Klaus Schwab met members of Mr Trump's staff in December. During his campaign, Mr Trump labelled his opponent, Democrat Hillary Clinton, a "globalist" and portrayed himself as a champion for the working class fighting an unfair economic system. Since the election, Mr Trump – who will be America's first billionaire president – has nominated for his cabinet two billionaires and about a dozen millionaires. Many in the upper ranks of his administration are from the world of finance.

To do this, companies and developers are implementing encryption into their programs. The issue, according to Google, is that there is no easy to use, generic way to identify and authenticate a user’s public encryption keys… Key Transparency is Google’s answer to this problem. With this project, Google is making it possible to identify and establish secure connections even through untrusted servers. To do this, Key Transparency is creating a lookup database with records of a user’s public encryption key and their “online personas” that have already been authenticated. In addition to this, there will be a public log with all record changes that is supposed to be tamper-proof. To make this generic and open solution work, the individual records have to be publically accessible by all. Fortunately, the only way to find a specific user’s information is by submitting a search for a particular ID. Just last month Google announced Project Wycheproof which is meant to help combat encryption security holes found in programs. With Key Transparency, Google will hopefully make it easier for developers to authenticate a user and establish an encrypted and secure connection with them. You can find more information about Key Transparency on Github or at KeyTransparency.org.

Roston - Jan 13, 2017 0 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Uber just got much more convenient, assuming you’re a Google Maps user, thanks to a new integration with Google’s navigation app. Rather than opening the Uber app and copying an address into the destination field, Google users can now find their location using Google Maps, then choose the small ride-hailing icon as the transportation method, enabling travelers to order an Uber car directly within the app. The video below shows the new integration for Uber specifically, but it works the same way for Lyft, as well. You should download the apps onto your mobile device and set them up before you try this, otherwise you’ll have to perform more steps. Once they’re added and setup, though, it’s as easy as searching for a location with Google Maps. Once you’ve selected a place, hit the circle button that pulls up the route options (the one in the bottom right side of the screen).

The Federal Trade Commission on Thursday held its second annual PrivacyCon event. The all-day gathering of academics, regulators, industry representatives and consumer advocates is designed to showcase the latest research on the privacy and security implications of emerging technologies. But the elephant in the room? That would be the merits of surveillance capitalism. Yesterday offered documentation aplenty of the growing threat to consumer privacy by new tech. Computer experts from labs at Princeton, USC, Northeastern, Penn State and Carnegie Mellon, among others, talked about the hidden privacy vulnerabilities of the smart home, the high feasibility (and invisibility) of cross-app tracking via nearby Bluetooth devices, and the exposure of personally identifiable information (PII) -- names and passwords in plain text -- by the world's most popular apps. PrivacyCon participants heard about the alarming disjunction between what privacy policies say and what the app or website actually does -- and about the 71% of mobile apps that apparently have no privacy policy at all, among them apps that collect PII. We learned that users, protective of their personal data, are happy to share friends' data in exchange for more personalized service; we are "privacy egoists," it seems. Those were just some of the alarms raised in the morning sessions I had time to watch online. The afternoon promised presentations on online behavioral advertising and on information security, including the ominous-sounding "Killed by Proxy: Analyzing Client-end TLS Interception." You can read all the papers on the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) PrivacyCon website. Right to be left alone "When it comes to privacy, technology has always presented a challenge," FTC Chairwoman Edith Ramirez said in her opening remarks at PrivacyCon. The challenge of reaping the benefits of technology while protecting privacy rights has been around since the introduction of Eastman Kodak's mass-produced snap camera in 1884, she noted. That may be so. But the threat posed by the popularity of Kodak's snap camera to a person's "right to be left alone," as the great Louis Brandeis and law partner Samuel Warren argued in their landmark paper "The Right to Privacy in America," pales beside the obliteration of consumer privacy from technologies of recent decades. The internet, smartphones and the internet of things (and its many manifestations to come, such as smart cars that measure driver emotion and vital signs, drones that fold up and fit in a pocket and robotic vacuum cleaners that double as security systems) are collecting intel on us at breakneck pace and in massive quantities. By 2020, experts say, we will see a growth rate of 4,300% in annual data generation. Anyone who wants to be left alone had better not go online or own a mobile phone. New risks Some of the societal benefits and consumer privacy risks of these new technologies are similar to ones we already know about, Ramirez said. Geolocation data, for example, can help ease horrendous traffic jams on morning commutes, but it should not be collected or used without a person's consent. Risks from unauthorized geolocation information include stalking; exposure of political, health and religious affiliations; and burglary. But there are new challenges, Ramirez said, among them the number of actors "collecting, compiling, interpreting and using data in a world that operates on big data, IoT and AI." The expanding list ranges from consumer-facing companies, device manufacturers and publisher websites to behind-the-scenes software vendors that connect IoT products to the internet to advertisers and analytics providers. "This vast array of entities makes it difficult to provide consumers with informed choices," she said. What does this mean for the FTC? The agency relies on PrivacyCon's cutting-edge research to identify areas for investigation and enforcement. Tech researchers brought to the FTC's attention the practices of InMobi and Turn, two companies that were the subject of recent FTC enforcement actions, Ramirez said. The mobile advertising network InMobi, the FTC alleged, tracked the locations of hundreds of millions of consumers without their knowledge or consent -- even consumers who set their privacy settings to deny access to their location. The general advertising firm Turn, she said, "deceived consumers by tracking them online and through their mobile applications even after consumers took steps to opt out of such tracking." The illegal acquisition of consumer data remains a type of consumer-privacy invasion the FTC and companies must continue to fight. Surveillance capitalism What does technology's assault on consumer privacy mean for CIOs? Invasion of consumer privacy has been going on perpetually for many reasons, but capitalism (i.e., trade) -- not criminal activity -- is perhaps the biggest driver. As companies expand their reach into the digital domain, new opportunities for finding the perfect customer arise and with them troves of data on private information, such as the buying habits and buying power of individuals. CIOs will be collecting and analyzing this data ever more often. At the same time, digitally connected employees are potentially revealing private company information on where they are travelling to, who are they talking to and what they are buying to snoops at competing companies.  Everyone is learning lots about everyone else. Deciding who has the right to know what, for which purposes and to whose benefit likely will fuel the agenda of many PrivacyCons to come.  CIO news roundup for the week of Jan. 9 Amazon to add 100,000 jobs over next 18 months. The Seattle-based e-commerce retailer said Thursday that the jobs would be full-time with full benefits and for people with various levels of experience, education and skill levels. Most of the new positions will be at warehouses under construction in Texas, California, Florida and New Jersey. "Innovation is one of our guiding principles at Amazon, and it's created hundreds of thousands of American jobs. … These jobs are not just in our Seattle headquarters or in Silicon Valley -- they're in our customer service network, fulfillment centers and other facilities in local communities throughout the country," Amazon founder and chief executive Jeff Bezos touted. Amazon will continue to invest in areas such as cloud technology, machine learning and advanced logistics. Amazon currently has 45,000 robots in some 20 fulfillment centers, a 50% increase from 2015. Altaba!? Following the completion of the $4.8 billion sale of its core internet business to Verizon, Yahoo will be renamed Altaba Inc., Yahoo said in an SEC filing Monday. Yahoo owns approximately 15% of Chinese online commerce company Alibaba, and the new name is a combination of the words alternative and Alibaba. As for the fate of the company's famous CEO? "Each of David Filo, Eddy Hartenstein, Richard Hill, Marissa Mayer, Jane Shaw and Maynard Webb has indicated that he or she intends to resign from the Board effective upon the Closing, and that his or her intention to resign is not due to any disagreement with the Company on any matter relating to the Company's operations, policies or practices," according to the filing. Mayer reportedly will not resign from her position as the chief executive. Google's autonomous minivans to hit the roads. Google's autonomous car division Waymo is set to launch a fleet of 100 self-driving Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid minivans on California and Arizona roads later this month. The autonomous vehicles are the result of a partnership between Google and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles announced in May 2016. Waymo is building self-driving technologies like sensors, cameras and mapping technology in-house, allowing the company to exert more control over its self-driving hardware. "We're serious about creating fully self-driving cars that can help millions of people, and to do that we have to oversee both the self-driving software and the self-driving hardware," Waymo CEO John Krafcik told the audience at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit on Sunday. Businesses at risk from old security models. A new survey researching IT security infrastructure revealed that 83% of businesses worldwide believe they are most at risk because of organizational complexities. The study conducted by Ponemon Institute and sponsored by Citrix surveyed 4,200 IT and IT security professionals worldwide. The survey found 74% of respondents believed it's time for their organizations to implement a new security framework, while 79% said they are concerned about security breaches that involve high-value information. Seventy-five percent of those surveyed said their organizations are not prepared to deal with the security risks rising from the internet of things. "The research reveals respondents' awareness of the need to challenge the status quo of their IT security strategies and consider a new IT security architecture to safeguard their organizations from cyber risks," Larry Ponemon, chairman and founder of the Ponemon Institute, said in a statement.

SiliconValley.com Twitter Facebook Google+ RSS   Social Web Mobile Cloud Gadgets Cleantech VC Data Games Policy Media   Google and Facebook gave more to Republicans than to Democrats: reports By Ethan Baron / January 13, 2017 at 4:23 PM In famously liberal Silicon Valley, two of the region’s biggest tech giants have switched teams to Republicans over Democrats while their workers remain largely on the left. In 2016, a year of fabulously polarizing American politics, the political action committees for Google and Facebook gave more money to the red team than to the blue for Congressional races. Of the $1.5 million from Google’s parent firm Alphabet, 56 percent went to Republican candidates and 44 percent to Democrats, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. That breaks down for House races as $625,000 for Republicans and $512,000 for Democrats, and for Senate races as $190,000 for Republicans and $137,000 for Democrats. Donations ranged from $1,000 to $10,000. Among those receiving $10,000 were southern California Republican Congressman Darrell Issa, who, according to CNBC on Jan. 11, has taken a position “firmly on the side of Silicon Valley” in the dispute between this region’s tech industry and federal authorities over encryption in consumer technology. Bay Area Democrat Kamala Harris, who won her Senate race, also received $10,000 from Alphabet’s PAC, called the “Google, Inc. NETPAC.” Facebook PAC gave a total of $517,000, with the same party breakdown as Google’s PAC: 56 percent to Republicans and 44 percent to Democrats. For the House, Republicans received $147,000 from the “Facebook, Inc. PAC,” while Democrats got $140,000. For the Senate, Republicans received $141,000 while Democrats got $91,000. Neither the campaign of Harris or her rival and fellow Democrat Loretta Sanchez received donations from Facebook’s PAC. Issa received $5,000. Democratic San Jose/Santa Clara Congresswoman Zoe Lofgren received $10,000. Apple, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, did not make donations through a PAC. The right turn by Google and Facebook suggests the firms see Republicans as stronger allies than Democrats, the New York Times reported. “As these technology firms have become corporate behemoths, their concerns over government regulatory policy have intensified — on issues including privacy, taxation, automation and antitrust,” according to the newspaper. But while the corporations are leaning rightward, those working in them remain generally leftist, the Times said. “Most tech executives and employees remain supportive of Democrats, especially on social and cultural issues,” according to the paper. “The Republican tilt of the PACs at … Google and Facebook suggests, however, that as these companies’ domains grow larger, their bottom-line interests are becoming increasingly aligned with the policies of the Republican Party.” Amazon and Microsoft have also swung to the right at a corporate level, the Times reported. “Microsoft has led the rightward charge,” the paper reported. “In 2008, the Microsoft PAC decisively favored Democrats, 60-40, according to … (the) Center for Responsive Politics. “By 2012, Republican candidates and committees had taken the lead, 54-46; and by 2016, the Microsoft PAC had become decisively Republican, 65-35.”   Photo: A man walks past a building on the Google campus in Mountain View.

The comments are another blow to the image of the country's airline industry after a video circulated online in December showing the apparently intoxicated pilot of a Citilink passenger plane. News reports this week said two pilots of another airline, Susi Air, owned by the country's fisheries minister had recently tested positive for drugs.

Earlier in the day he told the event attended by Bali's governor that a Lion Air pilot in the spectacular 2013 crash had "hallucinated" that the sea was part of the runway.

After the crash, which miraculously caused no fatalities among the 108 people on board, the transport ministry said the pilots had not tested positive for drugs. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Pin to Pinterest PIN Link A video captured a Citilink pilot staggering through security at Surabaya airport. Photo: YouTube The final report blamed the accident, which occurred in rain, on poor communication between the pilots and inadequate training. Lion Air, the National Transport Safety Committee and the Ministry of Transport declined to comment. Indonesian airlines were previously barred from flying to Europe and the United States but foreign air safety regulators have upgraded the country, allowing some airlines to resume flights. The US aviation regulator upgraded Indonesia's safety rating in August. However, the International Air Transport Association's former chief executive, Tony Tyler, who stepped down in June, said in 2015 he was very concerned about airline safety in Indonesia.

Google Play offers a so-called Private Channel feature that lets Google apps administrators host internal Android applications and control access to specific users or groups of users.  Organizations that set up a Private Channel on Google Play get additional benefits such as user authentication along with malware and virus detection. The updates announced this week will become available Jan. 31 and are designed to make enterprise applications distributed through Play Store more easily discoverable and accessible to end users. For instance, private apps will be relocated from the spot where they are currently located in Google Play to the "Work Apps" section of Play that is easier and quicker for users to navigate to. The same section will also contain all applications—both public and private—that the organization might be managing with an enterprise mobility management suite. "Our vision for "Work Apps" within Google Play is for it to become the single destination for corporate users to find all of the applications they need," Google said. "[Google] admins will be able to offer a curated set of both public and private applications specific to your enterprise for your employees." The scheduled update will also consolidate the controls for managing private and publicly available apps within Play Private Channel. Among other benefits, the consolidation will make it easier for administrators to create whitelists of mobile applications that are approved for use in the enterprise, Google said in its announcement. Organizations that have not previously used Google Play Private Channel to distribute enterprise applications will need to first enroll with an enterprise mobility management tool, including Google's own mobile management technology, according to the company. Google Play Private Channel currently can only be used to distribute internally developed Android enterprise applications on Android devices. Enterprises cannot use the feature to distribute either commercial or in-house applications running on other platforms. As with commercial applications on Play, enterprises have the option of charging for applications that they publish to the Private Channel. The scheduled updates continue the string of mostly incremental improvements that Google has been making to its enterprise mobility management products and services over the past 18 months or so. Last October for instance, Google introduced a new enrollment feature for letting administrators enroll Android mobile devices in bulk with all required security settings enforced. Google also announced updates to its mobile inventory management capabilities at the same time. Google has made similar tweaks to its Admin console for managing Android devices so users can more easily set-up and provision their devices in the workplace.           LATEST MOBILE ARTICLES   Google Simplifying Distribution of Custom Android Apps in Play Store Microsoft Power BI Reports Ready to Go Mobile Google Patent Supports Using Autonomous Vehicles for Ride-Sharing Google to Integrate Digital Assistant Technology With Android TVs Google to Integrate Android Apps With Fiat Chrysler In-Vehicle System                 Submit a Comment Loading Comments...   Manage your Newsletters: Login   Register My Newsletters eWeek Editor's Pick News & Views Cloud Computing Mobile and Wireless Update Best of eWeek eWeek Sunday Brunch eCareers Smart Moves Enterprise Applications Topic Center Update Enterprise IT Advantage eWeek Whitepaper Spotlight eWeek Labs eWeek Enterprise Update eWeek Storage Report Industry Center Update : Finance Industry Center Update : Government Industry Center Update : Health Care Infrastructure Topic Center Update Linux & Open Source Topic Center Update Mid-Market Solutions Securing the Enterprise VoIP Topic Center Update What's Hot Now eWeekend         News and Reviews Slideshows Google Open Sources Data Visualization Tool for Machine Learning Cisco Security Business Group Continues to Accelerate Growth Amazon Go Won't Kill Many Jobs, But It May Prove a Boon to Crooks Microsoft, Harman Kardon to Take on Amazon Echo, Google Home Yahoo Suffers New Hack; 1 Billion Users Impacted This Time 10 Things T-Mobile Has Done to Move O...

Lately, users have also been reporting an issue when transferring files from their Apple MacBooks using the stock Google Pixel USB-C to USB-A cable. After looking into the issue extensively, it would appear that it likely stems from Google’s Android File Transfer program which hasn’t been updated since 2012… This issue has been reported by dozens of people on XDA, Reddit (1, 2), Google’s Product Forums, and elsewhere across the web. After some testing, we were also able to replicate the problem but only when moving certain types of files to the Pixel from a variety of MacBook models. Some types of files and folders seem to transfer without any difficulty. This initially made us think that it was the Pixel’s cable, especially after trying other USB-C cables which — oddly enough — seem to work just fine. But after some additional testing showing that Google’s cable works perfectly fine with another file transfer application called HandShaker, it seems the issue actually might stem from Google’s four-year-old software. Digging into Google’s Android File Transfer program, you will find that it hasn’t been updated since October 15, 2012. This is obviously an extremely long time to not update something that so many Android users rely on to transfer data to and from their phones. This is obviously a small and minor bug in Google’s program that is only affecting a handful of users but it’s still one worth bringing to light. As the Android File Transfer program in question was last updated before USB-C was even publicly available, it might be time for the company to update the app to make sure everything still works properly. Google has stated on multiple occasions that USB-C is a standard that must be followed carefully with one of their own engineers being at the forefront of testing and reviewing cables found on Amazon. So whether it is the cable or the program (or some combination of the two) at fault, Google of all companies should give this problem some attention. Is anyone else in the community having this issue with the Pixel’s USB-C cable or a similar problem? Make sure to let us know. Guides Android Breaking news for Android.

Earlier in the day he told the event attended by Bali's governor that a Lion Air pilot in the spectacular 2013 crash had "hallucinated" that the sea was part of the runway.

After the crash, which miraculously caused no fatalities among the 108 people on board, the transport ministry said the pilots had not tested positive for drugs.

Lion Air, the National Transport Safety Committee and the Ministry of Transport declined to comment. Indonesian airlines were previously barred from flying to Europe and the United States but foreign air safety regulators have upgraded the country, allowing some airlines to resume flights. The US aviation regulator upgraded Indonesia's safety rating in August. However, the International Air Transport Association's former chief executive, Tony Tyler, who stepped down in June, said in 2015 he was very concerned about airline safety in Indonesia.

As well as getting comments noticed, it offers YouTubers a new way of monetizing their online activities. The idea is to connect content creators and fans during live stream events broadcast on the platform, during which viewers can interact with YouTubers by asking questions or leaving comments via a chat function. To boost visibility especially if there are hundreds or even thousands of people watching YouTube’s new “Super Chat” function will allow viewers to pay a few dollars to pin a message in pride of place at the top of the chat window. “Super Chat” messages will stay pinned at the top of the chat for up to five hours for maximum visibility, grabbing the attention of other viewers, as well as creators, who can reply at their leisure. Users choose the amount they pay to pin their “Super Chat” message. The more they pay, the longer the comment will be pinned. YouTube is already launching a beta with YouTube creators iHasCupquake (beauty, 5.2 million followers), Alex Wassabi (comedy, 2.2M) and Great Library (video games, 1.4M). The new service rolls out more widely from Tuesday, January 31 for creators in 20 countries looking to monetize their activities. “Super Chat” replaces “Fan Funding,” allowing viewers to make donations to YouTubers, which closes February 28. -Relaxnews regomoditswe RELATED ARTICLES Entertainment Jazz artist Thandi Klaasen dies aged 86 Entertainment Top DJ David Guetta’s Mumbai concert gets go-ahead TechknowAge Sony entertainment chief leaving to focus on Snapchat NO COMMENTS LEAVE A REPLY Cancel reply You must be logged in to post a comment.

He co-founded Android Inc. before selling it to Google in 2005, then ran it inside the search giant until 2013, when he switched to new projects at the company. Rubin left Google in 2014, started a tech incubator called Playground Global, and also apparently has been working on a smartphone. A new report surfaced today saying that Andy Rubin created a new company called Essential Products Inc., which will soon launch "a suite of consumer hardware products, including ones for the mobile and smart home", according to "people familiar with the matter". Essential has a 40-person team, and its registered trademark with the USPTO lists "smartphones, tablets, accessories, and computer operating software for mobile phones" as areas of focus. Andy Rubin next to the Android logo The key product to come out of Essential will be a high-end smartphone. This will sport a large edge-to-edge bezelless screen, as well as "the ability to gain new hardware features over time". This modularity will work through a proprietary magnetic connector "that serves double duty for charging the battery and expanding the phone's functionality". It will enable third-party modules, but Essential itself is working on a spherical camera add-on that shoots high-res 360-degree photos. At least one prototype of the phone has a bigger screen than Apple's 5.5" iPhone 7 Plus, but a smaller overall footprint because of its lack of bezels. The display could be pressure-sensitive like the ones in Apple's iPhones. As for materials used, the handset will have a metal frame and a ceramic back, thus sharing more than the bezelless display idea with the Xiaomi Mi Mix. The device will allegedly be out in the middle of this year for a price close or identical to what Apple and Google charge for their iPhones and Pixels. Foxconn is reportedly in talks to build the new phone. Rubin pitched the device to US mobile carrier executives at CES. It's still unclear if the handset will run Android.

The initiative was hosted by Digital Europe Working Group, of which Marlene Mizzi is a full member. It aimed at engaging the European institutions and IT companies in a discussion on how best to detect and disrupt terrorist-related activities on the internet and social media, and how to intensify the work of IT companies to counter terrorist propaganda. ADVERTISEMENT MEP Mizzi said that the use of the internet and social media is nowadays probably the most powerful tool for terrorists organisations to spread their propaganda, promote their ideologies, recruit people, collect funds and even coordinate attacks. “Avenues for radicalisation and the risks of domestic terrorism in Europe are growing with the spread of global terrorist networks using online platforms and messengers, such as Twitter or Facebook, for terrorist propaganda and communication. Their dependence on social networks suggests that without the internet and social media, terrorists organisations would not be able to spread their message virally,” said MEP Mizzi. MEP Mizzi is convinced that social media and internet should be used to our advantage to implement counter-terrorist techniques, that can help us maintain public safety by preventing terrorism, protecting the public from it and pursuing its perpetrators. One such strategy is the recently announced Code of Conduct on Illegal Online Hate Speech and Internet Forum through which private companies have agreed together with the Commission to remove content from the internet, which they consider illegal. Marlene Mizzi said that whilst such initiatives seem like a good idea, the question remains how far private companies can go against the backdrop of radically changing technology and public attitudes towards surveillance, fundamental rights and law enforcement. In this regard, MEP Mizzi said that a strong regulatory framework at European level can help constrain the use of internet by jihadi organisations, strengthen de-radicalisation efforts, and limit their access to funding. "Furthermore, once the online platforms and companies spot an illegal terrorist content they must immediately flag it to the responsible national and European authorities for further investigation," commented Marlene Mizzi.   <a href='http://ads.independent.com.mt/www/delivery/ck.php?n=a1549226&amp;cb=247' target='_blank'><img data-src='http://ads.independent.com.mt/www/delivery/avw.php?zoneid=21&amp;cb=247&amp;n=a1549226' border='0' alt='' /></a> <a href='http://ads.independent.com.mt/www/delivery/ck.php?n=afd78ad2&amp;cb=188' target='_blank'><img data-src='http://ads.independent.com.mt/www/delivery/avw.php?zoneid=92&amp;cb=188&amp;n=afd78ad2' border='0' alt='' /></a> don't miss <a href='http://ads.independent.com.mt/www/delivery/ck.php?n=a900f44e&amp;cb=136' target='_blank'><img data-src='http://ads.independent.com.mt/www/delivery/avw.php?zoneid=20&amp;cb=136&amp;n=a900f44e' border='0' alt='' /></a> News Cash stolen in hold-up from Qormi shop Updated: Woman dies in blaze at her… PM Muscat forecasts 'record levels' for… Two African migrants ordered to leave… Sicilian man pleads guilty for string… Hungarian man imprisoned for 18 months… New tuna pen spotted off St Paul’s… Elderly woman mugged while on her way… open Terms of Use Advertising Rates Contact Us Designed and developed by Alert eBusiness Independent Online. ©2017.

Wank on, America. Offices all over the country are offering crazy perks to attract employees.  From free lunch to Friday night beers, office perks are definitely nice.  Google has its own shuttle to take employees to work, as well as early screenings of movies.  Disney allegedly has a huge cafeteria full of dispensers of candy and your favorite cereals.  But the newest trend in office perks could prove to put folks in a sticky situation. Sticky because they will be covered with sperm and/or vaginal juices. That's right, masturbation is what's on the menu at work these days.  According to a recent survey, 40% of people masturbate during the work day.  HOW HAVE I NEVER ONCE WALKED IN ON SOMEONE ENTERING THE PLEASURE ZONE THEN, SURVEY? Giphy​ I've only ever masturbated at one job.  Well, two, if you count this one. The first one I was literally the only person in the building, in my early twenties, single and dripping raw sex, so frankly that fact that the craziest thing I did during this time was to masturbate in the bathroom is actually a bit of a relief. I haven't technically masturbated while on the clock for YourTango, but I mean, I work from home, so technically yes, masturbation has occurred in my workplace.  Still, if ever there was a job where I'd feel comfortable testing this theory, it's this one.  Hygiene and social mores aside, there are actually a lot of benefits to jerking one out (by which I mean masturbating) at the office. Though we have to warn you, of course, that masturbating at work could theoretically be considered sexual harassment — if someone walked in on you or you did it up in other people's space. But assuming you do it right, psychologist Mark Sergeant says that masturbating at work is a great way to "relief stress and tension." Plus it's so much more fun than a brisk walk around the block.  Life coach Cliff Arnall thinks masturbating at work might have even more great benefits: "I would expect a masturbation policy to result in more focus, less aggression, higher productivity, and more smiling." I mean, I can't disagree, but like, wouldn't you get the same results from giving your employees free chocolate? And the added benefit of eliminating the awkwardness of everyone knowing that Terry from accounting is looking chipper because he's just finished jerking it in the men's room? Still, I guess subbing in masturbation for cupcakes or other free snacks could have its perks.  Fewer calories, for one thing.  Giphy The big concern for me would be actually being able to reach an orgasm. It's one thing to masturbate freely in your own home, it's another thing entirely to masturbate within the confines of your workplace, where your boss could at any second burst through the door. Trying to take a masturbation break at work and then being unable to orgasm could, if anything, be the exact opposite of a restorative break.  Though I guess practices could, in theory, make perfect. By which I mean masturbation practice.  "Just make sure you wash your hands," said one editor as we discussed the finer points of this story.  Noted editor, noted.  10 Celebrities Who Love To Brag About Masturbation Click to view (10 images) Photo: Sony Pictures Michael HollanBlogger Buzz Read Later   like us on facebook If you 'like' us, we'll LOVE you!

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Saturday, 14 January 2017 | MYT 11:00 AM Android Wear 2.0 and standalone apps expected February 2017 Brought forward: Android Wear 2.0 was initially expected in fall 2016. — Google Inc Google has announced the upcoming release of its Android Wear 2.0 smartwatch operating system early in February in an email to developers. Initially expected in fall 2016, this OS update is packed with new functions for owners of recent generations of compatible smartwatches.  The key new feature is the arrival of standalone applications, which can be installed directly on the wearable and function without connection to a smartphone. There won't be many of these apps available to try when Android Wear 2.0 launches, but they promise to be particularly useful, with Foursquare (location-based recommendations), Glide (video messaging) and Lifesum (health).  The developers' e-mail goes on to mention a new integrated Play Store for browsing the new applications directly from a wearable, rather than using a smartphone.  Android Wear 2.0 brings a new interface with, for example, a reworked notifications system, offering additional content and actions. Plus, Android Wear 2.0 users can enjoy more onscreen info with more options for customizing what's displayed (time, temperature, number of steps, etc). This version of Android Wear also brings new eagerly awaited interactions, such as a veritable onscreen keyboard and handwriting recognition for writing messages with your finger, for example.  As with the smartphone version of Android, Android Wear 2.0 is likely to roll out progressively, coming to different brands and models at different times. Android Wear notably powers the Moto 360, the Huawei Watch, the LG Watch Urbane, the Asus ZenWatch 3 and the Sony SmartWatch 3. Most of these models should be in line for the update. Samsung, on the other hand, has its own in-house operating system called Tizen.  The roll-out could also be accompanied by Google's first own-brand smartwatches, currently known under their codenames "Swordfish" and "Angelfish." — AFP Relaxnews You May Be Interested Boosting women's libido Glass discards now included in waste separation law Better rates via online forex services Paying high interest rates for personal loans Purple should be your favourite CNY colour Chinese herb Dang Shen helps to boost strength Others Also Read Man City's title hopes hit by Lukaku and Everton teens DBKL to add maintenance fees to business licence Do we really need to fear China money? advertisement Latest News Sci-fi tech set for 2017 QLED vs OLED PCs on the rise Startup pays real people to answer questions to build better AI Dell Vostro 14: Value for money Most Viewed in Tech PCs on the rise Dell Vostro 14: Value for money Could your gadgets send you to jail?

Yahoo(w)oes! Sat, 2017-01-14 09:45  editor United Kingdom Hemantha Abeywardena writes from London… As what is left of the reputation of the internet pioneer, Yahoo, oscillates widely between confirmation and denial of its new name, Altaba – alternative to Alibaba, the Chinese online giant – billions of Yahoo email users, in addition to its corporate clients at many different levels, are bracing themselves for anxious times ahead while biting nails over the fate of their corresponding email addresses. At present, the Yahoo email users have to go through never-ending login issues, especially when accessing their emails via their smartphones or tablets, bypassing Yahoo mail site. Although, Yahoo may cite security concerns at the root of the issue - and it may be true to some extent, given the hacking involving over a billion accounts in 2013 – the possibility of making attempts to force customers to its mail page in order to appease its dwindling crowd of advertisers cannot to ruled out. Yahoo, the search engine that once was almost synonymous with the internet, has been on a downward spiral for years with frequent arrivals and departures of CEOs, who failed to turn things around. Against this backdrop, the arrival of the present CEO, Marissa Mayer, in 2012 was hailed as that of a Messiah. At that time, not only did media become obsessed with her impressive CV, but also the photogenic look of the blonde too, while occasionally making reference to her toned physique, when they had nothing else left to write about. Unfortunately, judging by her performance, she has been a square peg in the round hole: bloated acquisitions, missing out on social media – remember Yahoo Messenger – e-commerce and of course, the stampede of talented executives to get out, finally took its toll on the company on her watch, which ultimately saw the end of Yahoo functioning as an independent company, when Verizon decided to take over Yahoo’s core business last year. By the time Ms Mayer call it a day to experimenting, over $2billion of Yahoo capital had been spent, despite the brand name slowly approaching the precipice of irrelevance. Growing dissent among the shareholders, meanwhile, may have forced Ms Mayer to face the inevitable – selling its core internet business to Verizon. Ms Mayer, a former Google vice president, landed at Yahoo with great fanfare in 2012. Tech analysts thought that she came with a silver bullet, based on her experience and technical knowledge while serving at Google. Unfortunately, she soon proved that she was no better than the army of Chief Executives who came and left in quick succession at the helm of the company. In short, Ms Mayer couldn’t grasp the enormity of the challenge before her. Yahoo, now a mere shadow of its former self, underestimated the meteoric rise of Google in its early days on search front. Adding insult to injury, the top executives neither managed to come up with a search algorithm on their own to beat Google at its own game nor saw an avenue to shine in a different path. When things were going from bad to worse, Yahoo started spreading in too many directions in the name of diversification in the hope of searching for luck – a failed strategy mocked as peanut butter manifesto by the seasoned analysts. That seemed to be the final nail of the coffin as far as Yahoo as an independent company was concerned. When we look back on what happened at Yahoo on Ms Mayer’s watch, it is clear that she didn’t have a vision to turn the company around. Nor did she feel the need of one closer to her for the sake of the survival of the company. Alarmingly, she is not the only CEO with this essential ingredient missing in the technical world. Fortunately, there are still visionary CEOs in the world, although they are few and far between, for the CEOs in Ms Mayer’s enviable position to look up to: Jeff Bezos of Amazon, Elon Musk of Tesla and Brian Chesky of Airbnb and the likes are still delivering a yeomen service to mankind while playing their corresponding roles in extending the technological progress at impressive speed. Despite the availability of plenty of mail alternatives to Yahoo, the mail users are concerned about the fate of their mail addresses, in the event of something unthinkable takes place at Yahoo - Unfortunately, it, a free service, is not going to be one of the priorities to be taken up by Ms Mayer in the next few months.

Zipline Share Share Tweet Share Email Print Comment advertisement You've just exited a scenic stretch of twisty mountain roads when suddenly the view's no longer scenic: A tourist bus has tipped over and slipped into a gully, evidently just minutes before. After pulling over, you call 911. Soon after, as you're searching your car for supplies, a flashing light appears overhead, accompanied by a buzzing sound. You look skyward to see that a helping hand has come to the rescue; an EMS response drone drops from the heavens deux ex machina. The 3-feet-tall, 6-feet-diameter octo-copter has been automatically guided to your location using your smartphone's GPS coordinates. An EMS response drone Dennis Lott / Hinds Community College It lands nearby, carrying a kit stuffed with meds, gauze and bandages, a chest seal, clotting sponges, scissors, and tourniquets. As you rummage through it, a video screen inside lights up and a face appears. "I'm an emergency care physician. I'm here to help." EMS Response Drones Such a futuristic scenario will become reality soon if Dr. Italo Subbarao, senior associate dean at William Carey University College of Osteopathic Medicine in Hattiesburg, Miss., has anything to do with it. In December, Subbarao and a medical student demonstrated how two new disaster drones they've developed could deliver 'telemedical' packages to victims and rescue personnel in a simulated mass-casualty event. EMS response drones can land in places that EMS ground vehicles either cannot get to or take too long to reach, says Subbarao, a recognized expert in disaster and emergency medicine: "Immediate communications with the victims and reaching them rapidly with aid are both critical to improve outcomes." A user demonstrates Google Glass. Justin Sullivan / Getty Images file "A telemedical drone is the bridge that can deliver life-saving treatment directly to the victims, giving remote physicians eyes, ears, and voice to instruct anyone on site." Through Google Glass, Subbarao states, the physician can see what a wound looks like, the exact nature of the injury, and then guide willing bystanders through the appropriate treatments in real time. "Drones have been used for awhile to get eyes on disaster scenes fast, so we thought, 'Why not integrate medical intervention as well?' he says. "Why can't we use drones to deliver telemedical packages? Not just bandages and blood, or even a defibrillator, but on-site medical expertise, to give people on the scene a real medical intervention capability?" One HiRO (Health Integrated Rescue Operations) package is designed to provide help for a severely injured victim, another is intended for up to 100 people with significant to minor injuries, the kind that characterizes mass-casualty events. Related: This App is Revolutionizing Diagnoses of Rare Diseases Drone experts from nearby Hinds Community College, with advice from the researchers, designed and built the disaster drones, which are equipped to fly in bad weather. "These drones have impressive lift and distance capability, and can carry a variety of sensors, including infrared devices, to help locate victims in the dark," says Dennis Lott, director of Hinds CC's unmanned aerial vehicle program. Lott notes that any progress toward EMS response drone technology remains limited by Federal Aviation Administration 'Part 107' regulations that currently restrict most privately owned drones to a maximum weight of 55 pounds, an altitude ceiling of 400 feet, and line-of-sight operations, that is, within visible range. The FAA, which favors a gradual approach, is granting more operational waivers of late, but, he concedes, "we need to get beyond line-of-sight to using GPS guidance to direct the drones to the coordinates of the emergency call." Related: Will the Future of Tech Be a 'Disaster' Under Trump? Lott believes some progress was made recently when the FAA finally defined the regulations, "but it's still early days," he says. On the technical side, "the drones need to be able to sense and avoid obstacles on their own, to detect and evade any problems" that might arise far from home base. "In any case, we think it's just a matter of time before drone technology is universally adopted for emergency and disaster response." The Mississippi telemedi-drone team is not the only one thinking about the potentially life-saving technology. Last April, Google received a U.S. patent that outlines a device that can deploy drones to handle specific medical emergencies by carrying specific medical equipment to victims. Users need only press a button to call for help. Flying Zipline For Blood Supplies Along the same lines, Zipline International of Half Moon Bay, Calif., in partnership with the Rwanda government, has begun the "world's first" drone delivery of blood supplies and drugs across the heavily forested and mountainous East African country, says company spokesman Justin Hamilton. Zipline co-founder Keller Rinaudo, who started the company some five years ago, got the idea when he visited a Tanzanian health institute. A researcher there had a database that enabled rural health stations to send text alerts whenever they needed blood or other medical supplies. "Sadly, it was really just a 'database of death' because few of the requests could be filled in time due to bad roads, particularly during the rainy season," Hamilton explains. Members of the Zipline team pose with the company's drones. Zipline Rinaudo and his co-founders thereafter set out to invent a way to deliver meds to remote clinics and hospitals on demand. The Silicon Valley start-up tasked its team of top aerospace engineers and military drone specialists with developing fast, long-range, airplane-type drones. The current aircraft can transport a 3-pound, parachute-equipped cardboard box more than 95 miles on a single battery charge. "That's two units of blood plus meds — enough to save a life," Hamilton says. "One of the engineers told me: 'I used to build drones that drop bombs, now I build drones that drop blood.' " Today, several hospitals can order blood or meds via text and have it delivered within 30 minutes. Zipline gets a fee for each delivery. The drones, which operate like military UAVs, navigate using GPS and Rwanda's cellular network. "Each drone, which is about the size of an adult with arms outstretched, will soon be making 50 to 150 transfusion deliveries a day to 21 clinics across the western half of Rwanda," Hamilton says. More Medical Drones in the Air Other similar medical drone efforts exist. Menlo Park, Calif.-based Matternet, for example, collaborated with UNICEF to deliver HIV-testing kits using drones, which shortened the time required to test infants living in rural Malawi. And Flirtey, an Australian drone maker, partnered up with NASA to fly a drone carrying medicine to a pop-up clinic in Virginia run by the Remote Area Medical program. It made three trips in 30 minutes and transported 10 pounds of medicine. Two years ago engineers at TU Delft in the Netherlands tested a medical drone designed to promptly deliver an AED defibrillator directly to heart attack victims who make an emergency phone call, whereas UPS and other big commercial delivery drone developers are experimenting with adding medical drops to their regular routes. Medevac Ambulance Drone Still other drone pioneers are thinking even bigger. Veteran aerospace engineer and inventor, Rafi Yoeli, had always wanted to build a flying car, but when he finally started his own company in 2001, he realized that modeling the concept as an aerial rescue vehicle would make for a much more marketable product. Another decade or so later, Yoeli, now CEO of Urban Aeronautics in Israel, is nearly five years and some 200 flights into testing the Cormorant UAV, an unmanned flying ambulance (or flying jeep) prototype designed to deliver supplies to hard-to-reach or hazardous locations, and then medevac battle casualties and disaster victims out of danger. "The concept of flying jeeps had always been undoable for lack of lightweight engine power," says Rafi Yoeli's wife, Janina Frankel Yoeli, who serves as the company's VP for marketing. But small turbine engines have become much more powerful over time. Add in her husband's innovation and determination, and the result is the Cormorant UAV. The compact, ducted-fan drone design can get in and out of tight spaces inaccessible to helicopters because its rotors are enclosed in protective cylindrical cowls that keep them from striking trees or power lines, she explains. The ducts also muffle rotor noise, making the flying ambulance quieter than an equivalent helicopter. The UAV's novel layout features a central patient's cabin sandwiched between powerful gas turbine engines. The engines drive an electric generator that powers electric motors in the large-diameter, fore and aft vertical rotors, and in two rear-mounted drive fans, making it a hybrid-electric vehicle not unlike a flying Toyota Prius. Related: How Computers are Learning to Predict the Future Special vanes on the ducts, Janina says, provide thrust outlets for creating control power in hover — the side forces that maintain stability and orientation. "In forward motion, the vehicle gains lift because the front duct vanes act like wings as does the fuselage which serves as a lifting body." The Cormorant UAV is now ready for full-scale development and production, she states. The Israeli military and other defense and emergency medical organizations have shown interest. "We're doing flight-control refinements now," she says, "we expect to begin deliveries within 4 years." Disposable Delivery-Drones Then there are DARPA's paper-airplane delivery drones that melt away into the countryside after landing. The ICARUS program (for Inbound, Controlled, Air-Releasable, Unrecoverable Systems) envisions small unpowered and unmanned gliders made of cardboard to air-drop small critical packages for forward-deployed forces. During the summer, DARPA selected the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center in California, and DZYNE Technologies in Fairfax, Va., to manufacture the disposable, disappearing drones. The vanishing UAVs will be able to deliver a 3-pound package containing meds, food, supplies, or ammo to a GPS-programmed location with a 33-foot accuracy. The programmed aircraft, which will be developed to operate at night, must be able to vanish within four hours of arrival, leaving only unrecognizable remnants no larger than 100 microns — or about the width of a human hair.

Many employees at these tech giants enjoy large paychecks and a host of perks ranging from free dry cleaning to free food to gyms on site. But there are thousands of other people working alongside them who don’t make enough money to afford housing near their jobs so many sleep in their cars between shifts. Some sleep in their cars because they are homeless. Watch the Diane Sawyer report, "My Reality: A Hidden America," in a special edition of ABC News "20/20" on Friday, Jan. 13 at 10 p.m. ET Terrence Rollins is a 51-year-old bus driver who drives the shuttles that ferry tech employees across Silicon Valley to company campuses. He only has a few hours a night at home before he has to be back at work. “I love my job,” Rollins said. “I get up at 3 [a.m.], I make it home about 11, 10 o’clock at night, and I’m constantly traveling. I mean, I have to take care of my family.” The bus drivers who spoke with ABC News starting in 2015 work for independent contractors hired by tech companies. When we first met these drivers, they said their jobs provided few benefits and didn't offer paid company holidays. Some drivers are contracted to work what’s called a “split shift,” meaning they arrive for work at 6 a.m. to take tech employees to their offices, then have to wait around for a number of hours, unpaid, until it’s time to take the employees back home at the end of the day. These drivers work and are paid for a total of eight hours but over a 16-hour period. They said the houses they can afford on their wages are too far away for them to get home between shifts, so many of them stay in their cars or nap at the bus depot. In the bus depot where he is based, Rollins said there was one room with two beds for female drivers and another room with two beds for male drivers. But it wasn't enough to accommodate the 35 to 40 drivers there on any given day. “It’s just awful when you park inside and you have drivers covering their cars’ [windows] with blankets and towels,” said another driver named Jimmy. Since ABC News began this report a year and a half ago, some service workers have unionized and their employers have worked with tech companies to raise wages and offer better benefits to many contract workers who lived at the edge of poverty. These workers are an example of a growing trend in the U.S., in which large corporations contract out service jobs from other companies. Scott Peebles, another driver ABC News spoke to in 2015, said he had been sleeping on an air mattress in his car for months. Peebles used a windshield reflector to help block out the light from the parking lot streetlamps while he slept. “This is foreign to me,” he said, gesturing to his car. “It’s not the way you’re supposed to live. No, it’s just a mirror of society that we’re in right now and that’s -- I’m probably part of millions of people that are doing this.” “It’s sad that it comes down to this,” Peebles continued. “I mean, if people would know this, if corporations of businesses they work for, they would probably be aghast that their employees were living in a car or a van.” At night, if they needed a restroom, the drivers would get out of their cars and walk into the bus depot. Under union pressures and publicity about drivers receiving few benefits, Facebook now requires contractors to pay contract employees a minimum of $15 an hour, 15 days of paid time off, and a $4,000 stipend for new parents if their contractors don’t provide parental leave. Apple and Google followed suit with announcing 25 percent wage increases for all drivers. Many security jobs are also now contracted out. Michael Johnson, who worked as a security guard for several companies, told ABC News the job has changed over the years. “When I first started there were paid vacation, paid holidays, lots of times we got bonuses,” Johnson said. “It was like a regular job, it’s just that you were contract-working. You were treated like one of the gang.” Eventually, Johnson said at the time he stopped receiving paid vacation time or paid sick leave and the hourly rate dropped. “It was incredible what was happening,” he said. “It seemed like it just happened overnight.” In Silicon Valley, amidst the luxury homes, the streets are lined with service workers who live in RVs and trailers. “The folks that are living in these RVs, they are part of the low-wage economy that’s created around the tech industry,” said activist Derecka Mehrens. “There’s a real connection between these families and what happens in the industry.” Some experts on contract workers say some of the jobs provide opportunities that didn’t exist before. Arthur Brooks of the Conservative American Enterprise Institute said,many workers "say that it gives them flexibility. Many of them are immigrants.” But Tamara Draut, Vice President of Demos, a progressive think tank, disagreed that contracting and subcontracting helps workers, arguing that “in each link down that chain, the pressures grow to lower labor costs.” Irma Alvarado is 72 years old and says she spent her life cleaning the offices at Visa, working the night shift from 6 p.m. to 2:30 a.m. She shares a small house with her children and grandchildren. She is a legal immigrant who says she has lived and worked in the U.S. nearly 30 years. When ABC News spoke to her in 2015, Alvarado said it was hard to watch Visa employees throw away food she would love to have and to see them take vacations. She said she once saw a $7,000 check lying on a desk, and was surprised at the gap between her pay and theirs. In a statement to ABC News, Visa said their janitorial staff is contracted through a third party vendor. “All wages, bonuses and benefits are handled directly by the service vendors,” the statement said. “We greatly appreciate their work and dedication to our facilities.” Her grandchildren say they still believe in the American dream. Her grandson Danny said he would like to be an astronaut one day. But for now, he said he just wants a drawer to himself. “It’s hard living in the house because you don’t have that much room, gets crowded,” he said. “I would have a drawer to put all my clothes in.” About half of American adults lived in middle-income households in 2014, according to a new Pew Research Center analysis of government data. Pew Research offers an income calculator feature on their website that allows you to see whether you are part of the American middle class. 0 Shares Email Star Comments " Bus Drivers Ferrying Silicon Valley Tech Elite Struggle to Afford Rent +Why Thousands of Low-Income Americans 'Donate' Their Blood Plasma +When Working 2 Fast Food Jobs, 16 Hours a Day Still Isn't Enough " Reince Priebus Calls John Lewis' Criticism of Trump 'Irresponsible' " CIA Director Warns Trump: Be 'Very Disciplined' With Public Remarks " Meet Thumbelina, a Tiny Chihuahua Who Weighs Only 1.54 Pounds " 8-Year-Old Battling Cancer Gets Birthday Wish to See Amazon Facility " Twin's Mom Reacts to Emotional Reunion: 'It Didn't Feel Real' " Man Finds Forgotten Lotto Ticket, Wins $1 Million " Newlyweds Nail Iconic 'Dirty Dancing' Routine at Wedding " 2 Women Share How They Collectively Lost 100s of Pounds " Americans Think Obama, Kennedy, Reagan Gave Best Inaugural Speeches " Standing in for the Incoming President and First Lady at Inauguration Rehearsal " Jennifer Holliday Pulls Out of Trump's Inauguration After Backlash President Obama's Inauguration Day Plans " 5 Takeaways From Scathing Department of Justice Report on Chicago Policing " When Working 2 Fast Food Jobs, 16 Hours a Day Still Isn't Enough " Paris Jackson Pleased, 'Surprised' Network Canceled Michael Jackson Episode

Even carriers that promise unlimited bandwidth often pin an asterisk to the end of that statement that reminds us that they don't really mean that. Google's new image compression tool might just help save you some of those precious 4G bytes. I'd like to introduce you to Google's most recent application of its machine-learning technology RAISR, or Rapid and Accurate Image Super-Resolution. RAISR upsampling takes a thumbnail of an image and uses machine-learning algorithms to try and figure out what detail went into the original, larger version. This in turn allows Google to serve upsampled images that use up to 75% less bandwidth of the original, while still retaining most the visual detail. Right now, Google is only applying the technology to its Google+ service, and even then only to a subset of the images on the service. This will change as Google starts to roll the technology out to more of its services "in the coming weeks." If you've been watching HBO's Silicon Valley, this looks a bit like life imitating art. There's no word if Google is going to keep this technology for itself or release it to the public like Brotli, but it'd be neat to see it used in other image-heavy services like Facebook and Amazon.   Tags: Multimedia Internet Networking User name:  Password:  Remember me Register Tip: You can use the A/Z keys to walk threads.

He hopes to go into the defense industry, and wants to work on an airplane or spacecraft. Photo: Marcus Yam, TNS Aerospace firms start recruiting in prekindergarten 1 / 1 Back to Gallery University of Southern California mechanical engineering junior Stephanie Balais developed a passion for aerospace after joining the university’s AeroDesign team and helping to construct an airplane fuselage hours before transporting the plane to a competition in Kansas. As internships beckoned, she applied to many top defense and aerospace firms. But Microsoft Corp. snagged her first. This summer, Balais, 20, will spend 13 weeks in Redmond, Wash., working in the tech giant’s manufacturing and supply chain department. Silicon Valley and other tech centers have always been popular landing places for young engineers, with their lure of cutting-edge technology and top-notch pay. But aerospace companies are facing an even stiffer challenge as Web and computer companies, and other sectors like the auto industry, move into areas like drones and autonomous systems. Aerospace employers are realizing they have to dig deeper to capture top tech talent. They are starting to reach out earlier to potential employees — as early as elementary school or even prekindergarten — to get them interested in science and math. And they’re recognizing the challenge they have in building awareness with people from a generation that never had a real space race, but grew up with Google, Snapchat and Apple as part of their daily lives. “This is something that’s very critical to our member companies,” said Dan Stohr, spokesman for the Aerospace Industries Association trade group. “They’re putting serious money into this, to the tune of millions of dollars a year.” Lockheed Martin Corp. has started a program called Generation Beyond to encourage middle school students to study deep space exploration. It includes a class curriculum, a Mars weather app and a traveling school bus modified so that children riding it can see the Martian landscape through the windows. “One of the things we’ve been seeing is that this generation of students doesn’t necessarily know (about) Lockheed Martin, as their parents did,” said Steve Hatch, the company’s director for central talent acquisition, of current college students. In early 2015, Northrop Grumman Corp. opened an innovation center called NG Next in Redondo Beach (Los Angeles County), where it is doubling down on basic research to find solutions to problems that may be years in the future. The organization takes a more aggressive approach to experimentation, which can be attractive to potential employees looking for a creative work environment. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, about 26,000 aerospace engineers were employed as of May 2015 in product and parts manufacturing, a category that covers about 70 percent of the aerospace and defense industry. Joining them were about 5,900 electrical engineers, about 14,000 mechanical engineers and 12,000 developers of systems software. In computer and electronic product manufacturing, there were about 5,700 aerospace engineers, 30,300 electrical engineers, 18,400 mechanical engineers and 48,600 software developers of systems software. Defense firms have long maintained a presence on college campuses, whether at career fairs, sponsoring student engineering competitions, serving on advisory boards or providing scholarships. “Students encounter Google and Amazon frequently on the Web,” said Jayathi Murthy, dean of UCLA’s Engineering School. “So in order for (defense companies) to be heard above that, they really need to engage with us on campus, and they do.” A meeting with a Northrop Grumman executive during a USC recruiting event piqued Justin Jameson’s interest in working at the company. It ended up being the only place he applied to after graduating from USC in 2009. Jameson, 29, has now worked at Northrop Grumman for more than seven years. “I looked at a lot of the big consulting companies as well, but at Northrop Grumman, they offered me the chance to come in and work on real problems,” he said. “At a consulting company, I would be solving someone else’s problems.” That aspect attracted Addison Salzman, 21, who will graduate from USC in May with a degree in aerospace engineering. Salzman, who is interested in higher-level aircraft design, has already landed a full-time job at Boeing Co. and will start in July. “One of the big reasons that I chose it is because they have their hands in not just defense, but they have a very large commercial airplanes business,” he said. “It gives me a cool opportunity to explore the different applications of aerospace technologies.” Timothy John, an aerospace engineering student at UCLA, has been interested in space exploration since elementary school and has sent out a number of job applications to defense companies. John, 25, said he’s looking for longevity and growth in potential employers, but also hopes to work on an airplane or spacecraft. “I’m pretty indiscriminate,” he said. “Any projects that include planes, like anything with a jet turbine, like a F-16 or F-22 or stealth bombers. Or even missiles.” Though Northrop Grumman’s NG Next was not established specifically for recruiting, it has become a useful tool in hiring, Hernandez said. New employees can be part of an environment of rapid development and experimentation not generally associated with large defense contractors. “For us to achieve the great things that we need to achieve to solve the nation’s toughest problems, we have to push hard,” Hernandez said. The organization’s four main components — basic research, applied technology, advanced design and rapid prototyping — employ about 800 full- or part-time people, though faculty from research universities can also collaborate with NG Next scientists. The organization was also designed to have a larger tolerance for risk than what might be assumed for a big government contractor. “We want to move fast and hard, cautiously and consciously, but it’s OK if we fail every now and then,” Hernandez said, voicing a credo that aerospace engineers say held for the space program long before it became popular in Silicon Valley. “If we don’t, we’re probably not pushing hard enough.” Samantha Masunaga is a Los Angeles Times writer.

Five killings are directly linked to him but in a 1974 letter, one in a series of taunting missives to Bay Area newspapers, the Zodiac indicated the number was actually 37. And then, silence. The case went ice cold. It is one of the nation's most notorious unsolved cases. Until — possibly — now. In November, more than two dozen cold-case investigators convened in Oakland to learn if a new Pittsburgh-based tip in the case was worth pursuing. Did a handwriting sample of a northern California man, submitted by his suspicious daughter, match that of the Zodiac Killer? They wanted to know. Nationally renowned handwriting expert Michelle Dresbold of the East End told them there are so many similarities, many of them quite unusual, in what she could compare between the handwriting samples of the Zodiac and the father that further investigation is definitely warranted. "There is enough — more than enough — to consider this valid," she told the excited group. The investigators plan to get right back on the case — now that a new semester has begun at the University of Pittsburgh. The amateur sleuths are members of Pitt's Students Conquering Cold Cases club. Ms. Dresbold's presentation was their last meeting of the fall semester. They'll resume examining the Zodiac case and others as the spring semester begins this month. The members, who must meet certain academic and other criteria, plan careers in law, law enforcement and similar fields, and hone their analytic skills in tackling unsolved cases. Recognized by the university in the 2015 fall semester as an official organization, the club has as its goal uncovering leads police can use to bring a sense of closure to victims' families. They are guided by retired Pittsburgh Police Cmdr. Ronald Freeman, who headed the city police violent crimes section and was involved with a cold case unit that included Pittsburgh and Allegheny County homicide detectives and the FBI. Now an adjunct professor at Pitt, he agreed to be the club's sponsor. In addition to the Zodiac Killer, the amateur investigators have taken on baffling cold cases such as the 2012 disappearance of 21-year-old Lebanon County woman, the 2005 Christmas Eve murder of a 94-year-old Beaver County woman and the 1993 slaying of a 74-year-old Westmoreland County woman. "I think back to meetings with cold-case detectives and while the difference is (club members) don't have the training and background in policing, they have the same enthusiasm and desire to solve these cases," Mr. Freeman said. "It's surprising how really good they are at this. I'm really impressed with their skills and abilities." ZODIAC INVESTIGATION Twenty-five students — 19 of them women — sit at circular tables in Room 231 of Pitt's Lawrence Hall on Nov. 30. They are excited to learn if Ms. Dresbold holds any hope for them to further investigate the Zodiac, the subject of numerous books and several movies including the 2007 eponymous-named film starring Jake Gyllenhaal, Mark Ruffalo and Robert Downey Jr. Each student has a laptop open in front of them that they use for taking notes, conducting Google searches and using social media to expand upon what Ms. Dresbold tells them. They use computers so much in their work that they are momentarily flummoxed when Ms. Dresbold asks them to take out a piece of paper for an exercise. "Every little thing you put in your writing says something about you," says Ms. Dresbold, who is known for her work with Pittsburgh and other local, state and federal law enforcement agencies and her book "Sex, Lies and Handwriting," which includes her analysis of handwriting in the JonBenet Ramsey, Lizzie Borden and Jack the Ripper cases, among others. Using a large projection screen, she points to similarities between the Zodiac Killer's handwriting and that of the California man — dots above "i's" that aren't filled in and squeezed "o's"; odd spacing and "d's" leaning to the right; similar "p's" and weirdly shaped "g's"; misspellings and "t's" curved at the bottom. "There are a lot of things that are pretty unusual," she told the group. "I was kind of shocked. I was not expecting this. "Do we have an exact match? No. But I really wonder why so many things are similar. I think there's too much to not take it seriously," says Ms. Dresbold, who said she needs more of the father's samples to conduct a complete analysis. Mr. Freeman said in an interview that he plans to contact a California police laboratory "and share what information we have and to see if there is anything they want us to do and anything they'll do." He was surprised to learn while researching the case that thousands of people had said over more than four decades that they know the Zodiac Killer's identity. "I was thinking, 'Is this one of those thousands?' and then Michelle comes up with this information. We're compelled to move forward and try to get DNA. It's high on our agenda (this) semester." Club president Alexandra Morgan, 20, a sophomore from Mechanicsburg, Cumberland County, agreed; "We definitely have a lot of work (this) semester, so I'm looking forward to it." The Zodiac Killer's case came to the club because a Downtown woman had been looking for a handwriting expert and found Ms. Dresbold. The woman told her this tale: She and her boyfriend last year had visited her father in northern California, where he also had lived at the time of the Zodiac killings. One night, he disappeared for six hours, returning in the early morning hours. Carrying a whiskey bottle, he woke the couple and oddly began quizzing them on what they knew about serial killers and asked them to name one that had never been caught. His demeanor was so strange, so dark, so off, his daughter thought. Chillingly, she learned there had been a murder during the time her father was out. The woman began investigating unsolved serial killings in the area and came upon the Zodiac Killer case. Fearing her father was the serial killer, she gave Ms. Dresbold a 2015 Christmas card with her father's handwriting for comparison. Ms. Dresbold gets similar requests about 10 times a year from people who mistakenly think a relative is a killer and want her to profile their writing. But this was different. "The punctuation, spacing, strange letter formation, the angles — I was pretty taken aback by (the comparison)," she said in an interview. "I really think the authorities should follow up on this man." HOW THE CLUB EVOLVED While investigating such a sensational case is exciting, the club has its roots in empathy. In the summer of 2015, Pitt student Nicole Coons of Harrisburg saw an attendant at a tennis club putting up a missing person poster for Kortne Stouffer, who was 21 when she vanished three years earlier. Ms. Coons, who plans to go to law school when she graduates this year, talked to the attendant who was a childhood friend of Ms. Stouffer. Moved by the baffling disappearance of someone near her age, she began researching the case and struck upon the idea of creating a cold case club in which "a lot of students look at it to try to catch something police officers might have missed." Ms. Coons, 21, presented her idea to her friend and fellow Pitt student Hannah Eisenhart, 22, likewise a senior from Harrisburg, and they set about the process of getting the club recognized. They needed a professor to be the sponsor so Ms. Coons, who as a sophomore had taken a class taught by Mr. Freeman, approached him about the possibility. "I would always talk to him after class and he was so interesting, telling stories about being a homicide detective. I could tell he was really good at his job and was a good and nice professor so I knew he would do a good job." A board was set up as were requirements for participants — students must have a 3.5 grade-point average, relevant internships and do well in an interview with board members. As president, Ms. Coons planned each two-hour weekly session for the club's meeting. Depending upon what is discussed, members often have work to do outside of the meeting and report back to the group of about 30 the following week. The first case they undertook was Ms. Stouffer's mysterious disappearance. With money provided by the university, they purchased a conference call speaker and conducted interviews during club meetings with Ms. Stouffer's family and friends. Social media was a key to locating some of Ms. Stouffer's friends who hadn't been interviewed by police and were willing to do so. Their names were provided to investigators. Ms. Coons and Ms. Eisenhart, who was the club's business manager, stepped down from their positions this school year so others could take their positions. "We didn't want to graduate and have things fall apart. We wanted it to continue on." HOPE FOR VICTIMS' FAMILIES In September, Dan Coyle of Freeport received a call from the club asking if he would be open to an interview about the death of his mother Stephanie, 74, in Arnold, Westmoreland County, on July 16, 1993. "We were just thrilled they were looking over the case," he said recently. "Twenty-three years have gone by and new people were interested. We were very excited." He and his wife, Barbara, came to a meeting in November and for nearly two hours talked about the case and answered the students' questions. "They all seemed so generally interested," he recalled. "This is great to have this many people show an interest in the case. "It's hard to put into words what this means to us. They are very, very intelligent and concerned." Mr. Freeman said that is the hallmark of the group of high-achievers. "It's just nice to see young people who want to give something back to our society that they're not getting paid for. They give hope to victims' families. "Given their enthusiasm and their abilities, I think some day we will (solve a case)," Mr. Freeman said. "You just never know what we'll find. Given their energy and efforts, anything is possible." ___ Online: http://bit.ly/2jlt96T Latest from the SFGATE homepage: Click below for the top news from around the Bay Area and beyond.

X Fitness trackers: the good, the bad and the ugly of wearable tech When it comes to our health, more knowledge may not always be a good thing Sat, Jan 14, 2017, 06:01 Jennifer O'Connell More and more people are using smart watches and health apps to monitor their lifestyle. Photograph: Getty Images         My heart soared when Ireland beat the All-Blacks in rugby in November this year. I don’t just mean that metaphorically – I have the data to prove it. At 10pm on November 5th, as the Ireland versus New Zealand rugby game entered its final moments, my heart was beating a healthy 66 times per minute. At 10.06pm, as the full-time whistle blew in Chicago, in my sitting room some 5,800 km away, my heartbeat leapt to 121 times per minute. One minute later, it had dropped back to 88. I know all this because I am the owner of an Apple Watch. Apple launched its first smartwatch 18 months ago, and already it has become the second highest revenue generating watch in the world, after Rolex. Despite reports of disappointing sales, around 12 million Apple watches are thought to be in circulation worldwide. One of them has spent the past 12 months on my left wrist, where it has taken up residence as a kind of portable personal assistant-slash-nanny-slash-Star Trek-style phone. It is a notifications centre and a nifty, car-safe GPS device. I can take calls on it when I’m driving, without taking my eyes off the road or my hands off the steering wheel – invariably prompting me to shout: “Look, kids, it’s the future!” It is a pedometer and a health monitor, nagging me by way of regular, soft vibrations on my wrist to drink water, to stand, to meditate, and to meet my daily calorie and exercise target (170 calories and 30 minutes of daily brisk exercise). But most of all, it is a shockingly comprehensive health database. Over the past year, while I’ve been going about my business, my watch has quietly been recording details of my steps, my calorific output, my sleep cycles – and all of the moments of heartbreak and happiness. At a glance, should I feel the need, I can find out how many steps I took in the month of April, or my heartrate at, say, 7.36pm on March 13th. It could also record my body temperature, my respiratory rate, my reproductive health, my UV exposure, my willingness to be an organ donor and even my sexual activity. ADVERTISEMENT Currently, one in 10 people in the US owns a health tracker such as a Fitbit or an Apple Watch. According to Google’s 2016 Connected Consumer Survey, 5 per cent of Irish people have a wearable device. Valuable data Over the next decade, adoption of these devices will become far more widespread, alongside sensors and apps that can monitor your body for signs of the onset of illness and chronic stress. We may not even need to remember to charge and wear a watch: smart pills are being developed that when swallowed will measure your health from inside your body, transmitting it to the cloud. Contact lenses will monitor us for signs of diabetes. Future generations of Apple Watches, Fitbits, or Android Wear gadgets will detect and mitigate “adverse health events,” such as addiction relapse, according to a recent report published by the MIT Technology Review. The reason tech companies are pouring so much money into this is not – whatever they might claim – that they are on a mission to save lives, or even to ensure we get our 10,000 steps a day (an entirely arbitrary number, by the way). It’s the data, stupid. Our health data is an increasingly valuable commodity, and – chillingly – a recent report by the Center for Digital Democracy and American University warned that there are almost “no privacy safeguards in place for consumer health data”, with multiple industries are ready and willing to mine it for profit. Irish users are protected by the more rigorous data protection environment in Europe. According to Rob Corbet of Arthur Cox, writing in a report from November 2015, there is no firm consensus between Europe and the US “on how to apply privacy rules in a manner that strikes the right balance between encouraging product innovation and protecting user security and privacy” as wearable and Internet of Things technologies evolve. Users in Europe may be asked to specifically consent to the storage of their data – in much the same way as we have to consent to allow cookies to record our movements online. In December, Apple began asking Watch users to opt into anonymous data collection about workouts and activity information. Internationally, a number of employers and insurers have seized on wearable tech and health apps as a way to encourage healthy choices by workers and – the theory goes – cut down on sick days and insurance costs. In the UK, insurance companies are offering cut-price Apple Watches to customers who sign up to a data monitoring program. There are studies to suggest that when it comes to our health, more knowledge may not always be a good thing. An article in the British Medical Journal questioned whether the proliferation of health apps now on the market is, in fact, responsible for an increase in patient stress levels. Wearing a smart watch has certainly made me a bit more hypochondriac: before this year, I don’t think I had ever used the phrase “resting heart rate”. Consultant dietitian Paula Mee, who no longer wears a fitness tracker, says that when she began monitoring her activity with a Jawbone, she found that she was only managing 2,000 to 3,000 steps a day – a finding that was “more dispiriting than motivating”. “Anything that helps people to move is useful, but I do think we could improve it and help people to use the data in a more meaningful way, to set personal goals for themselves. You might only burn off 200 or 300 carlories, but your muscle mass is developing and your visceral fat is decreasing. so part of the challenge is helping people to understand the benefits of exercise, even when the numbers being recorded on their tracker seem low.” ADVERTISEMENT Dr Deirdre Plant, a Waterford-based GP, agrees that more awareness “can only be a positive thing. Obesity is a huge issue for our generation. For the few people who might obsess about it, this technology will be worth it if it stops many more of us being in denial,” she says. “We’ll say we walk three times a week, but we’ll forget that this week we didn’t actually manage to walk once. So a fitness tracker, used properly, can be a good tool.” So has my year of quantified health made me any, well, healthier? The short answer: probably. Looking over my data, I can see that my exercise level increased over the course of the year, from a daily average of a paltry 16 minutes of brisk exercise in the first six months, up to around 24 minutes in the second half. But that may be more to do with a shift in my lifestyle than a conscious choice: halfway through the year, I moved from car-reliant California home to rural Ireland. When the vibrations nudge me to have a glass of water or to stand for one minute, I will often obey. And in return for for the small amount of additional worrying I do about my lack of restful sleep – or whether the repository of data I’m unconsciously gathering in my phone’s health app will one day come back to haunt me – I glean a deep, visceral pleasure from seeing my calorie and activity circles complete, or when I set my watch to time a bike ride or a hike. Unfortunately, the one thing it hasn’t managed to improve is my reprehensible time keeping. That may be beyond even a smartwatch. 10 of the best fitness trackers Apple Watch 2: The Apple Watch Series 2 – a waterproof version – is now available. €349; apple.com/ie Fitbit Blaze: Full activity tracker and heart rate monitor which offers call, text and calendar notifications and on-screen workouts.

According to Ian Fogg, director at market research firm IHS, Apple creates so good products that it always competes with its previously launched products. “They set their own stands. But, there has been no Apple product with greater impact than the iPhone, for Apple, for the mobile industry, and because of the spread of mobile technology, for the whole technology industry,” Fogg said. The original iPhone included multiple innovations including a direct manipulation multi-touch interface and desktop PC class web browser and other built in apps such as Google Maps, Apple Mail, and calendar and contacts. This caused every other mobile handset maker to alter their products. Apple also innovated quickly, using an annual update cycle to the iPhone hardware and software to outpace many rivals, Fogg said. In the ten years since the iPhone’s announcement there are numerous changes directly or indirectly caused by the iPhone, Fogg claims and here are just a few of the important one: 1)The leading handset makers of 2007 – number one Nokia among them – have been replaced by Apple, Samsung and Huawei. 2) The leading smartphone operating systems of 2007 are no longer with us, including Symbian, BlackBerry, Palm, and Windows CE. Read: Apple might launch three new iPads in March this year 3)The smartphone has moved from a product with niche adoption to one which everyone owns. 4) Multi-touch interfaces have become mainstream, not only on smartphones, but on PCs and tablets as well. 5) Apps have become mainstream, replacing websites for many uses, because of Apple’s success of creating an easy profitable way to distribute apps; and, other companies have used the same model, including the Google Play store and Microsoft’s Windows PC app store. Read: As Apple’s iPhone turns 10 today, Cook says just getting started 6) The smartphone has become the hub for consumers’ digital lives, replacing the PC. In 2007, every hardware product connected to the PC, now everything connects to smartphones. 7) Technologies pioneered in smartphones have enabled the creation of new products, from tablets, to smartwatches, fitness trackers and TV streaming boxes such as Apple TV. Companies making mobile hardware and software such as ARM, Facebook and Google, have prospered, at the expense of competitors who have failed to succeed in mobile such as Intel and Microsoft. 9) The aspirational business model for technology companies has changed from licensing an operating system and allowing others to build hardware – like the classic PC business model – has been replaced with efforts to replicate Apple’s tight integration of hardware and software.

By Sreeraman Thiagarajan At the end of 14th century, Unicorn was a common theme in medieval and renaissance works of art and literature. The ‘Hunt for the Unicorn’ a series of seven tapestries displays hunters and noblemen in pursuit of the legendary unicorn. Who knew the hunt would resurface again in this century? Only this time, Unicorns are startups with a billion dollar valuation, the hunters are replaced by venture capitalists, noblemen by tech entrepreneurs and tapestry with news media which doles out tonnes of high octane startup stories of gluttony, contentment and fiascos. Indian startup ecosystem from 2014 through 2016 was a near emulation of the California Gold Rush – some found gold and made a fortune (entrepreneurs & employees), some made rich by selling shovels (vendors & partners), and a lot of unlucky ones died trying (VCs who burnt a lot of money). We are at a pivotal point. Some of the hottest startups with north of 30 million have fallen by the way side just under 24 months since inception. VCs are hibernating in the ‘funding winter’ caused by absence of any big bang returns they promised their principals. Is this it? Grab some popcorn, for this is a long story about how fundamentals of business strategy has remained unchanged over time and constantly proves why Having & retaining competitive advantage (CA) is more crucial than speed of growth. Value (V) creation over valuation. Why execution (E) matters more than ideas. Let’s call it as CAVE principles. Trajectory of the ' J curve' All along human history, every era has a radical tent pole business that made a few people rich, powerful and famous. Along the way it would create a revolution, challenge the status quo, overturn conventions of that time period and bestow the accrued benefits to an entire civilization or people of a region. The kings built temples and monuments, sailors explored new trade routes and discovered islands, industrialists built factories that can manufacture pots & pans to aeroplanes, corporates built public limited companies, and today, tech entrepreneurs are building startups. What’s interesting about the evolution of such tent pole business is how did they reached top of a curve and then how did they stay there for long? This is similar to the J curve VCs expect their portfolio companies to chase. Historically, era appropriate ventures that follow the CAVE principles seem to have hit J curve. The Kailash temple in Ellora, Maharashtra tells us a great deal about executing a great idea with even greater perseverance. Built during the 8th century, it took over 135 years and spanned four generations of Rashtrakutas kings who built it without questioning the original idea. It was not built stone-by-stone but rather a mountain was carved out to make a temple with layers of sanctums and shrines. Archaeologists are unsuccessful in concluding how or what technologies were used to create this unique rock-cut structure in the world. Something similar happens in tech industry where a patent or unique algorithm gives the competitive edge to a business model built on top of it. While the competition struggles to emulate the same, the first mover raises to a monopoly. Similar to how the rock cutting techniques gave Kailash temple the competitive advantage, consider Google’s PageRank, Tesla car’s batteries or Facebook’s EdgeRank, this is what make them unique at a kernel level. Technology to the rescue Having a unique technology that can be used to solve problems at scale gives you an edge, and these companies have built their business models on such technologies which is raking in billions of dollars in revenue. Compare this to the copycat businesses spun off by Rocket Internet which eventually has to sell Jabong and FabFurnish in a fire sale. Many stories have been written on how the fear of missing out (FOMO) factor has given rise to VCs writing cheques to copycat startups who have no novel technology but only a business model. At one point it was really easy to explain a business to a prospective investor, all that to be said was, we are an Uber-for-X or an Amazon-for-Y. Since customers were renting movies to maids online on an on-demand basis, gig economy & marketplaces did seem attractive garnering millions in funding. But is the market ready? Are customers willing to pay? Can competition emulate your offer better than you do? Who has time to do due diligence when the Gold Rush is on and the neighbour is raking all the perceived benefits? Crash and burn? The last six months alone has been agonising, Peppertap, Doormint, TinyOwl wound up. Zomato and Grofers downsized their operations. Flipkart’s valuation was repeatedly slashed. SoftBank wrote down &550 million, their investments in Ola & Snapdeal. And we all survived to see a grand epilogue - Housing.com merging for all stock deal which ends the biggest drama of the decade. Having original technology are inevitable to qualify as a tech startup. In the true spirit of building tech products, only the proprietary or patentable technology can elevate the business to near monopoly, not advertising and heavy discount. Businesses that enjoy monopoly status are hard to replicate and seldom die easy. In case of Kailash temple, let alone anyone recreating the rock-cut structures, it could not even be destroyed when Mughal king Aurangzeb ordered one thousand men to destroy the temple. After many months of futile attempt, his men could only scratch the surface and disfigure a few sculptures. Consider this statement from Navneet Singh, co-founder of PepperTap who wrote on YourStory “Our customers were, at times, unable to see the entire selection of items from a store and sometimes even essential items were missing from the catalogue visible to them”. In other words, a grocery app which had no technology to show the groceries available to a customer who is looking to buy them at the first place. PepperTap did not just lack having a competitive advantage, they sucked at having what it takes to be in tech business. The lesson here is the first principle of CAVE - build competitive advantage through technology, work on business models that can elevate to a monopoly. Going back, looking ahead In more modern times, stories from the house of Tata tells us a lot about the CAVE principles in play. The foundation stone of arguably India’s most valuable and reputed company was laid by a 29 year old Jamsetji Tata in 1868. His philosophy was, Industrialization can leads to India’s economic development. A century and half later Tata has grown from strength to strength like a banyan tree. It has survived colonial British rule, two world wars, liberalization of licence raj in 90s, a terrorist attack on its property, and the global economy crisis of 2008 and yet it stands tall. While its wide diversifications from salt to software has created wealth and value for all stakeholders, Tata’s contribution to nation building is profound as it pioneered and paved way for nuclear, aviation, and telecommunication industries to take off in India. Unlike Jamsetji, today’s 29 year olds seem to follow a different wisdom “Move fast and break things. Unless you are breaking stuff, you are not moving fast enough." Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg said this few years ago and many tech entrepreneurs seem to have taken this quite literally. Moving fast is a war cry, an intonation to motivate and not a business goal by itself. The actual lesson they must be learning is how Zuckerberg started Facebook to connect a small group of people at Harvard, tasted success, improved it, grew it ‘slowly’, resisted multiple buyout attempts, and eventually scaled it to connect a billion and half people today while creating value to investors and stakeholders. This nugget from on-demand laundry service startup Doormint’s last email before shutting down explains the myopia faced by some startup founders and the impulsive rate at which inflated valuation figures investors fantasise. “The costs of processing clothes, pick up and drop logistics and packaging made it difficult to recover through prices”. Ask any dhobi (laundry guy) from one pin code next to where you live to service you at doorstep and he’ll tell you why he’s not interested; if you persist he may even explain why it’s not feasible. But for Doormint’s VCs it just cost three million dollars to learn this. The ecosystem must let go the prevailing opinion that every business is ripe for disruption. Worst, if it worked elsewhere, we can make it work in India. All it takes is bunch of hoodie wielding developers who can code, investors who can write cheques to keep the lights on, and hang around in the startup ecosystem to give and take advice. The outcome of this move fast - break things are founders’ hubris, hibernating investors, erosion of confidence among white and blue collars alike to join startups, rupturing the market and making consumers sceptics. We can’t solve startup problems with startup solutions, we need a business centric approach. A quick look at Fortune 500 companies in India reveals the top rank is for Indian Oil, a PSU. Also notable is that 200 out of 500 companies are family owned, out of which 32 were setup before 1947. TVS, Birla, Mahindra, Escorts are some of the companies who have been doing many thing well for a really long period time leading to every concerned person deriving value. A quintessential fit in CAVE principles. But guess what, familiarity breeds contempt and the last place a 21 year old IIT dude wants to take inspiration to build a startup does not happen to be his parent’s employer. Am I wrong about this?

Just a few years ago there was a plethora of stores to choose from. Now there is just one. With The Tone Station, formerly Hartnoll Guitars, on Mutley Plain shutting its doors for good last week, and Kerry's Music on Ebrington Street currently in its final days of trading, the future looks bleak. But Plymouth is not the only city independent shops are being killed off by corporate giants. "It's the same throughout the country," said Rich Turner, who owns Sound Unlimited on Embankment Road. "It's a difficult time." Rich said once popular independent instrument shops are being crushed by online retailers and "faceless" instrument megastores. "Above anything we are about the people," explained Rich, who runs the business with his dad, John. "We focus on the musicians themselves, and selling good equipment. "The saddest thing I see is youngsters being sold guitars which are not playable, even by a good guitarist. "We don't sell cheap things, but anything we do sell has to be playable and a good instrument. These youngsters think that's what instruments are, when they're not." With Kerry Allen of Kerry's Music announcing she is taking early retirement, Sound Unlimited will be bringing in more stock to "cover the gap". This includes more ukuleles, violins, and music books. Read next: How one city street is becoming the 'cultural quarter' of Plymouth Ms Allen, who is closing Kerry's Music for personal reasons, said the store will officially cease trading on January 21. On a Facebook post announcing the closure, she has thanked her "loyal" customer base over the years. At the same time, Jamie Hartnoll, owner of The Tone Station, has also announced its closure. The Tone Station, formerly Hartnoll's Guitar Centre, had an onsite guitar workshop and was also an official Gibson dealer. But Jamie says the industry is "struggling to support" retail shops up and down the country. "I know several other shops have closed this week and countless in recent years," said the music enthusiast. But it's not just the internet that is to blame, he was quick to add. "I have seen many retailers close their doors and immediately point the finger at the internet," he said, "or manufacturers, or customers, or the favourite – the Government. "This is unfair and rather arrogant as it is accepting no blame yourself. Every person in business has a duty to recognise and adapt to changing marketplaces. I've been doing that actively this year, a distinct and explicit move to reduce reliance on retail and increase the workshop services we offer and it's been working well. "Unfortunately, our mistake was made a few years back in expanding. The expansion added to costs but did not proportionally add to sales; the knock-on effect has been something I have been fighting for some time and unfortunately, the changes I've made this year have been too late. Read next: Inside the old Plymouth cinema brought back to life as a trendy coffee shop "Maintaining a skeleton retail operation is not viable, mainly due to stock commitments required by the major brands." Market research recently published by IBIS states the musical instrument retailers industry endured "tough conditions" from 2011 – 2016. It says "subdued" economic performance during this time resulted in "uncertainty" among consumers, who subsequently reduced their expenditure on discretionary goods. "This change in consumer behaviour affected a number of retail industries," it continues, "and further aggravated the decline in the musical instrument retailers industry, which was already underperforming." Adding to this, the number of young children learning traditional musical instruments at school has been in decline for more than a decade. A recent study by ABRSM, the exam board of the Royal Schools of Music, said long-term music education is often still the preserve of the rich, with the cost of learning to play and taking lessons a "major barrier". Rich, at Sound Unlimited, said it is "critical" to work alongside schools, colleges and studios to revert this trend. But he said people, especially in poorer parts of the UK, just "don't have the money" to spend on instruments – let alone learning to play them. Jamie, who opened his Mutley Plain shop in 2006, added modern-day customers expect "instant gratification" at "low cost". He said: "No retailer, however large, can provide the availability that 'the internet collective' can. "A kid can sit at home on their iPad and do a Google search for whatever product they like. They won't care where it comes from, just that it arrives tomorrow and it's cheap. We all understand that mentality. "But what if the item they've decided to buy doesn't best fit their needs? Who do they go to discuss this with and is this purchase really the best value? "With the distance selling regulations currently in place, this kid can order several items, try them all at home and then return what's not needed, paying just a little more for return postage. Would it not be better, more sociable, more informative, and more productive for society as a whole if they were to visit a shop and talk to trained experts about the items, maybe have to wait 36 hours for delivery, but then get the best item for their needs first go?" Online musical instrument retailer Gear4music reported record sales during the lead up to Christmas 2016. Read next: Plymouth's lost cinemas: Where were they and why have they gone? The retailer saw £24.38 million in total sales during the four months to December 31 – a 55 per cent increase compared to the same period in 2015. Rich said for him, the "culprit" is not local people, but the force of corporate giants, such as Amazon and Google. He said: "We don't just ship boxes; that's not who we are – and it's not what any shop that has closed were either. "We had a customer the other day, who was a professional musician gigging five times a week, who came in at 5.40pm and had a gig starting at 6.30pm. "One of his instruments was broken, and he couldn't play without it, so we fired up the soldering iron and fixed the problem. You can't buy that online. "We are about focusing on the musicians themselves. Above anything we are about the people." P D Music on Ebrington Street closed in 2012, and Vibes Music on Mayflower Street ceased trading in 2015. Simon Young, owner of Vibes Music, took Individual Voluntary Arrangement (IVA) to avoid bankruptcy. More than 500 items from the shop, which first opened its doors in 1996, were put up for auction on BidSpotter.co.uk by the ES Group Ltd, part of Lambert Smith Hampton. Jamie, originally from Barnstaple, thinks people simply need to start shopping on the high street to prevent situations like this. He said: "Consider the knock-on effect that your small actions, when multiplied by all the people, can make and support your local shops. "Plymouth is now left with just one music store: Rich Turner Sound Unlimited. Go down there and support him. Buy everything you can from him including your strings, plectrums, and leads, that you might think are 'easier to get online'. He will give you the advice and care that no one online will. "He will pay business rates, which will support the local economy, and he will provide you with the best overall service that you can get. Give him first chance on products you want but you don't see in his shop. He might supply anyway – you might have to wait a day or two, but, it'll be worth it." Plymouth's closing music shops: My view I am writing this as a journalist and a musician. I love my job, and I have to admit, in the past two years it has overtaken my music playing. I only played three gigs last year and I am so busy with work and exams, I doubt I'll line any up any time soon. That being said, it came as a huge shock when I found out Kerry's Music and The Tone Station were closing. I've recently picked up the clarinet again (I learnt in school but that's as far as it ever got), and just last week I was thinking I needed to buy some new guitar strings and dust off my acoustic. But it never crossed my mind there would only be one shop to get them from. I've never been one for buying online. Even for something as small as guitar strings, there's something special about going into a music shop, picking them off the shelf and paying for them over the counter. Growing up in Bristol I remember going into my local music shop with my friends, be it to play their completely-out-of-my-price-range grand piano, wonder at their newest guitars or mess about on their electric drum kits. That shop is now closed. I agree with Jamie. Go out and support Plymouth's last independent music instrument shop. Or face living in a city without one at all.

The three founders noted only they've "been cranking on some new productivity tools" and were "hyped to announce" they'd continue their work at Quip. About Unity&Variety Flynn, Hamlin and Chung were at Facebook during Quip CEO Bret Taylor's three-year tenure as chief technology officer, from 2009 to 2012. Unity&Variety's one publicly released app is an iOS game called Pinchworm.  Joey Flynn's Facebook page The game's premise: "The love of your life has been snatched up by an evil bird! Jump, dig and inch your way back to get revenge and save your love!" Benioff Backs Taylor We're not sure how the game would fit into workplace productivity, but if you ask Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff, Quip's Taylor knows what he's doing. "He's one of the absolute rising stars of our industry," Benioff told Business Insider in August after Salesforce's acquisition was announced. "It's been my dream to work more closely with Bret Taylor." Taylor gave a hint of Quip's plans with a Tweet today: The incredible design team at Unity&Variety is joining @Quip to help build the next generation of productivity tools https://t.co/pNNEXOf1oC — Bret Taylor (@btaylor) January 13, 2017 Taylor was co-creator of Google Maps and is responsible for the “like” button. He founded Quip with Kevin Gibbs, who led engineering and product at Google, and brought Google App Engine to market. He heads up engineering at Quip. Quip's Salesforce Play Quip's productivity platform is designed for teams, combining communication and content to enable collaboration within documents or spreadsheets, on phones, tablets, wearables and the desktop.  Taylor's vision is to make Quip work across all Salesforce clouds and transform it to an all-in-one hub for "living documents" that seamlessly merge documents, spreadsheets, task lists and team chat. Salesforce officials said by mid-2017, they will be able to embed live customer relationship data into their documents and associate their work with a Salesforce record.  Taylor at last year's Dreamforce emphasized how a team could avoid a deluge of email and focus on using Quip for a more centralized workflow. The acquisition comes in the same week enterprise collaboration experts predicted a hot 2017 for consolidation in the digital workplace space. Enterprise collaboration provider Atlassian acquired task management vendor Trello this week in a deal valued at $425 million. 0 Comments Top Articles Related Articles Recent Comments OpenText's Loss, RSA's Gain: Rohit Ghai Leaves Dell EMC ECD 12 Ways AI Has or Will Change Content Management Atlassian to Acquire Trello in $425M Enterprise Collaboration Deal Why Customer Data Platforms Are Gaining Traction What's the Next Step in the Evolution of AI?

Young mothers have become a powerful consumer group. | Barbara Duckworth photo Consumer perceptions and confusion abound when it comes to the topic of genetically modified organisms. There was no confusion for Jennifer Carlson when she launched her line of organic baby food 11 years ago. “Organic was always predominately the number one choice when we started this company,” the Calgary mother said. “As a mother, I wanted to give my baby the very best, and that came with the best of ingredients.” Carlson did not want anything containing pesticides, antibiotics, growth hormones or GMOs when she started making baby food in her kitchen for her six-month-old daughter. Certified organic products cannot be genetically modified, but that information is not added to the food label. Related stories in this issue: Farm groups challenge food company’s non-GM pledge Grappling with GM animals Farmers have much to teach consumers Case made for labelling, but questions abound Public’s anti-GMO perception tainted by media, say Green Party, NFU Judge GM on a case-by-case basis: experts The debate over GM foods Farmers play important role in building consumer trust Consumers still opposed to GM food Divergence: If GM technology is safe, why don’t consumers trust it? To be on the safe side, she does not use corn starch or canola in any of her products, which she sells across North America under the brand name Baby Gourmet. The company website provides full information on ingredients, and Carlson is active on social media and blogs for the Huffington Post about good eating. “We are very transparent about where our food comes from and where our ingredients come from,” she said. “People like to read the ingredients. They like to see what is in it.” People are hungry for information, and Carlson has joined the newly formed Clean Label Project as an adviser. During her time in the food business, she has learned that mothers make up an influential consumer group who get their information from each other and social media. They want to know more, but how they sift through the billions of bytes of data is up to them. “You have to find a reliable source that you trust and follow their information,” said Carlson. Finding that credible, trustworthy source of information can be a challenge, said Crystal MacKay, executive director of Farm and Food Care Canada. The organization oversees the Canadian Centre for Food Integrity, which works to build public trust in the food supply. Research is showing many people are not scientifically literate, and when they consult Google, negative information about genetic modification is often the first thing they see, she said. Surveys from across North America report that people want their food labelled for the presence of GMOs, but when pressed, the average person is not sure what the term means. Some members of focus groups have said breeding the best cow to the best bull to get a better animal is genetic modification, even though farmers have done selective breeding since livestock was domesticated. “People aren’t willing to work that hard to understand complex things like GMOs,” MacKay said. “It is easier to be against something than try and sort through all that noise to figure out what the answer is.” ADVERTISMENT Finding credible information can be a problem, and researchers study sources of information regularly. Recent research on public trust found people believe that university and government researchers are the most credible sources of information. Dieticians and veterinarians are also trusted sources, while corporations are not. “The closer you are to the profit, the less credible you will be viewed,” she said. However farmers have a high level of credibility, even though they make money growing GM crops. Comprehension is part of the problem. Scientists and reports may have credibility, but reading peer reviewed research papers may not tell the average consumer what she wants to know. Farm and Food Care has introduced the Best Food Facts Online to its website. It is a U.S. based resource with 120,000 visitors per month. Ten Canadian researchers have been added to the group of experts to provide an online forum to answer questions. “The goal is to provide a foodie friendly forum for researchers to have the opportunity to express their views, not in a scientific journal way,” MacKay said. “The most important thing for Canadians is healthy and affordable food, and after that they want to know they have access to the information,” she said. Ellen Goddard, professor and co-operative chair of agricultural marketing and business at the University of Alberta, studies consumers, their attitudes and perceptions. Biotechnology and GMO opinions have been on her radar for a long time. “I wouldn’t say the entire population was positive about the idea. It is important to get that,” she said. One of her research projects asked subjects if they would eat something like margarine if they knew it contained a GMO. More than half said they would not buy it, even though most canola has been modified. “It begs the question what would happen if we labelled it,” she said. “This is the reason why some people are so opposed to labelling it because of that relatively high percentage that is in the definitely not/probably not category.” Her surveys have found nearly half the population is opposed or somewhat opposed to biotechnology in general, but 55 percent support it. Medicinal use of biotechnology was received less negatively. “It is not the technology, but the technology in food, that somehow makes them uncertain.” Those who are strongly opposed do not change their minds, al-though the numbers in the neutral category are growing a bit. “In the last 15 years, we are not seeing a switch in people being negative about technology to people being positive about this. It seems to be staying relatively flat,” she said. There are geographical differences of opinion. “Having some connection to agriculture seems to moderate your views,” she said. “You don’t need to be a farmer. If you lived in Airdrie, you are probably going to know more about agriculture than somebody who lives in downtown Calgary, just because of the people you hang around with.” Age is another influencer. ADVERTISMENT “Older people are a bit more philosophical about technology, so if they can see a health benefit, then they are happy enough with it,” she said. If they see no benefit, they are in the neutral category. Millennials may have the strongest preferences for natural products, so researchers are trying to pinpoint what people define as natural. “Natural could mean anything.” People younger than 35 are realizing they have to learn how to cook, and they want things with fewer ingredients. They also want to understand what the ingredients are and do not want products that sound like they were created in a lab. Goddard is also tracking where people get information. Her research team asked people at the end of 2015 which types of social media they use to get information about food, science or technology. Those results are still being analyzed. “The demand for information is something that is pervasive throughout my research, whether I am dealing with genetic technologies or genomic selection or anything,” she said. “If you ask the public, they will always say more information is better than less,” she said. Some researchers have asked people if they know what DNA, genomics or genetically modified organisms are, and have found there to be limited knowledge. They also asked people if they agree or disagree that the world is better off with technology. Those who agree are also fine with GM products. As well, people who are generally more positive about technology rate themselves as high knowledge when asked to self-assess their personal knowledge about science and technology. “Are those people more knowledgeable? Possibly,” Goddard said. “Is there a link to education? Possibly. Can we educate ourselves out of people’s concerns about this? No.” Children may be influenced to accept these technologies and understand what they are, but adults are not likely to change their minds. “Your beliefs are made up of so many different values that the education piece doesn’t work particularly, especially if it comes from an interest group,” she said. Goddard said she has found that people want more information, and some have said they are willing to pay more for products with more detailed labels. “We seem to have an insatiable demand for information from a variety of sources,” she said.

Harold Is it the white lab coat you’re looking at? Can you tell me then, how the “other” scientists with the same or higher levels of education and expert opinion are so readily debunked, all dependent upon the position of their expert opinion. Why above this, is there a expert opinion about expert opinion’s. Science supports Science period. Outside is technology. From outside, technology is being used to express science. This group is representing technology “so called” independently. Debunking is not a term within science. Simply, you cannot debunk the study methods of the moon, you can only debunk the method of getting there. Debunking the method of getting to the moon, does not make the moon disappear or their studies. Furthermore, the Challenger was not put into place to debunk the original rocket-ship. I see this connection in all of your arguments. I know when and who to listen to for science, and I know who and when to listen to technology. For this, i am neither a pro-this or anti-that for your pleasure. RobertWager I always find it interesting when the critics of GE technology attempt to smear high level reports on the safety of GE crops and derived foods but they never bring forward quality science that is accepted by the expert GE technology community (that is a global group of experts). There is very good data from decades of properly executed examination of GE crops and derived foods and it all confirms what the EASAC and repeated NAS reports say. GE crops and derived foods are as safe or safer than food derived from plants made with other breeding methods.. That is the bottom line. Harold Let’s take a look at your words. critic, smear, high level, quality, accepted, expert, very good, properly executed, and bottom line. Interesting in deed. When has science ever had, or enjoyed a bottom line? When you smear and criticize, it’s not the same, is it. When you act, you’re not an activist are you. When did the words activist, opposition, and critical, become bad words? Did somebody re-write the dictionary? Tell me this. Without ongoing human and animal epidemiological studies originating from 20 years ago, how do you prove the safety of food altered by technology. Even so, without labeling, how are long term effects traced to the origin? Apparently this is not considered to be part of a “properly executed examination”. It’s considered to be smear. Am I being anti-something? Some people have become more critical and therefore have developed a concern for which they act upon. They are not the anti- which is thrown around indiscriminately. RobertWager Having concerns is normal but unfortunately we live in the “post truth” era and there is so much false information about GE crops and derived foods that many people (with real fear) are concerned about things that are not true. Please tell this forum what unique risks food derived from GE crops have. richard Unique risk #1…..the use of glyphosate increasing exponentially since the advent of GMO….1.35 MILLION TONNES globally…. an insidious addiction to a monocultural worldview perpetrated by apocryphal spine numbing repetition… RobertWager And what herbicides did it replace and what was effect on the environment from the switch from older herbicides? May i suggest you look up this fact. I would be happy to link this information to you. richard ……the rote specious argument again……Its irrelevant sir, because they are obsolete also…… The real question is what are you going to do about group one, two, three, four, five and six herbicide resistance…..the direct result of forty years of monocultural, monothematic, monotonous agribiz doctrine hitting the brick wall… (13 weed species on sixty million acres in the USA resistant to glyphosate (USDA)…. and increasing every minute, of every hour of every day…… And you still think its about defending transgenic DNA? … RobertWager Hi Richard. Herbicide resistance in weeds is as old as herbicide use. Presently there are around 200 different weeds resistant to different herbicides and just over a dozen are resistant to glyphosate. Further if you look at the history of resistance development in weeds over the decades it has actually slowed after the invention of herbicide tolerant GE crops. I Now if you ask is there an environmental impact of GE crops the answer is definitely yes. But context is everything in this discussion. Has GE crops reduced the environmental impact of agriculture? Again the answer is definitely yes. There is no free lunch. All agriculture impacts the environment. the trick is to produce the maximum yield with the minimum impact in the most sustainable way. in that regard GE crops are part of the answer in the coming decades. Tomas Moravec glyphoaste use has increased exponentially in EU too, yet we do not grow any RuR crops. The major driver was the expirarion of patent protection. Fields here are sprayed before emergence and sometimes even before harvest, in the US mainly after the crop germinates. Harold Please answer the question that i have asked you over and over again. Perhaps this merry-go-round will cease. Is “real fear” the appropriate response to have when one faces accountability lacking? I just “hang up the phone”, or press the delete button. Is somebody holding a “real” gun? or Is this a “Let’s just say”? From who’s opinion, does it become the fact, of a “post truth” era? Is this another “let just say”? How over me, do you choose what my truth is going to be? Was it upon your birth? Did your power of observation; along with the ability to read and write, not bring you to where you are today? Who then is lacking in the sameness? The public? Me? You asked of the following: Q) “Please tell this forum what unique risks food derived from GE crops have”? A) The risk is: GE risks are not obvious, and not immediate, and not traceable, whereas, a poisonous mushroom is all three, plus an immediate victim< the expression of the poison. This makes GE unique. What separates GE from "tobacco science", is that the tobacco victim has full knowledge of the total amount of the smoking, and therefore, so do the studies with tobacco's long term effects. Tobacco and contents are pinpointed in a human study, that previously were not carried out or covered up. Some may foolishly believe that the ill effects could only be discovered by examining the plant, and the environment, and believing peer reviewed "tobacco Science", rendering a human body study needless. Where GE and "tobacco science" are the same, is that in essence, the victim has no useful knowledge of the "smoking", nor useful knowledge of the total amount of the "smoking", yet cannot discontinue "smoking" to pinpoint it's long/short term effects. This makes GE favorable and not unique to the eyes of health examination. This places GE from first, to last position, to "when all else fails", a multitude. in determining a cause for failing health. For the past 20 years, GE has held an ill-placed, last-place position. I do know why you are refusing, and side-stepping my question. The answer makes your question moot, and in turn, dissolves your related claims. Epidemiological animal and human studies representing 20 years; where are they?- Are epidemiological study's even possible?- If epidemiological study's are impossible,who has made it so?- What is a epidemiological study's purpose? What is a human epidemiological GE study's equivalent, and where is it's representation of 20 years?- How important are epidemiological study's? From one on one, you have invited the forum in, at your request, in a bid that i may bring discredit to myself, not to you, but to the eye of all. Now I shall do the same As a man of knowledge, can you concisely, for this forum, answer just one or more of these questions? RobertWager Biofortifiedgenera has the studies you seek. Jason What separates GE from “tobacco science”, is that the tobacco victim has full knowledge of the total amount of the smoking, and therefore, so do the studies with tobacco’s long term effects. You bring up a great comparison. Just like with tobacco, there was a large body of evidence and a scientific consensus on health impacts, yet financial motivations lead a group to deny that scientific consensus. Tomas Moravec …of food altered by technology.. the point there is, that most GM derived foods are not altered at all. How is sugar from GM sugar beet altered relative to cane sugar or beet sugar? The foods that have been altered are not on the market yet, or are vailabel in limited areas. Like arctic apples or simplot tomatoes, goldenrice. grinninglibber GLC is a GMO operative site. Peaceful Warrior Both the EASAC and the NAS have huge conflicts of interest with the biotech industry. The GLP is an industry controlled site full of industry spin, propaganda, and disinformation that igores any science that conflicts with it’s industry agenda.

Nestled in the English countryside are massive research and development centers, top secret labs and various toys that founder James Dyson collected over the years, including a helicopter in the parking lot and a jet plane in the cafeteria. It’s from this unlikely place that Dyson hopes to make a worldwide splash over the next year and change the way people think about the high-end vacuum maker.  An English Electric Lightning fighter jet hangs above the cafe at Dyson’s campus. Photographer: Simon Dawson/Bloomberg Ricardo Reyes Photographer: Michael Short/Bloomberg The person leading this charge is Ricardo Reyes, Dyson’s new communications chief. He made a name for himself in Silicon Valley as the top spokesman for Elon Musk’s Tesla Motors Inc. where he survived longer than most who have held that position. Reyes also worked at Google, YouTube and Square Inc. The appointment of Reyes is of note for a couple of reasons. Last year, Dyson launched the Supersonic, a hair dryer that took about four years and $70 million to develop. Like all Dyson products, the hair dryer was intensely engineered and costs a lot -- $400. It also marked a major expansion for Dyson past things like vacuums and air purifiers. Executives have promised more products as the company tries to become the Apple of home appliances. Reyes must solidify this idea in consumers’ minds, and has already honed his talking points. "Dyson is growing from the living room to the bathroom and beyond, so people are going to interact with it a lot more," Reyes said. "The typical consumer has no idea of the amount of innovation going on here." Dyson has also been rumored to be working on an electric car. Last year, the Financial Times turned up government documents that revealed funding to help Dyson on this project. Dyson bought battery startup Sakti3 for $90 million in 2015, and pledged last year to spend 1 billion pounds ($1.2 billion) on battery development over five years, putting it in closer competition with Tesla. Dyson campus Photographer: Simon Dawson/Bloomberg Dyson already has deep electric motor experience. Lab 61 at its headquarters is filled with electric motors of all sizes that have gone through more than a decade of research and sit at the heart of Dyson’s products. This includes the hair dryer, which runs on a miniaturized turbine. If you were looking to bring a new electric car to market, then Reyes would be a good choice, since he helped usher in Tesla’s Roadster, Model S and Model X vehicles. Asked about Dyson’s plans for an electric car, Reyes said, "You never know what Dyson has up its sleeve." For Reyes, Dyson was a good match with Tesla. "It’s very rare to find companies that combine software, hardware and manufacturing all together and to find a company like that that goes direct to the consumer," he said. At Tesla, Reyes was known for having Musk’s ear and being able to sway the inventor at times. But the relationship deteriorated as the years went on, and confrontations around product launches grew more heated.  Asked about the personality of James Dyson, Reyes said, "He moves very quickly, but, at the same time, he’s measured and thoughtful." The company’s brand is strongest in Europe and Japan. It hopes new products will make Dyson a more familiar name in the U.S. and other countries. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

The evaluation was based on a list of 167 Chinese brands, representing their brand awareness among overseas consumers, according to the report. The other top-10 Chinese brands are Elex Tech, Xiaomi, Air China, Haier, Anker, Cheetah Mobile and Hisense. Technology brands are able to improve consumers' lives by applying digital technology and creating ecosystems that combine e-commerce and mobile payment apps with other services.

Richard Lai, @richardlai 01.12.17 in Mobile Comments 346 Shares Share Tweet Share Save HTC President Chialin Chang holding a U Ultra at the launch event. HTC may have taken a bolder approach in the smartphone world with its new U Ultra and U Play, but it's decided to play it safe with its roadmap for the rest of the year. After today's launch event in Taipei, I caught up with President of Smartphone and Connected Devices Business, Chialin Chang, who confirmed that HTC will only be releasing six to seven smartphones this year. While that's a drastic cut from last year's eleven to twelve models, he claims this has so far allowed the company to focus on its smartphones' core features, in a bid to put up a better fight against other brands. In the case of the two newest phones, Chang sees machine learning as their main selling point. The exec described the so-called Sense Companion virtual assistant as a combination of Google's Awareness API, device information and third-party data. Over time, the device learns your commuting pattern, dining preferences and app usage habits, in order to offer useful tips at the right time. For instance, it will be able to tell whether you walk, drive or take public transportation to work, and will eventually offer relevant departure times; it will even throw in weather alerts before you leave home or work. While some of these assistant features are already available on Android in some shape or form, HTC's approach goes deeper than, say, Google Now. Besides, U Ultra users will get these notifications on the always-on second display just above the main screen. Better yet, your assistant profile data is stored in the cloud, meaning that when you switch to another HTC phone in the future, you don't have to retrain Sense Companion; simply log into your HTC account and your new device will be just as smart as your old one. Chang added that throughout 2017, HTC will be adding more Sense Companion features via updates, which should see the addition of more third-party services involving the likes of restaurants, malls and cab-hailing apps, in the hopes of making it more of an integral part of our lives. Or as the exec put it, "we're not trying to emphasize A.I.; we're trying to emphasize companionship." Admittedly, we won't know how well Sense Companion works until we've spent some quality time with the new phones, but the U Ultra alone -- set to ship in the US in March -- has a few more tricks up its sleeve. Its bundled USonic USB-C earphones can quickly scan your ear canals using sonic pulse, and then the phone automatically adjusts its audio output's frequency response to make up for weaker hearing at certain frequencies. This is more convenient than the manual tuning on the HTC 10 and the HTC 10 Evo (aka Bolt). The U Ultra also packs four always-on microphones for biometric voice recognition plus high-res 3D audio capture -- something that Chang believes is the future for mobile VR. Photography-wise, the U Ultra has the same awesome 12-megapixel UltraPixel main camera as the HTC 10, as well as a 16-megapixel front-facing camera which offers an UltraPixel mode for boosted sensitivity in dark environments. Not to mention that the device comes in a refreshingly gorgeous "liquid surface" design. "We hope consumers will really see value in this smartphone." For the remainder of the year, Chang told us to also expect a few Desire devices for the "fun and affordable" markets. When asked whether there will be an "HTC 11," the exec simply said it won't be named as such this year, so there's a good chance that HTC is still committed to a true flagship device for 2017 -- one which will hopefully take advantage of Qualcomm's upcoming Snapdragon 835 chipset.

The annual income from “the 10% vig,” oops, tax — estimated to be close to $1 trillion by the end of President Barack Obama’s second term — would nearly wipe out the current budget deficit. State and local casino and lottery operations would not affected by the new national legislation. Code named “You Bet Your Ass,” the concept was conceived in a late night drinking and strategy session in May when it seemed obvious to the president’s senior advisors that a second dip of the economy was all but inevitable. As the fifth fifth of Talisker scotch — the current beverage of choice in Washington — was passed around the table, the always mild-mannered chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel, slurred the battle cry of the forthcoming campaign: “I’ll give you 10:1 odds that we kick the shit out of those MF’s in 2012.” At that moment, Moshe Peddler, the senior partner of Peddler and Marconi Communications and the president’s outside media maven, felt he had been hit by a thunderbolt. Nevertheless, it took him all night to put the pieces together: that “10:1 odds” phrase, combined with a lifetime of peddling crap, meant federal control and the “taxing” of online gambling. A quick Google search revealed that it was already legal in some major European countries. Internet gambling was coming. The only question was who would control it: the casino operators or Uncle Sam? Today, the Democrats had control of Congress and maybe they could ram it through. After the elections, who knew? Using $200,000 of his company’s political slush funds, Peddler went right to work: grassroots call-ins the next morning to 2,500 radio stations, followed up by in-depth research. That evening, 3,547 land line and cell phone surveys were conducted on two key issues: First, 73% wanted internet gambling; and, second, the public didn’t give a damn who controlled it, as long as they got to play an honest game of Texas Hold? Em. The next morning, Moshe, Rahm and the President sat down for a super secret meeting. Everyone else was banished. Even the secret recording system was shut down. In five minutes, Moshe presented his plan, his research, the preliminary numbers from the budget office and his findings. The chief of staff was so happy he danced on nine fingers. Maybe he would stay the full term after all. The president was another story. Obviously, he’d piss off the religious right and the casino owners. But they were leaning GOP anyway. If Peddler’s numbers were right, he’d come close to wiping out the budget deficit. He figured that plus health care might make him the fifth face on Mt. Rushmore. Peddler read his boss’ face. He was the best closer on the planet, and went in for the kill like Tyson in his prime. “Mr. President, did you know that England and France have already legalized Internet gambling? Denmark has finished its legislation and Germany, Switzerland and Spain are goose-stepping to be next in line. We either try to regulate and tax it, or people are going to go to the offshore operators, where you don’t get any revenue.” The president was sold. “Rahm,” said the now beaming Obama, “alert all the cable and networks for a major address for Sunday at nine. And make sure those budget numbers are right. “Finally, we need a slogan. Something like: Game On.” Bill Regardie was the founder and publisher of Regardie’s Magazine.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Saturday, 14 January 2017 | MYT 9:00 AM HTC puts AI at the heart of new U-series smartphones Feature-packed: The HTC U stands out from competitors thanks to a second screen to the top right of the phone's main display and an AI-enabled voice assistant called Sense Companion. — HTC Taiwanese manufacturer HTC has unveiled two inaugural models for its new U series of smartphones. The 5.2in and 5.7in handsets both come with an AI-enabled voice assistant called Sense Companion, enhancing user experiences with contextual suggestions and recommendations.  The HTC U Ultra is the brand's new top-of-the-range 5.7in smartphone. It stands out from competitors thanks to a second screen to the top right of the phone's main display. This fully customisable screen mainly serves to display notifications and audio playlist info, keeping the main screen uncluttered. The U Ultra runs a Snapdragon 835 processor, and has 4GB of RAM and 64GB of onboard storage (which can be extended with a microSD memory card).  HTC's other main innovation for this smartphone is an onboard assistant powered by artificial intelligence, offering users help and guidance. Sense Companion is relatively comparable to Google Assistant. In any case, it is a hot concept in the smartphone world right now, coming just a few days after Huawei presented the Mate 9 running Amazon's Alexa intelligent assistant at CES, Las Vegas (USA).    HTC's assistant is billed as an essential companion for Sense users, capable of offering contextual recommendations, such as suggesting an earlier wake-up time on the day of a morning meeting, or reminding users to charge a low battery before heading out for an appointment. It can also recommend nearby hotels and restaurants, for example. Recommendations and suggestions are based on user habits, and the system is designed to evolve over time as it gets to know the user.  This AI feature is also coming to the HTC U Play, a lower-spec model that doesn't have a second notifications screen and has pared down spec sheet compared with its top-end counterpart, including a single 5.2in display, 3GB of RAM and 32GB of storage.  The HTC U Ultra is due out from mid-February with the U Play expected in March. A premium "Sapphire Glass" 128GB version of the HTC U Ultra is also due to follow. All three handsets run the Android operating system with the HTC Sense user interface. — AFP Relaxnews You May Be Interested Boosting women's libido Glass discards now included in waste separation law Better rates via online forex services Paying high interest rates for personal loans Purple should be your favourite CNY colour Chinese herb Dang Shen helps to boost strength Others Also Read Roma win again despite Dzeko penalty miss Weekend Do Do we really need to fear China money? advertisement Latest News Sci-fi tech set for 2017 QLED vs OLED PCs on the rise Startup pays real people to answer questions to build better AI Dell Vostro 14: Value for money Most Viewed in Tech PCs on the rise Dell Vostro 14: Value for money Could your gadgets send you to jail?

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us ZTE to release new unified update for Axon 7 Mini, all devices to be updated to ‘Build 21’ By John Hoff - January 13, 2017 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter If you own a ZTE Axon 7 Mini in the US, you will currently be on one of three possible software builds – B12, B14MR2, or B16. ZTE USA is now releasing an update that will bring all Axon 7 Mini devices to “Build 21”, and it’s got some new goodies to go with it. If you are patching from B12 to B21, you will be getting the bulk of the new features for the Axon 7 Mini such as support for T-Mobile’s HD Voice call (VoLTE), new APN settings for all major North American mobile carriers, updated Google apps, and camera optimizations, among other upgrades. If you are patching from the two other builds, you will be getting Google’s security patches up to December, and this includes the B12 build as well. As per usual, ZTE recommends that you have a battery charge over 30% and download the update via a strong Wi-Fi connection to prevent update failure. You should be getting your update notification any time soon, but you can also check manually through your phone settings. Just to be sure, it will be good to back up your important data before you start the update.

Click here to support us on Patreon. ★ News TouchArcade Needs Your Help - Tell Your Friends and Support Our Patreon Author Eli Hodapp Posted On2017-01-13 21:15:20 Watch App   Featured, News It's a wrap for us this week here at TouchArcade, and provided nothing crazy happens in the world of iOS gaming, we'll see you again on Monday morning for Shaun's Update Mondays and Tasos's Touchstone Tavern Hearthstone [Free] roundup before diving in head-first to whatever awesome mobile games get released and whatever rad looking mobile games are coming soon. We've been doing this for years now, and to keep doing what we're doing, we need your help. Whether you're here for our game reviews, to read about upcoming games, find games on sale, listen to our podcast, or participate in your community, we're glad to have you. If the feeling is mutual, which I hope it is, there's a few things you can do to help keep TouchArcade alive in this weird changing world of mobile gaming, which for numerous reasons has jeopardized the future of third party editorial sites like ours. First off, and the easiest, tell your friends about TouchArcade. Practically everyone has a smartphone now, and as Pokemon Go [Free] has shown, even total non-gamers are playing mobile games. If you see your friends have a bunch of junky games on their phone, they'd probably appreciate learning about a site and community like ours where they can find good stuff to play. Tell them about our podcast, encourage them to register for our forums, whatever you're comfortable with. Organic growth via trusted word of mouth is the best way to get other great people onto our little island of appreciating great mobile games, which really just makes things better for everyone. Another easy thing you can do is if you read something on TouchArcade that you like, share it out to your online friends via Twitter or Facebook or posting the article on Reddit. Most of our traffic comes from Google, which means our top trafficked stories are consistently about (often dumb, or otherwise generally uninteresting) popular stuff. Shaun's RPG Reload series, which I think is some of the best content we put out, are always among our worst performing articles. I'd love if that eventually changed, but in order to get there, we need to depend on our core community of readers who I know appreciate our long-form content to help spread the word. Even a few people sharing those articles makes a significant difference. A lot of people seem to discover TouchArcade via our podcast, and both subscribing and leaving us an iTunes review helps us appear higher in the iTunes charts and search results. Also, going back to my first point, in telling your friends, if you know someone who listens to a lot of gaming podcasts, it'd be great if you could recommend they check out ours. All of those things can be done at no cost to you, and with practically no effort. If you want to help TouchArcade even further, these days we're primarily supported by Patreon. We're still a long way from our original goal which would allow us to do all sorts of stuff like creating even more content, cover even more events, and potentially even explore the feasibility of updating the existing app or creating an entirely new one. TouchArcade gets millions of visitors a month, and (as of this writing) barely over 500 of those people are Patreon backers. We'd love to see that number increase, as every dollar contributed directly goes back to making this site more awesome. Think of it as a magazine subscription, but you get way more than just one outdated issue a month. Even if you're not willing to do any of this, thanks for visiting TouchArcade. We'll see ya' next week.

Great podcast too. Happy to share and donate. Thanks guys. runesnatcher If you are looking for a Christmas gift for the gamer in your life, why not support this site in their name? SatanicWampa For me, Touch Arcade is like the IGN of mobile. I seriously wouldn't have discovered, much less even bought like 90% of my phone games if not for this site. Totally an invaluable resource for anyone remotely interested in playing worthwhile games on their phones or tablets. Anotherkellydown +1 lezrock +1 Dragan If so many people, including myself, are enjoying T.A. and so little of them seem to care about supporting the service then maybe it's time to make it a payed app. It could also help to give a iap (subscription) option since a lot of people are still hesitant to make financial transactions over the internet, I'm one of them. But if I could help through a iap I would be glad to do so. I would only expect more reviews. Furthermore I think it's ridiculous that Apple don't support a site which stimulates the sales of games so much. They reap the benefits without any investment. If T.A. and Pocket gamer wouldn't exist then a lot of releases would stay unnoticed. Amenbrother Totally agree make a paid app or put a IAP in this one and I would be happy to help. Tallgeese Sorry, as nice as an idea as that would be as far as I know, the TA app cannot be updated to include that feature. . TA's app-store-like (non-rogue-like) feature eventually became a no-no on the app store but fortunately Apple has not removed it entirely. In addition, Apple gets 30% of whatever purchases are made in the app store, so 30% or your hypothetical in-app donations would be given to the... 11th largest corporation by revenue, something it no-no needs. . I know what you're thinking, "but, Tallgeese, isn't a 'no-no' a double negative, therefore making it a positive?" And that I question I must only answer with a riddle, "If you could see the zenith of the highest mountain from the very bottom of the Earth, would there still be a reason to climb to the precipice, keeping in mind that the high ground is indeed the superior sniping and lightsaber defensive position?" Therein you must clearly see the folly of your quest, Gogmagog. For mankind shall never allow for a giant such as ye to tower over him in any pursuit other than your own crystalline awareness of intellectual and ontological purity. . And, really, who names their child "Gogmagog?" Parents these days... ROGER-NL Yeah, I wanna pay via the TA app, make this happen please. loox Ok. I just subscribed to the podcast and left a review. How could I not when you two just took the cutest picture ever!!??!! TechUser2011 I don't understand why TA needs direct sponsorship. You're a sister site of MacRumors, right? They don't ask for direct donations. And I see as many ads on TA as I do on MacRumors. http://www.wavelightgames.com/ WaveLightGames Increased my pledge amount. You guys are the only some indie devs like myself even get noticed in the app store. DeNappa "potentially even explore the feasibility of updating the existing app or creating an entirely new one." As if Apple would allow that ;( Luigi_Mario I'd recommend biting the bullet on sponsored content and/or something like Amazon product recommendations. As long as it's properly labeled, I don't think there's much of a downside. Tallgeese Kickstarter something nuts! ... Either the thing you're kicking is nuts or the digital reward is digital peanuts... Either way please put me down for "holding hands for the poor." profhuggybear Ok I just tried three times to sign up for the patron and give you guys some money with no luck. Kept getting an error saying I needed to try a different browser. I'm on my phone and can't give you guys some money?! Please look into it. I really enjoy your site and want to support the work you do. I'll check back tomorrow. mark@hollyandsmith.com Same here I've tried a number of times to join from my phone but always get an error message after I confirm thumbs07 I told my non-IOS loving friend. He raised an eyebrow. Spudboy If you are ever able to update the app. Include a 'tip jar'. I tip the developer of Downcast often. That's how I hear the podcast. Baron Cappuccino Like a few others here, I just tried to sign up for Patreon, but I have to wait till tomorrow to continue on my laptop. Patreon's flaws aren't TA's fault, but if any organization needs its fundraising to be mobile- iOS even- compatible, it's TA. I wonder if that's holding back recruits? Baron Cappuccino I figured it out. After you get rejected, go to safari and the patreon page should be on top. Go into the menu and find where you can set up payment sources. In my case, I chose PayPal. Get that done and then go back to TA here, because patreon won't have you supporting anything. Choose the link here and pick your donation again. This time it will work. lezrock Awesome work and dedicated mobile gaming journalism guys. Keep it up. It's much needed! lezrock Flatr is a thing here in germany. Shkrbby This app and its website are not bad in its current capacity, however I believe that it could be made even better with much more diverse content, at least for us oldies. For example, why not have a regular, say monthly, feature where you go behind the scenes of gaming to bring us indepth interviews with the devs and/or indie labels? Who they are, where they live, what's their studio is like, what apps do they use, where do they source they ideas/inspirations from? Who knows it might inspire some Flappy Golf playing schoolie into developing the next Imbroglio. runesnatcher Come on people - put your money to work for what you love. Chip in! rezn I increased from a $5 a month contributor the last couple years to a $10 lover of all things TA. Thanks for kicking ass again and again.

But that was five years ago. It's only with Chrome 56, the browser's next major revision, that FLAC will be playable natively. The original "bug", filed on August 23, 2011, can be found on the Chromium issue tracker. Over the years, it received the odd bit of attention, but nothing of real substance. This however, didn't stop ChromeOS and Android getting support, not to mention Apple's mobile and desktop operating systems. Finally, late last year, the issue was subjected to a flurry of activity, culminating in its official implementation. And, once Chrome 56 hits — which should be the end of this month, if the schedule sticks — everyone will be able to enjoy native FLAC support. My question is: Does the guy who filed the request still uses Chrome? [Chromium, via 9to5Google] Comments brettanthony @brettanthony Jan 14, 2017, 5:24pm Does the guy who filed the request still uses Chrome? I doubt it, he couldn't put enough fuckin memory in the computer to run it, so he has long switched to...(insert your favorite browser here...)

Claiming to use up to 75 percent less bandwidth, RAISR analyzes both low and high-quality versions of the same image. Once analyzed, it learns what makes the larger version superior and simulates the differences on the smaller version. In essence, it’s using machine learning to create an Instagram-like filter to trick your eye into believing the lower-quality image is on par with its full-sized variant. “This event was off the charts” Gary Vaynerchuk was so impressed with TNW Conference 2016 he paused mid-talk to applaud us. FIND OUT WHY Credit: Google Unfortunately for the majority of smartphone users, the tech only works on Google+ where Google claims to be upscaling over a billion images a week. If you don’t want to use Google+, you’ll just have to wait a little longer. Google plans to expand RAISR to more apps over the coming months. Hopefully that means Google Photos. Sorry Pied Piper.

The video went viral on social networking site Facebook and YouTube. Sumit Kumar was detained along with his friend Satyajeet Kadyan, 25. Kumar had uploaded the video on his YouTube channel — The Crazy Sumit . The video was shot by Kadyan, who also has a channel on YouTube as “DC Prank” since September 2016. The two are final-year students of World College of Technology and Management in Gurgaon. Joint commissioner of police (crime) Ravindra Yadav said, “During questioning Sumit claimed that the women seen in the video were his friends. The video was shot to get maximum hits. Investigations are in progress and we have to verify their statements”. Yadav said that both shot such ‘pranks’ to get maximum hits. “We have been told YouTube used to pay them Rs700 to Rs800 for 1,000 likes. Both have been even felicitated by YouTube for maximum hits on their pranks. Investigations will be also conducted to assess the criminal liability of the event management company, YouTube and Google,” Yadav added. However, a spokesperson of YouTube said, “YouTube’s community guidelines prohibit content featuring things like harassment, hate speech, shocking or disturbing content, illegal acts, and graphic violence, and we give our users tools to flag content so that we can review and remove anything that violates our policies. We also comply with valid legal requests from authorities wherever possible, consistent with our longstanding policy.” Once the investigations are completed, decision will be taken about the culpability of the persons involved in it. Kumar told police that he planned to film the ‘prank’ in December and later it was shot at Connaught Place and two other places in Gurgaon. Police said the statements of the girls will be taken to ascertain the facts. Yadav said, “Sumit said that he has been awarded a trophy also in October 2016 by YouTube for surpassing 1, 00,000 subscribers on his channel”. He further said, “We have to verify all the claims made by the duo during questioning. The progress will go on and we have to contact YouTube and Google also in this regard.” Police have recovered two laptops, one video camera, wireless microphones from them. Earlier police had taken suo-moto cognizance and a case was registered under section 67 of IT Act and Section 354 of Indian Penal Code at police station EOW. Cyber Cell of Crime Branch was tasked to nab the accused. During investigation, details of YouTube account ‘Crazy Sumit’ were obtained. As investigations have been initiated, Yadav said, “We will have to change the sections also in this case. There are many people involved in this process as per the statement of the detained youths. We will also check bank account of these two men to ascertain the detail how much many they have received so far”. Both were arrested on Friday from Ashok Vihar Phase-III after a raid was conducted at Kumar’s house. Sumit had created his channel one-and-half-year ago. Three years ago, he met with an accident and got bedridden for two months. In this period, he used to watch prank videos on YouTube, said police. He got the idea to earn money by making his own prank videos. He has made 35-40 pranks videos, police added.

Indie-punk drummer, Mithy Tatak, is part of an all-girls band The Vinyl Records, (above left) Pragati Soni worked odd jobs to keep alive a band formed in the office gym with her colleagues, (above right) Naama Choonawala drums with two bands while schooling kids in beats Shares15 Sohini Das Gupta | Sat, 14 Jan 2017-07:20am , DNA In a music space marked by an uneven gender ratio, female percussionists have to beat more than their drum skins to be heard. Three women drummers share their journeys At 27, Naama Choonawala has come a long way from the college days of parking herself behind drum kits at Mumbai's music store Furtados, where she'd spend hours perfecting beats. All because her interest was deemed "too noisy" at home. The secret thrill of buying her first drum kit without her parent's knowledge or assembling it in bits and parts at a friend's place before each rehearsal paid off rather well; Choonawala now drums with Indie-folk band Stella by Starlight, and Reggae-Dancehall outfit Riddim Funktion, besides freelancing and schooling kids in beats. It was a public performance debut at St. Xaviers' College festival-Malhar, with up to seven hours of rigorous practice thrown in at different stages, that saw Choonawala graduate to gigs at Blue Frog, NCPA, Kala Ghoda Arts Festival, Ziro in Assam and Shillong's Beer Fest. But hard work wasn't the only curve ball. As a female drummer, Choonawala has not so much borne the brunt of dismissal as of gender-based fetishization. "The whole idea of a girl drumming is hyped and considered exotic," complains Choonawala. She's not wrong. A Google search with the key words drummer+girl throws up, among other things, articles on 'cute', 'beautiful' drummer girls, along with tips to date one. For a dedicated musician, "it's frustrating, because such notions take away from one's art". And it is safe to say that Choonawala's art has her full attention, as she talks spiritedly about "practicing the same thing over and over again so as to develop muscle memory". Ask her what she likes best about being a part of the two bands and she revels in the feat of straddling genres. "Reggae is a lot of fun! Stella's music, on the other hand, may not be rhythme-driven, but it requires the drummer to hold down the song," Choonawala points out. When Mithy Tatak's cousin urged her to explore an instrument in high school, he had no idea she'd zero in on drums. But it was the instrument that appealed to Tatak "most naturally", and for the musician from Arunachal Pradesh, now 26, there was no looking back. The Indie-punk drummer who describes her style as "upbeat noise-punk" is a part of all-girls band The Vinyl Records. Tatak laughs about how, for the longest time, her family had no inkling of her passion. "I joined a music school but my parents, in another part of the country, had no idea," she says. Startled as she was, Tatak's mother responded with pride as she watched her daughter unleash her skills live at the Ziro Festival of Music in 2013. But the rush came with the occasional dampener of being critiqued and patronised as a girl drummer. "I've been asked to drum like a man in order to be better. Double-base and metal drumming, styles I am currently uninterested in, have been suggested, just because they'd look cool," shrugs Tatak. "Arm strength and power can be developed, but drumming is about technique," insists Tatak, before humouring her detractors. "What is drumming like a man anyway?" Gender was never a consideration in Pragati Soni's musical household when she was growing up. With father Suresh Soni engaged as a rhythme arranger for Bollywood greats like Laxmikant Pyarelal, her relationship with beats was organic. "I started unconventionally, gathering my experience at Navratri functions over energetic garba beats," recalls Soni, who is in her late-30s. College in the 90s opened her up to Bollywood, Pop, Classic and Alternative Rock. "Michael Jackson's music was a huge inspiration," reveals Soni, sharing her weakness for songs like Billy Jean, Man in the Mirror, Black or White, where even the most basic beats sound so beautiful!" Over the years, Soni worked odd jobs, punching overtime to keep alive a band formed in the office gym, with colleagues. Yet, Soni's career has been fraught with isolated opportunities. "I've contributed to the sound of the Om Shanti Om's song Dhoom Taana, and worked in an Ela Arun album, but the offers have been few and far in between. Perhaps it's because not everyone takes women percussionists seriously," she reasons. "I'm still learning," she says, crediting her father in sealing her faith in music, and her mother, in herself.

Shares62 Sumit Kumar Singh | Sat, 14 Jan 2017-06:45am , New Delhi , DNA Police detained the youths on Friday in Delhi but later allowed them to go after the men made a startling revelation There is now a twist in the 'Crazy Sumit' video case. Earlier, the video, uploaded on social media, showed a youth forcibly kissing women in Connaught Place as a prank. The video was uploaded by two youths in a bid to get hits on social media. Police detained the youths on Friday in Delhi but later allowed them to go after the men made a startling revelation. They claimed the women — being shown forcibly kissed — were actually their friends and had consented to being kissed. The men said they had promised them a share of the money they would make from the hits generated on YouTube. Sumit Kumar Singh, 20, and Satyajeet Kadian, 25, students of Bachelor of Computer Application of a private college in Gurugram, said that not only were they innocent, but there was nothing wrong in what they had done. "There is no illegality in the act, as in movies also, there are kissing scenes," Kadian told DNA. Earlier, Joint Commissioner of Police Ravindra Yadav Sumit was picked up from his residence in Gurugram after a raid. "A laptop, video camera, wireless mikes and a trophy given by YouTube to 'The Crazy Sumit', congratulating him for surpassing 1,00,000 subscribers were also found at his house. Kadian was also detained from the same area," said Yadav. Yadav blamed Google and YouTube for encouraging such "obscene activities." The police said that they will investigate the roles of Google, its video-sharing site, and an event management company to assess their criminal liability in the making of this video that was first shared from a YouTube Channel in the name 'Crazy Sumit'. The police stopped short of arresting the duo after they claimed that the women were their friends. A senior officer said his team will get in touch with the girls to verify the claim. If the men's claims are true, the police may not be able to press charges of molestation and can only possibly book them under Section 67 of the IT Act that pertains to transmitting obscene material in electronic form. Earlier, a case under IT Act and molestation was registered by the Cyber Crime Cell. As to how the men earned the money, Yadav said: "YouTube paid Rs 700 for every 1,000 hits their video received," said Yadav. He added that he had received this information after questioning Sumit. "The trend is to shoot obscene videos to get more hits and thereby more money. YouTube and Google also give them incentives like recognition and certificates in parties organised by them. They are also hired by manufactures of games and apps to advertise for them," said the officer. Yadav gave a recent example of an event management company, which had allegedly thrown a party at a restaurant in Connaught Place to felicitate those whose videos had earned the most hits on YouTube. "YouTube has been organising various parties and day seminars to encourage such activities by pranksters. These type of parties are being hosted by a company named Menaki Communication based in Gurugram and Mumbai on behalf of YouTube and Google," he said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Microsoft announced Friday a deal to buy Maluuba, a Montreal startup focused on making machines able to think the way people do. Bringing on board Maluuba co-founders Kaheer Suleman and Sam Pasupalak, along with their team from the startup, was intended to accelerate Microsoft’s “ability to develop software so computers can read, write and converse naturally,” the company said. Microsoft did not disclose financial terms of the acquisition. “Maluuba’s vision is to advance toward a more general artificial intelligence by creating literate machines that can think, reason and communicate like humans — a vision exactly in line with ours,” Microsoft artificial intelligence and research group executive vice president Harry Shum said in a blog post. “I’m incredibly excited about the scenarios that this acquisition could make possible in conversational AI.” Tech giants Apple, Samsung, Google and Microsoft are all vying to develop the most sophisticated connected assistant — working to give software the ability to understand what people say and even anticipate desires or needs. Amazon virtual assistant Alexa was a star at the Consumer Electronics Show gadget gala last week in Las Vegas. Amazon and Alexa face fierce competition. At CES, computer chipmaker Nvidia said it would use Google Assistant for its interactive streaming devices. Microsoft’s Cortana will power a voice-assistant speaker for kids and families being introduced by Mattel, and will also be in Renault-Nissan’s connected car hub. Samsung’s smart refrigerator, which acts as a connected hub — with a voice activation system unveiled at CES — uses the South Korean giant’s Tizen operating system. Many smart devices for the home also integrate with Apple Home Kit, which uses the iPhone maker’s artificial intelligence and voice assistant Siri. At CES, Chinese giant Baidu showcased its own virtual assistant “Little Fish” which will debut in China this year.

Home Opinion Bitcoin effect: RBI eyes blockchain tech; for a govt pushing Digital India, this could be a force-multiplier Bitcoin effect: RBI eyes blockchain tech; for a govt pushing Digital India, this could be a force-multiplier Though governments and banks may be wary of Bitcoin and its application, the technology behind the crypto-currency—blockchain—is what has attracted attention of many. By: The Financial Express | New Delhi | Published: January 14, 2017 6:18 AM The central bank’s research arm, Institute for Development and Research in Banking Technology, has released a White Paper saying that the technology has matured enough to be considered for various uses across the spectrum. (Reuters) Though governments and banks may be wary of Bitcoin and its application, the technology behind the crypto-currency—blockchain—is what has attracted attention of many. In India, three private sector banks—ICICI, Yes and Axis—have already instituted the technology for domestic financing, intra-bank transactions and cross border remittances, with many more vying potential uses for the technology. But, now blockchain is expected to get a much-needed push, which may make it one of the primary platforms in the country. The central bank’s research arm, Institute for Development and Research in Banking Technology, has released a White Paper saying that the technology has matured enough to be considered for various uses across the spectrum. Moreover, the research also showcases a proof-of-concept study on its potential use in trade finance. Blockchain or distributed-ledger-technology, is more like a shared Google spreadsheet, but much more secure. Like a spreadsheet, all transactions are visible to anybody on the platform, but only those with requisite authorisation can make changes to it. This is what makes blockchain reliable and faster in instituting contracts and making payments. Though blockchain, combined with the internet of things, has found uses in building smart contracts and niche insurance products, one of the major drawbacks is the inability to interlink different players. Goldman Sachs and a consortium of banks had created a research firm, R3, to build upon blockchain, but ultimately most left the consortium to develop their individual technologies. You may also like to watch this video If RBI were to bless blockchain, however, it would ensure participation from the industry. So, instead of each bank creating its own set of systems, there would be one central interconnected chain which every bank would adhere to for inter-bank transactions. In the case of transfer of funds or extending a credit line, a common blockchain can not only ensure which lender has taken money from which bank, it can lead to faster processes within the banking system. The White Paper goes beyond this, and talks of using blockchain in trade finance, cross border payments, capital markets, loan syndication and supply-chain financing, all of which can lead to smart contracts being enforced electronically, and in real-time. While the digital currency that the paper talks of is quite some distance away since no country has reached this stage, there is considerable work that can be done immediately in the non-banking space as well. While the customs department should start work on blockchain for real-time tracking of data, land-registry is an obvious area that would benefit from what blockchain has to offer. For a government pushing Digital India, this could be a force-multiplier. Please Wait while comments are loading...

Music News Entertainment Politics Features Share < br />this article: Kentucky law would ban sex with cats and dogs (sex with farm animals would still be okay) In News by Jamie Peck / January 13, 2017 Share < br />this article: Follow @jamie_elizabeth The state of Kentucky may soon pass a law making it a felony to have sex with cats and dogs, but not other domesticated animals. Introduced by Republican State Representative Wesley Morgan, House Bill 143 would make it a felony to sexually assault a dog or a cat but says nothing about other, just as fuckable animals like goats, pigs and sheep. Such acts used to be covered under an anti-sodomy law, but that law was recently struck down for being unconstitutionally applicable to consensual, human-on-human action. Kentucky is one of nine states that currently do not criminalize sexual acts performed upon non-human creatures, a loophole which has already caused problems prosecuting several animal-related sex crimes you don’t want to Google. Animal cruelty laws can be applied to such cases, but generally require proof of injury to the animal, and psychological scars can be hard to gauge when the victim lacks the power of speech. Dee Robinson of Kentucky Citizens Against Animal Abuse and Domestic Violence, who drafted the bill, said she chose to focus on house pets to avoid antagonizing hunters and farmers…which is probably more offensive to those groups of people than a blanket ban on bestiality, if you think about it. Via KLTV: “It was meant to concentrate on domestic pets because they are the ones that are so associated with the heinous crimes that involve children interchangeably,” Robinson said. “Sexual deviants use them interchangeably for their own perverted pleasures.” “We decided to take baby steps,” she added, to the Courier-Journal. “If someone wants to amend it to include all animals, that’s fine.” Spoken like a true pig fucker. Unfortunately for the cuddly critters of Kentucky, the bill is not likely to pass any time soon, as House Speaker Jeff Hoover said through a spokesman that while he’s against bestiality, the current legislative session should be reserved for “serious, economy-related bills.” Sounds like someone’s got some kitties and puppies to do it to.

(Reuters/Toru Hanai) Share Written by Mike Murphy January 13, 2017 Michael Lynton, the CEO of Sony Entertainment, Sony Pictures, and Sony America—the company has a rather complicated organizational structure—announced today that he will be stepping down from his positions to become chairman of Snap, the holding company behind Snapchat. According to a release from Sony, Lynton will step down this month to ensure a smooth transition for his successor. The Wall Street Journal reported in November (paywall) that Snap had filed paperwork with the US Securities and Exchange Commission to begin the process of an initial public offering, which could be valued as high as $25 billion. Lynton, who has worked at Sony for 13 years and was previously CEO of AOL Europe and a vice president at Time Warner, has served on Snap’s board for nearly four years. He was an early investor in CEO Evan Spiegel when Snap was still just Snapchat. “I have been involved with Evan and Snapchat since its early days, and given its growth since then, decided the time was right to transition and focus on my role as Chairman of the Board of Snap Inc,” Lynton said in Sony’s release. Startups have long tapped “professionals” to help them transition into stable, long-term businesses. Facebook brought in former Google exec Sheryl Sandberg as its chief operating officer; Google brought in Sun Microsystems exec and Novell CEO Eric Schmidt to be CEO; and Apple brought in Pepsi CEO John Sculley to run the company (if only for a few years). Snapping up Lynton is the latest sign that Snap is preparing for life after an IPO. Lynton could help Snap position itself as a social media company that knows how to work with the media and publishing industries, given his long history in both. Snapchat spends account for less than 4% of digital advertising budgets globally—Facebook and Google continue to dominate the market. But when Facebook went public in 2012, some analysts worried that it wouldn’t be able to compete with Google. Snap’s investors are surely hoping that, led by Lynton and Spiegel, the company can pull off a similar coup. Still, Lynton will be an interesting fit in a modern, software-focused social company like Snap. After Sony’s email and servers were hacked in 2014, he took to sending his office communications by fax. Read full story home our picks popular latest obsessions search

BlackRock managed to increase profits in the fourth quarter, though revenue barely grew. The firm was a prime beneficiary of a record year in exchange-traded funds. BlackRock attracted $140 billion to its iShares business last year, including $60 billion in fixed-income exchange-traded funds. Vanguard Group Inc., the second-biggest player in the exchange-traded funds business, gathered $93 billion. "In 2016, it is fair to say across all investor types there was a movement more toward passive strategies," Chief Executive Officer Laurence Fink said in an interview Friday after the earnings were released. "When I am able to increase margins and increase market share through price cuts I am going to do that. The key element is scale." BlackRock expanded its operating margin from a year earlier by keeping company costs down. The shares gained $1.06 to close Friday at $379.35. The company's fourth-quarter earnings of $5.14 a share exceeded estimates. Revenue rose 1 percent to $2.89 billion, falling short of analyst estimates of $2.93 billion. Lower performance fees and a stronger dollar contributed to the modest revenue growth. -- Bloomberg News Fireworks firm fined $200,000 for thefts NEW CASTLE, Pa. -- A Pennsylvania fireworks business used for many national events has been fined $200,000 by federal agents and ordered to close for two weeks after an employee stole fireworks. Family-owned Zambelli International Fireworks of New Castle blamed poor record-keeping on its failure to detect the theft. It has been ordered to improve its record-keeping. Zambelli said state police discovered the missing fireworks in 2014. Nobody has been charged. Zambelli was founded in 1893 and produces about 1,600 shows annually. Its fireworks have been used for presidential inaugurations, the National Mall Fourth of July celebration and state dinners. The company said none of its shows are scheduled during the two-week shutdown. The federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives won't comment because the investigation is continuing. -- The Associated Press Uber drivers in Russia quit over taxes MOSCOW -- Uber Technologies Inc. has asked its Russian drivers to temporarily bear the load of a new tax charge, causing some of them quit to avoid paperwork and tax filings. President Vladimir Putin signed a law in July to levy an 18 percent value-added tax on electronic goods and services provided by global Internet giants starting in 2017. Apple Inc., Alphabet Inc.'s Google, Microsoft Corp. and Netflix Inc. are registered with Russia's tax service, according to newspaper Vedomosti. Uber has passed these duties on to its drivers, requiring them to pay the tax on the company's service fee. Uber will later reimburse them these payments, it said in an emailed response to questions. The company will refrain from raising prices for passengers, it added. The move has caused some drivers to quit Uber, said Stanislav Shvagerus, head of lobby group Taxi 2018. Losing drivers is bad news for Uber, which has struggled to catch Yandex.Taxi, the market leader. "Most drivers only pay a unified annual tax linked to turnover," Shvagerus said. "Why should they start paying [value-added taxes] and become tax agents for a multinational firm? This requires weekly paperwork and also makes them subject to tax audit." -- Bloomberg News Indian airline, Boeing reach $22B deal CHICAGO -- Boeing Co. won a $22 billion deal from budget carrier SpiceJet Ltd., notching the plane-maker's largest-ever order from an Indian airline and strengthening its hold in a market dominated by Europe's Airbus Group SE. The order includes 100 of Boeing's 737 Max single-aisle jets and renegotiated terms for 55 previously ordered aircraft, SpiceJet said in a statement Friday. The airline also has options to purchase another 50 Boeing aircraft, including the 777 and 787 Dreamliner wide-bodies. The commitment, which was included in Boeing's 2016 order tally, comes as the Chicago-based plane manufacturer races to catch Airbus in narrow-body sales, the largest source of profit for the companies. The deal for the Max, which competes with Airbus's A320neo workhorse, also helps Boeing widen its footprint in the fast-growing South Asian market. Most of SpiceJet's low-cost rivals fly the European company's aircraft. "India is an important market both Airbus and Boeing can't ignore," said Shukor Yusof, founder of aviation consulting firm Endau Analytics. The SpiceJet order gives Boeing "a lifeline. There's a lot more to grow in India than other parts of Asia." -- Bloomberg News Developer calls for Gettysburg casino GETTYSBURG, Pa. -- A Pennsylvania businessman wants to build a harness racing track and casino near Gettysburg, the site of the 1863 battle that turned the tide of the American Civil War. David LeVan said Thursday he will apply for a harness racing license and a license to operate a casino with slots and table games. The proposed location on about 700 acres is just east of where U.S. 15 crosses the Maryland-Pennsylvania line. It's about 3 miles from the border of Gettysburg National Military Park. It's LeVan's third attempt to bring gambling to Gettysburg. He is a former Conrail Inc. chairman who owns a nearby Harley-Davidson motorcycle dealership. Previous proposals sharply divided the community, and opponents argued it was not appropriate for the historic region. -- The Associated Press Business on 01/14/2017 Print Headline: Business news in brief Tweet ADVERTISEMENT More Business Profits at 2 big banks climb in '16 Renault's market value dives after emissions ...

Onyinyechi Njoku: Here Are A Few Things Nobody Told You About Pregnancy 12.01.2017 at 9:30 pm By Onyinyechi Njoku 53 Comments So when we were growing up, it was always great news to hear that Aunty Ola or Aunty Seun had a baby. Being the first born in my own family, I saw my mum have five kids after me – although, I was only fully aware of three or four of them. So I can say I have had a front seat view of the pregnancy process, so I always thought “How hard can it be?” I’m going to shoot those babies out like a gum ball machine. Piece of cake. Now here’s the thing, nobody prepares you for the realities of being pregnant. After all, women have been doing this forever, so it’s expected that as an African girl with child bearing hips, you should rise to the occasion with all tenacity. Our mums, grandmas and aunts tell us that pregnancy is a beautiful experience…’ashi ashi!’ as my people would say. LIES! See, I am not here to scare anyone, but pregnancy is not fun. There, I said it. I have had a lot of people try to hush me when I say this – claiming that I’m being ungrateful! But, hey when we ladies gather in our secret places, we spill, we all agree that pregnancy is haaaaaarrrd work. As soon as you do the urine test and see those two crimson lies, you are to expect these and more: Get ready for the waterworks down below In other words (you go piss tire!) You laugh oh, you pee a little; you cough, you pee a little; you work out, you pee…I mean, any form of exertion makes you pee. Before the day is over you can go like 32 times. I was one of those women who could never pee outside, but one day in my seventh month, I went out with the hubs, there was no bathroom in sight, I just had to go. I took hubby along so he could cover me. We went to the back of our car and I did it under the beautiful Nigerian sun and it felt good. Sex may become a chore If you are the type who loves to get freaky between the sheets, please do not be disappointed if your libido wanes. For some reason you can’t even get wet. Hubby will whip out all the tricks in his box, yet my “wetin call” will be there staring at him, as dry as ever, like you are trying to draw water from a rock. It’s frustrating, I tell you; and when your belly is a lot bigger, heaving the extra weight around mid-coitus isn’t fun either. So all these people who say that pregnancy sex is the bomb, please share some of your tips, because my “huuhaa” didn’t get that memo. Key me into your “rhea”. Sound sleep will become a luxury So my fave sleeping position is to lie on my belly. Of course, you can’t sleep like that when your belly gets bigger, and these doctors’ advise that you should sleep on your left side, which gets pretty uncomfortable after a while. Coupled with your having to visit the bathroom 9 times before daybreak. It’s no wonder you can’t get some decent shut eye. Even when you do get to sleep, your snoring will probably wake the whole house. Hubby had to leave the room for me a number of times. Your looks may take a nosedive(literally) One of my fave features on my face is my nose. I love my nose; so, imagine my horror when 7 months down the line I couldn’t recognise this pretty part of me. The thing swelled to almost double its size. In fact I`m yet to see any woman who has escaped the preggy-nose syndrome. Then, I had hyper-pigmentation. My legs got swollen. Mine wasn’t so bad anyway. My cousin had to deal with skin issues, huge pimples on her face, even inside her ears. I have seen women have serious eczema. A friend of mine had to deal with huge, dark varicose veins on her limbs. You may get depressed I hear about post-natal depression a lot, but no one seems to talk about what happens to your mind while you are still pregnant. I was heading toward depression when I was pregnant with my first child. I hated looking at the mirror because I didn’t like what I saw. It was also frustrating when the shirt I wore 2 weeks ago wouldn’t button and I had nothing cute to wear. I had serious morning sickness, so I couldn’t keep any food down. I am a very active person so when pregnancy slowed me down I felt helpless. One warning: don’t ever Google your observations. When you feel something is off just go to your Ob/Gyn, because Google will send you to your death with their suggestions of ectopic pregnancy, eclampsia and other scary stuff. It’s great that we have the extended family system down here, the support can be really helpful. I had relations come around to take my mind off things when hubby wasn’t available. You will hear a lot of unsolicited, weird advice I loved coke when I was pregnant with my first. You know coke that is “mortuary standard”. Cold with a little ice in it. So I was drinking coke straight from the bottle, then this women told me, “my dear you shouldn’t be drinking from the bottle or your cervix won’t open at delivery, use a cup”. Chineke! How? What is the relationship between the bottle, my mouth and my cervix? Just Negodu! Then another told me not to cross my legs that baby will come out bow-legged. Don’t eat Okra soup or snails, so that your baby won’t drool a lot, and these are two of my favorite things. Then when I passed my de date, stop drinking cold water, do my exercise you have allowed the baby to relax. Some old lady even suggested I drink gin to shake the baby up a bit. I could go on and o. The craziness is limitless; but after all said and done, when the doctors put that little piece of heaven in your arms. It’s all worth it at the end. That’s why afterwards we go back and do it all over again. I swear women with plenty children dey try shaa. It also annoys the hell out of me when I hear that a pregnant woman was physically abused. Pregnancy is hard enough, as it is. How can you add to her stress? Don`t mind me if I have in any way discouraged you. It’s all for fun. If it’s that bad, I won`t be looking to do a third journey, “see my mouth na”. There are some perks though. Nigerians become really nice when they see a pregnant woman. You are allowed to not wait your turn at queues. You get lifts from nice people. You get discounts in the market as well. Oh, and your boobs get huge too! So if you are pregnant, keep your eyes on the prize. Enjoy the ride and have a safe delivery. If you are looking to conceive get ready for the time of your life, because it will happen and don`t say I didn`t warn you. So, comment and rant on what you dislike about being pregnant.

Love this! 34 Reply Uberhaute looks January 13, 2017 at 12:29 am The only moment I liked most was the first time the baby kicked! 1. Heartburn 2. Nausea 3. Edema 4. Cyst 5. Threatened abortion 6. Waddling 7. Urine and blood tests 8. Pigmentation 9. And many other crazy stuffs. When I had my baby, breast feeding was so stressful for me… I just hate it..It felt so weird and strange and even now, Had a very painful cs and I don’t think I can ever forget the experience. I’m kinda reluctant cos @32 weeks, i was already tired of the load but, I’m grateful to God for a super active, healthy and beautiful baby.

Love this! 2 Reply Anon January 12, 2017 at 10:23 pm I’m currently 12 weeks pregnant and it looks like I’m 6months pregnant cos I’m expecting twins. That peeing every minute thing no be lie. I had a bad cough from weeks 6 to 10 and I refused to take any drugs for it cos i did not want to harm my babies. My BN people, I suffered in those 4weeks. Any small movement has urine trickling down my legs. I had to practically live in the toilet, take my bath over 10times daily and of course couldn’t wear pants. On two occasions, I woke up to find out I had bedwetted because I was coughing while sleeping and leaking urine while coughing. Thank God for hubby, he jejely took the mattress out and cleaned me up. On that sex issue, no go there o. My juices are flowing like a tap. If i had my way, na everyday we go dey do but hubby is scared of pressing my belly and he doesn’t want to come from behind because he says he doesn’t want to scare the babies with his something *Rme*. How come you dint talk about the hunger? That is the worst part. I was a one meal per day person before pregnancy but now I eat every two hours. My bag is packed full when I’m going to work. All manner of fruits and nuts and of course food and before office close by 5pm, my body don dey shake. The tiredness nko? It’s on another level. Weight gain nko? I weighed 68kg before pregnancy. After 12weeks, I’m weighing 79kg. I dont don’t know how to go about that one. My noobs feels like blocks on my chest. Wearing bras irritate my breasts and hurts my chest but wetin I go do? I gasts wear bra na. I remove it once I’m inside the car tho. Mi o le wa ku. Best thing so far is my skin. So fresh, So clean, So supple, no pimples, no acne. This is the freshest my skin has been since i was a teenager and I pray it continues that way. If you are a First time mother, join nairaland pregnancy group. You will learn a lot. Also,try to have the Babycenter app on your phone. It really helps. As much as you can,besides registering for antenatal in your HMO, Also register in a govt hospital, especially the maternity ones and attend ANC classes there. You will learn a lot. Love this! 127 Reply kilipot January 13, 2017 at 4:19 am Please and please (for emphasis). Biko. Try and wear bra o. You possibly need a new size or ones without under wire. I also didn’t like wearing bra. Took them off while In the car and was fully naked at home. You may not like what they become after pregnancy. I’m just 2 months post pregnancy and Olympus has fallen. Love this! 66 Reply Onyinyechi Njoku January 13, 2017 at 11:50 am My sister if we begin talk everything, na thesis oh…Oh my Gosh! the hunger is on another level, I took cereal one sunday morning, only for me to get to church and start shaking, it wasn’t even offering time yet, as far as I was concerned the preist was talking to himself, my body was screaming for food, literally, I kuku left to go get something to eat, I couldn’t just endure Love this! 10 Reply ThatGhanaChick January 13, 2017 at 1:35 pm I laughed so hard at the bra part. My dear I woke up this morning with my left leg stiff as ice! all because i have been sleeping on that side through out Kai! you forgot to mention the muscle pulls that wake you up at night? smh come and see me wailing like a baby 3 days ago, I just couldn’t help myself, before i got pregnant i had never experienced a muscle pull ever. For me I am unable to eat and I haven’t gained even up to 7kg in this 28 weeks. I have no cravings (except for pringles every now and then). My feet will swell if I don’t elevate them, I mean this journey has a mind of its own. I thank God all the same. Abeg let me go and pee as it is pressing me wella. brb Love this! 10 Reply ulumma January 14, 2017 at 7:45 am Ahhhhh the muscle pull is so annoying. I had to hit my husband so hard one night as he didn’t hear me screaming right beside him. The screaming only took my mind off the coast excruciating pain. It a lot of massaging and toe stretching to stop the pain. Love this! 3 Mumof3 January 13, 2017 at 3:56 pm This hunger thing many women talk of I have never experienced it. This is my 3rd baby and during pregnancy one meal a day is enough for me. I also lack cravings but love water and drink lots during pregnancy. On another note how do women cope with questions from people like when are you having a boy? Awww sorry you don’t have a boy etc. I’m on my 3rd girl. It makes me feel low a time times when people say such things because I have never felt anyway about having girls. I just wanted healthy children. Love this! 9 Reply Selina January 12, 2017 at 10:28 pm I concur. I did experience some of those “blessings” if l am allowed to call them that but not all. My face wasn’t puffy nor my legs swollen. Truly when my babies came, I fell in love with them instantly. Love this! 11 Reply Lala January 12, 2017 at 10:33 pm Chai, nne, you finished this matter. I am pregnant now and l feel like my life was disrupted. I stopped work (even though I am self employed) I was slightly depressed for most of the first 3 months and my mouth was severely bitter. One good thing is that I have only vomited twice. I have some weeks to go and yet everyday I keep saying, God, let this thing be done and dusted for good, I don tire. I am an extremely active person but because I got to my mid thirties before be coming pregnant, I chose to put business and anything major aside as I can’t risk adding stress to this pregnancy. Mehn, the baby’s kicking is not a small something. Plus in this abroad,there’s little or no help. Every woman who works whilst pregnant, I salute you although pregnancy is effortless for some women. Let us never compare ourselves with others as no 2 women’s pregnancies are the same. Finally, to every woman who has carried a pregnancy and lost the baby especially after 9 months, may God Himself comfort you and recompense you according to your heats desire. After all the pain and stress and anxiety and depression, to loose a baby is hell and may no one have to bury their children this year in Jesus name, amen. Love this! 175 Reply Lala January 12, 2017 at 10:39 pm Hearts desire Love this! 10 Reply Onyinyechi Njoku January 13, 2017 at 11:53 am Thanks a lot, your compliments mean a lot…and I echo a big Amen to your prayer…Having to go through all this only to have a dead baby must be the worst thing ever. I had a miscarriage at 7 weeks, and I cried my eyes out.I can only imagine that happening when the pregnancy has really gone far, or even having a stillbirth. May God not allow us to cast our young. Love this! 14 Reply that uptown girl January 12, 2017 at 10:33 pm I can relate, I had my baby recently. When I first knew I was pregnant I thought cool, no period for 9 good months? Awesome! By the sixth week I wished for period to come again. The nausea was weakening, the tiredness, constipation, heartburn, just horrible. I stopped feeling like a human being. Then in the last trimester, when you get real heavy, to turn from side to side on the bed or even to get up is wahala, then multiply that wahala by how many times you have to pee every night. As horrible as pregnancy was I didn’t believe I’d miss it, but for a day or two after my baby came I missed having her so close inside me and all the symptoms. There are a few good things though- pregnancy sex is just the best, well, right until the last month when we couldn’t find any suitable position and it became two awkward and tiring trying, people are usually nice and considerate, on a more personal level, my husband did everything for me except cooking, he pampered the hell out of me. I tease him and say you do all that because you love me he says it’s because I am pregnant and when I give birth he’ll stop, but I know say na lie. And no one tells you that labour is that painful Love this! 31 Reply Neerah January 12, 2017 at 10:46 pm Well, my pregnancy was mostly fun,apart from the morning sickness I experienced in the first 3 months, I didn’t gain weight, I had no cravings, I didn’t pee all the time, in fact there were days I only peed once or twice a day, no spitting , I slept well, in fact I overslept during my pregnancy, no stretch marks also. Ice was much best friend during pregnancy, I so loved to chew on ice. My sex drive however went down the drain, the mere thought of sex irritated me, hubby understood n stayed away, lol….however around 36 weeks, my BP started to shoot up and I had to be induced at 38 weeks. Meeting my beautiful princess was the best feeling ever. Love this! 27 Reply mee January 13, 2017 at 1:43 am Wow!…sounds exactly like my sister’s pregnancy..from her ice cravings, to not adding a single weight, to her BP shooting up, to delivering her pretty princess at 38weeks….I mean everything! Love this! 9 Reply mee January 13, 2017 at 1:44 am She was also induced! Love this! 6 Anny January 12, 2017 at 11:11 pm Nice piece. My pregnancy was a miracle from God simply amazing honestly and having elder sisters I had seen all manner of pregnancy drama lol. I never had morning sickness, I barely had appetite my husband would come home from work with snacks,fruits,food practically anything he could find appetite say for where. The only symptom I had was swollen feet because I taught in a school for a bit. Delivery nko Hmmmmm, I was almost ready to pop not one single pain Infact that one na story for another day.

Love this! 3 Reply Zinny January 12, 2017 at 11:27 pm I am 33 weeks and whilst I waited for 4 years to get pregnant, I can’t wait to have this baby. I have a new found respect for women who have more than 3 children. I can’t particularly say I have had a bad pregnancy all through as I am still working 12 hour shifts, However I dread night time. I wake up every hour to pee, I need a crane to turn me. My gums are swollen and painful, my vagina hurts for no apparent reason , my nose bleeds daily , My sex drive is dead and I have not had sex since week 15, I almost yanked that thing off the last time hubby dared . I am praying to God this baby come by week 37 cos I can’t imagine doing this till 40 weeks. I know it will be worth it when I meet my little bubba. Love this! 27 Reply Onyinyechi Njoku January 13, 2017 at 11:57 am Awwwww! Congrats, God will surely perfect what he has started, you are already there. Love this! 6 Reply BDA January 13, 2017 at 12:15 am Hmmmm. Like i told my friend a few days ago, i miss being pregnant. My son was just so good to me. No nausea, vomiting, sleepless nights etc. I had swollen feet tho and I told doctor during ANC and he gave me tablets and fiam, the thing disappear. My appetite was ok and I always wanted cold water. Sex was good too, supple skin (my face was freshest), I worked till the end. I left work by 8pm on Saturday, had my 4.5kg overdose of cuteness by 7am on Sunday to the glory of God. I’m indeed blessed. Love this! 22 Reply Tosin January 13, 2017 at 1:06 am 😊😊😅 Love this! 3 Reply o January 13, 2017 at 1:09 am No swollen nose, no swollen feet no weight gain for me. In fact at every docs appointment during my antenatal, I had lost more weight. My tunny was so small like I just ate too much, not like pregnancy. Even my neighbours upstairs didn’t know I was expecting. I loved those days….. Love this! 22 Reply Fasholaslover January 13, 2017 at 1:35 am Spitting😟😓 Inability to keep food down except water.

Love this! 23 Reply Ah Be De January 13, 2017 at 3:07 am You know when you see that little bundle of joy, the kind of joy you feel is unexplainable. Sometimes i even feel like i’m obsessed with my baby. My pregnancy was tumultuous…Jesu oluwa o. I cannot wish what i went through on my enemy o. I spent the first few months crying because the pregnancy came like a disruption to my life. I wanted to start a new job and was actively hunting only to find out miss red had disappeared. Who will hire a pregnant woman? It was still early and not yet showing but I then started having ‘PREGNANCY BRAIN’, that thing is real y’all. My brain just became dull. I couldn’t remember information, I couldn’t get past two pages of a Book, I was studying for a licensing exam, I had to put it off as I couldn’t assimilate anything anymore. I had terrible mood swings. I could be laughing this minutes and shedding so much tears the next. My husband got tired one day and called my mum to help him😂. My mum said, ‘if you keep crying like this, you’ll give birth to a child who never stops crying’. I don’t know if thats true o but my brain just received some resetting after i heard that and I reduced my crying. I remember my mum also saying, ‘you better don’t frown when you’re in labor or your baby will come out ugly’😩. I used to throw up every day, the moment a toothbrush with toothpaste enters my mouth, next thing that erupts is yellowish substance. I vomited bile everyday till my third trimester. And then just as I was entering my third trimester, I was diagnosed with preemclampsia (without severe futures) and in a couple more weeks Gestational diabetes. I had to check my blood pressure 4 times a day and poke myself four times a day to check my blood sugar level. I refused to take all the glyburide and metformin i was prescribed, I controlled my sugars with diet. I couldn’t exercise so blood pressure doesn’t shoot up. Chei! I just thank God I survived and my baby didn’t die because at every visit to the hospital doctors were giving me bad news. My life is a testimony. Glory be to God. Love this! 62 Reply Sugar January 13, 2017 at 4:41 am I’m so thankful for this article and the comments. At 31 weeks I’ve asked that God in His infinite love will keep me going to the 38th week. It feels so good that I’m not alone and can relate with other people in this amazing journey. Love this! 23 Reply kilipot January 13, 2017 at 4:42 am Pregnancy is hard……post pregnancy is harder ( maybe it’s just me). I was balling till I got to my 8th week when all day sickness started. I had it all dizziness, headaches, nausea, vomiting , motion sickness ( stopped going to work cos i couldn’t ride in a car without throwing up) basically Hyperemesis Gravidarum.. heartburn, spitting, metallic taste in mouth, haemorrhoid, pelvic girdle pain abi is it SPD that one that makes ur pelvic bone snap while turning in bed or getting out of bed feel like you pelvic bone are grinding on one another. I couldn’t really walk properly – going up and down the stairs was a major work,…. people said all sorts to me. I was compared to other women who carries theirs easily but I thank God for my sister and mother. Fast forward to delivery.. my contractions started reducing at 6 cm having been I latent phase of labour for over 24hr and active for 12 hrs. I was told I needed an emergency c section. The pain afterwards is indescribable. The fast forward to breast feeding. I couldn’t even hold my baby close the pain, milk didn’t come in till the 3rd- had to introduce formula then latching issue came up. And then low milk supply. I felt i wasn’t “woman” Enough. Been depressed and all that. All in all I thank God for a good and understanding husband. Having gone through all these , then the issue of exclusive breastfeeding came up- In-laws made me feel like a failure the more. They remembered everyone who pumped 3-10 bottlers of milked before going to work lol. I thank God I’m in a better place. I’m finding myself back again. Oh and my body changed drastically – stretchmarks in places I through i had on lock doown. I will return to the gym in the nearest future as I’m almost mentally ready. Love this! 19 Reply theinformedmum January 13, 2017 at 7:00 am No one told me hemorrhoids could be a souvenir of pregnancy and childbirth. Now some favorite lovemaking postures remind me of that souvenir. Second trimester with my first pregnancy, I learnt of fibroid degeneration ;the pain was out of this world. I am yet to decide that and labour pains which hurt most. Currently ‘incubating’ my second child and swearing not to thread this pregnancy path again. Two pregnancies are enough for my lifetime. Shout out to all those mums who went through pregnancy more than twice. They are the super-women. Abeg, who was it sef that said women are “the weaker sex”? Love this! 22 Reply Aadey January 13, 2017 at 8:05 am As i read other people’s symptoms i began to wonder if i was normal. I pee alot but not as d writer and other people have described. Sometimes some other experiences are sooo different and difficult. I dont have cravings, i sleep all tru d night till abt 4am when the urine comes, apart from regular headaches and breast aches im fine! Iv vomited only 6times. Yes there were days i felt extremely ill but i think im getting over that now. But no one told me hair would grow in weird places, under my boobs, i have moustache now, my belly, my legs, my hands and den my nails are soooo hard and strong as well. D pubic hair is x2, i have tiny boils all over my private. Those are symptoms people rarely talk about. But like they say it will all be worth it when the precious one arrives!. Goodluck to everyone Love this! 13 Reply Preggy January 13, 2017 at 9:42 am I am in the last week of my second trimester. The First eight weeks was awesome no symptoms of any sort then came week 9-18 and Man oh Man i went through hell. The nausea was tremendous, smells irritated me so bad that i stopped using perfumes, deodorants, cooking, eating and seeing people, indigestion was real, severe pains in my pelvic, pregnancy brain, i lost so much weight i didn’t look pregnant for the most part. Then from week 20 till now, nausea has subsided but i still experience indigestion, pelvic pains, terrible pregnancy brain, my nose has felt the impact, I have no cravings, the funny thing is i am always hungry but i cant or don’t eat because the food doesn’t go down for hours and i mean 12-18 hours so frustrating. By the way since my 8th week my sex drive has been dead and hubby understands but I still take a painfully conscious effort to do it weekly. Oh i forgot to mention I sleep a lot now…. I wish there was a platform for expecting mothers and first time mothers to share experiences Love this! 8 Reply Kee January 13, 2017 at 9:43 am I am expecting my first baby at 36. I took in the first week of marriage, was not expecting it would happen that soon. Hubby (maybe because he’s a doctor), was the one who first informed me at the 3rd week that I was pregnant. “You lie boo”, I told him, I didn’t want it to be true. Here I am, 14 weeks, 4days. I can’t wait for it to be all over. My weight is at a constant 65kg, hasn’t changed much from what it was before the pregnancy except for the time I lost 2kg. I got slowed down after the 4th week and I’m only just getting my energy back. I am still barfing bile (it started somewhere around the 5th week), every time my toothbrush goes in, yellow comes out, so I have stopped brushing at night (and to think I used to be a strict night brusher!) My skin literally glows, I radiate, people have said, many already guessing I have a bun in the oven even though my stomach is just slightly bloated. My appetite is off and on, sex-drive zero, my hair lustrous and doing so well. Some nights (and days) I sleep so well, and on other nights I might just get in about 2 to 4 hours. My breasts are beautiful :), and well I am pretty much doing ok. I mostly feel like there’s an alien controlling my body, and my mood and can’t wait for him/her/them to come out so that I can get my revenge ;]. I guess it’s mostly the feeling that my life has been changed forever by one tiny miracle that leaves me reeling most days. I have a new found respect for mothers. Of ten, five or just one. You rock! Love this! 20 Reply Kofo January 13, 2017 at 10:45 am Hmmm no one also talked about been “Bloated” ,i was super bloated at the first 4 -10 weeks, i was super showing,some people thought i was nearly due, but that was far from it. Right now i am 20 weeks gone(happy i have passed the first trimester)as i had threatening abortion twice due to hermatoma,and i am battling with fibriods too. Though the bloating has stopped,but my belly is still so huge(fibroid)my Doc said i should just assume i am carrying multiples .But in all i give God the praise as it took us 2 years to conceive, this is my first and i am 35 so it hasn’t easy. Every week Doctors appointment after the 2 threats i had in my first trimester. Pregnancy though,its just a different ball game…I pray for a very healthy baby and safe delivery too. Please join me in prayers Y’all.

It’s also in afternoon, evening, night. All day every day. Funny enough, despite all this, I miss being pregnant. Something transcendental about it that makes you all goo goo on the inside.

I couldn’t talk or do anything I was terrible sick. I was so ugly and very dark, swollen legs, face, nose every part of me was so big. My pastor walked past me one day and didn’t recognise me until I spoke. Sex was no go area for me, I can go on & on, All this would have worth it if I met my son, he died few mins after he was born.

I’ve experienced all the symptoms by the writer and i bless God for an understanding hubby who would come home to do dirty dishes and make his own meal😊 Most frustrating for me is the little/non-existent appetite coupled with constant hunger bites even in the middle of the night😫 Just like the writer mentioned each person carries pregnancy differently but I guess in our culture people tend to criticise you for being open about your challenges and tell u to be grateful instead😩 My Aunty actually told me to stop complaining cos she worked till she was due with every symptom I’m having now!

In a day I pee not less than twenty times, especially at night. Sometimes I can’t sleep, lay down on the floor, sit down on the couch, walk around the house. I thank God because is such a wonderful experience as a woman. Am almost due can’t wait to hold my bundle of joy as a first time mom. Love this! 6 Reply Isioma January 13, 2017 at 4:51 pm During my pregnancy, I can’t fix my hair, all through the nine months of pregnancy. Weavons/ extensions irritate me, I can perceive them from afar and would be on the verge of throwing up. Am usually very strong all through the preg period and would work till my due date. It was only in my first preg that my baby gave my body a hard time. I collapsed several time because my body was not strong enough to manage the stress. I don’t eat much but I was carrying a heavy eater for a baby. Soon as she wakes up and I’ve not eaten something especially early in the morning, I would almost or actually pass out. I would be like a phone that the batt has run out. I won’t even be able stand, I would just fall, sometimes without knowing am about to pass out. What about that time during preg that one sweets like a ram to be slaughtered. The labour and delivery nko. Very painful experiences. I thank God for the grace to bring life into the world. Its a privilege given to only women. Love this! 7 Reply effy January 13, 2017 at 8:01 pm I love all the comments! Am 32weeks gone and I thought my own pregnancy is different until I read through this article. Has anyone experience inconsistent scan result as per the sex of the baby? Have done 4 scans and the result is conflicting. My fellow ‘Iya ibejis’ what can I do? #firsttimemum# Love this! 6 Reply Bee… January 14, 2017 at 1:50 am Reading all the comments at work and i’m laughing in tears… I’m a first time mum, almost 24weeks..Its different for me because i had a 8-12weeks miscarriage(didnt even know i was pregnant). I was over working then, took a day off when i found out i was expcting but then i lost it 2days after sadly 🙁 I had little or now symptoms during the first trimester (i just find it so hard to sleep at night), then i became normal after that, food is now my favorite thing, appetite has skyrocketed. then i’m about 3times my normal size, i had to buynew clothes (lol). even me that use to be in the small boobs league is now competing for large size (funny). My ultrasound recently showed that my cervix is short and it keeps getting shorter (this can cause premature birth before 7months and deformity in the child according to the obg) So i had a cervical stitch surgery just to keep it close, Obg said the stitch would be removed at 37weeks and no sex till further notice. Libido was high before nowbut protuding tommy is preventing it, now its on a shut down. I’m so praying to have a natural birth. and i plan on working till few days before EDD God help me, just because i started this job bout 2/3months ago and i dont want to look unserious. God help us all and keep our babies and unborn alive for us to see 🙂 Love this! 3 Reply Preggo January 14, 2017 at 9:04 am I am 28 weeks gone. The poster is so right, no one tells u how bad it can Get. My first trimester wasn’t so bad, loss of appetite and I only had nausea for 3 days. Was tired all the time and very dizzy. Then came second trimester and it starts getting weird, my hubby calls my nose rat nose. I could smell anything anywhere. I hated perfumes and deodorant, as in can’t stand it. Had to change my bathing soap cuz the smell was too strong. Food nko? I cudnt eat my own food (still can’t). Someone else has to make it and it has to be fresh. If it’s reheated, I can’t eat. Even the smell of raw eggs make me throw up. Wat about all the pimples on my face, chest, shoulders and my whole back? Stretch marks nko? Like tyre tracks on my stomach, upper bum and my hips. My face nko? I don’t recognize myself in the mirror anymore. Nose is double the size, cheeks so big and I look so pregnant! Constant peeing in the night and the hunger in the middle of the night and as soon as I wake up. Can’t sleep most nights cuz I can’t get a comfortable position. I could go on and on. But my little munchkin has turned my belly into football stadium. Kicking all the time. Feels good to know all these is happening to me cuz of it. I feel for those who lose their babies, I cant imagine the pain and depression.

MMM had announced the resumption on its Twitter handle, saying it was “now open” even though it had initially promised to reopen today, Saturday, January 14. In the message, the scheme’s founder, Sergey Mavrodi, said because of the likely deluge of requests from participants, payments would be gradual and have limits. He also said it would prioritise payments to participants with small amounts, which were not specified, and that big investors would have to wait longer. “Please, be prepared to wait for a couple of days. We are certain things will then calm down, and the system operation will return to normal. “We’re the ones setting limits, so it’s completely under our control, and we are not expecting any emergencies in principle. Have no fear and go on about your business as usual. “As the system is socially oriented, we will make paybacks to the poor and the economically disadvantaged in the first place; it means to the members with small PH (Provide Help) amounts. The richer can wait. Moreover, we’ve warned you repeatedly to only provide help with amounts that are not critical for you.” With about three million Nigerians involved in the scheme and huge investments at stake, the freezing of the MMM’s accounts a month ago had sparked fears that the ponzi scheme had crashed. Meanwhile, some investors have expressed their frustrations as they might have to wait much longer to recover their much needed money from the scheme. Some of the participants told Saturday PUNCH that their funds that were tied down in MMM were meant for various uses including purchase of goods, payment of tuition, debts, rent and others. The fears and frustrations are further heightened by MMM’s declaration that it would introduce bitcoins as the new mode of payment ahead of its comeback, which some participants of the scheme have described as confusing. For example, Frank Bunna who deals in computer accessories at Olugbede market in Idimu, Lagos, said he was stranded as he had invested all the money for his goods in MMM. The Igbo trader, who was looking dejected when our correspondent visited the market, said his future was dashed as he expressed disappointment that he would not be able to get his money back today (Saturday). He said, “This is my life! How will I live? I invested N2m! Look at my shop, it is totally empty. I invested the whole money for my business on this MMM; I even borrowed N300, 000 that I added to it. I spent six days in the hospital as soon as I heard the account was frozen. I am hypertensive so my blood pressure shot up when I heard the news. To hear that I would not be paid immediately means that I am dead.” Another Lagos resident simply identified as Korede, who invested over N500, 000 in the scheme, said, “There is going to be crisis in my home. I borrowed my wife’s N300, 000 to invest in the scheme. I didn’t tell her, but I guess she’s suspicious now. “I promised to return the money December ending, but couldn’t. That was when MMM froze our accounts. It appears that there is going to be some delay before I can get the money. I just hope my wife will forgive me in case this thing fails. To be sincere, I am afraid.” An undergraduate of the University of Benin, Benin City, Edo State, who identified himself as Chiboy because he did not want his parents to know he invested his tuition and money meant for his dissertation in MMM, said he had been left stranded since December 2016, when MMM was suspended and desperately needed his money back. “I had thought that I would be able to get my money back immediately MMM reopened but from what I heard, it would not be possible. My mother will kill me. I don’t even know what to do,” he said. A teacher in a private secondary school in Egbeda, Lagos, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the bursar of the school had invested N1.5m belonging to the institution in the scheme before the scheme was suspended last month. According to the teacher, when the bursar could not provide the money, he was sacked by the school management and asked to sign an undertaking to return the money when MMM reopened on Saturday, January 14. “The bursar has since been arrested and in his undertaking, he had said he would get the money back immediately MMM resumed operations. But with this development, it will take some time before he can get paid, and that is if he gets paid at all,” the teacher said. A travel agent in Lagos, who identified himself as Mr. Oduntan, lamented that he has been going through difficulty after investing N900, 000 meant for paying his rent in MMM with the hope that he would get about N1.2m in return. Oduntan said he was desperate to recover his funds as his landlord had been on his neck since then. Also, a banker in a new generation bank in Ikeja, Lagos, told one of our correspondents on condition of anonymity that three of her colleagues were sacked for introducing some customers to MMM. According to the banker, his colleagues were sacked after the aggrieved customers officially complained to the bank manager that they were stranded because they had invested in MMM, which was introduced to them by some employees of the bank. The source said, “The customers said they needed their money back. They blamed some of my colleagues for introducing them to MMM and the bank had to sack them. “One of the customers complained that the money he had put in MMM was meant to roof his house and that his planned relocation to the house has had to be delayed because of that. Another one said the money he had invested in MMM was meant to pay his debts while another said the money was meant for his wife’s business.” Another banker working in a commercial bank in Akute, Ogun State, also said one of her colleagues was sacked for investing N2m he had loaned from the bank in MMM and was unable to pay back the loan. A barbing salon operator in Ilorin, Kwara State, Adejare Lawal, who spoke with one of our correspondents on Thursday, said he had invested money belonging to some of his colleagues, which was from their contributory scheme, in the investment. According to him, he invested around N350, 000 in November, hoping to get a profit of at least N80, 000 by the second week of December before accounts were frozen. “This is the biggest risk I have taken in my life and at the moment all I can think about is how to get the money back. I was the one coordinating the barbers’ association’s contribution in my area and I invested it in MMM.” In Oyo State, an estate agent, Mr. Funso Ogungbade, said he had invested the sum of N3.5m, part of which was from the rents he had collected from tenants on behalf of some landlords, in MMM. “My target was that by Saturday, everything would be sorted out but as it is now, I cannot get the money back soon. MMM is saying that it will start by paying the people with small funds and that it will also put a peg on how much we can get,” he said. A student at the Ladoke Akintola University of Technology, simply identified as Wole, said he had invested N50, 000 into the scheme a week before it froze all accounts. Another MMM investor, who simply identified himself as Olayinka, said, “I’m desperate to recover my money. All my investment has gone into it,” he added. Olayinka, who lost his job over a year ago, said he had invested N700,000 that was paid to him as entitlement in MMM, given how profitable the scheme was before it collapsed. He said, “I have been counting down since the day MMM announced the closure. Everything I had went into it so I am seriously stranded.” Another MMM investor, Miss Janet (surname withheld), said, “I lied to my brother to lend me money to pursue my Master’s programme. I’ve not been working for some time, and he was the one who advised me to go for a postgraduate degree. So, when I asked for money, he gave me N150, 000. “With the way it was booming, I invested my N600, 000 in it, including the money I had saved from my previous workplace. So, I’m in a fix as I’m talking to you.” Our students invested school fees in MMM –VC On January 11, 2017, the Vice-Chancellor of Osun State University, Prof. Labode Popoola, told journalists that the school’s authorities would publish in national newspapers names of students who owe tuition, claiming that some of them had invested the money in the MMM scheme. Noting that the affected students had owed since their enrolment, Popoola said it had come to the knowledge of the school that most of them were enrolled in MMM. He disclosed that the cumulative debt being owed the school by the students was N2bn. He said, “We are aware that parents of most defaulting students had given them their school fees and it was revealed that the students had diverted the monies into the MMM scheme.” Confusion mounts over bitcoin Findings by Saturday PUNCH showed that more Nigerians have been searching for information about bitcoin on the popular search engine- Google. For instance, between Thursday and Friday, search for “where to buy bitcoin in Nigeria” on Google Nigeria rose by 200 per cent, according to Google Trends. Search for “MMM bitcoin” rose by 150 per cent; “What is bitcoin all about?” rose by 160 per cent; while “meaning of bitcoin” rose by 60 per cent. One of the participants who spoke with Saturday PUNCH, Bunna, said he had no idea of what bitcoin meant and that the more he asked questions about it, the more confused he got. “I don’t know what bitcoin means. Don’t even bother explaining how it works to me because many people have tried and they left me more confused,” he said. “Once I get paid, I don’t even want to be part of any MMM again. God knows that nothing in this world will make me do this nonsense again. While other people were celebrating Christmas, I was in the hospital. Even now, I have yet to recover, so why do you think I would want to do this kind of thing again?” Wole, a LAUTECH student, said, “Another problem now is the introduction of bitcoin to the platform. I have yet to fully understand how it operates. I will read more about it so as to know how to go about withdrawing my money. I just hope the system wouldn’t crash.” Speaking about the bitcoin option recently introduced, Janet said, “Whether bitcoin or no bitcoin, I want my money, possibly today (Friday).” Chiboy said he had only heard of bitcoins and was not interested in “such things.” Olayinka said, “They wouldn’t dare introduce bitcoin at this time. But if they do, we are at their mercy. I just want my money back http://punchng.com/investors-stranded-mmm-reopens/ 4 Likes 1 Share Re: Investors Stranded As MMM Reopens by AfonjasMustDie(m): 8:04am On Jan 14 What drugs are you on ??

Can't we have peace of mind without MMM ringing in one corner or the other? In saner climes, the government has a duty to ensure that its citizens physiological needs and safety needs are met, and also has a duty to help its citizens meet their love, belonging, and esteem needs. When this is done, you barely hear people complaining about one Ponzi scheme or the other as many people painted MMM to be. In addition, the real problem here is not MMM but the Nigerian Government. They have failed the citizenry and make them look average compared to what human standards should look like. When a nation through the office of its leadership can no longer perform its basic responsibility of provision of security and development, and has no effect control over its territory and border, this nation is termed a FAILED STATE. What do the citizen do in return? The government unknowingly to them have introduce chaos into the system! MMM is just a little problem and insignificant at the moment. Right now, there are more than 30 active PONZI schemes, though the figure will triple before the end of the year! Conclusively, MMM is really a case of "Shooting the messenger".

Of all the opinion pieces you had at your fingertips, you chose this cynical piece of education conspiracy theory? Come on now.   As we all know, our society and the world have changed drastically over the past decades and our public schools are scrambling to keep up with the speed of this change. They are constantly trying new ways to effectively teach children and meet the ever raising bar (and no, privatizing schools would not make them adapt quicker, just as they would still be in the same position today had they been privatized 40 years ago).  They are not, as Price describes, embracing the unacceptable as good enough, pretending to engage in serious educational activities, taking it easy, running in place, laboring mightily to undercut education, or excepting that kids don't need to read because they can go on welfare.   Give me a break.   What is more ridiculous is what he suggests schools should be doing. While he first says that "Education goals once considered reasonable are now scorned as overly ambitious," he later suggests that schools should set incredibly ambitious goals like "in the second grade, everyone can count to 100," and "in the fourth grade, everyone can name the 10 most important countries (as rated by Google)..." I'm trying not to laugh.   The notion that we can fix everything in this country if we could just revert back to the way things used to be is incredibly unrealistic, hinders progress, and just needs to stop. It's my opinion that printing baseless rants like Price’s, disguised as an educated opinion by someone in the know, does more harm than good. It is, I would bet, a widely held opinion among your readership that their taxes are too high. And much of their anger over these taxes is unjustly vented at our schools. Although I think Mr. Price would claim his criticism is aimed at federal education officials (which I could get behind, if not just to say failure is unacceptable), comments like "spending nearly $700 billion a year" and "...the schools are as beautiful and expensive as ever before in history" would say otherwise.  Are state and local taxes not the primary source of education funding? So this is partially a veiled attack on public schools and the teachers who work in them and does nothing more than add fuel to the fire of misperception and resentment at the local level.  Not good. Liberal or conservative, a well written opinion piece is a pleasure to read and can stir productive debate. This one failed miserably.  Ed Harty Westminster, VT Return to top Login to post comments Click here for digital edition Tweets by eagletimesnh Copyright 2011-2017 Eagle Times, All Rights Reserved Newspaper web site content management software and services

In 1970, “fancy food” is what we called it when my father got a gift basket from his boss full of special jams, cheeses that weren’t Kraft Singles, and chocolates that were not from Hershey. That basket thrilled me. (The cheeses were still processed ones, but it was 1970 and for them not to have been, we would have had to be Italian-American or a different income level.) The words artisanal and upscale and that strange new term “noms” had not yet been applied to food, but I would get a feeling of world-shaking satisfaction whenever I’d go to the Jewish “appetizing” store on Avenue J, where there were preternaturally bright dried fruits and smoked fish that magically smelled delightful, not off-putting. Hence “fancy,” special. We seldom could buy anything there, but seeing it was enough. So it was with a sense of being in a childhood paradise that I found myself at the Summer Fancy Food Show last week, the national trade show for the Specialty Food Association, the 64-year-old association of producers and purveyors who sell “high perceived value” food to the American market. MORSELS: A summertime peek at what’s new and, in some cases, amazing In booths throughout the mammoth Jacob Javits Convention Center, there were literally thousands of entrepreneurs proffering samples of soft elite French cheeses, Wagyu beef from Japan, blood orange juice from Italy. Miles of pickles and goat ice cream and quince paste, an overwhelming largess of “special” crackers and snacks and cookies, so many proffered fancy chocolates I literally could not stand to see another one. (Really!) Eight-year-old me would have run naked through the convention center snatching up foods into my mouth, but 52-year-old me tried to go for the healthy stuff. That meant the meats and cheeses, dried fruit, smoked and cooked fish, and fermented pickles and sauerkraut. There are no fresh fruits or vegetables in the Fancy Food Show, and despite labels of “non-GMO,” “gluten-free,” “high-protein,” “superfood,” and “natural” slapped on everything, there seemed to be many more processed foods than whole ones. Foodie culture has had such an enormous influence on our eating habits that Specialty Food Association delights often turn into what are ever-after considered plain-old normal foods stocked in every supermarket: Chobani, Roland canned vegetables and sauces, Jelly Belly beans, and Season sardines are all members. So are the companies that make the seaweed snacks, kale chips, Barilla pasta, and coconut water you can now find all over New York. And you could (if you wanted to) sample all those now ho-hum products at the food fair. But like capitalism (and often, our appetites), the Fancy Food Show is focused on the new and different. Here are the five items from the show that made my toes curl: The food that excited me most was something called Bio-Revival “Burst Active,” which, embarrassingly, was… not exactly a whole food. Well, maybe. Sort of. I loved it. Bio-Revival, a company in Jupiter, Florida, uses molecular gastronomy to create bright, glorious “fruit caviar” pearls out of (variously) fruit juices, honey, olive oil, and balsamic vinegar. My favorite were the blackcurrant-juice pearls, which looked like large rubies and burst under my tongue. They were delicious. I wanted to give them to my guests at parties: they were beautiful, gleaming spheres of juice encapsulated in a ultrathin, taste-free layer of seaweed. (The molecular gastronomy process is called “spherification.”) I wanted to hand a spoonful to my best friend. The strawberry-juice caviar was also superb. (Bio-Revival also makes these jewels out of pomegranate, orange, and apple juice, though I didn’t get to taste these flavors.) The honey, balsamic, and even the olive oil spheres tasted exquisite, and they were some of the most beautiful-looking foods I have ever eaten. I would have liked to put all but the olive oil caviar in my cereal, or on pancakes. (The company recommends the olive oil and balsamic ones for use in salads, where they will not soak or wilt the greens.) Pricing on Bio-Revival’s website is utterly confusing, but company vice president Eugene Richter informs me that in contradistinction to the prices listed on the website, all products are now available for the promotional price of $12 for 113 grams, which I think is reasonable considering that these pearls can, as Bio-Revival’s brochure says, “surprise your family and party guests with innovation and fantasy.” They are all preservative- and GMO-free. “Pearls” can be ordered with or without sugar, although the tasty ones I tried all turned out to have come with. (I suggest calling or emailing Bio-Revival to order, rather than using the problematic website cart.) Cleveland Kraut’s Gnar Gnar. | CLEVELANDKRAUT.COM My second favorite product was something called CocoRau, subtitled “Raw Couture Collection.” Frankly, I am also faintly embarrassed by this choice. Not because it’s a line of raw chocolate truffles, but because a) they are tiny, one-ounce candies that retail for $6 a piece, and b) their maker, Konstanze Zeller, is a makeup artist who says she created the candies for “models,” intended as “beautifying” agents for their skin, with “antiaging nutrients that are good for your whole being.” The four flavors of “Raw Power Bites” have names that come from yoga and Hindu philosophy, and they are all made with raw, organic ingredients like cacao paste, pistachios, coconut oil, and molasses. Except for the green matcha-flavored one, which has some honey, they are all vegan. The thing is — they are the most exciting chocolates I have eaten in years. I tried two, the “SAMADHI — orange bliss — desire” and the “TURIYA — espresso — energizing.” Samadhi is defined (according to Google Definitions, at least) as “the stage at which union with the divine is reached (before or at death).” Sounds like desire to me. It truly tasted like desire, too — the orange essence and Mexican chile powder combine with the raw cacao and almonds and hazelnut pieces to provide a truly sexy, genuinely beautiful bite. Zeller also says she designed the chocolates to look “attractive,” and they do — surprisingly, that makes a huge difference. Turiya, according to various websites which may or may not have any authority whatsoever, means “pure consciousness,” “the serene and blessed state,” “the highest Brahmic consciousness.” I find it mildly hilarious (but not off-putting) that this is the yogic state Zeller decided to associate with espresso. But the chocolate, which I tried three times, is astounding. It did taste like it was giving me pure consciousness (in ways that just slurping espresso would not have). The almond flour and cacao and molasses (which is, in fact, loaded with great nutrients) actually did make the bite feel nourishing. Eating this caffeinated, healthy-tasting, delicious thing, I was willing to suspend disbelief and think for a minute that this bite might be anti-aging me. It’s too expensive for a regular treat, so buy it for someone you care about for the holidays. My third favorite (also not a health food): Les Trois Petites Cochons’ new Terrine Des Trois Rois, a sort of meat spumoni made of alternating layers of Armagnac-marinated prunes, chicken, and duck foie gras. For some of you, this will be an ethical horror as well as a cholesterol- and fat-bomb. But for me, it was like eating a wonderfully basso-profundo jam that somehow blended aptly with the butchest chopped liver you could find. It retails for about $18.99 online for seven ounces (which is a lot even for foie gras, but more than you can eat at several sittings, and more than enough for a dinner party). Fourth favorite: a new Italian blue cheese covered in coffee — yes, coffee — and slices of coffee beans, from the Italian cheesemakers Luigi Guffanti, called Erborinato Sancalone Caffè. This lovely, almost dessert-like cheese — the coffee tasted at some points like chocolate, but the blue cheese itself was not sweet — was exhibited by an American cheese distributor out of Armonk called World’s Best Cheeses, which had an enormous booth full of little-known cheeses that were nearly all wonderful. Fifth favorite: finally, a healthy one. Cleveland Kraut, a newish maker of great live, fermented sauerkrauts, has a fantastic new flavor out called Gnar Gnar. Most of the sauerkraut you’ll find at the grocery is shelf-stable and made with vinegar; Cleveland Kraut’s kind, fermented and probiotic, is far superior both nutritionally and in taste. Gnar Gnar, made with jalapenos, sriracha, green peppers, garlic, and leeks as well as cabbage, tastes both spicy and extra-fermented; a funky sauerkraut that you would be proud to have represent you in the world. The straight-seeming young men who make it, whom I met at the show, say that queer fermentation revivalist Sandor Katz is their hero. Random other things I liked: Malai, a line of delicate ice creams in Indian flavors like rose and star anise, made in Brooklyn. Brewla, a popsicle made of cold brew, awesome and also from Brooklyn. A line of dried fruits called Fruit Bliss — also made in the borough of my birth — that are the most luscious, juicy, fresh-tasting dried apricots, prunes, and Turkish figs I have ever tasted, and all organic. (They get a steam bath at some point to keep the fruit “wet,” yet are not slimy like some other “wet” dried fruit.) Another line of organic dried fruit called Made in Nature that makes the fruit into something called “supersnacks” I would normally disdain, except that these are both healthy and addictive (their Figgy Pops, “energy balls” made of figs plus things like coconut, nuts, seeds, cherries, and chocolate, made me happy). An odd thing called Coffee Blocks, coffee made with grass-fed butter, egg yolks, and coconut oil, is something I hope this culture adopts. 5 Responses to Getting Fancy Konstanze Zeller July 9, 2016 at 12:13 pm Thank you Gay City what a great written article:) and thank you for the amazing review on our product CocoRau.

Rumours of the next or the upcoming iPhone (iPhone 8) had begun to surface, but there was a bit of a confusion, because there were so many of them along with analysts hinting at some unbelievable stuff (coming from Apple). Which is when eventually we had a bit of a Eureka moment when Ming-Chi Kuo from KGI Securities predicted that Apple was expected to bring in a smartphone with a all-glass design to the game. Hinting that those leaked patents of an iPhone with a wrap around display would only arrive by 2018. Turns out there were rumours not just about the iPhone 8 but the iPhone 9 as well. As far as the latest iPhone 8 rumours go, its does not seem that exciting. While leaked patents have popped up from time to time, they are not as inspiring as the ones we have recently seen from Samsung with new form factors (the Galaxy X1). So with a curved OLED display, a sandwiched glass design with a forged steel chassis in the middle, and an ultrasonic fingerprint reader, will it be enough for Apple to stay on top of the premium smartphone market? This time around we asked the analyst Kiranjeet Kaur, Research Manager, Client Devices, IDC Asia/Pacific for her opinion and she had plenty to comment on. Samsung has been using smartphones with Super AMOLED displays for long. In fact, if the rumours turn out to be true Samsung along with LG would be launching a couple of smartphones with folding OLED displays as well. So why is Apple so late to the game? “Unlike other smartphone vendors who have a limited number of flagship phones supporting top-end specs, iPhones have the limitation or advantage that the specs in its two models (regular and phablet) are largely the same.” said Kaur hinting that Apple unlike other manufacturers produces only premium smartphones. “This means that Apple would need to secure a fairly large supply of OLED displays if and when it decides to bring an OLED display to the iPhone. So obviously Apple would need to wait till it is able to obtain the required number of OLED screens from its suppliers.” She commented that Apple already a formula like nobody else, “Apple has always tried to stay clear of hardware comparisons and has often not been the first one to launch a particular tech/feature. Rather it strives or so it seems to be more focused on the user experience of it. ” “It is not just the specific feature but rather the use case which becomes the defining factor. An example would be the curved screen in some of the Samsung ‘edge’ phones, which did create some hype for the Samsung phones and also helped drive some sales, but didn’t really create any significant use case for the consumer.” But Apple still lags behind when it comes to some features like quick charging, wireless charging and more that we could see in the upcoming iPhone. Wireless charging becomes more evident when you consider that Apple decided to go with a glass back this year instead of a metal one that simply did not make it possible since the iPhone 5. We could see Apple playing catch up with the Android realm in 2017 indeed. But then there’s virtual reality a feature that is expected to make some waves this year because Google decided to officially bring it to mobile with Daydream. So will Apple need AR to step ahead of the game this year? The IDC reasearcher gave a good reason why Apple would not leapfrog into this one. “While Apple’s entry into AR/VR space would signal its leadership in the smartphone industry, where it is currently lagging behind some of its competitors is AI. Making Siri smarter and getting it to redefine the way we interact with our iPhone and all an iPhone can do at a mere command, should set Apple in the front seat.” An iPhone 7 Plus with a zoom lens at the back was not exact a step ahead in image quality, but it good enough to be used frequently. But with Apple who has gradually turned from innovator to follower, 10 years is very long shelf life for the iPhone and the cracks have begun to show. The design of the iPhone has not changed in the past three iterations and while many do not have issues with it, it is getting a bit stale coming from a trendsetter. So I asked Kiranjeet whether Apple could be looking at moulding a new product like it did with the iPod (into an iPhone) back in 2007. The IDC research manager who examines competitive trends and studies end user trends had something really interesting to comment on, “I think there is still a lot of scope on what we can do with the smartphones, think about its use as a personal assistant, or the AR/VR capabilities and respective use cases. We could look at standalone devices for these but I see a lot of potential if the smartphones (or an iPhone in this case) could bring some of these capabilities in the phone itself.” Apple’s iPhone this year, may turn out to be the most polished piece of hardware it has every produced. It could have Siri to control and do everything and even do AR as CEO, Tim Cook as been hinting. It will stay the same iPhone, with the same set of icons and badges. However, Apple with a few tweaks may simply aim at changing the way we use it and as Apple has proved time and again, it just may be enough to take it to the top.

Performances will begin in Two River's Marion Huber Theater, 21 Bridge Avenue, tonight, January 14, and continue through Sunday, February 12. The opening night performance is Friday, January 27 at 8pm. Tickets are available from 732.345.1400 or tworivertheater.org. In Hurricane Diane, Madeleine George turns the Greek god Dionysus into Diane (Becca Blackwell), a lesbian separatist permaculture gardener from Vermont whose mission is restoring the Earth to its natural state-and gathering acolytes. Where better to begin than a tidy suburban cul-de-sac in Red Bank, New Jersey, populated by four women: Sandy (Mia Barron), Renee (Nikiya Mathis), Pam (Danielle Skraastad) and Beth (Kate Wetherhead)? As Diane Changes their yards into a wild wonderland of paw-paw trees and chokeberry bushes, she sets out to draw the women into her ultimate plan: to stage a bacchanal in her forest garden, and usher in a new era of Dionysian worship in the dying days of the American empire, as the planet warms and the oceans rise. "Red Bank is a coastal community, and climate change is as much an issue on the Jersey Shore as anywhere," says George, who wrote Hurricane Diane as a commission for Two River Theater. "I was eager to write a play that both rolls out a welcome mat in front of the theater, inviting people in and making jokes that specifically enfranchise them, and also offers people the chance to interrogate their own feelings about these climatic shifts that are happening whether we're ready for them or not." Madeleine George is the Pulitzer Prize-nominated author of The (curious case of the) Watson Intelligence. Her other plays include Seven Homeless Mammoths Wander New England, which had its world premiere at Two River in 2011. She is currently Two River's first Playwright-in Residence, funded through The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation's National Playwrights Residency Program (NPRP). Leigh Silverman, a two-time Obie Award-winner, most recently directed Sweet Charity starring Sutton Foster for The New Group. She earned a Tony Award nomination for her production of Violet. She directed Ethan Lipton's No Place to Go at Two River in 2012. Choreographer Sonya Tayeh has garnered acclaim for her work in the worlds of dance and theater, including two Emmy nominations for So You Think You Can Dance (2015 and 2013) and the 2014 Lucille Lortel Award and an Obie Award for her work on David Henry Hwang's dance-play Kung Fu. American folk/rock duo The Bengsons have performed their music worldwide. Their recent credits include you'll still call me by name (New York Live Arts), Hundred Days (Under the Radar Festival), and So You Think You Can Dance (2012-2015). The creative team for Hurricane Diane includes music director Matthew Dean Marsh, scenic designer Rachel Hauck, costume designer Kaye Voyce, lighting designer Jen Schriever, and Sound Designer Bray Poor. The stage manager is Melanie J. Lisby. Ticket prices range from $50 to $70, with discounts available for groups, seniors, and U.S. military personnel, their families, and veterans.

That’s the one which you want to know about, and ideally, you’re looking for the green tick at the end of it. 3. Deseat.me (Web): Scan Gmail, Find Everything You Signed Up For Over the years, you’ve probably used your Gmail account to sign up for several services. Whether you used the power of Gmail aliases Divide & Conquer Your Email With The Power of Gmail Aliases Divide & Conquer Your Email With The Power of Gmail Aliases When it comes to email organization, the immediate reaction is often all about folders, tags, filters, priority marks, and things of that sort.

It reads your emails, yes, but your privacy is guaranteed by working entirely offline. The app does not send any data to its servers. So run it once, let it find everywhere you have registered, and then start visiting those sites to delete the accounts you no longer use. 4. Privacy Badger 2.0 (Chrome, Firefox): The EFF’s Privacy Protecting Extension Websites are always tracking you. On any page you go, even something as small as Facebook and Twitter’s social sharing buttons are tracking you How To Block Facebook And Other Social Networks From Tracking You Online How To Block Facebook And Other Social Networks From Tracking You Online Whenever you visit a site with a Like, Tweet or +1 button, you're actually sharing data with Facebook, Twitter or Google.

Still, better safe than sorry, eh? 5. Passlock (Web, Chrome, Android, iOS): Easy Email Encryption for Everyone You already know that sending sensitive data on emails is risky. You never know who might be snooping. The ideal solution is to encrypt your emails, but it’s a messy process. Passlock makes it simple. In a nutshell, Passlock is a client for the Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) standard PGP Me: Pretty Good Privacy Explained PGP Me: Pretty Good Privacy Explained Read More . The app creates a “lock” and a “key” for you. You can send your lock to others. Others can apply your lock to any email they want to send you. This way, since only you have the key, only you’ll be able to open the lock and read the email. Even if someone else intercepts the email, they can’t open it since they don’t have the key. Passlock works on smartphones as well as with email, including Gmail. It’s extremely easy to use, and it is built by a security professor to boot. What’s Your Privacy Fear? Privacy is an area of increasing concern in the internet age. From what we share on social networks to what we share privately, so much of our personal data is online. And it’s difficult to control who sees it. In terms of leaks, there are three broad routes. Which do you fear most? Do you fear your data being in the hands of independent hackers, of large corporations, or of government or state bodies?

Tags job interview Career Business "She brought her boyfriend along" - S'pore employers on memorable interviews, and what makes them tick Vulcan Post | Melissa Chan | Friday, Jan 13, 2017 Photo: Vulcan Post Melissa Chan Vulcan Post Friday, Jan 13, 2017 Interviews are intimidating. I know, I've been through a fair share of them myself, albeit having joined the workforce just close to 3 years ago. Regardless of industry and work culture, interviews are often a nerve-wrecking process, many times leaving you with devastating regrets of not saying more, or not making the best impression. To make things worse, interviewers tend to throw candidates curveball questions, but these are usually more with the intention of seeing how he or she thinks on their feet, and less about them getting the 'right' answer. But unless we've been on the other side of the table ourselves, it's hard to pinpoint what actually stands out during an interview. Personally, I've learnt more about how to (potentially) ace an interview in a single session as an interviewer, as compared to the handful of experiences I've had stumbling over my words as a candidate! But of course, my experience is nothing compared to those with a good number of years conducting interviews, so I decided to reach out to a few employers, and find out more about how you could ace your next interview. Anna Chang, 45, VP - GM, Retail What are your general impressions of all the candidates you've interviewed so far? Most Singaporean candidates don't express and present themselves that well…those with overseas exposure tend to be more impressive when it come to communication skills and 'selling' themselves. In general, local candidates are very passive, failing to see that an interview is an opportunity for both sides to find out more about each other. For the employer, if the candidate is suitable and whether there is team fit, and for the candidate, to find out if the company culture and job are right for him or her. But many candidates approach it as a one-way process, thinking that it's mostly for the employers to ask questions. Oh, and many turn up unprepared! If you are not interested enough in the company or the job, why should I give you a chance? And first and second jobbers tend to be stumped when you ask them open ended questions like, "Tell me about yourself" or "What is the one thing you'll change if you're boss" - it's not that hard you know, this interview thing. What's one of the most memorable interviews to you? Memorable interviews? Nothing comes to mind leh… What makes a candidate stand out to you in a positive way? Interview: When the candidate is comfortable in his or her own skin, and when candidate slips in that she has done research, and knows to ask questions that are related and specific to the company and role she's applying at. Resume: Give me something that doesn't look like it came from the same cookie cutter! For a first jobber there isn't much work experience to look at, so can you imagine how dry and boring some resumes can be?! Like honestly, how important is it really for me to know how many As, or how well you read haha! So candidates have to think more from the interviewer's POV rather than own. If they were hiring, what would THEY want to see? So for first jobbers, giving info that can help their chances of being noticed or hired can be useful. Tell me what you do in your free time, what keeps the fire in your belly going…tell me how you want to impact the world, whatever. Or even whether you've mentored juniors, or volunteered at some event. Or even picking up a new skill or language outside of school! A pet peeve is when the candidate asks about nothing else but pay, AL and staff discounts at first interview! But not knowing much about the company or role supersedes that though. Disinterest in the company and role is the quickest way to turn me off in an interview. Any tips for job seekers on how to ace their interviews and spruce up their resumes? Basically the usual stuff like be yourself - don't be so nervous that your personality doesn't show up, and demonstrating that you've done your homework and know something about the company you're applying a job with. At the end of the day, every employer only needs to find out these: 1. Do you have the skills and experience for the job?; 2. If not, would you have the aptitude?; 3. Is there a good fit, company and team wise?; 4. Your attitude So no matter how employers phrase the questions, candidates only need to prepare for these and just answer…Or 'manipulate' the session a little and make sure these points are addressed. And remember this - employers see many candidates, make sure you stand out! If you're bland and boring, then very forgettable lor. So be energetic, be interested and be yourself! Azman, 55, Deputy CIO, IT What are your general impressions of all the candidates you've interviewed so far? Gap in experience between what they want to do, and what they have actually done. Pretty high energy and positive attitude in general, but the expectation of remunerations is too high. What's one of the most memorable interviews to you? Jialat: Someone picked up the phone and talking on the phone in front of a panel interview. Good: When candidates are relaxed, and it feels more like a conversation than an interview. What makes a candidate stand out to you in a positive way? Achievements. Other than describing what he has done, more valuable is what he/she has achieved - how they have brought value to a project. Any tips for job seekers on how to ace their interviews and spruce up their resumes? Go to the interview with a feeling that this is the only job you are going for, and you are the best candidate for the job - do your homework (about the company and the job), familiarise yourself about the industry. Jacky, 28, Director, Media and Communications What are your general impressions of all the candidates you've interviewed so far? Strong candidates are hard to come by. Most people don't know what they want and are just trying their luck. So it will be quite easy to see and sense when a strong candidate comes by, and usually those are the ones that we want to work with. What's one of the most memorable interviews to you? Nothing out of the blue so far. All have been very safe, and it's understandably so. What makes a candidate stand out to you in a positive way? Interview: How you speak and how you answer the question. If there's something new that I can learn from a candidate, that would be an instantaneous plus point. Resume: After looking through at resumes over the past 3 years, the only thing that matters is a neatly-presented and concise resume with the relevant experience. And of course, a decent photograph. Any tips for job seekers on how to ace their interviews and spruce up their resumes? Interviews: Please find out more about why you are applying for the job, and be honest about it. Resume: Please get a decent photograph with you smiling. Please quantify what you did for your previous job. That will help a lot. John, 58, VP - IT, Project Support Management What are your general impressions of all the candidates you've interviewed so far? In general, most candidates have either the experience or work-related knowledge of the position applied for. Most candidates will tell you they can perform this and that, but the real test is when they're in the first year after the probationary period. Choosing a candidate would require some intuition on the part of the interviewer. High EQ also plays an important part in making a good impression. What's one of the most memorable interviews to you? The most memorable interview to me was when a candidate had very high expectations of starting salary (as much as $3K above what the position offered). Reason being was that this candidate was retrenched, but was 'overpaid' by his previous employer. The history behind this was that his previous employer 'procured' experienced staff from my company and paid them a salary beyond market price. However, after less than a year in operations, said company began 'releasing employees' due to bad management decisions to overstaff their various departments. Hence, these 'retrenched' staff have very high expectations that other companies would pay them the similar pay for the same job. What makes a candidate stand out to you in a positive way? Qualities that make a candidate stand out among the rest are: 1) honesty to put forth his/her knowledge without exaggerating his/her potential  2) ability to grasp what is expected; 3) a good record in the resume with few movements between companies as it reflects that the candidate is willing to go through each phase in his career without giving up easily. Any tips for job seekers on how to ace their interviews and spruce up their resumes? There are many companies in the market that specialise in writing excellent resumes, but the bottom line is whether or not the candidate has the correct qualifications, relevant experience, and most importantly, whether or not he/she is open to engage with the interviewers in an intelligent and sincere manner. Be truthful and confident about yourself, but not overconfident because the tone and volume of your voice can betray you if you face a very experienced interviewer. Viviane, 31, Marketing and Communications Manager, Consumer Services What are your general impressions of all the candidates you've interviewed so far? Some context first - I interview candidates mostly in the range of 19yrs old to 30yrs old (interns to senior executive roles). I feel that it might have to do with Singapore's education system or the way we are brought up as Asians, but majority struck me as hardworking individuals, yet passive receivers of information, who lack curiosity and the hunger to find out more about what goes on around us. To me, it isn't an excuse because there's Google and people to ask. What's one of the most memorable interviews to you? I've a candidate who brought her boyfriend along for an interview. I wasn't sure who was going to sit for the interview when both of them entered the room. What makes a candidate stand out to you in a positive way? I think the people I have met so far who really made an impression on me were those who had a story of their own to share, which reflects development and a better understanding of themselves. In the consumer services industry (particularly hospitality and sports), I feel that candidates often need to be empathetic and have the ability to understand different perspectives as they put themselves in customers' shoes and envision the consumer journey that they will personally embark on. In the sports industry, we look at self-discipline and mental stamina that sports people are often associate with, because the factors that drive you to sports excellence and to improve in your fitness/sports are the same factors that will help you succeed at work. Any tips for job seekers on how to ace their interviews and spruce up their resumes? Resumes can show skills. My most basic advice is never to have a generic resume that you fire out to all recruiters and companies. Tailor each resume to the company you are applying to, so that you speak the same language and express the same belief as the organisation's vision. The way candidates structure and write their resumes often results in whether or not their resumes resonate with the hiring manager. Once a connection has been established (whether through your cover letter, your personality that shines through your experience), you gain an edge from the rest of the generic resumes out there. Stand Out…But In The Right Way While the ones I've gotten in touch with doesn't even come close to representing a significant number of employers in Singapore - there are a few common points that stand out. Be sincere, be realistic, and always understand the role and company you're applying for. What are some other tips that you adhere to in your own interviews? Let us know!

AI has already mastered chess and Go, but in poker everything is still to play for. “We’re so good at poker that not even a supercomputer can beat us,” says professional player Jason Les. “If we lose, we will also lose that prestige.” That could change this month. Les is one of four top Heads-Up No-Limit Texas Hold ‘Em players representing Team Human in the 2017 Brains Vs AI poker tournament at Rivers Casino in Pittsburgh. They are taking on a computer program called Libratus, developed by researchers at Carnegie Mellon University. An AI that can successfully beat poker professionals wouldn’t just claim another gaming victory over humans. It would also signal an ability to work with incomplete information – a skill that has a wide range of applications beyond just poker. The competition started on 11 January and runs for 20 days, with more than 120,000 hands being played to remove any element of chance from the results. AI underdog Ahead of the event, the odds were on the reigning human champions, who won the last competition against the AI in 2015. “International betting sites are considering the AI to be a 4:1 or 5:1 underdog,” says Tuomas Sandholm, one of the creators of Libratus. At the end of day two, however, Libratus was up by $150,126. It was winning against three players and losing against one. The AI has spent the equivalent of 15 million hours of computation honing its strategies, heading towards what game theorists call a Nash equilibrium: the point at which no further improvement is possible. Sandholm and his colleagues won’t reveal exactly how Libratus works, but they will say it hasn’t been fed any particular strategy. Instead, the AI must learn the best approach for itself. Poker is a difficult game for AI to conquer, and learning how to do so could help it develop other skills too. At any moment in a game, it can only see the cards it holds and those on the table, but not its opponent’s. An AI could simply calculate the odds that its hand is likely to win and play accordingly – similar to how AlphaGo, the AI created by Google’s DeepMind, beats top Go players – but knowing how to bet is less straightforward. If the AI bet high every time it had a good hand, a human opponent could easily figure this out and exploit it. The key for the AI is therefore not just working out how to play, but also figuring out how an opponent is playing. “Poker is an excellent game for testing artificial intelligence,” says Michael Bowling, head of the Computer Poker Research Group at the University of Alberta, Canada. “Unlike chess or Go, you never have a perfect view of the state of play, which is much more like reality.” Another artificial challenger Bowling is part of a team that claims to have created an AI that has beaten professional poker players. DeepStack uses a combination of machine learning and some strategic simplifications to make it possible to assess the best move in real time. The researchers say DeepStack came out on top after playing 44,000 hands of poker against 33 professionals. Their work has yet to be peer reviewed, but it would be an impressive feat if it stands up to scrutiny. Bowling and colleagues previously created a program to “solve” Heads-Up Limit poker, but Heads-Up No-Limit is a tougher challenge, as there is no restriction on the size of the bets. The number of different possibilities in a game of Heads-Up Limit is 1014, but in No-Limit it’s more like 10160. The heads-up variant of the game, which pits players one-on-one, may not be the most popular kind of poker, but it is best suited to AI competitions. “If there were more players, the humans would simply gang up against the AI, shifting the odds by a huge amount,” says Bowling. “No matter how sophisticated your AI was, it would still lose.” An AI that can excel at No-Limit poker could have applications in other tasks that require a strategy to be drawn up from incomplete information. This is the case in most real-world scenarios, such as when doctors must decide on people’s treatment without knowing everything about them. “It’s inevitable that AI will eventually win,” says Les. “That won’t be the end of poker, but it will be a massive milestone for AI.” More on these topics: artificial intelligence computing games Advertisement Download Buy In Print Subscribe Advertisement Sign up to our newsletter Enter your email address to get started Contact us FAQ About us Who’s who Advertise with us Advertise jobs with us Privacy and terms Write for us Science jobs Dating Shop RSS feeds Syndication information Events Travel The Collection Subscribe Account settings Gift subscriptions Student subscriptions Educational subscriptions Corporate subscriptions © Copyright Reed Business Information Ltd.

Some might scoff, but this is worth keeping an eye on. Brian Stoffel (TMFCheesehead) Jan 13, 2017 at 4:36PM To say that Veeva Systems (NYSE:VEEV) has performed well as a publicly traded company would be an understatement. While the stock itself is actually down since its post-IPO days, the company's fundamentals have vastly improved during that time frame. The cloud company that focuses almost exclusively on the pharmaceutical industry has seen its client list grow, while the number of offerings has exploded. All of this is helping to build a very strong moat. Image source: Getty Images. However, it doesn't mean that Veeva is immune to risks. Foremost among those risks right now are growing pains. These phases are normal as a company transitions from a start-up to a market leader, but it's a process that should prompt caution for investors. But first, you must understand the moat Veeva got its start when founder and CEO Peter Gassner was working at salesforce.com and noticed that pharmaceutical companies had very industry-specific cloud needs that couldn't be addressed by what Salesforce was offering. When he founded Veeva, a suite of customer relationship management (CRM) products became the bread and butter of the business. But since then, the company has spread its wings. The most important segment now is Veeva Vault, which helps companies bring a drug from the idea stage to market, while collecting all of the necessary data and complying by all of the necessary regulations, all from a single platform. As you might have guessed, such a convenient service ends up building an enviable moat around it in the form of high switching costs. If I run a drug company, and I have all of my employees trained -- and all of my data stored -- on a single platform, I don't even want to think about switching. Not only would that include a slowdown in work as a retrain my workforce, but it also creates operational headaches that just about no one wants to experience. That alone is a powerful reason to own the stock, and helps explain why it occupies over 3% of my real-life portfolio. The dark underbelly to high switching costs Here's the catch about building your moat around high switching costs: You have to defeat high switching costs to gain traction. By that, I simply mean that if Veeva wants to replace the entrenched systems in place at drug companies, it has to convince potential clients that the switchover is worth the time, money, and headaches that it will undoubtedly create. It accomplishes that task on two fronts: offering a superior product and having a stellar, committed sales force. Based on the number of awards the company has won and customers it has acquired, I'm not worried about the former. But after perusing a number of reviews on Glassdoor.com, I'm going to keep the latter on my radar. While Gassner's employees still give him high marks (an 85% approval rating), the overall distribution of company reviews has trended downward. Image source: Glassdoor.com. And the picture got a little bleaker when I looked at what employees said just during the past year. The breakdown of the reviews looked like this: Overall Rating CEO Approval Would Recommend to a Friend Positive Business Outlook 2.9 54% 45% 70% Data source: Glassdoor.com between Jan. 1, 2016, and Jan. 1, 2017. This doesn't paint the most flattering view of the company. To be sure, it's clear that these employees understand that Veeva has caught lightning in a bottle -- 70% have a positive outlook for the business, and 20% have a neutral outlook. Only 10% have a negative outlook. But there were some common threads among the complaints: a lack of work-life balance, a vague career track within the company, and a difficult time collaborating with others as a result of silos that exist in the company. The last point -- regarding collaboration -- is the most alarming, because the very best companies find a way to integrate the work of all employees toward a common goal. When silos form, it becomes very difficult for that to happen. And if it's happening now, change will be hard without serious rethinking of how the company does business. How I'm approaching this risk To be clear, none of the concerns raised in the reviews is enough to serve as a foundation for a solid buy or sell decision. While Glassdoor has its place as a data point in making decisions, it has shortcomings as well. My own personal takeaway is that the company is simply having growing pains. The world's largest and most successful companies are able to find ways to navigate the process of growing up. Alphabet's Google, for instance, has an average Glassdoor rating of 4.4, and Facebook clocks in with a 4.5. Veeva's traction in finding new customers, trends on Glassdoor, and spending on sales and marketing -- which increased 56% through the first nine months of last year -- will be the factors I monitor to gauge the situation. No company is without risks, and for the time being, I'm more than willing to accept these risks with my own investment.

Sweden's top diplomat wants to know Syrian selfie refugee sues Facebook for 'defamatory' posts Bangladeshi law proposes child marriage in "special cases" Mexican sex nightmare traps women fleeing for U.S. dream Kenya prepares to expand solar mini-grids into poorest rural areas PARIS, Jan 13 (Reuters) - Francois Fillon, the conservative politician seen by opinion polls as most likely to win the French presidential election this year, says France should sell state stakes in firms deemed as not having a strategic importance for the country. "The state should only be a shareholder in strategic companies," Fillon said in an interview with French magazine Capital. He declined in the published interview to name any individual companies to which this might apply. He also told Capital that France "must not show any signs of weakness" in terms of ensuring French technology companies could challenge bigger international rivals such as Google, Apple, Facebook and Amazon. Fillon's interview echoed similar comments last month, when he said he was favourable towards privatisations of state shareholdings in order to raise cash for investments in major infrastructure projects. Fillon, a former Prime Minister, said in December France should sell out of "unnecessary investments" in private-sector companies, citing carmaker Renault as an example. The French government holds just under 20 percent of Renault and has significant stakes in several other large companies including Air France, Airbus, Peugeot , Orange and Engie.

The will be teaching workshops throughout the weekend as well.  "It's really a crazy experience. You're meeting people who are working at Microsoft, Amazon. It really brings together a community of programmers, computer scientists who want to change the world," said Bob Chen, a participant.  Austin Mutschler, Hack Arizona Marketing Director, said participants have been recruited by the sponsors in years past.  "Last year our grand prize winner built a drone system that controlled a lot of drones at once. And he was able to receive a job at Raytheon for it. A lot of people get a lot of experience. A lot of people get recruited by a lot of corporations," Mutschler said.  Mutschler said the main goal of the weekend is for everyone to be able to learn through hands on experience. He said they focused on reaching out to all majors this year.  "It's like very big and there are so many companies out here. There's so many people and it's a really good way to exposure yourself to projects and things that you wouldn't imagine doing but have the opportunity to do," said Jaileen Salazar, a participant.  The judging will take place Sunday morning in the Student Union's Grand Ballroom. Inventions will be judged on originality, creativity, difficulty, and value proposition.  The public can take a look at the projects at 10 a.m.  For more information, visit Hack Arizona's website.  Copyright 2017 Tucson News Now.

Snap - in which Lynton is an early investor - is expected to go public early this year, vying for a $25 billion valuation. Lynton, who has been with Sony for 13 years, will stay on as co-CEO of Sony Entertainment for the next six months. He will also work with Sony Corporation's President and CEO Kazuo Hirai to find a replacement.  Hirai is expected to take on the additional title of Chairman and Co-CEO of Sony Entertainment during the transition.  'It has been an extraordinary 13 years and an honor to work at Sony with some of the most talented and creative people in the entertainment space,' Lynton said. In 2015, Lynton defended his response to the hack attack that leaked millions of documents and wiped out the company's network in 2014.   Lynton will join as chairman of Snap Inc, the parent of popular messaging app Snapchat effective on February 2, according to Sony Corp. The 57-year-old will join as chairman of Snap Inc, the parent of popular messaging app Snapchat, Sony Corp announced Friday In a wide-ranging interview with the AP, he explained how damaging the attack was and revealed that the Sony Pictures network is still not back online - more than six weeks after suspected North Korean hackers broke in. 'They came in the house, stole everything, then burned down the house,' he said on Thursday. 'They destroyed servers, computers, wiped them clean of all the data and took all the data.'

Share this article Share Lynton also said the picture house never really canceled the release of the 'The Interview' - the comedy film about the assassination of North Korea leader Kim Jong-un - amid hacker threats of terrorist attacks on movie theaters that screened it. Instead, he claims, the company was planning all along to find alternative ways to make sure audiences could see the controversial film. It was a call to Google co-founder Sergey Brin that helped the company decide to release The Interview online - a first for a big-budget film from a major studio. Lynton (left with Amy Pascal) said the picture house never really canceled the release of the 'The Interview' (right) - the comedy film about the assassination of North Korea leader Kim Jong-un - amid hacker threats of terrorist attacks on movie theaters that screened it Soon personal information for tens of thousands of current and former workers was dumped online. During the hack, former Sony boss Amy Pascal (pictured), 58, was targeted when a string of her private and damaging emails were leaked The network was crippled. Days before Thanksgiving, Sony Pictures employees had logged onto computers that flashed a grim message from a hacker group calling itself Guardians of Peace. Soon personal information for tens of thousands of current and former workers was dumped online, including Social Security numbers and the purported salaries of top executives. Five Sony-produced movies appeared on file-sharing websites. Thousands of private, and sometimes embarrassing, emails hit the Internet.

Elyse Betters14 January 2017Smartwatches Pocket-lint Facebook Twitter Pintrest LinkedIn Google+ Mail Comment LG is getting ready to unveil the LG G6 at Mobile World Congress next month, but it looks like that's not all we can expect from the company. An Android Wear device from LG recently passed through the US Federal Communications Commission, and according to images and details in the FCC documents, it appears to have round display and standalone LTE connectivity. Actual photos of the device are of course kept secret by the FCC, but we can still read between the lines and make a few educated guesses about the device itself. At least three different variants are being tested: LG-W280, LG-W280A, and LG-W280V. As DroidLife noted, these letters could correspond to the carriers they'll be available through (V for Verizon; A for AT&T; and Wi-Fi-only device). And the model number ZNFW280 indicates it will be a new LG Watch Urbane. If that's the case, it'll probably run Android Wear 2.0, which is set to roll out in early February. Screenshots of the Settings menu and the Personalisation option also indicate it is an Android Wear 2.0 watch. Keep in mind Google is now working on two flagship Android Wear 2.0 devices, which might launch at MWC 2017. It is not yet known which manufacturer has partnered with Google on the watches, rumoured to be codenamed Swordfish and Angelfish, so LG's watch could be one of the two. LG Watch Urbane review: All that glitters is not rose gold However, the most likely scenario is that this device will be the Watch Urbane 3rd Edition. Pocket-lint will be at MWC 2017 in Barcelona at the end of February to bring you all the latest as it happens, including hands-on reviews and analysis.

Photo: Reuters mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 8:20 AM, January 14, 2017 PARIS - Francois Fillon, the conservative politician seen by opinion polls as most likely to win the French presidential election this year, says France should sell state stakes in firms deemed as not having a strategic importance for the country. "The state should only be a shareholder in strategic companies," Fillon said in an interview with French magazine Capital. He declined in the published interview to name any individual companies to which this might apply. He also told Capital that France "must not show any signs of weakness" in terms of ensuring French technology companies could challenge bigger international rivals such as Google, Apple, Facebook and Amazon. Fillon's interview echoed similar comments last month, when he said he was favorable toward privatizations of state shareholdings in order to raise cash for investments in major infrastructure projects. Fillon, a former Prime Minister, said in December France should sell out of "unnecessary investments" in private-sector companies, citing carmaker Renault as an example. The French government holds just under 20 percent of Renault and has significant stakes in several other large companies including Air France, Airbus, Peugeot, Orange and Engie.

Skip to content Home News Sports Metro Plus Politics Business Entertainment Opinion Editorial Columnists Jobs Sections Featured Investors stranded as MMM reopens January 14, 2017January 14, 2017 Share Tweet Pin it +1 Dayo Oketola, Nonye Ben-Nwankwo, Gbenro Adeoye, Jesusegun Alagbe, Tunde Ajaja and Eric Dumo Mavrodi Mondial Moneybox, a Ponzi scheme known simply as MMM, on Friday opened for business after one month of break, but investors in the scheme have remained stranded as they still cannot access their funds. MMM had announced the resumption on its Twitter handle, saying it was “now open” even though it had initially promised to reopen today, Saturday, January 14. In the message, the scheme’s founder, Sergey Mavrodi, said because of the likely deluge of requests from participants, payments would be gradual and have limits. He also said it would prioritise payments to participants with small amounts, which were not specified, and that big investors would have to wait longer. “Please, be prepared to wait for a couple of days. We are certain things will then calm down, and the system operation will return to normal. “We’re the ones setting limits, so it’s completely under our control, and we are not expecting any emergencies in principle. Have no fear and go on about your business as usual. “As the system is socially oriented, we will make paybacks to the poor and the economically disadvantaged in the first place; it means to the members with small PH (Provide Help) amounts. The richer can wait. Moreover, we’ve warned you repeatedly to only provide help with amounts that are not critical for you.” With about three million Nigerians involved in the scheme and huge investments at stake, the freezing of the MMM’s accounts a month ago had sparked fears that the ponzi scheme had crashed. Meanwhile, some investors have expressed their frustrations as they might have to wait much longer to recover their much needed money from the scheme. Some of the participants told Saturday PUNCH that their funds that were tied down in MMM were meant for various uses including purchase of goods, payment of tuition, debts, rent and others. The fears and frustrations are further heightened by MMM’s declaration that it would introduce bitcoins as the new mode of payment ahead of its comeback, which some participants of the scheme have described as confusing. For example, Frank Bunna who deals in computer accessories at Olugbede market in Idimu, Lagos, said he was stranded as he had invested all the money for his goods in MMM. The Igbo trader, who was looking dejected when our correspondent visited the market, said his future was dashed as he expressed disappointment that he would not be able to get his money back today (Saturday). He said, “This is my life! How will I live? I invested N2m! Look at my shop, it is totally empty. I invested the whole money for my business on this MMM; I even borrowed N300, 000 that I added to it. I spent six days in the hospital as soon as I heard the account was frozen. I am hypertensive so my blood pressure shot up when I heard the news. To hear that I would not be paid immediately means that I am dead.” Another Lagos resident simply identified as Korede, who invested over N500, 000 in the scheme, said, “There is going to be crisis in my home. I borrowed my wife’s N300, 000 to invest in the scheme. I didn’t tell her, but I guess she’s suspicious now. “I promised to return the money December ending, but couldn’t. That was when MMM froze our accounts. It appears that there is going to be some delay before I can get the money. I just hope my wife will forgive me in case this thing fails. To be sincere, I am afraid.” An undergraduate of the University of Benin, Benin City, Edo State, who identified himself as Chiboy because he did not want his parents to know he invested his tuition and money meant for his dissertation in MMM, said he had been left stranded since December 2016, when MMM was suspended and desperately needed his money back. “I had thought that I would be able to get my money back immediately MMM reopened but from what I heard, it would not be possible. My mother will kill me. I don’t even know what to do,” he said. A teacher in a private secondary school in Egbeda, Lagos, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the bursar of the school had invested N1.5m belonging to the institution in the scheme before the scheme was suspended last month. According to the teacher, when the bursar could not provide the money, he was sacked by the school management and asked to sign an undertaking to return the money when MMM reopened on Saturday, January 14. “The bursar has since been arrested and in his undertaking, he had said he would get the money back immediately MMM resumed operations. But with this development, it will take some time before he can get paid, and that is if he gets paid at all,” the teacher said. A travel agent in Lagos, who identified himself as Mr. Oduntan, lamented that he has been going through difficulty after investing N900, 000 meant for paying his rent in MMM with the hope that he would get about N1.2m in return. Oduntan said he was desperate to recover his funds as his landlord had been on his neck since then. Also, a banker in a new generation bank in Ikeja, Lagos, told one of our correspondents on condition of anonymity that three of her colleagues were sacked for introducing some customers to MMM. According to the banker, his colleagues were sacked after the aggrieved customers officially complained to the bank manager that they were stranded because they had invested in MMM, which was introduced to them by some employees of the bank. The source said, “The customers said they needed their money back. They blamed some of my colleagues for introducing them to MMM and the bank had to sack them. “One of the customers complained that the money he had put in MMM was meant to roof his house and that his planned relocation to the house has had to be delayed because of that. Another one said the money he had invested in MMM was meant to pay his debts while another said the money was meant for his wife’s business.” Another banker working in a commercial bank in Akute, Ogun State, also said one of her colleagues was sacked for investing N2m he had loaned from the bank in MMM and was unable to pay back the loan. A barbing salon operator in Ilorin, Kwara State, Adejare Lawal, who spoke with one of our correspondents on Thursday, said he had invested money belonging to some of his colleagues, which was from their contributory scheme, in the investment. According to him, he invested around N350, 000 in November, hoping to get a profit of at least N80, 000 by the second week of December before accounts were frozen. “This is the biggest risk I have taken in my life and at the moment all I can think about is how to get the money back. I was the one coordinating the barbers’ association’s contribution in my area and I invested it in MMM.” In Oyo State, an estate agent, Mr. Funso Ogungbade, said he had invested the sum of N3.5m, part of which was from the rents he had collected from tenants on behalf of some landlords, in MMM. “My target was that by Saturday, everything would be sorted out but as it is now, I cannot get the money back soon. MMM is saying that it will start by paying the people with small funds and that it will also put a peg on how much we can get,” he said. A student at the Ladoke Akintola University of Technology, simply identified as Wole, said he had invested N50, 000 into the scheme a week before it froze all accounts. Another MMM investor, who simply identified himself as Olayinka, said, “I’m desperate to recover my money. All my investment has gone into it,” he added. Olayinka, who lost his job over a year ago, said he had invested N700,000 that was paid to him as entitlement in MMM, given how profitable the scheme was before it collapsed. He said, “I have been counting down since the day MMM announced the closure. Everything I had went into it so I am seriously stranded.” Another MMM investor, Miss Janet (surname withheld), said, “I lied to my brother to lend me money to pursue my Master’s programme. I’ve not been working for some time, and he was the one who advised me to go for a postgraduate degree. So, when I asked for money, he gave me N150, 000. “With the way it was booming, I invested my N600, 000 in it, including the money I had saved from my previous workplace. So, I’m in a fix as I’m talking to you.” Our students invested school fees in MMM –VC On January 11, 2017, the Vice-Chancellor of Osun State University, Prof. Labode Popoola, told journalists that the school’s authorities would publish in national newspapers names of students who owe tuition, claiming that some of them had invested the money in the MMM scheme. Noting that the affected students had owed since their enrolment, Popoola said it had come to the knowledge of the school that most of them were enrolled in MMM. He disclosed that the cumulative debt being owed the school by the students was N2bn. He said, “We are aware that parents of most defaulting students had given them their school fees and it was revealed that the students had diverted the monies into the MMM scheme.” Confusion mounts over bitcoin Findings by Saturday PUNCH showed that more Nigerians have been searching for information about bitcoin on the popular search engine- Google. For instance, between Thursday and Friday, search for “where to buy bitcoin in Nigeria” on Google Nigeria rose by 200 per cent, according to Google Trends. Search for “MMM bitcoin” rose by 150 per cent; “What is bitcoin all about?” rose by 160 per cent; while “meaning of bitcoin” rose by 60 per cent. One of the participants who spoke with Saturday PUNCH, Bunna, said he had no idea of what bitcoin meant and that the more he asked questions about it, the more confused he got. “I don’t know what bitcoin means. Don’t even bother explaining how it works to me because many people have tried and they left me more confused,” he said. “Once I get paid, I don’t even want to be part of any MMM again. God knows that nothing in this world will make me do this nonsense again. While other people were celebrating Christmas, I was in the hospital. Even now, I have yet to recover, so why do you think I would want to do this kind of thing again?” Wole, a LAUTECH student, said, “Another problem now is the introduction of bitcoin to the platform. I have yet to fully understand how it operates. I will read more about it so as to know how to go about withdrawing my money. I just hope the system wouldn’t crash.” Speaking about the bitcoin option recently introduced, Janet said, “Whether bitcoin or no bitcoin, I want my money, possibly today (Friday).” Chiboy said he had only heard of bitcoins and was not interested in “such things.” Olayinka said, “They wouldn’t dare introduce bitcoin at this time. But if they do, we are at their mercy. I just want my money back.” Copyright PUNCH.                All rights reserved.

IBM thinks that solution is Watson. Danny Vena (TMFLifeIsGood) Jan 13, 2017 at 7:06PM Cybercrime is an epidemic. Consider these statistics from Checkmarx: Cybercrime is expected to cost businesses over $2 trillion annually by 2019, four times as much as 2015. In the U.S., a breach costs a company an estimated $15.4 million on average. Some hacks can be resolved in days, while others can take weeks or months. These are more than mere statistics. Real-world examples abound. In December, Yahoo! revealed the largest known security breach to date, which compromised over 1 billion accounts, only months after it reported a separate breach involving 500 million users. These intrusions could take years to resolve and cost millions of dollars.  Cybercrime is an epidemic; IBM's Watson has your back. Image source: Pixabay. IBM (NYSE:IBM) is rolling out a new weapon in cyberdefense: its Jeopardy!-winning cognitive supercomputer Watson. So how will a game show contestant help prevent hacking? Glad you asked, but first, a little background. One of the technologies behind Watson is an artificial intelligence (AI) discipline known as deep learning. A software model of the brain is used to recreate our ability to learn. By using a massive number of examples, combined with sophisticated algorithms, the system learns to discover similarities among the examples and find differences. This results in the program mastering pattern recognition when reviewing large data sets. Teaching Watson about cybercrime IBM Watson is expanding its security protocol. Image source: Pixabay. IBM announced earlier this year that it was partnering with eight universities in a year-long research project to provide Watson with the requisite data necessary to expand its security protocol. These universities were chosen on the strength of their cybersecurity programs. According to an IBM press release in May, the system was "learning the nuances of security research findings and discovering patterns and evidence of cyberattacks and threats that could otherwise be missed." Students and faculty input security data while Watson learned the peculiarities specific to cybersecurity. It planned to process up to 15,000 documents per month, building its database of threat intelligence reports, cybercrime strategies, and threat databases.  And the work is paying off. IBM recently announced that 40 organizations are now part of the Watson Cyber Security beta program. This group hails from a wide array of industries including banking, healthcare, insurance, finance, travel, energy, automotive, and education.  IBM hopes that by increasing participation in the beta program, Watson will, over time, evolve into the next generation of cyberdefense. "By applying intelligent technologies like machine learning and natural language processing, Watson can help security analysts make better decisions from structured data, as well as the massive amount of unstructured data that has been dark to an organization's defenses until now," IBM wrote in its press release. Better detectives Mixing AI and cyber-security holds a lot of promise. MIT announced earlier this year that an AI system had achieved an 85% success rate at detecting threats. This system, called AI Squared, differed from previous attempts at using AI for cyberdefense.  Rather than simply referring all anomalies to its human counterparts, this experiment provided feedback from the analyst to the system, allowing it to learn from the input provided by its human counterparts.  This improved the system's assessments over time, increasing the accuracy of future predictions. This reduced the number of both false positives and false negatives, according to MIT. This is a quantum leap forward versus earlier outlier detection, which merely looks for anomalies that are then forwarded to a human technician for further assessment.  This video from MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory illustrates the process: Learning on their own Google neural networks created their own encryption! Image source: Pixabay IBM isn't the only player in this emerging field. While many big tech companies use varying degrees of artificial intelligence to help provide security for their cloud-computing operations, some are taking it to another level. In a research paper, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) division Google revealed that two neural networks had learned to build their own form of encryption, while a third was unable to crack that code. This is significant because they weren't taught about encryption or given any examples of encrypted and decrypted messages. Two neural networks were instructed to send communications to each other, and keep that information secret from the third. This is likely an early development toward a dynamic system that learns to protect itself. In its conclusion, the paper states: "Finally, neural networks may be useful not only for cryptographic protections but also for attacks." With its massive data centers and cloud infrastructure, this development could further enhance Google's business and advance its already impressive AI credentials. The Foolish final word IBM has been leveraging Watson in a variety of ways. In adding cybersecurity to its resume, IBM hopes to capitalize on the inability of companies to keep pace with the growing threat posed by cybercrime. Sandy Bird, chief technology officer of IBM Security was quoted as saying in a press release: Customers are in the early stages of implementing cognitive security technologies. Our research suggests this adoption will increase threefold over the next three years, as tools like Watson for Cyber Security mature and become pervasive in security operations centers. Currently, only seven percent of security professionals claim to be using cognitive solutions. If Watson can capture just a portion of that threefold increase, its training has not been in vain.

Tech rogue Peter Thiel thinks so, telling the New York Times this week that he believes "the age of Apple is over." "We know what a smartphone looks like and does," said the Facebook board member, PayPal co-founder, chess prodigy, and Trump transition team member. "It's not the fault of Tim Cook, but it's not an area where there will be any more innovation." Loyal fans agree, citing lackluster "improvements," a lack of innovation, and a year that saw sales fall for the first time since 2001. As Apple celebrates the 10th anniversary of the iPhone, the company appears to have gone into "maintenance mode" while everyone waits for its next big thing to emerge — if ever. Ronan Timoney, a 23-year-old economics and finance student in Ireland, has had Apple laptops since 2010, iPhones since 2011 and an iPad since 2012. As a young, avid Apple user, he's exactly the kind of customer the company should be wooing for their long-term success. But his most recent smartphone purchase was an Android.

"Their products have become fashion accessories rather than high-powered gadgets, and prices now outstrip quality," said Timoney. He "will not be buying any Apple products for the foreseeable future," he said. 2016 was a particularly rotten year for Apple. Annual sales fell for the first time since it launched the iPod in 2001, going from a record $234 billion in 2015 to $216 billion. Its new lineup of MacBook Pros this year failed to impress. The best thing about the iPhone 7 is its camera. It also forced users to invest in $159 wireless AirPods, which had a delayed launch, or use an awkward dongle to use their old headphones. Not very "Appley." Core Products for 2017 And what's in store for 2017? Reportedly three new faster iPad models in different sizes as the company tries to fend off other touch-screen phones and computers, but iPad units have declined in 10 of the last 11 quarters. Instead of "thinking different" the company is "thinking slightly better." To be sure, "Apple is a great American success story," but, "a lot of that innovation came from the Steve Jobs era," said Colin Gillis, an analyst at BGC Partners known for his bearish views on the company. CEO Tim Cook is an efficient caretaker but doesn't necessarily have the late Steve Jobs' "founder's fire" that can propel a company past the threshold of what was thought to be possible, said Gillis. "Amazon, Google, Tesla, Netflix, Facebook, what do they have in common? They're all still driven by their founders. They're still able to make big bets and change directions. Is Apple positioned for the next thing?" asked Gillis. Related: Apple's Poor Performance Takes a Bite out of Tim Cook's Salary That's the big question as longtime users and investors wait to see where the company's $2 billion annual increase in research and development has been going and on what acronym it might it plant a flag next. AR? IOT? VR? AI? "What you're seeing is a point where Apple is making a slower transition away from being a company that historically came out with whizzbang products every couple of years to a company that makes great products we all need," said Gene Munster, the co-founder of Loup Ventures, who previously covered Apple as a Piper Jaffray analyst for over a decade and remains bullish. "As they shift resources, you get what happened in 2016: Not that exciting of a product year." Who's Driving Innovation? He thinks the next big things for Apple will be whatever it decides to do in the car space, artificial intelligence, and, according to the kind of Apple rumors that used to capture fanboys' and pundits' imaginations, a foldable phone with bendable glass. But it won't be Apple making the device, countered Gillis. "They're not driving the innovation... Samsung will be the ones who make it." Even hardcore Apple users say they've noticed a change. Apple is becoming more like Microsoft, a former wunderkind that became large, profitable, boring, and angered pro users. Is Microsoft the New Apple? As a Mac user, I.T. manager Dan Fox is used to standing out at his PC-filled office at an Orlando-based engineering firm. "Apple made these gorgeous, sleek, shiny devices that looked like they were from the future," he told NBC News. "They were cooler than anything else on the market and, more importantly, they actually worked better," said the 45-year-old Fox. His family members are all Apple fans too, and their house is full of MacBooks, Apple Watches, iPads, iPhones, Apple TVs, and he even sprang for the AirPods. As of late though, the "cutting edge" upgrades to the Surface and Office 365 have him considering that Microsoft might be becoming the new Apple, with well-built and innovative products, he says, that show an attention to details. He still loves Apple, but says he feels "Improvements are iterative, and it's almost as though Apple is now relying on its brand more than its tech. It feels like they are stalling on innovation to squeeze one more model out with a tiny upgrade. Rinse. Repeat. Things are starting to feel… stale."

Follow TechnoBuffalo Andy Rubin, one of the minds behind Android, is ready to burst back onto the scene with a lineup of smart devices, including a mobile device “that lacks a surrounding bezel.” According to Bloomberg, Rubin and his 40-person team are working on a suite of consumer hardware products, one of which will be a high-end smartphone to compete with the iPhone and Pixel. Rubin is said to have discussed the device with mobile carrier executives earlier this month, the report says. “It’s expected to include high-end materials and the ability to gain new features over time,” according to the Bloomberg report. One prototype reportedly being tested by Rubin’s company, dubbed Essential, sports a display in the 5.5-inch range, with a footprint that’s significantly smaller than Apple’s iPhone 7 Plus. Rubin was able to achieve this by cutting down on the bezels. The alleged phone also sports a pressure-sensitive screen and metal edges. The back is said to be made of ceramic, a material that’s difficult to manufacturer, people familiar with Essential’s plans said. “Essential’s engineers are developing a proprietary connector that serves double duty for charging the battery and expanding the phone’s functionality over time,” Bloomberg said. “The magnetic connector would allow Essential or even third parties to create hardware accessories that add features to the smartphone.” It’s sounds a lot like the Moto Z Rubin apparently has a lot of talent on his team, including former Google and Apple engineers. It’s unclear whether or not the device will run Android though the project is said to feature Rebecca Zavin, a former senior Google software manager. The device sounds a lot like a Moto Z, a device released toward the end of last year. Through the use of Mods, users could extend the abilities of the device—a key feature Rubin’s device will reportedly possess.

ENTERTAINMENT Silicon Valley ‘The Young Pope,’ ‘Twin Peaks’ and more ‘Star Wars’: 2017 Movie and Television Preview Jan. 13, 2017, 4:17 p.m. Each winter gives way to spring, to hope eternal, to new movies and TV shows to watch while ignoring the fresh flowers and summer breezes and changing foliage of the unforgiving outdoors. And looking at the upcoming season's release schedule, there’s no reason to think that 2017 won’t deliver wonders for our eyes and ears. From old favorites (HBO’s “Game of Thrones,” Universal’s “The Fate of the Furious”) to shiny new confections (Jordan Peele’s “Get Out,” the CW’s “Riverdale”), the year to come does what all new years do: dangle promise before us, daring us to reach for it. Here are the movies and television shows that the L.A. Times’ Calendar staff are most excited to see in 2017. We don’t know if any of them will be any good, but we can’t wait to find out. (Reminder: Release and premiere dates subject to change.) All updates Movies TV TV Premieres spring 2017 'Silicon Valley,' HBO Chris Barton Kumail Nanjiani, from left, T.J. Miller, Thomas Middleditch, Zach Woods and Martin Starr in "Silicon Valley." (Associated Press) It may struggle to escape the shadow of the dragon-sized dramas of schedule-mate “Game of Thrones” this year, but this series, co-created by Mike Judge, continues to offer sharp satire of the odd personalities and absurd economics of the tech industry.  Last season saw Richard’s (Thomas Middleditch) company Pied Piper spiral through various stages of assured success and disaster while trying to launch its platform. And its inability to be understood by non-engineers resulted in the company being nearly swallowed by the Google-esque Hooli before being rescued by Erlich Bachman (T.J. Miller) and Big Head (Josh Brener). For the fourth season, Pied Piper has pivoted to video thanks to an effort by Dinesh (Kumail Nanjiani) that holds some promising possibilities in the changing dynamics between the programmers, particularly with regard to the dryly amoral Gilfoyle (Martin Starr). Like the area it skewers, the show still tilts primarily male, and there’s a chance it could become even more so as Suzanne Cryer’s investment firm has pulled out, which would leave Amanda Crew’s Monica as the show’s biggest female character. However, now that she's working closer with Pied Piper than ever with last season’s finale, there’s still lots of potential for this start-up to pay off.

Incidentally, the French DJ could not perform in Mumbai as scheduled on Friday after Mumbai police refused to host the show. The ever-active Telangana government has made sure that no such last-minute glitches happen and it's eager to welcome the popular musician. The Cyberabad police, through a tweet, extended a warm welcome to Guetta and also rubbed it in, adding that they were committed to ensuring a glitch-free event. The Bengaluru police had officially claimed that the permission was cancelled for the Bengaluru concert as their personnel were deployed to ensure an incident-free Agriculture Produce Market Committee ( APMC) elections. But the event organisers had posted on social media that the permission was denied in wake of the recent mass molestation incidents on New Year's Eve in the city and other incidents of women being targeted in the city. "Welcome to Hyderabad @davidguetta.

The hybrid device - which goes on sale March 3 for US$299.99 (S$430) - comes as Nintendo also dips its toe into the mobile gaming market following its big brand win after Pokemon Go's worldwide success. At a Tokyo media briefing, the company said the console is packed full of Nintendo's "entertainment DNA", taking elements of earlier devices including the 3DS handheld and motion-sensor Wii. Switch got off to an inauspicious start in October when a sneak peak at the console left gamers and analysts underwhelmed and with many unanswered questions. Friday's launch is "a key turning point for Nintendo's earnings and share price", Daiwa Securities said before the event. But Nintendo's Tokyo-listed stock dived after it released a three-minute video about the product on YouTube. On Friday, its shares dropped 5.75 percent to 23,750 yen. Switch has a removable screen that lets players dock it at home and also use it on the go like a tablet computer with detachable controllers - called Joy-Con - on both sides. It uses cartridges rather than discs. The idea is to give users a more immersive experience with realistic physical sensations matched to what is happening on-screen, the firm said. A remote control feature means players don't always have to keep their eyes on screen while punching the air in a boxing game or getting into a gun duel. Only eight games will be available when the system goes on sale in March including a Legend of Zelda offering. But there are some 80 more games in the pipeline, Nintendo said. Similar briefings are being held in Paris, London, Frankfurt and New York later on Friday. Switch will be crucial for Nintendo, which needs a hit product to offset the flagging fortunes of the Wii U and 3DS, as rival Sony racks up huge sales of the PS4 - it has sold more than 50 million units globally since its debut in late 2013. In November, Sony started selling the US$400 PS4 Pro, which promises even sharper graphics than earlier versions. Switch underscores how Nintendo tends to look at gaming as fun play while Sony's big focus has been on visuals, said gaming specialist Hirokazu Hamamura. "It's a Nintendo-esque game console that shows how the company sees gaming as 'play' rather than image arts," Mr Hamamura told AFP at the event. After struggling to fix its weak finances, Nintendo abandoned a long-held consoles-only policy and decided to enter the smartphone game market. Last year, the Super Mario and Donkey Kong maker released Miitomo - a free-to-play and interactive game - as it tries to compete in an industry that has increasingly gone online. It scored another hit with the Pokemon Go app released in July, but the impact on Nintendo's profits will be limited. The company is the creator of the Pokemon franchise but does not own the licence for the game, which was developed and distributed by US-based Niantic, a spinoff of Google. Last month, Nintendo released the Super Mario Run game for iPhones, which topped download charts and drew more than 40 million downloads globally in the first four days after its release, according to the company. But analysts warned its popularity could be hampered by a relatively high US$10 price tag for access to the full game, since many online offerings are free.

Here are half a dozen wellness-enhancing steps we could all embrace: Talk about your worries We will all face challenges and low periods (no matter how glittering things look on social media). Rates of anxiety and depression have risen, some 70 million work days a year are lost to mental illness (including stress), according to the UK’s Mental Health Foundation, and suicide remains the biggest cause of death in men aged under 49 in the UK. In fact, men account for three-quarters of all suicide deaths, yet they’re still less likely to talk about their mental health or seek support than women. Whether it’s a chat with a friend, your GP, opening up to a stranger on a helpline (such as the Cyprus Samaritans on 8000 7773), or finding solace with people going through similar experiences on an internet forum – find the space that works for you and offload. Ditch diets We all know diets can be a vicious cycle, setting you up for mood swings and often greater weight gain – and, just recently, a US study found women who yo-yo dieted had a higher risk of sudden cardiac death and coronary heart diseases. Obviously, it’s not a good idea to dismiss healthy eating and pay no attention to your weight, but it doesn’t have to be complicated and punishing. Pay attention to guidelines (they are based on research!), eat like you care, enjoy the good stuff in moderation and relax. “You can guarantee that as soon as you ban a certain food, you will get cravings for it!” says Shona Wilkinson, nutritionist at SuperfoodUK.com. “It’s worth bearing in mind that most foods have some health benefits (except the processed, sugary types). You can, therefore, still have most foods, but save some for occasional treats. For example, it isn’t beneficial for health to eat red meat every day, but certainly the occasional steak with vegetables is great. By limiting your intake of a particular thing, rather than cutting it out, you can save yourself the torment of cravings. Eat sensibly, practice ‘mindful’ eating and you can’t go wrong.” Avoid the office cake trap Barely a week goes without a colleague slicing cake and offering it round. Unless you have willpower of steel it can be hard to resist (even when you don’t want the cake, you’d rather cram it down than cause offence), and it’s contributing to the world’s obesity epidemic and dental health issues. Cyprus is close to the EU average when it comes to obesity. 2014 Eurostat data put the average rate at 14.5%, compared to the EU’s 15.9%. Obesity in men in Cyprus is more widespread at 16.3%, with women approximately 3% lower at 12.9%. The faculty of dental surgery (FDS) at the Royal College of Surgeons in the UK is urging British employers to help tackle workplace ‘cake culture’. There’s nothing wrong with enjoying the occasional slice, but this is a very real example of how easy it can be to lose control of good intentions when you’re in a group, or your environment doesn’t support them. Chances are you’re not the only one in the office concerned about the repercussions of scoffing cake and biscuits on a daily basis, so why not make a pact with colleagues to bring in healthy snacks and limit treats? And nobody’s allowed to ask the dreaded, ‘Oh, are you on a diet?’ if somebody says no to a red velvet cupcake… Move your body If you haven’t already, make 2017 the year you fall in love with moving your body. It’s a solidly established fact that people who are regularly physically active have a significantly lower risk of major diseases like type 2 diabetes, many cancers and heart disease – and there’s a wealth of evidence that exercise supports mental health, too. Aside from that, it feels good to feel fit. You’re more awake, motivated, life’s more fun and manageable and you and your body are working together. Find the ‘thing’ that feels like a joy, rather than a chore – whether it’s country walks, dancing, skipping in the garden or ultra-marathons – and just do it. Do it for you, make it a habit and keep at it. Curate your social media Does browsing Facebook leave you on a bit of a downer? Battling FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) attacks, questioning why everyone else’s life looks better than yours? Or maybe it brings out a mean streak and you succumb to tutting and judging others’ over-sharing or bragging. Newsflash: You’re in the driving seat here. Nobody’s forcing you to look at Facebook or Instagram, or feel bad afterwards. If it’s impacting your self-esteem and moods, do something about it – ‘un-follow’, ‘hide’, or just have a break entirely, even if it’s just for a week. Social media should enhance your life, not zap the joy out of it – but that’s only going to happen if you take control of how you’re using and engaging with it. Don’t put off doctor‘s visits Hassle, waiting time, embarrassment about making a fuss or fearing the worst – there are tonnes of reasons we put off seeing the doctor (and statistics back up the cliché that men are worst for this). While, certain things – colds, flu and standard sickness bugs, primarily – don’t warrant a trip to the GP (you’ll just be wasting your time and spreading germs), if it’s worrying you, if you’re in pain, find any unusual lumps or bumps and especially if symptoms are worse or still there after a week, just make an appointment. Dr Martin Saweirs (drmartingp.com), who’s also a GP for the British medical helpline Dr Morton’s (drmortons.co.uk), is well aware some people have a habit of not going to the doctor. “The trouble is, what happens is they either don’t go for one or two little things, which then become bigger things and more difficult to deal with. Or they come along with their one little thing and they’re really embarrassed – but generally, anybody who comes to the doctor with anything they’re embarrassed about has such self-awareness that I can assure them there’s always someone with something far more embarrassing,” he stresses. A chat with the doc will help prevent you from falling down the Dr Google rabbit-hole of dread, too – whatever the symptoms, “one of the things that always comes up is cancer”, notes Saweirs. Although, if you do have something that could be cancer, getting it properly checked ASAP is always a good idea. Make ‘me time’ a rule Stress is the ‘modern plague’, and don’t we know it. Yes, we’re more privileged than ever before, but sensory overload, long working hours and always being ‘connected’ (thanks smartphones) is leaving us frazzled and on the brink of burn-out. So banish the guilt, and accept that ‘me time’, ‘down time’ – whatever you want to call it – is a necessity.

A Virtual Reality One PC Makers Need a Reality Check. A Virtual Reality One Jan 13, 2017 Tim Culpan | Bloomberg EMAIL Tweet Comments 1 Bloomberg Advertisement (Bloomberg Gadfly) -- Global PC shipments fell 5.7 percent last year because ... well, you know why: Fewer people want to buy a PC. It really is as simple as that. Analysts can slice and dice the numbers to try to explain every twist and turn in the industry's demise, but Occam's Razor applies. In its press release outlining the latest data, IDC clearly subscribed to the "flat is the new up" theory on market growth by noting that fourth-quarter unit sales fell only 1.5 percent. According to the research provider, the results "continued the recent trend of stabilizing growth." Something needs to be done. Consolidation among players isn't enough -- they tried that and it didn't stop the inexorable price declines that have always been a part of the electronics hardware business. So now it's time for something new. Like, say, producing a product people actually want to buy. Think about the last PC you logged in on. Now compare it to the PC you logged on to 15 years ago. See the difference? Nah, didn't think so. Not since Jony Ive decided that Bondi Blue was a good color for a computer have we seen any real innovation in PC design. The technology inside has barely changed either, merely evolving with faster and more powerful systems, which is thanks to the semiconductor industry, not the PC one. What PC companies need to do now is take the product they make -- little boxes of computing power -- and turn them toward practical applications consumers actually want. Virtual reality is the obvious one. VR is resource heavy and time sensitive, requiring both speed and power. But to date, the major VR players are producing headsets and relying on PC makers to fill that computing void. The exceptions here are Sony Corp., which has leveraged its headset-PlayStation combo to lead the market, and Acer Inc., which is focusing on commercial buyers. PC makers either need to do VR themselves, or buy an existing player. VR isn't the only arena. Home servers are another segment screaming out for a good supplier. This would essentially be a personal cloud server, storing photos and files, streaming content and acting as the hub for a coming wave of automated services. Instead of relying on the likes of Apple Inc. and Google Inc., a home solution would hand control back to consumers and make PC companies relevant again.  Acer has been trying to kick-start the idea with its Build Your Own Cloud initiative but has failed to gain traction. That shouldn't stop others from trying: A few firms took a crack at smartphones and tablets before Apple showed them how it's done. When analysts describe a declining market in positive terms, you know things are bad. And for PC makers, desperate times call for desperate measures. Print reprints Favorite EMAIL Tweet Discuss this Article 1 CSMR on Jan 13, 2017 "Think about the last PC you logged in on. Now compare it to the PC you logged on to 15 years ago. See the difference? Nah, didn't think so." My computer occupies 60x less volume than the one I had 15years ago. It also has gone from single core to 8 virtual cores, 30x as much RAM, an SSD which is completely new as well as an HDD. which is 100x as large. 15years ago hardly any monitors were LCDs. So I think I have seen tremendous improvements in desktop technology and design. However I don't upgrade as often as I used to, and I don't spend as much as I used to. Everything is so instant that I would hardly notice a 2x speed increase, despite using heavy software. Why are people writing so many web apps? Because people don't notice a 10x decrease in performance. The PC's importance is undiminished, and the situation for PC buyers is great. (Though agreed that there is not much we can do with the huge processing power we are offered.) For PC makers though, it looks grim.

Picture : Getty Images Nintendo on Friday unveiled its new Switch game console, which works both at home and on-the-go, as it looks to offset disappointing Wii U sales and go head to head with rival Sony’s hugely popular PlayStation 4. The hybrid device comes as Nintendo dips its toe into the mobile gaming market after scoring a big win for its brand in the summer with the success of Pokemon Go .The company said its new console was full of Nintendo’s “entertainment DNA” with elements of earlier devices including the 3DS handheld device and motion-senor Wii. Before the event, Daiwa Securities described the unveiling as “a key turning point for Nintendo’s earnings and share price”. But Switch got off to an inauspicious start in October when a sneak peak at the console left gamers and analysts underwhelmed and with many unanswered questions. Nintendo’s Tokyo-listed stock dived after it released a three-minute video about the product on its YouTube channel. The shares fell 2.24 percent to 24,635 yen Friday ahead of the media event in Tokyo where the company released more details, saying it will go on sale on March 3 for US$299.99 and 29,980 yen in Japan. A similar New York media event will follow later in the day. Switch has a removable screen that lets players dock it at home and also use it on the go like a tablet computer with detachable controllers on both sides. It uses cartridges rather than discs. PS4 showdown  Switch will be crucial for Nintendo, which needs a hit product to offset the flagging fortunes of the Wii U and 3DS, as rival Sony racks up huge sales of the PS4 — it has sold more than 50 million units globally since its debut in late 2013. In November, Sony started selling the $400 PS4 Pro, which promises even sharper graphics than earlier versions. After struggling to fix its weak finances, Nintendo abandoned a long-held consoles-only policy and decided to enter the smartphone game market. Last year, the Super Mario and Donkey Kong maker released “Miitomo” — a free-to-play and interactive game — as it tries to compete in an industry that has increasingly gone online. It scored another hit with the Pokemon Go app released in July, but the impact on Nintendo’s profits will be limited. The company is the creator of the Pokemon franchise but does not own the licence for the game, which was developed and distributed by US-based Niantic, a spinoff of Google. Last month, Nintendo released the Super Mario Run game for iPhones, which topped download charts and drew more than 40 million downloads globally in the first four days after its release, according to the company. But analysts warned its popularity could be hampered by a relatively high $10 price tag for access to the full game, since many online offerings are free. -AFP basil RELATED ARTICLES Entertainment Jazz artist Thandi Klaasen dies aged 86 Entertainment Top DJ David Guetta’s Mumbai concert gets go-ahead Cricket Stubborn Latham keeps New Zealand afloat Comments and Analysis Analysis:Social media threat to democracy Comments and Analysis Opinion: ANC’s soul-searching works NO COMMENTS LEAVE A REPLY Cancel reply You must be logged in to post a comment.

The chamber has been urging the Cuban government to sign a number of agreements with major companies such as General Electric , negotiated over the last 18 months, before President-elect Donald Trump takes office on Jan. 20. A brief government statement said chamber President Thomas Donohue and Castro discussed “issues of mutual interest." “The goal of the U.S. business community has shifted from seeking more from Cuba to preserving what exists from the soon-to-be Trump administration,” John Kavulich, president of the U.S.-Cuba Trade and Economic Council, said. “‎U.S. companies need the Cuban government to quickly and substantially expand its purchases of products and services and permit a highly visible presence of companies,” he said. Donohue was accompanied by Maurice Greenberg, chairman and chief executive officer of C.V. Starr & Co Inc, a major U.S. insurance company. The chamber has opposed the U.S. trade embargo for decades and is a strong supporter of the normalization process begun by President Barack Obama. That process has included the signing of 17 agreements between the two former Cold War foes and the use of executive orders to punch holes in the embargo, which can be lifted only by the U.S. Congress, now controlled by Republicans. Travel to the Communist-run Caribbean island from the United States has increased, with the start of direct flights and cruises and roaming agreements signed, but there have been no manufacturing or trade deals inked. Cuba and the Obama administration have been scrambling to deepen and cement their detente, through bilateral agreements and commercial links, since Trump's election in November. Cuba agreed earlier this month to export charcoal to the United States, the first export in half a century, and in December Google reached an agreement to place servers on the island to quicken access to its products. Trump has said he will dismantle the still-fragile detente unless Cuba gives the United States a better deal, while providing no specifics. Trump is expected to review Cuba policy upon taking office and has named Jason Greenblatt, a Trump Organization executive and chief legal counsel, as negotiator for sensitive international issues, including Cuba.

Non-emergency municipal offices in Biloxi will be closed on Monday in observance of Great Americans Day. -- City of Biloxi (@CityofBiloxi) January 13, 2017 The reaction from many was swift and furious:  @CityofBiloxi pic.twitter.com/GTfly6QTLH -- BernadetteGiacomazzo (@berngiacomazzo) January 14, 2017 @CityofBiloxi Fixed it for you guys. pic.twitter.com/14JL4zxfcv -- Erick Fernandez (@ErickFernandez) January 14, 2017 The city called it a state-named holiday on Facebook, and later in the evening tweeted a statement from the mayor as well as a link to MLK Jr. Day events planned for Biloxi:  From Mayor Andrew "FoFo" Gilich: "As far as I'm concerned, it's called 'Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Day.'" -- City of Biloxi (@CityofBiloxi) January 14, 2017 While some are wrapped up in a holiday we did not name, please consider the big news coming out of Biloxi today: https://t.co/TIMgJPi1jt -- City of Biloxi (@CityofBiloxi) January 14, 2017 Biloxi spokesman Vincent Creel told the Sun Herald  the declaration of the holiday didn't originate with the city. He said the tweet started out as "innocuous." "We did not decide to start calling it Great Americans Day," he said. "However, whenever the state did years ago, that's how it's listed in the city's code of ordinances." The Sun Herald reported that Great Americans Day doesn't exist as a holiday in Google, Wikipedia or for the Mississippi Secretary of State's Office, which recognizes a joint celebration of Martin Luther King Jr.'s and Robert E. Lee's birthdays. The mayor later posted a statement saying that the Biloxi City Council should change the name to match the federal holiday. "This city's longstanding support of our annual MLK celebrations speaks volumes about our support for this holiday," Gilich wrote. "In fact, we've always celebrated this day as Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Day." He wrote the Great Americans Day name has  been traced back to a Dec. 23, 1985 council proclamation for the third Monday of every January "to honor Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. as well as other great Americans who have made important contributions to the birth, growth and evolution of this country."

Four games made the grade as nominees for Outstanding Achievement in Videogame Writing ahead of the Writers Guild Awards on February 19. Globe-trotting treasure hunt Uncharted 4: A Thief’s End closed out the franchise’s main storyline. As the PlayStation 4’s best-reviewed game, Uncharted 4‘s acclaim was matched by its public reception, becoming the platform’s fastest-selling and overall best-selling release. Meanwhile, the Call of Duty franchise launched a new sub-series with its Infinite Warfare storyline, embracing a futuristic setting even more boldly than before. Also under consideration by Writers Guild members will be Far Cry Primal, a spin-off from an established action franchise that swapped modern day thrill-seeking for prehistoric times. And Mr. Robot 1.5 extfiltratiOn, a thematically faithful tie-in for conspiratorial cybersecurity drama Mr. Robot that came from the same small studio behind another 2016 hit, Oxenfree. Uncharted 4 and Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare also featured among the VES’s slate of nominees, most of whom are competing in film or television categories. Four other potential candidates were named in the VES’s video game Real-Time Project category, those being Dishonoured 2 for an exquisitely detailed, time-distorting mission contained within it, Xbox One and Windows 10 shooter Gears of War 4, the video game, live-action partial hybrid Quantum Break, and the Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them film tie-in and virtual reality experience for Google’s Daydream VR headset. Both Infinite Warfare and Fantastic Beasts, along with two Game of Thrones episodes, were nominated to an Animated Performance category. The VES Awards take place February 7 and the WGAs take place on February 19; their nomination slates were also published the same week as that of the Academy of Interactive Arts and Sciences, whose DICE Awards ceremony is set for February 23. Uncharted 4: A Thief’s End features prominently at the video game industry celebration, accumulating 10 nominations across all categories, with atmospheric adventure Inside on nine, Battlefield 1 on eight, The Last Guardian on seven and Firewatch and Overwatch joint on seven. The DICE Awards’ overall Game of the Year category consists of Uncharted 4, Inside,  Battlefield 1, Overwatch and mobile smash hit Pokémon Go. — AFP-Relaxnews                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Samsung to disclose Note 7 probe results on Jan 23 Facebook announces 'fake news' offensive in Germany E-waste rising dangerously in Asia, UN study shows Samsung probe finds battery was main cause of Note 7 fires, source claims Nintendo’s Switch to go on sale March 3 for US$300 (VIDEO) As labour force shrinks, China turns to robots WhatsApp vulnerable to snooping, report says Nintendo’s Switch to go on sale March 3 for US$300 (VIDEO) Bionic woman: Chinese robot turns on the charm Get the pink coins!

I never imagined when I started writing C&J out of sheer Dilbert-like boredom 13 years ago that it would grow to be what it is today---a mental pressure-relief valve for many, a safe space free of pie fights where new Kossacks can get their feet wet and, above all, a place where we can snork at the lunacy---political and otherwise---that swirls around us like a swarm of drunken, ill-mannered locusts wearing American-flag lapel pins. PolitiFact rates this claim TRUE. Over the coming year---assuming I don’t get sent to one of Trump's bigly re-education camps---I promise to deliver more of the same in the coming twelve months. The snark, the Molly Ivins Moments, the puppy pics, the polls, the drunken posting of entire articles in violation of copyright laws, the Wednesday Rapture Index, the ten-year flashback, a free orangesicle with any fill-up, and mixed-metaphoring my slow descent into madness. To usher C&J---including my very soul---into another year of being bought and paid for by you, the best online community on the planet, please consider making a one-time donation or signing up for a monthly contribution. After all, there is no daily column anywhere that's more celebrated for excellence in mediocrity than this one, and I stand by that claim.

The next Friday the 13th will occur in October, during which we'll encourage you to check your survival bunker food stores and short-wave radio batteries. Y'all have a great evening now, and thanks for your attention. ---Dept. of Homeland Security - By the Numbers: 8 days!!!

THE QUICK BROWN FOX JUMPS OVER THE LAZY DOG pic.twitter.com/Kv1RPFQMPjâ Sauro (@sauro) January 11, 2017 - CHEERS to Theodore Roosevelt.  His Antiquities Act of 1906 has allowed President Obama to preserve---are you sitting down?---over 553 million acres for perpetual preservation, including landmarks essential to the telling and understanding of our country's bumpy history.  Before heading out the door, Obama made a few more important designations this week. He started by expanding the existing California Coastal National Monument and the Cascade-Siskiyou National Monument in Oregon and California.  Then he went into the deep south: Among them is the Birmingham Civil Rights National Monument. It includes the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church, where four little girls died in a bombing set by a white supremacist in 1963, and Kelly Ingram Park, where protesters were hosed down in famous showdowns during the civil rights movement. The 16th Street Baptist Church, now a national monument.   The proclamations also created the Freedom Riders National Monument in Anniston, Ala., which includes the site of a former Greyhound bus station where members of the Ku Klux Klan attacked protesters who demanded integration in interstate busing. The other new site is the Reconstruction Era National Monument, made of a cluster of places in Beaufort County, S.C., where black Americans thrived and preserved their culture. Included in the South Carolina site is the Penn Center, formerly the Penn School, one of the first schools for freed slaves. Not to be outdone, the KKK designated a few of their own cherished sites for special recognition: the original Acme Kerosene-Soaked Wooden Crosses warehouse, Trump Tower, and David Duke's ping-pong table. CHEERS to wars worth winning.  Meanwhile in the land of the ex-presidents, Jimmy Carter made a rather astonishing announcement this week:  Together with his eponymous foundation, Carter, 92, announced on Wednesday that dracunculusm, known as Guinea worm disease, has been eliminated from Mali and that there were just 25 reported cases in three African countries last year. Jimmy Carter comforting a Guinea worm patient in Ghana in 2010. Today there are fewer than 25 known cases left.   Through its partnerships and community programs, the Carter Center has played a key role in the disease’s decline.  The disease is contracted through drinking contaminated water that contains larvae, which mature and mate in the body. The male worm dies and the female worm grows to between 2 to 3 feet until it’s ready to exit the body, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The worms are about as wide as a cooked spaghetti noodle. Carter said a couple years back that “I’d like for the last Guinea worm to die before I do.” I hope he gets his wish. I also hope we figure out a way to keep exactly one Guinea worm alive indefinitely. CHEERS to one of the good guys.  On this date 39 years ago, Minnesota Senator Hubert Humphrey of Minnesota---aka Mayor of Minneapolis, LBJ's vice president, 1968 presidential candidate (great platform except for supporting the Vietnam War) and fierce advocate in the war on poverty---died much too young at 66.  He was wise: "Compassion is not weakness, and concern for the unfortunate is not socialism." "Behind every successful man is a proud wife and a surprised mother-in-law." “We seek an America able to preserve and nurture all the basic rights of free expression, yet able to reach across the divisions that too often separate race from race, region from region, young from old, worker from scholar, rich from poor. We seek an America able to do this in the higher knowledge that our goals and ideals are worthy of conciliation and personal sacrifice.” "Liberalism, above all, means emancipation---emancipation from one's fears, his inadequacies, from prejudice, from discrimination, from poverty." And a special shout-out from Humphrey to the teabaggers: "The right to be heard does not automatically include the right to be taken seriously." Amen. CHEERS to gravity defiance. Elon Musk and his SpaceX team have gone back to the drawing board after the September 1 explosion of their Falcon 9 rocket and are ready to give it another go tomorrow. Launch time: 12:54pm ET from California's Vandenberg Air Force Base.  Weather forecast: sunny and 60.  The mission is to… …place 10 French-designed, U.S.-built Iridium communications [satellites] into one of six orbital planes currently occupied by the company’s aging satellites, which launched between 1997 and 2002 and were originally designed to operate only eight years. […] In addition to launching satellites, the rocket will carry Louie Gohmert and an open mic into space. Hilarity will ensue.   SpaceX completed a major preflight test Thursday, filling the Falcon 9 with propellants and helium pressurant on a launch pad for the first time since a rocket exploded at Cape Canaveral on Sept. 1. The “static fire” test culminated in the ignition of the first stage’s nine Merlin 1D engines for a few seconds, briefly ramping up to full power with 1.7 million pounds of thrust. You can watch the launch on NASA TV.  And to little Tommy Feldmiller, whose loose tooth will be hooked to the craft via a mile-long string between it and the launch control center: stand real still, kid, and you won’t feel a thing. CHEERS to stopping with all the shooting and the banging and the bayoneting and whatnot.  233 years ago tomorrow, on January 14, 1784, Congress ratified the Treaty of Paris, officially ending the War of Independence.  It also included earmarks for a pantaloon museum, a giant biodome for the study of butterfly flatulence, and a bridge to nowhere.  Say this for Congress---they learned quickly. CHEERS to home vegetation.  The weekend TV schedule is slowly morphing back to post-holiday normalcy, including the return of SNL, which will feature Rogue One star Felicity Jones as host and you can probably count on an Alec Baldwin-as-Trump vs. Kate McKinnon-as-Meryl-Streep cage match. Barack Obama reviews his presidency and looks to the future Sunday evening on 60 Minutes.   New home video releases include Deepwater Horizon (John Malkovich's Cajun accent is worth the price alone, but the pulse-pounding depiction of what led to the oil rig explosion is riveting) and the all-star thriller The Accountant. The NHL schedule is here, the NBA schedule is here, and the NFL's division playoff schedule is here. (The Patriots will mess with Texas and turn it into the "Lone Whiner State" Ha Ha Ha Ha!!!)  President Obama sits down for one more interview as president with 60 Minutes.  Then The Simpsons airs its first-ever one-hour episode with Mr. Burns suffering the slings and arrows of the music biz with guest stars Keegan-Michael Key, Taraji P. Henson, Snoop Dogg, RZA and Common.  And here's your Sunday morning lineup:  This Week: Democratic pollster Cornell Belcher, author of the new book "A Black Man In the White House."  John Lewis explains why he will consider Trump an illegitimate president Sunday on Meet the Press.   Meet the Press: Congressman John Lewis (D-GA); Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA); Trump’s chief of bullpucky distribution Reince Priebus. Face the Nation: Newt Gingrich, Mike pence, Sen. Joe manchin (WV) and David Ignatius, i.e. two Republicans, a democrat thinking of becoming a Republican, and David Ignatius. BALANCED!  CNN's State of the Union: Obama’s chief of staff Denis McDonough; Sen. Rand Paul; panel with National Urban League president Marc Morial, Google Santorum, Nina Turner and some flunky who speaks on behalf of Jeff Sessions. Fox GOP Talking Points Sunday: Mike Pence; CIA chief John Brennan on Trump’s war with the intelligence community.  Happy viewing! - Ten years ago in C&J: January 13, 2007 CHEERS to Party Central.  Howard Dean makes yet another grand decision, choosing Denver as the site of the '08 Democratic National Convention.  The final hurdle was cleared when the city promised the snow from '06 would be gone by then. - And just one more… CHEERS to moments that need no introduction. Yesterday… x YouTube Video “For the final time as president, I am pleased to award our nation's highest civilian honor, the Presidential Medal of Freedom. And for the first and only time in my presidency I will bestow this medal with an additional level of veneration, an honor my three most recent successors reserved for only three others: Pope John Paul II, President Ronald Reagan and General Colin Powell. Ladies and gentlemen, I am proud to award the Presidential Medal of Freedom with Distinction to my brother Joseph Robinette Biden, Junior.” ---President Obama  And now please join me in the closing invocation for moments like this: "Nothing, dear! I was just cutting up some onions." Amen. Have a great weekend.  Oh, and happy Rubber Ducky Day.  C&J's mascot Kevin the Socialist Duckstick will be in the kiddie pool tonight, so be sure to say squeak.
