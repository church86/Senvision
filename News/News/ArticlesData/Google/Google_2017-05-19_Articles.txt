Alle Posts des Autors Email: In diesem Artikel geben wir Ihnen eine Schritt-für-Schritt-Anleitung an die Hand, mit der Sie den Google-Chrome-Browser auf Ihrem Android-Smartphone einrichten und die Basisfunktionen nutzen können. Empfehlen Diskutieren Drucken PDF URL Xing LinkedIn Twitter Google+ Facebook Google Chrome hat viele Funktionen in Petto, die kaum einer kennt. Schritt 1: Installation und Einrichtung Nach der Installation müssen Sie den Nutzungsbedingungen und Datenschutzhinweisen zustimmen. Foto: IDG Um die Google-Chrome-App auf Ihrem Smartphone zu nutzen, müssen Sie diese, falls nicht vorinstalliert, zuerst auf Ihrem Androiden einrichten. Öffnen Sie hierfür die Google-Play-Store-Anwendung auf Ihrem Mobilgerät, und tippen Sie in die Suchleiste "Google Chrome" ein. Berühren Sie nun die Schaltfläche "Installieren", und warten Sie, bis der Vorgang abgeschlossen ist. Öffnen Sie die Applikation anschließend zum ersten Mal, und akzeptieren Sie die Nutzungsbedingungen und Datenschutzhinweise. Um Ihre Lesezeichen, Ihren Browserverlauf, Ihre Passwörter und alle Einstellungen auf allen Geräten synchron zu halten, müssen Sie Google Chrome im nächsten Schritt mit Ihrem Google-Mailkonto verbinden. Schließen Sie dann die Einrichtung der App ab. In der Eingabeleiste können Sie anschließend nach einem bestimmten Begriff suchen oder die URL einer Internetseite eingeben, die Sie besuchen wollen. Schritt 2: Tabs verwalten Öffnen Sie ein neues Browserfenster, indem Sie das App-Menü öffnen und auf den Punkt „Neuer Tab“ tippen. Foto: IDG Um in der Chrome-App ein neues Fenster, einen sogenannten Tab, zu öffnen, tippen Sie oben rechts auf die drei Punkte, um das Applikationsmenü zu öffnen. Wählen Sie hier die Option "Neuer Tab". Wenn Sie den Chrome-Browser schon etwas länger verwenden, listet er Ihnen im neu geöffneten Fenster unter der Eingabeleiste eine Reihe Ihrer meistbesuchten Internetseiten auf. Um eine davon zu besuchen, genügt eine kurze Berührung des jeweiligen Symbols. Wenn Sie eine Seite aus der Auflistung entfernen wollen, müssen Sie diese antippen und länger gedrückt halten. Im sich öffnenden Klappmenü finden Sie anschließend die Option "Entfernen". Beenden Sie alle Browserfenster auf einmal, indem Sie in der Tabverwaltung auf die drei Punkte tippen und den Punkt „Alle Tabs schließen“ wählen. Foto: IDG Das kleine Quadrat neben dem Anwendungsmenü gibt Auskunft darüber, wie viele Tabs Sie insgesamt aktuell nutzen. Wenn Sie es berühren, zeigt Google Chrome Ihnen untereinander angeordnet alle genutzten Tabs übersichtlich aufgelistet an. Hier können Sie ganz einfach zwischen den einzelnen Tabs hin und her wechseln. Schließen lassen sich die Fenster entweder über das X am rechten oberen Tabrand oder indem Sie es mit einer Wischgeste nach Links aus dem Bildschirm schieben. Es ist außerdem möglich, alle geöffneten Tabs gleichzeitig zu beenden. Berühren Sie hierfür oben rechts die drei Punkte, und entscheiden Sie sich dann für "Alle Tabs schließen". Um die Inhalte aller geöffneten Fenster zu aktualisieren, öffnen Sie auch hier das App-Menü über die drei Punkte und tippen auf den kreisförmigen Pfeil oben der Symbolleiste. Schritt 3: Lesezeichen hinzufügen und verwalten Über Ihre Lesezeichenliste finden Sie interessante Webseiten schnell wieder oder können mit nur einem Tipp Ihre Lieblingsseite besuchen. Foto: IDG In der Google-Chrome-App haben Sie die Möglichkeit, interessante oder oft besuchte Webseiten mit einem sogenannten Lesezeichen zu versehen. Den Weg, um ein neues Lesezeichnen für eine geöffnete Seite hinzuzufügen, finden Sie über die drei Punkte im App-Menü. Tippen Sie hier auf das kleine Sternchen oben in der Symbolleiste. Sie haben nun erfolgreich ein Lesezeichen für die Seite gesetzt. Um dieses zu bearbeiten, berühren Sie erneut den nun blau eingefärbten Stern. Sie können anschließend den Namen des Lesezeichens bearbeiten. Als Speicherort schlägt Chrome Ihnen automatisch den Ordner "Mobile Lesezeichen" vor. Wenn Sie diesen antippen, lassen sich hier nach Belieben verschiedene Unterordner erstellen. Berühren Sie hierfür einfach jeweils die Option "Neuer Ordner". Alle gespeicherten Lesezeichen finden Sie anschließend im App-Menü unter dem Punkt "Lesezeichen" aufgelistet. Schritt 4: Standortermittlung aktivieren Google Chrome benötigt Ihren Standort, um Ihnen beispielsweise Restaurants in Ihrer unmittelbaren Nähe vorschlagen zu können. Foto: IDG Damit Ihnen der Chrome-Browser so viele nützliche Informationen wie möglich anzeigen kann, müssen Sie ihm dem Zugriff auf Ihre Standortdaten gewähren. Dies ist beispielsweise dann nützlich, wenn Sie nach einem Restaurant oder einer Bar in Ihrer Nähe suchen. Die entsprechende Funktion finden Sie im App-Menü unter "Einstellungen -> Webseite-Einstellungen -> Standort!". Aktivieren Sie hier den Schieberegler. Schritt 5: Datensparmodus aktivieren Sparen Sie beim mobilen Datenverbrauch, indem Sie den Sparmodus im Google-Chrome- Browser aktivieren. Foto: IDG Damit Sie möglichst den ganzen Monat lang mit maximaler Geschwindigkeit surfen können, bietet Google Chrome einen praktischen Datensparmodus. Der Browser leitet dabei die anfallenden Daten über die Google-Server und komprimiert sie. So verringert sich automatisch die Datenmenge, die Sie beim Surfen auf Ihr Smartphone herunterladen. Um den Sparmodus zu aktivieren, öffnen Sie im App-Menü die Einstellungen. Unter "Erweitert" finden Sie den Punkt "Datensparmodus". Aktivieren Sie hier den Schieberegler. Anschließend informiert Sie eine Grafik über die Einsparungen. Beachten Sie aber, dass Sie nicht auf die Sparfunktion zugreifen können, wenn Sie anonym im Inkognitomodus surfen oder Seiten besuchen, deren URL mit https:// anfängt. Außerdem kann es zu Einbußen in der Qualität der dargestellten Bilder kommen. Schritt 6: Anonym surfen Mithilfe des Inkognitomodus können Sie anonym im Internet surfen, ohne dass Ihr Browserverlauf für andere Personen nachvollziehbar ist. Foto: IDG Wenn Sie beim Surfen via Android-Smartphone keine Spuren im Internet hinterlassen wollen, sollten Sie den Inkognitomodus des Chrome-Browsers nutzen. Anonymes Surfen hat nicht nur den Vorteil, dass Ihre Suchanfragen und der Browserverlauf für andere Personen nicht nachvollziehbar sind, Sie können auch beispielsweise zwei Accounts bei Ihrem E-Mail-Dienst oder einer Social-Media-Plattform gleichzeitig nutzen. Auch wenn Sie auf einem fremden Gerät etwa Ihre Mails checken wollen, bietet sich anonymes Surfen an. Tippen Sie oben rechts in der Suchleiste auf die drei Punkte und anschließend auf die Option "Neuer Inkognito-Tab". Artikel als PDF kaufen Newsletter 'Mobile' bestellen!

How Google plans to tackle power consumption even more aggressively in Android Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/05/18 5:29pm PDTMay 18, 2017 13 Plus 1 on G+ 93 Share on Facebook 55 Share on Twitter Total Shares161 Android OS Development Google News Videos Yesterday at I/O Google had an interesting talk called Background Check and Other Insights into the Android Operating System Framework. It's a long name, but really it's about improving battery life in Android. It went on at great length as to how, exactly, they plan on doing that, and it's quite worth a watch. We have the video here, but if you don't have the half-hour to check it out, then you are welcome to read below. The central methodology Google is using to try to improve things is the idea of visibility. When something is running in the background and doing a ton of stuff like calling your location at quick intervals, it results in battery drain. So now Google wants to change how things happen in the background, by ensuring that free-running background services aren't sucking your battery dry. Background apps will be pushed out of memory when they leave the foreground, and requests for things like location or WiFi happening in the background will only occasionally see new information from Android. Applications that would otherwise receive broadcasts also might not wake up unless they are given an explicit call to do so in the broadcast, although there are some exceptions. Apps can still get around this by being foregrounded in some way, but now that will be something visible that the user is aware of. This focus on visibility for apps will also mean developers will have to make decisions about what is really better to the user. If doing an ongoing notification as a means of bypassing the stuff above would confuse a user, is that really the right thing for them to do in that case? Other tools can be used to schedule your tasks ahead of time or to wait for events like the job intent service that developers can use in both pre and post-O environments. Jobs and alarms also allow the OS to defer. So, if something happens that would trigger a bunch of other apps to wake up, like a new picture being taken, that can be passed to those apps one at a time after a delay. That way the user doesn't suddenly have a ton of performance issues and drain out of nowhere. Basically, Google wants to solve some of the problems with battery life by defining bad behaviors for developers, like persistent background services or accidental leaks to the background of typically foregrounded activities, and make it clear that things have to be done the right way going forward or their stuff won't work. But it's also giving them new tools and choices for how to best accomplish the things they need to do. The new features in the Play Console and in Android Studio should also help developers be aware of when they are making these mistakes so that they can be fixed. It's a matter of visibility for the developers as well as visibility for the users. To paraphrase Steve Balmer: Visibility, visibility, visibility. A significant user-facing change of this visibility mindset is a new battery menu in O, with a focus on actionable interaction. Instead of just seeing stuff like Screen and Google Play Services next to a number that they won't understand, now users will be given ways of interacting with that data if they don't like it, and can better see how they are using applications without needing to do a bunch of mental calculations. So, when a user has a problem with their expectations of battery performance and goes looking to see what might be causing it, they are more likely to find what caused it, understand what it means, and take action about it. All of these changes are is in pursuit of Google's holy grail: multi-day battery life. Right now the tools in software aren't all there, but these are steps that can take us in that direction.

Good feature to take from iOS Knowledgeborn Allah This does seem similar to what Apple implemented in iOS, but I'm curious about how this will impact RAM management. If it reduces the cache file too much, it'll just close the application completely, and you'll have to start over every time you want to use the app again. Apple somehow found a way around this problem, even in devices with less RAM, but I'm not too sure how Google will accomplish this. Even "doze" on my Pixel XL kills apps in the background all the time. This new thing sounds it could potentially make the problem worse. Justin Osborne Well I sure can tell a difference since upgrading, that's for sure. The new battery section makes me feel a lot better about how the battery is looking. But that's where it ends. Today, I got a full hour less out of my battery than normal. 2 hours vs 3-3.5 on the Pixel. That said, it's a beta, so I'm not complaining. It's definitely not the direction I want to go tho (nor are these new emoticons, sigh). marcusmarcus2 "Google's holy grail: multi-day battery life." I'm glad, but can we get a two pronged attack to address this. Yes, Google needs to keep improving the software side, but OEMs need to help out and quit making thinner phones. They are thin enough, give us more battery capacity. AbdulB1 actually they save quite a lot by putting small batteries in the phones instead of big ones. Krzysztof Jozwik I'm not sure you read OP's comment. Nothing was said about saving... AbdulB1 smaller capacity battery is much cheaper marcusmarcus2 My original comment was not about savings, cheapness, cost, etc. Jack Jennings You've said the same thing twice for no reason. Krzysztof Jozwik I wouldn't say "much" I'm no expert on the matter, but last I checked replacement batteries aren't that expensive, and I don't have the buying power of an oem AbdulB1 Most phones today dont have replacement batteries, they have unremovable ones. OEM or no OEM a 3000mAh battery will always be cheaper than 4000mAh one. marcusmarcus2 I can find batteries for my different Moto G phones that have "Non-User replaceable batteries" for nearly the same price as my LG phones that have user replaceable batteries online. Most likely the OEMs can get them for about the same as well so replaceable or not really does not matter. Either way, yes a 3000mAh battery will be cheaper than a 4000mAh one for OEMs, but probably not much at all, especially at the volume they would by at. I'm guessing they are choosing smaller batteries to make their phones thinner and not because it is slightly cheaper for them. Thinness is better to advertise to most consumers as most consumers are drawn to looks over functionality now a days. I still prefer function over looks for my devices. Krzysztof Jozwik And non replaceable will always be cheaper than replaceable. The point is, the batteries aren't the bulk of the cost. Geoff Johnson What the hell is your point? He never said anything about cost, he was just talking about stop making phones thinner for design and aesthetic reasons. james fuston The idea that smaller and thinner phones result in less battery life is a bit of a misnomer. For an example, I'd refer you to the iPhone SE. marcusmarcus2 I never said smaller and thinner. I just said thinner. They could make some of the phones the same height and width as the current one but make it a little thicker to give a thicker battery, and that would help with the battery life. james fuston Okay, but your general sentiment is still that battery life is tied directly to physical size which, again stating my example of the iPhone SE, isn't the case. The power draw of the components is far more important than the physical size of the phone. marcusmarcus2 My general sentiment is ONLY in regards to thickness of the phone. My sentiment is not to width or height, which also make up the size of the phone. The width and height is usually determined more by the screen where thickness is more often do to battery. A larger screen (component) will draw more power than a smaller screen, I agree with you there. But you seem to think the size of the battery does not make a difference, please correct me if I am wrong. Using your example of iPhone SE, if they would have made that a little thicker than it is now by making the battery larger, that would have made the battery life even longer than it already is. That is my point. james fuston > A larger screen (component) will draw more power than a smaller screen, I agree with you there. Let me give this one more shot. "your general sentiment is still that battery life is tied directly to physical size which, again stating my example of the iPhone SE, isn't the case" To break out the pieces, battery life is tied...to physical size...which, again...isn't the case. In other words, we do not agree. The iPhone SE is the exact same size as the iPhone 5S and it gets 30%+ better battery life purely through efficiency in components. To say high mAh results in long battery life is a misnomer that the G6 or V20 should be a clear reminder of. You also cannot equate physical size to battery capacity as energy density is not a universal measurement. marcusmarcus2 You are comparing different phones with different components. I agree with you that component efficiency has an effect on battery life. But... Let me give you one more shot. We will use your iPhone SE for this. If there were 2 versions of the SE. Both have the exact same components except one has a battery that is 1000 mAh larger than the other (thus making it slightly thicker), than the one with the larger battery would have more battery life, Thus the thicker one would have better battery life. That is what I am saying. I'm not comparing large phones to small phones. I'm saying if they had a larger battery in a phone with the exact same specs/components then the battery life would be better. That is all my point was. Do you not agree with that? EDIT: Yes, size of the battery may not increase with capacity due to density, but it usually will increase in size as it does increase in capacity, especially if it increases a lot. Geoff Johnson Again, you're talking about it being smaller. The iPhone SE gets good battery life because it has a 4" screen. The complaint is that phones are getting THINNER. Meaning that they still have 5.5-6" displays, but are thinner and translate to smaller batteries. james fuston Nope, not at all. The cell in the SE is about 50mAh bigger than the 5S (which is the exact same size). The 30%+ battery life improvement comes from more efficient components, not just their size. marcusmarcus2 Technically it is 2 dimensional train of thought. Also, if they increased it horizontally or vertically, then they would most likely have to increase the dimensions of the phone horizontally or vertically, thus changing the size of the screen or bezel. Increasing it thickness wise means they would not have to change the look of the of the front of the phone. Anywho, I'm only talking about thickness, not height, width, different components, different phones, not small phones or big phones. I'm talking just battery capacity, if all other components remain the same. Thickening the battery would add battery capacity without changing the over all look much at all. It could be any phone of your choosing. If adding a thicker/higher capacity battery to whatever 1 phone you want, that phone would have a longer battery life. Do you not agree with that logic? JD The SE wasn't thinner. Ryne Hager Give me a OnePlus with 5000mAh and I would be so happy. someone755 Give me a 4.7" phone like the og Moto X and I would be so happy. Neither of us are going to be happy, Ryne. Drakenoid OG Moto X updated for current year would be perfect for me. Kristian Ivanov I highly agree on the thin phones part. Bought a Huawei P10 2 days ago, for me, that thing is unusable without a case to make it a bit fatter. Karly Johnston If they fix idle battery drain that doesn't become an issue. marcusmarcus2 I'm not saying they should not fix battery drain. I'm saying if they fix battery drain AND add higher capacity battery (making phone a little thicker), they could increase battery life even more than just addressing one of them. So if fixing the battery drain adds another day and a thicker battery adds another day, you'd go from 1 day to 3 days instead of just 2 days from only fixing battery drain. Karly Johnston The battery life the current 625 phones are getting is where flagships need to be. That should be enough for anyone. marcusmarcus2 Everyone is not all the same. It may be enough for you. I'm saying, phones are beyond thin enough and could be thicker to increase battery life even more beyond what a 625 phone can do. Now, this is my opinion in regards to how I would like to use a phone. You are welcome to your own opinion. I'm not going to say what should be enough for anyone other than me. Karly Johnston The OEMs don't think that is what the vast majority of people need or want. Their target is a full day of battery life which is what most people are worried about. It isn't my opinion, it is the industry opinion of what the marketing priorities are. X-47B My phone has 4000 mAh battery, and it's 5.5-inch display. I easily get 2 days of battery even after heavy usage. Margaritas Ante Porcos Installed O on my 6p and battery still drains like a whore in a bukkake twelvesome. Google really can't do nothing at this point. Android is breaking to pieces. So many things needed to be fixed in O but instead Android's got even worse. That notification empty desert area of white grey nothingness kills me the most. Hate it really bad. The last Android I liked was 6th. catalysto Not sure what you're talking about. Battery life on my 6P with the new O is great. Maybe you have an aging battery? Margaritas Ante Porcos as long as your 6p works great, nothing else matters, right? Roy That's right. catalysto Just saying. My anecdotal evidence is as good as yours. And having poor battery life across multiple OS versions is a pretty strong indicator for a bad battery, don't ya think? In fact, I had the same problem with a previous 6P. iFeign Complain some more about your beta software Margaritas Ante Porcos It started with 7.1.2. Do you really need to be a btch when bad things happen to others? Roy For me everything goes smooth on my 6P on 7.1.2. so I need to complain that Android to good. The Wrath of Kahn If your 6P has shut down even once before reaching about 5% then you most likely have one of the defective batteries. I had to have mine replaced, but after that, it runs all day like a charm. ODP2 improved it, if anything. Margaritas Ante Porcos it was fine for a long time until I updated to 7.1.2. That update screwed the battery that was working superb all the time. DANA Try to do a factory reset, it fixes many problem for some user. Margaritas Ante Porcos It was one of the first things I did. Twice. Did not help. Paul_Werner Yeah you got to call Google (if you got yours from the Play Store). They've been replacing 6Ps with factory refurbished ones even out of warranty (source: it happened to me) Matthew Skalecki The update didn't screw up your battery. The battery was going to crap out on you regardless of which Android version you had. This happened to many people including me. Replacing the battery fixes the issue; reverting to a previous os does nothing. Zach Mauch Did you go through Google or a local shop? The Wrath of Kahn Unfortunately it was out of warranty, had a friend with the skills do it for me. JD I need more of this colorful imagery to describe simple everyday problems. mchalakov First off you are using a beta OS don't complain. Second thing is that battery drain comes mostly from the (bad)apps - if you watched the video or read the article you could understand. Third - I'm pretty sure you can go back to Marshmallow if you are so so so unhappy with Nougat or O. Jakst Really? Yesterday was my first day with Android O. I plugged my phone out at 7, and come home at midnight with 35 % battery left. I've never had that kind of battery life in my 6P before. So I've seen huge gains with this O preview. thereasoner The Android O beta I'm using is so slow to charge my Pixel today that it seems like that's what they tackled​....and not in a good way. iFeign Surprise, surprise, you're running BETA software. Smh. thereasoner Yeah I know and I'm sure it will get fixed between now and September. I'm just saying that the current difference in charge time is quite noticable at this point. AbdulB1 maybe they removed quick charge support in beta mattcoz Pixel never had quick charge. AbdulB1 hmm interesting. I thought it has qualcomm processor so it must have qc 3.0 too. Must be some proprietary stuff or qualcomm must be asking for more money to enable it. mattcoz Google is pushing the open USB-C power delivery standard. AbdulB1 Display screen eats up most of my battery. I can't see what google is doing will fix it somehow. We need different types of screens now. iFeign Uhh, it's as if you expect things to use NO battery at all. Infinite battery life! Of course using the screen, aka, using the phone, is going to be the largest proportionate power drain - no matter how fancy the screen tech. AbdulB1 battery tech has still not improved and nor did the screen tech. I can accept that the screen tech will remain same for a long time but as far as batteries are concerned they can be improved , made for longer number of recharge cycles but that hasn't caught up with the manufacturers yet. One thing which can be done is increasing the battery capacity but we all know this is not happening as phone manufactures think it will make phones bulky , add weight and in long term affect the sale of newer devices. Latheryin Multi day battery life will not happen until new battery tech comes around. With people needlessly having screen on times of 5+ hours there is no way to keep a battery charged for extended periods. Krzysztof Jozwik I average 2 hours of screen on time a day. Just because some use their phone 24/7 doesn't mean we all do. I have a job where I'm not on my phone, at home I have better screens to get info from. The phone is there when I need it. Your nonstop use case is not the norm. Latheryin As do I but that is not the norm. Might want to look at any forum about battery life and looking at screen on times. Most want and use 5+ hours. It's mainly the older generation like us that doesn't need it and are not on the device all the time. Krzysztof Jozwik Obviously the forums about battery life have people winning that they want 48 hours of screen on. That is not the norm. Sure, lots of people want that, most do not. Latheryin Most want more screen on time. Why do you think battery life is such an issue. disqusdeeznuts My Moto Z Play begs to differ. Motorola does it right with this phone. It has a good size battery (3510), an efficient processor, and runs smooth. It can be done, but for some reason, it just isn't a focus for a majority of manufacturers. Latheryin Well sure all the devices with that mid range chip and battery combo can get ok battery life. I could easily. Get 2 days out of my device and it only has a 3200 battery. It is not the oem. It's people. They need to spend less time look at their phone and more time living life. Which many are unprepared for. Cakefish I'm going the leaked Moto X4 continues that legacy onwards! Rod Ever heard of the Moto z Play, or Lenovo P2? Latheryin As already stated on that. The moto has a mid tear chip. As for the Lenovo, nope. Can't say I have, it's either not sold in my country or a mid low tier device that I wouldn't have noticed. Just looked. They both use the same mid tier chip. Also that does have a good battery. But that like the K1000 with a 10000 battery are the exception and seldom are they flagship quality. WarpspeedScp The Moto z does not have an SD 820 on it. Neither does the P2. It's very annoying that manufacturers can't give us something functional instead of eye-candy for once. Rod While it's not top of line sillicon, real world testes have proven that, for everyday tasks, there's virtually no difference between the S625 ans 821 WarpspeedScp Well, my phone has an SD 650, and dolphin emulator just about keeps up (wind waker and super smash Bros). On an 820, there would definitely be better results. Paul Troy I have a better idea. Get the hardware manufacturers to put a bigger battery in their devices. 💡 Taedirk If we could convince hardware manufacturers to do something useful, we wouldn't be on yet another revision to how Android updates the OS. Alex Yeah so this way the horrible wakelocks (that Android makes almost impossible to manage) will be less visible. Cakefish Why not both? Zach Mauch All I want to know is can they stop wakelocks. JD Same bullshit every year. I'll believe it when I see it. Unless Android O somehow allows me to download more mAh. Morten Ulv Are you trying to say Android battery life hasn't improved VASTLY over the years? JD Yep in fact it's regressed Morten Ulv I have no such issues. Better battery all across the board. JD What ever you're smoking pass that shit around Morten Ulv Your shit must be stronger than mine. browngeek I miss the days of my Xperia Z3 Lollipop and Stamina mode. Used to get 48 hours and 5-6 hours SOT. D13H4RD2L1V3 I hope this actually does something when the final build is out. I'm getting tired of hearing of every new battery improvement in a new version of Android only to have a wakelock pretty much make all of that moot. Dennis Ulijn I am on the Android O beta, and i must say that the information i get from it it really useful! I never could find the wakelocks because i'm not rooted, but now i can easily see what apps use up battery in the background. Awake meditation app was in use for 15 minutes (meditation) and active in the background for 1 hour (basically, ever since the meditation)! "Restrict background usage" to on, and we'll see what it brings tomorrow. PI this is interesting .... :) ,, Whats the current update Dennis Ulijn I'm in Europe so I just woke up. I'll let you know end of the day. Sabin Bajracharya Meanwhile Google's own apps will somehow be able to bypass this restriction :D Michael Sørensen Google's own location services, Now cards, Chrome, etc. eats the most battery for me - even worse with location history on. How about fixing that first...? WarpspeedScp Try Firefox! Also, turn location off as soon as you can. mlm5em But with O, you can now turn off Background activity on an app specific basis. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/eaaaef5de863733535628a24f5b0d44f888ae3ff0cb89d1c8cffc0680083c526.png mattcoz Good to see there's an option to turn it off. Morten Ulv Very handy! IncCo Anything that improves the battery life is awesome John Monks I have concerns about this. There are some apps I *want* running in the background, but I don't want them filling up the notification shade. One example, Lightflow has to have a pointless notification in order to do the job I installed it to do. I know it's there, any consequences for my battery life are mine to live with. It would be OK if I could toggle a setting to permit a particular app to run a 'free running background service' silently but this is Google so I expect I'll have to put up with spam instead (and no, collapsed notifications are still notifications), or there will be a toggle that does nothing, like the 'ignore optimisation' setting that currently exists. Drakenoid There apparently is, check comments above, there's a screenshot. Cakefish It's about damn time. All hail Android O. AdamH So does it mean my phone will be useless? something_new Apple was right then Đức Thành I'm beginning to get excited again, even knowing that actually achieving this would take many years. Fidelator Allow us, the end user, to have absolute control over which apps can run in the background under certain conditions, I have disabled notifications on Facebook and Instagram yet they still have multiple persistent RAM hogging battery sucking services 100% of the time smeddy My next phone won't get a look-in without a 4000mah+ battery in it. Since Samsung dropped the removable battery, battery anxiety has crept back into my life.

Android O Developer Preview 2 gets a small bump to OPP2.170420.019, partially fixes Android Pay but isn't installing on many Nexus devices Richard Gao Follow View All Posts 2017/05/18 6:32pm PDTMay 18, 2017 39 Plus 1 on G+ 98 Share on Facebook 47 Share on Twitter Total Shares184 Android O Android OS Google News Nexus 5X Nexus 6P Nexus Player Pixel Pixel XL Android O's second developer preview was only released yesterday, but Google has already released an update for it. We're getting bombarded with tips from readers with Nexus and Pixel devices alike. This update reportedly somewhat fixes Android Pay, which did not open at all on yesterday's version. However, it appears that Nexus devices are having trouble updating. This OTA bumps the version number to OPP2.170420.019 and is weighing in at anywhere between 38.8 and 55.9MB, depending on which Google device you have. One tipster informed us that Pay is no longer throwing him an 'unsupported in this build' message and shows him a normal screen with his cards, but hasn't tested whether they're working or not.   A rare, successful install on a Nexus 6P. While the update seems to be installing just fine on Pixel and Pixel XL devices, a majority of owners with Nexus devices appear to be having some trouble. From what we can tell, units of Nexus 5X and 6P smartphones, as well as the Nexus Player, are throwing errors and showing the dead Android logo in recovery. After a hard reboot, the devices are booting up fine, but they remain on yesterday's OPP2.170420.017 build. One user is claiming that Android Pay has begun working for his 6P, despite the install appearing to fail. However, there are users successfully updating their 6Ps to the 0.019 build. (update: It looks like those who flashed the O factory image are updating without issue, while those who took the OTA from Nougat are struggling. This is due to devices that updated from Nougat via OTA retaining the 7.1.2 build fingerprint. Flashing the factory image and then taking the OTA should get the update to work.) Factory image and OTA downloads are not yet available. An official post in the Android Beta Program Google+ page states that the update will hit all devices currently enrolled in the preview within the next few hours, but given the installation failures that Nexus devices are seeing, it's likely to be halted. We'll update this post with more information when we get it.

Dirge Not the ugly, ugly dots! No! Trooper311 Have not noticed that myself. Tiuri Elvander They never appeared for me in the first place. Do you know which apps support them?? Leroy You have to enable the special permissions, under apps& notifications Maxime Labrecque-Raymond Where exactly? do you have a screenshot ? Tiuri Elvander If I go to Settings > Apps & Notifications > App Info, and select Gmail (because it's often shown to support dots in screenshots), Then I go to App notifications and Badge app icon is switched on, yet none appear. Is there a different setting somewhere that I've missed??? Ah, just saw another reply. It's pixel launcher only :( Laraib Zafar Khan Is the notification dot only for pixel launcher? Tr3ple Yes Daniel Grobe I have pixel launcher on my nexus 5x, the dots dont work for me.. nor does the picture in picture. Dirge Installed fine on my Pixel; Won't install on my Nexus Player. vwnut13 Does Hulu open on your Nexus Player? Dirge I don't use Hulu so I don't know. Kyle Anyone having scrambled audio when playing videos? Usually within Facebook or streamable videos. Julian Berger Yes I have it when playing Youtube videos in chrome maestro PL Installed fine on my 6P. Android Pay enabled OkieDokie This small OTA failed to install for me twice (Nexus 6P) 2 Men-E Thanks for the update on the update... My Nexus 6P and I await good news... vwnut13 Had to revert on my Nexus player, as the update broke Hulu. On second thought, wonder if it has anything to do with my unlocked bootloader... Nexus✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Remember folks this software isn't ready for a daily driver yet. They say so themselves. Consider yourself lucky if your using it and they fix stuff like android pay. Also do not forget to unlock your bootloader if you are using the beta. If you do not unlock the bootloader and the beta on your phone goes south you can not use your computer to fix your phone and restore it. Period. The only fix is to send it in. You can re lock the bootloader after the final stable builds are released. Carson Saldanha Wow, thanks for that second part. Didn't think about that. 👍 Dn Bro I disagree with the bootloader thing. I think if they are sending out fixes to Android Pay, they actually want the bootloaders locked. Also, I would say that at the very least, make sure you go into deveopler settings and allow unlocking. That way, you can at least still unlock your phone if it won't boot. Matty032 Is that the USB Debugging option? ZettabyteGamer I'm using it as my daily and while it has only been one day it has been pretty solid for me. It's in beta, I think it is ready for daily driver use for people who are okay with minor hiccups here and there. Martial Clausse I don't think it's ready yet. Lots of apps are crashing, including inbox and Google search... Joshua Lillis The only app that FC on me is Samsung pay, smooth sailing for me. Martial Clausse Out of curiosity, which device are you using ? And did you update through the OTA or flashed the factory image ? Joshua Lillis I have the pixel XL, I enrolled in the beta program and took two ota, one from nougat to o and then the .019 OTA. SomeGuy112 Seems pretty stable on my Pixel XL. The Pixel performance lead at Google said the Beta is pretty stable on Twitter recently but maybe that's only for the Pixel version. https://mobile.twitter.com/t_murray/status/864927591274127360 Laraib Zafar Khan Apple music is FC too BrandoHD This information isn't correct, you can flash official factory images with a locked bootloader ZettabyteGamer I hope you didn't mean to reply to me, because I never said anything about a bootloader. Joshua Lillis I think he meant to reply to Nexus 2 Men-E I don't use Android Pay, but I do notice the signal will drop for extensive periods of time on my Nexus 6P... Most stuff is running "okay", though... LALO Everything works fine on my Google Pixel. Surprisingly no apps have crashed since I updated. blackeyeX2 On my 6P, I have had more FC's and freezing than I did on the Alpha preview. boop Looks like it comes with the new Assistant features (or maybe I just got them at the same time). Dirge You got them the same time. It is a server side switch. . Carlos Rodríguez The OTA fails because the recovery has an old build fingerprint from 7.1.2, so the installer fails. You can try to install the OTA many times and it will fail. When you get the error, press Power + Volume Up to see the actual error, then you can safely reboot from there. The solution is to sideload the full DP2 OTA from here (https://developer.android.com/preview/download-ota.html ) or the factory image from here (https://developer.android.com/preview/download.html ) and then you can install the small OTA. Cheers! Peter Good work sir. Thanks for the info. Richard Gao Thanks for letting us know. I've added this to the post. Mike Arnett Stupid question: the OTA on my phone to this was 55mb, but the OTA package is 1GB. Is this the full image, and will it wipe all my data? Carlos Rodríguez The full OTA shouldn't wipe the device, make a backup just in case. blackeyeX2 The 55mb one was an update to the full (1GB) released yesterday. bobfrealy Per Carlos R.'s suggestion, after having registered for beta, taking 017 ota, failing with E3001 error on 019 ota, I downloaded and sideloaded the 017 ota. now the 019 system update notification is nowhere to be found. any idea on how to get that back? just wait? meanwhile recover still shows 7.1.2, and Android Pay seems to be running fine. Carlos Rodríguez After some minutes the update should show up. Check for updates. It eventually appeared for me the 3 times it failed to install. bobfrealy yep, it showed back up. and still failed (that's why i mentioned my recovery version, most likely the issue). will likely have to do full image. better to have a full clean install, just a pain with much setup to do afterward. blackeyeX2 Google Pay. My update failed, but Android Pay is now working anyways. Zikaeroh This didn't work for me. After sideloading the update and trying to install the OTA, I get the same error. I'd simply flash just the recovery image from the factory image, but I'm not OEM unlocked. :( Carlos Rodríguez Indeed. The only solution is to unlock the bootloader and flash the DP2 recovery. I guess we're screwed until google does something. Paige Turner I'am freelancing using the web, performing basic jobs that requires from you personal pc or alternatively laptop and additionally internet service access and so I couldn't be more satisfied... 6 months have passed by when i started off this and also i profited up to now overall 36,000 dollars... Basically i profit almost $80/hourly and work for 3 to 4 h everyday.And superb point regarding this work is that you can actually decide when to work yourself as well as for how long and you are compensated at the end of each week.>>>> learn by clicking here how to do it right now Flint_PS 017 OTA sideload doesn't work, I got the error again Fernando Pena So, I decided to start from scratch and flashed the factory image, following updating the .19 OTA. Everything went just fine and I was able to boot the device and restore my backup. Then I started to install/update my apps and noticed that Google App isn't updating, the app keeps refusing to update even downloading the latest APK from apkmirror. It's currently stuck at version 6.16 and this sucks because assistant is not working. Play store doesn't show any updates even if I apply for Google app beta. I don't know what to do, I would appreciate some help... blackeyeX2 The updated images ending 19 are not available yet, the ones posted are still 17. So OTA is only option for now. JC I was getting the same error. It never successfully installed on my nexus 5x. Dn Bro So I did the OTA yesterday on my Nexus 6P, got the Android Pay is unsupported, as was the case. Today, tried this update, it failed, but now when I open the android pay it shows my cards like normal. Not sure if they work, but there you go. Nate Hallett I'm still on the .017 build from yesterday on my Pixel XL, I took the beta OTA and have opened & used Android Pay without a problem. I don't understand why so many people don't have Android Pay enabled on yesterday's build, even with the N Preview they enabled Android Pay so why would it be different this time around? I'm currently waiting for the .019 OTA to finish installing, I'll update my comment with the results. nxtiak I'm on 017 on my XL and I just opened Android Pay and it said it's not enabled in this preview. Installing 019 now. lomsha It's only toward the end that pay was enabled on n previews, not from the start. Frisi Started installing on my Pixel XL. After step 1 was done, it restarted. Still on .017. Thing is, it started step 2 but it hangs here. Andeoid Pay now works, though. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/721d0f338ee7cfe4ff4a19f06d55c9318dd4fa5e7be02f24d9f4befb5eff7b14.png Frisi Well, it started moving after I posted this. I don't know what's causing it to take that long. daburghit It failed for me on a Nexus 5X but I can secondarily confirm that Android Pay works post-failure on the 17 build. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/7c5c1a621e6af03a2092437d0a84552a7cb821509966e5f48c9bdb8ce2a19af5.png Anthony Castanza Android Pay started loading again for me *without* installing this update. It appears to be a server side fix and not directly related to this build. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/bca05de36f641e9afb90773dd4129e37cd5eee46791485bab34ec82e2c423f39.png Chris Thurber Same for me as well except on a 6P! JeffCO Just updated on the XL and Android Pay which was not working earlier now comes up. Haven't tried to use it. Bizziet I was hoping it fixed the now broken MMS issue in messages! Try to add a picture and the whole messages app freezes. Pixel XL on T-mobile. ZettabyteGamer Just updated my XL and when I go to add a new card to Android Pay I get "Android Pay can't be used on this device" So it isnt fixed for me atleast. Lucas Araujo It seems that the update has been pulled. My N5X had the same problem while applying the update and it is not showing in the updates anymore. My Android version still at *.017. Also, after update failure, my google photos app lost its icon and ir showing a generic Android Robot icon. bobfrealy My Photos app icon had this problem immediately after taking 017 ota. reboot; clear cache; etc, re-install app, nothing restored icon. :( doesn't matter now as i'm likely full 017 flashing. blackeyeX2 I disabled the app (which then uninstalled app to original version), then it updated and Icon is back to normal!! Just wiping the cache will not work. blackeyeX2 It's not pulled. It will show up again in your notifications in 30 min, or so. I've tried it a couple of times and each time it reappears after some time. JohnyNoLegs Quality google. Brian Sandoval Not sure if anyone had this issue after update on 6P? I have a hidden network for my wifi and device once updated will no longer connect to it. Ján “Johnny” Valentík This new build fixed for me Google Play Music inside Android Auto on my Pixel XL. In 0.17 I couldn't play any music nor the widget with controls would show... Mattsus The OTA update worked for me this morning(UK time), this is coming directly from an OTA update from Nougat to O Dev Preview 2, can confirm Android Pay now works. neon tiger Have you tried actually using it or just opening the app ? Mattsus I've tried both opening the app, adding new card details as old one expired yesterday, and using it against several terminals. Can confirm no issues thus far. Before update, opening the app wouldn't work but was able to pay using it no problem at all. Joshua Lillis I guess I'm lucky, took the beta OTA from 7.1.2, and now took the .019 OTA just fine. Couldn't flash a factory image if I wanted to, damn Verizon. mieszk3 Nexus 5X 019 OTA: https://android.googleapis.com/packages/ota-api/google_bullhead_bullhead/44bdd4f9967717bad5ef82a54c1dbf2c1ba92fa1.zip Rowan I tried to install it today on my Nexus 6p and a error message came up. I thought it was about to start boot looping but it turned on minutes later to my releif Besnik Rrustemi It worked for me on my Nexus 6P. But maybe it is because i was on 7.1.2 and updated to DP2 the moment they announced it on live Google I/O (0.17 build) and after the first update the 0.19 installed without problem, So maybe the issue is updating directly from 7.1.2 to DP2 0.19 ? jon Hutchinson The update failed on my Nexus 6p. Though android pay began to work. Double edge sword though I'm glad my android pay is restored. I'm still on 0.17. Updated over OTA and even for a factory reset while on Android o. iftekhar bongo my nexus 5x showing error while installing upate... any solution? Leroy This latest build seems to cause problems with safetynet. Stock phones are registered as 'uncertified' in the play store and Android pay doesn't work because the devices are rooted, only they're not.. Small OTA received over the beta factory images on 5X.. Device is marked as uncertified now lol https://www.reddit.com/r/AndroidPreviews/comments/6c0bsg/small_ota_received_over_the_beta_factory_images/ neon tiger Yeah my banking app won't let me use fingerprint login because of this. Leroy Yeah it's really annoying. Hopefully they can fix it on their end without. Would be a shame is we have to reflash 017 build or wait for next OTA to fix it. compuguy1088 Same here on the PixelXL. I'm sure they will update SafetyNet soon enough to fix this. wickets So, next question....when are they fixing PIP?? :) Ernie My Nexus 6p also got an error trying to update from . 17 to. 19 as well. Cache wipe didn't solve the problem either. Any other tricks? Alex Kruger I installed the update via OTA on my Pixel XL, now I can open Android Pay, but I can't add any cards because it thinks my bootloader is unlocked. It's not, I've done everything through the official OTA channel. nextelnutt I received the update and got the dead Android error. However, my build number did indicate .019, then 25 minutes ago, I noticed the update was available again for my 6P. So I downloaded and installed again and device restarted fine. As for Android Pay, I will try it when I am out shopping today. Robert Macdonald Play store now showing as uncertified, Android pay loads but says cannot be used. Otherwise it installed just fine on my pixel. Andreas Constantinides 6p here, got the issue. JoeInMO On my Pixel XL I get "Android Pay can't be used on this device." I'm not rooted or bootloader unlocked. I never had Pay set up before. Matty032 I have the same error. Maxime Labrecque-Raymond Got the issue and my DOTs dosen't work Nexus 6P blacleyeX2 The OTA Nexus 6P failed, but I can confirm that Android Pay is now working and I have used it for a transaction. Not sure how that worked, any ideas? Marty Got the error. 6P. blacleyeX2 The available images are only for the images ending 17 and not the new 19, so we can't side load yet. mieszk3 All of you with unlocked bootloader -> manually flash via fastboot: bootloader, boot, radio and recovery and then 019 OTA will work. (Probably only bootloader is necessary). Marty Firmware not available yet. mieszk3 Use 017 version, then sideload 019 OTA Marty "Factory image and OTA downloads are not yet available." mieszk3 Nexus 5X 017->019 OTA: https://disq.us/url?url=https%3A%2F%2Fandroid.googleapis.com%2Fpackages%2Fota-api%2Fgoogle_bullhead_bullhead%2F44bdd4f9967717bad5ef82a54c1dbf2c1ba92fa1.zip%3AgIXISwZNuhjf2FlMgjO4Va15Lr0&cuid=1370072 Firmwares: https://developer.android.com/preview/download.html Marty I was just contrasting what you said with what the article said. I'm not desperate to update my 6P. I don't use it anymore. Ultra Sage My nexus 5x worked fine for the first few hours. Then when this update came out, I tried installing it but my phone kept on crashing and restarting after every few minutes. It was not bootloop since I could receive calls, but if I opened anything else, then it would crash and restart. I finally managed to use terminal to unlock the boot loader and restore nougat factory image, since the OTA download would stall the screen, and it would restart. I was a beta tester for Nougat, but this was a bad experience. Kris Fannin Same issue with my Nexus 6P. Update fails. Just another data point for you and thanks for the information. ctk4949 I was about to switch back to my Pixel XL from my S8+. But when I tried connecting my Gear S3 watch, it wouldn't open the app. It force closes each time. :( Matt McNair After the update Android Pay will launch but I just tried to pay with it and I get a message stating that my Pixel XL isn't eligible. Had to pull out the ole wallet. StW I tried to apply this update twice on my Nexus 6P but each time the updated failed near the beginning of the install. However, yesterday Android Pay was not working (unsupported developer version message) but today, even though the install failed, Android Pay works. Cael Android Pay works on my Pixel XL after receiving this update. Ernie I think Google might have pulled the . 19 update for the Nexus 6p. I haven't gotten a notification for the update for almost 2 hours now. EnerJi I still have a notification pending on my Nexus 5X. I wonder if that means it's been fixed on the 5X? I've been holding off on trying it until I see some folks confirm that it works for people who OTAd from 7.1.2. Matty032 At first I got the root error with Android pay. But, I cleared cache and then restarted the phone. I was then able to complete the transaction. Works now. That's after Google Chat Support told me it wouldn't work with O. LOL Ian Kumlien 019 ota is up and will apply on a 017 Android O OTA (as in N -> O) phone via ADB sideload Guilherme Noronha Just got the update notification again after failing​ to install this morning.

Netflix was just the start: Google Play Console lets developers exclude app availability for devices that don't pass SafetyNet Rita El Khoury Follow View All Posts 2017/05/18 3:57am PDTMay 18, 2017 93 Plus 1 on G+ 108 Share on Facebook 82 Share on Twitter Total Shares283 Google News Last weekend, a huge turmoil swept the root-enthusiast Android community as it was discovered then confirmed that the Netflix app was being blocked from showing up in search results on the Play Store for rooted devices. At the time, Netflix said it was using Widevine to block unsupported devices, but that made no sense to us: the app was still functional if it was sideloaded, it was only not showing up as compatible in the Play Store. So what sorcery was Netflix really using?! Turns out it's a new function of the Google Play Console. As part of the updates announced for the Play Console at I/O 2017, Google mentions a new Device Catalog section under Release management that lets developers choose with intricate granularity which devices their app supports on the Play Store. Devices can be viewed and excluded by many attributes including RAM and SoC, but the important factor we're interested in is SafetyNet Attestation. New "Device catalog" lets devs manage the exclusions. Developers will be able to choose from 3 states shown in the top image: not excluding devices based on SafetyNet, excluding those that don't pass integrity, or excluding the latter plus those that aren't certified by Google. That means any dev could potentially block their apps from showing and being directly installable in the Play Store on devices that are rooted and/or running a custom ROM, as well as on emulators and uncertified devices (think Meizu and its not-so-legal way of getting Play Services and the Play Store on its phones). This is exactly what many of you were afraid would happen after the Play Store app started surfacing a Device certification status. This is different from the full SafetyNet API implementation that apps like Android Pay and Pokémon Go use. In the case of Pay/Go, the attestation check happens when the app is installed on your phone and doesn't allow it to run unless it passes the integrity test. But in the case of the Play Console, the attestation check happens when you're browsing the Play Store and only affects the availability of the app for your device. If the full SafetyNet API isn't included in the app itself, you will still be able to grab the APK from other sources, install it, and the app will work just fine. Still, this spells trouble for rooted users and the Android enthusiast community as a whole. Google keeps erecting more and more obstacles each day in the face of root and custom ROMs and even if this won't stop root users who should be knowledgable enough to know how/where to grab an APK and install it, it will make things more and more difficult and maybe less and less worth the trouble. But y'all are rebels and you'll keep on finding a way around it, won't you?

Nice move Google. Suicide_Note Not sure if serious, but either way, this was just a matter of time. YouNex Obviously not serious EowynCarter So, question : Is there anyway to get android O in the future on my nexus 6 and not having problems with this ? IF manufacturer where taking care of updating their devices, wouldn't be an issue... saf1927 If Magisk keeps working, yep. You can. Even my old Nexus 5 is on 7.1.2 and it passes SafetyNet. EowynCarter I want "just work" stuff. Not workaround. Maybe Magisk does the job for some, but not an acceptable solution from my point of view. Mainly the "we don't know if it will keep on working" part. saf1927 Well, it's the best solution so far and it has improved a lot since its inception. I never bothered since the Nexus 5 was a secondary device for me, but now that some apps won't show up anymore on the Play Store, I simply flashed Magisk and that's about it. I haven't tweaked anything. Plus, if you are already flashing a custom ROM, flashing an extra zip file isn't that much work anyway. EowynCarter True, but it's the phone I use dailly. I don't want apps sudendly not working, becasue google decided to push an update that broke magisk. mxwp well if you want things to "just work" then i guess get an iPhone EowynCarter Sadly, I'm beginning to think about that. But that would cause others frustrations. ED-Zが現れた! Well, people will just flock to root-supported apps... Milton P. I actually forgot when was the last time I Rooted a device. No biggie. Suicide_Note The bad thing is it isn't just root that causes problems. Simply unlocking the bootloader will produce the same result. Maxr1998 Just because it's no biggie for you, it doesn't mean everyone approves this. I am actually pretty concerned, because this limits the freedom over our devices even more.. Milton P. Define freedom, please. Maxr1998 Software freedom, to be more specific. You should have the freedom to use and modify your device and it's software however you'd like, and have fill control over it. That means, root access. And since the AOSP core IS free software, the 4 freedoms defined by Richard Stallman apply to it. What this change now introduces is that you're forced to decide between either giving up the freedom over your device or not using the app you wanted to download (which will probably have to be my choice, and that sucks). Milton P. But you're not giving up anything, you just have to make a choice. If you put that way, Google has the freedom of doing with the AOSP core whatever they want, the same way you can modify said core and do as you please, the difference is Google has more money and more responsibilities when it comes to their user base. XDA and other sites will still have a bunch of developers making whatever they please (within the AOSP terms) with the AOSP core. This will just change thinks for the people that use those ROMs bit realistically the vast majority of users won't feel the changes. Sad but true. h4rr4r That choice is giving up freedom you had before. The vast majority will see the rate of Android improvements slow as the Devs on XDA and the like lose interest. Android only exists because of Linux, now it is turning its back on that whole culture. Milton P. Well, I don't see your freedom compromised to be honest with you, but we're seeing things from different angles so that's that. Sorry for your loss in that case. h4rr4r You do not think losing control of your device is a loss of freedom? Milton P. Nope, is just a device, I have more important stuff going on, m device is a tool the same way a hammer is a tool, you can buy a hammer and use it as it is. Sometimes my device is a toy, if I buy a remote control car I'll modify it as long as it is possible, the same way I modify my phone. I have control over my phone. I can install whatever I want at my own risk. If I decide to root my phone I expect things to be broken. I remember when I had an HTC and I hated sense so I decided to install a custom ROM, I gave up the camera and I was aware of it. There was always some compromises with custom ROMs, nothing is changing. I rather have a safe device then a compromised one today, still my choice thou. h4rr4r So you want IOS. Got it. Over here I want freedom. I don't think homedepot should be allowed to tell me what I can hit with the hammer I bought. trparky Open platforms rarely stay open once they become popular. Once the Benjamins come rolling in it tends to override open. h4rr4r Tell that to Linus Torvalds. I am sure he will have many many fuck yous for you. trparky Linux is the rare situation. h4rr4r The rare situation like many others that created android and even google. trparky Yeah but look at Android, the walls are closing around it and there's nothing you can do about it. Face it man, the geeks may have built the system but the common man now rules it. Geeks love choice, yes, they do love their choice but your average person doesn't give a rat's ass about choice. All they want is a device that does what they need it to do when they want to do it. They have no inclination to learn how it works or why it works just as long as it does. This is what geeks do not and refuse to understand. h4rr4r Sure there is, stop using it. Then the common folks will have to follow us to the next platform. trparky As long as their is money involved in maintaining Android it doesn't matter if something better comes along, people will continue supporting Android because it makes them money. Money makes the world go round, get used to it. Maxr1998 ^ What @h4rr4r:disqus says. trparky Yep. The root and ROM community is such a small portion of the Android ecosystem that they really don't matter to them. People have been screaming at Google for years to get the Android house fixed up, this is them doing just that. You can't blame them for doing what the people have asked for. mxwp I agree with you, but sadly you only have freedom over hardware. You can do what you want with the device you buy. But with software you never actually buy it... you only buy a license to use it. Thus you have no real freedom with software. Maxr1998 Android is free software, Apache 2.0 license. At least the AOSP part of it. trparky But the Google parts of it are not covered under the Apache 2.0 license. That's essentially why ROM developers can't package the Google Play Services pack with the ROM itself and instead requires you to download a separate ZIP package from Google to install it separate from the ROM package. Android itself may be free and open but the Google Play Services part is not. Sudev There are far more than few arguments against root access but here are some: Root access is meant for experimental & development purpose and not for Daily Driver for any average user of the platform. Google Play Services & Apps available on Play Store are not "Free Software". Google as provider of Play Services infrastructure has much more liabilities then one can simply assume. And also the app developers have responsibility to protect end users' data. If device has root access available and any rouge app / maleware steals other apps data which is possible, who will be at stack? h4rr4r The ability to do anything I want with my things that I own. Milton P. You​ can do whatever you want with your device, nobody is stopping you. You might see that some apps are not showing up in the play store but you can still side load them, I still see freedom in your future. h4rr4r For how much longer? Soon these apps will ask play services if they are supposed to be installed on that device, at that point you can say goodbye to sideloading. If this is what people want then IOS was the platform for them. thecoolkid Ok Google, define freedom... 😁 Nick I would imagine a great deal of people on this site will be upset, but in actuality I don't think this will affect the user base of many apps that badly h4rr4r Not in the short term. However in the long term it will. Android only exists because of the FREE software movement. Nick Yes, but that doesn't apply to applications, which this is about. h4rr4r Think long term. Same thing applies. trparky No it won't because the root and ROM community is so small it doesn't matter to Google anymore. The 95% of people who simply want a device that works don't care and likely won't ever care. As long as they can play NetFlix, Pokemon Go, or whatever is the next craze they don't care. h4rr4r Again, that is short term thinking. Think past the end of your nose. Android exists because of linux. Google needs this small group to create the very stuff they rely on. trparky You overestimate the value that the community has now. Android may have needed the community back in the beginning to gain the foothold that it has in the market but not so anymore. Android has near 100% market penetration, they have achieved world domination. They don't need the community anymore, they have achieved their goals. h4rr4r Until they are unseated. IBM once had a monopoly on computing devices. They did not need the community to gain a foothold, they would not have a product to gain a foothold without the community. Android only exists because of a collection of those projects. trparky No, Android exists because Samsung, HTC, and LG make devices people want and it makes them money by the semi-truck full. The community doesn't mean shit now, all that matters to these companies is one thing... money, money, and more money. Oh, and did I mention money? This is capitalism man, money rules the world. If you don't make money you are dead. h4rr4r Please tell me how that would have happened without linux. Money loses to good engineering every day. Look at how linux killed solaris. trparky Tell me why Windows is the defacto monopoly on the desktop despite the fact that Linux is better in every damn way possible under the hood? That's right... money. h4rr4r Because the desktop is dead. The fight is over. They lost. Even money can't keep them relevant. trparky Oh, you're funny. The desktop is not dead, it will never be dead. When people need to do real work, they sit down at a desktop. When people want to play real games, they sit down at a desktop. When people need to type out anything longer than a page like a college term paper, they sit down at a desktop. The desktop is king and will always be king. Long live the desktop! h4rr4r The Desktop is a dead man walking. When they do real work, they use a Citrix session. When they game they use a console, or they are already nerds. When people type they can use a fucking chromebook. The desktop as you think of it died already. trparky Try and say that shit over at TechPowerUp, HardOCP, Overclock.net, TomsHardware, etc. and trust me when I say this... you'll be run out of town by people with pitchforks and torches. h4rr4r Those are all nerds. Those are the folks who have desktops running 3 different OSes. They are the folks who are pissed about android being locked down. trparky And your point being? You just admitted that only the "nerds" care about Android being open. Sure, those same "nerds" will go off and create a new platform but the rest of the people who are living in the real world and who don't care one damn bit about how it works will continue to use Android. h4rr4r Those people will eventually move to the new platform. Just like they did with Android. trparky And the same thing will happen to that platform in the future that's happening to Android now. Open platforms are nice and all, I'll admit that, but your average person doesn't care one bit. I dare you to go up to any person on the street and ask them anything about Android. What phone do they have? What model? Most will say "I don't know, something that my carrier gave me for cheap." h4rr4r The wheel of computing we call it. It has happened and will happen again. So what? trparky Which reinforces the idea that I said before, eventually all open systems will become closed (or less open) at some point in their life cycle. It usually happens when it becomes popular with the common man. Why? Because like I've been trying to get through your thick skull, the average person doesn't care how any of this stuff works so long as it works. h4rr4r The average person does not matter. Few open systems become closed. AOSP is still fine. trparky What the hell do you mean by "they don't matter"? They're the ones buying the devices, buying the apps, looking at the ads, etc. Just how the fuck does that translate to "they don't matter"? h4rr4r Because they don't. They don't create, they don't cause new things to be created. They are just users, just like I don't matter to how movies are created. trparky But without money from the people who are consuming said things developers won't make new stuff. Developers do have to eat you know and put a roof over their heads. h4rr4r The giant world of FOSS pretty much proves you wrong. Demand cannot create supply. I don't pirate anything kiddo. I have way too much to lose for that. One of those lawsuits I would actually have to pay, since I could. trparky I'll give a hint on how FOSS works a lot of the time. Some of the top tier Linux kernel developers actually work for companies and they just contribute code in their free time. They may work for Intel, AMD, nVidia, or God knows what but only after their day job is done. Why? Because they need money and they need to eat. This is a basic requirement for people in this world. They need money!!! People don't just write code for the love of it, even Linus Torvalds who's in charge of the Linux kernel itself works for the Linux Foundation and yes, he gets paid for his work to the tune of $10 Million a year. Sorry to burst your bubble man but FOSS projects aren't all happy, happy, joy, joy here... people need to be paid real money to be able to eat, drive a car, put a roof over their heads, etc. On second thought, I'm not sorry I burst your bubble! You need it burst! PEOPLE NEED TO BE PAID REAL FUCKING MONEY!!!! h4rr4r No, they get paid to contribute. During the work day. Not as a hobby. Lots of projects are like that. I won't say exactly how I know about that ;) Their employers just aren't as short sighted as you. Linus did not however create linux to get rich. Great code like great art gets created because it must be. People do what they love. Kid, you will get it one day. When you have enough that you aren't worried about it each day, money stops being that big of a deal. Don't worry everybody goes through a phase like you are now. trparky Dude, we are not the Federation of Planets here living in a happy, happy, joy, joy world in which people can just do whatever they want to do without a care in the world. As long as human greed exists there will always be a need for money. And believe you me, greed will never go away unless we breed a new kind of human and I don't see that happening any time soon. Gene Roddenberry's future will never happen, it just won't. Contrary to a lot of geek dreams it just won't. h4rr4r No idea where you got that idea. Never suggested it. My point was the personal relative value of increasing income drops as income goes up. If you make minimum wage doubling your income is a huge deal. Adding the same amount to my income would not get me to take a job I like less. Offering it to Linus would be a waste of time. Yes, some people will keep chasing dollars, they are the exception not the rule. The employers are working on enlightened self interest. Either they use the FOSS product, gain market advantage with direct knowledge, use it for marketing or believe they are getting something else. PostgreSQL for example has a lot of paid contributors who work for companies that either provide customization, consulting or depend on the project. Others just because it increases quality. Commercial software by and large is not high quality. I have seen a lot of it and 90% if you tried to submit it to a FOSS project of any size would get you denied and possibly mocked. This system continues to be more innovative because it is easy to continue to expand. Anyone with a good idea can fork if their idea is not accepted. trparky > My point was the personal relative value of increasing income drops as income goes up. Tell that to the people in Washington or any CEO that demands ever increasing yearly salaries and end of year bonuses all while raping the companies that they work for. Tell that to the psychopaths on Wall Street. For as long as their is money, people will want more of it. Anyone who says that they don't is flat out lying. h4rr4r Those are the exception not the rule. That is why you call them psychopaths. Honestly, correcting for inflation I really don't care that much if I ever make more. Would it be nice sure, would I give up anything I like about my job? No. If you could double my income but it prevented me from contributing to FOSS projects or owning code I generate off the clock, I would not take that deal. If money was enough to make people do anything MS would have offered Linus $11 million a year to not write it. Heck, Sun would have done it while they were still around. trparky Either you're a child that doesn't know how the adult world works or you're a fucking troll. h4rr4r So you have no idea who makes stuff, neat. I guess you think Henry Ford should have made a faster horse. trparky Oh, I know who makes the stuff I use but I also make sure that they are paid! I give money to those developers who write the programs that I enjoy and if I can't pay them I won't use their programs. I only use a program if I can pay for it. I have put money into their tip jars on their web site, I look for PayPal links and I donate even if it's something small like $5. They deserve it! h4rr4r Good for you! There is a lot of great software that does not make money that way. Some even just ask is that you follow the license, like linux which mediatek steals by not releasing kernel source. So I hope you avoid buying that kind of thing. trparky MediaTek controller chips are known to suck so I don't buy them out of that reason alone. h4rr4r Now I have given you another good reason to avoid them. Bunch of thieves. Rita El Khoury I don't even remember when I last bootloader unlocked. But I know this move toward closing the ecosystem further and further will have ripples in the future. The enthusiast community flocked toward Android for its openness and we have custom ROMs and their enterprising devs to thank for HUNDREDS of new features that they implemented first and everyone clamored for and applauded until they became features in AOSP. If Google thinks it can steer this ship alone and it knows best what to do next, we may have less and less interesting features in the future and more and more of what only one entity thinks is best, not a diverse set of opinions. Nick Given that this only gives the developer the option of requiring these checks, it makes me believe that Google had to do this for some companies that have regulatory or other kinds of requirements. Which is a shame for the rooted (and unlocked?) community, but understandable. Shame Google is most likely going to take the blame here in this comment section though. Rita El Khoury Well, maybe they had to, but that won't stop any developer from implementing it without any regulatory or legal requirement pushing them to do so. Nick Right, which puts this choice on the developer, not Google. Google was stuck behind a rock and hard place, perhaps. EowynCarter Well, google is certainly to blame for not planing to update my nexus 6 to android O. And now I can't even use custom rom as plan B without losing some apps :( Suicide_Note Boo hoo. Buy a new phone and quit crying that Google doesn't support phones forever. EowynCarter Fine can you order a pixel XL and ship it to me in France ? Plus, my nexus 6 still works, I hate having to replace working stuff. Makes no sense, economically and ecologically speaking. Suicide_Note I'll sell you my XL when I'm done with it, but only after i get the Pixel XL 2. :) EowynCarter Well, I do hope Google sells the "pixel 2 "( or whatever its name) here. For now, I'm'just hoping my nexus 6 don't break. Else I might jump on the iOS ship. I'm not convinced the the other android alternatives. Note 8 would be the closest, but touchwiiz, delayed updates.... I'm spoiled after a few years with a nexus. Suicide_Note There always eBay or Swappa if you want to get a first gen Pixel. I was looking at prices over the weekend, and mint condition Pixels are going for about $450. EowynCarter Not so much in France. And eBay for suff that cost more that a few bucks, too risky. Plus, the pixel is getting "old" by now. Wilton Daniel Pinto Troll found trparky Yet Microsoft still supports Windows 7 EIGHT YEARS LATER! How come Microsoft can do that yet Google can't? Alex Louderback Actually, that's Qualcomm EowynCarter Source for this ? trparky And Qualcomm can go fuck themselves. Gee... I wonder why they're being hit with an anti-trust lawsuit. Could this be one of many reasons why? trparky Yes, Google is to blame for that. There's no damn reason why your Nexus 6 can't run Android O other than the fact that they just don't want to. Bojan Bunić My bootloader was unlocked prior to changing the mobo on my 5X, courtesy of Booty Loops. Root, well, probably before I got my Nexus 4. Although I'll see how it'll go on in the future, as we don't have Pixels here, so the only near stock possibility is either OnePlus, or some other device and a custom ROM. Milton P. Agree 100% with you, I mean I remember the old days when I hated HTC's Sense, I literally decided that a phone without a camera was better than whatever HTC did back then, but Android has evolved quite a lot nowadays, don't get me wrong, I do believe that custom ROMs did a great job showing Google what the users want but that won't change, as long as someone shows Google what people want Google will keep improving Android, because there's no limits. Now if they go the Apple way and lock EVERYTHING then we'll be fucked, I'm the meantime developers will find a way around the system pushing Google along. Premsuraj An open bootloader and root actually solves a lot of problems still existing in AOSP. The Nougat update absolutely destoryed the battery life of many Nexus 6P devices, with Google only focussing on the Pixels, there was no fix in it. I unlocked, used Franco Kernel + naptime + Greenify and I now I get adequate battery life. Another feature I can think of is theming. Material design is good, but the whiteness is rage inducing Maxr1998 Well, fuck them. Let's just hope not many devs will use this, and Google won't enable this by default anytime soon. Maxr1998 The more I think about this, the more concerned I get. This will reduce the freedom over our devices, and also limit developers in the awesome things they could do before because of Android's openness. I am all in for device security and fighting against malware, trojans and phishing applications, don't understand me wrong, but that doesn't mean that you have to take people away their freedom - just look at how Linux (GNU and Linux) is doing it. Tom Westrick How does this limit developers? If anything it gives them more control. Maxr1998 Fair point, I should have been more specific. With "developers", I meant rom developers and modders, app developers only if they require root access for their apps. "Normal" developers can use this to enforce a "secure" (read: DRM locked-down) environment, but that's not really a good thing in my opinion.. (Refer to my other comments.) trparky You're angry at the wrong people, you should be angry at Hollywood; they're the ones that are demanding this kind of stuff. Their content, their rules; it's how things are in the real world. They have to do what they need to do to protect their investments, plain and simple. We don't necessarily have to like it, hell... we may even hate it, but that's how it is. You want the content? Play by their rules. Colin Richardson If you are an app developer and want your app to run on custom roms..... don't turn on "Requires SafetyNet"... bekifft We are increasingly living in the future Richard Stallman warned us about. With Google taking all these steps, may as well go back to using jailbroken iPhones. Bart Janusz I've already enabled it and I know at least 3 others devs that did it as well. I really don't care about root per se, but custom roms and xposed is source of countless problem as both are buggy as hell. Maxr1998 But in which way does that influence you? Xposed can introduce bugs to the system, sure, but it won't affect the performance of your app unless it itself is modded, so you probably don't have to fear bad reviews for bad performance anyway. And custom roms? LineageOS on my mother's Moto G runs like a champ and much better than the 5.1 stock rom before. And in my experience as a dev, there were much more incompatibilities with Samsung TouchWiz than with AOSP-based custom roms. refthemc I'm sure he's just trying to avoid the headache of emails he gets daily from users who have no idea that it's their fault the app is not working or crashing... Bart Janusz Indeed, not to mention extra crash and ANRs reports which seems to influence app positioning. Maxr1998 But why? The device may behave more buggy at some parts because of Xposed (and mine definitely ran like shit on MM because of some mods, but I NEVER blamed any apps), but the apps itself won't run worse if not modded - normally they should even run better if you only use performance mods like Greenify, NLP Collector wakelock disabler and other light mods. I don't think he gets many reports anyway, considering what @marcusmarcus2:disqus said. Bart Janusz You may not, but many users do, and as I said there are a lot of bogus ANRs and crash reports. Since my app depends heavily on low level OS elements both custom ROMs and xposed are deal breakers (and you really should check source, since I do not update my website as I moved to G+/FB but app has sizable user base given its niche and I'd to deal with ROM/xposed issues fequently). Maxr1998 Well, but the same type of users also give bad reviews etc. without using any mod or root. You generalize modders to only cause problems, and therefore lock out everyone. About your app/website thing: fair point, I didn't look at it yet, and have to apologize for being a little rude. marcusmarcus2 You need to take your own advice, "you really should check source". If you moved to G+/FB, then why does your app on the play store still point to the same website as well. Or at least put a link on the old website that directs to G+/FB. There is nothing that points to your so called G+/FB source. So @Maxr1998:disqus has no other source to check at the moment. Bart Janusz Not that I care but if you try to draw conclusion about app you should probably visit Play Store listing. Anyhow that's really not important I just chimed in to explain why developer will use this. I've choose to do so due to extra burden which in effect hurts majority of my user base, one of my colleagues cited lucky patcher and freedom (which I think is not such a good idea but its his choice). trparky You may not blame the apps because you know better but most people don't understand that, most people see a crashing app and suddenly you see, as the developer, a ton of comments saying that your app sucks. h4rr4r Please do tell us about your apps so we can be sure to avoid them on any devices we have not yet rooted. marcusmarcus2 His disqus profile leads to this website http://artflowstudio.com/ which has a few apps listed. Art oriented apps. There is only 1 update on that website since 2014, so I don't think I would be to concerned about installing one of his apps. Jordan Palmer Nice detective work. Adrian I can see a lot of refund requests coming from people who paid for apps and suddenly are told "Nope. Not for you anymore." A lot of us are rooted and buy apps and you'd better believe noise will be made if an app I use daily, that I paid for, suddenly breaks with an update because it's no longer blessed by the dev to run on my device. It's your app and you can do what you want with it, but there is always another side to the coin. BAlGaInTl That's not the way that Netflix worked it, and I doubt other developers of paid apps would either. I have a OnePlus One, that I run Lineage OS on since the original Cyanogen OS is now defunct and does not receive any updates. Netflix simply doesn't update to v 5+. It still works just fine. I may not get the newest and latest features, but part of that is on me for using a device that is dated. I'm not one of those users who, because I paid for an app once, fells that I should get all of the updates from now until the end of time. That isn't sustainable for developers. It could very well be that Netflix has some new features/offerings in the works in which they are getting pressure from outside sources to push this. A lot of valid reasons for a developer to enable the check exist. As long as they do it in the same manner that Netflix has, I don't see the issue. Adrian And just like Pokemon Go, eventually you'll get a message that you need to upgrade to the latest version or the app won't work, you know, that new version that won't let you actually log into it anymore. We've already seen this happen so let's not pretend that it isn't the next logical step. They aren't going to keep letting people sign in indefinitely with an app that doesn't have the security level they want. It's naive to think that hey I can just stick with the last version that works for root. It takes all of what, the time it takes to create a switch that says minimum version required to log in is "DRM version" BAlGaInTl Good Point. I recognize that. But it seems that the blame (in general) is being directed at Google in many of these posts. If that scenario happens, it isn't Google that blocked you from accessing Netflix. The need for this level of security is on the increase. The same users demanding better security and longer updates are the first ones to cry foul when Google starts laying the groundwork for exactly what they have asked for. Adrian I think there is a way to do both that doesn't piss off a very active community that helped take Android from a very very very ugly, second class OS to what we have now. I know a lot of us remember just how crippled Android was and it was the root/mod community that produced the bulk of what is now standard on Android. There needs to be a way to secure the devices AND not turn their back on the developer community that contributes. The idea, in Netflix's case, that root = pirate is insane. Why in the world would someone prefer to rip content on their phone to say a computer or XBox that is never going to move and can do it while you get on with your life? They're doing something for the sake of saying they're doing something, but if they think it's going to make a dent in piracy they, and the studios are nuts. I watch a lot of Netflix and still prefer to buy discs. People who do things the right way and are perfectly happy paying for content shouldn't have to jump through hoops to watch it. Those of us who root usually have a handful of things that stock Android is not doing for us. It's why we root. If all of these things were available in stock, my reasons for rooting would disappear but I don't see that happening any time soon. I think Android is getting so much better but if they make it exactly like iOS, might as well go to the dark side because Apple's apps tend to be more polished, come out first and OS updates are frequent. Don't bite the hand that feeds you just because you're getting more popular. BAlGaInTl I think that Netflix is a good example. It is HIGHLY likely that the reason for recent unpopular changes (see also VPN blocking) are being driven by other entities. It isn't that Netflix thinks its a problem, but the people that control a large portion of their content do. root pirate but it does introduce a security risk. I don't see how Google is turning their backs on developers. Developers are free to develop as they see fit and choose (at least for the moment) whether or not they will implement the SafetyNet check. The inherent problem is that a circumvented security is still circumvented and can no longer be considered secure. I can clearly see why some apps would and should frown upon that. Maybe not Netflix and Mario (IMHO), but certainly something like bank and payment apps. I don't think the inherent open nature of android will ever reduce to the level of iOS. But some changes have to occur to meet the needs/desire of the majority. Security is inherently difficult. The easier and more flexible you try to make it, the less secure it becomes. Adrian I do think banking apps should run in a secure space. Completely agree with that, but I disagree with root = less secure. My nexus devices stopped getting OS and security updates. Nothing. VERY insecure and dangerous. I rooted them, updated the OS with images from XDA developers and my devices that were once easy targets are more secure. There is always two sides to it. I see that Google is finally trying to take security seriously on Android and doing things in layers that completely cut out the vendor AND the carriers is the right step. Right now, Root is the only way to update a perfectly good device like my Nexus tablet tablet that the vendor said "oh well" to. Until Google has a REAL strategy in place to keep ALL Android devices secure, root will be necessary. Not everyone wants to or can upgrade devices every two years because they get abandoned. My father doesn't need an S8. He does need a device that gets security updates for more than a year after purchasing his phone. BAlGaInTl You are exactly correct, and I'm in the same situation with my OnePlus One. But in working to increase your security level, you leave holes behind. The key words that you used are "more secure." I agree. You are "more secure." But still (probably) less secure than a device that has been thoroughly tested, certified, and passes SafetyNet without hacks. Google has been open that they are working on security updates. They have improved significantly over the last couple years in getting those out. I feel that they are putting in place a real strategy to keep Android devices secure. This is part of that groundwork. I also feel that they are actively looking to replace Android in it's current state, and I can't say I blame them. The only real strategy may be to take lessons learned and start over. Lucky for them, they have the resources to do so. trparky > take lessons learned and start over Pretty much. The worst thing that they did from the very beginning was to allow for the OEMs to do what they wished. Google essentially made a deal with the devil when they released Android to the world. They wrote no requirements into the Android agreements that the OEMs agreed to to require updates to be a necessary thing. Big mistake Google. BAlGaInTl The really needed to in order to get their foot in the door of the market. If it would not have been open source from the beginning, none of the major manufactures would have bought off on it. The fact that they could use it for free (essentially) and still be able to customize on top of it is what sold it. trparky And now look at it, Android is a fucking mess of non-updated insecure devices that are ripe for anyone to be able to take over and turn into a botnet. trparky And you should be raising holy hell with the OEM that made that device! Just because your device is old doesn't mean that it shouldn't still be supported. Windows 7 is nearly eight years old and it still receives Windows Updates. Why can't your device? BAlGaInTl Normally, I would agree, but the OnePlus One is a special case. The OEM operating system is the now defunct Cyanogen OS. I had to balance having the original OS without updates, or running another with updates. The phone is now almost three years old. If I bought a PC with Windows on it three years ago, and Microsoft had since gone out of business, should the PC manufacturer be responsible for providing Windows 7 updates? Even though the PC is beyond it's support date? Sure, I can increase the security by switching to another OS that is updated. It may even be a Windows clone. But if a software developer decided to only support "original, unmodified" PC configurations, that would be within their right. trparky But it can be adapted to run LineageOS. Sudev There is bit difference in analogy here: OnePlus manufactured the phone and Cynogen Inc customized AOSP Android OS for it, they didn't developed it from ground up. I understand that Cynogen INC is out of business now too. However in PC world, it would be the case that you purchased a PC from Dell and get Microsoft Windows OS with some additional Dell software. If Dell or developer of that custom software goes out of business you still get OS update for your PC. Its not android OS itself out business here. Adrian and for the record, I absolutely agree that it was the content providers and not all on Netflix. trparky You should be demanding that OnePlus send an official update to your device. So what if your device is old? It should be still supported. Windows 7 is still supported nearly eight years later, why can't your device be supported for that long as well? Plumplam Who cares except for a bunch of XDA nerds? If it means better security then I'm all for it. Dmitri Smirnov Well, for starters, it doesn't mean better security, since it does nothing to address the problems with vulnerable outdated android versions that will be "certified", but will allow malicious apps to quietly escalate their privileges and do their dirty work, but will block "uncertified" custom roms that actually have all the recent secuirity patches and give user full control over who has root access and how. Also, "bunch of XDA nerds" are the source of a lot of features that had their trial run in custom ROMs and then were adopted to the AOSP. Should I remind you of "The Oak and the Pig" fable? Alienate the developers bringing new ideas to the ecosystem - lose the competetive edge you had over other OSes saf1927 Actually, custom ROMs never really have the latest security patches despite what they claim since kernels aren't maintained and no proprietary blobs is updated anymore. If ROM developers were OEMs, they'd be violating their agreements with Google by bumping the patch level without actually addressing all the vulnerabilities. Dmitri Smirnov Well they patch the AOSP to the same level as latest official one and kernel - if it's possible to do so without breaking the compatibility with compiled blobs or at least on the level of latest official firmware. So in the end run it's at least as secure as the official firmware, often - much more so. saf1927 If you look at the security bulletin, most vulnerabilities come from proprietary drivers and require these to be updated. On a supported device, these are provided by the chip manufacturers to the OEMs, on an unsupported device they aren't updated anymore. A custom ROM can only fix userspace security issues. In the end, bumping the patch level without addressing all vulnerabilities in that patch gives a false sense of security to users. Dmitri Smirnov If anything, this is an argument for forcing OEMs to opensource their blobs. For some reason community is much better at releasing the fixes for what they can change (userspace), while OEMs generally stop caring as soon as device is out the door. saf1927 The problem goes beyond OEMs unfortunately. All the phones you can buy are assembled with off-the-shelf components that they buy from other manufacturers and it is them that provide the binary blobs to the OEMs. If they stop supporting components, the OEMs can't do anything. For the chip, it's companies like Qualcomm, Samsung, Mediatek etc. that need to support it with up-to-date drivers. Once they stop, the life-cycle of a phone comes to an end. trparky And that is probably one of many reason why Qualcomm is facing a nice fat anti-trust lawsuit. Serves them right. trparky That ain't ever going to happen. There's no way they're going to allow for their intellectual property to be open for all the world to see and have it cracked open. It would be corporate suicide since their competitors would be able to reverse engineer their stuff. Suicide_Note Never heard of "The Oak and the Pig" before. Could you tell me more? Seriously. Dmitri Smirnov http://www.aliceswonderland.eu/Alice-ska350-en.html Maxr1998 Ah, Lessing. Going to read the original version in a minute :) username_not_valid Thats a very generous view of the custom ROM community. It might be true of a few, very few devs, but most ROMs are unsupported garbage with serious security issues. Dmitri Smirnov Maybe so, but out of this cesspool of garbage CyanogenMod was born, which became LineageOS. I'd say their quality standard appeals me more than a lot of OEMs. username_not_valid Cyanogen and Lineage was what i had in mind.. Each to his own i guess. BAlGaInTl Yes and no. I run Lineage on my OnePlus One because Cyanogen OS is no longer supported. I can say with certainty that Lineage introduces stability issues that I have to deal with to be up to date. Wilton Daniel Pinto Ninna pooty bewarci Qwip Consider the bigger picture. Right now, users are being shuffled into a situation where they must restrict the control they have over their device if they want to be able to use Netflix (and presumably banking apps will follow soon). That may seem fine, and from some security perspective it is probably a good thing. How much control do you have over your _laptop_? How much do you want? Right now, we're blissfully able to install unsigned software on our computers (although various OSs will complain about it), but will that last? How long will it be before we can only open our banking interface on our laptop using a trusted, digitally signed browser on a machine that is using secure boot and can only run signed binaries? I can understand the direction that Netflix (and others) are coming from, and to them it may even make sense. The question is: what is the cost of ceding control over our devices/machines in order to be able to watch netflix, etc. trparky Yeah and that's why Windows is the virus filled cesspool that it is today. Windows 10 is slowly changing Windows to be an app store based ecosystem in which all apps will be sandboxed. It's coming to the desktop near you. saf1927 I hope Magisk (or other similar mods in the future) keep working, so to prevent this. Not a problem on my Pixel XL since I haven't rooted it, but on my Nexus 5 Magisk allows it to pass Safety Net even though it's running a custom ROM (7.1.2) and it's rooted. Hendrik Leppkes SafetyNets primary purpose is to secure devices for Android Pay, and when you deal with actual money transactions on your device, you really don't want any hack interfering with it - so I'm quite certain they'll do whatever they can to break hacks like this and ensure the security and integrity of the device. h4rr4r No, its primary purpose is to make the device trustworthy for others not the person who paid for it. This is how it makes it "secure" for android pay. You are a possible threat and this closes that. Suicide_Note It would seem that Google is erecting a wall around their garden, too. EowynCarter While Apple opens iOS more and more. YouNex According to the support/help page, a device is not certified if it stops getting Android updates. How fuck up is that ? I don't get it. My Moto X has always been on stock ROM, yet it's showing up as non certified. Yes it's rooted + system modifications, but at no point is it stated that root prevents it from being certified. Suicide_Note Really? You can't understand why your rooted/system modified device is non-certified? YouNex I know how to read, but this is vague https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/b6f710b8628f0e09ab73ba144c133a2c9b1fe1325b353ae7dc1636f2776b2ac0.png "Not secure" jonzey231 Root and/or unlocked bootloader = Not certified. YouNex It says nothing about root or bootloader https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/b6f710b8628f0e09ab73ba144c133a2c9b1fe1325b353ae7dc1636f2776b2ac0.png ast00 Can't wait until LastPass excludes root users... Fuck them. Adonis K. If they do, I'm cancelling my subscription... Naxx ENVY Fuck them and yet they haven't done anything yet ... #internetlogic Also i know right , crazy for a company that stores your passwords to make themselves more secure . ABSOLUTE CRAZY , RAGE RAGE RAGE Jordan Palmer I don't understand your reasoning or rationale for these two statements. ast00 The second part is related to Google. Sorry about the confusion. Believe it or not, most of us root users keep SELinux in it's Enforcing state. This means we are safe. Nothing gets root rights without us knowing. Our phones are just as safe if not safer than most stock phones. JATIN BANSAL SafetyNet test can be passed using Magisk Manager. I am using it and it works fine for me. Even in play store, my device is certified. May be this helps someone. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/3756499ff5876545740cd0e88e38961bb2c327d90fc43f5801f4bce5d802c990.png https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/44185f640490cb506a68a3414579bd345123f7d52ee2e11802d31d5141db11ae.png Nick Most people are worried about the future when the exploits that Magisk uses are patched and it continues to make it harder for people to get around this. JATIN BANSAL That's what I am also worried about. I just posted this for those who are already rooted and for now want to keep the root. My main purpose of rooting was to flash lineage OS. I think custom rom is the only way of staying updated to latest version of Android as google itself doesn't update their phones after 2 years (18 months I think) for reasons they have. I think if someone buys a flagship device which costs 700$+, it should have 3-4 years of full software update support. 😆😄 2 years of major OS version updates and 3 years of security patches. After 3 years, its time to buy a new phone cuz its so old anyway. trparky Says you! Windows 7 was released on July 22, 2009 and they still support it EIGHT YEARS LATER! And they plan on supporting it until the year 2020 which means it will be supported for a total of ELEVEN YEARS! If Microsoft can do it, Google can too!!! Does Microsoft suddenly say "Your machine is too old, go buy a new one"? No, they continue to give you Windows Updates for years later. We should also be demanding that the Android OEMs do so as well. A Samsung Note 5 has more than enough hardware in it to run Android 7 but no... we can't do that, we need to make money so we don't update them to force you to buy a new device. Lambdadelta Magisk...alright, thanks for the tip-off. I really must get it. TadMSTR Magisk doesn't always pass SafetyNet. I have some devices it fails on. However, several other devices it works just fine. Make sure you turn on the hide root option, it's off by default. Lambdadelta Well, I do have a problem, and that is my device is not able to download it directly from Google Play, so I have to get the APK from XDA. I dunno why this is the case for my phone though. Is it because it's a 4.4.4? Either way, I'll get the APK moved to my phone later tonight. Teodor Axel Johan Jönsson I have activated hide root option, and it passes SafetyNet, but in Google Play Store, it still shows uncertified. What app should I hide root from to get Play Store to show Certified? JATIN BANSAL As per XDA: Q: Safety Net fails after enabling MagiskHide A: Magisk can only hide Magisk core features, for Magisk modules it depends on what the module does. If your ROM itself is not able to pass SafetyNet, then there is nothing Magisk can help. Your best bet is 100% stock ROMs, because your phone manufacturer is forced to release a device passing CTS. Teodor Axel Johan Jönsson What in Magisk Hide did you check/how did you do it? Google Play Store? Or Play services? Because here it says uncertified :( JATIN BANSAL Just clear app data of play store. Now it will show your device certified Teodor Axel Johan Jönsson Thanks! Muzaffar I believe that root and custom rom makes android what it is now. This feels like betrayal for Android enthusiast. username_not_valid Well maybe in the very early days (maybe), but not any more. Rooted phones make up a tiny fraction of active devices. Muzaffar It's not about active devices. It's about how android develop together with community (well as i remember) I believe that those "rooted user" contribute many things that make android right now. I still remember status bar (and nav bar) color change was implemented on Kitkat before it becomes official on lollipop. Also, we can't forget how badly mobile active network bug happens in lollipop if it's not those "rooted user" who found out the fix via xposed. and i believe there are still more. trparky We can blame the OEMs for that kind of stuff because of things like locked bootloaders, eFuses, etc. username_not_valid Or we can blame ROM makers for it because they kept breaking the devices causing warranty claims. Naxx ENVY no offence but that's small thinking ... i'd say 90% of people on Android devices don't want or even know about root, heck it may even be 95% ... security is more of a concern, sure it annoys us geeks, but that's the 5% at most. Muzaffar And about half of android devices is left outdated. Not to mention bugs that unsolved on previous android. I'll pick a dumb phone instead, if android becomes a closed platform. trparky And truth be told that's why I have an iPhone. I simply got sick and tired of the lack of updates so I told myself I'm going to the iPhone and have been happy ever since. OK sure, it may not have all of the customization features that Android has but I can be guaranteed that I will get software and security updates on time, every time, regardless of my carrier of choice. refthemc I think you misread his comment, he's saying that root and custom roms got Android to where it is TODAY not saying that it is necessary TODAY. And I agree. trparky It pretty much comes down to this. Google is simply targeting a much larger piece of the pie. You can't blame them for trying to do what is necessary to protect not only the platform but the Android brand itself. Qwip Well, it isn't like there is anywhere else to go though, is it? Google can basically throw enthusiasts who have promoted and fostered android development under the bus - they don't need them any more. trparky Money trumps community. Always has, always will. username_not_valid Ad blocking was the last holdout reason to root for me, but even thats no longer a good reason with things like Adhell, Adguard etc I have no other reason to root now, custom ROMs are generally garbage, and bloat can usually be uninstalled or disabled, so its just not needed. Adonis K. custom ROMs have nothing to do with root... thevigilante Custom ROMs have uncertified flag in Play Store Mike Avellanosa Not all, though George Byers My Nexus 7 2013 is passing safteynet running Lineage unrooted. Wilton Daniel Pinto Let me guess, you have a Pixel. Or you wouldn't call custom ROMs bloated while the reality is other way round username_not_valid Wouldn't touch a Pixel actually. username_not_valid Should be noted that I didn't call custom ROMs bloated, I guess you misread it. Wilton Daniel Pinto Oh yeah, I misread it . My bad Zach Mauch This is going to cause the same problem I see in governments work with security. They will blindly block things like root and bootloader unlock regardless of if it poses any credible threat because it FEELS more secure. Blah!!!!!! Naxx ENVY it IS more secure, not just " feels" h4rr4r More secure for them, not for me the owner of the device. Besides, not even for them in the long term. An up to date ROM has many exploits patched that a two versions out of date and 12 months behind on security patches OTA has. Zach Mauch What I mean is they will apply restrictions because they easily can and it gives a warm fuzzy for them. They will do this regardless of the impact to the user. The analogy here is that in my job I am constantly unnecessary restrictions and bureaucracy that make doing my job much more difficult. For instance, we are disallowed from using remote desktop on standalone computer networks. It would make our job MUCH MUCH easier in many circumstances and save money on software as I could remote into my PC from anywhere in the building. Yet they deny us that and claim security. jonzey231 So this will force people to install apps from unauthorized sources, thus making the whole Android malware issue that much more prevalent. Great.. Suicide_Note Unless being held at gunpoint, no one is forced to install apps from unauthorized sources. That's a user's CHOICE. jonzey231 You know what I mean. Stop playing devil's advocate on everyone's posts. Eric Braun He's not incorrect. Kyle R Krcmaric "Stop providing an alternate viewpoint to my own." It's just comments. Anyway, I think Google also announced that even sideloaded apps will get scanned by their new Google Play Protect service, which may help nullify the risk of sideloading in the first place. d0x360 That's not an alternate viewpoint unless your view is "don't install any apps ever" There is no logical argument to defend this move by Google. None. username_not_valid Yes there is. Come content creators will not allow a provider to support a rooted or otherwise compromised device. Right or wrong in your eyes thats the reality, and in order for Android to be able to have such services Google have to do this. d0x360 What you said isn't an alternate viewpoint lol you are just repeating the reason Google is doing this which everyone agrees is a fact. As for this new comment...a rooted phone isn't compromised. Tell me...what would a rooted user do with Netflix that would make Netflix want to block them? Are they worried about people copying movies because if they think Android is the vector for that action they are idiots. All they are doing is making a problem by allowing bad actors to inject malware into a Netflix apk that could be installed by both root and unrooted users. Genius! Give me 1 good reason to block rooted phones from an app like oh I dunno, Mario run or whatever it's called. Any answers you give are false. Wanna know why? Hacked apks exist to allow cheating and they can be installed by anyone rooted or not. In fact I'd stake my life that your average unrooted user is installing more modified apk files to cheat in games or whatever than any rooted user. People who root are generally better educated about the Android eco system and do less dumb stuff. As for Netflix I cancelled my account on the day they did this and now I just use a friends account so they lost a subscriber due to this move and I rarely ever used the app. Sure 1 person closing an account that's existed since the day they opened isn't going to do much but I vote with my wallet and if a company does something I dislike then they simply don't get my money. The first person I asked gave me their login info and I made a profile. It's just like how I share my HBO subscription with someone else. Easy easy. username_not_valid See my previous comment. Its not for me to argue, the fact is content providers want it, fair or not, end of story, therefore its going to happen. The tiny number of rooters out there are meaningless to them, and Google. Netflix has to do this because the providers of its non-original content demand it. Its not Netflix fault, they either do it or lose shows. Losing large amounts of their content would affect their subscription base several orders of magnitude more than losing rooted users, who chances are, use the service on more than their phone or tablet anyway. d0x360 Once again I ask... what about a rooted device is dangerous to an app and also this is now a second question, what makes it compromised? BAlGaInTl Clearly you've made up your mind on the issue, but I'll give it a go. It isn't necessarily the root that is dangerous to an app or vice versa. The compromise comes from other apps/processes that can take advantage of root. If you don't understand that, then you don't understand what root really is. It has a lot of valuable uses, but it can also be dangerous. To address your previous statement, just because it rubs me the wrong way. So your "solution" was to cancel your Netflix account and then steal the content? So clearly, you aren't "actually" affected by the change, because you can still watch Netflix. You do realize that watching their content is also valuable to them and makes them money? If you want to boycott Netflix for their practices, then by all means do. Otherwise, it just comes across as hypocritical IMHO. d0x360 I don't believe I asked you. No I'm not stealing Netflix content, it's being paid for and Netflix has many times in the past encouraged account sharing. Of course they did so in the hopes you would join but they still allow it. I paid my Netflix dues. Day 1 4 disc member, then as soon as it was available I upgraded to the 4k 4 user package. It's not piracy either, I'm not recording or distributing the content. If Netflix wants to dick with me I'll dick with them. I never said this was permanent but I vote with my wallet. Vote cast. I also haven't used Netflix once since that day despite being able to. I've been using Amazon and Microsoft video where I own over 500 movies so you can stuff the whole theft argument. I've bought more content than most and that doesn't include my DVD, Blu-ray, and uhd Blu-ray collection which is well over 1400 movies and TV shows at this point. Your right...I've been rooting since the first Android phone but I totally don't understand the possibilities. My argument is simple. The overwhelming majority of root users don't mess with apps. To hell with that nonsense argument anyways. What is the danger to Netflix? Copying movies? Please...it's a million times easier to do it on a PC. Even windows xp can handle it without issue. Does Netflix and you I suppose really think root users are using the app to steal content? If so how? Show me one forum topic, one article, one modified Netflix apk that allows downloading and bypassing their drm. I'm begging you. Just 1. BAlGaInTl I reviewed the Netflix TOS, and I will agree that you are not stealing. I'll even remove the verbiage from my post. Netflix does not make any such stipulation. They speak only of the "Account Owner" and "Devices." I guess I just assumed that, and that's my bad. As I've said in other posts... It isn't all about Netflix. A large part of it is about their content. They really can't argue that point with providers. You either play by their rules, work to establish new rules, or choose not to carry them. Netflix wants to stay relevant on all platforms. That's the main danger to Netflix. In addition, I shouldn't have to give an example in the wild of an exploit. Just because it is difficult to find doesn't mean it doesn't exist. What if someone else writes an app that uses root to mine user account data from Netflix? Should Netflix not be worried about protecting user data? If that happens, who is responsible for the security and the bad press? Probably not Netflix, but they would certainly be impacted. I checked my app really quick (which is stuck on version 4 because I'm affected). Since Netflix keeps you logged in for convenience (that's spelled out in their terms), a quick look gives my full name, username, phone number, zip code, the brand of payment card, and the last 4 digits of that card. That's quite a bit of information that can easily be gathered by a piece of Malware. Now as I said... Netflix probably wouldn't be liable if a user was compromised because of root. It would certainly be a danger to their business however. Why should the be asked to take that risk? It seems to me that they are approaching this in a realistic manner, and rolling it out in a reasonable way. Would this affect the majority of root users? Probably not. By their nature, root users will find ways around it anyway. The problem is that the impact to Netflix from losing content and/or a compromised app is disproportionate the loss of blocking root users. It's simply a numbers game, and you can't blame Netflix for that. And you certainly can't blame Google who is trying to improve security. username_not_valid Thats not for me to decide, or argue, the fact is the content providers have decided that rooting is a risk to their copyrighted content, and as such services like Netflix, Amazon, and other streaming services must comply and lock out rooted devices. Passing safetynet and using Googles DRM framework is the easiest way to claim due diligence, so thats what they will do, and in order to keep Android competitive Google is providing the tools needed to make it possible. What I will argue though is that your notion that custom ROMs etc are more secure is unfounded. The best might well be, but there are hundreds of completely random and unchecked ROMs out there that could contain absolutely anything, you cant possibly claim that custom ROMs are inherently safer or more secure than OEM ROMs, outdated or not. jonzey231 So let's play this out: If someone takes the Netflix .apk and mods it with malware and then signs it, it will pass installation on the device. 1. User opens app. 2. App does whatever shitty thing it's designed to do while the user thinks they just got around the block. 3. The OS scans the app and warns the user it's been modified and they should uninstall it. 4. User thinks "Ha! I know and that's why it works!" 5. User keeps app until they get a call from Credit Karma that their identity was probably stolen but they don't know how. 6. Person spends 6 months fixing stolen identity. But still uses that app the whole time. Ultimately, that user is still going to be screwed. Would you or I make this mistake? No. Would your cousin's friend's dad because he had his son root so he could tether for free and overheard you guys talking about sideloading apps and googled how to do it? Yes. Randroid Problem is, even in your scenario, root has nothing to do with it. Someone who is not rooted could do the same thing. The only problem is, now MORE people who root are going to be *forced* to look for a modified apk because the official apk is not available from the Play Store. So in the end, it's causing more problems than it's fixing. Corbin Baxter Here's the thing about rooting: when you alter your devices software like that, then Google shouldn't be responsible for anything that comes afterwards for the user. This just helps discourage rooting, which can alter a new users perspective on Android, or make someone reconsider getting an Android device. someone755 For what it's worth, back in 2011/2010, many of us bought into Android *because* we could root. Imagine the possibilities of being in control of so much more of your system than with any mobile OS prior; We've spent hundreds (some, thousands) of dollars in this environment, on devices, apps, books etc. I understand this isn't how things stand nowadays, but root is still prevalent because of one issue that Google will not fix (or at least, won't until O+ is running on the majority of devices, but that'll take two years at the minimum), and those are updates and vendor apps (i.e. bloatware). If my phone is stuck on Lollipop I'm going to root it; I'll be able to mitigate the memory leak performance drops, and overall customize the device to fit my specific needs -- I've made quite a few friends (think ROM and kernel devs) because I just wanted to put a thermal engine better than Qualcomm's horrendous MPDecision into the kernel directly (i.e. I took the kernel source and modified it to fit my needs). What Google is trying to do here is, yes, discourage rooting, but instead of fixing the root cause (heh) behind why people root in the first place (that is, again, customizability and personal(ized) performance tuning, in large part to keep devices on older Android versions alive), root wouldn't be necessary. In the long run this *might* fix the symptom, but it most definitely will not help in fixing the cause. And that's because the cause is Google itself. As if apps like Snapchat blocking power users from their apps wasn't enough, now there's this -- If it becomes so common that even Google's own apps start to utilize the feature, I'll be gone to another mobile platform within a month. That might mean iOS, it might mean S60v3, I'll know that if (or rather, when) it happens. tl;dr: Google is putting a band-aid on a shotgun wound. Corbin Baxter I'm speaking mainly for new Android users. They don't feel as comfortable rooting. Doing this makes Android SEEM more like iOS. This doesn't MAKE Android like iOS. New users are comfortable with that. This is the same issue Microsoft had with Windows 8/8.1. Classic users, and Windows enthusiasts, hated someone changing the way they would use their computers. Microsoft introduced a different way of doing things, and to enthusiasts, it was bad, no matter how good it might be. Google's Project Treble should mostly fix the fragmentation problem, therefore giving Android users one less reason to root. To us enthusiasts, nothing can beat rooting, but it might not be the best solution to the problems Android has. Google seems intent on fixing the problems rooting tries to solve, but in a higher-quality and reliable way. No hard feelings😉 trparky They won't understand that, they're too blinded by their geek rose colored glasses. Corbin Baxter I don't expect everyone to understand, but I'll be happy if even a small handful understand what Google is doing here. Dmitri Smirnov > when you alter your devices software like that, then Google shouldn't be responsible for anything that comes afterwards for the user. As if right now Google or the OEMs are in any ways responsible for the malware or unpatched firmware vulnerabilities that stay this way for year. But yes, the users that root are the problem. Corbin Baxter For unrooted phones, yes Google and OEMs are very responsible. But after you root, Android loses most of its security and stability, and rooting is basically tinkering with core system files. Google doesn't have any control over what the user can or can't do after that. bekifft That wasn't even a devil's advocate, that was a straight up strawman. Frosted Butts Yes.. please tell me about all the Netflix alternatives i can install, that can legally stream from Netflix...... Right now, if i am rooted and want Netflix (a service i am paying for), i must go through 3rd party app stores to install the APK. There is no choice at all... R Firestone ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ Umm you have the choice to unroot your device. Maxr1998 ..which is a bad choice for many. d0x360 Yes you do except I rooted my device to make it MORE secure. Unrooting would make my device less secure than sideloading apps would. username_not_valid People can keep saying that, but the content providers have no way to know whether or not you have taken measures to secure your custom device, whereas if they go down this root they know its handled. BAlGaInTl "whereas if they go down this root they know its handled" I see what you did there. 😆😄 ...or just watch Netflix from Chrome! You could even do this from a Linux box with root! 😃 Suicide_Note Sure there is: unroot. Problem solved. neoKushan "I've solved this problem by creating 3 more problems - but it IS solved!" Eric Braun https://www.amazon.com/Netflix-Inc/dp/B005ZXWMUS Option C .. ?? h4rr4r A choice that is now more popular. dcdttu It's not so much about what a user chooses to do. It's about probability. The probability that sites are going to try to lure users into downloading malware-infected Netflix APKs from 3rd party sites is going to go up if you can't download it from a safe source in the first place. This is just like the fact that, if you don't give drug users a safe and clean place to shoot up, they're going to go do it somewhere else that's much more dangerous. Both of these scenarios are bad for society in general, no matter what the original intention was. kgptzac 1/10. Gotta try harder. Premsuraj How? Google Play Protect will still catch malicious apps makapav Yes but you're potentially making people venture through shady sites to get the APKs. Eric Braun Or to Amazons App store or Fdroid. The people going to shady sites are already going there, this isn't going to increase the traffic by any real amount. tehboogieman Are you sure that Google will continue allowing GPP for unlocked or rooted users going forward? Not to mention that it's not a silver bullet for 0days d0x360 It barely works as is. There are tons of apps that slip through every day. Krebs on security reports on them quite frequently. I don't trust Google's scanning of apps at all which is why I root. I can make my phone more secure and I can also image the device as often as I want so if something does happen it's fixed within 5 min. If I unroot then I lose the protection along with the backups. Premsuraj Custom ROMs and root can't protect from 0days either. And just out of curiosity how is root going to provide more security? If anything it makes the device less secure tehboogieman Nobody said root makes a device more secure. Blocking root users from downloading apps from the Play Store puts users at more risk since those users will be more inclined to sideload apps from sources that might not be as reliable as the Play Store. Premsuraj The only people who cares about this are the people who root. And those user's generally tend to be more knowledgeable about what kind of apps and app stores they can trust. ASYOUTHIA✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ And only <2% of users will do this to keep rooted. xxTheGoDxx Only the plus 50 - 100 Million users that have root: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=eu.chainfire.supersu ASYOUTHIA✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ You do realize that that's just downloads right? ...not active users. blindexecutioner I'm not mad. I continue to use things like magisk to help get around stuff like this. All this will do is encourage me to use unauthorized sources for offending apps if magisk ever stops working. There is a reason I use Android over iOS and it certainly isn't because the apps are better designed or whatever. brian. Magisk is a good way around this. However, I don't know how long this will last. I would think with security in mind and developers trying to monetize more, it will put pressure on Google to make SafetyNet get triggered much easier. Obviously, I don't have any way of knowing, but this could easily turn into a cat and mouse game more than it already is. Android Pay was first, other apps did it like Super Mario Run, which who cares, but now Netflix? Changes are coming, and it doesn't look good for the rooting community. D13H4RD2L1V3 I'm not sure if everyone gets why some of us went through the trouble of gaining SU access. Sure, maybe there's a few who went through all that trouble for nefarious purposes (and maybe that got regulatory bodies concerned to the point where Google even needed to consider this) but from my perspective at least, a lot of us gain Superuser access mainly to get features that we liked on other Android flavors, especially in the case of a build of Android that's very close to Google's vision. Such as the ability to hide the navbar at any time we wanted and also to gain theming support (which I feel should be added officially sooner rather than later because I absolutely hate how Google is making their already-bright UI even more eye-searing with even more white-colored elements, which also makes the benefits of OLED much less obvious). I wouldn't be as concerned if these features were pushed to AOSP soon, but as it stands, I feel that Google should probably think about making these features available soon. Marty Thank the bad apples for why you no longer have freedom. Jeremy ディリマ Would changing region firmware with Odin flag the SafetyNet check on Samsung mobiles? Soz if it's a stupid question a lot has changed since I last fiddled with Android Christopher Robert This was a long time coming. Once root user started using root to pirate software, and/or get around geo locks, instead of using it to add feature to their firmware or improve their devices performance, it was only a matter of time before it all got torn down. h4rr4r Get around geo locks? You mean have my device report the location I want it to report? Yeah, how terrible that I control what my computer does. dizel123 You still do. This doesn't affect that at all h4rr4r You said the justification for that was people using their devices for their own reasons in the way they liked. I was pointing out that this is a normal thing and not something that should be punished. Cuvis You don't need root to pirate. You never did. Marty Apple says, Thank you. h4rr4r Sounds like we need a new FREE platform. Maybe Amazon can use this to push their store. mxwp but will the Netflix from the Amazon App Store work on rooted phones? Curt RIP Root. I'm not moving from stock anymore, just cab with the hassle. Until there's a 'reliable' way to hide from Safety Net, I'll enjoy my Android Pay, banking apps and overall smoothness. (If it was up to me, I'd be rooted with Linage) h4rr4r IOS is the platform for you. That was the deal from the beginning. hp-fourtwenty magisk....giyf .y phone is rooted with lineage 14.1, and passes safetynet. problem solved! jcopernicus Fantastic news. Lawstorant All this butthurt for what? You all sound like Magisk doesn't exist. Dave Hamilton Lets take Apple and there closed source. Lets take Google and there open source, the freedom to do and change as you please to make the device yours. No two devices have to be the same. Lets get 115 million android users, and then start deciding you no longer have this choice and freedom to do what you want! When something gets better and better, its only a matter of time before all the things you love are removed and comersilised Eric Braun You still have the option to do what you want. However like everything there are reactions for every action. Want to root or unlock your device? Sure, however there may be a few apps that no longer appear in the playstore. May want to have a backup like Amazon App Store or something similar ready. No one is stopping you, feel free to do as you please. tehboogieman Man, if I have to choose between having a device with root or a device with apps that use day to day, the iPhone goes from a 1% chance of being my daily driver to about 50% There are still a lot that can Android can do that iOS can't, but if I'm living in a walled garden the iPhone is looking pretty attractive. 5+ years of official OS support, solid retail network for quick service or hardware exchanges. The Play Store is my main source of apps that I know are vetted and generally safe. I have no desire to manage app updates manually. There is always a chance that someone will build and maintain an appstore that will have all root blocked apps (maybe the future of APKMirror?). If not it might be the death of Android for users like me Eric Braun Even without all of this I would use an APKMirror App that allowed for updating of apps automatically. dizel123 Google gives app developers more control over their apps. Whiny entitled internet crybabies go on the internet and whine and cry. Aka...Thursday neoKushan Alternatively: Google restricts users from using their device, which they own, how they see fit. dizel123 Except Google isn't restricting anyone from doing anything. But being 100% wrong has never stopped anyone in the internet NubCake being an asshole (in your case) hasn't stopped anyone from commenting eather it seems. dizel123 I can admit to being an asshole. But I'm also right so it's all good. neoKushan It's certainly not stopping you. dizel123 I haven't experienced it so of course it's not stopping me trparky You may own the hardware but you don't own the software, you only have a license to use it. Csöpi Thats so greate. I have a stock oneplus one and for some strange reasons i was failing the test beforhand, but now its all green. Still cant update the netflix app hence chromecast isnt working either anymore. Not really happy. JC If there's a will there's a way. brian. If more developers get on board with this, I can't see why I would switch to Android. I've always been curious about new Android phones, bought a bunch and rooted them all if I could. This is not good for a person like me. d0x360 If Google keeps this up and app devs include the api to block rooted phones then my days using Android will be over and Google will have lost a user who's been there since the g1. I don't know what I'd switch to... probably windows mobile because I'm not a fan of apple whatsoever. It's really a shame because if I had to guess I'd say 99.99% of people who root do so for either the added security and or customized experiences. For example I use root to modify my status bar and quick panel as well as firewall my apps and use adaway and yes Google I do whitelist sites that aren't obnoxious with their ads. John Doe All the more reason for the APK mirror appstore LoL Jan-Lk Else Yeah Google want's us to buy tooooo expensive phones to just get the latest Android, because cheap phones suck at updates and so they need to be flashed and rooted... trparky But if the community raises holy hell with the OEMs then maybe it will be corrected. There's no damn reason why a three year old device can't be updated when an eight year old Windows 7 machine is still receiving Windows Updates. McStagger WHY DOES NETFLIX CARE IF THE PHONE IS ROOTED?!?!?!?! mxwp Netflix does not care, but the content creators that make the stuff you see on Netflix do care. They care because they are idiots who think it is easier to pirate from rooted phones. bekifft Again, Google becomes more and more restrictive. I switched from iPhone because the screens were too small, and Google was far less restrictive. Both of those issues are now resolved, and Google's upped the price of their device to match Apple. May as well switch back to iPhone, Google seems to support it just as much as Android anyway. Luxferro Except it's not just rooted users! Any device with an unlocked bootloader. hp-fourtwenty Your comment sucks for misinforming users about what safetynet is....has NOTHING to do with unlocked bootloaders. Luxferro Sure it does. My Nexus 6P only has an unlocked bootloader, and Netflix disappeared from the play store after the last update. And I'm not the only one, so I suggest you do some reading. TechGuy22 more reason for me to pirate hey, have at it Matías Duarte I hope Netflix does the same with Jailbroken iOS devices. Why they do this btw? To prevent people recording their movies? You can do that with Windows.. Knowledgeborn Allah In all honesty, that'll probably never happen. Jailbreaking iOS opens the doors to a lot of customization on an iPhone, but the security issues are often minimal (with the exception being not having the latest software version). Jailbreaking is pretty much filtered through the Cydia platform. You don't have access to the entire system with a jailbreak. Rooting is completely different, because you can completely reshape the core OS. fbl Note : I don't work for Netflix so I can't comment for them. Possible causes : - the right holders might be pushing for this. I work on roughly the same product area and we don't implement DRM because we like them, we implement them because we contractually have to. -Netflix is tired of getting low notes because of crashes coming by shitty hacks in custom roms. Zach Mauch Anyone know how chromebooks will be affected by this? Will dev mode being enabled cause you to fail SafetyNet Checks? That is currently the only way to install apks on Chromebooks. Branko But Android AOSP!11 -Google 2011 How the times how changed. Wayne Randall ALT arguement, because I don't have time to read every comment... This doesn't limit me and my rooted N6P at all, this move limits how much money they (the devs and Google) are going to make. I can't buy it (the app or coins, or special characters, or bonus content, w/e) if I can't see it. Plain and simple. The important apps will still be there. No app is worth unroot. Block Project Fi from root though... weeeellll. I guess I'd unroot for that. mxwp yeah, only Netflix, banks, and big names will use these blocks. i am guessing most devs want as much exposure as possible. PVL_93_RU Google is actively trying to kill the modding community. Not the Custom ROM makers, but people who root and install Xposed. All because they compromise the security for Android Pay I fear the day root and Xposed apps start disappearing from the Play Store trparky If it comes to security vs being open, security will always win (or at least should always win). Eric Koop I had my Shaw Gateway app update yesterday and they changed it so it doesn't work if rooted. So I had to uninstall and find an APK online of an older version. Now it's just a matter of time before I forget and re-install the update. What a pain... disqus_em5YfkbWdk Well this would certainly get me to cancel Netflix. My personal Plex server is far better than Netflix could ever be anyway. Vivek Rameses Becoming apple more and more every day. Disgusting. Knowledgeborn Allah Android is starting to look more and more like iOS with each update... ¯_(ツ)_/¯ trparky Open platforms rarely stay open once the Benjamins start rolling in. hp-fourtwenty Go ahead and block me...I'll just pirate your app. Play nice and so will I. Start poking me and I'll poke back by never giving you another penny. App devs can't beat XDA devs. It's not going to happen. My unlocked, rooted, rommed and modded device still passes safety net. The day that stops, so does the flow of money leaving my hands on the play store. Luxferro Lay off the sodas.... UniBroW Question, can those of you without access to Netflix on Google play, can it be installed from the Amazon App Store? Stanley C. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/dd381b7e8a39df74c4725712a0db906098c965e9ee4194b6e01e020fd69ee566.png Thats how magisk is made... Magic! Marti Abernathey Yawn. I've got a rooted device and just installed Netflix... because? Magisk. As soon as they made this choice I cancelled. Not because I can't get around it, but because they make me do that. mrjayviper even on a non-rooted LOS mis 5s+, I cannot install Netflix. unlocking the bootloader already tripped safety. And I don't want to root. The features available in non-rooted LOS is enough for me. Teh BuG No. Bueno. TedPhillips Sigh. What's the over-under on this becoming pervasive in the play store... MicroG / Fdroid I'm coming soon. World needs a solid single alternative gcm replacement to catch on. TedPhillips As far as the potential for support overhead, being rooted is generally less than the pain coming from the Xposed/magisk crowd. You need to be actively interfering with an app via root vs code being injected into low levels of the framework that everything uses. TedPhillips I think the best outcome could be that Google opens up their process for little guys to certify there own rom builds, ala let's encrypt lowering friction on getting ssl setup. AOSP should not be a functionally useless base implementation for I'm roms, but something you can use in​ practice. TedPhillips Hey guys, don't worry. Google says Android is for everyone. https://www.android.com/everyone/ That includes AOSP developers too, right? That website seems to tread the line pretty carefully, ala 'no one is forcing you use Google play' but Hiroshi's quote seems like it comes with a grain of salt since he owns Play. I'd love to see AP interview him about this. qkjDlav As an app developer for a large app used globally, the two biggest time wasters in a developer's life are a) debugging device specific issues (HTC, Samsung, etc) and b) crash logs with Xposed in the stack trace. Developers are tired of having to sit around with device farms at their desks just to make sure new features and changes work with each quirky variant of Android that manufacturers want to deploy, and custom roms do make it worse. Enthusiasts are welcome to customize their own versions of Android and sideload apps, but we don't want to see crashlogs in the Developer Console from rooted/custom ROM users. And companies probably don't want to keep paying us to debug issues that only a small minority of users will see. Lê Nguyên Chương Most stupid thing I've ever heard in my life.

Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge: 6 Weeks With Android Nougat Purity Article Index:    Living On Google's Pixel XL, Coming From A Different Galaxy Pixel XL vs GS7 Edge Industrial Design – Beauty Is In The Eye Operating System, Software And Camera – Google Victory And A Draw Google Pixel XL And Daydream View Performance And Final Analysis – Google Pixel XL Vs. Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge Living On Google's Pixel XL, Coming From A Different Galaxy When Google set out to develop and market its first Phone by Google branded device - not co-branded with a partner - and spiritual successors to its legacy Nexus brand, the company drew a line in the sand. Not only was the target to develop smartphones that demonstrated best of breed functionality and performance for the Android platform, but these devices would have features and capabilities not found in other Android devices on the market. To date, very few other smartphones, save for the LG V20 for example, are running Android 7 Nougat and there are only a handful of phones on the market currently that support Google’s Daydream VR headset technology. Google Daydream VR is a compelling answer to smartphone VR solutions like Samsung Gear VR, but what’s really interesting to many consumers is how Google’s latest flagship handset compares experientially versus other hot-selling Android devices, like Samsung’s Galaxy S7 series. As a perennial Samsung Galaxy S series user, I decided it was high time, beyond just the sterile confines of a product review, to live with Google’s latest Android purist device for an extended period of time. I’ve spent quality time with Nexus devices in the past, but the Google Pixel XL, with its 5.5-inch AMOLED display, felt like a possible successor as a daily driver for me. So, here are my high level take-aways of a Galaxy S7 Edge to Pixel XL migration, from hardware to software, and creature comforts. Our hands-on video walk-around of the Google Pixel XL with Daydream View Pixel XL vs Galaxy S7 Edge – The Display Goes To Samsung I’m going to get this one out of the way early. If your primary focus is on the display in a handset, there is just no comparison to Samsung’s Super AMOLED displays currently, especially the curved glass of the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge. Google’s Pixel XL AMOLED display does a reasonably good job of reproducing the saturation, contrast and pop of the Galaxy S7 Edge, but it’s not quite as bright, nor does it have quite the viewing angle capability.  There’s also no substitution for the effect of the curved, edge-to-edge display on the Galaxy S7 Edge. The Pixel XL (seen here above) is flanked with more bezel and the display itself is not quite as close to the glass as the GS7 Edge. So oddly enough, if you’re a pixel snob, the Galaxy S7 Edge actually wins over Google's namesake Pixel XL. That's not to say the Pixel XL is hampered in any way from an image quality standpoint; it's just once you've seen what Samsung's curved 5.5-inch display can do, there's nothing quite like it currently. Although, admittedly, close seconds are indeed the Google Pixel XL as well as the Moto Z.  Power Efficiency And Battery - A Landslide Win For The Pixel XL Here’s where the always-on benchmark numbers, versus real world anecdotal use case, vary greatly.  The Galaxy S7 Edge has a larger 3600 mAh battery versus the Pixel XL’s 3450 mAh power plant, but that doesn’t always equate to longer mixed-usage uptime; at least with the current setup of Android 6 Marshmallow on an AT&T GS7 Edge, versus the Pixel XL with Nougat and the same carrier. Android 7 Nougat’s advanced Doze capabilities make an appreciable difference in mainstream usage battery life. If you’re not the type to be on your phone constantly, the Pixel XL offers a significant battery life advantage versus the Galaxy S7 Edge. This could change as Samsung rolls out Android 7 to its Galaxy line, but it’s up to carriers to push via OTA updates as well – which of course AT&T is late to the party with, as usual it seems. That said, I've noticed the Pixel XL survives for nearly two days of mixed use (calls, web browsing, emails, text), in my specific use case. I would consider myself a moderate, but not heavy user. For reference, I generally consume about 3 - 4 Gigs of data per month, though I am on WiFi quite a bit. Also, though I don't use Google Maps a lot, I did leave the High Accuracy location services function on as the Pixel XL noticed my every move from office to restaurants and back home. In short, versus the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge in the same exact use case with my personal usage patterns, the Pixel XL generally survives, again mostly due to Android Nougat Doze features when idle, hours longer on average than what I was realizing on the Galaxy S7 Edge. I wish Google delivered wireless charging with the Pixel XL, but regardless, its battery life prowess offers a significant, tangible gain.

The Phab 2 Pro is the first consumer retail device to support Google Project Tango AR technology, with a multi-camera and sensor array that gives the smartphone the ability to sense and "see" the environment around it, and then map and render virtual augmentations in the environment for the user. The Lenovo Phab 2 Pro is also one of the largest Android smartphones on the market currently, with a ginormous 6.4-inch IPS display and a footprint exceeding 7-inches at its tallest point. Without question, the Phab 2 Pro is every bit a Phablet, if ever there was such a commonly referred to beast.  Equally as notable perhaps, the Phab 2 Pro also represents Lenovo's first commercially available US smartphone, from Lenovo proper, rather than a Moto device from the company's wholly owned subsidiary Motorola Mobility. Moto definitely has its mojo working as of late with excellent, innovative product launches of the Moto Z family with Moto Mods, but can Lenovo flex its muscle in handsets - "for those who do?" If innovation is a key yardstick for you, the Phab 2 Pro's AR skills are certainly a good start. Let's take a closer look...  First, spend a few minutes checking out our hands-on preview, then we'll dive into the particulars, experience, and performance analysis...  Lenovo Phab 2 Pro Specifications & Features Processor 64-bit Qualcomm Snapdragon Octal-Core 652 1.8GHz Processor GPU Adreno 510 System Memory 4GB Internal storage 64GB Storage Expansion MicroSD - Supports up to 128GB Weight 259 grams (9.14 ounces) Dimensions 179.83mm x 88.57mm x 6.96~10.7mm (7.08 x 3.49 x 0.42 inches) Display 6.4-inch Quad HD (2560X1440) IPS Assertive Display Battery 4050mAh (non-removable), Quick Charge 3.0 Support Rear Cameras 16MP Fast-Focus, Tango Depth Sensor (IR Camera), Tango Motion Tracking (Fisheye Camera) Video 1080p HD video recording at 30 fps, 720p HD video recording at 30 fps, 3-axis electronic image stabilization Front Camera 8 megapixels photos, f/2.2 aperture, 1.4 um Big Pixel Audio Triple Array Microphone with Active Noise-Cancellation, Dolby Atmos + Dolby Audio Capture 5.1 FM Receiver FM Radio Wi-Fi 802.11a/b/g/n/ac, Bluetooth 4.0 SIM/Ports 2G/3G/4G Nano SIM Card, Nano SIM + TF Card, Micro USB Networks GSM: B2/3/5, UMTS: B1/2/3/4/5, FDD LTE: 2/4/5/7/12/17/20/30 Sensors G-Sensor, P-Sensor, L-Sensor, Accelerator, E-Compass, Gyroscope, Hall Sensor, Ambient Light Sensor, Fingerprint Find The Lenovo Phab 2 Pro At Amazon For $499 Unlocked The specs of the Phab 2 Pro read fairly standard-issue for a current generation flagship Android smartphone. The caveat here is that Lenovo went with a more mid-range Qualcomm processor in the form of the Snapdragon 652. This should play out favorably with respect to battery life, but hold performance back a bit in gaming with its Adreno 510 graphics engine. However, the Snapdragon 652 has also been optimized by Qualcomm for Tango AR application requirements, which in and of themselves tend to be power hungry due to all the sensors and tracking involved.  We'll have to see for ourselves in the benchmarks, but the rest reads like a standard higher-end setup, with 4GB of RAM, 64GB of storage and, thankfully, microSD slot expansion, as well as 802.11ac WiFi.   You also get a reasonable well-appointed setup with the Phab 2 Pro with an included AC adapter and micro USB sync and charge cable, along with a set of JBL earbuds that don't sound half-bad. No USB-C available here, but the price is right at $499 unlocked and ready to roll.  Let's get a closer look at industrial design, materials and build quality...

Google Lens is a technology that integrates Google’s search engine with a smartphone’s camera. By taking a photo with Google Lens your camera will be able to recognize objects and search for them on the web. It goes deeper than that though, as CEO Sundar Pichai’s keynote went on some further examples were shown. Another demo Pichai showed off involved connecting to a WiFi network after taking a picture of the name and password. A further search-related example involving taking a picture of a restaurant menu in a foreign language. Google Lens returned both a translated version of the menu and pictures of the dishes. Google Lens can also tap into information from Google My Business and Google Maps. After taking a picture of a restaurant you can see its reviews, hours of operation, contact information, and so on. There was also a demo of how Google Lens would work together with Google Assistant. After taking a picture of the marquee outside a venue, Google Assistant offered help with buying tickets and adding the event to Google Calendar. No timeframe was given as to when Google Lens is expected to launch, but when it does it will not be a standalone app. Pichai said Google Lens would be available through Google Assistant and Google Photos.

The company has managed to cut down the time it takes to render content in half from just a year ago. Google attributes the speed gains to changes such as server-side rendering, and reducing the bandwidth usage from images by 50% without reducing quality. Google is also utilizing a compression algorithm called Brotli to reduce the size of documents by a further 10% in certain browsers. Google took the opportunity during its announcement to highlight some AMP milestones. There are now over 2 billion AMP sites on the web across 900,000 domains. A whopping 340 million of those pages comes from Tumblr, which shared the news that it has that many AMP’d blog posts published across 500,000 domains. Twitter also shared news that it would be expanding support for AMP pages to its Android and iOS app. Currently, AMP URLs can only be shared on Twitter via its mobile web client. There may be an influx of AMP pages in the near future as the AMP network expands to more e-commerce sites. Google is also developing new AMP ads which may attract new publishers, because previously the monetization options for AMP pages was very limited. Whether it’s the expanded support for e-commerce or not, but eBay shared news it would be extending its support for AMP throughout millions more of its pages. The e-commerce giant has already touted published over 15 million AMP pages, now it will be AMP’ing up all its product pages as well as name brand and interest pages. AMP has momentum, and with the continued support of major publishers it’s showing no signs of slowing down. More AMP news may be on the way next week as the company unveils its AMP Project roadmap for the next quarter. We’ll make sure to report on anything of note.

Every few months, a dumb startup will make the news – most recently the one selling a US$700 ($943) juicer – and folks outside the tech industry will begin singing I-told-you-so's. But don't be fooled by expensive juice. The idea that Silicon Valley no longer funds big things isn't just wrong, but also obtuse and fairly dangerous. Look at the cars, the rockets, the internet-beaming balloons and gliders, the voice assistants, drones, augmented and virtual reality devices, and every permutation of artificial intelligence you've ever encountered in sci-fi. Technology companies aren't just funding big things – they are funding the biggest, most world-changing things. They are spending on ideas that, years from now, we may come to see as having altered life for much of the planet. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link The tech industry's huge investments in AI might be cause for alarm, because they are not balanced by anywhere near that level of investment by the government. Photo: NYT At the same time, the US government's appetite for funding big things – for scientific research and out-of-this-world technology and infrastructure programs – keeps falling, and it may decline further under President Donald Trump. This sets up a looming complication: Technology giants, not the government, are building the artificially intelligent future. And unless the government vastly increases how much it spends on research into such technologies, it is the corporations that will decide how to deploy them. Related Content Google's AI wants to get even deeper into our lives Google, Facebook manage internet when it suits Consider Google. On Wednesday, the internet search company kicked off its annual developer conference near its headquarters in Mountain View, California. The company showed off several advances to its voice-enabled assistant and its mobile operating system. Among other things, you can now point your phone at an object in the real world – a flower, a sign in another language, a marquee for a rock concert – and the phone will give you more information about what you're looking at (for instance, a button to buy tickets for the concert). Some of this was cool, but little was truly groundbreaking, which isn't surprising: We're in an awkward phase of the tech industry, one marked by incremental improvements to technologies that we think of as boring – and lots of exciting promises about far-off tech that isn't quite ready for prime time. The real advances at Google are in that second category. At last year's show, Sundar Pichai, Google's chief executive, inaugurated what he called a new era for Google. The search company would henceforth be an "AI-first" company – that is, most of its advances would be driven by artificial intelligence techniques. Advertisement The technology would play a role in consumer products, like Google's instant translator or its photo app, which can recognise uniquely human search terms (it can find pictures of "hugs," for instance). But AI also informs Google's more ambitious plans. The company is using artificial intelligence to teach computers to understand language, to see and hear, to diagnose diseases, and even to create art. A lot of these plans will fail, but Google isn't making big, long-term bets out of altruism. The company understands that the AI-based projects that succeed could be transformational: They will alter existing industries and create huge new ones, including a stream of new businesses from which Google can profit. Google is not alone in this quest to build a future out of AI. Its parent company, Alphabet, is spending billions to inject machine intelligence into much of the global economy, from self-driving cars to health care. Then there are the other members of the Frightful Five – Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Microsoft – which are also spending heavily on the intelligent future. Collectively, the five are among the biggest investors in research and development on the planet. According to their earnings reports, they are on track to spend more than US$60 billion this year on research and development. By comparison, in 2015, the US federal government spent about $67 billion on all nondefense-related scientific research. There are two ways to respond to the tech industry's huge investments in the intelligent future. On the one hand, you could greet the news with optimism and even gratitude. The technologies that Google and other tech giants are working on will have a huge impact on society. Self-driving cars could save tens of thousands of lives a year, for instance, while computerised methods for diagnosing and treating disease could improve our health and cut the cost of care. What's more, experts in the field say that many tech giants are currently approaching AI with a kind of academic ethos. For instance, they regularly publish papers on their findings, and – through their cloud server businesses – they are allowing third-party companies to access some of their latest AI tech. But the tech industry's huge investments in AI might also be cause for alarm, because they are not balanced by anywhere near that level of investment by the government. In the waning days of the Obama administration, the White House published a report examining the ways artificial intelligence would alter the world. The report found that the federal government spent only US$1.1 billion on unclassified AI research in 2015. It argued for increasing spending on artificial intelligence by several times. With greater federal funding, the report said, researchers could focus more on basic research – more tenuous, potentially less immediately applicable areas of AI – and through the grant-making process, the government would have a greater say in how the technology develops. What's interesting is that many in the tech industry agree with the need for greater federal funding. OpenAI was created by Elon Musk, Peter Thiel and other tech luminaries, and it has received funding from Microsoft, Amazon and Y Combinator, the startup incubator. Google also favours federal funding for tech research. In May, Eric Schmidt, Alphabet's executive chairman, was one of the authors of an op-ed in The Washington Post arguing that federal funding of science and technology had created a "miracle machine": a public-private partnership that has churned out dozens of new industries over decades. "If we don't change course and invest in scientific research, we risk losing one of America's greatest advantages," he wrote. In other words, the tech giants that are building the future would like some help changing the world. We would be wise to chip in – or let them take over the future for themselves.

Google, Alexa, Cortana, oh my! It’s been a week full of competing smart-assistant news from Google, Amazon and even Microsoft. Google released its smart assistant as an iOS app, and although the assistant can do some things Siri can’t, co-host Todd Bishop had a hard time getting it to work well for him.  Google also announced new upgrades to its Google Home device, including unlimited free voice calls to any phone in North America, something co-host Andru Edwards is pretty jazzed about. On the other side of the coin, Amazon announced the new Alexa-enabled touchscreen Echo Show, and Alexa Voice Calling, and Microsoft announced big changes to how Windows and Cortana work on Android and iOS devices. We break down all the smart assistant news, including who’s coming out ahead, on this episode of Geared Up. Plus, we take a look at the most recent leaks of the new iPhone 8, including pictures that seem to be a prototype. There’s nothing too earth-shattering in the new news, but it does give us some extra glimpses into Apple’s direction. And we try out the fidget cube and the fidget spinner, two devices designed to calm you down by taking out all your nervous energy. They’re all the rage among kids and adults alike, but Todd and Andru aren’t particularly impressed.

Livemint Photo by iStockphoto/Imaging by Rohit Goyal. The rise of a technology has Bill Gates issuing warnings of an apocalypse. Elon Musk, too. Even Stephen Hawking. What’s worrying these technologists? It’s Artificial Intelligence or AI, an idea whose time has come—it is incubating in science labs and being deployed by start-ups and industrial units alike. Why are Gates and Co. worried? Specifically, it’s over machine learning, an early form of AI that has in recent years become mainstream, causing both delight and nervousness among AI experts and technology companies. AI involves building computers capable of taking smart decisions by themselves, the way humans do. Machine learning and various other sub-fields such as deep learning are the means to achieve AI. Google announced this week that it is rethinking all its products to base them on AI; it has created a new unit called Google.ai to facilitate this shift. The revival of interest in machine learning has been driven by a confluence of factors, such as the massive increase in computing power, emergence of neural networks (connected transistors that replicate the structure of neurons in the human brain) and the easy availability of vast amounts of data, thanks to the Internet. Compared to AI leaders in the Silicon Valley and China, India is a laggard but even here, nearly 300 start-ups are using some form of AI, according to Tracxn, a start-up tracker. Among dedicated AI-only Indian start-ups, 23% are working on providing solutions to multiple industries, 15% are in e-commerce, 12% in healthcare, 11% in education, 10% in financial services, and the rest in fields such as retail and logistics, according to a 2017 report by Kalaari Capital, a venture capital firm. Internet companies tap machine learning techniques for a range of uses—to recommend products for you, for instance, or to predict where cabs should be placed so that when you open your cab-hailing app, there’s one a couple of minutes’ drive away. Healthcare start-ups use AI to help hospitals make speedy and accurate blood reports and medical diagnoses, saving lives. Others get fashion brands and retailers to buy the right quantities of stock. Suddenly, AI is everywhere. Lounge looks at 10 exciting start-ups that are using AI and machine learning techniques to transform healthcare, education, auto and retail. Their success is far from assured. They struggle to find quality talent; they face stiff competition from other AI start-ups; their solutions haven’t yet stood the test of time (most are less than five years old); and they are vulnerable to a variety of other factors that typically bring down start-ups, AI or not. Given the number of AI start-ups, the list is far from comprehensive. Yet the work that these 10 start-ups (and others like them) do is exciting and sometimes cutting-edge, holding out the promise of a significantly improved product or service. How does this work? Traditional code writing entailed programming computers, essentially telling computers what to do. With machine learning, computers are taught to do things themselves. Pedro Domingos, a professor in computer science and engineering at the University of Washington, puts it fittingly in his book, The Master Algorithm: How The Quest For The Ultimate Learning Machine Will Remake Our World: “The Industrial Revolution automated manual work and the Information Revolution did the same for mental work, but machine learning automates automation itself.” This is what has people worried—and thrilled. The likes of Gates and Musk fear that machines that learn to think for themselves may become smarter than humans and start taking control of things—the stuff of science fiction. But others such as Domingos believe it will lead to a near-utopian state where people, freed of chores and menial work (now automated), will pursue things that truly excite them. No matter which side of the fence you are on, there’s little doubt that AI represents potentially the most disruptive leap in technology in decades. Apart from disrupting incumbents across businesses, AI may worsen a major socio-economic headache for India: employment. The threat from automation to engineering jobs in Indian IT companies is well documented. But IT is by no means the only business where jobs are at risk. Automation may be a threat to 69% of the jobs in India, according to an October 2016 World Bank report. Even Domingos, who expresses a never-failing belief in the potential of AI to do good for humankind, acknowledges that the technology is likely to make many jobs redundant. Case in point: One of the 10 start-ups we feature replaced its 40-strong content team with a few computer scientists when it adopted machine learning techniques. That represents only a mild threat from AI, especially in a country that is already failing to meet the growing demand for jobs. Investors and experts in AI privately worry about this threat—but they aren’t worried enough yet to look for solutions. That must say something about where their priorities lie—and about the disruption that Artificial Intelligence will cause. —By Mihir Dalal *** Netradyne co-founder Avneesh Agrawal. Photo: Hemant Mishra/Mint. Netradyne, Bengaluru and San Diego, US Investment: Raised $16 million (around Rs102.8 crore) from Reliance Industries Ltd in June 2016. The team: Founded by Avneesh Agrawal, a former Qualcomm Inc. president for India and South Asia, and David Julian, a former principal engineer at the US-based chip-maker. Intelligence factor: Netradyne’s Driveri, a powerful camera that analyses driving patterns and can help determine the cause of an accident. The soap-bar-sized device is attached to a vehicle’s rear-view mirror and rests on the inside of the windscreen, pointing towards the road. In July 2015, Agrawal, along with his long-time friend and colleague Julian, set up Netradyne, wanting to tackle that intractable problem of the modern world—road accidents. Netradyne’s main product is Driveri, which packs in four high-definition cameras generating 360-degree footage of the vehicle’s path (transmitted on a real-time LTE network), has a global positioning system, gyroscope sensors and accelerometer, and a Nvidia processor, the same one that is used in the iPhone 5. The unit captures visuals of the car’s surroundings, analyses driving patterns and stores the data on a cloud platform. It uses machine learning and deep-learning systems to analyse the entire scene in front of the car: traffic lights, stop signs, objects in its course, distance to every other vehicle, relative speeds and direction. The data generated enables the platform to determine whether the driver is overspeeding or driving rashly, adhering to traffic rules, is potentially drowsy or drunk, or taking multiple halts along the route. In the event of an accident, it also sends real-time alerts to the fleet operator. According to Agrawal, similar technology is used to power autonomous car projects across the world, such as those being developed by Google (Alphabet Inc.), Uber Inc., Robert Bosch GmbH and large car-makers like Toyota, Volkswagen Group and Daimler AG. After testing the product for over 750,000 miles (around 1.2 million kilometres), Netradyne launched Driveri in the US market in March and plans to launch it in India by June-July. It recently signed its first US client, Load One, a mid-sized cargo company that operates a fleet of 350 trucks. The solution is also useful for retail customers like parents of first-time teenage drivers. Agrawal says Netradyne’s main focus currently is to ensure driver safety. The product is being marketed to commercial fleet operators to enable them to monitor drivers and enhance the safety of cargo. “Using the solution, fleet managers can train drivers on safe driving practices, besides maintaining a close check on valuable cargo.... They can also create a scorecard for drivers and incentivize them on safe driving,” says Agrawal. Agrawal, whose company employs around 60 people, expects Driveri customers to see a significant reduction in the number of traffic violations and accidents; in turn, safer driving would result in greater fuel efficiency and lower maintenance costs. The other big market is insurance. “What we are essentially doing is quantifying risk,” Agrawal says. His plan is to bring Driveri to every car in the world with insurance partners who agree to use its data for investigating accidents and deciding on a more accurate premium amount. —By Yuvraj Malik Embibe founder Aditi Avasthi Embibe, Bengaluru Investment: $9 million from venture capital investors such as Kalaari Capital and Lightbox. The team: Founded by Aditi Avasthi, a former Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) and Barclays executive. Intelligence factor: In a country where the overall quality of education consistently lags behind those in developed nations, Embibe’s core AI product can be a game changer. In the book (and movie) Moneyball, a baseball coach and an economics graduate from Harvard use an analytics engine to ditch decades of baseball practice and identify a world-class team that ends up breaking numerous Major League Baseball records. Major teams end up adopting the model. Embibe is hoping to create a similar impact in the world of education. Its learning platform is being used by thousands of students and the start-up is in talks to ally with educational training centres. Embibe, which runs a website and a mobile app, collects data from students, charging only for advanced analysis and personalized learning recommendations. Students can actually improve test scores by fixing basic mistakes using its AI platform. For instance, Embibe’s First Look Accuracy metric trains students to maximize scores in a given test by first answering the questions they can attempt confidently and then moving on to the tougher ones. Another metric, “‘Time Spent On Questions Not Answered’, indicates no confidence, an inability to know what you know yourself. You’re unsure of your ability. This value is actually 41 minutes for Indian kids for the IIT exams out of 180 minutes—in an exam where 1 mark is almost equivalent to 10,000 ranks. So, think about it—if you’re able to bring this value down by 50%, the scores automatically trend up,” explains Avasthi. The company says it has identified 27 parameters that can, for instance, predict scores in an IIT entrance exam with 93% accuracy. To get the bulk of data that its core cloud-based platform crunches, the start-up bought 100Marks, another ed-tech start-up, in 2015. Embibe uses advanced-level analytics besides its core AI engine, including self-learning algorithms, machine learning and cognitive computing akin to IBM’s Watson. It started out as an analytics company in 2012 and began using AI and machine learning tools in 2014 in an effort to create personalized solutions for individual students. Embibe started with a 40-member team that was primarily responsible for content creation; now it’s down to just three. The cost of creating content is down “from the high hundreds to Rs20 per unit of content through automation,” says Avasthi, who has hired three machine learning and AI experts from top companies, including IBM. —By Anirban Sen Tricog Health Services co-founder Charit Bhograj. Tricog Health Services PVT. LTD, Bengaluru Investment: $2 million from Inventus Capital Partners, Blume Ventures and angel investors. The team: Charit Bhograj, a cardiologist; Zainul Charbiwala, who worked at IBM India and Qualcomm; Udayan Dasgupta, who worked at Texas Instruments; and Abhinav Gujjar, who worked at Thomson Reuters and Microsoft. Intelligence factor: What can take up to 6 hours before treatment starts, Tricog accomplishes in a few minutes. Nearly 7.5 million people die every year of heart disease. Around 1.5-3 million of them are in India; half of them can be saved by early diagnosis, according to Bhograj. “Yet almost 70% of the general physicians do not have an ECG (electrocardiography) machine,” he adds. ECG—a heart health test—is conducted through a machine which records the heart’s electrical movement. These machines are not widely available in India, nor are there enough cardiologists to interpret ECG data. And it can take up to 6 hours before a patient is diagnosed and sent for treatment, says Bhograj. So Tricog set out to help doctors make instant diagnoses of heart attacks and ensure treatment is not delayed. While Tricog sources ECG machines from General Electric Healthcare, it has built its own sensory device and fits it on the machines. It gives these devices to general physicians, clinics and nursing homes on a subscription basis. Through the Internet, this device sends the ECG or recorded heart movement to a set of algorithms, which then generates a report. Before the report is sent, a specialist doctor verifies it. In 2016, Tricog processed the ECG reports of 200,000 patients; about 11,000 of them were diagnosed with a heart attack. The company claims it has never reported false results. Yet, given the stakes, Bhograj reasons that “no matter how accurate the algorithm gets, there will always be a specialist (cardiologist) to verify the report churned out by it.” Founded in 2011, the company spent close to four years putting the technology together and launched the product in February 2015. As of April, Tricog had 600 clients (general physicians, clinics and nursing homes) across 178 cities and towns, and 20 specialist doctors, including clinical cardiologists, who study the reports. In the next five years, Tricog aims to be present in 100,000 locations—it claims that though such a scale would ordinarily require around 700 doctors, it would be able to deliver comparable service with only 50 doctors. —By Arushi Chopra Arya.ai, Mumbai Arya.ai’s co-founder Vinay Kumar Sankarapu. Photo: Aniruddha Chowdhury/Mint. Investment: An undisclosed amount from YourNest Angel Fund and VentureNursery. the team: Vinay Kumar Sankarapu, chief executive officer, and Deekshith Marla, chief technology officer. Intelligence factor: Many start-ups are working with AI to solve problems in banking and insurance. Arya.ai tells them how to. Last year, world champion Lee Sedol was pitted against AlphaGo, a computer program made by Google, in a game of Go, an abstract board game. All AlphaGo needed to be told was the desired result. It figured out the rest for itself. Sankarapu, seated in his office in Mumbai’s Andheri area, says the day isn’t far when a business firm will be able to apply AI for similar results. His company, Arya.ai, is taking steps towards this; it is helping build AI that “becomes more intelligent the more it is used. The next generation of AI will be built by AI,” he says. Many start-ups in India are working with deep learning, which aims to make human effort minimal. Arya.ai works as an “enabler”. For instance, if a consultancy firm is building AI for its investment banking client, Arya.ai will provide the firm with the tools to build it, creating the “neural network”—a vast computing system that mimics the human brain; it will create a cloud system which will allow the AI to evolve, learn from its earlier tasks and apply them to the next one. “Basically, we help build a complicated system really fast, help you automate a lot of stuff. An algorithm may take months to build. We could actually help you build a complete system in weeks,” he says. Arya.ai also has direct clients, such as banks or insurance companies, where cases of fraud claims and bad loans can be identified with precision. The change is already visible: the phone call you get from your bank when an irregularity in your transaction pattern is registered is courtesy its AI-enabled system. This is the result of the data fed into it, based on geographical location and your records of the past 30 days. But as hackers get sharper—making low-key transactions over a long period of time after carefully observing the customer’s banking habits—deep learning will take it to the next level, with greater accuracy. Currently, Arya.ai is engaged with one of the world’s biggest consultancy firms, New York and London-based banks, global insurance companies and leading manufacturing firms. Their work is mostly at the business-to-business level but the effects, says Sankarapu, will also be felt by the man on the street. “Things will become super-fast, personalized and cost-efficient for the end consumer,” says Sankarapu, who grew up in Andhra Pradesh’s Kadapa district and now shuttles between Mumbai and San Francisco. In 2015, Arya.ai was chosen as one of the 21 most innovative start-ups by Paris&Co, a French innovation agency. Arya.ai started out as a way of making the lives of researchers easier in 2013, at a time when Sankarapu was studying at the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay. If there were 200,000 books on a particular subject, it was not humanly possible to read them all; Sankarapu was trying to build AI that would absorb as much information as these books would hold in less time than the human brain ever could. “I soon understood that the bigger problem is not building a solution but enabling it. Everyone wants to use deep learning, but they don’t know how to use it,” he says. Sankarapu is a Marvel fan but he’s never had any romantic notions about AI. He says that like any new, exciting technology that comes every decade or so, AI has been hyped beyond its capabilities. To him, it is a formula, one which is more exciting than fantasy. “When you start understanding how to build it, you start understanding what we are made of. The human brain is nothing but a simple mathematical computer.” —Sankhayan Ghosh Locus.sh’s founders Geet Garg (left) and Nishith Rastogi. Photo: Hemant Mishra/Mint Locus.sh (Mara Labs INC.), Bengaluru and US Investment: At least $2.75 million from Exfinity Venture Partners, Blume Ventures, BeeNext and others. The team: Nishith Rastogi, who has worked with Amazon and eBay; and Geet Garg, who was with Amazon. The two had co-founded PinChat, a location-based conversational platform, in August 2014. Intelligence factor: Locus has developed route-planning algorithms so companies can chart the best possible route to deliver an order and allow a salesperson to cover the maximum number of points in the shortest time possible. Locus aims to automate all the human decisions involved in sending a package. With clients such as Hindustan Unilever, Quikr, Urban Ladder and Lenskart, it has a lot on its hands. The company, which says it has more than 25 clients, has developed a route-planning engine, its core business, apart from a 3D packing engine that provides configurations for loading cargo into containers. Locus also offers companies a weekly schedule of the most efficient routes and outlets for their sales teams. Rastogi says each schedule planned by their routing engine takes 5-10 minutes, whereas a skilled human being would take 1-4 hours to process the same data. The company says it helps its clients reduce their logistics costs by at least 25%. Locus offers solutions for both intracity and intercity operations. It estimates the domestic freight industry is around $100 billion; a bulk of this is intercity logistics. Planning the best possible route is not as easy as it sounds. “In many cases, we will have a landmark and street name with a wrong pin code. We have to convert this information into latitude and longitude. For this, our systems need to understand and interpret the English language and build natural language processing systems,” says Rastogi. “Let us say you have to deliver a package before hitting the gym at 6pm. But if you reach the gym 5 minutes late, that is also fine. How do I make the system understand that it is better to reach the gym by 6.05pm instead of not delivering the package at all? In the real world, if a truck is full, the driver can keep one package next to his seat. It is important in the real world to understand what that soft threshold is. It is important for the system to understand this world fuzziness,” explains Rastogi. Companies provide Locus the origin of the package, destination and expected time of delivery. Locus sources all the possible routes from Google Maps or sifts through data on past deliveries. This data is then processed, factoring in weather information, traffic, historical data on time taken to cover the distance, etc. to arrive at a few best routes. If the client is new, logistics solutions take about three months. Are the companies willing to wait? “We haven’t lost a single client yet,” says Rastogi. —By Sayan Chakraborty Mad Street Den’s co-founder Ashwini Asokan. Photo: Hemant Mishra/Mint Mad Street Den, Chennai Investment: $1.5 million from Exfinity Ventures and growX Ventures, in addition to an undisclosed sum from Sequoia Capital. The team: The husband-wife duo of Ashwini Asokan and Anand Chandrasekaran. Asokan, who previously worked for Intel Corp., and her husband Anand Chandrasekaran, a neuroscientist, who is the firm’s chief technology officer, both worked in the US before deciding to return to India in 2013. Intelligence factor: One of the several AI start-ups trying to improve the retail experience in India. Asokan, among a handful of people in India who speak openly about the skewed gender representation in the start-up business, runs Mad Street Den, a start-up that is trying to make the business of retail more efficient. The start-up’s main product, Vue.ai, offers visual search technology, product recommendations, and personalized home pages based on the tastes of individual shoppers, among other features. The AI-based technology offers several benefits to customers: uploading pictures and finding matching products, browsing in a way that is specifically tailored to their tastes, discovering products they may otherwise not have been aware of, and reducing the amount of time they spend shopping or having a more efficient shopping experience. As the customer experience improves, it results in better conversion rates for retailers. Vue.ai also helps retailers reduce cataloguing errors and product returns and make merchandising more customer-friendly. The company also hopes to turn omni-channel retail, so far a pipe dream, into reality. Mad Street Den currently works with firms such as furniture e-commerce site HipVan in Singapore and fashion e-tailers such as TataCliq, Craftsvilla and Voonik in India. The Chennai-based company is one of the tens of start-ups selling efficiency-improvement tech to retailers. Others, such as Stylumia, Staqu and SnapShopr, offer similar services. Mad Street Den, however, is expanding into gaming and other businesses this year. “Scale markets globally, scale our AI systems and establish ourselves as the first computer vision business that’s making money on scale,” says Asokan. She sounds the part of a change-the-world entrepreneur. “To build generalizable AI is one of the founding principles of why we started this. The second part of the founding principle is making AI accessible to millions of people across the globe. Not just to build it, but actually to build it on the scale that applies to people across the world. The first one represents Anand’s vision, the second one represents why I am here,” says Asokan. —By Sadhana Chathurvedula Niki.ai’s founders (from left) Sachin Jaiswal, Nitin Babel, Keshav Prawasi and Shishir Modi. Photo: Hemant Mishra/Mint Niki.ai (Techbins Solutions PVT. LTD), Bengaluru Investment: Niki.ai raised undisclosed seed investments from Ronnie Screwvala’s Unilazer Ventures, Tata Sons chairman emeritus Ratan Tata and Haresh Chawla of True North between October 2015 and December 2016. Niki.ai declined to disclose the quantum of funds raised. The team: Founded by four Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, alumni. Before starting the venture, Sachin Jaiswal, chief executive officer at Niki.ai, had co-founded InnovAccer Inc., a healthcare analytics company in the US. Technology head Keshav Prawasi was a software engineer at Amazon; Nitin Babel, who looks after support and marketing, worked for Ipsos, a global market and opinion research firm; and business head Shishir Modi came from a stint at a multinational energy distribution company. Intelligence factor: Niki is used for over 20 services, including hotel, cab and movie ticket bookings, ordering food and paying bills. If you’re rude, it will reprimand you and can even block you. Chatbots—like Apple’s Siri and Google’s Allo—are essentially computer programs that make human-like conversation with users. Banks, retailers and others use chatbots to answer basic customer queries and help users navigate their websites. Niki, one of the early chatbots developed in India, is designed to serve as a virtual shopkeeper that assists in the purchase of products and services. It can help you book a cab, order food from the nearest restaurant, book tickets for movies and events, and pay general utility bills. Flight bookings, payments for insurance and courier services will be introduced soon. Niki was conceived in early 2015 and rolled out to customers in October that year. It works on a series of sophisticated algorithms that understand human language by breaking it down into structured queries that the machine can understand. Another set of codes then generates a response relevant to the query, and this goes on till the task is accomplished. The core of the platform rests on language-recognition systems. “We started with off-the-shelf solutions like Stanford CoreNLP and went on to develop our own custom models,” says Babel. These were developed by studying the interactions on Niki and constantly tweaking algorithms to accurately determine what the user is looking for. Currently, Niki has over 300,000 users; 50-60% of them are in the age group of 24-35, 20-30% in the 18-24 age group, and about 10% are over 35. “We have been collecting the conversational commerce data for Indian customers for the last two years. Close to 50 million interactions have happened on Niki and have been used to improve the accuracy from 50-60% to 90%,” says Babel. He says the company earns revenue by charging a commission on each service or product purchased on Niki. Earlier this year, the company launched a software development kit that allows other sites and apps to integrate Niki with their platforms. It is available on HDFC Bank’s OnChat, the Oxigen Wallet app and the operating system of Intex smartphones (as the LFTY feature). The company will launch 20 more partnerships soon. — By Yuvraj Malik Zenatix’s co-founders (seated in front, from left) Amarjeet Singh and Vishal Bansal.

LTD, Gurugram Investment: Rs11.5 crore from pi Ventures, Blume Ventures, Rahul Khanna, managing partner, Trifecta Capital, Rajan Anandan, vice-president and managing director of Google, South-East Asia and India, and Snapdeal co-founders Kunal Bahl and Rohit Bansal. The team: Vishal Bansal, who worked as portfolio manager at ING Insurance; Rahul Bhalla, who worked in the legal outsourcing industry; and Amarjeet Singh, who worked as an assistant professor at the Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology, Delhi. Intelligence factor: Zenatix helps businesses save energy and cut down their electricity bills. Zenatix, a team of 35, works with large chains of quick-service restaurants (QSRs), bank ATMs and retail stores which have anywhere from 200 to more than 1,000 stores/outlets. A Zenatix client that has around 1,000 stores, each 2,500 sq. ft in area, used to spend Rs80-100 crore annually on electricity. Zenatix helps it save 10-30% of this amount. All these outlets have electrical assets such as ATM machines, air conditioners, and ovens and exhaust fans in the case of QSR kitchens. When it comes to ACs in a workplace, someone would generally switch them on at the start of the day and switch them off at the close of day. “The person is not equipped with the intelligence that, based on the occupancy of the space, temperature outside and even time of day, the usage of AC can be optimized. Or consider, if an ATM breaks down, it could take a few hours to days (depending on where it is located) to get it fixed,” says Bansal. “If we know that a grocery store or an ATM sees a minimum footfall during certain hours of a day, one set of ACs may be switched off to maintain the same ambient temperature inside,” he adds. Through its WattMan device, Zenatix captures data points such as the time of day, electricity consumed, and outside temperature, every 30 seconds. Based on this, it can reboot an ATM when it stops working, predict when an AC in a retail store will break down or needs servicing, and automate its switching on and off. Zenatix plans to double WattMan’s presence to 1,000 sites by June, as its existing clientele of over 20 companies hands over more stores/outlets to Zenatix. As of April, it had installed WattMan at 500 sites. Zenatix wants to build accurate computing and predictive models. “Imagine if a door to cold storage is left open, and as soon as it reflects a change of temperature, the door closes automatically. That’s the kind of advanced temperature profiling we want to build.... We want that when an air conditioner is not working properly, the correlation between temperature and electricity can tell us whether it is the gas, filter or compressor causing the problem,” says Bansal. — By Arushi Chopra Active.ai’s co-founder Ravi Shankar. Photo: Hemant Mishra/Mint Active.ai (Active Intelligence PTE LTD), Bengaluru and Singapore Investment: $3.5 million (around Rs22.5 crore) from Kalaari Capital and IDG Ventures India. The team: Ravi Shankar, chief executive officer and co-founder, has worked with banks such as HDFC Bank, ABN AMRO and YES Bank; Shankar Narayanan, the chief operating officer, founded the start-ups Fastacash and Cazh and co-founded Tagit; Parikshit Paspulati, chief technology officer, founded Finoculus and co-founded Tagit. Narayanan and Paspulati are Singapore-based, where the company is headquartered; more than half the workforce is based in Bengaluru. Intelligence factor: Let’s say, you need to know your account balance and don’t really have the time to walk into an ATM or even look into the bank’s app. Send a message to the bank through Facebook Messenger or WhatsApp and you will get the reply. Chances are high that your bank is using Active.ai platform, an intelligent interface that allows banks and consumers to connect over chat. Photo: Hemant Mishra/Mint Shankar, Narayanan and Paspulati have all worked with banks and fintech start-ups. Perhaps naturally then, Active.ai wants to improve customer engagement for banks and insurance companies. “Say you type, I lost my wallet. What will the bank understand? There is no transaction for ‘lost my wallet’. The system will understand that it means all the cards are gone. The bank will say I will block your card,” says Shankar. “Now, let’s say you are at an airport. The bank will say, ‘Looks like you are at an airport and travelling. Can we help you with a (travel) insurance policy?’ The ability to hold this conversation is what we bring to banks.” According to Shankar, Active.ai will help banks almost halve their customer engagement costs. Active.ai essentially offers a platform that has chatbots through which banks can interact with customers. The more customers interact, the more the Artificial Intelligence behind Active.ai’s platform will learn about them and the better it will be able to offer personalized advice and service, increasing customer engagement and loyalty. Usage for consumers can range from opening an account and getting balance information, to transferring money to other accounts or paying bills. Banks, on the other hand, can push relevant products and services, drawing on the data available on customer history. The bot can be integrated via various channels, including WeChat, LINE, Kakao Talk, Facebook Messenger, Amazon Echo and Siri. Largely, the company sources data from banks and other partner financial institutions, apart from Envestnet | Yodlee, a data aggregation and analytics platform. Active.ai has developed algorithms that can convert unstructured messages, i.e. input by consumers, into structured instructions for banks using natural language processing and machine learning. “Say you are typing on Facebook. This is unstructured messaging. We convert that into entities and intent. For instance, you type, ‘I want to know what is happening in my account.’ Here, entity is the account and intent is ‘I want to know’. Our algorithm captures this and it then figures out the context. That is the third component. So the system will think this guy has an account and wants to know what is happening there, I should get his balance,” explains Shankar. In India, the company counts Axis Bank as a client; deals with several others are in the pipeline. It says it has already signed up with banks in Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand. Discussions with banks in North America are under way, says Shankar. “Apart from reducing the costs of customer engagement, banks can cross-sell or upsell. It helps them retain customers with higher engagement and client service levels. It also helps banks reach out to new consumers, especially the youth, via chat,” he adds. Having started with the banking sector, Active.ai now plans to work with insurance companies to boost customer engagement. —By Sayan Chakraborty SigTuple’s founding team (from left) Tathagato Rai Dastidar, Rohit Kumar Pandey and Apurv Anand. Photo: Hemant Mishra/Mint Sigtuple, Bengaluru Investment: $6.4 million, from investors such as Accel Partners, Axilor Ventures, IDG Ventures, pi Ventures, Endiya Partners, VH Capital and Flipkart founders Sachin and Binny Bansal. The team: Started by former American Express executives Rohit Kumar Pandey, Tathagato Rai Dastidar and Apurv Anand. Intelligence factor: SigTuple is helping hospitals and healthcare centres improve the speed and accuracy of blood reports. Photo: Hemant Mishra/Mint In medicine and healthcare, accuracy and time are important factors. A delay of even half an hour can result in loss of life; and a wrong diagnosis could prove tragic. SigTuple is looking to address both these issues through its AI-powered Manthana platform, which can, among other things, analyse blood samples and generate medical reports in less than 10 minutes—and with complete accuracy, according to Pandey, who is also the chief executive officer. “From the moment someone reaches the labs and provides a blood sample, the total time taken for the generation of a report and review by a pathologist is less than 10 minutes,” says Pandey. Manthana is being used by a number of mid- to large-sized hospitals, diagnostics labs, and eyecare and healthcare chains. Among their prominent clients is Anand Diagnostic Labs, one of Bengaluru’s biggest chains, which uses one of SigTuple’s digitization tools to analyse blood samples. Now the team is working towards making Manthana available for a complete diagnosis. Photo: Hemant Mishra/Mint At present, Manthana can analyse blood, semen and urine samples—Pandey says the platform is capable of generating complete blood reports, which typically analyse 21 different parameters, including red and white blood cell count and platelets. For example, SigTuple has used the AI-powered platform to analyse a blood sample to catch a malarial parasite, says Pandey. Accuracy is another area that the team hopes to improve on—currently, SigTuple’s accuracy rates differ for different solutions. For instance, accuracy rates for urine samples stand at around 85-88%. For SigTuple, evolving from traditional analytics to machine learning was a crucial pivot, since it wanted to create tools that could analyse medical cases, just like a doctor would. “Earlier, the algorithms that were being used, as soon as they saw new data, the results used to get skewed. With the advancement of AI, as more and more new data keeps coming in, the machine continues to learn—like humans. And it starts generating solutions, which was not possible with traditional algorithms,” says Pandey. The limitations of traditional algorithms were addressed by machine learning, where a machine is trained to mimic a human brain—somewhat like IBM’s Watson. For example, a hospital chain which wants to open a lab in a tier-II or tier-III city usually has to spend hundreds of crores of rupees on hardware, equipment and medical experts. With SigTuple’s platforms such as Manthana, hospitals can scale up in smaller cities and towns. Since it also eliminates the need for labs to ship blood samples to different locations, it helps diagnostic chains save on logistical costs and, more crucially, time. “There is no need for a manual review by a pathologist by putting a slide under a microscope. Second, remote diagnosis is made possible, because the pathologist need not be sitting next to the microscope or blood slide. No shipping is required—the pathologist can be anywhere,” says Pandey. SigTuple gets most of its data from the labs and hospitals that it works with. Over the next year, a top priority for the company is to gather more data through more such partnerships to improve the accuracy of Manthana. —By Anirban Sen Livemint Topics: India AI Artificial Intelligence Machine Learning start-ups More From Livemint READ MORE Philippine’s Duterte says China’s Xi threatened war if he pushed sea dispute Kochi Metro inauguration: Pinarayi to think of alternatives only if PM Modi says no GST rates: 83 services exempt, 13 in 5 % slab First Published: Sat, May 20 2017. 08 58 AM IST Editor's Picks 10 standout start-ups taking an AI leap in India Do SBI’s fourth quarter results indicate a turnaround in economy?

Some Pixel owners are experiencing random software freezes Michael Crider Follow View All Posts 2016/12/23 4:30pm PDTDec 23, 2016 88 Plus 1 on G+ 199 Share on Facebook 105 Share on Twitter Total Shares392 Google News Pixel Pixel XL Google's trying to market the new Pixel and Pixel XL phones as premium, market-leading devices, and a big part of that is nailing the software experience. Alas, quite a few owners of Google's first-party phones aren't feeling particularly premium as of late: this lengthy discussion on Google's product forum documents a series of as-yet-unexplained software freezes and lockups. Commonalities among the users seem to be a complete freeze of the interface that lasts several seconds to several minutes, including disappearing navigation buttons. Google's support team is aware of the problem and replying to at least some direct support requests, but replies in the forum thread are somewhat few and far between. Early responses seemed to indicate that a third-party app, Life360's family locator, was the source of the issue. And indeed, quite a few users of the app have eliminated the problem by disabling or uninstalling the app - though that's hardly ideal, since many of them considered it essential for keeping a handle on kids or other family members. But others are experiencing the same debilitating freezes without ever having installed that particular app, so it seems that whatever the software problem is, there are multiple ways to encounter it. A frozen screenshot from forum poster Triangles - note the blank Home and Recents buttons. Pixel and Pixel XL owners are having the same problem, which might indicate a common hardware-software issue. While it's not so widespread that it appears to be happening to all Pixel phones, it looks like a few hundred owners are seeing it at the very least. Aside from that specific Life360 app (and perhaps disabling location services, also less than ideal), there doesn't appear to be a reliable way to solve the problem at the time of writing. Drop into the thread if you're experiencing it, or contact Google's Pixel support directly.  Source: Google Product forums Thanks: Jonny Tags bugs freeze frozen Google hang pixel pixel xl support subscribe ...

Marcelove "wouldn't know who I am" Lol 😂 +1 Joe Mihalich Thanks for publishing this story. I would be willing to bet at this point that there are thousands of people having this issue, but writing it off to a blip or whatever because it may be happening infrequently to them. Bas Keetelaar Well, let's hope Google doesn't take the Nexus 9 approach. HiroRoshi The irony is that CM14.1 and unofficial Nougat ports are more stable on older devices. FeelThePoveR It's not irony, it's just the developers know more about older devices, are more accustomed to them and probably developed some of their own stuff for it (i.e. new audio hal for my old M7). MicroNix But, but, but Google designed the Pixel and own the software FeelThePoveR But... There were some rumors that the pixels were kinda rushed (and it would explain i.e. lens flare issue or lack of waterproofing) so... that could count as an excuse (not a good one but still) LoL :P MicroNix Kinda reaching there ;) likurges no excuse for the price, if it was rushed the price should be lower, otherwise there shouldn't be problems like these. and don't start with "every premium phone has issues" because it's inexcusable for ANY phone in this price range to have stupid problems like this Pinga_dulce I don't care if the phone cost $150. At that price range I don't expect premium built, bells and whistles. However, whatever it offers, better work flawlessly. I get tired of people making excuses for these OEMS, as if the offerings are for free. You buy a Corrolla, it may not have the horse power, BT, or leather seat, but there is a performance expectation. navjack Tell that to my Moto g 1st gen on republic wireless. Oh god it's horrible. Zero memory management. Constant issues just doing normal system processes. 5723alex . CM is dead: Cyanogen services shutting down As part of the ongoing consolidation of Cyanogen, all services and Cyanogen-supported nightly builds will be discontinued no later than 12/31/16. The open source project and source code will remain available for anyone who wants to build CyanogenMod personally. Peter Silie Which would be? Bas Keetelaar Doing nothing actually. Nexus 9 has this problem where it would crash and show a white screen and sometimes it makes a loud noise as well. Google barely acknowledges this problem (maybe b/c it's a hardware problem) Michael Hannigan Never had it on my Nexus 9s. Probably an isolated problem. Those are meaningless dcdttu Uninstalled Life 360, problem solved. Told them weeks ago. Syukri Lajin That is a workaround, the problem is not solved. Apps shouldn't cause a reboot(unintentionally), the problem is in the operating system not the app. dcdttu Dear Vulcan, Hi. It's a figure of speech. Love Life360 and wish they'd fix it. Android User Michael Hannigan Sounds more like the problem is with the app. Your reasoning seems a bit odd. It's one app causing the problem. Syukri Lajin It's a simple logic actually. When a broken radio inside your car cause the whole engine stops running in the middle of the road, you fix the engine not to allow it to happen again, not just the radio. I'm not saying the app isn't problematic, but the operating system should not have crashed together with the app. vzwuser76 If the radio is causing the engine to do, fixing the engine has nothing to do with it. If it's say a short to ground that's drawing down the electrical system, you find the short and eliminate it. The engine most likely would have nothing to do with it. Sure you could put a beefier electrical system in there, but a short would still take the engine down, I might just take longer to do so. Or it might damage something else like the alternator. The point is, sometimes a little thing can take down sparge thing. In this case, if an improperly coded app is causing the issue, you could probably modify the OS the allow it to work. But if there are only 1 or 2 apps that are coded incorrectly then why modify the OS for them if all the other apps function correctly? You go to the source of the problem and fix that. How do I know this? Because I'm an electronics technician and spent 12 years troubleshooting electronic issues. If you don't find the source of the issue and repair it, or modify non-issue complements to try and fix the problem, you may end up with more issues than you started with. Syukri Lajin the problem is inside the operating system, not just the app. What should happen is android would detect that the app is not responding and shows the App not responding dialog. The operating system should not crash together with it. vzwuser76 And you know the problem is inside the OS for certain? Then why don't you fix it? If the app is sending data, a request, or a query the OS doesn't recognize, it might cause it to have a problem if the OS is trying to implement the command from the app but can't because it doesn't recognize it. Or it could be something else entirely causing the issue. But first things first. You find the root cause of the issue. If it's an app, it's up to the developer to determine why their app is causing the issue. And because so few phones are affected by the issue, that leans more to it being less about the OS and more about it being one or a handful of apps. Sure you can modify the OS to handle the problem better, but if the issue is with the app, and if it would've been coded properly in the first place, the issue would never have presented itself. And even if you fix this issue with the app and then modify the OS to compensate, what happens when a different issue occurs due to a different poorly coded app? Modify the OS again? Keep that up and the modifications made to the OS could negatively affect other apps that weren't affected previously. When troubleshooting an issue, you try to make as small of a change as possible as to not affect another part of the system that IS running properly. I've seen it happen before where someone decides to make a widespread change and while it fixes the original issue, now they have multiple new issues. One step forward, five steps back. There's an old saying, "If it ain't broke, don't fix it." Syukri Lajin You seems to know a lot about the problem. Why don't you solve it? vzwuser76 I listed POSSIBLE causes and basic troubleshooting techniques. I've listed why I know something about how you go about troubleshooting an issue, what do you do that qualifies your statements? Syukri Lajin How can i argue with an engineer with 12 years of experience that seems to know everything. :D vzwuser76 You didn't answer the question. Btw I'm a technician, not an engineer. Engineers design the system, I fix them when something goes wrong. But maybe I should just talk out of my ass and hope for the best, seems to work for you. Syukri Lajin I don't argue with someone that have had his mind set. It's pointless. :D vzwuser76 What mindset? That they have experience with issues such as this? But if I'm wrong and you have more experience than I do, say so and I will gladly defer to you. Syukri Lajin I should stop now. Nothing is more of waste of time than arguing to prove that the other person is wrong. :D vzwuser76 Then prove it. If I'm wrong then back up what you're saying. MicroNix Your logic here is incorrect. If the radio causes the engine to die, then there's a problem with the infrastructure allowing that to occur as well as a problem with the radio. The radio should be on a proper fuse that should blow before taking down the engine's electrical. I'm sure there should be a way for an OS to have safeguards like that as well, but I don't build operating systems and don't pretend to. Max If a radio is *so* broken it manages to take down my whole engine, you can bet your can of tuna I'm taking that thing out of my car. Yes, it'd be nice if the engine shrugged off anything the radio could do to it, but if *all* the other car parts have no effect on the engine, I'm blaming the offending app more. Michael Hannigan It depends. If you run 240V AC backwards down those wires, you might have issues with that car. If you put water in the gas tank, well, "no va". Syukri Lajin too bad stupidity can't be fixed. not much anyone can do about that kind of problems. :D Michael Hannigan I know - you are destined to be stupid for a lifetime. How I pity thee. navjack I put water in my tank all the time in order to build an immunity Michael Hannigan BTW, I've seen plenty of faulty alarm systems drain a car battery and leave the car unusable. Fault - car or alarm?? Phil Kulak If an app can take down the OS, the problem is with the OS and maybe the app. This isn't 1995 anymore when a single crappy executable can bring on a BSOD. vzwuser76 Really, because wasn't there a story just this year where typing in a particular phrase in a text message or something similar and it caused the system to crash? Ajay Shah And Apple patched that bug in iOS, because it's a fault of the OS, nothing else. vzwuser76 I never said that wasn't an OS issue. I was really being to someone who said a single executable couldn't bring down an OS anymore. That was a separate comment from the discussion about if the issue was the app or the OS. Michael Hannigan When it's a single poorly coded app, then it is a problem with the app. The real and only problem here is quality control with what is released in the app store. Phil Kulak No. I don't think you really understand the design goals of a modern OS. Michael Hannigan Teach me, Phil. Phil Kulak Sure! Well, I'm not going to write a book just for you, but go ahead and start reading here: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_space Michael Hannigan I will only bieve what comes directly from you, Phil. Wikipedia doesn't cut it. Artem Russakovskii Some people said that they didn't have Life 360 installed. Michael Hannigan Those people are lying. thecatch33 You, sir, must have been the anchor of your debate team. abc Oh really? I see the problem now - you're a fucking idiot. Michael Hannigan Your comment is invalid. I am actually a genius. dcdttu I'm sure there are a myriad of reasons why millions of phones could have issues. I'm also certain Life360 was my particular issue. No reboots in 2 weeks without it. vzwuser76 So maybe another app has the same issue? And from reading this story on another site, the amount of affected users is anywhere from less than a hundred to a few hundred, in other words not that many. So the most logical way to narrow it down would be to have users who don't have the Life360 app installed compare apps they do have installed and see if there is a common app(s) installed and see if uninstalling them solves the issue. If it does, the next step would be to have the developers of those apps look into the matter and see if they can find a common thread that may be causing the issue. Zsolt V Or it's simply some people with agendas? Just add the likely. abc People with agendas like you? Just adding to your fact free argument. thecatch33 I have a Pixel XL with no Life360 and it has locked up on me multiple times. I wasn't aware that I had any agenda other than wanting my phone to stop freezing. Zsolt V Yup, I believe everything I read on the internet, because there are no people around with agendas. dcdttu Just a friendly update: I've uninstalled Life360 for 1 week now and it's not locked up / rebooted once. This is on 2 different Pixels, btw. It's totally Life360 doing it to me, not sure what the other users issue is but it's a big cellular world out there so it could be anything. master94 If you wants a true nexus like experience with minimum bugs you should honestly just buy w/e OnePlus is making. Pixel is very beta like and probably better for people who don't mind bugs. Bob Marley That's a very bold statement considering OnePlus's track record with updates. james fuston And touchscreen reliability. Marco Well you can expect few software bugs on a 450$ phone? Yes. Also OnePlus is aware of these bugs and will address them in future updates. Can you expect so many software bugs from a $1000 phone than promises an iPhone-like experience? ... james fuston I haven't heard of any Pixel updates that broke the touchscreen for multiple users. Manjot Singh well that track record is changing Alex Dueppen Kind of. james fuston because they divorced the software company they were married to? lol k master94 Again I said Nexus like as in near stock with few bugs. I didnt mean as having the newest version of Android. Kyle Gospodnetich Looks like we've all forgotten about the faulty design of the OnePlus One that lead to countless users with touchscreen issues, and the similarly faulty design of the OnePlus Two that made the fingerprint sensor not work. I had to fix my OnePlus One myself with a piece of tape after OnePlus refused to honor the warranty. Knowledgeborn Allah I don't think you're considering the fact that the Pixel XL costs almost DOUBLE the price of the OnePlus 3T (which is the more expensive one, by the way)... I'd be fine having a few bugs on a solid device that only cost $429. I don't expect that same thing on a phone that costs $800. Kyle Gospodnetich "My touchscreen doesn't work at all" is not a "few bugs" or a "solid device". It's an unfixable hardware flaw and a warranty policy that won't fix it. Price has nothing to do with this. Knowledgeborn Allah I agree... But, then again, I don't know anybody with the OnePlus 3 or 3T who said their touchscreen stopped working. Everybody I know with the devices have said that their devices work flawlessly, at least for the most part. And, for around $400, you can't really beat that. PixelXLellence ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ That's a idiotic point. A $49 Blu phone achieves pretty much everything all other smartphones do, but the experience is vastly different from device to device. Knowledgeborn Allah Your statement is idiotic, and it's a shame that you don't realize it... If a $49 BLU phone had bugs, most people would be willing to overlook them. Why? Because the phone costs $49! Most people agree with the concept of 'getting what you pay for'. That's why, if that same phone costs $800+, most people would be less likely to overlook the issues it has. Why? Because it costs $800+! Is that really hard to understand? Michael Hannigan Yeah... But the same phone wouldn't cost $49 and $800. So your point is moot. Knowledgeborn Allah Actually, it's not. A clear example can be said about the Pixel devices as stemming from the Nexus brand. The Pixel devices are pretty much on par with the Nexus devices from last year, just with updated specs. Yet, the price skyrocketed. They're essentially selling their $500 smartphone for $800. Again, people are more willing to tolerate bugs on a $500 phone than an $800 one. Michael Hannigan No. We already figured out that when you take into consideration the value of the cables, the Pixel is only costing you $500. Knowledgeborn Allah The Pixel is only costing you $500? Seriously? Have you looked at the prices on the Google Store? That's where most people buy their Pixel phones... You're an idiot, guy. 🤦🏾‍♂️ Kevin Turabian http://mashable.com/2016/12/22/iphone-7-plus-camera-black-screen-issue/#_f3UpY5bHkq9 Has Apple admitted anything regarding the above? Phone's have problems, especially when you sell millions; these are complicated devices. Nobody's telling anybody to overlook issues, Google has admitted the issue and is going to look into it, which is awesome for a bug that has only been experienced by a relatively small number of users. That's what I expect as flagship support. Knowledgeborn Allah Flagship support? I don't know if Apple has acknowledged that issue or not. But, when it comes to practical acknowledgement, any iPhone 7 user having these issues can walk into an Apple store and have their device repaired or replaced on the spot. "That's what I expect as flagship support." Michael Hannigan Why do so many people claim that the Pixel XL is an $800 phone? That isn't what the phone costs. Knowledgeborn Allah The Pixel XL costs $769 for the base model of 32gb of storage, which would be around $800 after taxes. Most people would probably opt for the 128gb model because of general storage capacity for apps and services. At least that's what I did. That actually costs MORE than $800... The regular Pixel costs $649, and the 128gb model is $749, which is going to be over $800 after taxes too. So, I'm not sure what you're talking about. Yes, the Pixel is priced at $800+ for most variants. WestSiide So how much exactly does it cost? Manjot Singh trust me,buy a op3 and you wont regret it. Knowledgeborn Allah Agreed. Not for you http://www.androidpolice.com/2016/08/02/nexus-5-users-are-encountering-serious-volume-bugs-after-the-july-ota/ http://www.androidpolice.com/2016/12/20/some-nexus-6ps-have-developed-a-battery-early-shutoff-problem-and-its-becoming-a-safety-issue/ http://www.androidpolice.com/2015/11/30/bug-watch-vehicle-bluetooth-call-audio-problems-being-reported-on-all-four-nexus-phones-with-marshmallow/ http://www.androidpolice.com/2014/03/11/bug-watch-nfc-service-repeatedly-dies-on-nexus-devices-running-kitkat-a-fix-is-planned/ http://www.androidpolice.com/2015/04/13/some-nexus-5-owners-afflicted-by-camera-crashes-following-android-5-1-update/ TL;DR - the implication that nexus devices were bug-free is laughable. MJ No one said Pixel/Nexus phones are bug free? The OP said the Pixel was beta quality (ridiculous) and OnePlus phones are almost problem free (yeah no). Should I also post some links? Did we already forget the horrible memory management issues with the OnePlus 3 at launch? LOL For what is it is worth, I have had none of those issues with my Pixel XL. Knowledgeborn Allah I had plenty of bugs on my Nexus devices from time to time, but I was alright with that because the phones were cheap. That's not the case for the Pixel and Pixel XL... In other words, bugs are easy to excuse on a cheap device. But, when you're paying close to $1,000 for a phone and accessories, you should be getting better quality for your money. MJ I hate to break this to you but Samsung flagship phones and Apple phones have always had various software and hardware issues like any other phones. Knowledgeborn Allah You don't remember Apple's old slogan, "It just works"? I'm sure there are lines and lines of iPhone customers who would disagree with you. The iPhone 7 Plus is the first iOS device I've ever owned, and I've yet to have a single issue with it. At all. No slowdowns, no random reboots, no app crashes, nothing. So, I'm not sure what you're talking about. When it comes to Samsung, their philosophy is different. Yes, they have bugs from time to time, but you're getting a ridiculous amount of features in their devices so that you'll overlook the small issues you may have with them. And, either way, those issues don't compare to the Pixel phones. With Samsung phones, a lot of people experience issues with it. But they're not a bunch of different issues, and new ones definitely don't pop up this frequently and consistently. If the fingerprint scanner stopped working one week, the camera refused to open the next week, and the screen randomly freezes the week after that, and more and more issues pop up every subsequent week after that, it probably wouldn't take long to realize that there's something wrong with your phone. Michael Hannigan I think the iPhone slogan was "It just barely works". Knowledgeborn Allah Spoken like somebody who's probably never used an iOS device... 🤦🏾‍♂️ Michael Hannigan I own iOS devices, terrorist. Knowledgeborn Allah Terrorist? 😂 Did you know that almost 90% of terrorist attacks in the United States are committed by white men? Figures... Lol Michael Hannigan You must have your own definition of terrorism. It's the 10% that you don't want to mention - things like the World Trade center being blown up - that's done by Muslims. That's terrorism, and that vast majority of it is done by Muslims and endorsed by other Muslims. If you don't want that to be true, keep your fellow Muslims under control instead of encouraging them and turning a blind eye. Knowledgeborn Allah First of all, I'm not Muslim... But, being honest with you, what do you call somebody who shoots up a school? What do you call somebody who plans and facilitates the construction of a dirty bomb to blow up parts of New York and Washington DC? What do you call somebody who shoots up a church full of unarmed people? What do you call somebody who writes a manifesto about how technology is evil and blows people up to "save the planet"? What do you call somebody who shoots up an abortion clinic to justify Christian fundamentalism? What do you call somebody who shoots up a movie theater or a mall because of a political ideology? Oh, I get it. They didn't tell "Allahu Akbar" before they did it, so they're exempt, right? If it's in the name of good old "Jeezus", it's all good, eh? Riiiiiiiiiiiight... 🤷🏾‍♂️ Michael Hannigan Muslim. Your name has Allah in it. Not my fault. Knowledgeborn Allah Cool with me, bud... But, based on statistics, and judging by your picture, 90% of the terrorists throughout the United States look just like you. "Not my fault." Maybe you should convert to Islam so you wouldn't look so dangerous, lol. Michael Hannigan No. Jesus was a sociopath. He was dilusional. Basically your average cult leader. Bad news. Knowledgeborn Allah Maybe you need to study up, buddy. You said Jesus was a sociopath AND that he was "dilusional" (grade school clearly didn't help you out with spelling). The problem? Sociopaths aren't delusional. Make up your mind about what you want him to be, and then get back to me. 😂 Michael Hannigan Bzzzzzzt! You need to do the studying. A delusional sociopath is a real thing. Look it up. Disappointed that you wouldn't Google that before making yourself look dumb. Knowledgeborn Allah Again, and as usual, spoken like somebody who has no idea what he's talking about... Sociopaths are NOT delusional. Maybe you should take a psychology course. You're sounding more and more like an idiot with every word you type. And, to think, this all started because you were dumb enough to bash the iPhone without ever using an iOS device. You made yourself look so stupid, your only response was, "You're a terrorist." That alone shows how intelligent you are. 😂 Michael Hannigan I think you must mean to say that sociopaths are not NECESSARILY delusional. But there is a diagnosis referred to as "Delusional Sociopath" in DSM-V. I'm a psychiatrist you moron. Learn to pick your fights. Knowledgeborn Allah 😂 This just keeps getting better and better, lol. Again, modern psychology clearly determines that sociopaths are NOT delusional. Do your homework, guy. If you're a psychiatrist, then you must suck at your job. Help yourself out. Prescribe yourself some lithium. You clearly need it. Michael Hannigan I have no idea where you get that from. What I gave you is right out of the DSM. Do you know what the DSM is? Knowledgeborn Allah I majored in psychology, moron. I know exactly what a sociopath is... I don't care what you Googled to try to substantiate your foolish ideas. If you don't know the difference between a psychopath and a psychotic, then you need to just bow out of this discussion now. Michael Hannigan In fact, here you go. One of the possible signs/symptoms of sociopathy from the DSM-V (what real doctors use) "Grandiose self image – They might see themselves as someone who is superior to others and sometimes even experiences delusions. A sociopath might see themselves as a fitting ruler of a country or even the world, but might also have delusional beliefs such as seeing themselves as a God or having super powers." Eat your words. Knowledgeborn Allah Having a grandiose self-image is not the same thing as being delusional. I thought you were a psychiatrist, lol... If you suffer from delusions of having super powers, that makes you PSYCHOTIC, not psychopathic or sociopathic. Do you even know the difference? 🤦🏾‍♂️ Michael Hannigan Psychotic delusions are distinctly different from sociopathic delusions. I was talking about Jesus. Which delusions could possibly apply to him?? ONLY sociopathic delusions. I'm not saying the man was hallucinating, you idiot. He had delusions of grandeur - that is a sociopathic trait. Now shut up and stop arguing this stupid point with me. I am correct. It's in the DSM. I've been doing this for years. I don't give a shit if you "majored" in psychology. I TEACH psychology in college. You simply are WRONG. Knowledgeborn Allah Dude, you're full of shit. It's pretty clear that you have no idea what you're talking about. I doubt you've ever opened a psychology textbook in your life. Modern psychology has concluded that sociopaths are not delusional, regardless of what you read online. But I don't even need to go that far. Even your perspective shows that you're lying. You're allegedly a psychiatrist, who teaches psychology, but you think having the name "Allah" somewhere in my screen name makes me a 'terrorist'? You think a Muslim Registry is going to become part of American law because 'Trump said so'? You sound like a bum in your mom's basement. Again, you flare up because you got exposed as being a liar and a loser, and your response is, "Well, you're a terrorist. Na nana booboo." And you expect me to believe that you're a psychiatrist? 😂 You're a clown, man. I know the story. You can be whoever you want to be on the internet, lol. Get a life, guy. Hopefully you find peace one day. Michael Hannigan Your argument is stupid. "Modern psychiatry concluded..." Makes no sense. These are names and symptoms that we attribute to a mental disorder. And that one symptom hasn't been removed from the diagnosis of sociopathy. We don't arbitrarily remove diagnostic markers from disorders, you fool. I don't know if you are really this ignorant, or just lying. Leave me alone, kid. Knowledgeborn Allah "Modern psychiatry"? Do you even know the difference between psychology and psychiatry? C'mon, man, this is getting ridiculous. And it's funny how you stick to the script you're using, because you already know that everything else you said makes you sound like an idiot. I mean, come on. What legitimate psychiatrist would EVER say that having the name "Allah" in a screen name, or even being a Muslim, makes someone a 'terrorist', especially while bragging about the US supposedly trying to create a "Muslim Registry"? You showed your stupidity as soon as you made that ridiculous assertion. That is all. I'm just hoping that you find peace one day, man. In the meantime, you should go out and get a real degree in something. You could even study psychology. You might learn something. Your mom's couch isn't going anywhere. It'll still be there when you get back. But until then, you should educate yourself. 😏 Michael Hannigan Both my parents died recently. Nice one. Knowledgeborn Allah I don't do internet sob stories. I can't validate your story as being true. So, that's that... My point still stands. If you were a legitimate psychiatrist, there's no way you would've said or believed the things you did. That's reality. You showed your bias and ignorance with your comments, and that completely eroded your credibility. I still encourage you to educate yourself, and I still hope you find peace someday. Peace is definitely something a civilized society can never have too much of. Michael Hannigan Do you live under a rock or something? You've never heard of a guy called President Elect Trump? You have never heard of his project to establish a Muslim Registry in his first 100 days in office? Why do you suppose he feels that Muslims need to register. Muslims. No one else. Why? Knowledgeborn Allah What are you talking about? The mainstream Republican party has built their entire platform on the establishment of fear. They've been doing it for decades. Where have you been? They gain mainstream appeal among their supporters by fear mongering and "encouraging" people to be afraid of the 'other' group. Adolf Hitler did the same thing in Germany in the 1930s and 1940s. Why do you think he did that? Were his victims really as dangerous as he made them out to be? I'm not going to go back and forth on this, man. People spew propaganda to accomplish an objective. All of these guys have an agenda, and their words and actions, even right now, are leading the country in a very dangerous direction. I recommend that you open your eyes and look around. If you're objective, it won't take you long to figure out what's happening. Since you want to challenge things on the basis of public perception, why do you think people disproportionately view Trump supporters as violent racists, bigots and criminals? Is that just coincidental? How did you contribute to that narrative (stereotype) when you saw the word Allah written as a screen name and instantly thought "terrorist"? Think about it. Michael Hannigan No need to. Facts are facts and we are building a Muslim Registry. Sorry if the facts upset you, but I presented them as facts. Knowledgeborn Allah OK, man. Good luck with that... 😂 Michael Hannigan The thing is - caring what everyone else thinks of you is weak and not the a way to success. Nobody really cares what you think about a Muslim Registry. In fact, I'm sure all terrorists hate the idea. But it's happening anyway. Now, as you say, you fear us. Well, if that's what it takes for my family to be safe, then Muslims can continue to fear us. Knowledgeborn Allah For your family to be safe? 😳 Dude, you're not getting it. If over 90% of the terrorists in the United States are white men, then how can you expect a Muslim Registry to stop terrorism? Think about that. You're not concerned about the 265 million guns floating around the country that are being used to kill people almost every day, but you're afraid of an airplane being flown by a Muslim pilot crashing into your house. How rational is that? But hey, that's your business, man. I'm not going to keep going on and on with this. Believe whatever you want. Duckfart You are a moron and should stop arguing. And just because you googled it, it doesn't make it so. You sir are a dip Shite, I know I googled it. alpha2beta http://www.dailywire.com/news/7441/7-statistics-you-need-know-about-black-black-crime-aaron-bandler Knowledgeborn Allah I don't get the point of this post... What does this have to do with the fact that over 90% of terrorist attacks in the United States are committed by white men? You're feeling bad about that and wanted to throw up figures about "black on black crime" that you found with a quick Google search? Classic projection. 😂 Here - I can do that too, lol... http://usuncut.com/black-lives-matter/black-on-black-crime/ alpha2beta Your definition of terrorism is different then others. If it's whites commiting a crime it's terrorism if it's blacks commiting a crime it's just regular crime nothing to see. Media doesn't even talk about it because it's racist to talk about black commiting crimes. Knowledgeborn Allah First of all, what does this have to do with Android, the Google Pixel, or anything related to that? Regarding what you just posted: You sound like an idiot, dude. I don't even know why you spoke on this, since you apparently don't even know the difference between crime and terrorism. Now you're trying to justify white terrorism (we can't deny that it is disproportionate) because other racial demographics of people commit crimes targeted towards their communities? Those aren't even close to being the same... I get it, though. Anything to somehow 'redeem your people', eh? Must be that inner-Skinhead kicking in. 😂 Have a good one, guy. alpha2beta You started talking about race buddy. Knowledgeborn Allah No, I made a statement of fact about TERRORISM, in response to that other guy's misguided views regarding it. He's been convinced of the idea that Muslims are terrorists, and that all terrorist attacks are committed by Muslims. I simply educated him on the facts - that the vast majority of terrorists in the United States are not Arabs. They're not Persian, Turkish, Pakistani, Palestinian, or anything else. They're not the "others". They're people who look just like him, who dress like him, who speak his language, who shop at the same stores he goes to. Racism is what stops people from acknowledging that, because everybody wants to see the "other" people as the bad guys. In reality, that's just not the case. alpha2beta Liberal ran news sites. The FBI own statistics show otherwise. Knowledgeborn Allah Umm, yeah... Because all the conservative and "alt-right" (neo-Nazi?) ones are so much better and more accurate, lol. Grow up, dude. All news sites are designed to spread a message, to push you in a certain direction, whether that's to the left or the right. Everybody has an agenda. If you don't know the difference between fact and fiction, research and propaganda, then I don't know what to tell you. Maybe you should educate yourself too. JPLoureiro Fucking reported, you piece of shit. Michael Hannigan Fact is, my country is compiling a Muslim Registry where all Muslims will be required to register so they can be monitored. That isn't being done for "no reason". Sorry, but facts are facts. Knowledgeborn Allah Dude, you're a moron. A "Muslim Registry" is never going to happen. Or are you dumb enough to believe everything you read on the internet? Your country? You mean the same one that clearly imposes in its constitution the FREEDOM OF RELIGION? Anybody who proposes the idea of banning or discriminating against people based on religion is about as "un-American" as you can possibly get... But hey, don't blame me. Take it up with the Founding Fathers. 🤷🏾‍♂️ JPLoureiro Don't really care about your country's political system and much less about your Nazi agenda when we're here trying out to help each other out so we can make Android with as it should. Knowledgeborn Allah By the way, how will this "Muslim Registry" happen exactly? Did you know that Islam is a religion? Did you know that somebody can convert to Islam (just like any other religion), becoming a Muslim, and then drop it the next day? Did you know that people can claim to be Muslims without actually being Muslims? Did you know that, if people ever came in and asked a Muslim, "Are you a Muslim?", he could very easily say "no" to avoid that so-called registry? What's the plan if that happens? I'm curious. 😂 alpha2beta My god every article about the Pixel phone I see you constantly talking about how much better Your iPhone 7 is and all of the extra features on the Galaxy s7. We get it stop trolling and move on if you have nothing useful to say. Knowledgeborn Allah Useful to say about the Pixel? Stay in your lane, bud... For the record, I never said the Pixel was a bad phone. In fact, I've said repeatedly that I have the Pixel XL, and I enjoy the software experience. It's just not worth its price. Don't get mad at me for that, blame Google. They're the ones who decided to price-gouge people for a mediocre phone because they put "stock Android" on it. Nickname303 I hate to break this to you but you run and hide like every other troll that acts tough on the internet, when someone gives you some of your own treatment. Your parents must be so proud that they raised such such a wimpy p*ssy! Maybe your father was a p*ssy too and that's why you are? See you later wimp Michael Hannigan LOL! Now it's a $1000 phone? Let's just round it up and say it's a $5000 phone? Knowledgeborn Allah 😂 I said a phone AND accessories... With that glass plate on the back of the phone, most people are going to get a case for the phone, which can run anywhere from $30 to $100. Most of the people I know who got the phone bought extra USB-C cables for it too, to put in their offices or cars, etc. Quality USB-C cables cost around $40+ right now. Those are just the basics. When you factor in taxes, shipping and general pricing of all these items, you'll be paying around $1,000. Would it be better if I rounded it down and said $900? I don't know how much money you have, but even $900 is a lot of money to me, and I live a pretty comfortable lifestyle. Michael Hannigan It comes with two USB cables. I'm not sure what kind of idiot would spend $40+ for another one. So, what you are saying is that Google gives you like $100 worth of USB cables with the phone? That's pretty good. And since no person in any state pays tax on Google Store orders, that brings the Pixel down to $500 and change when you consider the $100 worth of cables it includes. WestSiide Taxes are paid in cali. Knowledgeborn Allah As far as I know, taxes for products purchased from the Google Store are paid everywhere. jomcty Google charges taxes for purchases from NC. Michael Hannigan $100 for a fucking CASE!!!!???? ARE YOU INSANE????? Not for you I guess the TL;DR was too long for you? Hint: "implication" is a real word. Look it up. Nickname303 Hey MJ, I see you're still hiding from me! Why would you act all tough and then just hide like a girl? Well the only explanation is that you're a silly p*ssy that runs away crying when given some of their own medicine. Hide between your mother legs MJ like you're still at school lol. What an utter wimp MJ I have no issue with OnePlus but saying Pixel phones are beta quality is ridiculous. Nougat is the best Android release ever (maybe someday you guys will get it) and my Pixel XL has been problem free and just as fast/smooth as day one. BROKEN 1+ is a joke of a company. cheeto0 Its kind of the opposite. Oneplus is very beta like and the pixel is solid. I say get the oneplus though if you don't want to spend extra on a pixel. I had a oneplus 3 when it first came out and I had a lot of trouble, most was eventually fixed with updates. The pixel I have since launch with no problems. Adam no halos? lol even google acknowledged it and you have "no problems" Michael Hannigan W/e? What the hell lazy shorthand is that? Knowledgeborn Allah It means "whatever"... 😂 ck125 But I thought stock android doesn't have these issues? Only Samsung devices. Lol come on google TypoCorrecto Nice strawman...Try again kid. ck125 Sadly it's true. Everyone always says "get a nexus/pixel" it won't have the bugs skinned devices have. Nexus and pixel are the beta testers, always have been. Kevin Turabian Every device has at least some issues in a small number of devices especially when they sell in large numbers, no matter who manufactures it or provides the software. Samsung's latest phone's are excellent but the Pixel is the most complete Android phone ever provided and is the furthest thing from a beta test anybody could imagine. Early Nexus could maybe be seen as a beta test, but even later Nexus phones were excellent. MJ ALL phones have some issues... The fact is in my experience with Nexus devices and my Pixel XL is they have no more problems and run more smooth than what Samsung puts out six months later. Knowledgeborn Allah I'm not too sure about that one. It seems like new issues are popping up with the Pixel variants almost every week. It's almost like Google perfected the software enough for the reviews to come out, and then, after everybody hyped it up and said how great it is, Google just said, "F*ck it, we're done now. They're already hooked!" I'm not saying it's a terrible device by any means. But, even on skinned devices, new issues don't pop up this frequently. Software shouldn't be set to expire after a couple months. Seba Olivares I might have lost the 3,5mm jack but my iPhone 7 Plus works perfectly. Google trying to replicate the iOS experience is going to hell :) PixelXLellence ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ krApple iP7+ is a piece of shit compared to the XL. Pat yourself on the back for being a krApple Fashion-Firster. Nathan J The A10 SoC in the iPhone 7 "Fashionably" annihilates the Snapdragon 821 SoC. HTC has had a really bad year. I can't really blame people for wanting to believe in someone, but you can't blame someone for buying Apple over HTC. Especially after the HTC 10 bootloop fiasco. The iPhone 7 has reported issues of its own, but I'd rate it above either HTC flagship. The Pixel or the 10. PixelXLellence ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ Erm... you read "reviews", while I compare the iP7+ and Pixel XL every day IRL. The only "annihilating" that goes on is XL beating down the iP7+ in the ways it matters to me- pics, HD pic processing and a smooth-as-glass UX, smoother browsing and incredible battery efficiency. Nathan J Benchmarks, not reviews. But close enough. Use what works best for you and I'll do the same, but buying HTC is quite risky. I hope you can still get a stock Android phone on Verizon when I'm done with my iPhone 6s. I just hope it's not made by HTC and isn't huge. I have no need for a large phone. There day I do, I'll just get a tablet. PixelXLellence ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ And good luck to you, sir, in your endeavor. raazman Lol, the iPhone and iOS 10 have already gone to hell. MattPortland Really? I have not encountered any hellish issues and I run beta versions. raazman There are 3 iPhones in the family, I'm doing tech support for all 3. Apple has some horrible quality control nowadays. MattPortland Support in regards to? raazman Sim card errors, freezing, battery dying at 30℅, losing network connectivity, etc. Over the past few years there have been numerous issues that I've dealt with. I'm not saying Android is perfect, but it's been less of a hassle as long as you're buying flagship devices. MattPortland None of that has been a hassle for me or anyone I know with an iPhone. *shrug* raazman Yeah, just yesterday in was dealing with an iPhone 7 that kept saying sim card not inserted and then kept popping up the activation screen. It's been a headache. Knowledgeborn Allah ^^^Agreed 100%! I've never encountered a single problem with my iP7+. The software is smooth and buttery, the hardware is perfectly optimized, the CPU is the fastest on the market, and updates are pretty much instantaneous. And, to top it off, customer service is outstanding, to the degree that I can just walk into an Apple store and ask for help if I have any issues. The Pixel just can't compete with that right now. Geoff Johnson My iPhone 7+ has had apps freeze and crash much more often than my Pixel. Knowledgeborn Allah What version of iOS are you using? I've had the iPhone 7+ for months, and I've never encountered as much as a single stutter or hiccup on my phone... If you're having that many issues, you can always go to an Apple store and see the guys at the Genius Bar. They're apparently able to work out any problem you might be having. The Support tab in the Settings menu of the Pixel is cool and all, but it doesn't compare to going out and troubleshooting the problems with real people. Just saying. Kevin Turabian The support tab on the Pixel let's the remote support team take over your device while chatting with them. It's instant and the support team can get all the information they need quickly. Going to a store is nice and walking out with a new phone is obviously nice, but overnight shipping for a new device or solving a problem without leaving the house is pretty awesome as well. Knowledgeborn Allah I agree that it's a decent system. Again, I have the Pixel XL, and I like the phone. Is it the "best overall phone of 2016"? Not even close! But yes, it's a very good phone, just like my Nexus 6P was a very good phone, and so was my Nexus 6 before that, etc. I'm not bashing the phone. I'm just saying that people need to take off these rose-colored glasses and realize that the Pixel phones weren't everything everybody wanted them to be. They fell short in a lot of areas, and more issues keep popping up nearly every week. Michael Hannigan Yeah, works perfectly... Except that it's an iPhone. Paladin Yeah, every time an iPhone user points out that we aren't having any problems with the iPhone 7/7Plus nor with iOS 10, all it does it piss off the android fanboys, especially the ones that paid too much for Pixel (the price of an iPhone with more problems than just about any previous android device. ) they don't want to hear it, but they are the ones that are stuck with that poor excuse of a phone. No stereo speaker and no waterproofing? Really? And it's the same price as an iPhone? Really? duhhhhh Doms is life360 the culprit then? Getting my XL tomorrow Johnny James I had the problem without life360. Ajax Dono Make that 101 users. I have had the issue since the upgrade to 7.1.1. it was happening 2 to 3 times per day until I uninstalled fleksy keyboard.i also have life 360 but dont want to uninstall. Crashing once per week now. I can deal with that I guess. Price we pay for a new model with newest OS. Oh and support told me I should uninstall all 3rd party apps lol. Knowledgeborn Allah Uninstall all 3rd party apps? WTF? 😂 Marcelove "Google's trying to market the new Pixel and Pixel XL phones as premium, market-leading devices, and a big part of that is nailing the software experience. " Nope, just the price is from a premium device... Everything else premium is just the illusion of owners that will ignore any problem to justify the abusive price for such hardware+software... No one that spent $800 will accept the reality that this price isn't acceptable for such device and unconsciously will close the eyes for obvious problems... And worse: many readers here at AP were Nexus owners and still bought the Dead Pixel... Google gave the middle finger to them and still they gave money to Google... So I think I'm wrong at my first sentence: besides the premium price, the only other thing from a premium device (iPhone) is the field of reality distortion that Google is using, like Apple, at its customers. thomasguide2 I don't understand why any Nexus fan would buy a Pixel. It's slap in the face with the iphone clone design and iphone pricing with software updates and cloud photo storage as it's main selling points. I don't get it. PixelXLellence ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ They're brilliant phones - best on the planet. If you actually get to experience one, you'll know. thomasguide2 For that price I'd rather get a GS7. PixelXLellence ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ Sammy's are fine hardware, but no compromises on the XL. Mine's worth every penny and brings me happiness every time I interact with it. thomasguide2 Sounds like your blow doll. PixelXLellence ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ Projecting again? Lars Jeppesen Waterproofness and slim bezels are things I cannot live without in a phone.. Unfortunately PixelXLellence ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ Agreed. If they're deal-breakers, then Sammy is the one. If a seamless, beautiful phone experience that makes my life easier and more relaxing, then you have to go XL. WestSiide I feel the same way about my cock. And just so theres no confusion, when i say cock, i am in fact referring to my penis. PixelXLellence ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ Erm... I think you opened the wrong app by mistake, ace. This is what you were looking for ;) http://www.glreview.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/grindr.jpg AsterMK I've experienced using a Pixel. It's a mediocre flagship. Your username tells me you might be just a lil' bit biased towards it though. Just a bit. Knowledgeborn Allah In all fairness, its main selling points were the Google Assistant and "best camera on a smartphone"... I bought the Pixel XL just because I was used to getting the newest Nexus device every year. And, for the most part, the phone feels like another Nexus device. It's a decent software experience, and the camera is good (I personally think there are a couple other phones with better overall cameras, but that's just me). But, in my opinion, it's definitely overpriced. They should probably be at least $100 cheaper for what you're getting. Kevin Turabian Seriously? It's what a lot of us Nexus die hards wanted from Google all along. It looks a little like the iPhone, but the in hand feel is totally different and nobody would mistake one for the other. I'm amazed at how much hate there is on this site for the Pixel, the amount of negative comments on every article pointing out an issue that affects a tiny number of devices. I wonder if imore has this many hateful comments about the iPhone 7+ camera failing. MattPortland Nope. Navin Govindani Couldn't agree more, had been waiting for something like that from Google ever since I got my N4 thomasguide2 It's over priced, Nexus = affordable, Pixel = expensive. It may have a better camera and a new launcher but is that worth $400 over a one plus 3? Amit_N Pixel is the phone on which everything can be *fixed* by a software update Berkay Not the huge bezels, lack of waterproofing, and lack of stereo speakers... navjack I count two speakers on the pixel. I put an otter case on mine so I'd have more bezel. Berkay LOL no, that thing only has one speaker. My Dixie Wrecked Yep! I just encountered this scary guy yesterday for the first time. Thought my phone was toast. Brian Duncan Wonder if it has anything to do with the new EU GPS constellation, Galileo? XerBlade I had this problem (and never could seem to find the time to Google and/or contact support about it), but I haven't had it happen since I uninstalled updates for the Google app then reupdated (in order to get off the beta channel) just under a week ago. It could just be dormant though. ¯_(ツ)_/¯ P.S. This is my first time even hearing of Life360. jawsnnn My pixels assistant app froze and wouldn't listen. Contacted Google support. They recommended clearing cache (which I had already tried). Then it cave back to the tried and tested reboot phone... which for some reason worked. Jason Madura More and more problems with pixel and xl..... Sooooooo glad I ended up going with the V20!! Funny.... Google makes Android and puts out the next iterations of it.... can't put out a phone that doesn't have bugs and problems.... Other OEM's take these versions and make them glide like waxed steel on ice... Sans Samsung. Hahaha Android has been leaps and bounds ahead of iphones for years.... first time Google heads their own phone.... they make one that is so simple and iphone-esque.... they set themselves back while other OEM's made their own software even better. Google.... Do you even know how to Google? thomasguide2 If they only made their own hardware oh wait... they sold that for a 9 billion dollar loss. Great move! It's odd that the HTC 10 doesn't seem to have these problems. Jason Madura Thanks for furthering my point mate! Google used to be top notch.... Seems like the last few years they have been hitting the decline in all things.... I think the Goog has peaked and is on the downward slope. Can't wait to see what the next "Google" is though and what they bring to the table! Lol thomasguide2 This company makes some bizarre decisions, they had motorola and chose to contract out Nexus devices to other oems. Huh? If they still owned Moto they could control the software and the hardware. Instead they have to rely on HTC or Huawaie. It doesn't make any sense. MJ Ummmm I have owned the unlocked HTC 10 (which I liked) and now a Pixel XL. Sorry, my Pixel is faster/smoother and has virtually zero lag which was NOT the case with my HTC 10 (not bad or anything). The only hardware problem I had between the two was the HTC 10 had the weakest NFC ever on a phone. Knowledgeborn Allah Android has NEVER been leaps and bounds ahead of iPhones. And I'm speaking from the perspective of somebody who loves Android (to the extent of being almost fanboy-ish). Yeah, you'll almost always have more features and better customization on Android phones. But, when it comes to speed, fluidity, and consistency, iOS has always been far ahead of Android. Their software has always been more optimized, their OEM support has always been more reliable, and their apps have always been more polished. Those are just facts. Google used the Pixel variants to try to mimic the iPhone experience because they already know that. tim242 All of that is bullshit. You should visit Apple sites for the constant issues that plague iOS. Apple releases so many .0x versions trying to fix issues, and constantly causing more. The grass isn't greener. Knowledgeborn Allah Have you seen the Android experience? Google does the exact same thing, they're just labeled differently... Why do you think they have "security patches" every month? Instead of .0x version updates, they just have monthly labels of security patch levels. tim242 Google does not release anywhere near as many updates. Security patches are just that...security patches. My S7 has not received an update that has broken anything. Security patches certainly don't cause issues. Apple still can't get BT working properly...after all these years. Knowledgeborn Allah Tell that to my Pixel XL, which constantly disconnects and reconnects to my car's Bluetooth every few minutes ever since the December security patch... Google releases an update every single month. Apple updates their devices pretty frequently, but more than once a month? Not even close. If you install the beta versions, then yes, you may get updates nearly every week sometimes. But when it comes to general public releases? They're probably about once a month, just like Google, if that often. Sir_Brizz iOS used to be ahead in speed, fluidity, and consistency a few years ago. Ever since Jobs died they have consistently delivered a worse experience to the point today where I would say they are typically pretty equal to and sometimes worse than Android. Knowledgeborn Allah Maybe when it comes to certain things... But let's be honest here. Objectively speaking, LAST year's iPhone 6s is faster than all of the Android phones of 2016. That's just reality. iOS 10 is more fluid and consistent than Nougat, which is the newest version of Android, which, by the way, almost nobody even has except Pixel and Nexus owners. Those are facts. I'm far from being an Apple fanboy, but I have to acknowledge the facts in this matter. I'm not saying that iOS is "better" than Android, but I do think it's more consistent and fluid, and their devices are definitely faster. Sir_Brizz No, it's really not. I agree that the raw performance of the device is objectively better. But in practice... It's not. The 6S+ on iOS10 has noticeable UI lag and the transition animations are extremely slow. Apps take a very long time to come up. Part of this is just design decisions that Apple has made and that's fine. They are good devices. But they are nowhere near as fluid as they used to be. It's very noticeable. Personally I find Android since Marshmallow to be a much nicer and smoother experience. That doesn't mean the raw processing power is better. Android simply isn't as aggressive at neutering things as iOS is. Knowledgeborn Allah I can't contest that. I've never owned a 6s Plus, so I don't know. I do have the 7 Plus, though, and I can honestly say that it's better than any Android phone I've ever owned, including the Pixel XL. I like the Android experience, but, ever since the Nexus 6P, I haven't even done as much as unlock my bootloader. The customization factor doesn't hold me over anymore. I am tied into Google's ecosystem pretty heavily, but I have pretty much all the Google apps on iOS, and they seem to run better on iOS than they do on Android. It's almost like having the best of both worlds. Sir_Brizz My wife has a 7+. When it gets iOS 11 it will have noticeable UI lag. It has happened to each of the last two generations of devices. They are just too aggressive at power saving. I haven't done custom ROMs since I bought my N5, but there are still many things I prefer on Android over iOS. The primary thing is notifications. Android notifications are in a whole other universe compared to the garbage that is iPhone notifications. I could name lots of other things but they one by itself keeps me on Android. PixelXLellence ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ LAST year's iPhone 6s is faster than all of the Android phones of 2016. LMAO Not by a long shot, chief. Again, my wife had the 6s+ and it was AWFUL and laggy. She traded to the iP7+ and it is a punitive, strange otherworldly nighmare in several ways, but faster than the 6s. Neither come close to the IRL performance and UX of the Pixel XL. tim242 Sans Samsung? Bahaha says the person using a SHITTY LG. GO HOME. Falcon Im on the s7 beta 4. Not a single reboot since the first beta. So much for the most optimized phone ! PixelXLellence ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ The best phone ever made. The XL is just stunning in ever way (and knocks iP7+'s dick in the dirt) escept bottom-fire speakers. But they are pretty loud nonetheless. Knowledgeborn Allah You really want to compare the Pixel to the iPhone 7 Plus after an article like this? Seriously? Lol! 🤦🏾‍♂️ PixelXLellence ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ I compare them every day. My wife got her iP7+ two days after I got my XL and the Pixel is vastly superior in every facet excpet for teh botom speaker. Knowledgeborn Allah OK, it's clear that you're being a troll. Lol! Have a good day, man... 😂 BROKEN iPhone 7+ is much better then the PixSuck PixelXLellence ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ krApple eye-fone good fone! Me wike cool silhouette dance 'mercials! Knowledgeborn Allah 🤦🏾‍♂️ You're part of a dying breed, bud. I don't know if anybody told you, but blind fanboys and blanket "brand haters" are way out of style. You should probably keep up with the times. PixelXLellence ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ lol! PixelXLellence ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ I do what makes me happy. Could not care less what's in "style" or what other people do. I'm a black wolf-dog, not a sheep. Lawrence The iPhone 7 is faster at loading anything and keeping apps opened. tim242 The iPhone 7 Plus has its own issues. Knowledgeborn Allah Very true... But I'm talking about NEW issues. The iPhone doesn't have new issues like this popping up every week. From camera lens flare, to problems with Google Assistant, to random reboots, to speaker issues, to this. 😳 How long has the phone been out? New issues shouldn't be popping up this frequently. Navin Govindani These issues are just being faced by a small number of users, very unfair to make a comparison based on them keeping in mind that iOS 10, even on the latest bunch of iPhones has a whole variety of stupid bugs like not being able to answer a call because of the unresponsiveness or having issues in the dialer and these are widespread, I can assure you that because a lot of people in my family have the new iPhones Brad Andrews The issues are incredibly minor too. When I first saw the whole issues blowing up earlier this week about the speakers I thought oh wow this must be a major problem. Then after reading realised that it just sounds like the speakers are being allowed to be slightly overdriven for their capabilities and knocking 1-2 bars off the volume depending on the video fixes it. Then I was just like, really? This has been blown way out of proportion. Sounds like if Google had just limited the max volume to slightly less the 'issue' would never have appeared in the first place. MicroNix Don't forget bluetooth. Nickname303 And so do you Dim Tim tiger Was that a joke? abc Nah, just typical fanboy stupidity. You don't really expect someone who loves a phone so much that he would name his avatar after it to be objective, do you? Marco and except bluetooth issues (with both car and stuttering audio on headphones), camera lens flare, signal dropping, issues with the speaker... I'm just collecting random bugs and defects I've read on the internet. Certainly not worth 900$+. Long live OnePlus. iPhone 7 Plus has it's own defects, most of them software because iOS is fr from perfect, but I've encountered only glitches here and there. PixelXLellence ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ I've never had any of those issues. Zsolt V Surprise. Maybe you are lying? PixelXLellence ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ lol. No, my XL continues to be a sheer joy to own since October 20th. Scott Harris Had it happen several times a couple weeks ago on my 6P. Hadn't received an OS update in a while on the Android Beta program but I unenrolled and set the device up as new and haven't had problems since then. PixelXLellence ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ I got mine October 22nd and it's been impeccable every second of every day. RenatoFontesTapia Google can't make anything right =( Nexus 5x lag, Nexus 6p turning off before the battery runs out, and now this u_u raazman So then put Apple and Samsung in that same group. drcaveman My wife's iPhone dies at 30% my note 7 was returned for fear of spontaneous detination all phones have problems it's how the manufacturer deals with the issue that makes the difference in this case, Samsung immediately issued a recall, Apple told my wife the recall for iPhones only applied to the S+ model, and it appears Google's been on the quick to mend many issues, although I don't think they ever fully got the 5X perfect they did try though. Google is working on a fix for the 6P as it's likely software related TheByteSmasher Nexus 6P also freezing on 7.1.1... Often on chrome ☹️ MJ Life360's family locator? I had to look that one up... How creepy! An app to GPS the entire family. Yes, just uninstall... Orlando aka Pixel XL Some Pixel owners do nothing but try to find problems, I never had one thing wrong with my phone since day one. I feel like people just keep trying to dog out the phone because of how much it cost and salty Nexus owners. I've been Nexus since Samsung Nexus, either move on with Pixel or go buy OnePlus 3t... tim242 It's so easy to just randomly find speaker issues, connection problems, and freezes. Some people LIKE YOU just want to live in denial. PixelXLellence ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ No denial needed if they don't exist. I have had zero issues that you mention or otherwise. Mine has been flawless literally 24/7 since Oct. 22nd. It's the best phone on the planet, pound-forpound. Knowledgeborn Allah It's funny how you say it's the "best phone on the planet"... Have you owned every single phone on the planet in order to compare it with all of them? Just wondering, because that's a pretty bold statement. PixelXLellence ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ I've owned the best flagships from LG, Sammy, Moto and Huawei - they all have nice features here and there, but are crap UX or crap something else. My wife owns the iP7+ and it's a nightmare. So, no, don't need to own every phone onthe planet to make that declaration, but I know which ones are premium and they all blow chunks compared to my XL. Sir_Brizz The iPhone of Android. No compromise device. Knowledgeborn Allah Not quite... Nathan J Well, it compromised by leaving off the memory card slot. It compromised by leaving off the IR blaster. They definitely compromised by using HTC after the HTC 10 bootloop fiasco. Calling the Pixel the iPhone of Android isn't giving the iPhone enough credit. Though I don't come to AP looking for iPhone to get the credit it's due. Quite the opposite. But I've seen three Android users/iPhone haters go to iPhone in the last year (myself first among them) and be quite happy. Some people find an OEM and stick with them. I want to try them all. Apple is different but the different perspective is refreshing. Android the OS is better, sure, but iOS isn't that bad if you just want to do basic smartphone stuff. Facebook, Spotify, Subway Surfers... any phone's gonna be good enough. You wanna test for Cyanogen or one of the other custom firmware teams? Yeah you're gonna need Android... for the rest of us, it doesn't matter. Sir_Brizz /s? Nathan J No. I don't think you understand what a compromise is. The best of Android should have those things. Otherwise it's just a compromise. Sir_Brizz I meant my post. :p maverick7526 Nexus phones haven't had a SD card in a long time, and I don't believe they had an IR blaster ever. If your want those things get a Samsung. Google have given up on SD cards as they are slower and usually cause more issues with the phone. Nathan J Still compromises. For the record, only the first one (Nexus One) had an SD card. You're right about both reasons they don't have them. Still consumer hostile. And the LG G5, I believe has the IR blaster, not the S7. Has Samsung ever had an IR blaster? I don't think they have. HTC had them before the 10. This year they passed on them and LG picked it up. Really cool feature. But not really essential. Jen Interesting. I had installed Life360 a long while ago (Nexus 5X? 2013 Moto X?), but even at that time, it was just WAY too resource intensive and my phone was much happier after uninstalling. I wouldn't be surprised if there's something *very* poorly designed about that particular app that wreaks havoc. And, perhaps the folks who don't have Life360 installed are using a similarly poorly designed app instead? IVBela *Yawns* What was the price again? I heard somebody talking about premium quality and shit. *crickets* YaKillaCJ Lol I passed on the Pixel because their isn't anything "premium" about it. It takes more than metal and glass. Bring something new to the table, raise the bar and warrant the $800+. Instead it doesn't even match the competition, yet want praise for "doing the basics right". Yet it fairs the same as a Nexus. I want the Pixel to succeed because it can set the record straight about what "Real Android" is and not OEMs bloated, laggy, unupdated crap forced on the general public. But I personally wouldn't use the Pixel even if it was a gift without any strings attached. Ok mini rant over. Michael Hannigan Totally premium. Michael Hannigan Yes you would. YaKillaCJ No I wouldn't. The only redeeming quality is stock Android comes pre-installed. I can do that myself as every device I have is rooted and the bootloader unlocked. All my devices run just as fast in real time because they run custom optimized software. No physical nav buttons is a huge downside for me. Not even the benefit of front facing speakers as compensation. Another issue is as if right now, no Xposed which is a must for me. If I had this phone, it would literally sit in the drawer. I still use my LG-G3 because although it lacks physical nav buttons, it has an IR Blaster and Wireless charging and perfect as a remote to control everything connected (or non-connected) in my home. Michael Hannigan Yes you would. Michael Hannigan Xposed sucks. Buggiest piece of garbage out there. Cat Astrophy >No physical nav buttons is a huge downside for me. Then you don't know what phone quality is because buttons break down. A screen won't and software can be easily fixed. YaKillaCJ Seriously this your logic. Why use air inflated rubber tires because the thread and rubber wear down. That said, I have never seen broken Navigation Buttons on a device outside an iPhone or Android with a broken screen in which they lost the button. Even still if I break or want to just disable the buttons, I can use On Screen Buttons. It has nothing to do with premium, if anything, its the opposite. Which is why several OEMs give the option to switch between Onscreen or Physical plus their order. Nee Austin Honestly it's surprised me by being way better than expected. I once thought as you, but have been proven wrong. The phone is actually delightful overall. (Except for the speaker location which is certifiably idiotic. I'd fire the Google manager who signed off on that.) YaKillaCJ U may not get what I mean tho. Sure it works, that's it's point in keeping it simple. Everything out has works the way it's meant to by not trying to do too much. That however doesn't warrant a $800+ price. Standing out and innovation does. That said right now I already have the "just works" experience. My phone been off the charger from 6am - 6pm and @ 75% with 3 hours SOT. 35min call, 2 hours of music (via Bluetooth and with Viper4Android), always connected to my Moto360 (1st Gen) and up time of 73 hours. The only reason I rebooted is too update an Xposed Module because I can count on my hand how many "force closed" I've had. navjack You want it to succeed but you won't buy it? YaKillaCJ For me, its lacking in several ways. However for others, it's likely the best option. Much how Android is way ahead and better than iOS. It's just that iOS devices can be a better option for some. JohnyNoLegs Do I want the best Android phone right now, if yes get the pixel. If I am poor and don't want the best, get anything else. Seriously it's not that hard to understand. No phone had everything. breon The Pixel starts at $649, which is the same price as an unlocked iPhone 7 and $50 cheaper than a Galaxy S7. YaKillaCJ The version worth getting starts at $869 (+$99 for 2 year protection). No SDcard means the 128GB is required. ggggg I also heard people talking about a premium quality phone called Galaxy Note7. It cost over $800. And finally there were… some problems. Dennis Ulijn ... and people got their money back. I dislike Samsung and you might think about them the way you do, but they solved it the best way possible. Brad Andrews Yeah, Beacause it was a hazard to people's lives. If it was a buggy app on the phone that caused it to lag sometimes, then there wouldn't have been a response from Samsung. It's only because they knew they could be up for millions and millions of dollars worth of lawsuits. MicroNix Minutes of freezing isn't lag, that's a problem. A rather big problem. Let's not sugar coat this as "lag". ggggg Not false… Michael Hannigan Yeah. Every company that gets a complaint about a product should immediately withdraw that product from the market and take a billion dollar loss. One size fits all solution. You solved it. 2kool4skool Nah, Note 7 costs 0$ cause people got their money back. This ugly-overhyped-problem-infested so called pixel on the other hand... Michael Hannigan They haven't had a chance to give everyone's money back. Maybe they will. Who knows? Michael Hannigan Best phone ever made so far. abc Why bother commenting? Google fanboys are very predictable. abc Don't you dare complain that a phone that is supposedly worth the premium price because of its "great software" has multiple issues with its software. Also, other phones have issues. So don't pick on our chosen one. Sincerely, Google fanboys FuckenJoe Not experiencing this. I don't have life 360 installed though. Nathan J Been telling you guys about HTC for a few months now... hate to say I told you so but.... told you so. PixelXLellence ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ This is about Google, not HTC. HTC was the ODM on this device, that's it. And they did a superb job at that. Ted Tabaka I literally just had this happen 20 minutes ago when I was trying to post a video on Facebook! shamatuu figure it out Google. Jordan L My Pixel XL has been pretty damned great! I did have a strange about 5 second freeze today. First time. Looking for 7.1.2 jhnsmth Life360 never installed, haven't had any issues yet on my Pixel XL Phil Kulak Yeah, getting it on my phone too. I'm not removing Life360 though. vladashram A nasty issue on the Pixel and Pixel XL lately is broken dual system images. The myriad of issues causes with the version of Android running randomly changing with reboots for some people is terrible. Check out out here on the official Google Product Forums. https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!topic/phone-by-google/DtvS_XxvBh8;context-place=forum/phone-by-google From what I pieced together, this affects both phones from the Google Play Store and Verizon, but the issue only appeared to people who were on either Verizon in the US or Rogers in Canada(So Far anyway) when they received the OTA which triggers the issue. ItsRamiL This probably has nothing to do with the article but I feel like I need to say it so here goes. I've always liked Nexus and I've always liked the pure Android experience, so naturally i like the Pixel line. Whenever I bough Nexus devices, I've always thought of them as cheap developer devices, so I kinda expected *small* problems here and there. Lately, though, I feel myself moving away from Google's offerings. I have a Nexus 5X and I've already had it replaced multiple times because of the bootloop problem (here's to hoping this one doesn't.) Google support is quick to replace it and I like that, but I bought a phone to use it, not send it in "every month" for it to be replaced. I thought if this one bootloops and I do end up getting the refund many people report they are giving out now, i'd buy a 6P, but lately all these problems with the battery are swaying me against that. So, naturally, I thought of the Pixel. A premium price, so must be a premium phone. No more issues like Nexus devices. Now all I see is camera problems, *terrible* speaker problems, and now random freezes by certain apps. It's hard for me to see myself buying one, even though i'd really like to. Google really needs to step up their game in hardware if they want to keep customers, or stay with what they do best, search and software. Now here's the part where the comments might start flooding in. This year is the first year I have ever even considered an iPhone. Sure, they have problems too, but never usually as wide spread as these, and most of the time, Apple fixes these problems. But, Apple delivered a compelling phone this year, the only iPhone in a long time that captured my eye (Only looking at the 7Plus). If i were to get another phone, unfortunately the iPhone would be on my list of choices. (That's all I'm saying about the iPhone matter, if you wanna ask anything else i'd be happy to answer.) Sure you could say "oh there's plenty of Android phones out there just pick one be together not the same yadayada.apk." But for me it's almost a 'Google or bust' kinda deal. There's just something about that stockish experience. "Broski just use a custom rom." I don't have time for those, I wish I did, but not anymore. I want a phone that works, that has the least worries, and has a stock experience. Galaxy's; never liked them except the SPens on the Notes (And the Note7 is dead so...) LG; I don't even know about them anymore. Motorola; A lost cause now. HTC; they died and I never liked their phones anyways. ASUS; lol. Huawei; The skins on their phones are jokes. OnePlus; They left a sour taste in my mouth once and I still can't wash it off. (Recommend me more brands please.) I'm in a divided state with Android OEM's. I love Android as an OS, never felt like I could leave it, but Google and other OEM's need to step up. No more games. They've fallen into this pit of "they'll buy it anyways so it doesn't matter" and i'd like to see the phones we used to know and love. The ones we created memories with. That's my $20. Felt like I needed to say that around other Android lovers, and what better place than the wonderful community of Android police. Hopefully I'm not the only person in the world who feels like this. If I am, well then I'm the center of the universe and OEM's need to do as I say. :) Feel free the criticize, ask questions, downvote, or ignore this comment. PixelXLellence ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ http://zxq9.com/dodcac/F13-32/tldrpowell2.jpg ItsRamiL Not really. I just didn't feel like opening a Google doc and typing and this comment box was closest so... lol My Dixie Wrecked I think you might be more at home at a cabin in the words so you can work your manifesto. Cakefish Sony maybe? ItsRamiL I've always liked their phones, but lately they've been slacking. Im eager to see what they bring to the table next year though. maverick7526 I'd have to agree. Having purchased a Nexus phone every year since the galaxy nexus I feel the same way. The pixel with all these issues, 7.1.1 basically bricking your 6P if you try to use it in the cold, this is all unacceptable. I find it hard to even consider Google as a phone manufacturer now. I would consider an iPhone. I just want a phone to work. I don't feel like putting this ROM here, swapping kernels etc. I just want a phone to work. If the pixel was priced nexus-like it wouldn't be that bad, however imagine getting this premium phone and dealing with a $900+ phone with poor camera lens alignment, speaker quality issues, and now software issues?! It's not worth the time, and most average users will dump this phone after this experience. As much as I hate Samsung and Apple I will probably get one of their phones next, or if Xiaomi decides to bring the Mi Mix to the US I'm in. It's been fun with nexii phone, however you can only beta test something for so long before you get fed up with it. Google needs better QC, and the next pixel should come out Jan 2018. Really take the time and put out a decent product, not a rushed one. ItsRamiL "you can only beta test something for so long before you get fed up with it." I like that but let me add something more. For me, another reason i liked Nexus is because i also loved beta testing Android and seeing new things. Android has matured greatly over the years and now if feels refined. Android, itself, just kinda works now. Today, though, i feel like the tables have turned. Instead of beta testing software (which broken things can be fixed with simple keystrokes,) it feels like we are beta testing the hardware (something that can't be fixed as easily.) Emil I replaced Nexus 5x with iPhone 7 three months ago. It's not acceptable to buy Pixel Phone with It's issues for the price you could buy iPhone which just works. That's makes me angry and I decide to leave Android and stick with iOS. The migration is not so bad after one week you will feel like you have iPhone for years. Don't panic about missing "Back" button It's not the problem. mattcoz Yeah, I've had some weird freezes every once in a while. If I try to press the recents button when ut is frozen, it will try to split into multi window mode. Adam Mitchell Interesting to see my screen shot used in an article. Maleko Not a good Christmas for Google... 6P shutdowns, Pixel freezes... It's the cold season :D mike shwilly Yesterday my Pixel turned off by itself and started bootlooping. Holding the power button helped. brolivar Mine freezes when watching YouTube videos. TomCos Every Nexus phone I ever owned does this Robert Andersson And people complain about EMUI. A skin that never freezes, is always snappy and is a battery champ. ggggg And is fucking ugly. Robert Andersson No, it's not. Care to comment on the outstanding battery life, the really fast processor and that it never freezes or reboots? AdamH Same with MIUI. Patrick Smithopolis How do you know it never freezes? I've never heard of EMUI being snappy or a battery champ. Robert Andersson I own a Huawei Mate 8, I know what it's like. Other users report the same. Never ever read any gate-stories about Huawei/EMUI (at least not the past 2 years). No touch disease, no bend-gate, no reboots, no nothing. Patrick Smithopolis I can make the same case. I've never experienced any software freezes so therefore the Pixel never freezes. Also, where do you complain if there are software issues for EMUI? Robert Andersson You can not make the same case. This and other similar articles (and user comments) prove the Pixel has widespread issues. EMUI has had some problems displaying notifications, but that's about it. Patrick Smithopolis This is not a widespread issue; 10s of users are complaining about it. And AP tends to focus on the Pixel issues because a large percentage of their readers have the phone and there's a forum for complaints. On the other hand EMUI is largely ignored because most of us here don't use it and there's no established place to complain about any software issue. Adam "On the other hand EMUI is largely ignored because most of us here don't use it and there's no established place to complain about any software issue." what? xda has a whole section for Huawei and Honor phones. They even did a partner ship with Honor with the Honor Hub. http://forum.xda-developers.com/honor-hub/ Anon the Honor 8, even with EMUI, performs faster than the Pixel. easily 5hrs SOT. lasts the whole day with more to spare Kwetsima Maluleke Lol ggggg Is that funny? Kwetsima Maluleke It's just ironic how these software issues happen so often with the Nexus line and now the Pixel. Almost makes you wonder what the point of these phones are. Patrick Smithopolis They're for people who want a close to stock experience, updates straight from Google and want to be the first to experience new versions of Android. Also, no phone is immune from software issues but in the case of Nexus/Pixel phones if a enough people complain about a particular issue Google will look into it. If there's a solution they will issue an update to the software. Robert Andersson The stock freeze experience.) 😉 Kwetsima Maluleke Of course no phone is without issue. You'd just expect the phones that represent stock Android not to have more software issues than LG or Samsung devices for example. givitumibeybi this made me happy. lomsha #petty lol SomeGuy112 Is there going to be a article every time "some" people have a issue with their Pixel? Bet I could find "some" people that have issues with every "premium" phone in existence on XDA and other various forums. I understand why articles about Pixel issues get much coverage though, it's a controversial phone in the Android community. Since so many "Android enthusiasts" are pissed the Pixel costs so much, mad about it's "plain" design and how it's not priced like a Nexus but yet still gets praised in reviews, lots of them want to see it fail. Making articles about every issue "some" Pixel owners have is perfect clickbait matreal for the bitter "Android enthusiasts" that want Google to return to making cheap Nexus devices, which also happen to be the main user base that visit hardcore Android websites like this. You know you're userbase well, Bravo! AsterMK Actually this site's user base has more Pixel fanboys than Pixel haters and it's not even close. VAVAMk_2 Nexus 6P user waiting happily with my phone for a much improved Pixel 2. Only gripe is 7.1.1 hurt battery on 6P. derp_cookies 7.1.1 actually fixed a lot of GPS and Bluetooth issues I was having. No noticeable battery issues either. VAVAMk_2 Battery has been worse for me on 7.1.1. abazigal Now you know how iPhone users feel. 😉 Knowledgeborn Allah Very true... 😏 abc Funny how the Pixel fanboys had no trouble with hundreds of positive Pixel articles that were published earlier. Đức Thành I partially agree: the reactions to this article are a bit overdramatic, but you know, fanboys will be fanboys and extremists who demand everything to be perfect and complain like it's the end of the world with every little problem (admittedly this particular case is a bit more than a little problem, but it's nothing like carrying an explosive Note 7 around waiting for it to blow up in people's faces) will be extremists. In my opinion Android Police is just doing their job, like they have always been doing by reporting problems like these. This is a specialized tech blog for enthusiasts, so there's no point if they don't report about things like these. I think they try their best to do their job and they do it well, but there is little they can do when it comes to the audience's reactions; so perhaps we should not place the blame on them. (This is beside the point, but maybe sometimes some of the audience are part of the problem; maybe sometimes we are part of the problem; and I think it'll benefit us all more if we could stop and reflect on ourselves first before we criticize anyone else.) navjack Oh totally. An enthusiast audience is part of the problem. Especially if said user base has only gotten top of the line phones and never lived with budget. Andrew My Nexus 6 does this regularly since 7.0 upgrade. Falcon The most optimized phone Lel ! Maff Mace Life360 were made aware of the issue and fixed it with an update a week later, don't think it's fair to finger them now when they fixed it a few weeks ago. I chatted to Google about the issue through the support built in to the Pixel, but because I bought through Carphone Warehouse (who they linked to as a place to buy from) they weren't interested in supporting me. Sir_Brizz Their support is so many circles of hell ahead of Apple and Samsung. They need to fix this if they actually want to be able to compete. Lawrence ZzzzZzz it is not freezing it is lagging. Chris Sanner I think it's software. This has been happening on my 6p since the official 7.1.1 update AtiRage The typical Nexus-like behavior. Good job Google! Mastermind Android in a nutshell. Premium price, mediocre software performance. lomsha Oh really Luxferro All of Google's products are beta, which is why they should be cheap. Bruce Wayne When are Android phones never experiencing some sort of freeze or bug? It's almost like a daily behavior at this point. Gabe Maier Please bring more attention to this , problem also affects stock Nexus (Nexus 5). It's something to do with the memory cache as clearing it offers temporary relief. I had to delete Facebook and Instagram to have a semi-functional phone. Pixel support just blames third party apps. Lawstorant Pixel was rushed and now it shows. I hope Google will step up their game because my Nexus 6 is waiting for a good successor. derp_cookies Man, has shit hit the fan for Pixel lately or what? Glad I didn't buy one... my 6P is doing fine. Nick Schiwy just sayin' http://www.androidpolice.com/2016/12/20/some-nexus-6ps-have-developed-a-battery-early-shutoff-problem-and-its-becoming-a-safety-issue/ my Pixel is doing fine too :) derp_cookies Not surprising to see at least 1 article about every phone with some problem. The 6P isn't as headline-catching as the Note 7 or Pixel though ;) makapav Yes, I'm facing these freezes as well. I thought they were app related but the last one caused a reboot. Darren Whats that google tap in the screen shot? b0b Wake me up when battery explodes. Rod I'm mildly interested in that wallpaper. Polarbehr What is the wallpaper in the main picture. Mikel Pr Life360 was causing me issues too about a month or two ago (nexus 6P tho) K77bkny It wouldn't be Google without its usual beta bullshit... krudl3rx I cannot for the life of me get my Amazon Drive to properly show all my files. Tried deleting cache and data, reinstall, etc. and still only a very few files will show, along with a bunch of empty files. *sigh* Michael Hannigan Come on. Let's be serious. We all know it's one shitty app causing the problem. MikeOxlong This makes me laugh. While I like the pixel software changes/updates, the hardware is way too bleh to warrant it's pricing structure. On top of that I have the full software experience of the pixel rubbing on my n6p without hiccups, and it actually runs ever so slightly better/smoother than the pixel XL I've compared it with. Lol google. SAM What do they say? Buttery smooth.. ? In Fla High priced junk is still junk. Jason B I'm not a fan of the Pixel. Hardware-wise, you know, the one thing you CAN'T change, it's a total disappointment like it was slapped together at the last minute (after finding out Huawei backed out, it might be somewhat true). The blue version is just shockingly ugly. I hope the next one knocks it out of the park, but considering Google's ADHD, it might end up worse than before. I expect the best from Google, and this isn't it. Ramon This has happened on my Nexus 6P yesterday. Don't have that app installed either. Have a video of it. likurges pixel owners aka google beta testers Hemang Bhavasar Google is giving worst service... They lost faith. I am having a lost of different problem like, having signal 📶 noise, 🔥 problems when signals fluctuating etc. But Google is not taking any responsibility. Shame on Google. thereasoner My Pixel has been fantastic, no complaints with the exception of my trucks audio system randomly switching over to the Pixel on its own while I'm listening to talk radio. Not sure if the trucks system or the Pixel is to blame for that. Overall I think the Pixels have been well received. The issues being reported are isolated, quite minor and fixable when compared to the problems from iPhones currently and over the years. Nee Austin I've only ran into the audio bug at full volume when I ran those very specific videos. In other words who cares? It's good someone ran across a bug and identified it, but some perspective would be helpful. I know.. Impossible when 'a user' had a lock up on a *gasp* pixel by *gasp* Google. So let's return to stories about exploits of millions of Russian phones running pirated games. el hi this will be fixed in the next update el hi Refi notice:http://treegreat.com/RLI=1-UI=1-OI=11166-II=2612120-IDE=380568-MID=1067-FID=79236 el hi one best android phones in 2016 navjack From a Moto g 1st gen on republic wireless to the pixel on fi I have to say that this phone is premium. No issues with it, I can actually multi task without apps closing in the background. I use the multi user function in the OS a ton. The CPU benchmarks quite fast and in real world it performs perfectly. Hadi Satrio With that price tag, one would expect Google to already gave up its habit of beta-testing products on the fly. 🤷 Sid I haven't faced any problems with my Pixel. Been using it since October end and its still flying. My wife loves mine over her iphone7. Definitely an happy user, will get Pixel 3 breon I hate to jump on the 'me too' bandwagon, but I've been having this issue since updating to 7.1.1. I get random freeze by getting directions with Google Maps, watching a video on YouTube, swiping between home screens. Rebooting doesn't seem to help. In fact it seems to freeze more frequently after a boot. I've reset the phone with no luck. I'm at the point now where I only have 3 non-Google apps on the phone. I'm going to start adding more over time to see if it was a rogue app. Even if it is an app misbehaving, the Android OS shouldn't allow it to hijack and freeze the entire phone, it should kill the app. Whatever happened to the ol' force close screen? HeyRadar Still glad I went with the Moto Z instead. Same hardware with no muss, no fuss, and way cheaper. dcdttu Just a friendly update: I've uninstalled Life360 for 2 weeks not and it's not locked up / rebooted once. This is on 2 different Pixels, btw. It's totally Life360 doing it to me. Mike J I purchased my Pixel because I read the reviews and wanted a phone that was reliable. I use it for work, I rely on my phone to make money. What I got was disappointment. After about 4 weeks the phone would randomly shut down, sometimes I would get calls and I couldn't hear the other person. Then one day it just became unusable. No sound during a call but I could see the call was connected. Hard reset didn't work, and I was working with a google tech support person without any luck. I had to get a replacement sent to me. Now I'm a few months into my replacement pixel and I'm still not satisfied. I never had these reliability issues with my Samsung S5. I've had this phone tell me my phone app isn't responding, I woke up one morning late because the alarm didn't go off. It was hooked to a charger like usual at night and just shut down. The power on button didn't start it and I had to use the hard reset to get it going. Lots of times it just freezes for a while. I must restart this phone about every other day to keep it running correctly. When I play back voicemail, the playback is choppy and it kind of jumps back a second or two during the message so it sounds like stuttering. Hard to explain but very annoying. I use a bluetooth earpiece because I drive and work while talking on the phone. sometimes when I make a call it will drop my bluetooth device after dialing the number and I have to pay attention and make sure i'm still connected in case I need to grab the phone and talk directly into it so I don't make the person I'm calling wonder and wait why I'm not talking to them. I only load the minimum apps I need because I'm afraid I'll load something that will interfere with the phone. I search once in a while for others that may have similar issues but I have trouble finding anything bad online about the phone. How is it such a great phone has given me so many problems and I'm on my second one???

Tech Industry by Dara Kerr May 19, 2017 3:31 PM PDT @darakerr Anthony Levandowski speaks to the press during last September's launch of Uber's self-driving cars. Angelo Merendino/Getty Images Uber appears to be distancing itself from Anthony Levandowski, its star self-driving car engineer, who's at the center of a lawsuit filed against the company by Waymo. In the suit, Waymo, the self-driving car unit of Google parent company Alphabet, accuses Levandowski of stealing 14,000 "highly confidential" files on driverless car technology. In a strongly worded letter to Levandowski, Uber's head of legal, Salle Yoo, said he needs to return any stolen files or testify under oath that he never took them. And if he doesn't agree, Uber may fire him. "If you fail to comply in a material manner," Yoo wrote in the letter, written Monday but made public late Thursday, "then Uber will take adverse employment action against you, which may include termination of your employment." Yoo emphasizes in the letter that Uber is required to take these steps to comply with a court order in the lawsuit. The legal battle pits two of Silicon Valley's most-watched companies against each other. Between the two, Uber has more to lose. Google has built a massive search business and has its hands in everything from online ad sales to Wi-Fi to social media. Uber, on the other hand, has a more limited business model. It's built a ride-hailing empire, but it's betting on self-driving cars to be the future of its company. While Waymo's suit focuses on the actions of Levandowski, the case is against Uber. Waymo alleges that Uber colluded with Levandowski to steal designs for its self-driving car tech. Levandowski used to work at Google but quit in January 2016 to form his own self-driving truck startup, called Otto. Uber bought Otto last August for $680 million and named Levandowski head of its self-driving car program. Uber has called Waymo's claims "baseless" and argues that its technology is "fundamentally different" from Waymo's. Complicating matters is the fact that Levandowski has pleaded the Fifth. The US Constitution's Fifth Amendment protects individuals against self-incrimination. This means he's been able to refuse to answer questions about the alleged file theft or turn over his personal laptop. Related stories Waymo v. Uber brawl sees 'suspicious' acts, 'pilfered files' Waymo vs. Uber lawsuit: 10 things you need to know Uber says it's not 'hiding anything' in Waymo case Uber doesn't dispute that Levandowski downloaded the 14,000 files (though it claims none of those documents entered its servers). Federal Judge William Alsup, who's presiding over the case, agrees with Waymo that something "highly suspicious" happened. Alsup issued a ruling Monday ordering Uber to return any purloined documents to Waymo by May 31. He also formerly barred Levandowski from working on Uber's lidar, which is the laser technology used in self-driving cars that Levandowski helped pioneer at Google. "While we have respected your personal liberties, it is our view that the court's order requires us to make these demands of you," Yoo wrote in her letter. "We insist that you do everything in your power to assist us in complying with the order." Neither Waymo nor a lawyer representing Levandowski immediately responded to a request for comment.

The researchers used “fancy machine learning” to eliminate human biases and come up with a scientific way to determine criminality by examining facial features, University of Washington professor Carl Bergstrom told his class in Mary Gates Hall one day last month. “What do you guys think?” Bergstrom asked. In unison, more than 100 students responded out loud: “Bulls—!” Exactly. Biology professor Bergstrom and Information School professor Jevin West are co-teaching a seminar this quarter that’s all about BS — or, precisely, “Calling BS in the Age of Big Data.” The 10-week seminar class has achieved the academic version of a chart-topping pop single: At the UW, it reached its 160-student capacity shortly after registration opened this spring. Its reach across the globe is even more impressive. Colleges in Canada, France, Portugal, England and Australia have contacted the professors about teaching a version of the course this fall. A partial list: Carnegie Mellon University, Hofstra College, Iowa State University, Stanford University, Columbia University, UCLA, Oxford University (England), Universite de Nantes (France), Murdoch University (Australia), University of Guelph (Canada) and Instituto Piaget (Portugal). Currently, a Catholic high-school teacher in Minnesota and a tech college in Copenhagen are teaching the course, and the University of Alaska Anchorage will teach it this fall. The course syllabus is freely available, as are YouTube videos of the lectures. West and Bergstrom are especially enthusiastic about helping high school teachers use the BS course materials to develop classes. “Ultimately, that’s very important to us, because this is material that shouldn’t wait until your senior year of college,” West said. The professors attracted widespread attention by using a profanity in the title of the course, but the interest is real. So far, the first video of their class lecture has been viewed more than 12,000 times. Calling BS is not a class about fake news, and it’s not a political science course. Rather, the professors want students to develop a skeptical eye about big data and its limitations, particularly in the sciences. They’re teaching how to recognize results that are just too good to be true. In their fifth lecture, Bergstrom and West explored why Google’s much-vaunted ability to predict a flu outbreak turned out to be, well, BS. They picked apart the Chinese criminality project. They examined the mystery of why — with the exception of Sept. 11 — the 11th day of the month is referenced less frequently in books and literature than almost any other day of the month, at least as measured in a Google book-scanning project.(Think you know the answer? Read to the end.) One of their main themes: If the data collected for use in an analysis isn’t solid, the result won’t be, either. “Garbage in, garbage out,” West told the class. In the case of the algorithm that claimed to predict criminality, the Chinese researchers used pictures of incarcerated and innocent people to create a mathematical formula to identify people in each category. But, as Bergstrom noted, the non-criminals were wearing faint smiles; the criminals had subtle frowns etched into their faces. “I have this hypothesis that this is a smile detector,” he told the class. As for Google Flu Trends — Google’s instantaneous map of influenza hot spots, created using the geographic locations of searches for flu-like symptoms — the company appeared to be predicting outbreaks as much as two weeks faster than the Centers for Disease Control, which relied on confirmed reports of influenza from doctors and medical centers. “When I read this article, I remember taking it to my class and saying, ‘Big data really is amazing,'” West said. “Big data is changing the world.” But Google Flu Trends soon became the poster child of big-data hubris and overreach, West said. As time ticked along, researchers realized that the tracker was overestimating flu cases most of the time, and in one case, overestimated it by more than 50 percent. “In fact, what they found is that if you just took a simple model, like tracking the temperature, it would do a better job” of predicting flu outbreaks, West said. The two professors bring a sense of humor to their lectures. “We’re making it fun — making it entertaining, theatrical, to make it less intimidating,” West said. Because the class is made up of students from 40 different majors, the material is short on technical detail and long on developing a common-sense BS detector. Next fall, Calling BS will be offered as a three-credit course at the UW, and the professors hope to include guest speakers — climatologists and doctors, for example – along with videos from experts across campus who can talk about what BS looks like in their fields. “I want to tell them meaningful stories in the class, that they’ll tell people after dinner,” Bergstrom said. “These are the conversations we want to start.” They’re also making available a sanitized version of their materials (which uses the word “bull” instead of BS) that could be used in middle or high school. And they’re hopeful that a new law Gov. Jay Inslee signed last month, which encourages schools to teach media literacy, will draw teachers to their site. As for why the 11th day of the month is so infrequently referenced in scanned texts: Google’s algorithm confused the number 11 with other look-alike characters – capital Is, lowercase ls, even the letter n — and often failed to recognize the number in the books it scanned.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Apps & Software Image Source: Eric Risberg/AP/REX/Shutterstock Android O’s most exciting new feature is a total game-changer Chris Smith @chris_writes May 19th, 2017 at 6:11 PM Share Tweet Google shared more details about its next major Android release during its opening keynote at Google I/O 2017. There are many user-facing features that Android fans will appreciate, but also several under-the-hood changes that should make Android even better in the coming years. One of them was actually unveiled a few days before Google’s developer event kicked off, and Google only mentioned it briefly during the event. But Project Treble is an amazing trick, at least in theory, that could finally fix one of Google’s most annoying Android problems. In the process, the feature might make the Google Pixel even better than it already is. Don't Miss: The best new features in Android O have nothing to do with Android O Project Treble doesn’t sound too exciting, and some Android users might not even care about it. But it’s the one thing Google should have developed years ago to fix Android fragmentation. What Google wants to do with Android going forward is to separate the underlying Android operating system from the ‘Vendor interface’ that contains all the low-level software and drivers. This code modularity would allow Google to issue Android updates much faster to more devices, not just Nexus and Pixel phones. Of all the current phones that are going to be updated to Android O after Google releases the new operating system, only the Pixel will take advantage of Project Treble. What that actually means is that Google might update the phone even after the mandatory two-year period for software updates expires. Image Source: Google The news came at Google I/O, Android Police reports, where Google’s VP of engineering for Android confirmed that current Pixel models will work with Project Treble. This also means that some of the hottest Android phones currently available in stores, including the Galaxy S8, will not get Project Treble support. The Pixel series is the only exception, which means that Google is fixing fragmentation, but the fix only applies to devices that run at least Android O or newer out of the box (other than the Pixel). That said, you shouldn’t get too excited about your Pixel getting updates well beyond the two-year mark. Just because Google can do it doesn’t mean it will. Also, it’s likely that in two years time, you’ll want to replace the Pixel with something newer since typically only savvy Android fans buy Pixels.

How Google plans to tackle power consumption even more aggressively in Android Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/05/18 5:29pm PDTMay 18, 2017 13 Plus 1 on G+ 93 Share on Facebook 55 Share on Twitter Total Shares161 Android OS Development Google News Videos Yesterday at I/O Google had an interesting talk called Background Check and Other Insights into the Android Operating System Framework. It's a long name, but really it's about improving battery life in Android. It went on at great length as to how, exactly, they plan on doing that, and it's quite worth a watch. We have the video here, but if you don't have the half-hour to check it out, then you are welcome to read below. The central methodology Google is using to try to improve things is the idea of visibility. When something is running in the background and doing a ton of stuff like calling your location at quick intervals, it results in battery drain. So now Google wants to change how things happen in the background, by ensuring that free-running background services aren't sucking your battery dry. Background apps will be pushed out of memory when they leave the foreground, and requests for things like location or WiFi happening in the background will only occasionally see new information from Android. Applications that would otherwise receive broadcasts also might not wake up unless they are given an explicit call to do so in the broadcast, although there are some exceptions. Apps can still get around this by being foregrounded in some way, but now that will be something visible that the user is aware of. This focus on visibility for apps will also mean developers will have to make decisions about what is really better to the user. If doing an ongoing notification as a means of bypassing the stuff above would confuse a user, is that really the right thing for them to do in that case? Other tools can be used to schedule your tasks ahead of time or to wait for events like the job intent service that developers can use in both pre and post-O environments. Jobs and alarms also allow the OS to defer. So, if something happens that would trigger a bunch of other apps to wake up, like a new picture being taken, that can be passed to those apps one at a time after a delay. That way the user doesn't suddenly have a ton of performance issues and drain out of nowhere. Basically, Google wants to solve some of the problems with battery life by defining bad behaviors for developers, like persistent background services or accidental leaks to the background of typically foregrounded activities, and make it clear that things have to be done the right way going forward or their stuff won't work. But it's also giving them new tools and choices for how to best accomplish the things they need to do. The new features in the Play Console and in Android Studio should also help developers be aware of when they are making these mistakes so that they can be fixed. It's a matter of visibility for the developers as well as visibility for the users. To paraphrase Steve Balmer: Visibility, visibility, visibility. A significant user-facing change of this visibility mindset is a new battery menu in O, with a focus on actionable interaction. Instead of just seeing stuff like Screen and Google Play Services next to a number that they won't understand, now users will be given ways of interacting with that data if they don't like it, and can better see how they are using applications without needing to do a bunch of mental calculations. So, when a user has a problem with their expectations of battery performance and goes looking to see what might be causing it, they are more likely to find what caused it, understand what it means, and take action about it. All of these changes are is in pursuit of Google's holy grail: multi-day battery life. Right now the tools in software aren't all there, but these are steps that can take us in that direction.

Good feature to take from iOS Knowledgeborn Allah This does seem similar to what Apple implemented in iOS, but I'm curious about how this will impact RAM management. If it reduces the cache file too much, it'll just close the application completely, and you'll have to start over every time you want to use the app again. Apple somehow found a way around this problem, even in devices with less RAM, but I'm not too sure how Google will accomplish this. Even "doze" on my Pixel XL kills apps in the background all the time. This new thing sounds it could potentially make the problem worse. Justin Osborne Well I sure can tell a difference since upgrading, that's for sure. The new battery section makes me feel a lot better about how the battery is looking. But that's where it ends. Today, I got a full hour less out of my battery than normal. 2 hours vs 3-3.5 on the Pixel. That said, it's a beta, so I'm not complaining. It's definitely not the direction I want to go tho (nor are these new emoticons, sigh). marcusmarcus2 "Google's holy grail: multi-day battery life." I'm glad, but can we get a two pronged attack to address this. Yes, Google needs to keep improving the software side, but OEMs need to help out and quit making thinner phones. They are thin enough, give us more battery capacity. AbdulB1 actually they save quite a lot by putting small batteries in the phones instead of big ones. Krzysztof Jozwik I'm not sure you read OP's comment. Nothing was said about saving... AbdulB1 smaller capacity battery is much cheaper marcusmarcus2 My original comment was not about savings, cheapness, cost, etc. Jack Jennings You've said the same thing twice for no reason. Krzysztof Jozwik I wouldn't say "much" I'm no expert on the matter, but last I checked replacement batteries aren't that expensive, and I don't have the buying power of an oem AbdulB1 Most phones today dont have replacement batteries, they have unremovable ones. OEM or no OEM a 3000mAh battery will always be cheaper than 4000mAh one. marcusmarcus2 I can find batteries for my different Moto G phones that have "Non-User replaceable batteries" for nearly the same price as my LG phones that have user replaceable batteries online. Most likely the OEMs can get them for about the same as well so replaceable or not really does not matter. Either way, yes a 3000mAh battery will be cheaper than a 4000mAh one for OEMs, but probably not much at all, especially at the volume they would by at. I'm guessing they are choosing smaller batteries to make their phones thinner and not because it is slightly cheaper for them. Thinness is better to advertise to most consumers as most consumers are drawn to looks over functionality now a days. I still prefer function over looks for my devices. Krzysztof Jozwik And non replaceable will always be cheaper than replaceable. The point is, the batteries aren't the bulk of the cost. Geoff Johnson What the hell is your point? He never said anything about cost, he was just talking about stop making phones thinner for design and aesthetic reasons. james fuston The idea that smaller and thinner phones result in less battery life is a bit of a misnomer. For an example, I'd refer you to the iPhone SE. marcusmarcus2 I never said smaller and thinner. I just said thinner. They could make some of the phones the same height and width as the current one but make it a little thicker to give a thicker battery, and that would help with the battery life. james fuston Okay, but your general sentiment is still that battery life is tied directly to physical size which, again stating my example of the iPhone SE, isn't the case. The power draw of the components is far more important than the physical size of the phone. marcusmarcus2 My general sentiment is ONLY in regards to thickness of the phone. My sentiment is not to width or height, which also make up the size of the phone. The width and height is usually determined more by the screen where thickness is more often do to battery. A larger screen (component) will draw more power than a smaller screen, I agree with you there. But you seem to think the size of the battery does not make a difference, please correct me if I am wrong. Using your example of iPhone SE, if they would have made that a little thicker than it is now by making the battery larger, that would have made the battery life even longer than it already is. That is my point. james fuston > A larger screen (component) will draw more power than a smaller screen, I agree with you there. Let me give this one more shot. "your general sentiment is still that battery life is tied directly to physical size which, again stating my example of the iPhone SE, isn't the case" To break out the pieces, battery life is tied...to physical size...which, again...isn't the case. In other words, we do not agree. The iPhone SE is the exact same size as the iPhone 5S and it gets 30%+ better battery life purely through efficiency in components. To say high mAh results in long battery life is a misnomer that the G6 or V20 should be a clear reminder of. You also cannot equate physical size to battery capacity as energy density is not a universal measurement. marcusmarcus2 You are comparing different phones with different components. I agree with you that component efficiency has an effect on battery life. But... Let me give you one more shot. We will use your iPhone SE for this. If there were 2 versions of the SE. Both have the exact same components except one has a battery that is 1000 mAh larger than the other (thus making it slightly thicker), than the one with the larger battery would have more battery life, Thus the thicker one would have better battery life. That is what I am saying. I'm not comparing large phones to small phones. I'm saying if they had a larger battery in a phone with the exact same specs/components then the battery life would be better. That is all my point was. Do you not agree with that? EDIT: Yes, size of the battery may not increase with capacity due to density, but it usually will increase in size as it does increase in capacity, especially if it increases a lot. Geoff Johnson Again, you're talking about it being smaller. The iPhone SE gets good battery life because it has a 4" screen. The complaint is that phones are getting THINNER. Meaning that they still have 5.5-6" displays, but are thinner and translate to smaller batteries. james fuston Nope, not at all. The cell in the SE is about 50mAh bigger than the 5S (which is the exact same size). The 30%+ battery life improvement comes from more efficient components, not just their size. marcusmarcus2 Technically it is 2 dimensional train of thought. Also, if they increased it horizontally or vertically, then they would most likely have to increase the dimensions of the phone horizontally or vertically, thus changing the size of the screen or bezel. Increasing it thickness wise means they would not have to change the look of the of the front of the phone. Anywho, I'm only talking about thickness, not height, width, different components, different phones, not small phones or big phones. I'm talking just battery capacity, if all other components remain the same. Thickening the battery would add battery capacity without changing the over all look much at all. It could be any phone of your choosing. If adding a thicker/higher capacity battery to whatever 1 phone you want, that phone would have a longer battery life. Do you not agree with that logic? JD The SE wasn't thinner. Ryne Hager Give me a OnePlus with 5000mAh and I would be so happy. someone755 Give me a 4.7" phone like the og Moto X and I would be so happy. Neither of us are going to be happy, Ryne. Drakenoid OG Moto X updated for current year would be perfect for me. Kristian Ivanov I highly agree on the thin phones part. Bought a Huawei P10 2 days ago, for me, that thing is unusable without a case to make it a bit fatter. Karly Johnston If they fix idle battery drain that doesn't become an issue. marcusmarcus2 I'm not saying they should not fix battery drain. I'm saying if they fix battery drain AND add higher capacity battery (making phone a little thicker), they could increase battery life even more than just addressing one of them. So if fixing the battery drain adds another day and a thicker battery adds another day, you'd go from 1 day to 3 days instead of just 2 days from only fixing battery drain. Karly Johnston The battery life the current 625 phones are getting is where flagships need to be. That should be enough for anyone. marcusmarcus2 Everyone is not all the same. It may be enough for you. I'm saying, phones are beyond thin enough and could be thicker to increase battery life even more beyond what a 625 phone can do. Now, this is my opinion in regards to how I would like to use a phone. You are welcome to your own opinion. I'm not going to say what should be enough for anyone other than me. Karly Johnston The OEMs don't think that is what the vast majority of people need or want. Their target is a full day of battery life which is what most people are worried about. It isn't my opinion, it is the industry opinion of what the marketing priorities are. X-47B My phone has 4000 mAh battery, and it's 5.5-inch display. I easily get 2 days of battery even after heavy usage. Margaritas Ante Porcos Installed O on my 6p and battery still drains like a whore in a bukkake twelvesome. Google really can't do nothing at this point. Android is breaking to pieces. So many things needed to be fixed in O but instead Android's got even worse. That notification empty desert area of white grey nothingness kills me the most. Hate it really bad. The last Android I liked was 6th. catalysto Not sure what you're talking about. Battery life on my 6P with the new O is great. Maybe you have an aging battery? Margaritas Ante Porcos as long as your 6p works great, nothing else matters, right? Roy That's right. catalysto Just saying. My anecdotal evidence is as good as yours. And having poor battery life across multiple OS versions is a pretty strong indicator for a bad battery, don't ya think? In fact, I had the same problem with a previous 6P. iFeign Complain some more about your beta software Margaritas Ante Porcos It started with 7.1.2. Do you really need to be a btch when bad things happen to others? Roy For me everything goes smooth on my 6P on 7.1.2. so I need to complain that Android to good. The Wrath of Kahn If your 6P has shut down even once before reaching about 5% then you most likely have one of the defective batteries. I had to have mine replaced, but after that, it runs all day like a charm. ODP2 improved it, if anything. Margaritas Ante Porcos it was fine for a long time until I updated to 7.1.2. That update screwed the battery that was working superb all the time. DANA Try to do a factory reset, it fixes many problem for some user. Margaritas Ante Porcos It was one of the first things I did. Twice. Did not help. Paul_Werner Yeah you got to call Google (if you got yours from the Play Store). They've been replacing 6Ps with factory refurbished ones even out of warranty (source: it happened to me) Matthew Skalecki The update didn't screw up your battery. The battery was going to crap out on you regardless of which Android version you had. This happened to many people including me. Replacing the battery fixes the issue; reverting to a previous os does nothing. Zach Mauch Did you go through Google or a local shop? The Wrath of Kahn Unfortunately it was out of warranty, had a friend with the skills do it for me. JD I need more of this colorful imagery to describe simple everyday problems. mchalakov First off you are using a beta OS don't complain. Second thing is that battery drain comes mostly from the (bad)apps - if you watched the video or read the article you could understand. Third - I'm pretty sure you can go back to Marshmallow if you are so so so unhappy with Nougat or O. Jakst Really? Yesterday was my first day with Android O. I plugged my phone out at 7, and come home at midnight with 35 % battery left. I've never had that kind of battery life in my 6P before. So I've seen huge gains with this O preview. thereasoner The Android O beta I'm using is so slow to charge my Pixel today that it seems like that's what they tackled​....and not in a good way. iFeign Surprise, surprise, you're running BETA software. Smh. thereasoner Yeah I know and I'm sure it will get fixed between now and September. I'm just saying that the current difference in charge time is quite noticable at this point. AbdulB1 maybe they removed quick charge support in beta mattcoz Pixel never had quick charge. AbdulB1 hmm interesting. I thought it has qualcomm processor so it must have qc 3.0 too. Must be some proprietary stuff or qualcomm must be asking for more money to enable it. mattcoz Google is pushing the open USB-C power delivery standard. AbdulB1 Display screen eats up most of my battery. I can't see what google is doing will fix it somehow. We need different types of screens now. iFeign Uhh, it's as if you expect things to use NO battery at all. Infinite battery life! Of course using the screen, aka, using the phone, is going to be the largest proportionate power drain - no matter how fancy the screen tech. AbdulB1 battery tech has still not improved and nor did the screen tech. I can accept that the screen tech will remain same for a long time but as far as batteries are concerned they can be improved , made for longer number of recharge cycles but that hasn't caught up with the manufacturers yet. One thing which can be done is increasing the battery capacity but we all know this is not happening as phone manufactures think it will make phones bulky , add weight and in long term affect the sale of newer devices. Latheryin Multi day battery life will not happen until new battery tech comes around. With people needlessly having screen on times of 5+ hours there is no way to keep a battery charged for extended periods. Krzysztof Jozwik I average 2 hours of screen on time a day. Just because some use their phone 24/7 doesn't mean we all do. I have a job where I'm not on my phone, at home I have better screens to get info from. The phone is there when I need it. Your nonstop use case is not the norm. Latheryin As do I but that is not the norm. Might want to look at any forum about battery life and looking at screen on times. Most want and use 5+ hours. It's mainly the older generation like us that doesn't need it and are not on the device all the time. Krzysztof Jozwik Obviously the forums about battery life have people winning that they want 48 hours of screen on. That is not the norm. Sure, lots of people want that, most do not. Latheryin Most want more screen on time. Why do you think battery life is such an issue. disqusdeeznuts My Moto Z Play begs to differ. Motorola does it right with this phone. It has a good size battery (3510), an efficient processor, and runs smooth. It can be done, but for some reason, it just isn't a focus for a majority of manufacturers. Latheryin Well sure all the devices with that mid range chip and battery combo can get ok battery life. I could easily. Get 2 days out of my device and it only has a 3200 battery. It is not the oem. It's people. They need to spend less time look at their phone and more time living life. Which many are unprepared for. Cakefish I'm going the leaked Moto X4 continues that legacy onwards! Rod Ever heard of the Moto z Play, or Lenovo P2? Latheryin As already stated on that. The moto has a mid tear chip. As for the Lenovo, nope. Can't say I have, it's either not sold in my country or a mid low tier device that I wouldn't have noticed. Just looked. They both use the same mid tier chip. Also that does have a good battery. But that like the K1000 with a 10000 battery are the exception and seldom are they flagship quality. WarpspeedScp The Moto z does not have an SD 820 on it. Neither does the P2. It's very annoying that manufacturers can't give us something functional instead of eye-candy for once. Rod While it's not top of line sillicon, real world testes have proven that, for everyday tasks, there's virtually no difference between the S625 ans 821 WarpspeedScp Well, my phone has an SD 650, and dolphin emulator just about keeps up (wind waker and super smash Bros). On an 820, there would definitely be better results. Paul Troy I have a better idea. Get the hardware manufacturers to put a bigger battery in their devices. 💡 Taedirk If we could convince hardware manufacturers to do something useful, we wouldn't be on yet another revision to how Android updates the OS. Alex Yeah so this way the horrible wakelocks (that Android makes almost impossible to manage) will be less visible. Cakefish Why not both? Zach Mauch All I want to know is can they stop wakelocks. JD Same bullshit every year. I'll believe it when I see it. Unless Android O somehow allows me to download more mAh. Morten Ulv Are you trying to say Android battery life hasn't improved VASTLY over the years? JD Yep in fact it's regressed Morten Ulv I have no such issues. Better battery all across the board. JD What ever you're smoking pass that shit around Morten Ulv Your shit must be stronger than mine. browngeek I miss the days of my Xperia Z3 Lollipop and Stamina mode. Used to get 48 hours and 5-6 hours SOT. D13H4RD2L1V3 I hope this actually does something when the final build is out. I'm getting tired of hearing of every new battery improvement in a new version of Android only to have a wakelock pretty much make all of that moot. Dennis Ulijn I am on the Android O beta, and i must say that the information i get from it it really useful! I never could find the wakelocks because i'm not rooted, but now i can easily see what apps use up battery in the background. Awake meditation app was in use for 15 minutes (meditation) and active in the background for 1 hour (basically, ever since the meditation)! "Restrict background usage" to on, and we'll see what it brings tomorrow. PI this is interesting .... :) ,, Whats the current update Dennis Ulijn I'm in Europe so I just woke up. I'll let you know end of the day. Sabin Bajracharya Meanwhile Google's own apps will somehow be able to bypass this restriction :D Michael Sørensen Google's own location services, Now cards, Chrome, etc. eats the most battery for me - even worse with location history on. How about fixing that first...? WarpspeedScp Try Firefox! Also, turn location off as soon as you can. mlm5em But with O, you can now turn off Background activity on an app specific basis. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/eaaaef5de863733535628a24f5b0d44f888ae3ff0cb89d1c8cffc0680083c526.png mattcoz Good to see there's an option to turn it off. Morten Ulv Very handy! IncCo Anything that improves the battery life is awesome John Monks I have concerns about this. There are some apps I *want* running in the background, but I don't want them filling up the notification shade. One example, Lightflow has to have a pointless notification in order to do the job I installed it to do. I know it's there, any consequences for my battery life are mine to live with. It would be OK if I could toggle a setting to permit a particular app to run a 'free running background service' silently but this is Google so I expect I'll have to put up with spam instead (and no, collapsed notifications are still notifications), or there will be a toggle that does nothing, like the 'ignore optimisation' setting that currently exists. Drakenoid There apparently is, check comments above, there's a screenshot. Cakefish It's about damn time. All hail Android O. AdamH So does it mean my phone will be useless? something_new Apple was right then Đức Thành I'm beginning to get excited again, even knowing that actually achieving this would take many years. Fidelator Allow us, the end user, to have absolute control over which apps can run in the background under certain conditions, I have disabled notifications on Facebook and Instagram yet they still have multiple persistent RAM hogging battery sucking services 100% of the time smeddy My next phone won't get a look-in without a 4000mah+ battery in it. Since Samsung dropped the removable battery, battery anxiety has crept back into my life.

USA TODAY Jessica Guynn , USA TODAY , KPNX 7:09 PM. MST May 19, 2017 Google CEO Sundar Pichai at Google I/O (Photo: Google) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. — Google's mission is to steer people to the information they need in their daily lives. One crucial area the Internet giant says could use some work: Jobs. So Google is launching a new initiative, Google for Jobs, that includes a feature in search that collects and organizes millions of job postings from all over the web to make them easier for job seekers to find. In coming weeks, a Google search for a cashier job in Des Moines or a software engineering gig in Boise will pop up job openings at the top of search results. With Google for Jobs, job hunters will be able to explore the listings across experience and wage levels by industry, category and location, refining these searches to find full or part-time roles or accessibility to public transportation. Google is determined to crack the code on matching available jobs with the right candidates, CEO Sundar Pichai said during his keynote address Wednesday at Google's annual I/O conference for software developers here. "The challenge of connecting job seekers to better information on job availability is like many search challenges we’ve solved in the past," he said. Pichai says he hopes Google's new job search function will surface new opportunities for job seekers who often don't know there's a job opening "right next door."

(Photo: Google) Google is the latest Silicon Valley company to announce an effort to boost American jobs after President Donald Trump's call to put America first. The aggressive push into jobs could help Google attract even more employment-related advertising. Already, it's expected to pull in three-quarters of search ad spending in the U.S. this year, according to research firm eMarketer. It's also another example of the consumer-centric company's dive into the corporate sector as it hunts for new revenue sources beyond advertising. Anytime an 800-pound gorilla like Google enters a market, it sends shudders through the established players in the targeted industry. Google's leap into travel search was a game changer for the travel booking industry. In job search, the heavyweight is Indeed, which says it's the largest job search engine, with more than 20 million job postings and 200 million unique visitors a month. "We are happy to see that 13 years after Indeed launched, Google has woken up to the fact that searching for jobs is one of the most important searches in anyone’s life,"  Indeed President Chris Hyams told USA TODAY. Other job-search companies — such as Monster and CareerBuilder — are partnering with Google, an unusual amount of cooperation from its competitors. Google scours the web, pulling from a broad cross-section of job listings, including from Glassdoor, Facebook, LinkedIn and ZipRecruiter. The aim is to "increase the efficiency of job matching," said Nick Zakrasek, a product manager for Google search, who gave USA TODAY a first look at the new search results job seekers will soon see. Job seekers who find a listing via Google search are then taken to the company or job-search site listing, where they can apply. Google for Jobs could prove useful to Americans whose economic anxiety is growing despite low unemployment rates, as more jobs are being displaced by technological advances, increased automation and spreading globalization. Google is very much a part of those advances: It's charting an artificial intelligence-powered future that promises to radically transform how people earn a living in the years ahead. "Google’s always looking at new things it can do with the skill set it has, and particularly ways it can get deeper into search and deeper into enterprises," said Jan Dawson, chief analyst with Jackdaw Research. "Jobs is a good fit for both of those, where it can provide a custom or deep search function for job listings on the consumer side and also offer businesses a system to hire workers on the enterprise side." For employers, identifying the right candidates can be daunting, with nearly half of U.S. companies saying they face challenges in filling open positions. On the employer front with Google for Jobs, Google is selling artificial intelligence and search technology to companies to make make it easier for them to find qualified recruits on their websites and job boards, Pichai says. In November, Google launched a piece of that technology — Clouds Jobs API, which employers access through Google Cloud. The pilot program with FedEx, Johnson & Johnson, Health South and CareerBuilder is being expanded to include more than 30 employers, job boards and staffing agencies, he said. "It’s still early days, but we've seen promising results," Pichai said. For example, since using the Cloud Jobs API, Johnson & Johnson has found that 18% of job seekers are more likely to apply for a job on the company's career site, he said.

Facebook says it launched its own jobs feature to ease the strain of job searches on its nearly 2 billion users. "This partnership with Google helps us accomplish that goal," Facebook product manager Gaurav Dosi said in a statement. Google for Jobs is good for the American economy and "has the potential to radically improve discovery of the millions of jobs on LinkedIn," Dan Shapero, vice president of careers and talent at LinkedIn, said in a statement.

Google says millions of people each day start their hunt for jobs on its search engine. But finding the right job can be a lot trickier than Googling the next movie times. Job posts are notoriously hard for search engines to classify because of the wide range of keywords used to describe job functions and inconsistency across industries and organizations in job titles. And many people have very specific requirements for the job they are seeking, such as location, accessibility to public transit and special skills. "It's something we see in the search logs. We see signs of our users being frustrated and being stressed while they're doing job seeking queries," he said. How it works For example, when conducting a search for sales jobs in Raleigh, North Carolina, openings will soon begin to appear at the top of results. A job seeker can narrow the search by applying filters, such as jobs posted in the last three days, entry level versus management roles, full-time roles versus part-time, and roles in a particular industry such as retail. Once a job seeker spots something promising, they can click through to the website where the listing is hosted and apply there. The goal for Google is to provide a comprehensive set of job postings that include blue-collar and white-collar positions, Zakrasek said. Google will also be able to point job seekers to jobs that have typically been much harder to search for and classify such as retail and service jobs. He recently received a thank you note from the brother of a Google engineer who found a job using the feature while it was being tested. "This guy had done computer repair, which means opening a computer box and fiddling with the wiring. It's kind of a dying job in this day and age and he had had trouble finding work," says Zakrasek. With Google for Jobs,  "he was able to find a position he hadn't seen anywhere else."

There were many new features announced that will enhance our day-to-day life, while (hopefully) making the lives of developers a bit easier, and improving our mobile devices ten-fold. To close out the show, Google has decided to share a list of all of the announcements that were made during the Keynote and various sessions that took place. We went through the list and cherry-picked some of the highlights, so without further adieu, here’s what Google I/O 2017 brought everyone. Google Assistant and Google Home Soon, with Google Lens—a new way for computers to “see”—you’ll be able to learn more about and take action on the things around you, while you’re in a conversation with your Assistant. We’ve brought your Google Assistant to iPhones. Call me maybe? With new hands-free calling on Google Home, you’ll be able to make calls with the Assistant to landlines and mobile numbers in U.S. and Canada for free. You can now type to your Google Assistant on eligible Android phones and iPhones. For developers, we’re bringing Actions on Google to the Assistant on phones—on both Android and iOS. Soon you’ll find conversation apps for the Assistant that help you do things like shopping for clothes or ordering food from a lengthy menu. AI, ML, and Cloud With the addition of Smart Reply to Gmail on Android and iOS, we’re using machine learning to make responding to emails easier for more than a billion Gmail users. With Google.ai, we’re pulling all our AI initiatives together to put more powerful computing tools and research in the hands of researchers, developers and companies. We’ve already seen promising research in the fields of pathology and DNA research. We must go deeper. AutoML uses neural nets to design neural nets, potentially cutting down the time-intensive process of setting up an AI system, and helping non-experts build AI for their particular needs. We introduced a new Google Cloud Platform service called Google Cloud IoT Core, which makes it easy for Google Cloud customers to gain business insights through secure device connections to our rich data and analytics tools. Google Photos We first launched Google Photos two years ago, and now it has more than 500 million monthly users. Soon Google Photos will give you sharing suggestions by selecting the right photos, and suggesting who you should send them to based on who was in them. Shared libraries will let you effortlessly share photos with a specific person. You can share your full photo library, or photos of certain people or from a certain date forward. Google Lens is coming to Photos later this year, so you’ll be able to look back on your photos to learn more or take action—like find more information about a painting from a photo you took in a museum. Android and Google Play We reached 2 billion monthly active devices on Android! Android O, coming later this year, is getting improvements to “vitals” like battery life and performance, and bringing more fluid experiences to your smaller screen, from improved notifications to autofill. Smart text selection in Android O improves copy and paste to recognize entities on the screen—like a complete address—so you can easily select text with a double tap, and even bring up an app like Maps to help navigate you there. We previewed a new initiative aimed at getting computing into the hands of more people on entry-level Android devices. Internally called Android Go, it’s designed to be relevant for people who have limited data connectivity and speak multiple languages. Android Auto is now supported by 300 car models, and Android Auto users have grown 10x since last year. Android Instant Apps are now open to all developers, so anyone can build and publish apps that can be run without requiring installation. Virtual and Augmented Reality More Daydream-ready phones are coming soon, including the Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8+, LG’s next flagship phone, and devices from Motorola and ASUS. We’re expanding Daydream to support standalone VR headsets, which don’t require a phone or PC. HTC VIVE and Lenovo are both working on devices, based on a Qualcomm reference design. The next smartphone with Tango technology will be the ASUS ZenFone AR, available this summer. We previewed Euphrates, the latest release of Daydream, which will let you capture what you’re seeing and cast your virtual world right onto the screen in your living room, coming later this year. We’re releasing an experimental build of Chromium with an augmented reality API, to help bring AR to the web YouTube Soon you’ll be able to watch and control 360-degree YouTube videos and live streams on your TV, and use your game controller or remote to pan around an immersive experience. Super Chat lets fans interact directly with YouTube creators during live streams by purchasing highlighted chat messages that stay pinned to the top of the chat window. We previewed a developer integration that showed how the Super Chat API can be used to trigger actions in the real world—such as turning the lights on and off in a creator’s apartment. A new feature in the YouTube VR app will soon let people watch and discuss videos together. Developer-Focused Updates With a new Google Payment API, developers can enable easy in-app or online payments for customers who already have credit and debit cards stored on Google properties. We’re bringing phone number authentication to Firebase, working closely with the Fabric Digits team, so your users can sign in to your apps with their phone numbers. We’re expanding Firebase Hosting to integrate with Cloud Functions, letting you can do things like send a notification when a user signs up or automatically create thumbnails when an image is uploaded to Cloud Storage. AdMob is also now integrated with Google Analytics for Firebase, giving developers a complete picture of ads revenue, mediation revenue and in-app purchase revenue in one place. Developers interested in testing the cutting edge of our products can now sign up for a Firebase Alpha program. That’s all folks.

It’s an annual event where the giant shows off the best they’ve got cooking. And throughout the show, one theme has been clear — Google loves AI and wants you on board. Google made its billions by being the people’s search engine. While it was far from the first, more robust algorithms and software helped the company build an empire. Now it’s looking to take the next step and replicate past success, this time, by mastering AI. Machine learning, cloud computing, etc. are the way of the future. They can already best humans in all kinds of tasks, and the exponential speed of development shows no signs of letting up. A good chunk of that progress can be attributed to Google’s TensorFlow software — one of the most advanced AI tools available. It’s so useful; it’s practically ubiquitous. “There’s hardly a way around TensorFlow these days,” Samim Winiger, head of machine learning design studio Samim.io, told The Verge. “I use a lot of open source learning libraries, but there’s been a major shift to TensorFlow.” The software works wonders. It’s fast, scalable, and effective, plus it integrates into Google’s own cloud services so that you can easily take advantage of the tech giant’s server farms for storage or computing power. And the company has an array of specialized chips that mimic neural networks and work well with the kind of parallelized software that AI and machine learning use. Everyone, of course, is at least working on AI. Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, and Facebook, all have their own tools and services and software, but Google’s ease of use, and willingness to buy up third party competitors and integrate those systems and techniques into their own have allowed them to subsume just about everyone else in the game. And that mean’s the search giant is leap-frogging just about everyone else. The Android Now personal assistant now has two billion monthly users — a significant chunk of the planet’s internet users. Plus, Google has no qualms about launching their services on rival platforms. We may not have heard too much from the Big G in a while, but it’s clear the company’s been hard at work fighting the next major battle for tech dominance years before everyone else.

How Google plans to tackle power consumption even more aggressively in Android Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/05/18 5:29pm PDTMay 18, 2017 13 Plus 1 on G+ 93 Share on Facebook 55 Share on Twitter Total Shares161 Android OS Development Google News Videos Yesterday at I/O Google had an interesting talk called Background Check and Other Insights into the Android Operating System Framework. It's a long name, but really it's about improving battery life in Android. It went on at great length as to how, exactly, they plan on doing that, and it's quite worth a watch. We have the video here, but if you don't have the half-hour to check it out, then you are welcome to read below. The central methodology Google is using to try to improve things is the idea of visibility. When something is running in the background and doing a ton of stuff like calling your location at quick intervals, it results in battery drain. So now Google wants to change how things happen in the background, by ensuring that free-running background services aren't sucking your battery dry. Background apps will be pushed out of memory when they leave the foreground, and requests for things like location or WiFi happening in the background will only occasionally see new information from Android. Applications that would otherwise receive broadcasts also might not wake up unless they are given an explicit call to do so in the broadcast, although there are some exceptions. Apps can still get around this by being foregrounded in some way, but now that will be something visible that the user is aware of. This focus on visibility for apps will also mean developers will have to make decisions about what is really better to the user. If doing an ongoing notification as a means of bypassing the stuff above would confuse a user, is that really the right thing for them to do in that case? Other tools can be used to schedule your tasks ahead of time or to wait for events like the job intent service that developers can use in both pre and post-O environments. Jobs and alarms also allow the OS to defer. So, if something happens that would trigger a bunch of other apps to wake up, like a new picture being taken, that can be passed to those apps one at a time after a delay. That way the user doesn't suddenly have a ton of performance issues and drain out of nowhere. Basically, Google wants to solve some of the problems with battery life by defining bad behaviors for developers, like persistent background services or accidental leaks to the background of typically foregrounded activities, and make it clear that things have to be done the right way going forward or their stuff won't work. But it's also giving them new tools and choices for how to best accomplish the things they need to do. The new features in the Play Console and in Android Studio should also help developers be aware of when they are making these mistakes so that they can be fixed. It's a matter of visibility for the developers as well as visibility for the users. To paraphrase Steve Balmer: Visibility, visibility, visibility. A significant user-facing change of this visibility mindset is a new battery menu in O, with a focus on actionable interaction. Instead of just seeing stuff like Screen and Google Play Services next to a number that they won't understand, now users will be given ways of interacting with that data if they don't like it, and can better see how they are using applications without needing to do a bunch of mental calculations. So, when a user has a problem with their expectations of battery performance and goes looking to see what might be causing it, they are more likely to find what caused it, understand what it means, and take action about it. All of these changes are is in pursuit of Google's holy grail: multi-day battery life. Right now the tools in software aren't all there, but these are steps that can take us in that direction.

Good feature to take from iOS Knowledgeborn Allah This does seem similar to what Apple implemented in iOS, but I'm curious about how this will impact RAM management. If it reduces the cache file too much, it'll just close the application completely, and you'll have to start over every time you want to use the app again. Apple somehow found a way around this problem, even in devices with less RAM, but I'm not too sure how Google will accomplish this. Even "doze" on my Pixel XL kills apps in the background all the time. This new thing sounds it could potentially make the problem worse. Justin Osborne Well I sure can tell a difference since upgrading, that's for sure. The new battery section makes me feel a lot better about how the battery is looking. But that's where it ends. Today, I got a full hour less out of my battery than normal. 2 hours vs 3-3.5 on the Pixel. That said, it's a beta, so I'm not complaining. It's definitely not the direction I want to go tho (nor are these new emoticons, sigh). marcusmarcus2 "Google's holy grail: multi-day battery life." I'm glad, but can we get a two pronged attack to address this. Yes, Google needs to keep improving the software side, but OEMs need to help out and quit making thinner phones. They are thin enough, give us more battery capacity. AbdulB1 actually they save quite a lot by putting small batteries in the phones instead of big ones. Krzysztof Jozwik I'm not sure you read OP's comment. Nothing was said about saving... AbdulB1 smaller capacity battery is much cheaper marcusmarcus2 My original comment was not about savings, cheapness, cost, etc. Jack Jennings You've said the same thing twice for no reason. Krzysztof Jozwik I wouldn't say "much" I'm no expert on the matter, but last I checked replacement batteries aren't that expensive, and I don't have the buying power of an oem AbdulB1 Most phones today dont have replacement batteries, they have unremovable ones. OEM or no OEM a 3000mAh battery will always be cheaper than 4000mAh one. marcusmarcus2 I can find batteries for my different Moto G phones that have "Non-User replaceable batteries" for nearly the same price as my LG phones that have user replaceable batteries online. Most likely the OEMs can get them for about the same as well so replaceable or not really does not matter. Either way, yes a 3000mAh battery will be cheaper than a 4000mAh one for OEMs, but probably not much at all, especially at the volume they would by at. I'm guessing they are choosing smaller batteries to make their phones thinner and not because it is slightly cheaper for them. Thinness is better to advertise to most consumers as most consumers are drawn to looks over functionality now a days. I still prefer function over looks for my devices. Krzysztof Jozwik And non replaceable will always be cheaper than replaceable. The point is, the batteries aren't the bulk of the cost. Geoff Johnson What the hell is your point? He never said anything about cost, he was just talking about stop making phones thinner for design and aesthetic reasons. james fuston The idea that smaller and thinner phones result in less battery life is a bit of a misnomer. For an example, I'd refer you to the iPhone SE. marcusmarcus2 I never said smaller and thinner. I just said thinner. They could make some of the phones the same height and width as the current one but make it a little thicker to give a thicker battery, and that would help with the battery life. james fuston Okay, but your general sentiment is still that battery life is tied directly to physical size which, again stating my example of the iPhone SE, isn't the case. The power draw of the components is far more important than the physical size of the phone. marcusmarcus2 My general sentiment is ONLY in regards to thickness of the phone. My sentiment is not to width or height, which also make up the size of the phone. The width and height is usually determined more by the screen where thickness is more often do to battery. A larger screen (component) will draw more power than a smaller screen, I agree with you there. But you seem to think the size of the battery does not make a difference, please correct me if I am wrong. Using your example of iPhone SE, if they would have made that a little thicker than it is now by making the battery larger, that would have made the battery life even longer than it already is. That is my point. james fuston > A larger screen (component) will draw more power than a smaller screen, I agree with you there. Let me give this one more shot. "your general sentiment is still that battery life is tied directly to physical size which, again stating my example of the iPhone SE, isn't the case" To break out the pieces, battery life is tied...to physical size...which, again...isn't the case. In other words, we do not agree. The iPhone SE is the exact same size as the iPhone 5S and it gets 30%+ better battery life purely through efficiency in components. To say high mAh results in long battery life is a misnomer that the G6 or V20 should be a clear reminder of. You also cannot equate physical size to battery capacity as energy density is not a universal measurement. marcusmarcus2 You are comparing different phones with different components. I agree with you that component efficiency has an effect on battery life. But... Let me give you one more shot. We will use your iPhone SE for this. If there were 2 versions of the SE. Both have the exact same components except one has a battery that is 1000 mAh larger than the other (thus making it slightly thicker), than the one with the larger battery would have more battery life, Thus the thicker one would have better battery life. That is what I am saying. I'm not comparing large phones to small phones. I'm saying if they had a larger battery in a phone with the exact same specs/components then the battery life would be better. That is all my point was. Do you not agree with that? EDIT: Yes, size of the battery may not increase with capacity due to density, but it usually will increase in size as it does increase in capacity, especially if it increases a lot. Geoff Johnson Again, you're talking about it being smaller. The iPhone SE gets good battery life because it has a 4" screen. The complaint is that phones are getting THINNER. Meaning that they still have 5.5-6" displays, but are thinner and translate to smaller batteries. james fuston Nope, not at all. The cell in the SE is about 50mAh bigger than the 5S (which is the exact same size). The 30%+ battery life improvement comes from more efficient components, not just their size. marcusmarcus2 Technically it is 2 dimensional train of thought. Also, if they increased it horizontally or vertically, then they would most likely have to increase the dimensions of the phone horizontally or vertically, thus changing the size of the screen or bezel. Increasing it thickness wise means they would not have to change the look of the of the front of the phone. Anywho, I'm only talking about thickness, not height, width, different components, different phones, not small phones or big phones. I'm talking just battery capacity, if all other components remain the same. Thickening the battery would add battery capacity without changing the over all look much at all. It could be any phone of your choosing. If adding a thicker/higher capacity battery to whatever 1 phone you want, that phone would have a longer battery life. Do you not agree with that logic? JD The SE wasn't thinner. Ryne Hager Give me a OnePlus with 5000mAh and I would be so happy. someone755 Give me a 4.7" phone like the og Moto X and I would be so happy. Neither of us are going to be happy, Ryne. Drakenoid OG Moto X updated for current year would be perfect for me. Kristian Ivanov I highly agree on the thin phones part. Bought a Huawei P10 2 days ago, for me, that thing is unusable without a case to make it a bit fatter. Karly Johnston If they fix idle battery drain that doesn't become an issue. marcusmarcus2 I'm not saying they should not fix battery drain. I'm saying if they fix battery drain AND add higher capacity battery (making phone a little thicker), they could increase battery life even more than just addressing one of them. So if fixing the battery drain adds another day and a thicker battery adds another day, you'd go from 1 day to 3 days instead of just 2 days from only fixing battery drain. Karly Johnston The battery life the current 625 phones are getting is where flagships need to be. That should be enough for anyone. marcusmarcus2 Everyone is not all the same. It may be enough for you. I'm saying, phones are beyond thin enough and could be thicker to increase battery life even more beyond what a 625 phone can do. Now, this is my opinion in regards to how I would like to use a phone. You are welcome to your own opinion. I'm not going to say what should be enough for anyone other than me. Karly Johnston The OEMs don't think that is what the vast majority of people need or want. Their target is a full day of battery life which is what most people are worried about. It isn't my opinion, it is the industry opinion of what the marketing priorities are. X-47B My phone has 4000 mAh battery, and it's 5.5-inch display. I easily get 2 days of battery even after heavy usage. Margaritas Ante Porcos Installed O on my 6p and battery still drains like a whore in a bukkake twelvesome. Google really can't do nothing at this point. Android is breaking to pieces. So many things needed to be fixed in O but instead Android's got even worse. That notification empty desert area of white grey nothingness kills me the most. Hate it really bad. The last Android I liked was 6th. catalysto Not sure what you're talking about. Battery life on my 6P with the new O is great. Maybe you have an aging battery? Margaritas Ante Porcos as long as your 6p works great, nothing else matters, right? Roy That's right. catalysto Just saying. My anecdotal evidence is as good as yours. And having poor battery life across multiple OS versions is a pretty strong indicator for a bad battery, don't ya think? In fact, I had the same problem with a previous 6P. iFeign Complain some more about your beta software Margaritas Ante Porcos It started with 7.1.2. Do you really need to be a btch when bad things happen to others? Roy For me everything goes smooth on my 6P on 7.1.2. so I need to complain that Android to good. The Wrath of Kahn If your 6P has shut down even once before reaching about 5% then you most likely have one of the defective batteries. I had to have mine replaced, but after that, it runs all day like a charm. ODP2 improved it, if anything. Margaritas Ante Porcos it was fine for a long time until I updated to 7.1.2. That update screwed the battery that was working superb all the time. DANA Try to do a factory reset, it fixes many problem for some user. Margaritas Ante Porcos It was one of the first things I did. Twice. Did not help. Paul_Werner Yeah you got to call Google (if you got yours from the Play Store). They've been replacing 6Ps with factory refurbished ones even out of warranty (source: it happened to me) Matthew Skalecki The update didn't screw up your battery. The battery was going to crap out on you regardless of which Android version you had. This happened to many people including me. Replacing the battery fixes the issue; reverting to a previous os does nothing. Zach Mauch Did you go through Google or a local shop? The Wrath of Kahn Unfortunately it was out of warranty, had a friend with the skills do it for me. JD I need more of this colorful imagery to describe simple everyday problems. mchalakov First off you are using a beta OS don't complain. Second thing is that battery drain comes mostly from the (bad)apps - if you watched the video or read the article you could understand. Third - I'm pretty sure you can go back to Marshmallow if you are so so so unhappy with Nougat or O. Jakst Really? Yesterday was my first day with Android O. I plugged my phone out at 7, and come home at midnight with 35 % battery left. I've never had that kind of battery life in my 6P before. So I've seen huge gains with this O preview. thereasoner The Android O beta I'm using is so slow to charge my Pixel today that it seems like that's what they tackled​....and not in a good way. iFeign Surprise, surprise, you're running BETA software. Smh. thereasoner Yeah I know and I'm sure it will get fixed between now and September. I'm just saying that the current difference in charge time is quite noticable at this point. AbdulB1 maybe they removed quick charge support in beta mattcoz Pixel never had quick charge. AbdulB1 hmm interesting. I thought it has qualcomm processor so it must have qc 3.0 too. Must be some proprietary stuff or qualcomm must be asking for more money to enable it. mattcoz Google is pushing the open USB-C power delivery standard. AbdulB1 Display screen eats up most of my battery. I can't see what google is doing will fix it somehow. We need different types of screens now. iFeign Uhh, it's as if you expect things to use NO battery at all. Infinite battery life! Of course using the screen, aka, using the phone, is going to be the largest proportionate power drain - no matter how fancy the screen tech. AbdulB1 battery tech has still not improved and nor did the screen tech. I can accept that the screen tech will remain same for a long time but as far as batteries are concerned they can be improved , made for longer number of recharge cycles but that hasn't caught up with the manufacturers yet. One thing which can be done is increasing the battery capacity but we all know this is not happening as phone manufactures think it will make phones bulky , add weight and in long term affect the sale of newer devices. Latheryin Multi day battery life will not happen until new battery tech comes around. With people needlessly having screen on times of 5+ hours there is no way to keep a battery charged for extended periods. Krzysztof Jozwik I average 2 hours of screen on time a day. Just because some use their phone 24/7 doesn't mean we all do. I have a job where I'm not on my phone, at home I have better screens to get info from. The phone is there when I need it. Your nonstop use case is not the norm. Latheryin As do I but that is not the norm. Might want to look at any forum about battery life and looking at screen on times. Most want and use 5+ hours. It's mainly the older generation like us that doesn't need it and are not on the device all the time. Krzysztof Jozwik Obviously the forums about battery life have people winning that they want 48 hours of screen on. That is not the norm. Sure, lots of people want that, most do not. Latheryin Most want more screen on time. Why do you think battery life is such an issue. disqusdeeznuts My Moto Z Play begs to differ. Motorola does it right with this phone. It has a good size battery (3510), an efficient processor, and runs smooth. It can be done, but for some reason, it just isn't a focus for a majority of manufacturers. Latheryin Well sure all the devices with that mid range chip and battery combo can get ok battery life. I could easily. Get 2 days out of my device and it only has a 3200 battery. It is not the oem. It's people. They need to spend less time look at their phone and more time living life. Which many are unprepared for. Cakefish I'm going the leaked Moto X4 continues that legacy onwards! Rod Ever heard of the Moto z Play, or Lenovo P2? Latheryin As already stated on that. The moto has a mid tear chip. As for the Lenovo, nope. Can't say I have, it's either not sold in my country or a mid low tier device that I wouldn't have noticed. Just looked. They both use the same mid tier chip. Also that does have a good battery. But that like the K1000 with a 10000 battery are the exception and seldom are they flagship quality. WarpspeedScp The Moto z does not have an SD 820 on it. Neither does the P2. It's very annoying that manufacturers can't give us something functional instead of eye-candy for once. Rod While it's not top of line sillicon, real world testes have proven that, for everyday tasks, there's virtually no difference between the S625 ans 821 WarpspeedScp Well, my phone has an SD 650, and dolphin emulator just about keeps up (wind waker and super smash Bros). On an 820, there would definitely be better results. Paul Troy I have a better idea. Get the hardware manufacturers to put a bigger battery in their devices. 💡 Taedirk If we could convince hardware manufacturers to do something useful, we wouldn't be on yet another revision to how Android updates the OS. Alex Yeah so this way the horrible wakelocks (that Android makes almost impossible to manage) will be less visible. Cakefish Why not both? Zach Mauch All I want to know is can they stop wakelocks. JD Same bullshit every year. I'll believe it when I see it. Unless Android O somehow allows me to download more mAh. Morten Ulv Are you trying to say Android battery life hasn't improved VASTLY over the years? JD Yep in fact it's regressed Morten Ulv I have no such issues. Better battery all across the board. JD What ever you're smoking pass that shit around Morten Ulv Your shit must be stronger than mine. browngeek I miss the days of my Xperia Z3 Lollipop and Stamina mode. Used to get 48 hours and 5-6 hours SOT. D13H4RD2L1V3 I hope this actually does something when the final build is out. I'm getting tired of hearing of every new battery improvement in a new version of Android only to have a wakelock pretty much make all of that moot. Dennis Ulijn I am on the Android O beta, and i must say that the information i get from it it really useful! I never could find the wakelocks because i'm not rooted, but now i can easily see what apps use up battery in the background. Awake meditation app was in use for 15 minutes (meditation) and active in the background for 1 hour (basically, ever since the meditation)! "Restrict background usage" to on, and we'll see what it brings tomorrow. PI this is interesting .... :) ,, Whats the current update Dennis Ulijn I'm in Europe so I just woke up. I'll let you know end of the day. Sabin Bajracharya Meanwhile Google's own apps will somehow be able to bypass this restriction :D Michael Sørensen Google's own location services, Now cards, Chrome, etc. eats the most battery for me - even worse with location history on. How about fixing that first...? WarpspeedScp Try Firefox! Also, turn location off as soon as you can. mlm5em But with O, you can now turn off Background activity on an app specific basis. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/eaaaef5de863733535628a24f5b0d44f888ae3ff0cb89d1c8cffc0680083c526.png mattcoz Good to see there's an option to turn it off. Morten Ulv Very handy! IncCo Anything that improves the battery life is awesome John Monks I have concerns about this. There are some apps I *want* running in the background, but I don't want them filling up the notification shade. One example, Lightflow has to have a pointless notification in order to do the job I installed it to do. I know it's there, any consequences for my battery life are mine to live with. It would be OK if I could toggle a setting to permit a particular app to run a 'free running background service' silently but this is Google so I expect I'll have to put up with spam instead (and no, collapsed notifications are still notifications), or there will be a toggle that does nothing, like the 'ignore optimisation' setting that currently exists. Drakenoid There apparently is, check comments above, there's a screenshot. Cakefish It's about damn time. All hail Android O. AdamH So does it mean my phone will be useless? something_new Apple was right then Đức Thành I'm beginning to get excited again, even knowing that actually achieving this would take many years. Fidelator Allow us, the end user, to have absolute control over which apps can run in the background under certain conditions, I have disabled notifications on Facebook and Instagram yet they still have multiple persistent RAM hogging battery sucking services 100% of the time smeddy My next phone won't get a look-in without a 4000mah+ battery in it. Since Samsung dropped the removable battery, battery anxiety has crept back into my life.

The Google Home app now features customizable user-defined shortcuts for Assistant Jordan Palmer Follow View All Posts 2017/05/17 2:03pm PDTMay 17, 2017 19 Plus 1 on G+ 65 Share on Facebook 37 Share on Twitter Total Shares121 Applications Google News One of the draws of having a personal assistant is being able to control various things through it. Alexa is popular partially for this reason and Google Home/Assistant has been slowly catching up since its launch. Just a few weeks ago, our very own Cody noticed that Google was implementing direct support for IFTTT in the Google app for user-defined actions. Well, this has finally appeared in the Home app in a "Shortcuts" menu in the Assistant section. These customizable user-defined shortcuts are very basic and anyone familiar with IFTTT will feel right at home (heh). The trigger is the "Ok Google, [blank]" phrase that you define, which activates a service like opening Google Play Music or sending a specific text to a certain contact. The best part? Not having to use the IFTTT website to manage your applets.   If you haven't taken up Tasker/AutoVoice/Assistant yet, this is a good way to get started. I am not sure if this is a server-side switch or an app update (I only noticed it this afternoon), but it's super cool nonetheless.

Interesting! But no IFTTT account required I guess, because I created a Todoist shortcut and didn't see any applets added to my IFTTT account on the web. Plus, invoking the shortcut just opens up the Todoist chat interface within the Assistant app, where it takes me through the normal workflow. Jordan Palmer Same. bozzykid Are we sure it is actually using IFTTT? Perhaps they just used ifttt in the UI elements since it is copying their features. XerBlade Considering all this is really doing is remapping Assistant commands to custom phrases (so it can't be used to do anything Assistant can't already do natively, plus you can't give it any variable phrases), I'm pretty sure this has absolutely nothing to do with IFTTT. Seriously, this does one thing and one thing only. You say one custom phrase, and it remaps it to a different phrase and acts as if you said that. tu3218 I just tried this and I don't get it. I selected the voice triggers but I don't see anywhere to actually select the service and the devices that I want to activate based on my command. What am I missing? Alex S it's literally just sending the command directly to assistant, just like if you said it outloud. It's just a way to shorten the command. tu3218 Hmm okay. I tried one and it worked. I see there's an option to turn up the TV. But it said I hadn't linked my Harmony account yet. I went to add devices but don't see Harmony. Seems like we're making progress. bozzykid Harmony is already available at least in the US. tu3218 Nothing here on my end. I am in the US. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/7ac7833390bcfeeef1844da6dbc20fc821f9a520d1b90b7b52c870faa3fcf10d.jpg bozzykid You are looking in the wrong place. Its under Assistant Apps. It has been available for months. create812 "It's just a way to shorten the command." This is the real take away here. Alex S A few things: A) It's SUPER specific and only recognizes the EXACT phrase you say. For example if you put "Good night" but assistant picks it up as "goodnight" it won't work. B) You can map multiple key phrases to one action but you cannot match multiple actions to one (or more) key phrases. Not sure why? This actually kind of sucks, because there's really no point to using shortcuts if you can't have multiple actions in one key phrase. Otherwise, why not just ask Google Assistant what you want directly? C) Is the menu broken for anyone else? If I switch to a different app then switch back to the Google Home at it duplicates the examples so the list gets twice as long, then three times, etc. Weird! bozzykid It also only recognizes commands formatted properly. If I have "Ask harmony..." it fails but if I input it as "Ask Harmony..." it works fine. Alex S yea that doesn't bug me as much as some of the other stuff like not being able to do two commands at once. don't really see what the point of this is right now? it's cool you can make commands shorter, though. bozzykid It is great for Harmony because saying "Hey Google, Ask Harmony to turn up the volume" is a bit ridiculous. At least I might actually use my Home for Harmony commands now. Amandafpotter Google is paying 97$ per hour!

Midnitte "The trigger is the "Ok Google, [blank]" phrase that you define, which activates a service like opening Google Play Music or sending a specific text to a certain contact. The best part? Not having to use the IFTTT website to manage your applets." When are they going to add the reverse? I want to be able to trigger the command "Hey Google, catch me up" remotely from something like dismissing my alarm. :/ Any other solution is either too convoluted, clunky, or unreliable. Austin Spangrud Biggest issue that I have is the response back from Google assistant. I have my garage door setup so when I state open garage door, assistant responds with ok opening garage door. But since my garage door is set up as a switch it says turning off garage door. I just want a custom response back. Dammit Google!! Ifttt will let me do it! Jason Creating a custom response is so much fun especially when showing off your little toy to your friends. Alfonso Surroca Sounds like IFTTT is still superior to Shortcuts, since you're able to write custom OK Google responses. "Turning off garage door" sounds annoying. Michael Rodgers I'm a bit confused. These settings are in Assistant, but they're only to be used in Google Home? iantrich No, any instance of Google Assistant. Google Home just happens to be the app that has such settings Chronocento Does this work with third party actions? Like, can you bind "OK Google, ask AutoVoice [something]" to "Ok Google, do [something]"? iantrich Yes. One of their examples is for the Harmony 3rd party action João Dias Yes, actually! :) Check here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lPWf-KR9M Chronocento Uao, a reply from João himself! :D Thanks for your great work, I love your AutoApps!!! create812 Anyone else notice how this year's I/O roll outs have gone much smoother and quicker than years past? I'm running Android O beta with little fuss, and have access to features as I hear about them (including these Assistant shortcuts). These are good times. Jerry Palmer How do I share shortcuts and home devices with other users? I have a bunch of shortcuts set up for Harmony. However, my wife is unable to activate them with her voice because we have multiple users setup and none of the shortcuts or home control devices show up in the Home app or Google Assistant for her. Tj Hariharan Google needs to powerup their voice commands, they can so easily make it more powerful than IFTTT - by offering up a way to one one-to-many or many-to-one voice commands and some automations as well. Heck home automation could be built into android and assistant. (things like location and time of day etc). As it stands IFTTT still can't do "if i'm home AND it's after sunset turn my lights on".

Podcasts & Newsletter Service Teaching German Teaching German DW im Unterricht Unterrichtsreihen Deutschlehrer-Info Germany World Business Science Environment Culture Sports TOP STORIES News How Google envisions the future of journalism From the prospect of innovation to the challenges of the industry, Google has offered an optimistic prognosis for journalism. DW caught up with Google's head of publishing and news in Europe to discuss the details. With the proliferation of new technologies threatening to upend journalism as we know it, news outlets have concerned themselves with how to reinvent their existence online. DW caught up with Gerrit Rabenstein, who heads Google's strategic partnerships, publishing and news in Europe, at the International Press Institute's World Congress to discuss how technology can help shape the future of journalism in a positive way. Deutsche Welle: How do you envision the future of journalism? I see so many new initiatives at the grassroots level that are extremely colorful and very innovative, and sometimes trying to go deep and far. I'm extremely optimistic we will find new ways. Those ways will look different than the ways we do news business today, the ways legacy players do today. But I'm sure that from this new wave of journalistic makers, new ideas will emerge. How do you envision Google's role in facilitating this future for journalism? We are participating with small and big startups, institutions and academics within the Digital News Initiative in a discussion about the future of journalism. We are engaging there in a discussion about new business models, about new ways of distributing content. In the discussion with the news industry, we are one player among others. Journalists play a role, publishers play a role, tech companies play a role. We'd love to see more tech companies engaging in this discussion, because I honestly and seriously only believe that we can solve the problems facing the industry if we come together and think from our different perspectives on this hard nut to crack: What does sustainable journalism look like in the future? Google Head of Strategic Relations Gerrit Rabenstein What are the challenges to bringing about this future Google is helping to build? The challenge for the news ecosystem is that the changes taking place in the industry are happening so incredibly fast. We went from print to digital, from digital to mobile. Tomorrow, the topic will be machine learning. So you have to build your news production company a new engine while its still running. The challenges don't get smaller. The challenges remain, or even increase or accelerate. In this complex world for news, there is no single silver bullet. The answer will be addressed very precisely for one player, and each player has to find the answer that fits for him or her. Concerning so-called "fake news," which many in the industry have seen as an existential threat, how does Google tackle this problem? We work on the topic of false news or misinformation at various ends. Internally, we updated our guidelines and made them much more strict. We launched something called the "fact check" label, which is open source software that a publisher can add to an article, a fact-checked article, and we can better surface that to an asked question. We also updated our rater guidelines so that the folks who have a second look at the quality of search results can better understand what would be a good search result for a certain query. At the same time, we are also working with external partners. We are partners of the First Draft coalition of 2015, which is an open forum to engage in the verification of content. We worked with the First Draft organization and many publications during the French presidential election, and now we're working with them on the German parliamentary election. We also engage with the topic of misinformation at the Digital News Initiative fund. We fund 25 projects that were established in 2015 and 2016, way before it became a major topic of public interest. We support those projects that tackle misinformation and hate speech from their different perspectives. So we tackle it both internally and externally. If you could say one thing to journalists, what would you say? Don't ask "why," ask "why not. " We all have to open up our minds to the possibilities and chances that are out there. I'm not saying there aren't challenges. I'm completely aware that it's very difficult, but we can overcome them if we ask: "Why don't we try this?" Let's give it a try. Gerret Rabenstein is the Head of Strategic Partnerships, News and Publishing at Google. He supports Google's partners in Germany, Austria and Switzerland as part of the newly founded Digital News Initiative.

Naturally, with Google I/O taking place after this big “leak”, there was bound to be some type of response by Google and it came from Google’s VP of engineering for Android, Dave Burke. During yesterday’s Android Fireside Chat, Burke was asked “how does Fuchsia relate to Android”, leaving a lot of us sitting on the edge of our seats. However, the answer was what you would expect from someone speaking on behalf of Google. Here’s his answer in full: How do you spell Fuchsia? Fuchsia is an early stage experimental project. We, you know, we actually have lots of cool early projects at Google. I think what’s interesting here is its open source, so people can see it and comment on it. Like lots of early stage projects it’s gonna probably pivot and morph. There’s some really smart people on it, people we’ve worked with who are great. and so, kind of exciting to see what happens. But it’s definitely a diff– sort of independent project to Android. and yeah, that’s basically it. In summary, it’s another open-source Google side project that will likely never see the light of day. Or Burke could have just been trying to throw everyone off the scent of something bigger in the works. It’s also important to note that Fuchsia has been in the works for the better part of 6 months, but a working APK gave everyone some excitement, but don’t get your hopes up. Either way, this is the best non-answer that you’re going to get for now. So let us know in the comments what you actually think Fuchsia could be morphed into, whether it be for our mobile devices or something else.

How Google plans to tackle power consumption even more aggressively in Android Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/05/18 5:29pm PDTMay 18, 2017 13 Plus 1 on G+ 93 Share on Facebook 55 Share on Twitter Total Shares161 Android OS Development Google News Videos Yesterday at I/O Google had an interesting talk called Background Check and Other Insights into the Android Operating System Framework. It's a long name, but really it's about improving battery life in Android. It went on at great length as to how, exactly, they plan on doing that, and it's quite worth a watch. We have the video here, but if you don't have the half-hour to check it out, then you are welcome to read below. The central methodology Google is using to try to improve things is the idea of visibility. When something is running in the background and doing a ton of stuff like calling your location at quick intervals, it results in battery drain. So now Google wants to change how things happen in the background, by ensuring that free-running background services aren't sucking your battery dry. Background apps will be pushed out of memory when they leave the foreground, and requests for things like location or WiFi happening in the background will only occasionally see new information from Android. Applications that would otherwise receive broadcasts also might not wake up unless they are given an explicit call to do so in the broadcast, although there are some exceptions. Apps can still get around this by being foregrounded in some way, but now that will be something visible that the user is aware of. This focus on visibility for apps will also mean developers will have to make decisions about what is really better to the user. If doing an ongoing notification as a means of bypassing the stuff above would confuse a user, is that really the right thing for them to do in that case? Other tools can be used to schedule your tasks ahead of time or to wait for events like the job intent service that developers can use in both pre and post-O environments. Jobs and alarms also allow the OS to defer. So, if something happens that would trigger a bunch of other apps to wake up, like a new picture being taken, that can be passed to those apps one at a time after a delay. That way the user doesn't suddenly have a ton of performance issues and drain out of nowhere. Basically, Google wants to solve some of the problems with battery life by defining bad behaviors for developers, like persistent background services or accidental leaks to the background of typically foregrounded activities, and make it clear that things have to be done the right way going forward or their stuff won't work. But it's also giving them new tools and choices for how to best accomplish the things they need to do. The new features in the Play Console and in Android Studio should also help developers be aware of when they are making these mistakes so that they can be fixed. It's a matter of visibility for the developers as well as visibility for the users. To paraphrase Steve Balmer: Visibility, visibility, visibility. A significant user-facing change of this visibility mindset is a new battery menu in O, with a focus on actionable interaction. Instead of just seeing stuff like Screen and Google Play Services next to a number that they won't understand, now users will be given ways of interacting with that data if they don't like it, and can better see how they are using applications without needing to do a bunch of mental calculations. So, when a user has a problem with their expectations of battery performance and goes looking to see what might be causing it, they are more likely to find what caused it, understand what it means, and take action about it. All of these changes are is in pursuit of Google's holy grail: multi-day battery life. Right now the tools in software aren't all there, but these are steps that can take us in that direction.

Good feature to take from iOS Knowledgeborn Allah This does seem similar to what Apple implemented in iOS, but I'm curious about how this will impact RAM management. If it reduces the cache file too much, it'll just close the application completely, and you'll have to start over every time you want to use the app again. Apple somehow found a way around this problem, even in devices with less RAM, but I'm not too sure how Google will accomplish this. Even "doze" on my Pixel XL kills apps in the background all the time. This new thing sounds it could potentially make the problem worse. Justin Osborne Well I sure can tell a difference since upgrading, that's for sure. The new battery section makes me feel a lot better about how the battery is looking. But that's where it ends. Today, I got a full hour less out of my battery than normal. 2 hours vs 3-3.5 on the Pixel. That said, it's a beta, so I'm not complaining. It's definitely not the direction I want to go tho (nor are these new emoticons, sigh). marcusmarcus2 "Google's holy grail: multi-day battery life." I'm glad, but can we get a two pronged attack to address this. Yes, Google needs to keep improving the software side, but OEMs need to help out and quit making thinner phones. They are thin enough, give us more battery capacity. AbdulB1 actually they save quite a lot by putting small batteries in the phones instead of big ones. Krzysztof Jozwik I'm not sure you read OP's comment. Nothing was said about saving... AbdulB1 smaller capacity battery is much cheaper marcusmarcus2 My original comment was not about savings, cheapness, cost, etc. Jack Jennings You've said the same thing twice for no reason. Krzysztof Jozwik I wouldn't say "much" I'm no expert on the matter, but last I checked replacement batteries aren't that expensive, and I don't have the buying power of an oem AbdulB1 Most phones today dont have replacement batteries, they have unremovable ones. OEM or no OEM a 3000mAh battery will always be cheaper than 4000mAh one. marcusmarcus2 I can find batteries for my different Moto G phones that have "Non-User replaceable batteries" for nearly the same price as my LG phones that have user replaceable batteries online. Most likely the OEMs can get them for about the same as well so replaceable or not really does not matter. Either way, yes a 3000mAh battery will be cheaper than a 4000mAh one for OEMs, but probably not much at all, especially at the volume they would by at. I'm guessing they are choosing smaller batteries to make their phones thinner and not because it is slightly cheaper for them. Thinness is better to advertise to most consumers as most consumers are drawn to looks over functionality now a days. I still prefer function over looks for my devices. Krzysztof Jozwik And non replaceable will always be cheaper than replaceable. The point is, the batteries aren't the bulk of the cost. Geoff Johnson What the hell is your point? He never said anything about cost, he was just talking about stop making phones thinner for design and aesthetic reasons. james fuston The idea that smaller and thinner phones result in less battery life is a bit of a misnomer. For an example, I'd refer you to the iPhone SE. marcusmarcus2 I never said smaller and thinner. I just said thinner. They could make some of the phones the same height and width as the current one but make it a little thicker to give a thicker battery, and that would help with the battery life. james fuston Okay, but your general sentiment is still that battery life is tied directly to physical size which, again stating my example of the iPhone SE, isn't the case. The power draw of the components is far more important than the physical size of the phone. marcusmarcus2 My general sentiment is ONLY in regards to thickness of the phone. My sentiment is not to width or height, which also make up the size of the phone. The width and height is usually determined more by the screen where thickness is more often do to battery. A larger screen (component) will draw more power than a smaller screen, I agree with you there. But you seem to think the size of the battery does not make a difference, please correct me if I am wrong. Using your example of iPhone SE, if they would have made that a little thicker than it is now by making the battery larger, that would have made the battery life even longer than it already is. That is my point. james fuston > A larger screen (component) will draw more power than a smaller screen, I agree with you there. Let me give this one more shot. "your general sentiment is still that battery life is tied directly to physical size which, again stating my example of the iPhone SE, isn't the case" To break out the pieces, battery life is tied...to physical size...which, again...isn't the case. In other words, we do not agree. The iPhone SE is the exact same size as the iPhone 5S and it gets 30%+ better battery life purely through efficiency in components. To say high mAh results in long battery life is a misnomer that the G6 or V20 should be a clear reminder of. You also cannot equate physical size to battery capacity as energy density is not a universal measurement. marcusmarcus2 You are comparing different phones with different components. I agree with you that component efficiency has an effect on battery life. But... Let me give you one more shot. We will use your iPhone SE for this. If there were 2 versions of the SE. Both have the exact same components except one has a battery that is 1000 mAh larger than the other (thus making it slightly thicker), than the one with the larger battery would have more battery life, Thus the thicker one would have better battery life. That is what I am saying. I'm not comparing large phones to small phones. I'm saying if they had a larger battery in a phone with the exact same specs/components then the battery life would be better. That is all my point was. Do you not agree with that? EDIT: Yes, size of the battery may not increase with capacity due to density, but it usually will increase in size as it does increase in capacity, especially if it increases a lot. Geoff Johnson Again, you're talking about it being smaller. The iPhone SE gets good battery life because it has a 4" screen. The complaint is that phones are getting THINNER. Meaning that they still have 5.5-6" displays, but are thinner and translate to smaller batteries. james fuston Nope, not at all. The cell in the SE is about 50mAh bigger than the 5S (which is the exact same size). The 30%+ battery life improvement comes from more efficient components, not just their size. marcusmarcus2 Technically it is 2 dimensional train of thought. Also, if they increased it horizontally or vertically, then they would most likely have to increase the dimensions of the phone horizontally or vertically, thus changing the size of the screen or bezel. Increasing it thickness wise means they would not have to change the look of the of the front of the phone. Anywho, I'm only talking about thickness, not height, width, different components, different phones, not small phones or big phones. I'm talking just battery capacity, if all other components remain the same. Thickening the battery would add battery capacity without changing the over all look much at all. It could be any phone of your choosing. If adding a thicker/higher capacity battery to whatever 1 phone you want, that phone would have a longer battery life. Do you not agree with that logic? JD The SE wasn't thinner. Ryne Hager Give me a OnePlus with 5000mAh and I would be so happy. someone755 Give me a 4.7" phone like the og Moto X and I would be so happy. Neither of us are going to be happy, Ryne. Drakenoid OG Moto X updated for current year would be perfect for me. Kristian Ivanov I highly agree on the thin phones part. Bought a Huawei P10 2 days ago, for me, that thing is unusable without a case to make it a bit fatter. Karly Johnston If they fix idle battery drain that doesn't become an issue. marcusmarcus2 I'm not saying they should not fix battery drain. I'm saying if they fix battery drain AND add higher capacity battery (making phone a little thicker), they could increase battery life even more than just addressing one of them. So if fixing the battery drain adds another day and a thicker battery adds another day, you'd go from 1 day to 3 days instead of just 2 days from only fixing battery drain. Karly Johnston The battery life the current 625 phones are getting is where flagships need to be. That should be enough for anyone. marcusmarcus2 Everyone is not all the same. It may be enough for you. I'm saying, phones are beyond thin enough and could be thicker to increase battery life even more beyond what a 625 phone can do. Now, this is my opinion in regards to how I would like to use a phone. You are welcome to your own opinion. I'm not going to say what should be enough for anyone other than me. Karly Johnston The OEMs don't think that is what the vast majority of people need or want. Their target is a full day of battery life which is what most people are worried about. It isn't my opinion, it is the industry opinion of what the marketing priorities are. X-47B My phone has 4000 mAh battery, and it's 5.5-inch display. I easily get 2 days of battery even after heavy usage. Margaritas Ante Porcos Installed O on my 6p and battery still drains like a whore in a bukkake twelvesome. Google really can't do nothing at this point. Android is breaking to pieces. So many things needed to be fixed in O but instead Android's got even worse. That notification empty desert area of white grey nothingness kills me the most. Hate it really bad. The last Android I liked was 6th. catalysto Not sure what you're talking about. Battery life on my 6P with the new O is great. Maybe you have an aging battery? Margaritas Ante Porcos as long as your 6p works great, nothing else matters, right? Roy That's right. catalysto Just saying. My anecdotal evidence is as good as yours. And having poor battery life across multiple OS versions is a pretty strong indicator for a bad battery, don't ya think? In fact, I had the same problem with a previous 6P. iFeign Complain some more about your beta software Margaritas Ante Porcos It started with 7.1.2. Do you really need to be a btch when bad things happen to others? Roy For me everything goes smooth on my 6P on 7.1.2. so I need to complain that Android to good. The Wrath of Kahn If your 6P has shut down even once before reaching about 5% then you most likely have one of the defective batteries. I had to have mine replaced, but after that, it runs all day like a charm. ODP2 improved it, if anything. Margaritas Ante Porcos it was fine for a long time until I updated to 7.1.2. That update screwed the battery that was working superb all the time. DANA Try to do a factory reset, it fixes many problem for some user. Margaritas Ante Porcos It was one of the first things I did. Twice. Did not help. Paul_Werner Yeah you got to call Google (if you got yours from the Play Store). They've been replacing 6Ps with factory refurbished ones even out of warranty (source: it happened to me) Matthew Skalecki The update didn't screw up your battery. The battery was going to crap out on you regardless of which Android version you had. This happened to many people including me. Replacing the battery fixes the issue; reverting to a previous os does nothing. Zach Mauch Did you go through Google or a local shop? The Wrath of Kahn Unfortunately it was out of warranty, had a friend with the skills do it for me. JD I need more of this colorful imagery to describe simple everyday problems. mchalakov First off you are using a beta OS don't complain. Second thing is that battery drain comes mostly from the (bad)apps - if you watched the video or read the article you could understand. Third - I'm pretty sure you can go back to Marshmallow if you are so so so unhappy with Nougat or O. Jakst Really? Yesterday was my first day with Android O. I plugged my phone out at 7, and come home at midnight with 35 % battery left. I've never had that kind of battery life in my 6P before. So I've seen huge gains with this O preview. thereasoner The Android O beta I'm using is so slow to charge my Pixel today that it seems like that's what they tackled​....and not in a good way. iFeign Surprise, surprise, you're running BETA software. Smh. thereasoner Yeah I know and I'm sure it will get fixed between now and September. I'm just saying that the current difference in charge time is quite noticable at this point. AbdulB1 maybe they removed quick charge support in beta mattcoz Pixel never had quick charge. AbdulB1 hmm interesting. I thought it has qualcomm processor so it must have qc 3.0 too. Must be some proprietary stuff or qualcomm must be asking for more money to enable it. mattcoz Google is pushing the open USB-C power delivery standard. AbdulB1 Display screen eats up most of my battery. I can't see what google is doing will fix it somehow. We need different types of screens now. iFeign Uhh, it's as if you expect things to use NO battery at all. Infinite battery life! Of course using the screen, aka, using the phone, is going to be the largest proportionate power drain - no matter how fancy the screen tech. AbdulB1 battery tech has still not improved and nor did the screen tech. I can accept that the screen tech will remain same for a long time but as far as batteries are concerned they can be improved , made for longer number of recharge cycles but that hasn't caught up with the manufacturers yet. One thing which can be done is increasing the battery capacity but we all know this is not happening as phone manufactures think it will make phones bulky , add weight and in long term affect the sale of newer devices. Latheryin Multi day battery life will not happen until new battery tech comes around. With people needlessly having screen on times of 5+ hours there is no way to keep a battery charged for extended periods. Krzysztof Jozwik I average 2 hours of screen on time a day. Just because some use their phone 24/7 doesn't mean we all do. I have a job where I'm not on my phone, at home I have better screens to get info from. The phone is there when I need it. Your nonstop use case is not the norm. Latheryin As do I but that is not the norm. Might want to look at any forum about battery life and looking at screen on times. Most want and use 5+ hours. It's mainly the older generation like us that doesn't need it and are not on the device all the time. Krzysztof Jozwik Obviously the forums about battery life have people winning that they want 48 hours of screen on. That is not the norm. Sure, lots of people want that, most do not. Latheryin Most want more screen on time. Why do you think battery life is such an issue. disqusdeeznuts My Moto Z Play begs to differ. Motorola does it right with this phone. It has a good size battery (3510), an efficient processor, and runs smooth. It can be done, but for some reason, it just isn't a focus for a majority of manufacturers. Latheryin Well sure all the devices with that mid range chip and battery combo can get ok battery life. I could easily. Get 2 days out of my device and it only has a 3200 battery. It is not the oem. It's people. They need to spend less time look at their phone and more time living life. Which many are unprepared for. Cakefish I'm going the leaked Moto X4 continues that legacy onwards! Rod Ever heard of the Moto z Play, or Lenovo P2? Latheryin As already stated on that. The moto has a mid tear chip. As for the Lenovo, nope. Can't say I have, it's either not sold in my country or a mid low tier device that I wouldn't have noticed. Just looked. They both use the same mid tier chip. Also that does have a good battery. But that like the K1000 with a 10000 battery are the exception and seldom are they flagship quality. WarpspeedScp The Moto z does not have an SD 820 on it. Neither does the P2. It's very annoying that manufacturers can't give us something functional instead of eye-candy for once. Rod While it's not top of line sillicon, real world testes have proven that, for everyday tasks, there's virtually no difference between the S625 ans 821 WarpspeedScp Well, my phone has an SD 650, and dolphin emulator just about keeps up (wind waker and super smash Bros). On an 820, there would definitely be better results. Paul Troy I have a better idea. Get the hardware manufacturers to put a bigger battery in their devices. 💡 Taedirk If we could convince hardware manufacturers to do something useful, we wouldn't be on yet another revision to how Android updates the OS. Alex Yeah so this way the horrible wakelocks (that Android makes almost impossible to manage) will be less visible. Cakefish Why not both? Zach Mauch All I want to know is can they stop wakelocks. JD Same bullshit every year. I'll believe it when I see it. Unless Android O somehow allows me to download more mAh. Morten Ulv Are you trying to say Android battery life hasn't improved VASTLY over the years? JD Yep in fact it's regressed Morten Ulv I have no such issues. Better battery all across the board. JD What ever you're smoking pass that shit around Morten Ulv Your shit must be stronger than mine. browngeek I miss the days of my Xperia Z3 Lollipop and Stamina mode. Used to get 48 hours and 5-6 hours SOT. D13H4RD2L1V3 I hope this actually does something when the final build is out. I'm getting tired of hearing of every new battery improvement in a new version of Android only to have a wakelock pretty much make all of that moot. Dennis Ulijn I am on the Android O beta, and i must say that the information i get from it it really useful! I never could find the wakelocks because i'm not rooted, but now i can easily see what apps use up battery in the background. Awake meditation app was in use for 15 minutes (meditation) and active in the background for 1 hour (basically, ever since the meditation)! "Restrict background usage" to on, and we'll see what it brings tomorrow. PI this is interesting .... :) ,, Whats the current update Dennis Ulijn I'm in Europe so I just woke up. I'll let you know end of the day. Sabin Bajracharya Meanwhile Google's own apps will somehow be able to bypass this restriction :D Michael Sørensen Google's own location services, Now cards, Chrome, etc. eats the most battery for me - even worse with location history on. How about fixing that first...? WarpspeedScp Try Firefox! Also, turn location off as soon as you can. mlm5em But with O, you can now turn off Background activity on an app specific basis. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/eaaaef5de863733535628a24f5b0d44f888ae3ff0cb89d1c8cffc0680083c526.png mattcoz Good to see there's an option to turn it off. Morten Ulv Very handy! IncCo Anything that improves the battery life is awesome John Monks I have concerns about this. There are some apps I *want* running in the background, but I don't want them filling up the notification shade. One example, Lightflow has to have a pointless notification in order to do the job I installed it to do. I know it's there, any consequences for my battery life are mine to live with. It would be OK if I could toggle a setting to permit a particular app to run a 'free running background service' silently but this is Google so I expect I'll have to put up with spam instead (and no, collapsed notifications are still notifications), or there will be a toggle that does nothing, like the 'ignore optimisation' setting that currently exists. Drakenoid There apparently is, check comments above, there's a screenshot. Cakefish It's about damn time. All hail Android O. AdamH So does it mean my phone will be useless? something_new Apple was right then Đức Thành I'm beginning to get excited again, even knowing that actually achieving this would take many years. Fidelator Allow us, the end user, to have absolute control over which apps can run in the background under certain conditions, I have disabled notifications on Facebook and Instagram yet they still have multiple persistent RAM hogging battery sucking services 100% of the time smeddy My next phone won't get a look-in without a 4000mah+ battery in it. Since Samsung dropped the removable battery, battery anxiety has crept back into my life.

Although it is already quick and easy to trigger Assistant with your voice and ask a question, you couldn’t use it when in a quiet environment. Now that keyboard should be rolling out to all, which form of input do you prefer using? UAG Samsung Galaxy S8 Cases We got our first hint that Google might be adding keyboard input to Assistant back in January after an APK teardown. Now that it is here, users can use it within Assistant by just tapping on the keyboard icon after launching the virtual assistant. There are pros and cons for each use case. The quickest way to activate Assistant is by using the “Ok, Google” phrase and then asking it a question. The downside of this is that you don’t always want to ask it a question out loud and then have it vocally respond. Using the keyboard fixes these issues, but the process can be much slower as there are several steps required before you can type in your query. So, do you prefer using keyboard input or voice input when communicating with Google Assistant? Or does your preference depend on the situation?

Companies pay Google so their adverts appear first on searches such as ‘how to beat cancer’. And experts say that many of the medical treatments sold by these advertisers would put patients at serious risk. Google auctions advertising space to firms selling bogus medicines so they can target users with life-threatening illnesses Experts say that many of the medical treatments sold by these advertisers would put patients at serious risk Others targeted include sufferers of HIV and mental-health problems. Firms that sell diet pills also pay the search engine so that their adverts are prominent when insecure girls type in the phrase: ‘Weight loss for teens.’ And money-lenders pay a premium to target needy Britons searching for ‘no credit check loans’. Google makes huge profits selling this advertising space based on these specific search terms used by desperate people. Last night campaigners accused Google of ‘mugging the most vulnerable members of our society, those who are clinging to life and desperate for hope’. It comes amid growing fury at Google’s links to vile content online. The technology giant has previously been found to profit from hate speech on its YouTube video site. RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next GP and her nurse husband trafficked a Nigerian 'slave nanny'... Three event workers are injured after fire breaks out at... Share this article Share The Conservative manifesto pledges to crack down on social-media sites ‘to protect the vulnerable and give people confidence to use the internet without fear of abuse, criminality or exposure to horrific content’. Advertising space on the search engine is sold through auction, with companies bidding to appear top of search results – then paying Google each time their link is clicked on. A Mail reporter signed up as a potential advertiser with Google. He found that the site was looking for advertisers targeting Britons with ‘health conditions and concerns’, including cancer, depression, eating disorders, Aids and HIV, vision loss, dementia, diabetes, menopause and learning disabilities. Firms bid about £1.30 per click for their products or services to appear first under the search phrase: ‘How to beat cancer.’ This means the prominent adverts under these results included one for an Indian firm promising to ‘fight cancer with herbs’ – using supplements made from ginger, gooseberry and aloe vera. But experts believe the treatment could actually harm patients’ chances of beating the disease. Other alternative medicine companies bid about £2 per click for their adverts to appear on searches for ‘natural cures for cancer’. The advertisements that appeared for this promised cures without chemotherapy at clinics in Mexico and Germany. And Google also profits from searches by those suffering mental-health problems. Companies bid to pay the technology giant about 83p per click to have their adverts appear when Britons search for ‘anxiety relief’. This means the top results for this search on Google are adverts trying to sell herbal remedies. Experts say that the pills can be extremely dangerous as there is no proof that they work and so they could prevent or delay people with mental-health problems seeking proper medical help. Terms auctioned to unscrupulous weight-loss pill companies for about £1 per click include: ‘weight loss for teens’, ‘weight loss pills for teenage girl’, ‘safe weight loss pills’ and ‘quick weight loss pills’. Others who are targeted by the adverts include those worried about memory loss and older men with erectile dysfunction. Payday loan companies spend up to £6.85 per click to appear first when people in financial trouble search Google for ‘payday loan’, ‘quick loans’ and ‘payday loans no credit check’. Last night Conservative candidate for Totnes Dr Sarah Wollaston, an ex-GP and former chairman of the Commons health select committee, said: ‘Google should not duck responsibility for the content of adverts, especially those targeting vulnerable people with quack remedies.’ Companies bid to pay the technology giant about 83p per click to have their adverts appear when Britons search for ‘anxiety relief’ Pharmacist Sultan Dajani, who is also spokesman for the Royal Pharmaceutical Society, added: ‘Information technology was meant to be a tool for empowering and enabling information but here it is being used to mug the most vulnerable members of our society, those who are clinging to life and desperate for hope. ‘Google has a moral duty to take a more professional, ethical and responsible approach. It must stop snake-oil salesmen benefiting and profiteering from others’ misery.’ Former minister Baroness Altmann, a finance campaigner, said: ‘It really does seem disappointing that a firm such as Google would want to profit from promoting such ruinously expensive loans to potentially vulnerable people, desperate to borrow money.’ Google has faced criticism for its links to dangerous content online. After the Westminster atrocity in March, the Mail revealed that jihadi guides to mounting a car terror attack could be found in seconds using the search engine. After being contacted by the Mail, Google removed alternative medicine adverts that we found which targeted people with cancer and HIV, women going through the menopause and teenagers looking for weight loss pills. It is reviewing payday loan adverts. But other adverts that were flagged by the Mail – including those targeting people with anxiety and memory loss – remained on Google, as they were not deemed to break company policies. Google says that it has strict rules for healthcare advertisers banning false claims and any advertisements found to have broken these policies are removed. The firm says it uses a third-party firm to monitor advert results and has banned adverts from payday loan firms that demand repayment within 60 days. A spokesman added: ‘We have a set of strict policies which govern what ads we allow on Google. ‘We do not allow ads that promote false or misleading health claims and quickly take action when we discover ads that break our policies.’   Share or comment on this article e-mail 6 shares Most watched News videos Dramatic scene of Time Square attacker leaping out of crashed car Man slaps racist woman after she calls him the n-word on a bus Times Square crash victim posted this video just before she died Dog enjoys playful tickle before suddenly falling asleep Moment suspected sex attacker stalks woman on her phone Weiner leaves court after pleading guilty to sexting a minor Chris Cornell's last performance with Soundgarden in Detroit No, NO, Next Question!

You'd be forgiven for feeling like this year was kind of a dud. There were no new gadgets, no new moonshot projects, and not even cool new swag like Google Cardboard headsets. The keynote was essentially just a boring two-hour lecture about small, incremental updates to existing products. Image: AP We're not alone in thinking so, either! Is it just me or is #GoogleIO less surprising then any year before, all incremental developments, no big leaps, almost boring — Erik Jonker (@ErikJonker) May 17, 2017 Google IO 2017 : the most boring keynote ever ! — Aurélien Guillard (@a_guillard) May 17, 2017 This year's keynote presentation was very out of character for the search giant. Google events in the past have typically included product launches like new Android devices, Chromebooks, Daydream VR, Google Home, and other things you could touch and see. But this year, Google seemed to be concentrating its efforts on refining those products with artificial intelligence, cloud infrastructure, and other improvements behind the scenes. Consider one of the most interesting announcements at the Google I/O keynote, Google Lens, which adds image recognition to existing apps like Assistant and Photos. It essentially lets you point your phone's camera at a flower, and it will tell you what type of plant it is, or you could point it at a restaurant, and on your screen you'd see reviews. The feature is illustrative of the AI technology that Google is currently building that isn't a standalone product. This is true of most of the impressive developments at Google. They aren't quite as visible as older products were. A great example is Google's new Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) that are processors made specifically for machine learning. The new TPUs debuted at the keynote presentation this week and were perhaps the most innovative thing Google announced — but they didn't quite capture the hype as older products because they're made for businesses and researchers, not everyday consumers. This, of course, doesn't mean that Google is out of good ideas. It's still one of the most sophisticated and valuable companies in the world. Google certainly isn't done making with hardware and new software — we're expecting a snazzy new Pixel phone with a curved screen later this year — but its decade-long run of launching products in flashy new categories like virtual reality and wearables is beginning to slow down. Now, the company is squarely focused on making its products better after rushing into several new markets. Take something like TensorFlow, one of Google's most important products launched in recent years that most people know nothing about. TensorFlow is an open-source software library for machine learning that Google uses for research and in its own products. It essentially makes it easier for developers to program AI systems. The importance of TensorFlow was cemented in October 2015 when Google announced it was using the system to power RankBrain, an artificial intelligence system built for its core search product. RankBrain was able to beat human experts in identifying the most relevant pages for search results, according to a Bloomberg report. Even though this breakthrough was momentous, it was not celebrated nearly as much as Google's flashier launches for products like Google Home and Daydream VR the following year. It's hard for Google to get consumers excited about announcements like this. There's nothing to hold up and show a crowd, and explaining how neural networks work in laymen's terms is difficult. This is the bleeding-edge of technology being created by some of the smartest minds in America. The only way to really excite consumers is to show them the result of having such artificial intelligence crawl their personal data. This week's keynote at Google I/O simply reiterated that it's hard to get people excited about incremental AI and cloud updates. Google CEO Sundar Pichai essentially acknowledged this in the beginning of his address when he stood in front of a large screen that said, "Mobile first to AI first." He set the tone for big reveals later in the presentation like Google Lens and major updates to Google Home. Both were a huge deal — and just because you can't see them, doesn't mean that they aren't really impressive. Comments Be the first to comment on this story!

The development raises the possibility that Uber may end up dumping Anthony Levandowski, whose expertise in robot-controlled cars is the main reason that the ride-hailing company bought Levandowski's startup for $680 million nine months ago. Until last month, Levandowski had been running Uber's self-driving car division. Although he no longer is doing that, he remains a vital part of Uber's effort to develop a fleet of robot cars so its service eventually will no longer have to rely on people to pick up passengers. Waymo, a self-driving car company started by Google, alleges Levandowski downloaded 14,000 documents containing its trade secrets before he founded the startup that he sold to Uber. Levandowski has asserted his rights under the Fifth Amendment since Waymo filed its lawsuit in February . But Uber is warning Levandowski that he may lose his job unless he waives those rights and reveals whether he took any Waymo documents. The San Francisco company made the threat in a May 15 letter that became public in a court filing late Thursday. Any admission by Levandowski that he possesses the Waymo documents could embroil him in even deeper legal trouble. That's because Waymo's allegations in the civil case have been referred to the U.S. Attorney's office in San Francisco for a potential criminal investigation under an unusual order issued last week by U.S. District Judge William Alsup. Uber had been standing by Levandowski's right use his Fifth Amendment protections until last week when Alsup issued another decision requiring the company to return any documents belonging to Waymo by May 31. Alsup wrote that "in complying with this order, Uber has no excuse under the Fifth Amendment to pull any punches as to Levandowski." Uber alluded to Alsup's stern language in its explaining its change of heart to Levandowski. "While we have respected your personal liberties, it is our view that the court's order requires us to make these demands of you," Uber's general counsel, Salle Yoo, wrote in the letter. Levandowski is fighting back by trying to persuade Alsup to revise his order to protect his Fifth Amendment rights. In a filing, Levandowski's attorneys argued that it's unconstitutional for a judge to strong-arm an employer into pressuring a worker to give up his Fifth Amendment rights to remain on the job. "It is an act by the judicial branch of our federal government compelling an individual to choose between preserving his livelihood and preserving his constitutional rights," Levandowski's lawyers wrote. Waymo's lawsuit already has handcuffed Levandowski. The case prompted Levandowski to temporarily step aside as Uber's top self-driving car executive and avoid working on anything related to lidar, an array of sensors that enables autonomous vehicles to navigate the roads. Alsup has ordered Uber to ensure its work on lidar remains off limits to Levandowski. Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Google Lens, which uses image-recognition technology, was revealed this week by the internet firm’s CEO Sundar Pichai. “Google Lens is a set of vision-based computing capabilities that can understand what you’re looking at and help you take action based on that information,” said Mr Pichai. Users will be able to point their phone’s camera at a shop front or a heritage site and a Google Maps card will pop up on the screen, inviting them to learn more about the area they’re in. When your phone camera is pointed at a shopfront, for example, Google Lens will pull up the name of the store, its rating and other business information. It is understood that the when the technology is used via Google Assistant, your phone’s camera will be able to use the tool to translate languages. Other abilities include shopping suggestions. During a demonstration of the new technology, a phone camera was pointed at a concert venue. A pop-up then displayed on the screen showing upcoming gigs, where to buy tickets, and an option to add a date to your calendar. Google Lens will also allow people to join a wifi network by focusing their phone camera on the router’s log-in information. The tool is being described as having the ability to turn your camera into a “super-intelligent” search engine. No release date has been set but the company said the new tool will be available “in coming months”.

But it seems many other applications may be about to follow in its footsteps. As reported by Android Police, Google has made hiding a store app from rooted devices an official option for developers. Part of the Google Play Console updates announced at I/O 2017 includes the introduction of a device catalog section under the Release management setting. The section allows developers to specify which devices can view their app(s) on the Play Store based on certain criteria, such as performance indicators like RAM that’s under 1Gb and unsupported SoCs. But devices can also be excluded if they don’t pass SafetyNet tests or aren’t certified by Google; i.e. they’re rooted or are running custom ROMs. As is the case with the Netflix app, just because rooted users can’t see the apps in the Play Store doesn’t mean they won’t work on a device. The process is different from the full SafetyNet API implementation used with apps like Android Pay and Pokemon GO, which won’t run unless a phone passes an integrity test when the application launches. If you know what you’re doing and avoid dubious sites, you can always just install the APK from other sources. “SafetyNet Exclusions only restrict the availability of your app from the Play Store. Users can still install your app using the APK file directly,” writes Google. Nevertheless, the new developer feature is likely to annoy a lot of people.

Android O Developer Preview 2 gets a small bump to OPP2.170420.019, partially fixes Android Pay but isn't installing on many Nexus devices Richard Gao Follow View All Posts 2017/05/18 6:32pm PDTMay 18, 2017 39 Plus 1 on G+ 98 Share on Facebook 47 Share on Twitter Total Shares184 Android O Android OS Google News Nexus 5X Nexus 6P Nexus Player Pixel Pixel XL Android O's second developer preview was only released yesterday, but Google has already released an update for it. We're getting bombarded with tips from readers with Nexus and Pixel devices alike. This update reportedly somewhat fixes Android Pay, which did not open at all on yesterday's version. However, it appears that Nexus devices are having trouble updating. This OTA bumps the version number to OPP2.170420.019 and is weighing in at anywhere between 38.8 and 55.9MB, depending on which Google device you have. One tipster informed us that Pay is no longer throwing him an 'unsupported in this build' message and shows him a normal screen with his cards, but hasn't tested whether they're working or not.   A rare, successful install on a Nexus 6P. While the update seems to be installing just fine on Pixel and Pixel XL devices, a majority of owners with Nexus devices appear to be having some trouble. From what we can tell, units of Nexus 5X and 6P smartphones, as well as the Nexus Player, are throwing errors and showing the dead Android logo in recovery. After a hard reboot, the devices are booting up fine, but they remain on yesterday's OPP2.170420.017 build. One user is claiming that Android Pay has begun working for his 6P, despite the install appearing to fail. However, there are users successfully updating their 6Ps to the 0.019 build. (update: It looks like those who flashed the O factory image are updating without issue, while those who took the OTA from Nougat are struggling. This is due to devices that updated from Nougat via OTA retaining the 7.1.2 build fingerprint. Flashing the factory image and then taking the OTA should get the update to work.) Factory image and OTA downloads are not yet available. An official post in the Android Beta Program Google+ page states that the update will hit all devices currently enrolled in the preview within the next few hours, but given the installation failures that Nexus devices are seeing, it's likely to be halted. We'll update this post with more information when we get it.

Dirge Not the ugly, ugly dots! No! Trooper311 Have not noticed that myself. Tiuri Elvander They never appeared for me in the first place. Do you know which apps support them?? Leroy You have to enable the special permissions, under apps& notifications Maxime Labrecque-Raymond Where exactly? do you have a screenshot ? Tiuri Elvander If I go to Settings > Apps & Notifications > App Info, and select Gmail (because it's often shown to support dots in screenshots), Then I go to App notifications and Badge app icon is switched on, yet none appear. Is there a different setting somewhere that I've missed??? Ah, just saw another reply. It's pixel launcher only :( Laraib Zafar Khan Is the notification dot only for pixel launcher? Tr3ple Yes Daniel Grobe I have pixel launcher on my nexus 5x, the dots dont work for me.. nor does the picture in picture. Dirge Installed fine on my Pixel; Won't install on my Nexus Player. vwnut13 Does Hulu open on your Nexus Player? Dirge I don't use Hulu so I don't know. Kyle Anyone having scrambled audio when playing videos? Usually within Facebook or streamable videos. Julian Berger Yes I have it when playing Youtube videos in chrome maestro PL Installed fine on my 6P. Android Pay enabled OkieDokie This small OTA failed to install for me twice (Nexus 6P) 2 Men-E Thanks for the update on the update... My Nexus 6P and I await good news... vwnut13 Had to revert on my Nexus player, as the update broke Hulu. On second thought, wonder if it has anything to do with my unlocked bootloader... Nexus✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Remember folks this software isn't ready for a daily driver yet. They say so themselves. Consider yourself lucky if your using it and they fix stuff like android pay. Also do not forget to unlock your bootloader if you are using the beta. If you do not unlock the bootloader and the beta on your phone goes south you can not use your computer to fix your phone and restore it. Period. The only fix is to send it in. You can re lock the bootloader after the final stable builds are released. Carson Saldanha Wow, thanks for that second part. Didn't think about that. 👍 Dn Bro I disagree with the bootloader thing. I think if they are sending out fixes to Android Pay, they actually want the bootloaders locked. Also, I would say that at the very least, make sure you go into deveopler settings and allow unlocking. That way, you can at least still unlock your phone if it won't boot. Matty032 Is that the USB Debugging option? ZettabyteGamer I'm using it as my daily and while it has only been one day it has been pretty solid for me. It's in beta, I think it is ready for daily driver use for people who are okay with minor hiccups here and there. Martial Clausse I don't think it's ready yet. Lots of apps are crashing, including inbox and Google search... Joshua Lillis The only app that FC on me is Samsung pay, smooth sailing for me. Martial Clausse Out of curiosity, which device are you using ? And did you update through the OTA or flashed the factory image ? Joshua Lillis I have the pixel XL, I enrolled in the beta program and took two ota, one from nougat to o and then the .019 OTA. SomeGuy112 Seems pretty stable on my Pixel XL. The Pixel performance lead at Google said the Beta is pretty stable on Twitter recently but maybe that's only for the Pixel version. https://mobile.twitter.com/t_murray/status/864927591274127360 Laraib Zafar Khan Apple music is FC too BrandoHD This information isn't correct, you can flash official factory images with a locked bootloader ZettabyteGamer I hope you didn't mean to reply to me, because I never said anything about a bootloader. Joshua Lillis I think he meant to reply to Nexus 2 Men-E I don't use Android Pay, but I do notice the signal will drop for extensive periods of time on my Nexus 6P... Most stuff is running "okay", though... LALO Everything works fine on my Google Pixel. Surprisingly no apps have crashed since I updated. blackeyeX2 On my 6P, I have had more FC's and freezing than I did on the Alpha preview. boop Looks like it comes with the new Assistant features (or maybe I just got them at the same time). Dirge You got them the same time. It is a server side switch. . Carlos Rodríguez The OTA fails because the recovery has an old build fingerprint from 7.1.2, so the installer fails. You can try to install the OTA many times and it will fail. When you get the error, press Power + Volume Up to see the actual error, then you can safely reboot from there. The solution is to sideload the full DP2 OTA from here (https://developer.android.com/preview/download-ota.html ) or the factory image from here (https://developer.android.com/preview/download.html ) and then you can install the small OTA. Cheers! Peter Good work sir. Thanks for the info. Richard Gao Thanks for letting us know. I've added this to the post. Mike Arnett Stupid question: the OTA on my phone to this was 55mb, but the OTA package is 1GB. Is this the full image, and will it wipe all my data? Carlos Rodríguez The full OTA shouldn't wipe the device, make a backup just in case. blackeyeX2 The 55mb one was an update to the full (1GB) released yesterday. bobfrealy Per Carlos R.'s suggestion, after having registered for beta, taking 017 ota, failing with E3001 error on 019 ota, I downloaded and sideloaded the 017 ota. now the 019 system update notification is nowhere to be found. any idea on how to get that back? just wait? meanwhile recover still shows 7.1.2, and Android Pay seems to be running fine. Carlos Rodríguez After some minutes the update should show up. Check for updates. It eventually appeared for me the 3 times it failed to install. bobfrealy yep, it showed back up. and still failed (that's why i mentioned my recovery version, most likely the issue). will likely have to do full image. better to have a full clean install, just a pain with much setup to do afterward. blackeyeX2 Google Pay. My update failed, but Android Pay is now working anyways. Zikaeroh This didn't work for me. After sideloading the update and trying to install the OTA, I get the same error. I'd simply flash just the recovery image from the factory image, but I'm not OEM unlocked. :( Carlos Rodríguez Indeed. The only solution is to unlock the bootloader and flash the DP2 recovery. I guess we're screwed until google does something.

Basically i profit almost $80/hourly and work for 3 to 4 h everyday.And superb point regarding this work is that you can actually decide when to work yourself as well as for how long and you are compensated at the end of each week.>>>> learn by clicking here how to do it right now Flint_PS 017 OTA sideload doesn't work, I got the error again Fernando Pena So, I decided to start from scratch and flashed the factory image, following updating the .19 OTA. Everything went just fine and I was able to boot the device and restore my backup. Then I started to install/update my apps and noticed that Google App isn't updating, the app keeps refusing to update even downloading the latest APK from apkmirror. It's currently stuck at version 6.16 and this sucks because assistant is not working. Play store doesn't show any updates even if I apply for Google app beta. I don't know what to do, I would appreciate some help... blackeyeX2 The updated images ending 19 are not available yet, the ones posted are still 17. So OTA is only option for now. JC I was getting the same error. It never successfully installed on my nexus 5x. Dn Bro So I did the OTA yesterday on my Nexus 6P, got the Android Pay is unsupported, as was the case. Today, tried this update, it failed, but now when I open the android pay it shows my cards like normal. Not sure if they work, but there you go. Nate Hallett I'm still on the .017 build from yesterday on my Pixel XL, I took the beta OTA and have opened & used Android Pay without a problem. I don't understand why so many people don't have Android Pay enabled on yesterday's build, even with the N Preview they enabled Android Pay so why would it be different this time around? I'm currently waiting for the .019 OTA to finish installing, I'll update my comment with the results. nxtiak I'm on 017 on my XL and I just opened Android Pay and it said it's not enabled in this preview. Installing 019 now. lomsha It's only toward the end that pay was enabled on n previews, not from the start. Frisi Started installing on my Pixel XL. After step 1 was done, it restarted. Still on .017. Thing is, it started step 2 but it hangs here. Andeoid Pay now works, though. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/721d0f338ee7cfe4ff4a19f06d55c9318dd4fa5e7be02f24d9f4befb5eff7b14.png Frisi Well, it started moving after I posted this. I don't know what's causing it to take that long. daburghit It failed for me on a Nexus 5X but I can secondarily confirm that Android Pay works post-failure on the 17 build. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/7c5c1a621e6af03a2092437d0a84552a7cb821509966e5f48c9bdb8ce2a19af5.png Anthony Castanza Android Pay started loading again for me *without* installing this update. It appears to be a server side fix and not directly related to this build. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/bca05de36f641e9afb90773dd4129e37cd5eee46791485bab34ec82e2c423f39.png Chris Thurber Same for me as well except on a 6P! JeffCO Just updated on the XL and Android Pay which was not working earlier now comes up. Haven't tried to use it. Bizziet I was hoping it fixed the now broken MMS issue in messages! Try to add a picture and the whole messages app freezes. Pixel XL on T-mobile. ZettabyteGamer Just updated my XL and when I go to add a new card to Android Pay I get "Android Pay can't be used on this device" So it isnt fixed for me atleast. Lucas Araujo It seems that the update has been pulled. My N5X had the same problem while applying the update and it is not showing in the updates anymore. My Android version still at *.017. Also, after update failure, my google photos app lost its icon and ir showing a generic Android Robot icon. bobfrealy My Photos app icon had this problem immediately after taking 017 ota. reboot; clear cache; etc, re-install app, nothing restored icon. :( doesn't matter now as i'm likely full 017 flashing. blackeyeX2 I disabled the app (which then uninstalled app to original version), then it updated and Icon is back to normal!! Just wiping the cache will not work. blackeyeX2 It's not pulled. It will show up again in your notifications in 30 min, or so. I've tried it a couple of times and each time it reappears after some time. JohnyNoLegs Quality google. Brian Sandoval Not sure if anyone had this issue after update on 6P? I have a hidden network for my wifi and device once updated will no longer connect to it. Ján “Johnny” Valentík This new build fixed for me Google Play Music inside Android Auto on my Pixel XL. In 0.17 I couldn't play any music nor the widget with controls would show... Mattsus The OTA update worked for me this morning(UK time), this is coming directly from an OTA update from Nougat to O Dev Preview 2, can confirm Android Pay now works. neon tiger Have you tried actually using it or just opening the app ? Mattsus I've tried both opening the app, adding new card details as old one expired yesterday, and using it against several terminals. Can confirm no issues thus far. Before update, opening the app wouldn't work but was able to pay using it no problem at all. Joshua Lillis I guess I'm lucky, took the beta OTA from 7.1.2, and now took the .019 OTA just fine. Couldn't flash a factory image if I wanted to, damn Verizon. mieszk3 Nexus 5X 019 OTA: https://android.googleapis.com/packages/ota-api/google_bullhead_bullhead/44bdd4f9967717bad5ef82a54c1dbf2c1ba92fa1.zip Rowan I tried to install it today on my Nexus 6p and a error message came up. I thought it was about to start boot looping but it turned on minutes later to my releif Besnik Rrustemi It worked for me on my Nexus 6P. But maybe it is because i was on 7.1.2 and updated to DP2 the moment they announced it on live Google I/O (0.17 build) and after the first update the 0.19 installed without problem, So maybe the issue is updating directly from 7.1.2 to DP2 0.19 ? jon Hutchinson The update failed on my Nexus 6p. Though android pay began to work. Double edge sword though I'm glad my android pay is restored. I'm still on 0.17. Updated over OTA and even for a factory reset while on Android o. iftekhar bongo my nexus 5x showing error while installing upate... any solution? Leroy This latest build seems to cause problems with safetynet. Stock phones are registered as 'uncertified' in the play store and Android pay doesn't work because the devices are rooted, only they're not.. Small OTA received over the beta factory images on 5X.. Device is marked as uncertified now lol https://www.reddit.com/r/AndroidPreviews/comments/6c0bsg/small_ota_received_over_the_beta_factory_images/ neon tiger Yeah my banking app won't let me use fingerprint login because of this. Leroy Yeah it's really annoying. Hopefully they can fix it on their end without. Would be a shame is we have to reflash 017 build or wait for next OTA to fix it. compuguy1088 Same here on the PixelXL. I'm sure they will update SafetyNet soon enough to fix this. wickets So, next question....when are they fixing PIP?? :) Ernie My Nexus 6p also got an error trying to update from . 17 to. 19 as well. Cache wipe didn't solve the problem either. Any other tricks? Alex Kruger I installed the update via OTA on my Pixel XL, now I can open Android Pay, but I can't add any cards because it thinks my bootloader is unlocked. It's not, I've done everything through the official OTA channel. nextelnutt I received the update and got the dead Android error. However, my build number did indicate .019, then 25 minutes ago, I noticed the update was available again for my 6P. So I downloaded and installed again and device restarted fine. As for Android Pay, I will try it when I am out shopping today. Robert Macdonald Play store now showing as uncertified, Android pay loads but says cannot be used. Otherwise it installed just fine on my pixel. Andreas Constantinides 6p here, got the issue. JoeInMO On my Pixel XL I get "Android Pay can't be used on this device." I'm not rooted or bootloader unlocked. I never had Pay set up before. Matty032 I have the same error. Maxime Labrecque-Raymond Got the issue and my DOTs dosen't work Nexus 6P blacleyeX2 The OTA Nexus 6P failed, but I can confirm that Android Pay is now working and I have used it for a transaction. Not sure how that worked, any ideas? Marty Got the error. 6P. blacleyeX2 The available images are only for the images ending 17 and not the new 19, so we can't side load yet. mieszk3 All of you with unlocked bootloader -> manually flash via fastboot: bootloader, boot, radio and recovery and then 019 OTA will work. (Probably only bootloader is necessary). Marty Firmware not available yet. mieszk3 Use 017 version, then sideload 019 OTA Marty "Factory image and OTA downloads are not yet available." mieszk3 Nexus 5X 017->019 OTA: https://disq.us/url?url=https%3A%2F%2Fandroid.googleapis.com%2Fpackages%2Fota-api%2Fgoogle_bullhead_bullhead%2F44bdd4f9967717bad5ef82a54c1dbf2c1ba92fa1.zip%3AgIXISwZNuhjf2FlMgjO4Va15Lr0&cuid=1370072 Firmwares: https://developer.android.com/preview/download.html Marty I was just contrasting what you said with what the article said. I'm not desperate to update my 6P. I don't use it anymore. Ultra Sage My nexus 5x worked fine for the first few hours. Then when this update came out, I tried installing it but my phone kept on crashing and restarting after every few minutes. It was not bootloop since I could receive calls, but if I opened anything else, then it would crash and restart. I finally managed to use terminal to unlock the boot loader and restore nougat factory image, since the OTA download would stall the screen, and it would restart. I was a beta tester for Nougat, but this was a bad experience. Kris Fannin Same issue with my Nexus 6P. Update fails. Just another data point for you and thanks for the information. ctk4949 I was about to switch back to my Pixel XL from my S8+. But when I tried connecting my Gear S3 watch, it wouldn't open the app. It force closes each time. :( Matt McNair After the update Android Pay will launch but I just tried to pay with it and I get a message stating that my Pixel XL isn't eligible. Had to pull out the ole wallet. StW I tried to apply this update twice on my Nexus 6P but each time the updated failed near the beginning of the install. However, yesterday Android Pay was not working (unsupported developer version message) but today, even though the install failed, Android Pay works. Cael Android Pay works on my Pixel XL after receiving this update. Ernie I think Google might have pulled the . 19 update for the Nexus 6p. I haven't gotten a notification for the update for almost 2 hours now. EnerJi I still have a notification pending on my Nexus 5X. I wonder if that means it's been fixed on the 5X? I've been holding off on trying it until I see some folks confirm that it works for people who OTAd from 7.1.2. Matty032 At first I got the root error with Android pay. But, I cleared cache and then restarted the phone. I was then able to complete the transaction. Works now. That's after Google Chat Support told me it wouldn't work with O. LOL Ian Kumlien 019 ota is up and will apply on a 017 Android O OTA (as in N -> O) phone via ADB sideload Guilherme Noronha Just got the update notification again after failing​ to install this morning.

It installed successfully and build number went up to .019 OkieDokie Awesome news.

Google helps software creators answer. by Mark Bergen @mhbergen More stories by Mark Bergen May 19, 2017, 7:05 PM EDT Google gave away thousands of Home devices to developers at its 2017 I/O conference Photographer: Alistair Barr, Bloomberg News/Bloomberg Here is Google's vision for the future of computing: As you drive home from work, you tell your car, "Ok, Google," triggering the company's Assistant. You order food, the digital helper handles the transaction and makes sure it's ready when you arrive. Right now, Amazon.com Inc. and its Alexa digital assistant are closer to realizing that goal, having cut a deal this year with Ford Motor Co. to let drivers search, shop and control other devices by voice from their vehicles. That's just one of the ways Amazon is outpacing Google in the race to weave a digital assistant into consumers' lives. What's more, Amazon has a leading e-commerce business well suited to this emerging world, with a massive delivery network to speed orders to shoppers -- an area where Google has struggled. Amazon's Echo connected speakers, launched in 2014, have given Alexa an early lead by reaching millions of users at home, while Google's rival Home device only came out late last year.  “Amazon kind of fell into this lead in 2014 because it wanted to sell more things to people in new ways," said Brian Roemmele, founder of ReadMultiplex.com, a website about voice-based commerce and computing. "Google is trying to evolve its online search experience into devices that have a voice. That philosophy limits its ability to really go after Amazon.” Central to Alexa's appeal: Amazon has thousands of voice-based apps up and running, far out-numbering Google's tally. The Alphabet Inc. unit used its I/O developer conference this week to try to narrow Amazon's lead by wooing skilled programmers capable of building tools and services that can make the Google Assistant more useful. The company stressed experience with mobile software and the millions of things it already understands on the web and in the real world. Vehicle and payment functions were rolled out to expand the Assistant beyond the more simple ways people use it now, such as setting alarms and playing music.  "A lot of what you need to get done is transactional," said Gummi Hafsteinsson, product director for the Assistant. "We take care of all the nitty-gritty hard parts." Technology giants think voice-based computing could be the next big platform, after mobile. The company that wins will have the most users talking to devices and the most developers creating new experiences. Google’s Assistant has only been active for six months. That’s a major disadvantage when it comes to creating that virtuous circle of users and developers.  It tried to get that circle spinning faster at I/O. About 7,000 conference attendees were offered a free Google Home speaker and $700 worth of credits for its cloud-computing service. The company is hoping these developers will use both to build and test new voice-based apps (known as Actions on Google) for the company’s Assistant.  It needs to fire up these developers, many of whom have already been building for Amazon's Alexa system. By February, there were 10,000 Alexa Skills -- the equivalent of an app for Amazon's voice-based system -- up from 1,000 in June 2016. Bloomberg News counted fewer than 300 Actions for Google’s Assistant built by outside developers on Friday afternoon. Last June, the voice-based technology wasn't available publicly yet. Neither company is anywhere close to the dream of a naturally conversant machine. But Google is leaning on its expertise in artificial intelligence fields like voice recognition and automated language understanding to push it ahead if or when this form of human-computer interaction takes off. It also hopes long experience collecting and organizing information from the web will provide a useful fallback solution when the company’s Assistant lacks a specific Action to address user questions. Take cooking recipes, an early use for hands-free speakers. By November, Alexa could talk budding home chefs through more than 60,000 recipes. That came from a Skills integration with the cooking app Allrecipes. The latest Echo Look device, with a screen, is particularly well suited to voice-based kitchen use because it can show people recipes, as well as tell them about ingredients and cooking steps. Bloomberg News asked Google’s Assistant to talk to Allrecipes on Friday afternoon, and the digital helper sent web links rather than an integrated voice-based Action. However, the Assistant has access to 45,000 recipe websites that have already been marked up with special code that lets Google’s software read out ingredients and other related information, Hafsteinsson said. "Google has better understanding. It has been working on AI much longer,"said Patricia Carando, a mobile developer attending the I/O conference. She's been working on an Alexa Skill, but she was learning how to create an Action for Google's Assistant during coding classes at the event on Thursday. Eventually, consumers will pick one digital assistant "and stick with it," pushing developers to mostly build on that platform, she added.  A deep concern for Google is that more people will stick with Amazon or a potential device from other competitors like Apple Inc. That's behind Google's rush to integrate its Assistant with any and all connected devices. At I/O, Google executives unveiled Home Graph, a system for connecting and controlling smart home devices by speaking to the Assistant. There are about 70 outside companies working with Google to sync things like dishwashers, fridges and light bulbs to the voice-based platform, including GE Appliances, Osram Lighting and Leviton, the internet giant said. Even so, Amazon is making the most of its earlier start. The day before I/O began, a new Amazon program emerged for outside developers working with the company’s Alexa digital assistant, which controls its Echo devices and a rising number of other gadgets. If users talk a lot to a developer’s Alexa Skill, then Amazon will send a reward of cold hard cash, according to note posted Amazon’s Alexa developer website. On Amazon’s website, there are hundreds of home devices already for sale that work with Alexa, made by roughly 30 companies such as Samsung Electronics Co., Philips and Wink. Google is taking pains to show how easy it is to use its tools. During an I/O demo in front of a packed crowd of developers on Thursday, a Google engineer built a simple Action for the Assistant that turned on a set of virtual light bulbs, then turned them green, by voice. The company is working on “What it means to be a washing machine,” the engineer said, to giggles from some in the audience. Exclusive insights on technology around the world. Get Fully Charged, from Bloomberg Technology. Sign Up Google is also working on what it means to be an assistant. Organizing web information and supporting apps is familiar terrain. Discerning what consumers want to hear from their voice-based devices is new territory. At an another panel during the week, Google engineers showed developers a list of criteria the company uses to decide what Actions and other data to surface within its new Assistant world. Those included questions about whether end users had to repeat requests, learned something or "LOL" (laughed out loud). The company rarely exposes such specific guidelines. It's famously secretive about these types of criteria when it comes to search results, to avoid website developers gaming the system and ruining the experience. The fact that it's being so open, shows how eager it is to lure a new army of outside voice-based developers. "Please, please think about those things," Valerie Nygaard, a Google product manager, told the audience. "These are the questions we ask ourselves." Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

But smack between these two was news about updates to Android TV, the space where many of Google's recent efforts overlap. One of the big changes Android TV users will see in the coming months is Android O arriving on their devices. The new TV homescreen for O moves six content shortcuts to the top, which users can edit and reorder. This is where you'd put the Netflix or YouTube app. The rest of the page is given over to new channels provided by content producers. Netflix, for example, can put a sample of its offerings in a horizontal scrolling bar. Providers can also create specific channels. In a hands-on demo with Android O, I saw both a YouTube channel and a separate channel for trending content on YouTube. Content providers create the channels, but users can edit which ones appear on their homescreens and the order in which they appear. A new onboarding experience will give users a chance to choose some channels, such as business or technology news. Android TV O can also detect if you have content apps installed on your phone, and will automatically add those to the homescreen. Videos on Android TV will also have auto-playing previews in Android O. As you highlight the static images displaying different shows, they begin to play after a short delay. It's certainly engaging, but personally I was turned off by the idea of auto-playing anything. Oh Hey, Google This year, Google announced that the Google Assistant will be coming to even more platforms - including iPhones. But Android TV will also be playing host to Google's Alexa competitor. It will also be a wide rollout, coming to Android TV devices running Marshmallow, Nougat, and O. The Assistant will also be available on skinned Android TV devices, like the Nvidia Shield streaming box and even branded cable boxes from cable providers. On TV, Google Assistant will function much the same as Alexa and Siri on their respective streaming boxes. You can ask it to play movies, perform searches, and so on. The Assistant does bring some more subtle tricks to the TV, however. For example, you can continue to have a conversation with the Assistant, and reference previous results. You can ask "What is Stranger Things" and see a card talking about the hit Netflix show. You can follow that up with a second question asking "how many episodes is it?" The Assistant understands that by "it" you mean Stranger Things and it will display the answer. All of this is done on-screen, even while other video content is playing. I have an Apple TV at home, and I've been surprised at how much more capable Siri on the iPhone is compared to its TV counterpart. The Google Assistant on Android TV, on the other hand, seems to be as capable as ever. You can ask the Assistant how long it will take to get to work while you're watching Netflix, and a card will appear on the bottom third of the screen with the relevant information. This last point was briefly touched on during the Google I/O keynote presentation. The Google Assistant and the Google Home will soon be taking advantage of nearby screens to present relevant information in response to voice queries. It could push driving directions to your phone or display a weather report on a Chromecast connected TV, for example. This year's Google I/O was very much centered around the idea of Google being an "AI first" company. Putting the Google Assistant into the company's big-screen experience is definitely a step in that direction, but whether people will change their habits, asking questions about the weather or stocks to a TV, remains to be seen.

If your Home isn’t in a place where you can see the LEDs, you won’t have any clue that the device didn’t hear you. Thankfully, there’s a way to fix that. The best gifts for Android users In Google Home’s settings, you can enable an accessibility feature which allows your Google Home unit to emit a sound anytime the device hears you, as well as after it registers a command and pushes the information. For me personally, this is something I’ve been missing since switching from the Amazon Echo. Apparently, this option has been available since Google released Home, but it’s buried pretty deep in the settings. How to enable audible feedback for Google Home commands: Open the Google Home app on Android or iOS Tap the “Devices” option at the top of the app Scroll and find your Google Home Select the overflow option and access Settings Scroll to Accessibility Toggle sounds for Start of Request and End of Request based on your personal preferences Learn More about Google Home: Google Home Review How to link your Netflix, Spotify, and Pandora accounts with Google Home How to cast audio from your Android device to Google Home These are the smart home products I’m using with Google Home Google Home finally adds multi-user support to deliver personalized Assistant results Google Home/Assistant adds support for more home automation products from TP-Link, LIFX, August and 10 others This 3D-printed mount makes it easy to put Google Home on your wall [Gallery] Ben Schoon @NexusBen Ben is a writer for 9to5Google who can also be found over on the 9to5Google YouTube channel and on Twitter @NexusBen.

The question was passed over to Dave Burke, Android’s VP of Engineering, who stated that Fuchsia was being developed independently from Android… UAG Samsung Galaxy S8 CasesIn his response, Burke said that Fuchsia is an “early-stage experimental project,” along with an unknown number of other projects. What is different, though, is that Fuchsia is open source which allows outsiders to see the code and contribute to it. Having the code in hand is how we were able to go hands-on with an early build of Fuchsia. Below is the transcript of Burke’s response from the below video: How do you spell Fuchsia? Fuchsia is a early-stage experimental project. We, you know, we actually have lots of cool early projects at Google. I think what’s interesting here is it’s open source, so people can see it and comment on it. Like lots of early stage projects it’s gonna probably pivot and morph. There’s some really smart people on it, people we’ve worked with who are great. And so it’s kind of exciting to see what happens. But it’s definitely a different sort of independent project to android. And yeah, that’s basically it. The takeaway message here is that Fuchsia is a project that is still in its early stages and is not being developed alongside Android. Burke didn’t share any specifics about what Fuchsia will do in the future, but he did say that it will “probably pivot and morph.” We’ll just have to wait and see what Google decides to do with Fuchsia, if anything at all.

Android O Developer Preview 2 gets a small bump to OPP2.170420.019, partially fixes Android Pay but isn't installing on many Nexus devices Richard Gao Follow View All Posts 2017/05/18 6:32pm PDTMay 18, 2017 39 Plus 1 on G+ 98 Share on Facebook 47 Share on Twitter Total Shares184 Android O Android OS Google News Nexus 5X Nexus 6P Nexus Player Pixel Pixel XL Android O's second developer preview was only released yesterday, but Google has already released an update for it. We're getting bombarded with tips from readers with Nexus and Pixel devices alike. This update reportedly somewhat fixes Android Pay, which did not open at all on yesterday's version. However, it appears that Nexus devices are having trouble updating. This OTA bumps the version number to OPP2.170420.019 and is weighing in at anywhere between 38.8 and 55.9MB, depending on which Google device you have. One tipster informed us that Pay is no longer throwing him an 'unsupported in this build' message and shows him a normal screen with his cards, but hasn't tested whether they're working or not.   A rare, successful install on a Nexus 6P. While the update seems to be installing just fine on Pixel and Pixel XL devices, a majority of owners with Nexus devices appear to be having some trouble. From what we can tell, units of Nexus 5X and 6P smartphones, as well as the Nexus Player, are throwing errors and showing the dead Android logo in recovery. After a hard reboot, the devices are booting up fine, but they remain on yesterday's OPP2.170420.017 build. One user is claiming that Android Pay has begun working for his 6P, despite the install appearing to fail. However, there are users successfully updating their 6Ps to the 0.019 build. (update: It looks like those who flashed the O factory image are updating without issue, while those who took the OTA from Nougat are struggling. This is due to devices that updated from Nougat via OTA retaining the 7.1.2 build fingerprint. Flashing the factory image and then taking the OTA should get the update to work.) Factory image and OTA downloads are not yet available. An official post in the Android Beta Program Google+ page states that the update will hit all devices currently enrolled in the preview within the next few hours, but given the installation failures that Nexus devices are seeing, it's likely to be halted. We'll update this post with more information when we get it.

Dirge Not the ugly, ugly dots! No! Trooper311 Have not noticed that myself. Tiuri Elvander They never appeared for me in the first place. Do you know which apps support them?? Leroy You have to enable the special permissions, under apps& notifications Maxime Labrecque-Raymond Where exactly? do you have a screenshot ? Tiuri Elvander If I go to Settings > Apps & Notifications > App Info, and select Gmail (because it's often shown to support dots in screenshots), Then I go to App notifications and Badge app icon is switched on, yet none appear. Is there a different setting somewhere that I've missed??? Ah, just saw another reply. It's pixel launcher only :( Laraib Zafar Khan Is the notification dot only for pixel launcher? Tr3ple Yes Daniel Grobe I have pixel launcher on my nexus 5x, the dots dont work for me.. nor does the picture in picture. Dirge Installed fine on my Pixel; Won't install on my Nexus Player. vwnut13 Does Hulu open on your Nexus Player? Dirge I don't use Hulu so I don't know. Kyle Anyone having scrambled audio when playing videos? Usually within Facebook or streamable videos. Julian Berger Yes I have it when playing Youtube videos in chrome maestro PL Installed fine on my 6P. Android Pay enabled OkieDokie This small OTA failed to install for me twice (Nexus 6P) 2 Men-E Thanks for the update on the update... My Nexus 6P and I await good news... vwnut13 Had to revert on my Nexus player, as the update broke Hulu. On second thought, wonder if it has anything to do with my unlocked bootloader... Nexus✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Remember folks this software isn't ready for a daily driver yet. They say so themselves. Consider yourself lucky if your using it and they fix stuff like android pay. Also do not forget to unlock your bootloader if you are using the beta. If you do not unlock the bootloader and the beta on your phone goes south you can not use your computer to fix your phone and restore it. Period. The only fix is to send it in. You can re lock the bootloader after the final stable builds are released. Carson Saldanha Wow, thanks for that second part. Didn't think about that. 👍 Dn Bro I disagree with the bootloader thing. I think if they are sending out fixes to Android Pay, they actually want the bootloaders locked. Also, I would say that at the very least, make sure you go into deveopler settings and allow unlocking. That way, you can at least still unlock your phone if it won't boot. Matty032 Is that the USB Debugging option? ZettabyteGamer I'm using it as my daily and while it has only been one day it has been pretty solid for me. It's in beta, I think it is ready for daily driver use for people who are okay with minor hiccups here and there. Martial Clausse I don't think it's ready yet. Lots of apps are crashing, including inbox and Google search... Joshua Lillis The only app that FC on me is Samsung pay, smooth sailing for me. Martial Clausse Out of curiosity, which device are you using ? And did you update through the OTA or flashed the factory image ? Joshua Lillis I have the pixel XL, I enrolled in the beta program and took two ota, one from nougat to o and then the .019 OTA. SomeGuy112 Seems pretty stable on my Pixel XL. The Pixel performance lead at Google said the Beta is pretty stable on Twitter recently but maybe that's only for the Pixel version. https://mobile.twitter.com/t_murray/status/864927591274127360 Laraib Zafar Khan Apple music is FC too BrandoHD This information isn't correct, you can flash official factory images with a locked bootloader ZettabyteGamer I hope you didn't mean to reply to me, because I never said anything about a bootloader. Joshua Lillis I think he meant to reply to Nexus 2 Men-E I don't use Android Pay, but I do notice the signal will drop for extensive periods of time on my Nexus 6P... Most stuff is running "okay", though... LALO Everything works fine on my Google Pixel. Surprisingly no apps have crashed since I updated. blackeyeX2 On my 6P, I have had more FC's and freezing than I did on the Alpha preview. boop Looks like it comes with the new Assistant features (or maybe I just got them at the same time). Dirge You got them the same time. It is a server side switch. . Carlos Rodríguez The OTA fails because the recovery has an old build fingerprint from 7.1.2, so the installer fails. You can try to install the OTA many times and it will fail. When you get the error, press Power + Volume Up to see the actual error, then you can safely reboot from there. The solution is to sideload the full DP2 OTA from here (https://developer.android.com/preview/download-ota.html ) or the factory image from here (https://developer.android.com/preview/download.html ) and then you can install the small OTA. Cheers! Peter Good work sir. Thanks for the info. Richard Gao Thanks for letting us know. I've added this to the post. Mike Arnett Stupid question: the OTA on my phone to this was 55mb, but the OTA package is 1GB. Is this the full image, and will it wipe all my data? Carlos Rodríguez The full OTA shouldn't wipe the device, make a backup just in case. blackeyeX2 The 55mb one was an update to the full (1GB) released yesterday. bobfrealy Per Carlos R.'s suggestion, after having registered for beta, taking 017 ota, failing with E3001 error on 019 ota, I downloaded and sideloaded the 017 ota. now the 019 system update notification is nowhere to be found. any idea on how to get that back? just wait? meanwhile recover still shows 7.1.2, and Android Pay seems to be running fine. Carlos Rodríguez After some minutes the update should show up. Check for updates. It eventually appeared for me the 3 times it failed to install. bobfrealy yep, it showed back up. and still failed (that's why i mentioned my recovery version, most likely the issue). will likely have to do full image. better to have a full clean install, just a pain with much setup to do afterward. blackeyeX2 Google Pay. My update failed, but Android Pay is now working anyways. Zikaeroh This didn't work for me. After sideloading the update and trying to install the OTA, I get the same error. I'd simply flash just the recovery image from the factory image, but I'm not OEM unlocked. :( Carlos Rodríguez Indeed. The only solution is to unlock the bootloader and flash the DP2 recovery. I guess we're screwed until google does something. Paige Turner I'am freelancing using the web, performing basic jobs that requires from you personal pc or alternatively laptop and additionally internet service access and so I couldn't be more satisfied... 6 months have passed by when i started off this and also i profited up to now overall 36,000 dollars... Basically i profit almost $80/hourly and work for 3 to 4 h everyday.And superb point regarding this work is that you can actually decide when to work yourself as well as for how long and you are compensated at the end of each week.>>>> learn by clicking here how to do it right now Flint_PS 017 OTA sideload doesn't work, I got the error again Fernando Pena So, I decided to start from scratch and flashed the factory image, following updating the .19 OTA. Everything went just fine and I was able to boot the device and restore my backup. Then I started to install/update my apps and noticed that Google App isn't updating, the app keeps refusing to update even downloading the latest APK from apkmirror. It's currently stuck at version 6.16 and this sucks because assistant is not working. Play store doesn't show any updates even if I apply for Google app beta. I don't know what to do, I would appreciate some help... blackeyeX2 The updated images ending 19 are not available yet, the ones posted are still 17. So OTA is only option for now. JC I was getting the same error. It never successfully installed on my nexus 5x. Dn Bro So I did the OTA yesterday on my Nexus 6P, got the Android Pay is unsupported, as was the case. Today, tried this update, it failed, but now when I open the android pay it shows my cards like normal. Not sure if they work, but there you go. Nate Hallett I'm still on the .017 build from yesterday on my Pixel XL, I took the beta OTA and have opened & used Android Pay without a problem. I don't understand why so many people don't have Android Pay enabled on yesterday's build, even with the N Preview they enabled Android Pay so why would it be different this time around? I'm currently waiting for the .019 OTA to finish installing, I'll update my comment with the results. nxtiak I'm on 017 on my XL and I just opened Android Pay and it said it's not enabled in this preview. Installing 019 now. lomsha It's only toward the end that pay was enabled on n previews, not from the start. Frisi Started installing on my Pixel XL. After step 1 was done, it restarted. Still on .017. Thing is, it started step 2 but it hangs here. Andeoid Pay now works, though. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/721d0f338ee7cfe4ff4a19f06d55c9318dd4fa5e7be02f24d9f4befb5eff7b14.png Frisi Well, it started moving after I posted this. I don't know what's causing it to take that long. daburghit It failed for me on a Nexus 5X but I can secondarily confirm that Android Pay works post-failure on the 17 build. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/7c5c1a621e6af03a2092437d0a84552a7cb821509966e5f48c9bdb8ce2a19af5.png Anthony Castanza Android Pay started loading again for me *without* installing this update. It appears to be a server side fix and not directly related to this build. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/bca05de36f641e9afb90773dd4129e37cd5eee46791485bab34ec82e2c423f39.png Chris Thurber Same for me as well except on a 6P! JeffCO Just updated on the XL and Android Pay which was not working earlier now comes up. Haven't tried to use it. Bizziet I was hoping it fixed the now broken MMS issue in messages! Try to add a picture and the whole messages app freezes. Pixel XL on T-mobile. ZettabyteGamer Just updated my XL and when I go to add a new card to Android Pay I get "Android Pay can't be used on this device" So it isnt fixed for me atleast. Lucas Araujo It seems that the update has been pulled. My N5X had the same problem while applying the update and it is not showing in the updates anymore. My Android version still at *.017. Also, after update failure, my google photos app lost its icon and ir showing a generic Android Robot icon. bobfrealy My Photos app icon had this problem immediately after taking 017 ota. reboot; clear cache; etc, re-install app, nothing restored icon. :( doesn't matter now as i'm likely full 017 flashing. blackeyeX2 I disabled the app (which then uninstalled app to original version), then it updated and Icon is back to normal!! Just wiping the cache will not work. blackeyeX2 It's not pulled. It will show up again in your notifications in 30 min, or so. I've tried it a couple of times and each time it reappears after some time. JohnyNoLegs Quality google. Brian Sandoval Not sure if anyone had this issue after update on 6P? I have a hidden network for my wifi and device once updated will no longer connect to it. Ján “Johnny” Valentík This new build fixed for me Google Play Music inside Android Auto on my Pixel XL. In 0.17 I couldn't play any music nor the widget with controls would show... Mattsus The OTA update worked for me this morning(UK time), this is coming directly from an OTA update from Nougat to O Dev Preview 2, can confirm Android Pay now works. neon tiger Have you tried actually using it or just opening the app ? Mattsus I've tried both opening the app, adding new card details as old one expired yesterday, and using it against several terminals. Can confirm no issues thus far. Before update, opening the app wouldn't work but was able to pay using it no problem at all. Joshua Lillis I guess I'm lucky, took the beta OTA from 7.1.2, and now took the .019 OTA just fine. Couldn't flash a factory image if I wanted to, damn Verizon. mieszk3 Nexus 5X 019 OTA: https://android.googleapis.com/packages/ota-api/google_bullhead_bullhead/44bdd4f9967717bad5ef82a54c1dbf2c1ba92fa1.zip Rowan I tried to install it today on my Nexus 6p and a error message came up. I thought it was about to start boot looping but it turned on minutes later to my releif Besnik Rrustemi It worked for me on my Nexus 6P. But maybe it is because i was on 7.1.2 and updated to DP2 the moment they announced it on live Google I/O (0.17 build) and after the first update the 0.19 installed without problem, So maybe the issue is updating directly from 7.1.2 to DP2 0.19 ? jon Hutchinson The update failed on my Nexus 6p. Though android pay began to work. Double edge sword though I'm glad my android pay is restored. I'm still on 0.17. Updated over OTA and even for a factory reset while on Android o. iftekhar bongo my nexus 5x showing error while installing upate... any solution? Leroy This latest build seems to cause problems with safetynet. Stock phones are registered as 'uncertified' in the play store and Android pay doesn't work because the devices are rooted, only they're not.. Small OTA received over the beta factory images on 5X.. Device is marked as uncertified now lol https://www.reddit.com/r/AndroidPreviews/comments/6c0bsg/small_ota_received_over_the_beta_factory_images/ neon tiger Yeah my banking app won't let me use fingerprint login because of this. Leroy Yeah it's really annoying. Hopefully they can fix it on their end without. Would be a shame is we have to reflash 017 build or wait for next OTA to fix it. compuguy1088 Same here on the PixelXL. I'm sure they will update SafetyNet soon enough to fix this. wickets So, next question....when are they fixing PIP?? :) Ernie My Nexus 6p also got an error trying to update from . 17 to. 19 as well. Cache wipe didn't solve the problem either. Any other tricks? Alex Kruger I installed the update via OTA on my Pixel XL, now I can open Android Pay, but I can't add any cards because it thinks my bootloader is unlocked. It's not, I've done everything through the official OTA channel. nextelnutt I received the update and got the dead Android error. However, my build number did indicate .019, then 25 minutes ago, I noticed the update was available again for my 6P. So I downloaded and installed again and device restarted fine. As for Android Pay, I will try it when I am out shopping today. Robert Macdonald Play store now showing as uncertified, Android pay loads but says cannot be used. Otherwise it installed just fine on my pixel. Andreas Constantinides 6p here, got the issue. JoeInMO On my Pixel XL I get "Android Pay can't be used on this device." I'm not rooted or bootloader unlocked. I never had Pay set up before. Matty032 I have the same error. Maxime Labrecque-Raymond Got the issue and my DOTs dosen't work Nexus 6P blacleyeX2 The OTA Nexus 6P failed, but I can confirm that Android Pay is now working and I have used it for a transaction. Not sure how that worked, any ideas? Marty Got the error. 6P. blacleyeX2 The available images are only for the images ending 17 and not the new 19, so we can't side load yet. mieszk3 All of you with unlocked bootloader -> manually flash via fastboot: bootloader, boot, radio and recovery and then 019 OTA will work.

I'm not desperate to update my 6P. I don't use it anymore. Ultra Sage My nexus 5x worked fine for the first few hours. Then when this update came out, I tried installing it but my phone kept on crashing and restarting after every few minutes. It was not bootloop since I could receive calls, but if I opened anything else, then it would crash and restart. I finally managed to use terminal to unlock the boot loader and restore nougat factory image, since the OTA download would stall the screen, and it would restart. I was a beta tester for Nougat, but this was a bad experience. Kris Fannin Same issue with my Nexus 6P. Update fails. Just another data point for you and thanks for the information. ctk4949 I was about to switch back to my Pixel XL from my S8+. But when I tried connecting my Gear S3 watch, it wouldn't open the app. It force closes each time. :( Matt McNair After the update Android Pay will launch but I just tried to pay with it and I get a message stating that my Pixel XL isn't eligible. Had to pull out the ole wallet. StW I tried to apply this update twice on my Nexus 6P but each time the updated failed near the beginning of the install. However, yesterday Android Pay was not working (unsupported developer version message) but today, even though the install failed, Android Pay works. Cael Android Pay works on my Pixel XL after receiving this update. Ernie I think Google might have pulled the . 19 update for the Nexus 6p. I haven't gotten a notification for the update for almost 2 hours now. EnerJi I still have a notification pending on my Nexus 5X. I wonder if that means it's been fixed on the 5X? I've been holding off on trying it until I see some folks confirm that it works for people who OTAd from 7.1.2. Matty032 At first I got the root error with Android pay. But, I cleared cache and then restarted the phone. I was then able to complete the transaction. Works now. That's after Google Chat Support told me it wouldn't work with O. LOL Ian Kumlien 019 ota is up and will apply on a 017 Android O OTA (as in N -> O) phone via ADB sideload Guilherme Noronha Just got the update notification again after failing​ to install this morning.

At Google I/O 2017, there were a slew of announcements about the ascendency of the Google Assistant and the continued expansion of Android. But smack between these two was news about updates to Android TV, the space where many of Google's recent efforts overlap. One of the big changes Android TV users will see in the coming months is Android O arriving on their devices. The new TV homescreen for O moves six content shortcuts to the top, which users can edit and reorder. This is where you'd put the Netflix or YouTube app. The rest of the page is given over to new channels provided by content producers. Netflix, for example, can put a sample of its offerings in a horizontal scrolling bar. Providers can also create specific channels. In a hands-on demo with Android O, I saw both a YouTube channel and a separate channel for trending content on YouTube. Content providers create the channels, but users can edit which ones appear on their homescreens and the order in which they appear. A new onboarding experience will give users a chance to choose some channels, such as business or technology news. Android TV O can also detect if you have content apps installed on your phone, and will automatically add those to the homescreen. Videos on Android TV will also have auto-playing previews in Android O. As you highlight the static images displaying different shows, they begin to play after a short delay. It's certainly engaging, but personally I was turned off by the idea of auto-playing anything. Oh Hey, Google This year, Google announced that the Google Assistant will be coming to even more platforms — including iPhones. But Android TV will also be playing host to Google's Alexa competitor. It will also be a wide rollout, coming to Android TV devices running Marshmallow, Nougat, and O. The Assistant will also be available on skinned Android TV devices, like the Nvidia Shield streaming box and even branded cable boxes from cable providers. On TV, Google Assistant will function much the same as Alexa and Siri on their respective streaming boxes. You can ask it to play movies, perform searches, and so on. The Assistant does bring some more subtle tricks to the TV, however. For example, you can continue to have a conversation with the Assistant, and reference previous results. You can ask "What is Stranger Things" and see a card talking about the hit Netflix show. You can follow that up with a second question asking "how many episodes is it?" The Assistant understands that by "it" you mean Stranger Things and it will display the answer. All of this is done on-screen, even while other video content is playing. Related The Coolest Things From Google I/O 2017 The Coolest Things From Google I/O 2017 I have an Apple TV at home, and I've been surprised at how much more capable Siri on the iPhone is compared to its TV counterpart. The Google Assistant on Android TV, on the other hand, seems to be as capable as ever. You can ask the Assistant how long it will take to get to work while you're watching Netflix, and a card will appear on the bottom third of the screen with the relevant information. This last point was briefly touched on during the Google I/O keynote presentation. The Google Assistant and the Google Home will soon be taking advantage of nearby screens to present relevant information in response to voice queries. It could push driving directions to your phone or display a weather report on a Chromecast connected TV, for example. This year's Google I/O was very much centered around the idea of Google being an "AI first" company. Putting the Google Assistant into the company's big-screen experience is definitely a step in that direction, but whether people will change their habits, asking questions about the weather or stocks to a TV, remains to be seen.

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us YouTube VR gets a worthy update, removes comments in favor of voice feedback By Rei Padla - May 19, 2017 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter YouTube VR was launched last year together with the Google Arts & Culture VR apps for Daydream View. After months of testing, the app is getting an important update that makes YouTube VR a more enjoyable experience. Watching videos in virtual reality can be fun but some text comments can be distracting and this time, Google devs removed them so you can watch in 360-degrees. Now that Google is going full force in AR and VR, it’s about time we also get serious with using such apps because they’re not just for novelty experiences. Virtual reality and augmented reality can soon be a standard part of our mobile lifestyle. Over at the Google I/O 2017, the tech giant announced the update that will hopefull attract more consumers. The company has high hopes for the Daydream platform and this updated YouTube VR is expected to offer a more immersive experience while still being communal. When watching a video on YouTube VR, you can join other people in watch. It’s like getting into one room and seeing other people watch with you at the same time. Each person becomes an avatar for identification. There won’t be text comments but viewers are free to comment by voice. Definitely, it’s a new experience worth trying. It puts YouTube-ing into a whole new different level. Google is said to be introducing more enhancements to the current VR apps available as it continues to develop the Daydream VR platform. The VR system is also being updated to a new version called Daydream 2.0 Euphrates. Not much information on the upgrade but it will also include recording and add streaming of a VR experience via Google Casting. VIA: SlashGear Story Timeline Google launches YouTube VR, Google Arts & Culture VR apps for Daydream View YouTube Kids app can now be accessed from select smart TVs YouTube testing out new look and feel for selected users YouTube TV adds more channels, including AMC, BBC America TAGS Android virtual reality VR Youtube YouTube VR Rei Padla Must Read HTC U11 Hands-on: squeezing every last measure available BlackBerry KEYone Review Samsung Galaxy S8 Review Community 922.5klikes 476.8kfollowers 85.9kcomments / Free WordPress Plugins and WordPress Themes by Silicon Themes.

How Google plans to tackle power consumption even more aggressively in Android Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/05/18 5:29pm PDTMay 18, 2017 13 Plus 1 on G+ 93 Share on Facebook 55 Share on Twitter Total Shares161 Android OS Development Google News Videos Yesterday at I/O Google had an interesting talk called Background Check and Other Insights into the Android Operating System Framework. It's a long name, but really it's about improving battery life in Android. It went on at great length as to how, exactly, they plan on doing that, and it's quite worth a watch. We have the video here, but if you don't have the half-hour to check it out, then you are welcome to read below. The central methodology Google is using to try to improve things is the idea of visibility. When something is running in the background and doing a ton of stuff like calling your location at quick intervals, it results in battery drain. So now Google wants to change how things happen in the background, by ensuring that free-running background services aren't sucking your battery dry. Background apps will be pushed out of memory when they leave the foreground, and requests for things like location or WiFi happening in the background will only occasionally see new information from Android. Applications that would otherwise receive broadcasts also might not wake up unless they are given an explicit call to do so in the broadcast, although there are some exceptions. Apps can still get around this by being foregrounded in some way, but now that will be something visible that the user is aware of. This focus on visibility for apps will also mean developers will have to make decisions about what is really better to the user. If doing an ongoing notification as a means of bypassing the stuff above would confuse a user, is that really the right thing for them to do in that case? Other tools can be used to schedule your tasks ahead of time or to wait for events like the job intent service that developers can use in both pre and post-O environments. Jobs and alarms also allow the OS to defer. So, if something happens that would trigger a bunch of other apps to wake up, like a new picture being taken, that can be passed to those apps one at a time after a delay. That way the user doesn't suddenly have a ton of performance issues and drain out of nowhere. Basically, Google wants to solve some of the problems with battery life by defining bad behaviors for developers, like persistent background services or accidental leaks to the background of typically foregrounded activities, and make it clear that things have to be done the right way going forward or their stuff won't work. But it's also giving them new tools and choices for how to best accomplish the things they need to do. The new features in the Play Console and in Android Studio should also help developers be aware of when they are making these mistakes so that they can be fixed. It's a matter of visibility for the developers as well as visibility for the users. To paraphrase Steve Balmer: Visibility, visibility, visibility. A significant user-facing change of this visibility mindset is a new battery menu in O, with a focus on actionable interaction. Instead of just seeing stuff like Screen and Google Play Services next to a number that they won't understand, now users will be given ways of interacting with that data if they don't like it, and can better see how they are using applications without needing to do a bunch of mental calculations. So, when a user has a problem with their expectations of battery performance and goes looking to see what might be causing it, they are more likely to find what caused it, understand what it means, and take action about it. All of these changes are is in pursuit of Google's holy grail: multi-day battery life. Right now the tools in software aren't all there, but these are steps that can take us in that direction.

Good feature to take from iOS Knowledgeborn Allah This does seem similar to what Apple implemented in iOS, but I'm curious about how this will impact RAM management. If it reduces the cache file too much, it'll just close the application completely, and you'll have to start over every time you want to use the app again. Apple somehow found a way around this problem, even in devices with less RAM, but I'm not too sure how Google will accomplish this. Even "doze" on my Pixel XL kills apps in the background all the time. This new thing sounds it could potentially make the problem worse. Justin Osborne Well I sure can tell a difference since upgrading, that's for sure. The new battery section makes me feel a lot better about how the battery is looking. But that's where it ends. Today, I got a full hour less out of my battery than normal. 2 hours vs 3-3.5 on the Pixel. That said, it's a beta, so I'm not complaining. It's definitely not the direction I want to go tho (nor are these new emoticons, sigh). marcusmarcus2 "Google's holy grail: multi-day battery life." I'm glad, but can we get a two pronged attack to address this. Yes, Google needs to keep improving the software side, but OEMs need to help out and quit making thinner phones. They are thin enough, give us more battery capacity. AbdulB1 actually they save quite a lot by putting small batteries in the phones instead of big ones. Krzysztof Jozwik I'm not sure you read OP's comment. Nothing was said about saving... AbdulB1 smaller capacity battery is much cheaper marcusmarcus2 My original comment was not about savings, cheapness, cost, etc. Jack Jennings You've said the same thing twice for no reason. Krzysztof Jozwik I wouldn't say "much" I'm no expert on the matter, but last I checked replacement batteries aren't that expensive, and I don't have the buying power of an oem AbdulB1 Most phones today dont have replacement batteries, they have unremovable ones. OEM or no OEM a 3000mAh battery will always be cheaper than 4000mAh one. marcusmarcus2 I can find batteries for my different Moto G phones that have "Non-User replaceable batteries" for nearly the same price as my LG phones that have user replaceable batteries online. Most likely the OEMs can get them for about the same as well so replaceable or not really does not matter. Either way, yes a 3000mAh battery will be cheaper than a 4000mAh one for OEMs, but probably not much at all, especially at the volume they would by at. I'm guessing they are choosing smaller batteries to make their phones thinner and not because it is slightly cheaper for them. Thinness is better to advertise to most consumers as most consumers are drawn to looks over functionality now a days. I still prefer function over looks for my devices. Krzysztof Jozwik And non replaceable will always be cheaper than replaceable. The point is, the batteries aren't the bulk of the cost. Geoff Johnson What the hell is your point? He never said anything about cost, he was just talking about stop making phones thinner for design and aesthetic reasons. james fuston The idea that smaller and thinner phones result in less battery life is a bit of a misnomer. For an example, I'd refer you to the iPhone SE. marcusmarcus2 I never said smaller and thinner. I just said thinner. They could make some of the phones the same height and width as the current one but make it a little thicker to give a thicker battery, and that would help with the battery life. james fuston Okay, but your general sentiment is still that battery life is tied directly to physical size which, again stating my example of the iPhone SE, isn't the case. The power draw of the components is far more important than the physical size of the phone. marcusmarcus2 My general sentiment is ONLY in regards to thickness of the phone. My sentiment is not to width or height, which also make up the size of the phone. The width and height is usually determined more by the screen where thickness is more often do to battery. A larger screen (component) will draw more power than a smaller screen, I agree with you there. But you seem to think the size of the battery does not make a difference, please correct me if I am wrong. Using your example of iPhone SE, if they would have made that a little thicker than it is now by making the battery larger, that would have made the battery life even longer than it already is. That is my point. james fuston > A larger screen (component) will draw more power than a smaller screen, I agree with you there. Let me give this one more shot. "your general sentiment is still that battery life is tied directly to physical size which, again stating my example of the iPhone SE, isn't the case" To break out the pieces, battery life is tied...to physical size...which, again...isn't the case. In other words, we do not agree. The iPhone SE is the exact same size as the iPhone 5S and it gets 30%+ better battery life purely through efficiency in components. To say high mAh results in long battery life is a misnomer that the G6 or V20 should be a clear reminder of. You also cannot equate physical size to battery capacity as energy density is not a universal measurement. marcusmarcus2 You are comparing different phones with different components. I agree with you that component efficiency has an effect on battery life. But... Let me give you one more shot. We will use your iPhone SE for this. If there were 2 versions of the SE. Both have the exact same components except one has a battery that is 1000 mAh larger than the other (thus making it slightly thicker), than the one with the larger battery would have more battery life, Thus the thicker one would have better battery life. That is what I am saying. I'm not comparing large phones to small phones. I'm saying if they had a larger battery in a phone with the exact same specs/components then the battery life would be better. That is all my point was. Do you not agree with that? EDIT: Yes, size of the battery may not increase with capacity due to density, but it usually will increase in size as it does increase in capacity, especially if it increases a lot. Geoff Johnson Again, you're talking about it being smaller. The iPhone SE gets good battery life because it has a 4" screen. The complaint is that phones are getting THINNER. Meaning that they still have 5.5-6" displays, but are thinner and translate to smaller batteries. james fuston Nope, not at all. The cell in the SE is about 50mAh bigger than the 5S (which is the exact same size). The 30%+ battery life improvement comes from more efficient components, not just their size. marcusmarcus2 Technically it is 2 dimensional train of thought. Also, if they increased it horizontally or vertically, then they would most likely have to increase the dimensions of the phone horizontally or vertically, thus changing the size of the screen or bezel. Increasing it thickness wise means they would not have to change the look of the of the front of the phone. Anywho, I'm only talking about thickness, not height, width, different components, different phones, not small phones or big phones. I'm talking just battery capacity, if all other components remain the same. Thickening the battery would add battery capacity without changing the over all look much at all. It could be any phone of your choosing. If adding a thicker/higher capacity battery to whatever 1 phone you want, that phone would have a longer battery life. Do you not agree with that logic? JD The SE wasn't thinner. Ryne Hager Give me a OnePlus with 5000mAh and I would be so happy. someone755 Give me a 4.7" phone like the og Moto X and I would be so happy. Neither of us are going to be happy, Ryne. Drakenoid OG Moto X updated for current year would be perfect for me. Kristian Ivanov I highly agree on the thin phones part. Bought a Huawei P10 2 days ago, for me, that thing is unusable without a case to make it a bit fatter. Karly Johnston If they fix idle battery drain that doesn't become an issue. marcusmarcus2 I'm not saying they should not fix battery drain. I'm saying if they fix battery drain AND add higher capacity battery (making phone a little thicker), they could increase battery life even more than just addressing one of them. So if fixing the battery drain adds another day and a thicker battery adds another day, you'd go from 1 day to 3 days instead of just 2 days from only fixing battery drain. Karly Johnston The battery life the current 625 phones are getting is where flagships need to be. That should be enough for anyone. marcusmarcus2 Everyone is not all the same. It may be enough for you. I'm saying, phones are beyond thin enough and could be thicker to increase battery life even more beyond what a 625 phone can do. Now, this is my opinion in regards to how I would like to use a phone. You are welcome to your own opinion. I'm not going to say what should be enough for anyone other than me. Karly Johnston The OEMs don't think that is what the vast majority of people need or want. Their target is a full day of battery life which is what most people are worried about. It isn't my opinion, it is the industry opinion of what the marketing priorities are. X-47B My phone has 4000 mAh battery, and it's 5.5-inch display. I easily get 2 days of battery even after heavy usage. Margaritas Ante Porcos Installed O on my 6p and battery still drains like a whore in a bukkake twelvesome. Google really can't do nothing at this point. Android is breaking to pieces. So many things needed to be fixed in O but instead Android's got even worse. That notification empty desert area of white grey nothingness kills me the most. Hate it really bad. The last Android I liked was 6th. catalysto Not sure what you're talking about. Battery life on my 6P with the new O is great. Maybe you have an aging battery? Margaritas Ante Porcos as long as your 6p works great, nothing else matters, right? Roy That's right. catalysto Just saying. My anecdotal evidence is as good as yours. And having poor battery life across multiple OS versions is a pretty strong indicator for a bad battery, don't ya think? In fact, I had the same problem with a previous 6P. iFeign Complain some more about your beta software Margaritas Ante Porcos It started with 7.1.2. Do you really need to be a btch when bad things happen to others? Roy For me everything goes smooth on my 6P on 7.1.2. so I need to complain that Android to good. The Wrath of Kahn If your 6P has shut down even once before reaching about 5% then you most likely have one of the defective batteries. I had to have mine replaced, but after that, it runs all day like a charm. ODP2 improved it, if anything. Margaritas Ante Porcos it was fine for a long time until I updated to 7.1.2. That update screwed the battery that was working superb all the time. DANA Try to do a factory reset, it fixes many problem for some user. Margaritas Ante Porcos It was one of the first things I did. Twice. Did not help. Paul_Werner Yeah you got to call Google (if you got yours from the Play Store). They've been replacing 6Ps with factory refurbished ones even out of warranty (source: it happened to me) Matthew Skalecki The update didn't screw up your battery. The battery was going to crap out on you regardless of which Android version you had. This happened to many people including me. Replacing the battery fixes the issue; reverting to a previous os does nothing. Zach Mauch Did you go through Google or a local shop? The Wrath of Kahn Unfortunately it was out of warranty, had a friend with the skills do it for me. JD I need more of this colorful imagery to describe simple everyday problems. mchalakov First off you are using a beta OS don't complain. Second thing is that battery drain comes mostly from the (bad)apps - if you watched the video or read the article you could understand. Third - I'm pretty sure you can go back to Marshmallow if you are so so so unhappy with Nougat or O. Jakst Really? Yesterday was my first day with Android O. I plugged my phone out at 7, and come home at midnight with 35 % battery left. I've never had that kind of battery life in my 6P before. So I've seen huge gains with this O preview. thereasoner The Android O beta I'm using is so slow to charge my Pixel today that it seems like that's what they tackled​....and not in a good way. iFeign Surprise, surprise, you're running BETA software. Smh. thereasoner Yeah I know and I'm sure it will get fixed between now and September. I'm just saying that the current difference in charge time is quite noticable at this point. AbdulB1 maybe they removed quick charge support in beta mattcoz Pixel never had quick charge. AbdulB1 hmm interesting. I thought it has qualcomm processor so it must have qc 3.0 too. Must be some proprietary stuff or qualcomm must be asking for more money to enable it. mattcoz Google is pushing the open USB-C power delivery standard. AbdulB1 Display screen eats up most of my battery. I can't see what google is doing will fix it somehow. We need different types of screens now. iFeign Uhh, it's as if you expect things to use NO battery at all. Infinite battery life! Of course using the screen, aka, using the phone, is going to be the largest proportionate power drain - no matter how fancy the screen tech. AbdulB1 battery tech has still not improved and nor did the screen tech. I can accept that the screen tech will remain same for a long time but as far as batteries are concerned they can be improved , made for longer number of recharge cycles but that hasn't caught up with the manufacturers yet. One thing which can be done is increasing the battery capacity but we all know this is not happening as phone manufactures think it will make phones bulky , add weight and in long term affect the sale of newer devices. Latheryin Multi day battery life will not happen until new battery tech comes around. With people needlessly having screen on times of 5+ hours there is no way to keep a battery charged for extended periods. Krzysztof Jozwik I average 2 hours of screen on time a day. Just because some use their phone 24/7 doesn't mean we all do. I have a job where I'm not on my phone, at home I have better screens to get info from. The phone is there when I need it. Your nonstop use case is not the norm. Latheryin As do I but that is not the norm. Might want to look at any forum about battery life and looking at screen on times. Most want and use 5+ hours. It's mainly the older generation like us that doesn't need it and are not on the device all the time. Krzysztof Jozwik Obviously the forums about battery life have people winning that they want 48 hours of screen on. That is not the norm. Sure, lots of people want that, most do not. Latheryin Most want more screen on time. Why do you think battery life is such an issue. disqusdeeznuts My Moto Z Play begs to differ. Motorola does it right with this phone. It has a good size battery (3510), an efficient processor, and runs smooth. It can be done, but for some reason, it just isn't a focus for a majority of manufacturers. Latheryin Well sure all the devices with that mid range chip and battery combo can get ok battery life. I could easily. Get 2 days out of my device and it only has a 3200 battery. It is not the oem. It's people. They need to spend less time look at their phone and more time living life. Which many are unprepared for. Cakefish I'm going the leaked Moto X4 continues that legacy onwards! Rod Ever heard of the Moto z Play, or Lenovo P2? Latheryin As already stated on that. The moto has a mid tear chip. As for the Lenovo, nope. Can't say I have, it's either not sold in my country or a mid low tier device that I wouldn't have noticed. Just looked. They both use the same mid tier chip. Also that does have a good battery. But that like the K1000 with a 10000 battery are the exception and seldom are they flagship quality. WarpspeedScp The Moto z does not have an SD 820 on it. Neither does the P2. It's very annoying that manufacturers can't give us something functional instead of eye-candy for once. Rod While it's not top of line sillicon, real world testes have proven that, for everyday tasks, there's virtually no difference between the S625 ans 821 WarpspeedScp Well, my phone has an SD 650, and dolphin emulator just about keeps up (wind waker and super smash Bros). On an 820, there would definitely be better results. Paul Troy I have a better idea. Get the hardware manufacturers to put a bigger battery in their devices. 💡 Taedirk If we could convince hardware manufacturers to do something useful, we wouldn't be on yet another revision to how Android updates the OS. Alex Yeah so this way the horrible wakelocks (that Android makes almost impossible to manage) will be less visible. Cakefish Why not both? Zach Mauch All I want to know is can they stop wakelocks. JD Same bullshit every year. I'll believe it when I see it. Unless Android O somehow allows me to download more mAh. Morten Ulv Are you trying to say Android battery life hasn't improved VASTLY over the years? JD Yep in fact it's regressed Morten Ulv I have no such issues. Better battery all across the board. JD What ever you're smoking pass that shit around Morten Ulv Your shit must be stronger than mine. browngeek I miss the days of my Xperia Z3 Lollipop and Stamina mode. Used to get 48 hours and 5-6 hours SOT. D13H4RD2L1V3 I hope this actually does something when the final build is out. I'm getting tired of hearing of every new battery improvement in a new version of Android only to have a wakelock pretty much make all of that moot. Dennis Ulijn I am on the Android O beta, and i must say that the information i get from it it really useful! I never could find the wakelocks because i'm not rooted, but now i can easily see what apps use up battery in the background. Awake meditation app was in use for 15 minutes (meditation) and active in the background for 1 hour (basically, ever since the meditation)! "Restrict background usage" to on, and we'll see what it brings tomorrow. PI this is interesting .... :) ,, Whats the current update Dennis Ulijn I'm in Europe so I just woke up. I'll let you know end of the day. Sabin Bajracharya Meanwhile Google's own apps will somehow be able to bypass this restriction :D Michael Sørensen Google's own location services, Now cards, Chrome, etc. eats the most battery for me - even worse with location history on. How about fixing that first...? WarpspeedScp Try Firefox! Also, turn location off as soon as you can. mlm5em But with O, you can now turn off Background activity on an app specific basis. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/eaaaef5de863733535628a24f5b0d44f888ae3ff0cb89d1c8cffc0680083c526.png mattcoz Good to see there's an option to turn it off. Morten Ulv Very handy! IncCo Anything that improves the battery life is awesome John Monks I have concerns about this. There are some apps I *want* running in the background, but I don't want them filling up the notification shade. One example, Lightflow has to have a pointless notification in order to do the job I installed it to do. I know it's there, any consequences for my battery life are mine to live with. It would be OK if I could toggle a setting to permit a particular app to run a 'free running background service' silently but this is Google so I expect I'll have to put up with spam instead (and no, collapsed notifications are still notifications), or there will be a toggle that does nothing, like the 'ignore optimisation' setting that currently exists. Drakenoid There apparently is, check comments above, there's a screenshot. Cakefish It's about damn time. All hail Android O. AdamH So does it mean my phone will be useless? something_new Apple was right then Đức Thành I'm beginning to get excited again, even knowing that actually achieving this would take many years. Fidelator Allow us, the end user, to have absolute control over which apps can run in the background under certain conditions, I have disabled notifications on Facebook and Instagram yet they still have multiple persistent RAM hogging battery sucking services 100% of the time smeddy My next phone won't get a look-in without a 4000mah+ battery in it. Since Samsung dropped the removable battery, battery anxiety has crept back into my life.

Netflix was just the start: Google Play Console lets developers exclude app availability for devices that don't pass SafetyNet Rita El Khoury Follow View All Posts 2017/05/18 3:57am PDTMay 18, 2017 93 Plus 1 on G+ 108 Share on Facebook 82 Share on Twitter Total Shares283 Google News Last weekend, a huge turmoil swept the root-enthusiast Android community as it was discovered then confirmed that the Netflix app was being blocked from showing up in search results on the Play Store for rooted devices. At the time, Netflix said it was using Widevine to block unsupported devices, but that made no sense to us: the app was still functional if it was sideloaded, it was only not showing up as compatible in the Play Store. So what sorcery was Netflix really using?! Turns out it's a new function of the Google Play Console. As part of the updates announced for the Play Console at I/O 2017, Google mentions a new Device Catalog section under Release management that lets developers choose with intricate granularity which devices their app supports on the Play Store. Devices can be viewed and excluded by many attributes including RAM and SoC, but the important factor we're interested in is SafetyNet Attestation. New "Device catalog" lets devs manage the exclusions. Developers will be able to choose from 3 states shown in the top image: not excluding devices based on SafetyNet, excluding those that don't pass integrity, or excluding the latter plus those that aren't certified by Google. That means any dev could potentially block their apps from showing and being directly installable in the Play Store on devices that are rooted and/or running a custom ROM, as well as on emulators and uncertified devices (think Meizu and its not-so-legal way of getting Play Services and the Play Store on its phones). This is exactly what many of you were afraid would happen after the Play Store app started surfacing a Device certification status. This is different from the full SafetyNet API implementation that apps like Android Pay and Pokémon Go use. In the case of Pay/Go, the attestation check happens when the app is installed on your phone and doesn't allow it to run unless it passes the integrity test. But in the case of the Play Console, the attestation check happens when you're browsing the Play Store and only affects the availability of the app for your device. If the full SafetyNet API isn't included in the app itself, you will still be able to grab the APK from other sources, install it, and the app will work just fine. Still, this spells trouble for rooted users and the Android enthusiast community as a whole. Google keeps erecting more and more obstacles each day in the face of root and custom ROMs and even if this won't stop root users who should be knowledgable enough to know how/where to grab an APK and install it, it will make things more and more difficult and maybe less and less worth the trouble. But y'all are rebels and you'll keep on finding a way around it, won't you?

Nice move Google. Suicide_Note Not sure if serious, but either way, this was just a matter of time. YouNex Obviously not serious EowynCarter So, question : Is there anyway to get android O in the future on my nexus 6 and not having problems with this ? IF manufacturer where taking care of updating their devices, wouldn't be an issue... saf1927 If Magisk keeps working, yep. You can. Even my old Nexus 5 is on 7.1.2 and it passes SafetyNet. EowynCarter I want "just work" stuff. Not workaround. Maybe Magisk does the job for some, but not an acceptable solution from my point of view. Mainly the "we don't know if it will keep on working" part. saf1927 Well, it's the best solution so far and it has improved a lot since its inception. I never bothered since the Nexus 5 was a secondary device for me, but now that some apps won't show up anymore on the Play Store, I simply flashed Magisk and that's about it. I haven't tweaked anything. Plus, if you are already flashing a custom ROM, flashing an extra zip file isn't that much work anyway. EowynCarter True, but it's the phone I use dailly. I don't want apps sudendly not working, becasue google decided to push an update that broke magisk. mxwp well if you want things to "just work" then i guess get an iPhone EowynCarter Sadly, I'm beginning to think about that. But that would cause others frustrations. ED-Zが現れた! Well, people will just flock to root-supported apps... Milton P. I actually forgot when was the last time I Rooted a device. No biggie. Suicide_Note The bad thing is it isn't just root that causes problems. Simply unlocking the bootloader will produce the same result. Maxr1998 Just because it's no biggie for you, it doesn't mean everyone approves this. I am actually pretty concerned, because this limits the freedom over our devices even more.. Milton P. Define freedom, please. Maxr1998 Software freedom, to be more specific. You should have the freedom to use and modify your device and it's software however you'd like, and have fill control over it. That means, root access. And since the AOSP core IS free software, the 4 freedoms defined by Richard Stallman apply to it. What this change now introduces is that you're forced to decide between either giving up the freedom over your device or not using the app you wanted to download (which will probably have to be my choice, and that sucks). Milton P. But you're not giving up anything, you just have to make a choice. If you put that way, Google has the freedom of doing with the AOSP core whatever they want, the same way you can modify said core and do as you please, the difference is Google has more money and more responsibilities when it comes to their user base. XDA and other sites will still have a bunch of developers making whatever they please (within the AOSP terms) with the AOSP core. This will just change thinks for the people that use those ROMs bit realistically the vast majority of users won't feel the changes. Sad but true. h4rr4r That choice is giving up freedom you had before. The vast majority will see the rate of Android improvements slow as the Devs on XDA and the like lose interest. Android only exists because of Linux, now it is turning its back on that whole culture. Milton P. Well, I don't see your freedom compromised to be honest with you, but we're seeing things from different angles so that's that. Sorry for your loss in that case. h4rr4r You do not think losing control of your device is a loss of freedom? Milton P. Nope, is just a device, I have more important stuff going on, m device is a tool the same way a hammer is a tool, you can buy a hammer and use it as it is. Sometimes my device is a toy, if I buy a remote control car I'll modify it as long as it is possible, the same way I modify my phone. I have control over my phone. I can install whatever I want at my own risk. If I decide to root my phone I expect things to be broken. I remember when I had an HTC and I hated sense so I decided to install a custom ROM, I gave up the camera and I was aware of it. There was always some compromises with custom ROMs, nothing is changing. I rather have a safe device then a compromised one today, still my choice thou. h4rr4r So you want IOS. Got it. Over here I want freedom. I don't think homedepot should be allowed to tell me what I can hit with the hammer I bought. trparky Open platforms rarely stay open once they become popular. Once the Benjamins come rolling in it tends to override open. h4rr4r Tell that to Linus Torvalds. I am sure he will have many many fuck yous for you. trparky Linux is the rare situation. h4rr4r The rare situation like many others that created android and even google. trparky Yeah but look at Android, the walls are closing around it and there's nothing you can do about it. Face it man, the geeks may have built the system but the common man now rules it. Geeks love choice, yes, they do love their choice but your average person doesn't give a rat's ass about choice. All they want is a device that does what they need it to do when they want to do it. They have no inclination to learn how it works or why it works just as long as it does. This is what geeks do not and refuse to understand. h4rr4r Sure there is, stop using it. Then the common folks will have to follow us to the next platform. trparky As long as their is money involved in maintaining Android it doesn't matter if something better comes along, people will continue supporting Android because it makes them money. Money makes the world go round, get used to it. Maxr1998 ^ What @h4rr4r:disqus says. trparky Yep. The root and ROM community is such a small portion of the Android ecosystem that they really don't matter to them. People have been screaming at Google for years to get the Android house fixed up, this is them doing just that. You can't blame them for doing what the people have asked for. mxwp I agree with you, but sadly you only have freedom over hardware. You can do what you want with the device you buy. But with software you never actually buy it... you only buy a license to use it. Thus you have no real freedom with software. Maxr1998 Android is free software, Apache 2.0 license. At least the AOSP part of it. trparky But the Google parts of it are not covered under the Apache 2.0 license. That's essentially why ROM developers can't package the Google Play Services pack with the ROM itself and instead requires you to download a separate ZIP package from Google to install it separate from the ROM package. Android itself may be free and open but the Google Play Services part is not. Sudev There are far more than few arguments against root access but here are some: Root access is meant for experimental & development purpose and not for Daily Driver for any average user of the platform. Google Play Services & Apps available on Play Store are not "Free Software". Google as provider of Play Services infrastructure has much more liabilities then one can simply assume. And also the app developers have responsibility to protect end users' data. If device has root access available and any rouge app / maleware steals other apps data which is possible, who will be at stack? h4rr4r The ability to do anything I want with my things that I own. Milton P. You​ can do whatever you want with your device, nobody is stopping you. You might see that some apps are not showing up in the play store but you can still side load them, I still see freedom in your future. h4rr4r For how much longer? Soon these apps will ask play services if they are supposed to be installed on that device, at that point you can say goodbye to sideloading. If this is what people want then IOS was the platform for them. thecoolkid Ok Google, define freedom... 😁 Nick I would imagine a great deal of people on this site will be upset, but in actuality I don't think this will affect the user base of many apps that badly h4rr4r Not in the short term. However in the long term it will. Android only exists because of the FREE software movement. Nick Yes, but that doesn't apply to applications, which this is about. h4rr4r Think long term. Same thing applies. trparky No it won't because the root and ROM community is so small it doesn't matter to Google anymore. The 95% of people who simply want a device that works don't care and likely won't ever care. As long as they can play NetFlix, Pokemon Go, or whatever is the next craze they don't care. h4rr4r Again, that is short term thinking. Think past the end of your nose. Android exists because of linux. Google needs this small group to create the very stuff they rely on. trparky You overestimate the value that the community has now. Android may have needed the community back in the beginning to gain the foothold that it has in the market but not so anymore. Android has near 100% market penetration, they have achieved world domination. They don't need the community anymore, they have achieved their goals. h4rr4r Until they are unseated. IBM once had a monopoly on computing devices. They did not need the community to gain a foothold, they would not have a product to gain a foothold without the community. Android only exists because of a collection of those projects. trparky No, Android exists because Samsung, HTC, and LG make devices people want and it makes them money by the semi-truck full. The community doesn't mean shit now, all that matters to these companies is one thing... money, money, and more money. Oh, and did I mention money? This is capitalism man, money rules the world. If you don't make money you are dead. h4rr4r Please tell me how that would have happened without linux. Money loses to good engineering every day. Look at how linux killed solaris. trparky Tell me why Windows is the defacto monopoly on the desktop despite the fact that Linux is better in every damn way possible under the hood? That's right... money. h4rr4r Because the desktop is dead. The fight is over. They lost. Even money can't keep them relevant. trparky Oh, you're funny. The desktop is not dead, it will never be dead. When people need to do real work, they sit down at a desktop. When people want to play real games, they sit down at a desktop. When people need to type out anything longer than a page like a college term paper, they sit down at a desktop. The desktop is king and will always be king. Long live the desktop! h4rr4r The Desktop is a dead man walking. When they do real work, they use a Citrix session. When they game they use a console, or they are already nerds. When people type they can use a fucking chromebook. The desktop as you think of it died already. trparky Try and say that shit over at TechPowerUp, HardOCP, Overclock.net, TomsHardware, etc. and trust me when I say this... you'll be run out of town by people with pitchforks and torches. h4rr4r Those are all nerds. Those are the folks who have desktops running 3 different OSes. They are the folks who are pissed about android being locked down. trparky And your point being? You just admitted that only the "nerds" care about Android being open. Sure, those same "nerds" will go off and create a new platform but the rest of the people who are living in the real world and who don't care one damn bit about how it works will continue to use Android. h4rr4r Those people will eventually move to the new platform. Just like they did with Android. trparky And the same thing will happen to that platform in the future that's happening to Android now. Open platforms are nice and all, I'll admit that, but your average person doesn't care one bit. I dare you to go up to any person on the street and ask them anything about Android. What phone do they have? What model? Most will say "I don't know, something that my carrier gave me for cheap." h4rr4r The wheel of computing we call it. It has happened and will happen again. So what? trparky Which reinforces the idea that I said before, eventually all open systems will become closed (or less open) at some point in their life cycle. It usually happens when it becomes popular with the common man. Why? Because like I've been trying to get through your thick skull, the average person doesn't care how any of this stuff works so long as it works. h4rr4r The average person does not matter. Few open systems become closed. AOSP is still fine. trparky What the hell do you mean by "they don't matter"? They're the ones buying the devices, buying the apps, looking at the ads, etc. Just how the fuck does that translate to "they don't matter"? h4rr4r Because they don't. They don't create, they don't cause new things to be created. They are just users, just like I don't matter to how movies are created. trparky But without money from the people who are consuming said things developers won't make new stuff. Developers do have to eat you know and put a roof over their heads. h4rr4r The giant world of FOSS pretty much proves you wrong. Demand cannot create supply. I don't pirate anything kiddo. I have way too much to lose for that. One of those lawsuits I would actually have to pay, since I could. trparky I'll give a hint on how FOSS works a lot of the time. Some of the top tier Linux kernel developers actually work for companies and they just contribute code in their free time. They may work for Intel, AMD, nVidia, or God knows what but only after their day job is done. Why? Because they need money and they need to eat. This is a basic requirement for people in this world. They need money!!! People don't just write code for the love of it, even Linus Torvalds who's in charge of the Linux kernel itself works for the Linux Foundation and yes, he gets paid for his work to the tune of $10 Million a year. Sorry to burst your bubble man but FOSS projects aren't all happy, happy, joy, joy here... people need to be paid real money to be able to eat, drive a car, put a roof over their heads, etc. On second thought, I'm not sorry I burst your bubble! You need it burst! PEOPLE NEED TO BE PAID REAL FUCKING MONEY!!!! h4rr4r No, they get paid to contribute. During the work day. Not as a hobby. Lots of projects are like that. I won't say exactly how I know about that ;) Their employers just aren't as short sighted as you. Linus did not however create linux to get rich. Great code like great art gets created because it must be. People do what they love. Kid, you will get it one day. When you have enough that you aren't worried about it each day, money stops being that big of a deal. Don't worry everybody goes through a phase like you are now. trparky Dude, we are not the Federation of Planets here living in a happy, happy, joy, joy world in which people can just do whatever they want to do without a care in the world. As long as human greed exists there will always be a need for money. And believe you me, greed will never go away unless we breed a new kind of human and I don't see that happening any time soon. Gene Roddenberry's future will never happen, it just won't. Contrary to a lot of geek dreams it just won't. h4rr4r No idea where you got that idea. Never suggested it. My point was the personal relative value of increasing income drops as income goes up. If you make minimum wage doubling your income is a huge deal. Adding the same amount to my income would not get me to take a job I like less. Offering it to Linus would be a waste of time. Yes, some people will keep chasing dollars, they are the exception not the rule. The employers are working on enlightened self interest. Either they use the FOSS product, gain market advantage with direct knowledge, use it for marketing or believe they are getting something else. PostgreSQL for example has a lot of paid contributors who work for companies that either provide customization, consulting or depend on the project. Others just because it increases quality. Commercial software by and large is not high quality. I have seen a lot of it and 90% if you tried to submit it to a FOSS project of any size would get you denied and possibly mocked. This system continues to be more innovative because it is easy to continue to expand. Anyone with a good idea can fork if their idea is not accepted. trparky > My point was the personal relative value of increasing income drops as income goes up. Tell that to the people in Washington or any CEO that demands ever increasing yearly salaries and end of year bonuses all while raping the companies that they work for. Tell that to the psychopaths on Wall Street. For as long as their is money, people will want more of it. Anyone who says that they don't is flat out lying. h4rr4r Those are the exception not the rule. That is why you call them psychopaths. Honestly, correcting for inflation I really don't care that much if I ever make more. Would it be nice sure, would I give up anything I like about my job? No. If you could double my income but it prevented me from contributing to FOSS projects or owning code I generate off the clock, I would not take that deal. If money was enough to make people do anything MS would have offered Linus $11 million a year to not write it. Heck, Sun would have done it while they were still around. trparky Either you're a child that doesn't know how the adult world works or you're a fucking troll. h4rr4r So you have no idea who makes stuff, neat. I guess you think Henry Ford should have made a faster horse. trparky Oh, I know who makes the stuff I use but I also make sure that they are paid! I give money to those developers who write the programs that I enjoy and if I can't pay them I won't use their programs. I only use a program if I can pay for it. I have put money into their tip jars on their web site, I look for PayPal links and I donate even if it's something small like $5. They deserve it! h4rr4r Good for you! There is a lot of great software that does not make money that way. Some even just ask is that you follow the license, like linux which mediatek steals by not releasing kernel source. So I hope you avoid buying that kind of thing. trparky MediaTek controller chips are known to suck so I don't buy them out of that reason alone. h4rr4r Now I have given you another good reason to avoid them. Bunch of thieves. Rita El Khoury I don't even remember when I last bootloader unlocked. But I know this move toward closing the ecosystem further and further will have ripples in the future. The enthusiast community flocked toward Android for its openness and we have custom ROMs and their enterprising devs to thank for HUNDREDS of new features that they implemented first and everyone clamored for and applauded until they became features in AOSP. If Google thinks it can steer this ship alone and it knows best what to do next, we may have less and less interesting features in the future and more and more of what only one entity thinks is best, not a diverse set of opinions. Nick Given that this only gives the developer the option of requiring these checks, it makes me believe that Google had to do this for some companies that have regulatory or other kinds of requirements. Which is a shame for the rooted (and unlocked?) community, but understandable. Shame Google is most likely going to take the blame here in this comment section though. Rita El Khoury Well, maybe they had to, but that won't stop any developer from implementing it without any regulatory or legal requirement pushing them to do so. Nick Right, which puts this choice on the developer, not Google. Google was stuck behind a rock and hard place, perhaps. EowynCarter Well, google is certainly to blame for not planing to update my nexus 6 to android O. And now I can't even use custom rom as plan B without losing some apps :( Suicide_Note Boo hoo. Buy a new phone and quit crying that Google doesn't support phones forever. EowynCarter Fine can you order a pixel XL and ship it to me in France ? Plus, my nexus 6 still works, I hate having to replace working stuff. Makes no sense, economically and ecologically speaking. Suicide_Note I'll sell you my XL when I'm done with it, but only after i get the Pixel XL 2. :) EowynCarter Well, I do hope Google sells the "pixel 2 "( or whatever its name) here. For now, I'm'just hoping my nexus 6 don't break. Else I might jump on the iOS ship. I'm not convinced the the other android alternatives. Note 8 would be the closest, but touchwiiz, delayed updates.... I'm spoiled after a few years with a nexus. Suicide_Note There always eBay or Swappa if you want to get a first gen Pixel. I was looking at prices over the weekend, and mint condition Pixels are going for about $450. EowynCarter Not so much in France. And eBay for suff that cost more that a few bucks, too risky. Plus, the pixel is getting "old" by now. Wilton Daniel Pinto Troll found trparky Yet Microsoft still supports Windows 7 EIGHT YEARS LATER! How come Microsoft can do that yet Google can't? Alex Louderback Actually, that's Qualcomm EowynCarter Source for this ? trparky And Qualcomm can go fuck themselves. Gee... I wonder why they're being hit with an anti-trust lawsuit. Could this be one of many reasons why? trparky Yes, Google is to blame for that. There's no damn reason why your Nexus 6 can't run Android O other than the fact that they just don't want to. Bojan Bunić My bootloader was unlocked prior to changing the mobo on my 5X, courtesy of Booty Loops. Root, well, probably before I got my Nexus 4. Although I'll see how it'll go on in the future, as we don't have Pixels here, so the only near stock possibility is either OnePlus, or some other device and a custom ROM. Milton P. Agree 100% with you, I mean I remember the old days when I hated HTC's Sense, I literally decided that a phone without a camera was better than whatever HTC did back then, but Android has evolved quite a lot nowadays, don't get me wrong, I do believe that custom ROMs did a great job showing Google what the users want but that won't change, as long as someone shows Google what people want Google will keep improving Android, because there's no limits. Now if they go the Apple way and lock EVERYTHING then we'll be fucked, I'm the meantime developers will find a way around the system pushing Google along. Premsuraj An open bootloader and root actually solves a lot of problems still existing in AOSP. The Nougat update absolutely destoryed the battery life of many Nexus 6P devices, with Google only focussing on the Pixels, there was no fix in it. I unlocked, used Franco Kernel + naptime + Greenify and I now I get adequate battery life. Another feature I can think of is theming. Material design is good, but the whiteness is rage inducing Maxr1998 Well, fuck them. Let's just hope not many devs will use this, and Google won't enable this by default anytime soon. Maxr1998 The more I think about this, the more concerned I get. This will reduce the freedom over our devices, and also limit developers in the awesome things they could do before because of Android's openness. I am all in for device security and fighting against malware, trojans and phishing applications, don't understand me wrong, but that doesn't mean that you have to take people away their freedom - just look at how Linux (GNU and Linux) is doing it. Tom Westrick How does this limit developers? If anything it gives them more control. Maxr1998 Fair point, I should have been more specific. With "developers", I meant rom developers and modders, app developers only if they require root access for their apps. "Normal" developers can use this to enforce a "secure" (read: DRM locked-down) environment, but that's not really a good thing in my opinion.. (Refer to my other comments.) trparky You're angry at the wrong people, you should be angry at Hollywood; they're the ones that are demanding this kind of stuff. Their content, their rules; it's how things are in the real world. They have to do what they need to do to protect their investments, plain and simple. We don't necessarily have to like it, hell... we may even hate it, but that's how it is. You want the content? Play by their rules. Colin Richardson If you are an app developer and want your app to run on custom roms..... don't turn on "Requires SafetyNet"... bekifft We are increasingly living in the future Richard Stallman warned us about. With Google taking all these steps, may as well go back to using jailbroken iPhones. Bart Janusz I've already enabled it and I know at least 3 others devs that did it as well. I really don't care about root per se, but custom roms and xposed is source of countless problem as both are buggy as hell. Maxr1998 But in which way does that influence you? Xposed can introduce bugs to the system, sure, but it won't affect the performance of your app unless it itself is modded, so you probably don't have to fear bad reviews for bad performance anyway. And custom roms? LineageOS on my mother's Moto G runs like a champ and much better than the 5.1 stock rom before. And in my experience as a dev, there were much more incompatibilities with Samsung TouchWiz than with AOSP-based custom roms. refthemc I'm sure he's just trying to avoid the headache of emails he gets daily from users who have no idea that it's their fault the app is not working or crashing... Bart Janusz Indeed, not to mention extra crash and ANRs reports which seems to influence app positioning. Maxr1998 But why? The device may behave more buggy at some parts because of Xposed (and mine definitely ran like shit on MM because of some mods, but I NEVER blamed any apps), but the apps itself won't run worse if not modded - normally they should even run better if you only use performance mods like Greenify, NLP Collector wakelock disabler and other light mods. I don't think he gets many reports anyway, considering what @marcusmarcus2:disqus said. Bart Janusz You may not, but many users do, and as I said there are a lot of bogus ANRs and crash reports. Since my app depends heavily on low level OS elements both custom ROMs and xposed are deal breakers (and you really should check source, since I do not update my website as I moved to G+/FB but app has sizable user base given its niche and I'd to deal with ROM/xposed issues fequently). Maxr1998 Well, but the same type of users also give bad reviews etc. without using any mod or root. You generalize modders to only cause problems, and therefore lock out everyone. About your app/website thing: fair point, I didn't look at it yet, and have to apologize for being a little rude. marcusmarcus2 You need to take your own advice, "you really should check source". If you moved to G+/FB, then why does your app on the play store still point to the same website as well. Or at least put a link on the old website that directs to G+/FB. There is nothing that points to your so called G+/FB source. So @Maxr1998:disqus has no other source to check at the moment. Bart Janusz Not that I care but if you try to draw conclusion about app you should probably visit Play Store listing. Anyhow that's really not important I just chimed in to explain why developer will use this. I've choose to do so due to extra burden which in effect hurts majority of my user base, one of my colleagues cited lucky patcher and freedom (which I think is not such a good idea but its his choice). trparky You may not blame the apps because you know better but most people don't understand that, most people see a crashing app and suddenly you see, as the developer, a ton of comments saying that your app sucks. h4rr4r Please do tell us about your apps so we can be sure to avoid them on any devices we have not yet rooted. marcusmarcus2 His disqus profile leads to this website http://artflowstudio.com/ which has a few apps listed. Art oriented apps. There is only 1 update on that website since 2014, so I don't think I would be to concerned about installing one of his apps. Jordan Palmer Nice detective work. Adrian I can see a lot of refund requests coming from people who paid for apps and suddenly are told "Nope. Not for you anymore." A lot of us are rooted and buy apps and you'd better believe noise will be made if an app I use daily, that I paid for, suddenly breaks with an update because it's no longer blessed by the dev to run on my device. It's your app and you can do what you want with it, but there is always another side to the coin. BAlGaInTl That's not the way that Netflix worked it, and I doubt other developers of paid apps would either. I have a OnePlus One, that I run Lineage OS on since the original Cyanogen OS is now defunct and does not receive any updates. Netflix simply doesn't update to v 5+. It still works just fine. I may not get the newest and latest features, but part of that is on me for using a device that is dated. I'm not one of those users who, because I paid for an app once, fells that I should get all of the updates from now until the end of time. That isn't sustainable for developers. It could very well be that Netflix has some new features/offerings in the works in which they are getting pressure from outside sources to push this. A lot of valid reasons for a developer to enable the check exist. As long as they do it in the same manner that Netflix has, I don't see the issue. Adrian And just like Pokemon Go, eventually you'll get a message that you need to upgrade to the latest version or the app won't work, you know, that new version that won't let you actually log into it anymore. We've already seen this happen so let's not pretend that it isn't the next logical step. They aren't going to keep letting people sign in indefinitely with an app that doesn't have the security level they want. It's naive to think that hey I can just stick with the last version that works for root. It takes all of what, the time it takes to create a switch that says minimum version required to log in is "DRM version" BAlGaInTl Good Point. I recognize that. But it seems that the blame (in general) is being directed at Google in many of these posts. If that scenario happens, it isn't Google that blocked you from accessing Netflix. The need for this level of security is on the increase. The same users demanding better security and longer updates are the first ones to cry foul when Google starts laying the groundwork for exactly what they have asked for. Adrian I think there is a way to do both that doesn't piss off a very active community that helped take Android from a very very very ugly, second class OS to what we have now. I know a lot of us remember just how crippled Android was and it was the root/mod community that produced the bulk of what is now standard on Android. There needs to be a way to secure the devices AND not turn their back on the developer community that contributes. The idea, in Netflix's case, that root = pirate is insane. Why in the world would someone prefer to rip content on their phone to say a computer or XBox that is never going to move and can do it while you get on with your life? They're doing something for the sake of saying they're doing something, but if they think it's going to make a dent in piracy they, and the studios are nuts. I watch a lot of Netflix and still prefer to buy discs. People who do things the right way and are perfectly happy paying for content shouldn't have to jump through hoops to watch it. Those of us who root usually have a handful of things that stock Android is not doing for us. It's why we root. If all of these things were available in stock, my reasons for rooting would disappear but I don't see that happening any time soon. I think Android is getting so much better but if they make it exactly like iOS, might as well go to the dark side because Apple's apps tend to be more polished, come out first and OS updates are frequent. Don't bite the hand that feeds you just because you're getting more popular. BAlGaInTl I think that Netflix is a good example. It is HIGHLY likely that the reason for recent unpopular changes (see also VPN blocking) are being driven by other entities. It isn't that Netflix thinks its a problem, but the people that control a large portion of their content do. root pirate but it does introduce a security risk. I don't see how Google is turning their backs on developers. Developers are free to develop as they see fit and choose (at least for the moment) whether or not they will implement the SafetyNet check. The inherent problem is that a circumvented security is still circumvented and can no longer be considered secure. I can clearly see why some apps would and should frown upon that. Maybe not Netflix and Mario (IMHO), but certainly something like bank and payment apps. I don't think the inherent open nature of android will ever reduce to the level of iOS. But some changes have to occur to meet the needs/desire of the majority. Security is inherently difficult. The easier and more flexible you try to make it, the less secure it becomes. Adrian I do think banking apps should run in a secure space. Completely agree with that, but I disagree with root = less secure. My nexus devices stopped getting OS and security updates. Nothing. VERY insecure and dangerous. I rooted them, updated the OS with images from XDA developers and my devices that were once easy targets are more secure. There is always two sides to it. I see that Google is finally trying to take security seriously on Android and doing things in layers that completely cut out the vendor AND the carriers is the right step. Right now, Root is the only way to update a perfectly good device like my Nexus tablet tablet that the vendor said "oh well" to. Until Google has a REAL strategy in place to keep ALL Android devices secure, root will be necessary. Not everyone wants to or can upgrade devices every two years because they get abandoned. My father doesn't need an S8. He does need a device that gets security updates for more than a year after purchasing his phone. BAlGaInTl You are exactly correct, and I'm in the same situation with my OnePlus One. But in working to increase your security level, you leave holes behind. The key words that you used are "more secure." I agree. You are "more secure." But still (probably) less secure than a device that has been thoroughly tested, certified, and passes SafetyNet without hacks. Google has been open that they are working on security updates. They have improved significantly over the last couple years in getting those out. I feel that they are putting in place a real strategy to keep Android devices secure. This is part of that groundwork. I also feel that they are actively looking to replace Android in it's current state, and I can't say I blame them. The only real strategy may be to take lessons learned and start over. Lucky for them, they have the resources to do so. trparky > take lessons learned and start over Pretty much. The worst thing that they did from the very beginning was to allow for the OEMs to do what they wished. Google essentially made a deal with the devil when they released Android to the world. They wrote no requirements into the Android agreements that the OEMs agreed to to require updates to be a necessary thing. Big mistake Google. BAlGaInTl The really needed to in order to get their foot in the door of the market. If it would not have been open source from the beginning, none of the major manufactures would have bought off on it. The fact that they could use it for free (essentially) and still be able to customize on top of it is what sold it. trparky And now look at it, Android is a fucking mess of non-updated insecure devices that are ripe for anyone to be able to take over and turn into a botnet. trparky And you should be raising holy hell with the OEM that made that device! Just because your device is old doesn't mean that it shouldn't still be supported. Windows 7 is nearly eight years old and it still receives Windows Updates. Why can't your device? BAlGaInTl Normally, I would agree, but the OnePlus One is a special case. The OEM operating system is the now defunct Cyanogen OS. I had to balance having the original OS without updates, or running another with updates. The phone is now almost three years old. If I bought a PC with Windows on it three years ago, and Microsoft had since gone out of business, should the PC manufacturer be responsible for providing Windows 7 updates? Even though the PC is beyond it's support date? Sure, I can increase the security by switching to another OS that is updated. It may even be a Windows clone. But if a software developer decided to only support "original, unmodified" PC configurations, that would be within their right. trparky But it can be adapted to run LineageOS. Sudev There is bit difference in analogy here: OnePlus manufactured the phone and Cynogen Inc customized AOSP Android OS for it, they didn't developed it from ground up. I understand that Cynogen INC is out of business now too. However in PC world, it would be the case that you purchased a PC from Dell and get Microsoft Windows OS with some additional Dell software. If Dell or developer of that custom software goes out of business you still get OS update for your PC. Its not android OS itself out business here. Adrian and for the record, I absolutely agree that it was the content providers and not all on Netflix. trparky You should be demanding that OnePlus send an official update to your device. So what if your device is old? It should be still supported. Windows 7 is still supported nearly eight years later, why can't your device be supported for that long as well? Plumplam Who cares except for a bunch of XDA nerds? If it means better security then I'm all for it. Dmitri Smirnov Well, for starters, it doesn't mean better security, since it does nothing to address the problems with vulnerable outdated android versions that will be "certified", but will allow malicious apps to quietly escalate their privileges and do their dirty work, but will block "uncertified" custom roms that actually have all the recent secuirity patches and give user full control over who has root access and how. Also, "bunch of XDA nerds" are the source of a lot of features that had their trial run in custom ROMs and then were adopted to the AOSP. Should I remind you of "The Oak and the Pig" fable? Alienate the developers bringing new ideas to the ecosystem - lose the competetive edge you had over other OSes saf1927 Actually, custom ROMs never really have the latest security patches despite what they claim since kernels aren't maintained and no proprietary blobs is updated anymore. If ROM developers were OEMs, they'd be violating their agreements with Google by bumping the patch level without actually addressing all the vulnerabilities. Dmitri Smirnov Well they patch the AOSP to the same level as latest official one and kernel - if it's possible to do so without breaking the compatibility with compiled blobs or at least on the level of latest official firmware. So in the end run it's at least as secure as the official firmware, often - much more so. saf1927 If you look at the security bulletin, most vulnerabilities come from proprietary drivers and require these to be updated. On a supported device, these are provided by the chip manufacturers to the OEMs, on an unsupported device they aren't updated anymore. A custom ROM can only fix userspace security issues. In the end, bumping the patch level without addressing all vulnerabilities in that patch gives a false sense of security to users. Dmitri Smirnov If anything, this is an argument for forcing OEMs to opensource their blobs. For some reason community is much better at releasing the fixes for what they can change (userspace), while OEMs generally stop caring as soon as device is out the door. saf1927 The problem goes beyond OEMs unfortunately. All the phones you can buy are assembled with off-the-shelf components that they buy from other manufacturers and it is them that provide the binary blobs to the OEMs. If they stop supporting components, the OEMs can't do anything. For the chip, it's companies like Qualcomm, Samsung, Mediatek etc. that need to support it with up-to-date drivers. Once they stop, the life-cycle of a phone comes to an end. trparky And that is probably one of many reason why Qualcomm is facing a nice fat anti-trust lawsuit. Serves them right. trparky That ain't ever going to happen. There's no way they're going to allow for their intellectual property to be open for all the world to see and have it cracked open. It would be corporate suicide since their competitors would be able to reverse engineer their stuff. Suicide_Note Never heard of "The Oak and the Pig" before. Could you tell me more? Seriously. Dmitri Smirnov http://www.aliceswonderland.eu/Alice-ska350-en.html Maxr1998 Ah, Lessing. Going to read the original version in a minute :) username_not_valid Thats a very generous view of the custom ROM community. It might be true of a few, very few devs, but most ROMs are unsupported garbage with serious security issues. Dmitri Smirnov Maybe so, but out of this cesspool of garbage CyanogenMod was born, which became LineageOS. I'd say their quality standard appeals me more than a lot of OEMs. username_not_valid Cyanogen and Lineage was what i had in mind.. Each to his own i guess. BAlGaInTl Yes and no. I run Lineage on my OnePlus One because Cyanogen OS is no longer supported. I can say with certainty that Lineage introduces stability issues that I have to deal with to be up to date. Wilton Daniel Pinto Ninna pooty bewarci Qwip Consider the bigger picture. Right now, users are being shuffled into a situation where they must restrict the control they have over their device if they want to be able to use Netflix (and presumably banking apps will follow soon). That may seem fine, and from some security perspective it is probably a good thing. How much control do you have over your _laptop_? How much do you want? Right now, we're blissfully able to install unsigned software on our computers (although various OSs will complain about it), but will that last? How long will it be before we can only open our banking interface on our laptop using a trusted, digitally signed browser on a machine that is using secure boot and can only run signed binaries? I can understand the direction that Netflix (and others) are coming from, and to them it may even make sense. The question is: what is the cost of ceding control over our devices/machines in order to be able to watch netflix, etc. trparky Yeah and that's why Windows is the virus filled cesspool that it is today. Windows 10 is slowly changing Windows to be an app store based ecosystem in which all apps will be sandboxed. It's coming to the desktop near you. saf1927 I hope Magisk (or other similar mods in the future) keep working, so to prevent this. Not a problem on my Pixel XL since I haven't rooted it, but on my Nexus 5 Magisk allows it to pass Safety Net even though it's running a custom ROM (7.1.2) and it's rooted. Hendrik Leppkes SafetyNets primary purpose is to secure devices for Android Pay, and when you deal with actual money transactions on your device, you really don't want any hack interfering with it - so I'm quite certain they'll do whatever they can to break hacks like this and ensure the security and integrity of the device. h4rr4r No, its primary purpose is to make the device trustworthy for others not the person who paid for it. This is how it makes it "secure" for android pay. You are a possible threat and this closes that. Suicide_Note It would seem that Google is erecting a wall around their garden, too. EowynCarter While Apple opens iOS more and more. YouNex According to the support/help page, a device is not certified if it stops getting Android updates. How fuck up is that ? I don't get it. My Moto X has always been on stock ROM, yet it's showing up as non certified. Yes it's rooted + system modifications, but at no point is it stated that root prevents it from being certified. Suicide_Note Really? You can't understand why your rooted/system modified device is non-certified? YouNex I know how to read, but this is vague https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/b6f710b8628f0e09ab73ba144c133a2c9b1fe1325b353ae7dc1636f2776b2ac0.png "Not secure" jonzey231 Root and/or unlocked bootloader = Not certified. YouNex It says nothing about root or bootloader https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/b6f710b8628f0e09ab73ba144c133a2c9b1fe1325b353ae7dc1636f2776b2ac0.png ast00 Can't wait until LastPass excludes root users... Fuck them. Adonis K. If they do, I'm cancelling my subscription... Naxx ENVY Fuck them and yet they haven't done anything yet ... #internetlogic Also i know right , crazy for a company that stores your passwords to make themselves more secure . ABSOLUTE CRAZY , RAGE RAGE RAGE Jordan Palmer I don't understand your reasoning or rationale for these two statements. ast00 The second part is related to Google. Sorry about the confusion. Believe it or not, most of us root users keep SELinux in it's Enforcing state. This means we are safe. Nothing gets root rights without us knowing. Our phones are just as safe if not safer than most stock phones. JATIN BANSAL SafetyNet test can be passed using Magisk Manager. I am using it and it works fine for me. Even in play store, my device is certified. May be this helps someone. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/3756499ff5876545740cd0e88e38961bb2c327d90fc43f5801f4bce5d802c990.png https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/44185f640490cb506a68a3414579bd345123f7d52ee2e11802d31d5141db11ae.png Nick Most people are worried about the future when the exploits that Magisk uses are patched and it continues to make it harder for people to get around this. JATIN BANSAL That's what I am also worried about. I just posted this for those who are already rooted and for now want to keep the root. My main purpose of rooting was to flash lineage OS. I think custom rom is the only way of staying updated to latest version of Android as google itself doesn't update their phones after 2 years (18 months I think) for reasons they have. I think if someone buys a flagship device which costs 700$+, it should have 3-4 years of full software update support. 😆😄 2 years of major OS version updates and 3 years of security patches. After 3 years, its time to buy a new phone cuz its so old anyway. trparky Says you! Windows 7 was released on July 22, 2009 and they still support it EIGHT YEARS LATER! And they plan on supporting it until the year 2020 which means it will be supported for a total of ELEVEN YEARS! If Microsoft can do it, Google can too!!! Does Microsoft suddenly say "Your machine is too old, go buy a new one"? No, they continue to give you Windows Updates for years later. We should also be demanding that the Android OEMs do so as well. A Samsung Note 5 has more than enough hardware in it to run Android 7 but no... we can't do that, we need to make money so we don't update them to force you to buy a new device. Lambdadelta Magisk...alright, thanks for the tip-off. I really must get it. TadMSTR Magisk doesn't always pass SafetyNet. I have some devices it fails on. However, several other devices it works just fine. Make sure you turn on the hide root option, it's off by default. Lambdadelta Well, I do have a problem, and that is my device is not able to download it directly from Google Play, so I have to get the APK from XDA. I dunno why this is the case for my phone though. Is it because it's a 4.4.4? Either way, I'll get the APK moved to my phone later tonight. Teodor Axel Johan Jönsson I have activated hide root option, and it passes SafetyNet, but in Google Play Store, it still shows uncertified. What app should I hide root from to get Play Store to show Certified? JATIN BANSAL As per XDA: Q: Safety Net fails after enabling MagiskHide A: Magisk can only hide Magisk core features, for Magisk modules it depends on what the module does. If your ROM itself is not able to pass SafetyNet, then there is nothing Magisk can help. Your best bet is 100% stock ROMs, because your phone manufacturer is forced to release a device passing CTS. Teodor Axel Johan Jönsson What in Magisk Hide did you check/how did you do it? Google Play Store? Or Play services? Because here it says uncertified :( JATIN BANSAL Just clear app data of play store. Now it will show your device certified Teodor Axel Johan Jönsson Thanks! Muzaffar I believe that root and custom rom makes android what it is now. This feels like betrayal for Android enthusiast. username_not_valid Well maybe in the very early days (maybe), but not any more. Rooted phones make up a tiny fraction of active devices. Muzaffar It's not about active devices. It's about how android develop together with community (well as i remember) I believe that those "rooted user" contribute many things that make android right now. I still remember status bar (and nav bar) color change was implemented on Kitkat before it becomes official on lollipop. Also, we can't forget how badly mobile active network bug happens in lollipop if it's not those "rooted user" who found out the fix via xposed. and i believe there are still more. trparky We can blame the OEMs for that kind of stuff because of things like locked bootloaders, eFuses, etc. username_not_valid Or we can blame ROM makers for it because they kept breaking the devices causing warranty claims. Naxx ENVY no offence but that's small thinking ... i'd say 90% of people on Android devices don't want or even know about root, heck it may even be 95% ... security is more of a concern, sure it annoys us geeks, but that's the 5% at most. Muzaffar And about half of android devices is left outdated. Not to mention bugs that unsolved on previous android. I'll pick a dumb phone instead, if android becomes a closed platform. trparky And truth be told that's why I have an iPhone. I simply got sick and tired of the lack of updates so I told myself I'm going to the iPhone and have been happy ever since. OK sure, it may not have all of the customization features that Android has but I can be guaranteed that I will get software and security updates on time, every time, regardless of my carrier of choice. refthemc I think you misread his comment, he's saying that root and custom roms got Android to where it is TODAY not saying that it is necessary TODAY. And I agree. trparky It pretty much comes down to this. Google is simply targeting a much larger piece of the pie. You can't blame them for trying to do what is necessary to protect not only the platform but the Android brand itself. Qwip Well, it isn't like there is anywhere else to go though, is it? Google can basically throw enthusiasts who have promoted and fostered android development under the bus - they don't need them any more. trparky Money trumps community. Always has, always will. username_not_valid Ad blocking was the last holdout reason to root for me, but even thats no longer a good reason with things like Adhell, Adguard etc I have no other reason to root now, custom ROMs are generally garbage, and bloat can usually be uninstalled or disabled, so its just not needed. Adonis K. custom ROMs have nothing to do with root... thevigilante Custom ROMs have uncertified flag in Play Store Mike Avellanosa Not all, though George Byers My Nexus 7 2013 is passing safteynet running Lineage unrooted. Wilton Daniel Pinto Let me guess, you have a Pixel. Or you wouldn't call custom ROMs bloated while the reality is other way round username_not_valid Wouldn't touch a Pixel actually. username_not_valid Should be noted that I didn't call custom ROMs bloated, I guess you misread it. Wilton Daniel Pinto Oh yeah, I misread it . My bad Zach Mauch This is going to cause the same problem I see in governments work with security. They will blindly block things like root and bootloader unlock regardless of if it poses any credible threat because it FEELS more secure. Blah!!!!!! Naxx ENVY it IS more secure, not just " feels" h4rr4r More secure for them, not for me the owner of the device. Besides, not even for them in the long term. An up to date ROM has many exploits patched that a two versions out of date and 12 months behind on security patches OTA has. Zach Mauch What I mean is they will apply restrictions because they easily can and it gives a warm fuzzy for them. They will do this regardless of the impact to the user. The analogy here is that in my job I am constantly unnecessary restrictions and bureaucracy that make doing my job much more difficult. For instance, we are disallowed from using remote desktop on standalone computer networks. It would make our job MUCH MUCH easier in many circumstances and save money on software as I could remote into my PC from anywhere in the building. Yet they deny us that and claim security. jonzey231 So this will force people to install apps from unauthorized sources, thus making the whole Android malware issue that much more prevalent. Great.. Suicide_Note Unless being held at gunpoint, no one is forced to install apps from unauthorized sources. That's a user's CHOICE. jonzey231 You know what I mean. Stop playing devil's advocate on everyone's posts. Eric Braun He's not incorrect. Kyle R Krcmaric "Stop providing an alternate viewpoint to my own." It's just comments. Anyway, I think Google also announced that even sideloaded apps will get scanned by their new Google Play Protect service, which may help nullify the risk of sideloading in the first place. d0x360 That's not an alternate viewpoint unless your view is "don't install any apps ever" There is no logical argument to defend this move by Google. None. username_not_valid Yes there is. Come content creators will not allow a provider to support a rooted or otherwise compromised device. Right or wrong in your eyes thats the reality, and in order for Android to be able to have such services Google have to do this. d0x360 What you said isn't an alternate viewpoint lol you are just repeating the reason Google is doing this which everyone agrees is a fact. As for this new comment...a rooted phone isn't compromised. Tell me...what would a rooted user do with Netflix that would make Netflix want to block them? Are they worried about people copying movies because if they think Android is the vector for that action they are idiots. All they are doing is making a problem by allowing bad actors to inject malware into a Netflix apk that could be installed by both root and unrooted users. Genius! Give me 1 good reason to block rooted phones from an app like oh I dunno, Mario run or whatever it's called. Any answers you give are false. Wanna know why? Hacked apks exist to allow cheating and they can be installed by anyone rooted or not. In fact I'd stake my life that your average unrooted user is installing more modified apk files to cheat in games or whatever than any rooted user. People who root are generally better educated about the Android eco system and do less dumb stuff. As for Netflix I cancelled my account on the day they did this and now I just use a friends account so they lost a subscriber due to this move and I rarely ever used the app. Sure 1 person closing an account that's existed since the day they opened isn't going to do much but I vote with my wallet and if a company does something I dislike then they simply don't get my money. The first person I asked gave me their login info and I made a profile. It's just like how I share my HBO subscription with someone else. Easy easy. username_not_valid See my previous comment. Its not for me to argue, the fact is content providers want it, fair or not, end of story, therefore its going to happen. The tiny number of rooters out there are meaningless to them, and Google. Netflix has to do this because the providers of its non-original content demand it. Its not Netflix fault, they either do it or lose shows. Losing large amounts of their content would affect their subscription base several orders of magnitude more than losing rooted users, who chances are, use the service on more than their phone or tablet anyway. d0x360 Once again I ask... what about a rooted device is dangerous to an app and also this is now a second question, what makes it compromised? BAlGaInTl Clearly you've made up your mind on the issue, but I'll give it a go. It isn't necessarily the root that is dangerous to an app or vice versa. The compromise comes from other apps/processes that can take advantage of root. If you don't understand that, then you don't understand what root really is. It has a lot of valuable uses, but it can also be dangerous. To address your previous statement, just because it rubs me the wrong way. So your "solution" was to cancel your Netflix account and then steal the content? So clearly, you aren't "actually" affected by the change, because you can still watch Netflix. You do realize that watching their content is also valuable to them and makes them money? If you want to boycott Netflix for their practices, then by all means do. Otherwise, it just comes across as hypocritical IMHO. d0x360 I don't believe I asked you. No I'm not stealing Netflix content, it's being paid for and Netflix has many times in the past encouraged account sharing. Of course they did so in the hopes you would join but they still allow it. I paid my Netflix dues. Day 1 4 disc member, then as soon as it was available I upgraded to the 4k 4 user package. It's not piracy either, I'm not recording or distributing the content. If Netflix wants to dick with me I'll dick with them. I never said this was permanent but I vote with my wallet. Vote cast. I also haven't used Netflix once since that day despite being able to. I've been using Amazon and Microsoft video where I own over 500 movies so you can stuff the whole theft argument. I've bought more content than most and that doesn't include my DVD, Blu-ray, and uhd Blu-ray collection which is well over 1400 movies and TV shows at this point. Your right...I've been rooting since the first Android phone but I totally don't understand the possibilities. My argument is simple. The overwhelming majority of root users don't mess with apps. To hell with that nonsense argument anyways. What is the danger to Netflix? Copying movies? Please...it's a million times easier to do it on a PC. Even windows xp can handle it without issue. Does Netflix and you I suppose really think root users are using the app to steal content? If so how? Show me one forum topic, one article, one modified Netflix apk that allows downloading and bypassing their drm. I'm begging you. Just 1. BAlGaInTl I reviewed the Netflix TOS, and I will agree that you are not stealing. I'll even remove the verbiage from my post. Netflix does not make any such stipulation. They speak only of the "Account Owner" and "Devices." I guess I just assumed that, and that's my bad. As I've said in other posts... It isn't all about Netflix. A large part of it is about their content. They really can't argue that point with providers. You either play by their rules, work to establish new rules, or choose not to carry them. Netflix wants to stay relevant on all platforms. That's the main danger to Netflix. In addition, I shouldn't have to give an example in the wild of an exploit. Just because it is difficult to find doesn't mean it doesn't exist. What if someone else writes an app that uses root to mine user account data from Netflix? Should Netflix not be worried about protecting user data? If that happens, who is responsible for the security and the bad press? Probably not Netflix, but they would certainly be impacted. I checked my app really quick (which is stuck on version 4 because I'm affected). Since Netflix keeps you logged in for convenience (that's spelled out in their terms), a quick look gives my full name, username, phone number, zip code, the brand of payment card, and the last 4 digits of that card. That's quite a bit of information that can easily be gathered by a piece of Malware. Now as I said... Netflix probably wouldn't be liable if a user was compromised because of root. It would certainly be a danger to their business however. Why should the be asked to take that risk? It seems to me that they are approaching this in a realistic manner, and rolling it out in a reasonable way. Would this affect the majority of root users? Probably not. By their nature, root users will find ways around it anyway. The problem is that the impact to Netflix from losing content and/or a compromised app is disproportionate the loss of blocking root users. It's simply a numbers game, and you can't blame Netflix for that. And you certainly can't blame Google who is trying to improve security. username_not_valid Thats not for me to decide, or argue, the fact is the content providers have decided that rooting is a risk to their copyrighted content, and as such services like Netflix, Amazon, and other streaming services must comply and lock out rooted devices. Passing safetynet and using Googles DRM framework is the easiest way to claim due diligence, so thats what they will do, and in order to keep Android competitive Google is providing the tools needed to make it possible. What I will argue though is that your notion that custom ROMs etc are more secure is unfounded. The best might well be, but there are hundreds of completely random and unchecked ROMs out there that could contain absolutely anything, you cant possibly claim that custom ROMs are inherently safer or more secure than OEM ROMs, outdated or not. jonzey231 So let's play this out: If someone takes the Netflix .apk and mods it with malware and then signs it, it will pass installation on the device. 1. User opens app. 2. App does whatever shitty thing it's designed to do while the user thinks they just got around the block. 3. The OS scans the app and warns the user it's been modified and they should uninstall it. 4. User thinks "Ha! I know and that's why it works!" 5. User keeps app until they get a call from Credit Karma that their identity was probably stolen but they don't know how. 6. Person spends 6 months fixing stolen identity. But still uses that app the whole time. Ultimately, that user is still going to be screwed. Would you or I make this mistake? No. Would your cousin's friend's dad because he had his son root so he could tether for free and overheard you guys talking about sideloading apps and googled how to do it? Yes. Randroid Problem is, even in your scenario, root has nothing to do with it. Someone who is not rooted could do the same thing. The only problem is, now MORE people who root are going to be *forced* to look for a modified apk because the official apk is not available from the Play Store. So in the end, it's causing more problems than it's fixing. Corbin Baxter Here's the thing about rooting: when you alter your devices software like that, then Google shouldn't be responsible for anything that comes afterwards for the user. This just helps discourage rooting, which can alter a new users perspective on Android, or make someone reconsider getting an Android device. someone755 For what it's worth, back in 2011/2010, many of us bought into Android *because* we could root. Imagine the possibilities of being in control of so much more of your system than with any mobile OS prior; We've spent hundreds (some, thousands) of dollars in this environment, on devices, apps, books etc. I understand this isn't how things stand nowadays, but root is still prevalent because of one issue that Google will not fix (or at least, won't until O+ is running on the majority of devices, but that'll take two years at the minimum), and those are updates and vendor apps (i.e. bloatware). If my phone is stuck on Lollipop I'm going to root it; I'll be able to mitigate the memory leak performance drops, and overall customize the device to fit my specific needs -- I've made quite a few friends (think ROM and kernel devs) because I just wanted to put a thermal engine better than Qualcomm's horrendous MPDecision into the kernel directly (i.e. I took the kernel source and modified it to fit my needs). What Google is trying to do here is, yes, discourage rooting, but instead of fixing the root cause (heh) behind why people root in the first place (that is, again, customizability and personal(ized) performance tuning, in large part to keep devices on older Android versions alive), root wouldn't be necessary. In the long run this *might* fix the symptom, but it most definitely will not help in fixing the cause. And that's because the cause is Google itself. As if apps like Snapchat blocking power users from their apps wasn't enough, now there's this -- If it becomes so common that even Google's own apps start to utilize the feature, I'll be gone to another mobile platform within a month. That might mean iOS, it might mean S60v3, I'll know that if (or rather, when) it happens. tl;dr: Google is putting a band-aid on a shotgun wound. Corbin Baxter I'm speaking mainly for new Android users. They don't feel as comfortable rooting. Doing this makes Android SEEM more like iOS. This doesn't MAKE Android like iOS. New users are comfortable with that. This is the same issue Microsoft had with Windows 8/8.1. Classic users, and Windows enthusiasts, hated someone changing the way they would use their computers. Microsoft introduced a different way of doing things, and to enthusiasts, it was bad, no matter how good it might be. Google's Project Treble should mostly fix the fragmentation problem, therefore giving Android users one less reason to root. To us enthusiasts, nothing can beat rooting, but it might not be the best solution to the problems Android has. Google seems intent on fixing the problems rooting tries to solve, but in a higher-quality and reliable way. No hard feelings😉 trparky They won't understand that, they're too blinded by their geek rose colored glasses. Corbin Baxter I don't expect everyone to understand, but I'll be happy if even a small handful understand what Google is doing here. Dmitri Smirnov > when you alter your devices software like that, then Google shouldn't be responsible for anything that comes afterwards for the user. As if right now Google or the OEMs are in any ways responsible for the malware or unpatched firmware vulnerabilities that stay this way for year. But yes, the users that root are the problem. Corbin Baxter For unrooted phones, yes Google and OEMs are very responsible. But after you root, Android loses most of its security and stability, and rooting is basically tinkering with core system files. Google doesn't have any control over what the user can or can't do after that. bekifft That wasn't even a devil's advocate, that was a straight up strawman. Frosted Butts Yes.. please tell me about all the Netflix alternatives i can install, that can legally stream from Netflix...... Right now, if i am rooted and want Netflix (a service i am paying for), i must go through 3rd party app stores to install the APK. There is no choice at all... R Firestone ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ Umm you have the choice to unroot your device. Maxr1998 ..which is a bad choice for many. d0x360 Yes you do except I rooted my device to make it MORE secure. Unrooting would make my device less secure than sideloading apps would. username_not_valid People can keep saying that, but the content providers have no way to know whether or not you have taken measures to secure your custom device, whereas if they go down this root they know its handled. BAlGaInTl "whereas if they go down this root they know its handled" I see what you did there. 😆😄 ...or just watch Netflix from Chrome! You could even do this from a Linux box with root! 😃 Suicide_Note Sure there is: unroot. Problem solved. neoKushan "I've solved this problem by creating 3 more problems - but it IS solved!" Eric Braun https://www.amazon.com/Netflix-Inc/dp/B005ZXWMUS Option C .. ?? h4rr4r A choice that is now more popular. dcdttu It's not so much about what a user chooses to do. It's about probability. The probability that sites are going to try to lure users into downloading malware-infected Netflix APKs from 3rd party sites is going to go up if you can't download it from a safe source in the first place. This is just like the fact that, if you don't give drug users a safe and clean place to shoot up, they're going to go do it somewhere else that's much more dangerous. Both of these scenarios are bad for society in general, no matter what the original intention was. kgptzac 1/10. Gotta try harder. Premsuraj How? Google Play Protect will still catch malicious apps makapav Yes but you're potentially making people venture through shady sites to get the APKs. Eric Braun Or to Amazons App store or Fdroid. The people going to shady sites are already going there, this isn't going to increase the traffic by any real amount. tehboogieman Are you sure that Google will continue allowing GPP for unlocked or rooted users going forward? Not to mention that it's not a silver bullet for 0days d0x360 It barely works as is. There are tons of apps that slip through every day. Krebs on security reports on them quite frequently. I don't trust Google's scanning of apps at all which is why I root. I can make my phone more secure and I can also image the device as often as I want so if something does happen it's fixed within 5 min. If I unroot then I lose the protection along with the backups. Premsuraj Custom ROMs and root can't protect from 0days either. And just out of curiosity how is root going to provide more security? If anything it makes the device less secure tehboogieman Nobody said root makes a device more secure. Blocking root users from downloading apps from the Play Store puts users at more risk since those users will be more inclined to sideload apps from sources that might not be as reliable as the Play Store. Premsuraj The only people who cares about this are the people who root. And those user's generally tend to be more knowledgeable about what kind of apps and app stores they can trust. ASYOUTHIA✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ And only <2% of users will do this to keep rooted. xxTheGoDxx Only the plus 50 - 100 Million users that have root: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=eu.chainfire.supersu ASYOUTHIA✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ You do realize that that's just downloads right? ...not active users. blindexecutioner I'm not mad. I continue to use things like magisk to help get around stuff like this. All this will do is encourage me to use unauthorized sources for offending apps if magisk ever stops working. There is a reason I use Android over iOS and it certainly isn't because the apps are better designed or whatever. brian. Magisk is a good way around this. However, I don't know how long this will last. I would think with security in mind and developers trying to monetize more, it will put pressure on Google to make SafetyNet get triggered much easier. Obviously, I don't have any way of knowing, but this could easily turn into a cat and mouse game more than it already is. Android Pay was first, other apps did it like Super Mario Run, which who cares, but now Netflix? Changes are coming, and it doesn't look good for the rooting community. D13H4RD2L1V3 I'm not sure if everyone gets why some of us went through the trouble of gaining SU access. Sure, maybe there's a few who went through all that trouble for nefarious purposes (and maybe that got regulatory bodies concerned to the point where Google even needed to consider this) but from my perspective at least, a lot of us gain Superuser access mainly to get features that we liked on other Android flavors, especially in the case of a build of Android that's very close to Google's vision. Such as the ability to hide the navbar at any time we wanted and also to gain theming support (which I feel should be added officially sooner rather than later because I absolutely hate how Google is making their already-bright UI even more eye-searing with even more white-colored elements, which also makes the benefits of OLED much less obvious). I wouldn't be as concerned if these features were pushed to AOSP soon, but as it stands, I feel that Google should probably think about making these features available soon. Marty Thank the bad apples for why you no longer have freedom. Jeremy ディリマ Would changing region firmware with Odin flag the SafetyNet check on Samsung mobiles? Soz if it's a stupid question a lot has changed since I last fiddled with Android Christopher Robert This was a long time coming. Once root user started using root to pirate software, and/or get around geo locks, instead of using it to add feature to their firmware or improve their devices performance, it was only a matter of time before it all got torn down. h4rr4r Get around geo locks? You mean have my device report the location I want it to report? Yeah, how terrible that I control what my computer does. dizel123 You still do. This doesn't affect that at all h4rr4r You said the justification for that was people using their devices for their own reasons in the way they liked. I was pointing out that this is a normal thing and not something that should be punished. Cuvis You don't need root to pirate. You never did. Marty Apple says, Thank you. h4rr4r Sounds like we need a new FREE platform. Maybe Amazon can use this to push their store. mxwp but will the Netflix from the Amazon App Store work on rooted phones? Curt RIP Root. I'm not moving from stock anymore, just cab with the hassle. Until there's a 'reliable' way to hide from Safety Net, I'll enjoy my Android Pay, banking apps and overall smoothness. (If it was up to me, I'd be rooted with Linage) h4rr4r IOS is the platform for you. That was the deal from the beginning. hp-fourtwenty magisk....giyf .y phone is rooted with lineage 14.1, and passes safetynet. problem solved! jcopernicus Fantastic news. Lawstorant All this butthurt for what? You all sound like Magisk doesn't exist. Dave Hamilton Lets take Apple and there closed source. Lets take Google and there open source, the freedom to do and change as you please to make the device yours. No two devices have to be the same. Lets get 115 million android users, and then start deciding you no longer have this choice and freedom to do what you want! When something gets better and better, its only a matter of time before all the things you love are removed and comersilised Eric Braun You still have the option to do what you want. However like everything there are reactions for every action. Want to root or unlock your device? Sure, however there may be a few apps that no longer appear in the playstore. May want to have a backup like Amazon App Store or something similar ready. No one is stopping you, feel free to do as you please. tehboogieman Man, if I have to choose between having a device with root or a device with apps that use day to day, the iPhone goes from a 1% chance of being my daily driver to about 50% There are still a lot that can Android can do that iOS can't, but if I'm living in a walled garden the iPhone is looking pretty attractive. 5+ years of official OS support, solid retail network for quick service or hardware exchanges. The Play Store is my main source of apps that I know are vetted and generally safe. I have no desire to manage app updates manually. There is always a chance that someone will build and maintain an appstore that will have all root blocked apps (maybe the future of APKMirror?). If not it might be the death of Android for users like me Eric Braun Even without all of this I would use an APKMirror App that allowed for updating of apps automatically. dizel123 Google gives app developers more control over their apps. Whiny entitled internet crybabies go on the internet and whine and cry. Aka...Thursday neoKushan Alternatively: Google restricts users from using their device, which they own, how they see fit. dizel123 Except Google isn't restricting anyone from doing anything. But being 100% wrong has never stopped anyone in the internet NubCake being an asshole (in your case) hasn't stopped anyone from commenting eather it seems. dizel123 I can admit to being an asshole. But I'm also right so it's all good. neoKushan It's certainly not stopping you. dizel123 I haven't experienced it so of course it's not stopping me trparky You may own the hardware but you don't own the software, you only have a license to use it. Csöpi Thats so greate. I have a stock oneplus one and for some strange reasons i was failing the test beforhand, but now its all green. Still cant update the netflix app hence chromecast isnt working either anymore. Not really happy. JC If there's a will there's a way. brian. If more developers get on board with this, I can't see why I would switch to Android. I've always been curious about new Android phones, bought a bunch and rooted them all if I could. This is not good for a person like me. d0x360 If Google keeps this up and app devs include the api to block rooted phones then my days using Android will be over and Google will have lost a user who's been there since the g1. I don't know what I'd switch to... probably windows mobile because I'm not a fan of apple whatsoever. It's really a shame because if I had to guess I'd say 99.99% of people who root do so for either the added security and or customized experiences. For example I use root to modify my status bar and quick panel as well as firewall my apps and use adaway and yes Google I do whitelist sites that aren't obnoxious with their ads. John Doe All the more reason for the APK mirror appstore LoL Jan-Lk Else Yeah Google want's us to buy tooooo expensive phones to just get the latest Android, because cheap phones suck at updates and so they need to be flashed and rooted... trparky But if the community raises holy hell with the OEMs then maybe it will be corrected. There's no damn reason why a three year old device can't be updated when an eight year old Windows 7 machine is still receiving Windows Updates. McStagger WHY DOES NETFLIX CARE IF THE PHONE IS ROOTED?!?!?!?! mxwp Netflix does not care, but the content creators that make the stuff you see on Netflix do care. They care because they are idiots who think it is easier to pirate from rooted phones. bekifft Again, Google becomes more and more restrictive. I switched from iPhone because the screens were too small, and Google was far less restrictive. Both of those issues are now resolved, and Google's upped the price of their device to match Apple. May as well switch back to iPhone, Google seems to support it just as much as Android anyway. Luxferro Except it's not just rooted users! Any device with an unlocked bootloader. hp-fourtwenty Your comment sucks for misinforming users about what safetynet is....has NOTHING to do with unlocked bootloaders. Luxferro Sure it does. My Nexus 6P only has an unlocked bootloader, and Netflix disappeared from the play store after the last update. And I'm not the only one, so I suggest you do some reading. TechGuy22 more reason for me to pirate hey, have at it Matías Duarte I hope Netflix does the same with Jailbroken iOS devices. Why they do this btw? To prevent people recording their movies? You can do that with Windows.. Knowledgeborn Allah In all honesty, that'll probably never happen. Jailbreaking iOS opens the doors to a lot of customization on an iPhone, but the security issues are often minimal (with the exception being not having the latest software version). Jailbreaking is pretty much filtered through the Cydia platform. You don't have access to the entire system with a jailbreak. Rooting is completely different, because you can completely reshape the core OS. fbl Note : I don't work for Netflix so I can't comment for them. Possible causes : - the right holders might be pushing for this. I work on roughly the same product area and we don't implement DRM because we like them, we implement them because we contractually have to. -Netflix is tired of getting low notes because of crashes coming by shitty hacks in custom roms. Zach Mauch Anyone know how chromebooks will be affected by this? Will dev mode being enabled cause you to fail SafetyNet Checks? That is currently the only way to install apks on Chromebooks. Branko But Android AOSP!11 -Google 2011 How the times how changed. Wayne Randall ALT arguement, because I don't have time to read every comment... This doesn't limit me and my rooted N6P at all, this move limits how much money they (the devs and Google) are going to make. I can't buy it (the app or coins, or special characters, or bonus content, w/e) if I can't see it. Plain and simple. The important apps will still be there. No app is worth unroot. Block Project Fi from root though... weeeellll. I guess I'd unroot for that. mxwp yeah, only Netflix, banks, and big names will use these blocks. i am guessing most devs want as much exposure as possible. PVL_93_RU Google is actively trying to kill the modding community. Not the Custom ROM makers, but people who root and install Xposed. All because they compromise the security for Android Pay I fear the day root and Xposed apps start disappearing from the Play Store trparky If it comes to security vs being open, security will always win (or at least should always win). Eric Koop I had my Shaw Gateway app update yesterday and they changed it so it doesn't work if rooted. So I had to uninstall and find an APK online of an older version. Now it's just a matter of time before I forget and re-install the update. What a pain... disqus_em5YfkbWdk Well this would certainly get me to cancel Netflix. My personal Plex server is far better than Netflix could ever be anyway. Vivek Rameses Becoming apple more and more every day. Disgusting. Knowledgeborn Allah Android is starting to look more and more like iOS with each update... ¯_(ツ)_/¯ trparky Open platforms rarely stay open once the Benjamins start rolling in. hp-fourtwenty Go ahead and block me...I'll just pirate your app. Play nice and so will I. Start poking me and I'll poke back by never giving you another penny. App devs can't beat XDA devs. It's not going to happen. My unlocked, rooted, rommed and modded device still passes safety net. The day that stops, so does the flow of money leaving my hands on the play store. Luxferro Lay off the sodas.... UniBroW Question, can those of you without access to Netflix on Google play, can it be installed from the Amazon App Store? Stanley C. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/dd381b7e8a39df74c4725712a0db906098c965e9ee4194b6e01e020fd69ee566.png Thats how magisk is made... Magic! Marti Abernathey Yawn. I've got a rooted device and just installed Netflix... because? Magisk. As soon as they made this choice I cancelled. Not because I can't get around it, but because they make me do that. mrjayviper even on a non-rooted LOS mis 5s+, I cannot install Netflix. unlocking the bootloader already tripped safety. And I don't want to root. The features available in non-rooted LOS is enough for me. Teh BuG No. Bueno. TedPhillips Sigh. What's the over-under on this becoming pervasive in the play store... MicroG / Fdroid I'm coming soon. World needs a solid single alternative gcm replacement to catch on. TedPhillips As far as the potential for support overhead, being rooted is generally less than the pain coming from the Xposed/magisk crowd. You need to be actively interfering with an app via root vs code being injected into low levels of the framework that everything uses. TedPhillips I think the best outcome could be that Google opens up their process for little guys to certify there own rom builds, ala let's encrypt lowering friction on getting ssl setup. AOSP should not be a functionally useless base implementation for I'm roms, but something you can use in​ practice. TedPhillips Hey guys, don't worry. Google says Android is for everyone. https://www.android.com/everyone/ That includes AOSP developers too, right? That website seems to tread the line pretty carefully, ala 'no one is forcing you use Google play' but Hiroshi's quote seems like it comes with a grain of salt since he owns Play. I'd love to see AP interview him about this. qkjDlav As an app developer for a large app used globally, the two biggest time wasters in a developer's life are a) debugging device specific issues (HTC, Samsung, etc) and b) crash logs with Xposed in the stack trace. Developers are tired of having to sit around with device farms at their desks just to make sure new features and changes work with each quirky variant of Android that manufacturers want to deploy, and custom roms do make it worse. Enthusiasts are welcome to customize their own versions of Android and sideload apps, but we don't want to see crashlogs in the Developer Console from rooted/custom ROM users. And companies probably don't want to keep paying us to debug issues that only a small minority of users will see. Lê Nguyên Chương Most stupid thing I've ever heard in my life.

Netflix was just the start: Google Play Console lets developers exclude app availability for devices that don't pass SafetyNet Rita El Khoury Follow View All Posts 2017/05/18 3:57am PDTMay 18, 2017 93 Plus 1 on G+ 108 Share on Facebook 82 Share on Twitter Total Shares283 Google News Last weekend, a huge turmoil swept the root-enthusiast Android community as it was discovered then confirmed that the Netflix app was being blocked from showing up in search results on the Play Store for rooted devices. At the time, Netflix said it was using Widevine to block unsupported devices, but that made no sense to us: the app was still functional if it was sideloaded, it was only not showing up as compatible in the Play Store. So what sorcery was Netflix really using?! Turns out it's a new function of the Google Play Console. As part of the updates announced for the Play Console at I/O 2017, Google mentions a new Device Catalog section under Release management that lets developers choose with intricate granularity which devices their app supports on the Play Store. Devices can be viewed and excluded by many attributes including RAM and SoC, but the important factor we're interested in is SafetyNet Attestation. New "Device catalog" lets devs manage the exclusions. Developers will be able to choose from 3 states shown in the top image: not excluding devices based on SafetyNet, excluding those that don't pass integrity, or excluding the latter plus those that aren't certified by Google. That means any dev could potentially block their apps from showing and being directly installable in the Play Store on devices that are rooted and/or running a custom ROM, as well as on emulators and uncertified devices (think Meizu and its not-so-legal way of getting Play Services and the Play Store on its phones). This is exactly what many of you were afraid would happen after the Play Store app started surfacing a Device certification status. This is different from the full SafetyNet API implementation that apps like Android Pay and Pokémon Go use. In the case of Pay/Go, the attestation check happens when the app is installed on your phone and doesn't allow it to run unless it passes the integrity test. But in the case of the Play Console, the attestation check happens when you're browsing the Play Store and only affects the availability of the app for your device. If the full SafetyNet API isn't included in the app itself, you will still be able to grab the APK from other sources, install it, and the app will work just fine. Still, this spells trouble for rooted users and the Android enthusiast community as a whole. Google keeps erecting more and more obstacles each day in the face of root and custom ROMs and even if this won't stop root users who should be knowledgable enough to know how/where to grab an APK and install it, it will make things more and more difficult and maybe less and less worth the trouble. But y'all are rebels and you'll keep on finding a way around it, won't you?

Nice move Google. Suicide_Note Not sure if serious, but either way, this was just a matter of time. YouNex Obviously not serious EowynCarter So, question : Is there anyway to get android O in the future on my nexus 6 and not having problems with this ? IF manufacturer where taking care of updating their devices, wouldn't be an issue... saf1927 If Magisk keeps working, yep. You can. Even my old Nexus 5 is on 7.1.2 and it passes SafetyNet. EowynCarter I want "just work" stuff. Not workaround. Maybe Magisk does the job for some, but not an acceptable solution from my point of view. Mainly the "we don't know if it will keep on working" part. saf1927 Well, it's the best solution so far and it has improved a lot since its inception. I never bothered since the Nexus 5 was a secondary device for me, but now that some apps won't show up anymore on the Play Store, I simply flashed Magisk and that's about it. I haven't tweaked anything. Plus, if you are already flashing a custom ROM, flashing an extra zip file isn't that much work anyway. EowynCarter True, but it's the phone I use dailly. I don't want apps sudendly not working, becasue google decided to push an update that broke magisk. mxwp well if you want things to "just work" then i guess get an iPhone EowynCarter Sadly, I'm beginning to think about that. But that would cause others frustrations. ED-Zが現れた! Well, people will just flock to root-supported apps... Milton P. I actually forgot when was the last time I Rooted a device. No biggie. Suicide_Note The bad thing is it isn't just root that causes problems. Simply unlocking the bootloader will produce the same result. Maxr1998 Just because it's no biggie for you, it doesn't mean everyone approves this. I am actually pretty concerned, because this limits the freedom over our devices even more.. Milton P. Define freedom, please. Maxr1998 Software freedom, to be more specific. You should have the freedom to use and modify your device and it's software however you'd like, and have fill control over it. That means, root access. And since the AOSP core IS free software, the 4 freedoms defined by Richard Stallman apply to it. What this change now introduces is that you're forced to decide between either giving up the freedom over your device or not using the app you wanted to download (which will probably have to be my choice, and that sucks). Milton P. But you're not giving up anything, you just have to make a choice. If you put that way, Google has the freedom of doing with the AOSP core whatever they want, the same way you can modify said core and do as you please, the difference is Google has more money and more responsibilities when it comes to their user base. XDA and other sites will still have a bunch of developers making whatever they please (within the AOSP terms) with the AOSP core. This will just change thinks for the people that use those ROMs bit realistically the vast majority of users won't feel the changes. Sad but true. h4rr4r That choice is giving up freedom you had before. The vast majority will see the rate of Android improvements slow as the Devs on XDA and the like lose interest. Android only exists because of Linux, now it is turning its back on that whole culture. Milton P. Well, I don't see your freedom compromised to be honest with you, but we're seeing things from different angles so that's that. Sorry for your loss in that case. h4rr4r You do not think losing control of your device is a loss of freedom? Milton P. Nope, is just a device, I have more important stuff going on, m device is a tool the same way a hammer is a tool, you can buy a hammer and use it as it is. Sometimes my device is a toy, if I buy a remote control car I'll modify it as long as it is possible, the same way I modify my phone. I have control over my phone. I can install whatever I want at my own risk. If I decide to root my phone I expect things to be broken. I remember when I had an HTC and I hated sense so I decided to install a custom ROM, I gave up the camera and I was aware of it. There was always some compromises with custom ROMs, nothing is changing. I rather have a safe device then a compromised one today, still my choice thou. h4rr4r So you want IOS. Got it. Over here I want freedom. I don't think homedepot should be allowed to tell me what I can hit with the hammer I bought. trparky Open platforms rarely stay open once they become popular. Once the Benjamins come rolling in it tends to override open. h4rr4r Tell that to Linus Torvalds. I am sure he will have many many fuck yous for you. trparky Linux is the rare situation. h4rr4r The rare situation like many others that created android and even google. trparky Yeah but look at Android, the walls are closing around it and there's nothing you can do about it. Face it man, the geeks may have built the system but the common man now rules it. Geeks love choice, yes, they do love their choice but your average person doesn't give a rat's ass about choice. All they want is a device that does what they need it to do when they want to do it. They have no inclination to learn how it works or why it works just as long as it does. This is what geeks do not and refuse to understand. h4rr4r Sure there is, stop using it. Then the common folks will have to follow us to the next platform. trparky As long as their is money involved in maintaining Android it doesn't matter if something better comes along, people will continue supporting Android because it makes them money. Money makes the world go round, get used to it. Maxr1998 ^ What @h4rr4r:disqus says. trparky Yep. The root and ROM community is such a small portion of the Android ecosystem that they really don't matter to them. People have been screaming at Google for years to get the Android house fixed up, this is them doing just that. You can't blame them for doing what the people have asked for. mxwp I agree with you, but sadly you only have freedom over hardware. You can do what you want with the device you buy. But with software you never actually buy it... you only buy a license to use it. Thus you have no real freedom with software. Maxr1998 Android is free software, Apache 2.0 license. At least the AOSP part of it. trparky But the Google parts of it are not covered under the Apache 2.0 license. That's essentially why ROM developers can't package the Google Play Services pack with the ROM itself and instead requires you to download a separate ZIP package from Google to install it separate from the ROM package. Android itself may be free and open but the Google Play Services part is not. Sudev There are far more than few arguments against root access but here are some: Root access is meant for experimental & development purpose and not for Daily Driver for any average user of the platform. Google Play Services & Apps available on Play Store are not "Free Software". Google as provider of Play Services infrastructure has much more liabilities then one can simply assume. And also the app developers have responsibility to protect end users' data. If device has root access available and any rouge app / maleware steals other apps data which is possible, who will be at stack? h4rr4r The ability to do anything I want with my things that I own. Milton P. You​ can do whatever you want with your device, nobody is stopping you. You might see that some apps are not showing up in the play store but you can still side load them, I still see freedom in your future. h4rr4r For how much longer? Soon these apps will ask play services if they are supposed to be installed on that device, at that point you can say goodbye to sideloading. If this is what people want then IOS was the platform for them. thecoolkid Ok Google, define freedom... 😁 Nick I would imagine a great deal of people on this site will be upset, but in actuality I don't think this will affect the user base of many apps that badly h4rr4r Not in the short term. However in the long term it will. Android only exists because of the FREE software movement. Nick Yes, but that doesn't apply to applications, which this is about. h4rr4r Think long term. Same thing applies. trparky No it won't because the root and ROM community is so small it doesn't matter to Google anymore. The 95% of people who simply want a device that works don't care and likely won't ever care. As long as they can play NetFlix, Pokemon Go, or whatever is the next craze they don't care. h4rr4r Again, that is short term thinking. Think past the end of your nose. Android exists because of linux. Google needs this small group to create the very stuff they rely on. trparky You overestimate the value that the community has now. Android may have needed the community back in the beginning to gain the foothold that it has in the market but not so anymore. Android has near 100% market penetration, they have achieved world domination. They don't need the community anymore, they have achieved their goals. h4rr4r Until they are unseated. IBM once had a monopoly on computing devices. They did not need the community to gain a foothold, they would not have a product to gain a foothold without the community. Android only exists because of a collection of those projects. trparky No, Android exists because Samsung, HTC, and LG make devices people want and it makes them money by the semi-truck full. The community doesn't mean shit now, all that matters to these companies is one thing... money, money, and more money. Oh, and did I mention money? This is capitalism man, money rules the world. If you don't make money you are dead. h4rr4r Please tell me how that would have happened without linux. Money loses to good engineering every day. Look at how linux killed solaris. trparky Tell me why Windows is the defacto monopoly on the desktop despite the fact that Linux is better in every damn way possible under the hood? That's right... money. h4rr4r Because the desktop is dead. The fight is over. They lost. Even money can't keep them relevant. trparky Oh, you're funny. The desktop is not dead, it will never be dead. When people need to do real work, they sit down at a desktop. When people want to play real games, they sit down at a desktop. When people need to type out anything longer than a page like a college term paper, they sit down at a desktop. The desktop is king and will always be king. Long live the desktop! h4rr4r The Desktop is a dead man walking. When they do real work, they use a Citrix session. When they game they use a console, or they are already nerds. When people type they can use a fucking chromebook. The desktop as you think of it died already. trparky Try and say that shit over at TechPowerUp, HardOCP, Overclock.net, TomsHardware, etc. and trust me when I say this... you'll be run out of town by people with pitchforks and torches. h4rr4r Those are all nerds. Those are the folks who have desktops running 3 different OSes. They are the folks who are pissed about android being locked down. trparky And your point being? You just admitted that only the "nerds" care about Android being open. Sure, those same "nerds" will go off and create a new platform but the rest of the people who are living in the real world and who don't care one damn bit about how it works will continue to use Android. h4rr4r Those people will eventually move to the new platform. Just like they did with Android. trparky And the same thing will happen to that platform in the future that's happening to Android now. Open platforms are nice and all, I'll admit that, but your average person doesn't care one bit. I dare you to go up to any person on the street and ask them anything about Android. What phone do they have? What model? Most will say "I don't know, something that my carrier gave me for cheap." h4rr4r The wheel of computing we call it. It has happened and will happen again. So what? trparky Which reinforces the idea that I said before, eventually all open systems will become closed (or less open) at some point in their life cycle. It usually happens when it becomes popular with the common man. Why? Because like I've been trying to get through your thick skull, the average person doesn't care how any of this stuff works so long as it works. h4rr4r The average person does not matter. Few open systems become closed. AOSP is still fine. trparky What the hell do you mean by "they don't matter"? They're the ones buying the devices, buying the apps, looking at the ads, etc. Just how the fuck does that translate to "they don't matter"? h4rr4r Because they don't. They don't create, they don't cause new things to be created. They are just users, just like I don't matter to how movies are created. trparky But without money from the people who are consuming said things developers won't make new stuff. Developers do have to eat you know and put a roof over their heads. h4rr4r The giant world of FOSS pretty much proves you wrong. Demand cannot create supply. I don't pirate anything kiddo. I have way too much to lose for that. One of those lawsuits I would actually have to pay, since I could. trparky I'll give a hint on how FOSS works a lot of the time. Some of the top tier Linux kernel developers actually work for companies and they just contribute code in their free time. They may work for Intel, AMD, nVidia, or God knows what but only after their day job is done. Why? Because they need money and they need to eat. This is a basic requirement for people in this world. They need money!!! People don't just write code for the love of it, even Linus Torvalds who's in charge of the Linux kernel itself works for the Linux Foundation and yes, he gets paid for his work to the tune of $10 Million a year. Sorry to burst your bubble man but FOSS projects aren't all happy, happy, joy, joy here... people need to be paid real money to be able to eat, drive a car, put a roof over their heads, etc. On second thought, I'm not sorry I burst your bubble! You need it burst! PEOPLE NEED TO BE PAID REAL FUCKING MONEY!!!! h4rr4r No, they get paid to contribute. During the work day. Not as a hobby. Lots of projects are like that. I won't say exactly how I know about that ;) Their employers just aren't as short sighted as you. Linus did not however create linux to get rich. Great code like great art gets created because it must be. People do what they love. Kid, you will get it one day. When you have enough that you aren't worried about it each day, money stops being that big of a deal. Don't worry everybody goes through a phase like you are now. trparky Dude, we are not the Federation of Planets here living in a happy, happy, joy, joy world in which people can just do whatever they want to do without a care in the world. As long as human greed exists there will always be a need for money. And believe you me, greed will never go away unless we breed a new kind of human and I don't see that happening any time soon. Gene Roddenberry's future will never happen, it just won't. Contrary to a lot of geek dreams it just won't. h4rr4r No idea where you got that idea. Never suggested it. My point was the personal relative value of increasing income drops as income goes up. If you make minimum wage doubling your income is a huge deal. Adding the same amount to my income would not get me to take a job I like less. Offering it to Linus would be a waste of time. Yes, some people will keep chasing dollars, they are the exception not the rule. The employers are working on enlightened self interest. Either they use the FOSS product, gain market advantage with direct knowledge, use it for marketing or believe they are getting something else. PostgreSQL for example has a lot of paid contributors who work for companies that either provide customization, consulting or depend on the project. Others just because it increases quality. Commercial software by and large is not high quality. I have seen a lot of it and 90% if you tried to submit it to a FOSS project of any size would get you denied and possibly mocked. This system continues to be more innovative because it is easy to continue to expand. Anyone with a good idea can fork if their idea is not accepted. trparky > My point was the personal relative value of increasing income drops as income goes up. Tell that to the people in Washington or any CEO that demands ever increasing yearly salaries and end of year bonuses all while raping the companies that they work for. Tell that to the psychopaths on Wall Street. For as long as their is money, people will want more of it. Anyone who says that they don't is flat out lying. h4rr4r Those are the exception not the rule. That is why you call them psychopaths. Honestly, correcting for inflation I really don't care that much if I ever make more. Would it be nice sure, would I give up anything I like about my job? No. If you could double my income but it prevented me from contributing to FOSS projects or owning code I generate off the clock, I would not take that deal. If money was enough to make people do anything MS would have offered Linus $11 million a year to not write it. Heck, Sun would have done it while they were still around. trparky Either you're a child that doesn't know how the adult world works or you're a fucking troll. h4rr4r So you have no idea who makes stuff, neat. I guess you think Henry Ford should have made a faster horse. trparky Oh, I know who makes the stuff I use but I also make sure that they are paid! I give money to those developers who write the programs that I enjoy and if I can't pay them I won't use their programs. I only use a program if I can pay for it. I have put money into their tip jars on their web site, I look for PayPal links and I donate even if it's something small like $5. They deserve it! h4rr4r Good for you! There is a lot of great software that does not make money that way. Some even just ask is that you follow the license, like linux which mediatek steals by not releasing kernel source. So I hope you avoid buying that kind of thing. trparky MediaTek controller chips are known to suck so I don't buy them out of that reason alone. h4rr4r Now I have given you another good reason to avoid them. Bunch of thieves. Rita El Khoury I don't even remember when I last bootloader unlocked. But I know this move toward closing the ecosystem further and further will have ripples in the future. The enthusiast community flocked toward Android for its openness and we have custom ROMs and their enterprising devs to thank for HUNDREDS of new features that they implemented first and everyone clamored for and applauded until they became features in AOSP. If Google thinks it can steer this ship alone and it knows best what to do next, we may have less and less interesting features in the future and more and more of what only one entity thinks is best, not a diverse set of opinions. Nick Given that this only gives the developer the option of requiring these checks, it makes me believe that Google had to do this for some companies that have regulatory or other kinds of requirements. Which is a shame for the rooted (and unlocked?) community, but understandable. Shame Google is most likely going to take the blame here in this comment section though. Rita El Khoury Well, maybe they had to, but that won't stop any developer from implementing it without any regulatory or legal requirement pushing them to do so. Nick Right, which puts this choice on the developer, not Google. Google was stuck behind a rock and hard place, perhaps. EowynCarter Well, google is certainly to blame for not planing to update my nexus 6 to android O. And now I can't even use custom rom as plan B without losing some apps :( Suicide_Note Boo hoo. Buy a new phone and quit crying that Google doesn't support phones forever. EowynCarter Fine can you order a pixel XL and ship it to me in France ? Plus, my nexus 6 still works, I hate having to replace working stuff. Makes no sense, economically and ecologically speaking. Suicide_Note I'll sell you my XL when I'm done with it, but only after i get the Pixel XL 2. :) EowynCarter Well, I do hope Google sells the "pixel 2 "( or whatever its name) here. For now, I'm'just hoping my nexus 6 don't break. Else I might jump on the iOS ship. I'm not convinced the the other android alternatives. Note 8 would be the closest, but touchwiiz, delayed updates.... I'm spoiled after a few years with a nexus. Suicide_Note There always eBay or Swappa if you want to get a first gen Pixel. I was looking at prices over the weekend, and mint condition Pixels are going for about $450. EowynCarter Not so much in France. And eBay for suff that cost more that a few bucks, too risky. Plus, the pixel is getting "old" by now. Wilton Daniel Pinto Troll found trparky Yet Microsoft still supports Windows 7 EIGHT YEARS LATER! How come Microsoft can do that yet Google can't? Alex Louderback Actually, that's Qualcomm EowynCarter Source for this ? trparky And Qualcomm can go fuck themselves. Gee... I wonder why they're being hit with an anti-trust lawsuit. Could this be one of many reasons why? trparky Yes, Google is to blame for that. There's no damn reason why your Nexus 6 can't run Android O other than the fact that they just don't want to. Bojan Bunić My bootloader was unlocked prior to changing the mobo on my 5X, courtesy of Booty Loops. Root, well, probably before I got my Nexus 4. Although I'll see how it'll go on in the future, as we don't have Pixels here, so the only near stock possibility is either OnePlus, or some other device and a custom ROM. Milton P. Agree 100% with you, I mean I remember the old days when I hated HTC's Sense, I literally decided that a phone without a camera was better than whatever HTC did back then, but Android has evolved quite a lot nowadays, don't get me wrong, I do believe that custom ROMs did a great job showing Google what the users want but that won't change, as long as someone shows Google what people want Google will keep improving Android, because there's no limits. Now if they go the Apple way and lock EVERYTHING then we'll be fucked, I'm the meantime developers will find a way around the system pushing Google along. Premsuraj An open bootloader and root actually solves a lot of problems still existing in AOSP. The Nougat update absolutely destoryed the battery life of many Nexus 6P devices, with Google only focussing on the Pixels, there was no fix in it. I unlocked, used Franco Kernel + naptime + Greenify and I now I get adequate battery life. Another feature I can think of is theming. Material design is good, but the whiteness is rage inducing Maxr1998 Well, fuck them. Let's just hope not many devs will use this, and Google won't enable this by default anytime soon. Maxr1998 The more I think about this, the more concerned I get. This will reduce the freedom over our devices, and also limit developers in the awesome things they could do before because of Android's openness. I am all in for device security and fighting against malware, trojans and phishing applications, don't understand me wrong, but that doesn't mean that you have to take people away their freedom - just look at how Linux (GNU and Linux) is doing it. Tom Westrick How does this limit developers? If anything it gives them more control. Maxr1998 Fair point, I should have been more specific. With "developers", I meant rom developers and modders, app developers only if they require root access for their apps. "Normal" developers can use this to enforce a "secure" (read: DRM locked-down) environment, but that's not really a good thing in my opinion.. (Refer to my other comments.) trparky You're angry at the wrong people, you should be angry at Hollywood; they're the ones that are demanding this kind of stuff. Their content, their rules; it's how things are in the real world. They have to do what they need to do to protect their investments, plain and simple. We don't necessarily have to like it, hell... we may even hate it, but that's how it is. You want the content? Play by their rules. Colin Richardson If you are an app developer and want your app to run on custom roms..... don't turn on "Requires SafetyNet"... bekifft We are increasingly living in the future Richard Stallman warned us about. With Google taking all these steps, may as well go back to using jailbroken iPhones. Bart Janusz I've already enabled it and I know at least 3 others devs that did it as well. I really don't care about root per se, but custom roms and xposed is source of countless problem as both are buggy as hell. Maxr1998 But in which way does that influence you? Xposed can introduce bugs to the system, sure, but it won't affect the performance of your app unless it itself is modded, so you probably don't have to fear bad reviews for bad performance anyway. And custom roms? LineageOS on my mother's Moto G runs like a champ and much better than the 5.1 stock rom before. And in my experience as a dev, there were much more incompatibilities with Samsung TouchWiz than with AOSP-based custom roms. refthemc I'm sure he's just trying to avoid the headache of emails he gets daily from users who have no idea that it's their fault the app is not working or crashing... Bart Janusz Indeed, not to mention extra crash and ANRs reports which seems to influence app positioning. Maxr1998 But why? The device may behave more buggy at some parts because of Xposed (and mine definitely ran like shit on MM because of some mods, but I NEVER blamed any apps), but the apps itself won't run worse if not modded - normally they should even run better if you only use performance mods like Greenify, NLP Collector wakelock disabler and other light mods. I don't think he gets many reports anyway, considering what @marcusmarcus2:disqus said. Bart Janusz You may not, but many users do, and as I said there are a lot of bogus ANRs and crash reports. Since my app depends heavily on low level OS elements both custom ROMs and xposed are deal breakers (and you really should check source, since I do not update my website as I moved to G+/FB but app has sizable user base given its niche and I'd to deal with ROM/xposed issues fequently). Maxr1998 Well, but the same type of users also give bad reviews etc. without using any mod or root. You generalize modders to only cause problems, and therefore lock out everyone. About your app/website thing: fair point, I didn't look at it yet, and have to apologize for being a little rude. marcusmarcus2 You need to take your own advice, "you really should check source". If you moved to G+/FB, then why does your app on the play store still point to the same website as well. Or at least put a link on the old website that directs to G+/FB. There is nothing that points to your so called G+/FB source. So @Maxr1998:disqus has no other source to check at the moment. Bart Janusz Not that I care but if you try to draw conclusion about app you should probably visit Play Store listing. Anyhow that's really not important I just chimed in to explain why developer will use this. I've choose to do so due to extra burden which in effect hurts majority of my user base, one of my colleagues cited lucky patcher and freedom (which I think is not such a good idea but its his choice). trparky You may not blame the apps because you know better but most people don't understand that, most people see a crashing app and suddenly you see, as the developer, a ton of comments saying that your app sucks. h4rr4r Please do tell us about your apps so we can be sure to avoid them on any devices we have not yet rooted. marcusmarcus2 His disqus profile leads to this website http://artflowstudio.com/ which has a few apps listed. Art oriented apps. There is only 1 update on that website since 2014, so I don't think I would be to concerned about installing one of his apps. Jordan Palmer Nice detective work. Adrian I can see a lot of refund requests coming from people who paid for apps and suddenly are told "Nope. Not for you anymore." A lot of us are rooted and buy apps and you'd better believe noise will be made if an app I use daily, that I paid for, suddenly breaks with an update because it's no longer blessed by the dev to run on my device. It's your app and you can do what you want with it, but there is always another side to the coin. BAlGaInTl That's not the way that Netflix worked it, and I doubt other developers of paid apps would either. I have a OnePlus One, that I run Lineage OS on since the original Cyanogen OS is now defunct and does not receive any updates. Netflix simply doesn't update to v 5+. It still works just fine. I may not get the newest and latest features, but part of that is on me for using a device that is dated. I'm not one of those users who, because I paid for an app once, fells that I should get all of the updates from now until the end of time. That isn't sustainable for developers. It could very well be that Netflix has some new features/offerings in the works in which they are getting pressure from outside sources to push this. A lot of valid reasons for a developer to enable the check exist. As long as they do it in the same manner that Netflix has, I don't see the issue. Adrian And just like Pokemon Go, eventually you'll get a message that you need to upgrade to the latest version or the app won't work, you know, that new version that won't let you actually log into it anymore. We've already seen this happen so let's not pretend that it isn't the next logical step. They aren't going to keep letting people sign in indefinitely with an app that doesn't have the security level they want. It's naive to think that hey I can just stick with the last version that works for root. It takes all of what, the time it takes to create a switch that says minimum version required to log in is "DRM version" BAlGaInTl Good Point. I recognize that. But it seems that the blame (in general) is being directed at Google in many of these posts. If that scenario happens, it isn't Google that blocked you from accessing Netflix. The need for this level of security is on the increase. The same users demanding better security and longer updates are the first ones to cry foul when Google starts laying the groundwork for exactly what they have asked for. Adrian I think there is a way to do both that doesn't piss off a very active community that helped take Android from a very very very ugly, second class OS to what we have now. I know a lot of us remember just how crippled Android was and it was the root/mod community that produced the bulk of what is now standard on Android. There needs to be a way to secure the devices AND not turn their back on the developer community that contributes. The idea, in Netflix's case, that root = pirate is insane. Why in the world would someone prefer to rip content on their phone to say a computer or XBox that is never going to move and can do it while you get on with your life? They're doing something for the sake of saying they're doing something, but if they think it's going to make a dent in piracy they, and the studios are nuts. I watch a lot of Netflix and still prefer to buy discs. People who do things the right way and are perfectly happy paying for content shouldn't have to jump through hoops to watch it. Those of us who root usually have a handful of things that stock Android is not doing for us. It's why we root. If all of these things were available in stock, my reasons for rooting would disappear but I don't see that happening any time soon. I think Android is getting so much better but if they make it exactly like iOS, might as well go to the dark side because Apple's apps tend to be more polished, come out first and OS updates are frequent. Don't bite the hand that feeds you just because you're getting more popular. BAlGaInTl I think that Netflix is a good example. It is HIGHLY likely that the reason for recent unpopular changes (see also VPN blocking) are being driven by other entities. It isn't that Netflix thinks its a problem, but the people that control a large portion of their content do. root pirate but it does introduce a security risk. I don't see how Google is turning their backs on developers. Developers are free to develop as they see fit and choose (at least for the moment) whether or not they will implement the SafetyNet check. The inherent problem is that a circumvented security is still circumvented and can no longer be considered secure. I can clearly see why some apps would and should frown upon that. Maybe not Netflix and Mario (IMHO), but certainly something like bank and payment apps. I don't think the inherent open nature of android will ever reduce to the level of iOS. But some changes have to occur to meet the needs/desire of the majority. Security is inherently difficult. The easier and more flexible you try to make it, the less secure it becomes. Adrian I do think banking apps should run in a secure space. Completely agree with that, but I disagree with root = less secure. My nexus devices stopped getting OS and security updates. Nothing. VERY insecure and dangerous. I rooted them, updated the OS with images from XDA developers and my devices that were once easy targets are more secure. There is always two sides to it. I see that Google is finally trying to take security seriously on Android and doing things in layers that completely cut out the vendor AND the carriers is the right step. Right now, Root is the only way to update a perfectly good device like my Nexus tablet tablet that the vendor said "oh well" to. Until Google has a REAL strategy in place to keep ALL Android devices secure, root will be necessary. Not everyone wants to or can upgrade devices every two years because they get abandoned. My father doesn't need an S8. He does need a device that gets security updates for more than a year after purchasing his phone. BAlGaInTl You are exactly correct, and I'm in the same situation with my OnePlus One. But in working to increase your security level, you leave holes behind. The key words that you used are "more secure." I agree. You are "more secure." But still (probably) less secure than a device that has been thoroughly tested, certified, and passes SafetyNet without hacks. Google has been open that they are working on security updates. They have improved significantly over the last couple years in getting those out. I feel that they are putting in place a real strategy to keep Android devices secure. This is part of that groundwork. I also feel that they are actively looking to replace Android in it's current state, and I can't say I blame them. The only real strategy may be to take lessons learned and start over. Lucky for them, they have the resources to do so. trparky > take lessons learned and start over Pretty much. The worst thing that they did from the very beginning was to allow for the OEMs to do what they wished. Google essentially made a deal with the devil when they released Android to the world. They wrote no requirements into the Android agreements that the OEMs agreed to to require updates to be a necessary thing. Big mistake Google. BAlGaInTl The really needed to in order to get their foot in the door of the market. If it would not have been open source from the beginning, none of the major manufactures would have bought off on it. The fact that they could use it for free (essentially) and still be able to customize on top of it is what sold it. trparky And now look at it, Android is a fucking mess of non-updated insecure devices that are ripe for anyone to be able to take over and turn into a botnet. trparky And you should be raising holy hell with the OEM that made that device! Just because your device is old doesn't mean that it shouldn't still be supported. Windows 7 is nearly eight years old and it still receives Windows Updates. Why can't your device? BAlGaInTl Normally, I would agree, but the OnePlus One is a special case. The OEM operating system is the now defunct Cyanogen OS. I had to balance having the original OS without updates, or running another with updates. The phone is now almost three years old. If I bought a PC with Windows on it three years ago, and Microsoft had since gone out of business, should the PC manufacturer be responsible for providing Windows 7 updates? Even though the PC is beyond it's support date? Sure, I can increase the security by switching to another OS that is updated. It may even be a Windows clone. But if a software developer decided to only support "original, unmodified" PC configurations, that would be within their right. trparky But it can be adapted to run LineageOS. Sudev There is bit difference in analogy here: OnePlus manufactured the phone and Cynogen Inc customized AOSP Android OS for it, they didn't developed it from ground up. I understand that Cynogen INC is out of business now too. However in PC world, it would be the case that you purchased a PC from Dell and get Microsoft Windows OS with some additional Dell software. If Dell or developer of that custom software goes out of business you still get OS update for your PC. Its not android OS itself out business here. Adrian and for the record, I absolutely agree that it was the content providers and not all on Netflix. trparky You should be demanding that OnePlus send an official update to your device. So what if your device is old? It should be still supported. Windows 7 is still supported nearly eight years later, why can't your device be supported for that long as well? Plumplam Who cares except for a bunch of XDA nerds? If it means better security then I'm all for it. Dmitri Smirnov Well, for starters, it doesn't mean better security, since it does nothing to address the problems with vulnerable outdated android versions that will be "certified", but will allow malicious apps to quietly escalate their privileges and do their dirty work, but will block "uncertified" custom roms that actually have all the recent secuirity patches and give user full control over who has root access and how. Also, "bunch of XDA nerds" are the source of a lot of features that had their trial run in custom ROMs and then were adopted to the AOSP. Should I remind you of "The Oak and the Pig" fable? Alienate the developers bringing new ideas to the ecosystem - lose the competetive edge you had over other OSes saf1927 Actually, custom ROMs never really have the latest security patches despite what they claim since kernels aren't maintained and no proprietary blobs is updated anymore. If ROM developers were OEMs, they'd be violating their agreements with Google by bumping the patch level without actually addressing all the vulnerabilities. Dmitri Smirnov Well they patch the AOSP to the same level as latest official one and kernel - if it's possible to do so without breaking the compatibility with compiled blobs or at least on the level of latest official firmware. So in the end run it's at least as secure as the official firmware, often - much more so. saf1927 If you look at the security bulletin, most vulnerabilities come from proprietary drivers and require these to be updated. On a supported device, these are provided by the chip manufacturers to the OEMs, on an unsupported device they aren't updated anymore. A custom ROM can only fix userspace security issues. In the end, bumping the patch level without addressing all vulnerabilities in that patch gives a false sense of security to users. Dmitri Smirnov If anything, this is an argument for forcing OEMs to opensource their blobs. For some reason community is much better at releasing the fixes for what they can change (userspace), while OEMs generally stop caring as soon as device is out the door. saf1927 The problem goes beyond OEMs unfortunately. All the phones you can buy are assembled with off-the-shelf components that they buy from other manufacturers and it is them that provide the binary blobs to the OEMs. If they stop supporting components, the OEMs can't do anything. For the chip, it's companies like Qualcomm, Samsung, Mediatek etc. that need to support it with up-to-date drivers. Once they stop, the life-cycle of a phone comes to an end. trparky And that is probably one of many reason why Qualcomm is facing a nice fat anti-trust lawsuit. Serves them right. trparky That ain't ever going to happen. There's no way they're going to allow for their intellectual property to be open for all the world to see and have it cracked open. It would be corporate suicide since their competitors would be able to reverse engineer their stuff. Suicide_Note Never heard of "The Oak and the Pig" before. Could you tell me more? Seriously. Dmitri Smirnov http://www.aliceswonderland.eu/Alice-ska350-en.html Maxr1998 Ah, Lessing. Going to read the original version in a minute :) username_not_valid Thats a very generous view of the custom ROM community. It might be true of a few, very few devs, but most ROMs are unsupported garbage with serious security issues. Dmitri Smirnov Maybe so, but out of this cesspool of garbage CyanogenMod was born, which became LineageOS. I'd say their quality standard appeals me more than a lot of OEMs. username_not_valid Cyanogen and Lineage was what i had in mind.. Each to his own i guess. BAlGaInTl Yes and no. I run Lineage on my OnePlus One because Cyanogen OS is no longer supported. I can say with certainty that Lineage introduces stability issues that I have to deal with to be up to date. Wilton Daniel Pinto Ninna pooty bewarci Qwip Consider the bigger picture. Right now, users are being shuffled into a situation where they must restrict the control they have over their device if they want to be able to use Netflix (and presumably banking apps will follow soon). That may seem fine, and from some security perspective it is probably a good thing. How much control do you have over your _laptop_? How much do you want? Right now, we're blissfully able to install unsigned software on our computers (although various OSs will complain about it), but will that last? How long will it be before we can only open our banking interface on our laptop using a trusted, digitally signed browser on a machine that is using secure boot and can only run signed binaries? I can understand the direction that Netflix (and others) are coming from, and to them it may even make sense. The question is: what is the cost of ceding control over our devices/machines in order to be able to watch netflix, etc. trparky Yeah and that's why Windows is the virus filled cesspool that it is today. Windows 10 is slowly changing Windows to be an app store based ecosystem in which all apps will be sandboxed. It's coming to the desktop near you. saf1927 I hope Magisk (or other similar mods in the future) keep working, so to prevent this. Not a problem on my Pixel XL since I haven't rooted it, but on my Nexus 5 Magisk allows it to pass Safety Net even though it's running a custom ROM (7.1.2) and it's rooted. Hendrik Leppkes SafetyNets primary purpose is to secure devices for Android Pay, and when you deal with actual money transactions on your device, you really don't want any hack interfering with it - so I'm quite certain they'll do whatever they can to break hacks like this and ensure the security and integrity of the device. h4rr4r No, its primary purpose is to make the device trustworthy for others not the person who paid for it. This is how it makes it "secure" for android pay. You are a possible threat and this closes that. Suicide_Note It would seem that Google is erecting a wall around their garden, too. EowynCarter While Apple opens iOS more and more. YouNex According to the support/help page, a device is not certified if it stops getting Android updates. How fuck up is that ? I don't get it. My Moto X has always been on stock ROM, yet it's showing up as non certified. Yes it's rooted + system modifications, but at no point is it stated that root prevents it from being certified. Suicide_Note Really? You can't understand why your rooted/system modified device is non-certified? YouNex I know how to read, but this is vague https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/b6f710b8628f0e09ab73ba144c133a2c9b1fe1325b353ae7dc1636f2776b2ac0.png "Not secure" jonzey231 Root and/or unlocked bootloader = Not certified. YouNex It says nothing about root or bootloader https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/b6f710b8628f0e09ab73ba144c133a2c9b1fe1325b353ae7dc1636f2776b2ac0.png ast00 Can't wait until LastPass excludes root users... Fuck them. Adonis K. If they do, I'm cancelling my subscription... Naxx ENVY Fuck them and yet they haven't done anything yet ... #internetlogic Also i know right , crazy for a company that stores your passwords to make themselves more secure . ABSOLUTE CRAZY , RAGE RAGE RAGE Jordan Palmer I don't understand your reasoning or rationale for these two statements. ast00 The second part is related to Google. Sorry about the confusion. Believe it or not, most of us root users keep SELinux in it's Enforcing state. This means we are safe. Nothing gets root rights without us knowing. Our phones are just as safe if not safer than most stock phones. JATIN BANSAL SafetyNet test can be passed using Magisk Manager. I am using it and it works fine for me. Even in play store, my device is certified. May be this helps someone. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/3756499ff5876545740cd0e88e38961bb2c327d90fc43f5801f4bce5d802c990.png https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/44185f640490cb506a68a3414579bd345123f7d52ee2e11802d31d5141db11ae.png Nick Most people are worried about the future when the exploits that Magisk uses are patched and it continues to make it harder for people to get around this. JATIN BANSAL That's what I am also worried about. I just posted this for those who are already rooted and for now want to keep the root. My main purpose of rooting was to flash lineage OS. I think custom rom is the only way of staying updated to latest version of Android as google itself doesn't update their phones after 2 years (18 months I think) for reasons they have. I think if someone buys a flagship device which costs 700$+, it should have 3-4 years of full software update support. 😆😄 2 years of major OS version updates and 3 years of security patches. After 3 years, its time to buy a new phone cuz its so old anyway. trparky Says you! Windows 7 was released on July 22, 2009 and they still support it EIGHT YEARS LATER! And they plan on supporting it until the year 2020 which means it will be supported for a total of ELEVEN YEARS! If Microsoft can do it, Google can too!!! Does Microsoft suddenly say "Your machine is too old, go buy a new one"? No, they continue to give you Windows Updates for years later. We should also be demanding that the Android OEMs do so as well. A Samsung Note 5 has more than enough hardware in it to run Android 7 but no... we can't do that, we need to make money so we don't update them to force you to buy a new device. Lambdadelta Magisk...alright, thanks for the tip-off. I really must get it. TadMSTR Magisk doesn't always pass SafetyNet. I have some devices it fails on. However, several other devices it works just fine. Make sure you turn on the hide root option, it's off by default. Lambdadelta Well, I do have a problem, and that is my device is not able to download it directly from Google Play, so I have to get the APK from XDA. I dunno why this is the case for my phone though. Is it because it's a 4.4.4? Either way, I'll get the APK moved to my phone later tonight. Teodor Axel Johan Jönsson I have activated hide root option, and it passes SafetyNet, but in Google Play Store, it still shows uncertified. What app should I hide root from to get Play Store to show Certified? JATIN BANSAL As per XDA: Q: Safety Net fails after enabling MagiskHide A: Magisk can only hide Magisk core features, for Magisk modules it depends on what the module does. If your ROM itself is not able to pass SafetyNet, then there is nothing Magisk can help. Your best bet is 100% stock ROMs, because your phone manufacturer is forced to release a device passing CTS. Teodor Axel Johan Jönsson What in Magisk Hide did you check/how did you do it? Google Play Store? Or Play services? Because here it says uncertified :( JATIN BANSAL Just clear app data of play store. Now it will show your device certified Teodor Axel Johan Jönsson Thanks! Muzaffar I believe that root and custom rom makes android what it is now. This feels like betrayal for Android enthusiast. username_not_valid Well maybe in the very early days (maybe), but not any more. Rooted phones make up a tiny fraction of active devices. Muzaffar It's not about active devices. It's about how android develop together with community (well as i remember) I believe that those "rooted user" contribute many things that make android right now. I still remember status bar (and nav bar) color change was implemented on Kitkat before it becomes official on lollipop. Also, we can't forget how badly mobile active network bug happens in lollipop if it's not those "rooted user" who found out the fix via xposed. and i believe there are still more. trparky We can blame the OEMs for that kind of stuff because of things like locked bootloaders, eFuses, etc. username_not_valid Or we can blame ROM makers for it because they kept breaking the devices causing warranty claims. Naxx ENVY no offence but that's small thinking ... i'd say 90% of people on Android devices don't want or even know about root, heck it may even be 95% ... security is more of a concern, sure it annoys us geeks, but that's the 5% at most. Muzaffar And about half of android devices is left outdated. Not to mention bugs that unsolved on previous android. I'll pick a dumb phone instead, if android becomes a closed platform. trparky And truth be told that's why I have an iPhone. I simply got sick and tired of the lack of updates so I told myself I'm going to the iPhone and have been happy ever since. OK sure, it may not have all of the customization features that Android has but I can be guaranteed that I will get software and security updates on time, every time, regardless of my carrier of choice. refthemc I think you misread his comment, he's saying that root and custom roms got Android to where it is TODAY not saying that it is necessary TODAY. And I agree. trparky It pretty much comes down to this. Google is simply targeting a much larger piece of the pie. You can't blame them for trying to do what is necessary to protect not only the platform but the Android brand itself. Qwip Well, it isn't like there is anywhere else to go though, is it? Google can basically throw enthusiasts who have promoted and fostered android development under the bus - they don't need them any more. trparky Money trumps community. Always has, always will. username_not_valid Ad blocking was the last holdout reason to root for me, but even thats no longer a good reason with things like Adhell, Adguard etc I have no other reason to root now, custom ROMs are generally garbage, and bloat can usually be uninstalled or disabled, so its just not needed. Adonis K. custom ROMs have nothing to do with root... thevigilante Custom ROMs have uncertified flag in Play Store Mike Avellanosa Not all, though George Byers My Nexus 7 2013 is passing safteynet running Lineage unrooted. Wilton Daniel Pinto Let me guess, you have a Pixel. Or you wouldn't call custom ROMs bloated while the reality is other way round username_not_valid Wouldn't touch a Pixel actually. username_not_valid Should be noted that I didn't call custom ROMs bloated, I guess you misread it. Wilton Daniel Pinto Oh yeah, I misread it . My bad Zach Mauch This is going to cause the same problem I see in governments work with security. They will blindly block things like root and bootloader unlock regardless of if it poses any credible threat because it FEELS more secure. Blah!!!!!! Naxx ENVY it IS more secure, not just " feels" h4rr4r More secure for them, not for me the owner of the device. Besides, not even for them in the long term. An up to date ROM has many exploits patched that a two versions out of date and 12 months behind on security patches OTA has. Zach Mauch What I mean is they will apply restrictions because they easily can and it gives a warm fuzzy for them. They will do this regardless of the impact to the user. The analogy here is that in my job I am constantly unnecessary restrictions and bureaucracy that make doing my job much more difficult. For instance, we are disallowed from using remote desktop on standalone computer networks. It would make our job MUCH MUCH easier in many circumstances and save money on software as I could remote into my PC from anywhere in the building. Yet they deny us that and claim security. jonzey231 So this will force people to install apps from unauthorized sources, thus making the whole Android malware issue that much more prevalent. Great.. Suicide_Note Unless being held at gunpoint, no one is forced to install apps from unauthorized sources. That's a user's CHOICE. jonzey231 You know what I mean. Stop playing devil's advocate on everyone's posts. Eric Braun He's not incorrect. Kyle R Krcmaric "Stop providing an alternate viewpoint to my own." It's just comments. Anyway, I think Google also announced that even sideloaded apps will get scanned by their new Google Play Protect service, which may help nullify the risk of sideloading in the first place. d0x360 That's not an alternate viewpoint unless your view is "don't install any apps ever" There is no logical argument to defend this move by Google. None. username_not_valid Yes there is. Come content creators will not allow a provider to support a rooted or otherwise compromised device. Right or wrong in your eyes thats the reality, and in order for Android to be able to have such services Google have to do this. d0x360 What you said isn't an alternate viewpoint lol you are just repeating the reason Google is doing this which everyone agrees is a fact. As for this new comment...a rooted phone isn't compromised. Tell me...what would a rooted user do with Netflix that would make Netflix want to block them? Are they worried about people copying movies because if they think Android is the vector for that action they are idiots. All they are doing is making a problem by allowing bad actors to inject malware into a Netflix apk that could be installed by both root and unrooted users. Genius! Give me 1 good reason to block rooted phones from an app like oh I dunno, Mario run or whatever it's called. Any answers you give are false. Wanna know why? Hacked apks exist to allow cheating and they can be installed by anyone rooted or not. In fact I'd stake my life that your average unrooted user is installing more modified apk files to cheat in games or whatever than any rooted user. People who root are generally better educated about the Android eco system and do less dumb stuff. As for Netflix I cancelled my account on the day they did this and now I just use a friends account so they lost a subscriber due to this move and I rarely ever used the app. Sure 1 person closing an account that's existed since the day they opened isn't going to do much but I vote with my wallet and if a company does something I dislike then they simply don't get my money. The first person I asked gave me their login info and I made a profile. It's just like how I share my HBO subscription with someone else. Easy easy. username_not_valid See my previous comment. Its not for me to argue, the fact is content providers want it, fair or not, end of story, therefore its going to happen. The tiny number of rooters out there are meaningless to them, and Google. Netflix has to do this because the providers of its non-original content demand it. Its not Netflix fault, they either do it or lose shows. Losing large amounts of their content would affect their subscription base several orders of magnitude more than losing rooted users, who chances are, use the service on more than their phone or tablet anyway. d0x360 Once again I ask... what about a rooted device is dangerous to an app and also this is now a second question, what makes it compromised? BAlGaInTl Clearly you've made up your mind on the issue, but I'll give it a go. It isn't necessarily the root that is dangerous to an app or vice versa. The compromise comes from other apps/processes that can take advantage of root. If you don't understand that, then you don't understand what root really is. It has a lot of valuable uses, but it can also be dangerous. To address your previous statement, just because it rubs me the wrong way. So your "solution" was to cancel your Netflix account and then steal the content? So clearly, you aren't "actually" affected by the change, because you can still watch Netflix. You do realize that watching their content is also valuable to them and makes them money? If you want to boycott Netflix for their practices, then by all means do. Otherwise, it just comes across as hypocritical IMHO. d0x360 I don't believe I asked you. No I'm not stealing Netflix content, it's being paid for and Netflix has many times in the past encouraged account sharing. Of course they did so in the hopes you would join but they still allow it. I paid my Netflix dues. Day 1 4 disc member, then as soon as it was available I upgraded to the 4k 4 user package. It's not piracy either, I'm not recording or distributing the content. If Netflix wants to dick with me I'll dick with them. I never said this was permanent but I vote with my wallet. Vote cast. I also haven't used Netflix once since that day despite being able to. I've been using Amazon and Microsoft video where I own over 500 movies so you can stuff the whole theft argument. I've bought more content than most and that doesn't include my DVD, Blu-ray, and uhd Blu-ray collection which is well over 1400 movies and TV shows at this point. Your right...I've been rooting since the first Android phone but I totally don't understand the possibilities. My argument is simple. The overwhelming majority of root users don't mess with apps. To hell with that nonsense argument anyways. What is the danger to Netflix? Copying movies? Please...it's a million times easier to do it on a PC. Even windows xp can handle it without issue. Does Netflix and you I suppose really think root users are using the app to steal content? If so how? Show me one forum topic, one article, one modified Netflix apk that allows downloading and bypassing their drm. I'm begging you. Just 1. BAlGaInTl I reviewed the Netflix TOS, and I will agree that you are not stealing. I'll even remove the verbiage from my post. Netflix does not make any such stipulation. They speak only of the "Account Owner" and "Devices." I guess I just assumed that, and that's my bad. As I've said in other posts... It isn't all about Netflix. A large part of it is about their content. They really can't argue that point with providers. You either play by their rules, work to establish new rules, or choose not to carry them. Netflix wants to stay relevant on all platforms. That's the main danger to Netflix. In addition, I shouldn't have to give an example in the wild of an exploit. Just because it is difficult to find doesn't mean it doesn't exist. What if someone else writes an app that uses root to mine user account data from Netflix? Should Netflix not be worried about protecting user data? If that happens, who is responsible for the security and the bad press? Probably not Netflix, but they would certainly be impacted. I checked my app really quick (which is stuck on version 4 because I'm affected). Since Netflix keeps you logged in for convenience (that's spelled out in their terms), a quick look gives my full name, username, phone number, zip code, the brand of payment card, and the last 4 digits of that card. That's quite a bit of information that can easily be gathered by a piece of Malware. Now as I said... Netflix probably wouldn't be liable if a user was compromised because of root. It would certainly be a danger to their business however. Why should the be asked to take that risk? It seems to me that they are approaching this in a realistic manner, and rolling it out in a reasonable way. Would this affect the majority of root users? Probably not. By their nature, root users will find ways around it anyway. The problem is that the impact to Netflix from losing content and/or a compromised app is disproportionate the loss of blocking root users. It's simply a numbers game, and you can't blame Netflix for that. And you certainly can't blame Google who is trying to improve security. username_not_valid Thats not for me to decide, or argue, the fact is the content providers have decided that rooting is a risk to their copyrighted content, and as such services like Netflix, Amazon, and other streaming services must comply and lock out rooted devices. Passing safetynet and using Googles DRM framework is the easiest way to claim due diligence, so thats what they will do, and in order to keep Android competitive Google is providing the tools needed to make it possible. What I will argue though is that your notion that custom ROMs etc are more secure is unfounded. The best might well be, but there are hundreds of completely random and unchecked ROMs out there that could contain absolutely anything, you cant possibly claim that custom ROMs are inherently safer or more secure than OEM ROMs, outdated or not. jonzey231 So let's play this out: If someone takes the Netflix .apk and mods it with malware and then signs it, it will pass installation on the device. 1. User opens app. 2. App does whatever shitty thing it's designed to do while the user thinks they just got around the block. 3. The OS scans the app and warns the user it's been modified and they should uninstall it. 4. User thinks "Ha! I know and that's why it works!" 5. User keeps app until they get a call from Credit Karma that their identity was probably stolen but they don't know how. 6. Person spends 6 months fixing stolen identity. But still uses that app the whole time. Ultimately, that user is still going to be screwed. Would you or I make this mistake? No. Would your cousin's friend's dad because he had his son root so he could tether for free and overheard you guys talking about sideloading apps and googled how to do it? Yes. Randroid Problem is, even in your scenario, root has nothing to do with it. Someone who is not rooted could do the same thing. The only problem is, now MORE people who root are going to be *forced* to look for a modified apk because the official apk is not available from the Play Store. So in the end, it's causing more problems than it's fixing. Corbin Baxter Here's the thing about rooting: when you alter your devices software like that, then Google shouldn't be responsible for anything that comes afterwards for the user. This just helps discourage rooting, which can alter a new users perspective on Android, or make someone reconsider getting an Android device. someone755 For what it's worth, back in 2011/2010, many of us bought into Android *because* we could root. Imagine the possibilities of being in control of so much more of your system than with any mobile OS prior; We've spent hundreds (some, thousands) of dollars in this environment, on devices, apps, books etc. I understand this isn't how things stand nowadays, but root is still prevalent because of one issue that Google will not fix (or at least, won't until O+ is running on the majority of devices, but that'll take two years at the minimum), and those are updates and vendor apps (i.e. bloatware). If my phone is stuck on Lollipop I'm going to root it; I'll be able to mitigate the memory leak performance drops, and overall customize the device to fit my specific needs -- I've made quite a few friends (think ROM and kernel devs) because I just wanted to put a thermal engine better than Qualcomm's horrendous MPDecision into the kernel directly (i.e. I took the kernel source and modified it to fit my needs). What Google is trying to do here is, yes, discourage rooting, but instead of fixing the root cause (heh) behind why people root in the first place (that is, again, customizability and personal(ized) performance tuning, in large part to keep devices on older Android versions alive), root wouldn't be necessary. In the long run this *might* fix the symptom, but it most definitely will not help in fixing the cause. And that's because the cause is Google itself. As if apps like Snapchat blocking power users from their apps wasn't enough, now there's this -- If it becomes so common that even Google's own apps start to utilize the feature, I'll be gone to another mobile platform within a month. That might mean iOS, it might mean S60v3, I'll know that if (or rather, when) it happens. tl;dr: Google is putting a band-aid on a shotgun wound. Corbin Baxter I'm speaking mainly for new Android users. They don't feel as comfortable rooting. Doing this makes Android SEEM more like iOS. This doesn't MAKE Android like iOS. New users are comfortable with that. This is the same issue Microsoft had with Windows 8/8.1. Classic users, and Windows enthusiasts, hated someone changing the way they would use their computers. Microsoft introduced a different way of doing things, and to enthusiasts, it was bad, no matter how good it might be. Google's Project Treble should mostly fix the fragmentation problem, therefore giving Android users one less reason to root. To us enthusiasts, nothing can beat rooting, but it might not be the best solution to the problems Android has. Google seems intent on fixing the problems rooting tries to solve, but in a higher-quality and reliable way. No hard feelings😉 trparky They won't understand that, they're too blinded by their geek rose colored glasses. Corbin Baxter I don't expect everyone to understand, but I'll be happy if even a small handful understand what Google is doing here. Dmitri Smirnov > when you alter your devices software like that, then Google shouldn't be responsible for anything that comes afterwards for the user. As if right now Google or the OEMs are in any ways responsible for the malware or unpatched firmware vulnerabilities that stay this way for year. But yes, the users that root are the problem. Corbin Baxter For unrooted phones, yes Google and OEMs are very responsible. But after you root, Android loses most of its security and stability, and rooting is basically tinkering with core system files. Google doesn't have any control over what the user can or can't do after that. bekifft That wasn't even a devil's advocate, that was a straight up strawman. Frosted Butts Yes.. please tell me about all the Netflix alternatives i can install, that can legally stream from Netflix...... Right now, if i am rooted and want Netflix (a service i am paying for), i must go through 3rd party app stores to install the APK. There is no choice at all... R Firestone ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ Umm you have the choice to unroot your device. Maxr1998 ..which is a bad choice for many. d0x360 Yes you do except I rooted my device to make it MORE secure. Unrooting would make my device less secure than sideloading apps would. username_not_valid People can keep saying that, but the content providers have no way to know whether or not you have taken measures to secure your custom device, whereas if they go down this root they know its handled. BAlGaInTl "whereas if they go down this root they know its handled" I see what you did there. 😆😄 ...or just watch Netflix from Chrome! You could even do this from a Linux box with root! 😃 Suicide_Note Sure there is: unroot. Problem solved. neoKushan "I've solved this problem by creating 3 more problems - but it IS solved!" Eric Braun https://www.amazon.com/Netflix-Inc/dp/B005ZXWMUS Option C .. ?? h4rr4r A choice that is now more popular. dcdttu It's not so much about what a user chooses to do. It's about probability. The probability that sites are going to try to lure users into downloading malware-infected Netflix APKs from 3rd party sites is going to go up if you can't download it from a safe source in the first place. This is just like the fact that, if you don't give drug users a safe and clean place to shoot up, they're going to go do it somewhere else that's much more dangerous. Both of these scenarios are bad for society in general, no matter what the original intention was. kgptzac 1/10. Gotta try harder. Premsuraj How? Google Play Protect will still catch malicious apps makapav Yes but you're potentially making people venture through shady sites to get the APKs. Eric Braun Or to Amazons App store or Fdroid. The people going to shady sites are already going there, this isn't going to increase the traffic by any real amount. tehboogieman Are you sure that Google will continue allowing GPP for unlocked or rooted users going forward? Not to mention that it's not a silver bullet for 0days d0x360 It barely works as is. There are tons of apps that slip through every day. Krebs on security reports on them quite frequently. I don't trust Google's scanning of apps at all which is why I root. I can make my phone more secure and I can also image the device as often as I want so if something does happen it's fixed within 5 min. If I unroot then I lose the protection along with the backups. Premsuraj Custom ROMs and root can't protect from 0days either. And just out of curiosity how is root going to provide more security? If anything it makes the device less secure tehboogieman Nobody said root makes a device more secure. Blocking root users from downloading apps from the Play Store puts users at more risk since those users will be more inclined to sideload apps from sources that might not be as reliable as the Play Store. Premsuraj The only people who cares about this are the people who root. And those user's generally tend to be more knowledgeable about what kind of apps and app stores they can trust. ASYOUTHIA✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ And only <2% of users will do this to keep rooted. xxTheGoDxx Only the plus 50 - 100 Million users that have root: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=eu.chainfire.supersu ASYOUTHIA✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ You do realize that that's just downloads right? ...not active users. blindexecutioner I'm not mad. I continue to use things like magisk to help get around stuff like this. All this will do is encourage me to use unauthorized sources for offending apps if magisk ever stops working. There is a reason I use Android over iOS and it certainly isn't because the apps are better designed or whatever. brian. Magisk is a good way around this. However, I don't know how long this will last. I would think with security in mind and developers trying to monetize more, it will put pressure on Google to make SafetyNet get triggered much easier. Obviously, I don't have any way of knowing, but this could easily turn into a cat and mouse game more than it already is. Android Pay was first, other apps did it like Super Mario Run, which who cares, but now Netflix? Changes are coming, and it doesn't look good for the rooting community. D13H4RD2L1V3 I'm not sure if everyone gets why some of us went through the trouble of gaining SU access. Sure, maybe there's a few who went through all that trouble for nefarious purposes (and maybe that got regulatory bodies concerned to the point where Google even needed to consider this) but from my perspective at least, a lot of us gain Superuser access mainly to get features that we liked on other Android flavors, especially in the case of a build of Android that's very close to Google's vision. Such as the ability to hide the navbar at any time we wanted and also to gain theming support (which I feel should be added officially sooner rather than later because I absolutely hate how Google is making their already-bright UI even more eye-searing with even more white-colored elements, which also makes the benefits of OLED much less obvious). I wouldn't be as concerned if these features were pushed to AOSP soon, but as it stands, I feel that Google should probably think about making these features available soon. Marty Thank the bad apples for why you no longer have freedom. Jeremy ディリマ Would changing region firmware with Odin flag the SafetyNet check on Samsung mobiles? Soz if it's a stupid question a lot has changed since I last fiddled with Android Christopher Robert This was a long time coming. Once root user started using root to pirate software, and/or get around geo locks, instead of using it to add feature to their firmware or improve their devices performance, it was only a matter of time before it all got torn down. h4rr4r Get around geo locks? You mean have my device report the location I want it to report? Yeah, how terrible that I control what my computer does. dizel123 You still do. This doesn't affect that at all h4rr4r You said the justification for that was people using their devices for their own reasons in the way they liked. I was pointing out that this is a normal thing and not something that should be punished. Cuvis You don't need root to pirate. You never did. Marty Apple says, Thank you. h4rr4r Sounds like we need a new FREE platform. Maybe Amazon can use this to push their store. mxwp but will the Netflix from the Amazon App Store work on rooted phones? Curt RIP Root. I'm not moving from stock anymore, just cab with the hassle. Until there's a 'reliable' way to hide from Safety Net, I'll enjoy my Android Pay, banking apps and overall smoothness. (If it was up to me, I'd be rooted with Linage) h4rr4r IOS is the platform for you. That was the deal from the beginning. hp-fourtwenty magisk....giyf .y phone is rooted with lineage 14.1, and passes safetynet. problem solved! jcopernicus Fantastic news. Lawstorant All this butthurt for what? You all sound like Magisk doesn't exist. Dave Hamilton Lets take Apple and there closed source. Lets take Google and there open source, the freedom to do and change as you please to make the device yours. No two devices have to be the same. Lets get 115 million android users, and then start deciding you no longer have this choice and freedom to do what you want! When something gets better and better, its only a matter of time before all the things you love are removed and comersilised Eric Braun You still have the option to do what you want. However like everything there are reactions for every action. Want to root or unlock your device? Sure, however there may be a few apps that no longer appear in the playstore. May want to have a backup like Amazon App Store or something similar ready. No one is stopping you, feel free to do as you please. tehboogieman Man, if I have to choose between having a device with root or a device with apps that use day to day, the iPhone goes from a 1% chance of being my daily driver to about 50% There are still a lot that can Android can do that iOS can't, but if I'm living in a walled garden the iPhone is looking pretty attractive. 5+ years of official OS support, solid retail network for quick service or hardware exchanges. The Play Store is my main source of apps that I know are vetted and generally safe. I have no desire to manage app updates manually. There is always a chance that someone will build and maintain an appstore that will have all root blocked apps (maybe the future of APKMirror?). If not it might be the death of Android for users like me Eric Braun Even without all of this I would use an APKMirror App that allowed for updating of apps automatically. dizel123 Google gives app developers more control over their apps. Whiny entitled internet crybabies go on the internet and whine and cry. Aka...Thursday neoKushan Alternatively: Google restricts users from using their device, which they own, how they see fit. dizel123 Except Google isn't restricting anyone from doing anything. But being 100% wrong has never stopped anyone in the internet NubCake being an asshole (in your case) hasn't stopped anyone from commenting eather it seems. dizel123 I can admit to being an asshole. But I'm also right so it's all good. neoKushan It's certainly not stopping you. dizel123 I haven't experienced it so of course it's not stopping me trparky You may own the hardware but you don't own the software, you only have a license to use it. Csöpi Thats so greate. I have a stock oneplus one and for some strange reasons i was failing the test beforhand, but now its all green. Still cant update the netflix app hence chromecast isnt working either anymore. Not really happy. JC If there's a will there's a way. brian. If more developers get on board with this, I can't see why I would switch to Android. I've always been curious about new Android phones, bought a bunch and rooted them all if I could. This is not good for a person like me. d0x360 If Google keeps this up and app devs include the api to block rooted phones then my days using Android will be over and Google will have lost a user who's been there since the g1. I don't know what I'd switch to... probably windows mobile because I'm not a fan of apple whatsoever. It's really a shame because if I had to guess I'd say 99.99% of people who root do so for either the added security and or customized experiences. For example I use root to modify my status bar and quick panel as well as firewall my apps and use adaway and yes Google I do whitelist sites that aren't obnoxious with their ads. John Doe All the more reason for the APK mirror appstore LoL Jan-Lk Else Yeah Google want's us to buy tooooo expensive phones to just get the latest Android, because cheap phones suck at updates and so they need to be flashed and rooted... trparky But if the community raises holy hell with the OEMs then maybe it will be corrected. There's no damn reason why a three year old device can't be updated when an eight year old Windows 7 machine is still receiving Windows Updates. McStagger WHY DOES NETFLIX CARE IF THE PHONE IS ROOTED?!?!?!?! mxwp Netflix does not care, but the content creators that make the stuff you see on Netflix do care. They care because they are idiots who think it is easier to pirate from rooted phones. bekifft Again, Google becomes more and more restrictive. I switched from iPhone because the screens were too small, and Google was far less restrictive. Both of those issues are now resolved, and Google's upped the price of their device to match Apple. May as well switch back to iPhone, Google seems to support it just as much as Android anyway. Luxferro Except it's not just rooted users! Any device with an unlocked bootloader. hp-fourtwenty Your comment sucks for misinforming users about what safetynet is....has NOTHING to do with unlocked bootloaders. Luxferro Sure it does. My Nexus 6P only has an unlocked bootloader, and Netflix disappeared from the play store after the last update. And I'm not the only one, so I suggest you do some reading. TechGuy22 more reason for me to pirate hey, have at it Matías Duarte I hope Netflix does the same with Jailbroken iOS devices. Why they do this btw? To prevent people recording their movies? You can do that with Windows.. Knowledgeborn Allah In all honesty, that'll probably never happen. Jailbreaking iOS opens the doors to a lot of customization on an iPhone, but the security issues are often minimal (with the exception being not having the latest software version). Jailbreaking is pretty much filtered through the Cydia platform. You don't have access to the entire system with a jailbreak. Rooting is completely different, because you can completely reshape the core OS. fbl Note : I don't work for Netflix so I can't comment for them. Possible causes : - the right holders might be pushing for this. I work on roughly the same product area and we don't implement DRM because we like them, we implement them because we contractually have to. -Netflix is tired of getting low notes because of crashes coming by shitty hacks in custom roms. Zach Mauch Anyone know how chromebooks will be affected by this? Will dev mode being enabled cause you to fail SafetyNet Checks? That is currently the only way to install apks on Chromebooks. Branko But Android AOSP!11 -Google 2011 How the times how changed. Wayne Randall ALT arguement, because I don't have time to read every comment... This doesn't limit me and my rooted N6P at all, this move limits how much money they (the devs and Google) are going to make. I can't buy it (the app or coins, or special characters, or bonus content, w/e) if I can't see it. Plain and simple. The important apps will still be there. No app is worth unroot. Block Project Fi from root though... weeeellll. I guess I'd unroot for that. mxwp yeah, only Netflix, banks, and big names will use these blocks. i am guessing most devs want as much exposure as possible. PVL_93_RU Google is actively trying to kill the modding community. Not the Custom ROM makers, but people who root and install Xposed. All because they compromise the security for Android Pay I fear the day root and Xposed apps start disappearing from the Play Store trparky If it comes to security vs being open, security will always win (or at least should always win). Eric Koop I had my Shaw Gateway app update yesterday and they changed it so it doesn't work if rooted. So I had to uninstall and find an APK online of an older version. Now it's just a matter of time before I forget and re-install the update. What a pain... disqus_em5YfkbWdk Well this would certainly get me to cancel Netflix. My personal Plex server is far better than Netflix could ever be anyway. Vivek Rameses Becoming apple more and more every day. Disgusting. Knowledgeborn Allah Android is starting to look more and more like iOS with each update... ¯_(ツ)_/¯ trparky Open platforms rarely stay open once the Benjamins start rolling in. hp-fourtwenty Go ahead and block me...I'll just pirate your app. Play nice and so will I. Start poking me and I'll poke back by never giving you another penny. App devs can't beat XDA devs. It's not going to happen. My unlocked, rooted, rommed and modded device still passes safety net. The day that stops, so does the flow of money leaving my hands on the play store. Luxferro Lay off the sodas.... UniBroW Question, can those of you without access to Netflix on Google play, can it be installed from the Amazon App Store? Stanley C. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/dd381b7e8a39df74c4725712a0db906098c965e9ee4194b6e01e020fd69ee566.png Thats how magisk is made... Magic! Marti Abernathey Yawn. I've got a rooted device and just installed Netflix... because? Magisk. As soon as they made this choice I cancelled. Not because I can't get around it, but because they make me do that. mrjayviper even on a non-rooted LOS mis 5s+, I cannot install Netflix. unlocking the bootloader already tripped safety. And I don't want to root. The features available in non-rooted LOS is enough for me. Teh BuG No. Bueno. TedPhillips Sigh. What's the over-under on this becoming pervasive in the play store... MicroG / Fdroid I'm coming soon. World needs a solid single alternative gcm replacement to catch on. TedPhillips As far as the potential for support overhead, being rooted is generally less than the pain coming from the Xposed/magisk crowd. You need to be actively interfering with an app via root vs code being injected into low levels of the framework that everything uses. TedPhillips I think the best outcome could be that Google opens up their process for little guys to certify there own rom builds, ala let's encrypt lowering friction on getting ssl setup. AOSP should not be a functionally useless base implementation for I'm roms, but something you can use in​ practice. TedPhillips Hey guys, don't worry. Google says Android is for everyone. https://www.android.com/everyone/ That includes AOSP developers too, right? That website seems to tread the line pretty carefully, ala 'no one is forcing you use Google play' but Hiroshi's quote seems like it comes with a grain of salt since he owns Play. I'd love to see AP interview him about this. qkjDlav As an app developer for a large app used globally, the two biggest time wasters in a developer's life are a) debugging device specific issues (HTC, Samsung, etc) and b) crash logs with Xposed in the stack trace. Developers are tired of having to sit around with device farms at their desks just to make sure new features and changes work with each quirky variant of Android that manufacturers want to deploy, and custom roms do make it worse. Enthusiasts are welcome to customize their own versions of Android and sideload apps, but we don't want to see crashlogs in the Developer Console from rooted/custom ROM users. And companies probably don't want to keep paying us to debug issues that only a small minority of users will see. Lê Nguyên Chương Most stupid thing I've ever heard in my life.

High-Def Digest Blu-ray Ultra HD Gaming Blu-ray Gaming HD Gear Blu-ray Ultra HD Gaming HD Gear Blu-ray Ultra HD Games Blu-ray Ultra HD Games Home News HD Gear News Roundup: LG Tests 4K HFR OLED Broadcast, Google Reveals Daydream VR Updates, and More HD Gear News Roundup: LG Tests 4K HFR OLED Broadcast, Google Reveals Daydream VR Updates, and More Posted Thu May 18, 2017 at 09:20 PM PDT by Steven Cohen We've compiled the latest gear news, including a 4K HFR test transmission, Daydream updates, and new digital audio players.  From product announcements and streaming app updates to general industry news and recent gear trends, keeping up with the latest tech news can be a daunting task. With that in mind, we're here to offer you a roundup of some of the latest gear and consumer electronics news that you may have missed. For this edition, we're covering LG's recent 4K high frame rate broadcast test, new Google Daydream VR developments, two new digital audio players from Onkyo, and a new Polk Audio 5.1 sound bar. So, without further ado, here's a rundown of some of the latest gear and tech news: LG & SES Demo 4K HFR Broadcast LG and SES demonstrated a 4K High Frame Rate (HFR) test transmission at the SES Industry Days conference in Luxembourg on May 16 and 17. The broadcast was conducted live via an ASTRA satellite and was displayed on an LG OLED TV using prototype HFR software. "We are very excited to demonstrate just how effective LG's OLED TV is as a platform for 4K HFR and other high grade content," said Sam Kim, senior vice president and head of TV product planning at the LG Home Entertainment Company. "LG is committed to offering consumers around the world the latest in TV technologies and High Frame Rate on OLED TVs must be seen to be believed. Watching 4K HFR content on an OLED TV as it’s being transmitted in real time by ASTRA’s satellite is a great example of pushing the limits of current TV technologies." HFR next-gen broadcast tech allows for playback of 4K content at up to 120 frames per second. Most current technology typically supports the playback of 60 FPS content or less, and conventional films are usually shot at 24 FPS. An increase in frames per second can create more fluid images, making the format ideal for fast action material like sports while also helping to eliminate artifacts like motion blur and judder. In order to support the tech, global broadcasters and content providers will be using the DVB UHD-1 Phase 2 specification, which features 4K HFR playback along with High Dynamic Range (HDR) and Next-generation Audio (NGA). "SES has been steadily pushing forward the development of Ultra HD, and the Industry Days event has always been an excellent platform to showcase new TV technology," said Thomas Wrede, Vice President New Technology & Standards at SES. "High Frame Rate will be an important step towards further enhancing the quality of Ultra HD satellite transmissions, in particular for sports and reality TV events. Our continued partnership with LG Electronics is important in setting the broadcast standards of tomorrow and pioneering future TV technologies, and we are very pleased to work with LG Electronics on such an important milestone."

Highlights include updated Daydream software and the reveal of the first standalone Daydream headsets. The Daydream VR platform offers a growing collection of more than 150 VR apps across all Daydream-ready mobile devices and headsets -- like Google's own Pixel smartphone and Daydream View. Dubbed Daydream Euphrates, the upcoming Daydream 2.0 software will offer several new features, including the ability to capture what a user sees, casting support for putting a user's virtual view on the big screen, and the option to watch YouTube videos in VR with other people in a shared virtual space. Likewise, support for Daydream is coming to even more smartphones, including the Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8+ which will become Daydream ready this summer. In addition, the first standalone Daydream headsets will be released later this year. Standalone headset models will not require a smartphone or PC, and will instead use their own integrated displays and hardware optimized for VR. Daydream standalone headsets will also use new headset tracking technology called WorldSense, which can enable positional tracking to determine a user's precise movements in space without any external sensors. Google has partnered with Qualcomm to create the standalone headset reference design, and upcoming standalone Daydream headsets are in development from HTC VIVE and Lenovo. Meanwhile, the Daydream View headset is currently on sale for a suggested retail price of $79.The headset is available in Slate, Crimson, or Snow colors and is made with flexible and soft breathable fabrics, allowing the device to be 30% lighter than similar products while providing added comfort.  Sources: Google 1, Google 2 Onkyo Details New Digital Audio Players Onkyo has announced two additions to the company's digital audio player lineup.

The upcoming MagniFi MAX SR offers a 5.1 surround sound experience with wireless surround speakers and a subwoofer. "As sound bars continue to flood the market, consumers with an ear toward traditional surround sound are met with a huge array of products and technologies that supposedly bring 5.1 audio to the forefront," said Michael Greco, global brand director, Polk Audio. "While many sound bars certainly improve upon what TVs can offer, the majority lack the sound stage, imaging, and discrete immersive surround sound experience of the MagniFi MAX SR. With the MagniFi MAX SR, we're aiming to change that by providing proven technological tools like Polk's patented SDA and Voice Adjust technology, Dolby Digital and DTS decoding, HDMI connectivity and wireless surrounds so consumers have the option to create a true 5.1 system that mimics what component audio can deliver with the ease of setting up a sound bar." The sound bar uses Polk Audio's patented Stereo Dimensional Array (SDA®) digital surround technology and includes support for DTS and Dolby Digital decoding, Bluetooth connectivity, and Google Home featuring Chromecast for audio. The system features four 1-inch by 3-inch full-range drivers, two 0.75-inch tweeters, one 1-inch center channel driver, and an included 8-inch ported woofer.

Netflix was just the start: Google Play Console lets developers exclude app availability for devices that don't pass SafetyNet Rita El Khoury Follow View All Posts 2017/05/18 3:57am PDTMay 18, 2017 93 Plus 1 on G+ 108 Share on Facebook 82 Share on Twitter Total Shares283 Google News Last weekend, a huge turmoil swept the root-enthusiast Android community as it was discovered then confirmed that the Netflix app was being blocked from showing up in search results on the Play Store for rooted devices. At the time, Netflix said it was using Widevine to block unsupported devices, but that made no sense to us: the app was still functional if it was sideloaded, it was only not showing up as compatible in the Play Store. So what sorcery was Netflix really using?! Turns out it's a new function of the Google Play Console. As part of the updates announced for the Play Console at I/O 2017, Google mentions a new Device Catalog section under Release management that lets developers choose with intricate granularity which devices their app supports on the Play Store. Devices can be viewed and excluded by many attributes including RAM and SoC, but the important factor we're interested in is SafetyNet Attestation. New "Device catalog" lets devs manage the exclusions. Developers will be able to choose from 3 states shown in the top image: not excluding devices based on SafetyNet, excluding those that don't pass integrity, or excluding the latter plus those that aren't certified by Google. That means any dev could potentially block their apps from showing and being directly installable in the Play Store on devices that are rooted and/or running a custom ROM, as well as on emulators and uncertified devices (think Meizu and its not-so-legal way of getting Play Services and the Play Store on its phones). This is exactly what many of you were afraid would happen after the Play Store app started surfacing a Device certification status. This is different from the full SafetyNet API implementation that apps like Android Pay and Pokémon Go use. In the case of Pay/Go, the attestation check happens when the app is installed on your phone and doesn't allow it to run unless it passes the integrity test. But in the case of the Play Console, the attestation check happens when you're browsing the Play Store and only affects the availability of the app for your device. If the full SafetyNet API isn't included in the app itself, you will still be able to grab the APK from other sources, install it, and the app will work just fine. Still, this spells trouble for rooted users and the Android enthusiast community as a whole. Google keeps erecting more and more obstacles each day in the face of root and custom ROMs and even if this won't stop root users who should be knowledgable enough to know how/where to grab an APK and install it, it will make things more and more difficult and maybe less and less worth the trouble. But y'all are rebels and you'll keep on finding a way around it, won't you?

Nice move Google. Suicide_Note Not sure if serious, but either way, this was just a matter of time. YouNex Obviously not serious EowynCarter So, question : Is there anyway to get android O in the future on my nexus 6 and not having problems with this ? IF manufacturer where taking care of updating their devices, wouldn't be an issue... saf1927 If Magisk keeps working, yep. You can. Even my old Nexus 5 is on 7.1.2 and it passes SafetyNet. EowynCarter I want "just work" stuff. Not workaround. Maybe Magisk does the job for some, but not an acceptable solution from my point of view. Mainly the "we don't know if it will keep on working" part. saf1927 Well, it's the best solution so far and it has improved a lot since its inception. I never bothered since the Nexus 5 was a secondary device for me, but now that some apps won't show up anymore on the Play Store, I simply flashed Magisk and that's about it. I haven't tweaked anything. Plus, if you are already flashing a custom ROM, flashing an extra zip file isn't that much work anyway. EowynCarter True, but it's the phone I use dailly. I don't want apps sudendly not working, becasue google decided to push an update that broke magisk. mxwp well if you want things to "just work" then i guess get an iPhone EowynCarter Sadly, I'm beginning to think about that. But that would cause others frustrations. ED-Zが現れた! Well, people will just flock to root-supported apps... Milton P. I actually forgot when was the last time I Rooted a device. No biggie. Suicide_Note The bad thing is it isn't just root that causes problems. Simply unlocking the bootloader will produce the same result. Maxr1998 Just because it's no biggie for you, it doesn't mean everyone approves this. I am actually pretty concerned, because this limits the freedom over our devices even more.. Milton P. Define freedom, please. Maxr1998 Software freedom, to be more specific. You should have the freedom to use and modify your device and it's software however you'd like, and have fill control over it. That means, root access. And since the AOSP core IS free software, the 4 freedoms defined by Richard Stallman apply to it. What this change now introduces is that you're forced to decide between either giving up the freedom over your device or not using the app you wanted to download (which will probably have to be my choice, and that sucks). Milton P. But you're not giving up anything, you just have to make a choice. If you put that way, Google has the freedom of doing with the AOSP core whatever they want, the same way you can modify said core and do as you please, the difference is Google has more money and more responsibilities when it comes to their user base. XDA and other sites will still have a bunch of developers making whatever they please (within the AOSP terms) with the AOSP core. This will just change thinks for the people that use those ROMs bit realistically the vast majority of users won't feel the changes. Sad but true. h4rr4r That choice is giving up freedom you had before. The vast majority will see the rate of Android improvements slow as the Devs on XDA and the like lose interest. Android only exists because of Linux, now it is turning its back on that whole culture. Milton P. Well, I don't see your freedom compromised to be honest with you, but we're seeing things from different angles so that's that. Sorry for your loss in that case. h4rr4r You do not think losing control of your device is a loss of freedom? Milton P. Nope, is just a device, I have more important stuff going on, m device is a tool the same way a hammer is a tool, you can buy a hammer and use it as it is. Sometimes my device is a toy, if I buy a remote control car I'll modify it as long as it is possible, the same way I modify my phone. I have control over my phone. I can install whatever I want at my own risk. If I decide to root my phone I expect things to be broken. I remember when I had an HTC and I hated sense so I decided to install a custom ROM, I gave up the camera and I was aware of it. There was always some compromises with custom ROMs, nothing is changing. I rather have a safe device then a compromised one today, still my choice thou. h4rr4r So you want IOS. Got it. Over here I want freedom. I don't think homedepot should be allowed to tell me what I can hit with the hammer I bought. trparky Open platforms rarely stay open once they become popular. Once the Benjamins come rolling in it tends to override open. h4rr4r Tell that to Linus Torvalds. I am sure he will have many many fuck yous for you. trparky Linux is the rare situation. h4rr4r The rare situation like many others that created android and even google. trparky Yeah but look at Android, the walls are closing around it and there's nothing you can do about it. Face it man, the geeks may have built the system but the common man now rules it. Geeks love choice, yes, they do love their choice but your average person doesn't give a rat's ass about choice. All they want is a device that does what they need it to do when they want to do it. They have no inclination to learn how it works or why it works just as long as it does. This is what geeks do not and refuse to understand. h4rr4r Sure there is, stop using it. Then the common folks will have to follow us to the next platform. trparky As long as their is money involved in maintaining Android it doesn't matter if something better comes along, people will continue supporting Android because it makes them money. Money makes the world go round, get used to it. Maxr1998 ^ What @h4rr4r:disqus says. trparky Yep. The root and ROM community is such a small portion of the Android ecosystem that they really don't matter to them. People have been screaming at Google for years to get the Android house fixed up, this is them doing just that. You can't blame them for doing what the people have asked for. mxwp I agree with you, but sadly you only have freedom over hardware. You can do what you want with the device you buy. But with software you never actually buy it... you only buy a license to use it. Thus you have no real freedom with software. Maxr1998 Android is free software, Apache 2.0 license. At least the AOSP part of it. trparky But the Google parts of it are not covered under the Apache 2.0 license. That's essentially why ROM developers can't package the Google Play Services pack with the ROM itself and instead requires you to download a separate ZIP package from Google to install it separate from the ROM package. Android itself may be free and open but the Google Play Services part is not. Sudev There are far more than few arguments against root access but here are some: Root access is meant for experimental & development purpose and not for Daily Driver for any average user of the platform. Google Play Services & Apps available on Play Store are not "Free Software". Google as provider of Play Services infrastructure has much more liabilities then one can simply assume. And also the app developers have responsibility to protect end users' data. If device has root access available and any rouge app / maleware steals other apps data which is possible, who will be at stack? h4rr4r The ability to do anything I want with my things that I own. Milton P. You​ can do whatever you want with your device, nobody is stopping you. You might see that some apps are not showing up in the play store but you can still side load them, I still see freedom in your future. h4rr4r For how much longer? Soon these apps will ask play services if they are supposed to be installed on that device, at that point you can say goodbye to sideloading. If this is what people want then IOS was the platform for them. thecoolkid Ok Google, define freedom... 😁 Nick I would imagine a great deal of people on this site will be upset, but in actuality I don't think this will affect the user base of many apps that badly h4rr4r Not in the short term. However in the long term it will. Android only exists because of the FREE software movement. Nick Yes, but that doesn't apply to applications, which this is about. h4rr4r Think long term. Same thing applies. trparky No it won't because the root and ROM community is so small it doesn't matter to Google anymore. The 95% of people who simply want a device that works don't care and likely won't ever care. As long as they can play NetFlix, Pokemon Go, or whatever is the next craze they don't care. h4rr4r Again, that is short term thinking. Think past the end of your nose. Android exists because of linux. Google needs this small group to create the very stuff they rely on. trparky You overestimate the value that the community has now. Android may have needed the community back in the beginning to gain the foothold that it has in the market but not so anymore. Android has near 100% market penetration, they have achieved world domination. They don't need the community anymore, they have achieved their goals. h4rr4r Until they are unseated. IBM once had a monopoly on computing devices. They did not need the community to gain a foothold, they would not have a product to gain a foothold without the community. Android only exists because of a collection of those projects. trparky No, Android exists because Samsung, HTC, and LG make devices people want and it makes them money by the semi-truck full. The community doesn't mean shit now, all that matters to these companies is one thing... money, money, and more money. Oh, and did I mention money? This is capitalism man, money rules the world. If you don't make money you are dead. h4rr4r Please tell me how that would have happened without linux. Money loses to good engineering every day. Look at how linux killed solaris. trparky Tell me why Windows is the defacto monopoly on the desktop despite the fact that Linux is better in every damn way possible under the hood? That's right... money. h4rr4r Because the desktop is dead. The fight is over. They lost. Even money can't keep them relevant. trparky Oh, you're funny. The desktop is not dead, it will never be dead. When people need to do real work, they sit down at a desktop. When people want to play real games, they sit down at a desktop. When people need to type out anything longer than a page like a college term paper, they sit down at a desktop. The desktop is king and will always be king. Long live the desktop! h4rr4r The Desktop is a dead man walking. When they do real work, they use a Citrix session. When they game they use a console, or they are already nerds. When people type they can use a fucking chromebook. The desktop as you think of it died already. trparky Try and say that shit over at TechPowerUp, HardOCP, Overclock.net, TomsHardware, etc. and trust me when I say this... you'll be run out of town by people with pitchforks and torches. h4rr4r Those are all nerds. Those are the folks who have desktops running 3 different OSes. They are the folks who are pissed about android being locked down. trparky And your point being? You just admitted that only the "nerds" care about Android being open. Sure, those same "nerds" will go off and create a new platform but the rest of the people who are living in the real world and who don't care one damn bit about how it works will continue to use Android. h4rr4r Those people will eventually move to the new platform. Just like they did with Android. trparky And the same thing will happen to that platform in the future that's happening to Android now. Open platforms are nice and all, I'll admit that, but your average person doesn't care one bit. I dare you to go up to any person on the street and ask them anything about Android. What phone do they have? What model? Most will say "I don't know, something that my carrier gave me for cheap." h4rr4r The wheel of computing we call it. It has happened and will happen again. So what? trparky Which reinforces the idea that I said before, eventually all open systems will become closed (or less open) at some point in their life cycle. It usually happens when it becomes popular with the common man. Why? Because like I've been trying to get through your thick skull, the average person doesn't care how any of this stuff works so long as it works. h4rr4r The average person does not matter. Few open systems become closed. AOSP is still fine. trparky What the hell do you mean by "they don't matter"? They're the ones buying the devices, buying the apps, looking at the ads, etc. Just how the fuck does that translate to "they don't matter"? h4rr4r Because they don't. They don't create, they don't cause new things to be created. They are just users, just like I don't matter to how movies are created. trparky But without money from the people who are consuming said things developers won't make new stuff. Developers do have to eat you know and put a roof over their heads. h4rr4r The giant world of FOSS pretty much proves you wrong. Demand cannot create supply. I don't pirate anything kiddo. I have way too much to lose for that. One of those lawsuits I would actually have to pay, since I could. trparky I'll give a hint on how FOSS works a lot of the time. Some of the top tier Linux kernel developers actually work for companies and they just contribute code in their free time. They may work for Intel, AMD, nVidia, or God knows what but only after their day job is done. Why? Because they need money and they need to eat. This is a basic requirement for people in this world. They need money!!! People don't just write code for the love of it, even Linus Torvalds who's in charge of the Linux kernel itself works for the Linux Foundation and yes, he gets paid for his work to the tune of $10 Million a year. Sorry to burst your bubble man but FOSS projects aren't all happy, happy, joy, joy here... people need to be paid real money to be able to eat, drive a car, put a roof over their heads, etc. On second thought, I'm not sorry I burst your bubble! You need it burst! PEOPLE NEED TO BE PAID REAL FUCKING MONEY!!!! h4rr4r No, they get paid to contribute. During the work day. Not as a hobby. Lots of projects are like that. I won't say exactly how I know about that ;) Their employers just aren't as short sighted as you. Linus did not however create linux to get rich. Great code like great art gets created because it must be. People do what they love. Kid, you will get it one day. When you have enough that you aren't worried about it each day, money stops being that big of a deal. Don't worry everybody goes through a phase like you are now. trparky Dude, we are not the Federation of Planets here living in a happy, happy, joy, joy world in which people can just do whatever they want to do without a care in the world. As long as human greed exists there will always be a need for money. And believe you me, greed will never go away unless we breed a new kind of human and I don't see that happening any time soon. Gene Roddenberry's future will never happen, it just won't. Contrary to a lot of geek dreams it just won't. h4rr4r No idea where you got that idea. Never suggested it. My point was the personal relative value of increasing income drops as income goes up. If you make minimum wage doubling your income is a huge deal. Adding the same amount to my income would not get me to take a job I like less. Offering it to Linus would be a waste of time. Yes, some people will keep chasing dollars, they are the exception not the rule. The employers are working on enlightened self interest. Either they use the FOSS product, gain market advantage with direct knowledge, use it for marketing or believe they are getting something else. PostgreSQL for example has a lot of paid contributors who work for companies that either provide customization, consulting or depend on the project. Others just because it increases quality. Commercial software by and large is not high quality. I have seen a lot of it and 90% if you tried to submit it to a FOSS project of any size would get you denied and possibly mocked. This system continues to be more innovative because it is easy to continue to expand. Anyone with a good idea can fork if their idea is not accepted. trparky > My point was the personal relative value of increasing income drops as income goes up. Tell that to the people in Washington or any CEO that demands ever increasing yearly salaries and end of year bonuses all while raping the companies that they work for. Tell that to the psychopaths on Wall Street. For as long as their is money, people will want more of it. Anyone who says that they don't is flat out lying. h4rr4r Those are the exception not the rule. That is why you call them psychopaths. Honestly, correcting for inflation I really don't care that much if I ever make more. Would it be nice sure, would I give up anything I like about my job? No. If you could double my income but it prevented me from contributing to FOSS projects or owning code I generate off the clock, I would not take that deal. If money was enough to make people do anything MS would have offered Linus $11 million a year to not write it. Heck, Sun would have done it while they were still around. trparky Either you're a child that doesn't know how the adult world works or you're a fucking troll. h4rr4r So you have no idea who makes stuff, neat. I guess you think Henry Ford should have made a faster horse. trparky Oh, I know who makes the stuff I use but I also make sure that they are paid! I give money to those developers who write the programs that I enjoy and if I can't pay them I won't use their programs. I only use a program if I can pay for it. I have put money into their tip jars on their web site, I look for PayPal links and I donate even if it's something small like $5. They deserve it! h4rr4r Good for you! There is a lot of great software that does not make money that way. Some even just ask is that you follow the license, like linux which mediatek steals by not releasing kernel source. So I hope you avoid buying that kind of thing. trparky MediaTek controller chips are known to suck so I don't buy them out of that reason alone. h4rr4r Now I have given you another good reason to avoid them. Bunch of thieves. Rita El Khoury I don't even remember when I last bootloader unlocked. But I know this move toward closing the ecosystem further and further will have ripples in the future. The enthusiast community flocked toward Android for its openness and we have custom ROMs and their enterprising devs to thank for HUNDREDS of new features that they implemented first and everyone clamored for and applauded until they became features in AOSP. If Google thinks it can steer this ship alone and it knows best what to do next, we may have less and less interesting features in the future and more and more of what only one entity thinks is best, not a diverse set of opinions. Nick Given that this only gives the developer the option of requiring these checks, it makes me believe that Google had to do this for some companies that have regulatory or other kinds of requirements. Which is a shame for the rooted (and unlocked?) community, but understandable. Shame Google is most likely going to take the blame here in this comment section though. Rita El Khoury Well, maybe they had to, but that won't stop any developer from implementing it without any regulatory or legal requirement pushing them to do so. Nick Right, which puts this choice on the developer, not Google. Google was stuck behind a rock and hard place, perhaps. EowynCarter Well, google is certainly to blame for not planing to update my nexus 6 to android O. And now I can't even use custom rom as plan B without losing some apps :( Suicide_Note Boo hoo. Buy a new phone and quit crying that Google doesn't support phones forever. EowynCarter Fine can you order a pixel XL and ship it to me in France ? Plus, my nexus 6 still works, I hate having to replace working stuff. Makes no sense, economically and ecologically speaking. Suicide_Note I'll sell you my XL when I'm done with it, but only after i get the Pixel XL 2. :) EowynCarter Well, I do hope Google sells the "pixel 2 "( or whatever its name) here. For now, I'm'just hoping my nexus 6 don't break. Else I might jump on the iOS ship. I'm not convinced the the other android alternatives. Note 8 would be the closest, but touchwiiz, delayed updates.... I'm spoiled after a few years with a nexus. Suicide_Note There always eBay or Swappa if you want to get a first gen Pixel. I was looking at prices over the weekend, and mint condition Pixels are going for about $450. EowynCarter Not so much in France. And eBay for suff that cost more that a few bucks, too risky. Plus, the pixel is getting "old" by now. Wilton Daniel Pinto Troll found trparky Yet Microsoft still supports Windows 7 EIGHT YEARS LATER! How come Microsoft can do that yet Google can't? Alex Louderback Actually, that's Qualcomm EowynCarter Source for this ? trparky And Qualcomm can go fuck themselves. Gee... I wonder why they're being hit with an anti-trust lawsuit. Could this be one of many reasons why? trparky Yes, Google is to blame for that. There's no damn reason why your Nexus 6 can't run Android O other than the fact that they just don't want to. Bojan Bunić My bootloader was unlocked prior to changing the mobo on my 5X, courtesy of Booty Loops. Root, well, probably before I got my Nexus 4. Although I'll see how it'll go on in the future, as we don't have Pixels here, so the only near stock possibility is either OnePlus, or some other device and a custom ROM. Milton P. Agree 100% with you, I mean I remember the old days when I hated HTC's Sense, I literally decided that a phone without a camera was better than whatever HTC did back then, but Android has evolved quite a lot nowadays, don't get me wrong, I do believe that custom ROMs did a great job showing Google what the users want but that won't change, as long as someone shows Google what people want Google will keep improving Android, because there's no limits. Now if they go the Apple way and lock EVERYTHING then we'll be fucked, I'm the meantime developers will find a way around the system pushing Google along. Premsuraj An open bootloader and root actually solves a lot of problems still existing in AOSP. The Nougat update absolutely destoryed the battery life of many Nexus 6P devices, with Google only focussing on the Pixels, there was no fix in it. I unlocked, used Franco Kernel + naptime + Greenify and I now I get adequate battery life. Another feature I can think of is theming. Material design is good, but the whiteness is rage inducing Maxr1998 Well, fuck them. Let's just hope not many devs will use this, and Google won't enable this by default anytime soon. Maxr1998 The more I think about this, the more concerned I get. This will reduce the freedom over our devices, and also limit developers in the awesome things they could do before because of Android's openness. I am all in for device security and fighting against malware, trojans and phishing applications, don't understand me wrong, but that doesn't mean that you have to take people away their freedom - just look at how Linux (GNU and Linux) is doing it. Tom Westrick How does this limit developers? If anything it gives them more control. Maxr1998 Fair point, I should have been more specific. With "developers", I meant rom developers and modders, app developers only if they require root access for their apps. "Normal" developers can use this to enforce a "secure" (read: DRM locked-down) environment, but that's not really a good thing in my opinion.. (Refer to my other comments.) trparky You're angry at the wrong people, you should be angry at Hollywood; they're the ones that are demanding this kind of stuff. Their content, their rules; it's how things are in the real world. They have to do what they need to do to protect their investments, plain and simple. We don't necessarily have to like it, hell... we may even hate it, but that's how it is. You want the content? Play by their rules. Colin Richardson If you are an app developer and want your app to run on custom roms..... don't turn on "Requires SafetyNet"... bekifft We are increasingly living in the future Richard Stallman warned us about. With Google taking all these steps, may as well go back to using jailbroken iPhones. Bart Janusz I've already enabled it and I know at least 3 others devs that did it as well. I really don't care about root per se, but custom roms and xposed is source of countless problem as both are buggy as hell. Maxr1998 But in which way does that influence you? Xposed can introduce bugs to the system, sure, but it won't affect the performance of your app unless it itself is modded, so you probably don't have to fear bad reviews for bad performance anyway. And custom roms? LineageOS on my mother's Moto G runs like a champ and much better than the 5.1 stock rom before. And in my experience as a dev, there were much more incompatibilities with Samsung TouchWiz than with AOSP-based custom roms. refthemc I'm sure he's just trying to avoid the headache of emails he gets daily from users who have no idea that it's their fault the app is not working or crashing... Bart Janusz Indeed, not to mention extra crash and ANRs reports which seems to influence app positioning. Maxr1998 But why? The device may behave more buggy at some parts because of Xposed (and mine definitely ran like shit on MM because of some mods, but I NEVER blamed any apps), but the apps itself won't run worse if not modded - normally they should even run better if you only use performance mods like Greenify, NLP Collector wakelock disabler and other light mods. I don't think he gets many reports anyway, considering what @marcusmarcus2:disqus said. Bart Janusz You may not, but many users do, and as I said there are a lot of bogus ANRs and crash reports. Since my app depends heavily on low level OS elements both custom ROMs and xposed are deal breakers (and you really should check source, since I do not update my website as I moved to G+/FB but app has sizable user base given its niche and I'd to deal with ROM/xposed issues fequently). Maxr1998 Well, but the same type of users also give bad reviews etc. without using any mod or root. You generalize modders to only cause problems, and therefore lock out everyone. About your app/website thing: fair point, I didn't look at it yet, and have to apologize for being a little rude. marcusmarcus2 You need to take your own advice, "you really should check source". If you moved to G+/FB, then why does your app on the play store still point to the same website as well. Or at least put a link on the old website that directs to G+/FB. There is nothing that points to your so called G+/FB source. So @Maxr1998:disqus has no other source to check at the moment. Bart Janusz Not that I care but if you try to draw conclusion about app you should probably visit Play Store listing. Anyhow that's really not important I just chimed in to explain why developer will use this. I've choose to do so due to extra burden which in effect hurts majority of my user base, one of my colleagues cited lucky patcher and freedom (which I think is not such a good idea but its his choice). trparky You may not blame the apps because you know better but most people don't understand that, most people see a crashing app and suddenly you see, as the developer, a ton of comments saying that your app sucks. h4rr4r Please do tell us about your apps so we can be sure to avoid them on any devices we have not yet rooted. marcusmarcus2 His disqus profile leads to this website http://artflowstudio.com/ which has a few apps listed. Art oriented apps. There is only 1 update on that website since 2014, so I don't think I would be to concerned about installing one of his apps. Jordan Palmer Nice detective work. Adrian I can see a lot of refund requests coming from people who paid for apps and suddenly are told "Nope. Not for you anymore." A lot of us are rooted and buy apps and you'd better believe noise will be made if an app I use daily, that I paid for, suddenly breaks with an update because it's no longer blessed by the dev to run on my device. It's your app and you can do what you want with it, but there is always another side to the coin. BAlGaInTl That's not the way that Netflix worked it, and I doubt other developers of paid apps would either. I have a OnePlus One, that I run Lineage OS on since the original Cyanogen OS is now defunct and does not receive any updates. Netflix simply doesn't update to v 5+. It still works just fine. I may not get the newest and latest features, but part of that is on me for using a device that is dated. I'm not one of those users who, because I paid for an app once, fells that I should get all of the updates from now until the end of time. That isn't sustainable for developers. It could very well be that Netflix has some new features/offerings in the works in which they are getting pressure from outside sources to push this. A lot of valid reasons for a developer to enable the check exist. As long as they do it in the same manner that Netflix has, I don't see the issue. Adrian And just like Pokemon Go, eventually you'll get a message that you need to upgrade to the latest version or the app won't work, you know, that new version that won't let you actually log into it anymore. We've already seen this happen so let's not pretend that it isn't the next logical step. They aren't going to keep letting people sign in indefinitely with an app that doesn't have the security level they want. It's naive to think that hey I can just stick with the last version that works for root. It takes all of what, the time it takes to create a switch that says minimum version required to log in is "DRM version" BAlGaInTl Good Point. I recognize that. But it seems that the blame (in general) is being directed at Google in many of these posts. If that scenario happens, it isn't Google that blocked you from accessing Netflix. The need for this level of security is on the increase. The same users demanding better security and longer updates are the first ones to cry foul when Google starts laying the groundwork for exactly what they have asked for. Adrian I think there is a way to do both that doesn't piss off a very active community that helped take Android from a very very very ugly, second class OS to what we have now. I know a lot of us remember just how crippled Android was and it was the root/mod community that produced the bulk of what is now standard on Android. There needs to be a way to secure the devices AND not turn their back on the developer community that contributes. The idea, in Netflix's case, that root = pirate is insane. Why in the world would someone prefer to rip content on their phone to say a computer or XBox that is never going to move and can do it while you get on with your life? They're doing something for the sake of saying they're doing something, but if they think it's going to make a dent in piracy they, and the studios are nuts. I watch a lot of Netflix and still prefer to buy discs. People who do things the right way and are perfectly happy paying for content shouldn't have to jump through hoops to watch it. Those of us who root usually have a handful of things that stock Android is not doing for us. It's why we root. If all of these things were available in stock, my reasons for rooting would disappear but I don't see that happening any time soon. I think Android is getting so much better but if they make it exactly like iOS, might as well go to the dark side because Apple's apps tend to be more polished, come out first and OS updates are frequent. Don't bite the hand that feeds you just because you're getting more popular. BAlGaInTl I think that Netflix is a good example. It is HIGHLY likely that the reason for recent unpopular changes (see also VPN blocking) are being driven by other entities. It isn't that Netflix thinks its a problem, but the people that control a large portion of their content do. root pirate but it does introduce a security risk. I don't see how Google is turning their backs on developers. Developers are free to develop as they see fit and choose (at least for the moment) whether or not they will implement the SafetyNet check. The inherent problem is that a circumvented security is still circumvented and can no longer be considered secure. I can clearly see why some apps would and should frown upon that. Maybe not Netflix and Mario (IMHO), but certainly something like bank and payment apps. I don't think the inherent open nature of android will ever reduce to the level of iOS. But some changes have to occur to meet the needs/desire of the majority. Security is inherently difficult. The easier and more flexible you try to make it, the less secure it becomes. Adrian I do think banking apps should run in a secure space. Completely agree with that, but I disagree with root = less secure. My nexus devices stopped getting OS and security updates. Nothing. VERY insecure and dangerous. I rooted them, updated the OS with images from XDA developers and my devices that were once easy targets are more secure. There is always two sides to it. I see that Google is finally trying to take security seriously on Android and doing things in layers that completely cut out the vendor AND the carriers is the right step. Right now, Root is the only way to update a perfectly good device like my Nexus tablet tablet that the vendor said "oh well" to. Until Google has a REAL strategy in place to keep ALL Android devices secure, root will be necessary. Not everyone wants to or can upgrade devices every two years because they get abandoned. My father doesn't need an S8. He does need a device that gets security updates for more than a year after purchasing his phone. BAlGaInTl You are exactly correct, and I'm in the same situation with my OnePlus One. But in working to increase your security level, you leave holes behind. The key words that you used are "more secure." I agree. You are "more secure." But still (probably) less secure than a device that has been thoroughly tested, certified, and passes SafetyNet without hacks. Google has been open that they are working on security updates. They have improved significantly over the last couple years in getting those out. I feel that they are putting in place a real strategy to keep Android devices secure. This is part of that groundwork. I also feel that they are actively looking to replace Android in it's current state, and I can't say I blame them. The only real strategy may be to take lessons learned and start over. Lucky for them, they have the resources to do so. trparky > take lessons learned and start over Pretty much. The worst thing that they did from the very beginning was to allow for the OEMs to do what they wished. Google essentially made a deal with the devil when they released Android to the world. They wrote no requirements into the Android agreements that the OEMs agreed to to require updates to be a necessary thing. Big mistake Google. BAlGaInTl The really needed to in order to get their foot in the door of the market. If it would not have been open source from the beginning, none of the major manufactures would have bought off on it. The fact that they could use it for free (essentially) and still be able to customize on top of it is what sold it. trparky And now look at it, Android is a fucking mess of non-updated insecure devices that are ripe for anyone to be able to take over and turn into a botnet. trparky And you should be raising holy hell with the OEM that made that device! Just because your device is old doesn't mean that it shouldn't still be supported. Windows 7 is nearly eight years old and it still receives Windows Updates. Why can't your device? BAlGaInTl Normally, I would agree, but the OnePlus One is a special case. The OEM operating system is the now defunct Cyanogen OS. I had to balance having the original OS without updates, or running another with updates. The phone is now almost three years old. If I bought a PC with Windows on it three years ago, and Microsoft had since gone out of business, should the PC manufacturer be responsible for providing Windows 7 updates? Even though the PC is beyond it's support date? Sure, I can increase the security by switching to another OS that is updated. It may even be a Windows clone. But if a software developer decided to only support "original, unmodified" PC configurations, that would be within their right. trparky But it can be adapted to run LineageOS. Sudev There is bit difference in analogy here: OnePlus manufactured the phone and Cynogen Inc customized AOSP Android OS for it, they didn't developed it from ground up. I understand that Cynogen INC is out of business now too. However in PC world, it would be the case that you purchased a PC from Dell and get Microsoft Windows OS with some additional Dell software. If Dell or developer of that custom software goes out of business you still get OS update for your PC. Its not android OS itself out business here. Adrian and for the record, I absolutely agree that it was the content providers and not all on Netflix. trparky You should be demanding that OnePlus send an official update to your device. So what if your device is old? It should be still supported. Windows 7 is still supported nearly eight years later, why can't your device be supported for that long as well? Plumplam Who cares except for a bunch of XDA nerds? If it means better security then I'm all for it. Dmitri Smirnov Well, for starters, it doesn't mean better security, since it does nothing to address the problems with vulnerable outdated android versions that will be "certified", but will allow malicious apps to quietly escalate their privileges and do their dirty work, but will block "uncertified" custom roms that actually have all the recent secuirity patches and give user full control over who has root access and how. Also, "bunch of XDA nerds" are the source of a lot of features that had their trial run in custom ROMs and then were adopted to the AOSP. Should I remind you of "The Oak and the Pig" fable? Alienate the developers bringing new ideas to the ecosystem - lose the competetive edge you had over other OSes saf1927 Actually, custom ROMs never really have the latest security patches despite what they claim since kernels aren't maintained and no proprietary blobs is updated anymore. If ROM developers were OEMs, they'd be violating their agreements with Google by bumping the patch level without actually addressing all the vulnerabilities. Dmitri Smirnov Well they patch the AOSP to the same level as latest official one and kernel - if it's possible to do so without breaking the compatibility with compiled blobs or at least on the level of latest official firmware. So in the end run it's at least as secure as the official firmware, often - much more so. saf1927 If you look at the security bulletin, most vulnerabilities come from proprietary drivers and require these to be updated. On a supported device, these are provided by the chip manufacturers to the OEMs, on an unsupported device they aren't updated anymore. A custom ROM can only fix userspace security issues. In the end, bumping the patch level without addressing all vulnerabilities in that patch gives a false sense of security to users. Dmitri Smirnov If anything, this is an argument for forcing OEMs to opensource their blobs. For some reason community is much better at releasing the fixes for what they can change (userspace), while OEMs generally stop caring as soon as device is out the door. saf1927 The problem goes beyond OEMs unfortunately. All the phones you can buy are assembled with off-the-shelf components that they buy from other manufacturers and it is them that provide the binary blobs to the OEMs. If they stop supporting components, the OEMs can't do anything. For the chip, it's companies like Qualcomm, Samsung, Mediatek etc. that need to support it with up-to-date drivers. Once they stop, the life-cycle of a phone comes to an end. trparky And that is probably one of many reason why Qualcomm is facing a nice fat anti-trust lawsuit. Serves them right. trparky That ain't ever going to happen. There's no way they're going to allow for their intellectual property to be open for all the world to see and have it cracked open. It would be corporate suicide since their competitors would be able to reverse engineer their stuff. Suicide_Note Never heard of "The Oak and the Pig" before. Could you tell me more? Seriously. Dmitri Smirnov http://www.aliceswonderland.eu/Alice-ska350-en.html Maxr1998 Ah, Lessing. Going to read the original version in a minute :) username_not_valid Thats a very generous view of the custom ROM community. It might be true of a few, very few devs, but most ROMs are unsupported garbage with serious security issues. Dmitri Smirnov Maybe so, but out of this cesspool of garbage CyanogenMod was born, which became LineageOS. I'd say their quality standard appeals me more than a lot of OEMs. username_not_valid Cyanogen and Lineage was what i had in mind.. Each to his own i guess. BAlGaInTl Yes and no. I run Lineage on my OnePlus One because Cyanogen OS is no longer supported. I can say with certainty that Lineage introduces stability issues that I have to deal with to be up to date. Wilton Daniel Pinto Ninna pooty bewarci Qwip Consider the bigger picture. Right now, users are being shuffled into a situation where they must restrict the control they have over their device if they want to be able to use Netflix (and presumably banking apps will follow soon). That may seem fine, and from some security perspective it is probably a good thing. How much control do you have over your _laptop_? How much do you want? Right now, we're blissfully able to install unsigned software on our computers (although various OSs will complain about it), but will that last? How long will it be before we can only open our banking interface on our laptop using a trusted, digitally signed browser on a machine that is using secure boot and can only run signed binaries? I can understand the direction that Netflix (and others) are coming from, and to them it may even make sense. The question is: what is the cost of ceding control over our devices/machines in order to be able to watch netflix, etc. trparky Yeah and that's why Windows is the virus filled cesspool that it is today. Windows 10 is slowly changing Windows to be an app store based ecosystem in which all apps will be sandboxed. It's coming to the desktop near you. saf1927 I hope Magisk (or other similar mods in the future) keep working, so to prevent this. Not a problem on my Pixel XL since I haven't rooted it, but on my Nexus 5 Magisk allows it to pass Safety Net even though it's running a custom ROM (7.1.2) and it's rooted. Hendrik Leppkes SafetyNets primary purpose is to secure devices for Android Pay, and when you deal with actual money transactions on your device, you really don't want any hack interfering with it - so I'm quite certain they'll do whatever they can to break hacks like this and ensure the security and integrity of the device. h4rr4r No, its primary purpose is to make the device trustworthy for others not the person who paid for it. This is how it makes it "secure" for android pay. You are a possible threat and this closes that. Suicide_Note It would seem that Google is erecting a wall around their garden, too. EowynCarter While Apple opens iOS more and more. YouNex According to the support/help page, a device is not certified if it stops getting Android updates. How fuck up is that ? I don't get it. My Moto X has always been on stock ROM, yet it's showing up as non certified. Yes it's rooted + system modifications, but at no point is it stated that root prevents it from being certified. Suicide_Note Really? You can't understand why your rooted/system modified device is non-certified? YouNex I know how to read, but this is vague https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/b6f710b8628f0e09ab73ba144c133a2c9b1fe1325b353ae7dc1636f2776b2ac0.png "Not secure" jonzey231 Root and/or unlocked bootloader = Not certified. YouNex It says nothing about root or bootloader https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/b6f710b8628f0e09ab73ba144c133a2c9b1fe1325b353ae7dc1636f2776b2ac0.png ast00 Can't wait until LastPass excludes root users... Fuck them. Adonis K. If they do, I'm cancelling my subscription... Naxx ENVY Fuck them and yet they haven't done anything yet ... #internetlogic Also i know right , crazy for a company that stores your passwords to make themselves more secure . ABSOLUTE CRAZY , RAGE RAGE RAGE Jordan Palmer I don't understand your reasoning or rationale for these two statements. ast00 The second part is related to Google. Sorry about the confusion. Believe it or not, most of us root users keep SELinux in it's Enforcing state. This means we are safe. Nothing gets root rights without us knowing. Our phones are just as safe if not safer than most stock phones. JATIN BANSAL SafetyNet test can be passed using Magisk Manager. I am using it and it works fine for me. Even in play store, my device is certified. May be this helps someone. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/3756499ff5876545740cd0e88e38961bb2c327d90fc43f5801f4bce5d802c990.png https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/44185f640490cb506a68a3414579bd345123f7d52ee2e11802d31d5141db11ae.png Nick Most people are worried about the future when the exploits that Magisk uses are patched and it continues to make it harder for people to get around this. JATIN BANSAL That's what I am also worried about. I just posted this for those who are already rooted and for now want to keep the root. My main purpose of rooting was to flash lineage OS. I think custom rom is the only way of staying updated to latest version of Android as google itself doesn't update their phones after 2 years (18 months I think) for reasons they have. I think if someone buys a flagship device which costs 700$+, it should have 3-4 years of full software update support. 😆😄 2 years of major OS version updates and 3 years of security patches. After 3 years, its time to buy a new phone cuz its so old anyway. trparky Says you! Windows 7 was released on July 22, 2009 and they still support it EIGHT YEARS LATER! And they plan on supporting it until the year 2020 which means it will be supported for a total of ELEVEN YEARS! If Microsoft can do it, Google can too!!! Does Microsoft suddenly say "Your machine is too old, go buy a new one"? No, they continue to give you Windows Updates for years later. We should also be demanding that the Android OEMs do so as well. A Samsung Note 5 has more than enough hardware in it to run Android 7 but no... we can't do that, we need to make money so we don't update them to force you to buy a new device. Lambdadelta Magisk...alright, thanks for the tip-off. I really must get it. TadMSTR Magisk doesn't always pass SafetyNet. I have some devices it fails on. However, several other devices it works just fine. Make sure you turn on the hide root option, it's off by default. Lambdadelta Well, I do have a problem, and that is my device is not able to download it directly from Google Play, so I have to get the APK from XDA. I dunno why this is the case for my phone though. Is it because it's a 4.4.4? Either way, I'll get the APK moved to my phone later tonight. Teodor Axel Johan Jönsson I have activated hide root option, and it passes SafetyNet, but in Google Play Store, it still shows uncertified. What app should I hide root from to get Play Store to show Certified? JATIN BANSAL As per XDA: Q: Safety Net fails after enabling MagiskHide A: Magisk can only hide Magisk core features, for Magisk modules it depends on what the module does. If your ROM itself is not able to pass SafetyNet, then there is nothing Magisk can help. Your best bet is 100% stock ROMs, because your phone manufacturer is forced to release a device passing CTS. Teodor Axel Johan Jönsson What in Magisk Hide did you check/how did you do it? Google Play Store? Or Play services? Because here it says uncertified :( JATIN BANSAL Just clear app data of play store. Now it will show your device certified Teodor Axel Johan Jönsson Thanks! Muzaffar I believe that root and custom rom makes android what it is now. This feels like betrayal for Android enthusiast. username_not_valid Well maybe in the very early days (maybe), but not any more. Rooted phones make up a tiny fraction of active devices. Muzaffar It's not about active devices. It's about how android develop together with community (well as i remember) I believe that those "rooted user" contribute many things that make android right now. I still remember status bar (and nav bar) color change was implemented on Kitkat before it becomes official on lollipop. Also, we can't forget how badly mobile active network bug happens in lollipop if it's not those "rooted user" who found out the fix via xposed. and i believe there are still more. trparky We can blame the OEMs for that kind of stuff because of things like locked bootloaders, eFuses, etc. username_not_valid Or we can blame ROM makers for it because they kept breaking the devices causing warranty claims. Naxx ENVY no offence but that's small thinking ... i'd say 90% of people on Android devices don't want or even know about root, heck it may even be 95% ... security is more of a concern, sure it annoys us geeks, but that's the 5% at most. Muzaffar And about half of android devices is left outdated. Not to mention bugs that unsolved on previous android. I'll pick a dumb phone instead, if android becomes a closed platform. trparky And truth be told that's why I have an iPhone. I simply got sick and tired of the lack of updates so I told myself I'm going to the iPhone and have been happy ever since. OK sure, it may not have all of the customization features that Android has but I can be guaranteed that I will get software and security updates on time, every time, regardless of my carrier of choice. refthemc I think you misread his comment, he's saying that root and custom roms got Android to where it is TODAY not saying that it is necessary TODAY. And I agree. trparky It pretty much comes down to this. Google is simply targeting a much larger piece of the pie. You can't blame them for trying to do what is necessary to protect not only the platform but the Android brand itself. Qwip Well, it isn't like there is anywhere else to go though, is it? Google can basically throw enthusiasts who have promoted and fostered android development under the bus - they don't need them any more. trparky Money trumps community. Always has, always will. username_not_valid Ad blocking was the last holdout reason to root for me, but even thats no longer a good reason with things like Adhell, Adguard etc I have no other reason to root now, custom ROMs are generally garbage, and bloat can usually be uninstalled or disabled, so its just not needed. Adonis K. custom ROMs have nothing to do with root... thevigilante Custom ROMs have uncertified flag in Play Store Mike Avellanosa Not all, though George Byers My Nexus 7 2013 is passing safteynet running Lineage unrooted. Wilton Daniel Pinto Let me guess, you have a Pixel. Or you wouldn't call custom ROMs bloated while the reality is other way round username_not_valid Wouldn't touch a Pixel actually. username_not_valid Should be noted that I didn't call custom ROMs bloated, I guess you misread it. Wilton Daniel Pinto Oh yeah, I misread it . My bad Zach Mauch This is going to cause the same problem I see in governments work with security. They will blindly block things like root and bootloader unlock regardless of if it poses any credible threat because it FEELS more secure. Blah!!!!!! Naxx ENVY it IS more secure, not just " feels" h4rr4r More secure for them, not for me the owner of the device. Besides, not even for them in the long term. An up to date ROM has many exploits patched that a two versions out of date and 12 months behind on security patches OTA has. Zach Mauch What I mean is they will apply restrictions because they easily can and it gives a warm fuzzy for them. They will do this regardless of the impact to the user. The analogy here is that in my job I am constantly unnecessary restrictions and bureaucracy that make doing my job much more difficult. For instance, we are disallowed from using remote desktop on standalone computer networks. It would make our job MUCH MUCH easier in many circumstances and save money on software as I could remote into my PC from anywhere in the building. Yet they deny us that and claim security. jonzey231 So this will force people to install apps from unauthorized sources, thus making the whole Android malware issue that much more prevalent. Great.. Suicide_Note Unless being held at gunpoint, no one is forced to install apps from unauthorized sources. That's a user's CHOICE. jonzey231 You know what I mean. Stop playing devil's advocate on everyone's posts. Eric Braun He's not incorrect. Kyle R Krcmaric "Stop providing an alternate viewpoint to my own." It's just comments. Anyway, I think Google also announced that even sideloaded apps will get scanned by their new Google Play Protect service, which may help nullify the risk of sideloading in the first place. d0x360 That's not an alternate viewpoint unless your view is "don't install any apps ever" There is no logical argument to defend this move by Google. None. username_not_valid Yes there is. Come content creators will not allow a provider to support a rooted or otherwise compromised device. Right or wrong in your eyes thats the reality, and in order for Android to be able to have such services Google have to do this. d0x360 What you said isn't an alternate viewpoint lol you are just repeating the reason Google is doing this which everyone agrees is a fact. As for this new comment...a rooted phone isn't compromised. Tell me...what would a rooted user do with Netflix that would make Netflix want to block them? Are they worried about people copying movies because if they think Android is the vector for that action they are idiots. All they are doing is making a problem by allowing bad actors to inject malware into a Netflix apk that could be installed by both root and unrooted users. Genius! Give me 1 good reason to block rooted phones from an app like oh I dunno, Mario run or whatever it's called. Any answers you give are false. Wanna know why? Hacked apks exist to allow cheating and they can be installed by anyone rooted or not. In fact I'd stake my life that your average unrooted user is installing more modified apk files to cheat in games or whatever than any rooted user. People who root are generally better educated about the Android eco system and do less dumb stuff. As for Netflix I cancelled my account on the day they did this and now I just use a friends account so they lost a subscriber due to this move and I rarely ever used the app. Sure 1 person closing an account that's existed since the day they opened isn't going to do much but I vote with my wallet and if a company does something I dislike then they simply don't get my money. The first person I asked gave me their login info and I made a profile. It's just like how I share my HBO subscription with someone else. Easy easy. username_not_valid See my previous comment. Its not for me to argue, the fact is content providers want it, fair or not, end of story, therefore its going to happen. The tiny number of rooters out there are meaningless to them, and Google. Netflix has to do this because the providers of its non-original content demand it. Its not Netflix fault, they either do it or lose shows. Losing large amounts of their content would affect their subscription base several orders of magnitude more than losing rooted users, who chances are, use the service on more than their phone or tablet anyway. d0x360 Once again I ask... what about a rooted device is dangerous to an app and also this is now a second question, what makes it compromised? BAlGaInTl Clearly you've made up your mind on the issue, but I'll give it a go. It isn't necessarily the root that is dangerous to an app or vice versa. The compromise comes from other apps/processes that can take advantage of root. If you don't understand that, then you don't understand what root really is. It has a lot of valuable uses, but it can also be dangerous. To address your previous statement, just because it rubs me the wrong way. So your "solution" was to cancel your Netflix account and then steal the content? So clearly, you aren't "actually" affected by the change, because you can still watch Netflix. You do realize that watching their content is also valuable to them and makes them money? If you want to boycott Netflix for their practices, then by all means do. Otherwise, it just comes across as hypocritical IMHO. d0x360 I don't believe I asked you. No I'm not stealing Netflix content, it's being paid for and Netflix has many times in the past encouraged account sharing. Of course they did so in the hopes you would join but they still allow it. I paid my Netflix dues. Day 1 4 disc member, then as soon as it was available I upgraded to the 4k 4 user package. It's not piracy either, I'm not recording or distributing the content. If Netflix wants to dick with me I'll dick with them. I never said this was permanent but I vote with my wallet. Vote cast. I also haven't used Netflix once since that day despite being able to. I've been using Amazon and Microsoft video where I own over 500 movies so you can stuff the whole theft argument. I've bought more content than most and that doesn't include my DVD, Blu-ray, and uhd Blu-ray collection which is well over 1400 movies and TV shows at this point. Your right...I've been rooting since the first Android phone but I totally don't understand the possibilities. My argument is simple. The overwhelming majority of root users don't mess with apps. To hell with that nonsense argument anyways. What is the danger to Netflix? Copying movies? Please...it's a million times easier to do it on a PC. Even windows xp can handle it without issue. Does Netflix and you I suppose really think root users are using the app to steal content? If so how? Show me one forum topic, one article, one modified Netflix apk that allows downloading and bypassing their drm. I'm begging you. Just 1. BAlGaInTl I reviewed the Netflix TOS, and I will agree that you are not stealing. I'll even remove the verbiage from my post. Netflix does not make any such stipulation. They speak only of the "Account Owner" and "Devices." I guess I just assumed that, and that's my bad. As I've said in other posts... It isn't all about Netflix. A large part of it is about their content. They really can't argue that point with providers. You either play by their rules, work to establish new rules, or choose not to carry them. Netflix wants to stay relevant on all platforms. That's the main danger to Netflix. In addition, I shouldn't have to give an example in the wild of an exploit. Just because it is difficult to find doesn't mean it doesn't exist. What if someone else writes an app that uses root to mine user account data from Netflix? Should Netflix not be worried about protecting user data? If that happens, who is responsible for the security and the bad press? Probably not Netflix, but they would certainly be impacted. I checked my app really quick (which is stuck on version 4 because I'm affected). Since Netflix keeps you logged in for convenience (that's spelled out in their terms), a quick look gives my full name, username, phone number, zip code, the brand of payment card, and the last 4 digits of that card. That's quite a bit of information that can easily be gathered by a piece of Malware. Now as I said... Netflix probably wouldn't be liable if a user was compromised because of root. It would certainly be a danger to their business however. Why should the be asked to take that risk? It seems to me that they are approaching this in a realistic manner, and rolling it out in a reasonable way. Would this affect the majority of root users? Probably not. By their nature, root users will find ways around it anyway. The problem is that the impact to Netflix from losing content and/or a compromised app is disproportionate the loss of blocking root users. It's simply a numbers game, and you can't blame Netflix for that. And you certainly can't blame Google who is trying to improve security. username_not_valid Thats not for me to decide, or argue, the fact is the content providers have decided that rooting is a risk to their copyrighted content, and as such services like Netflix, Amazon, and other streaming services must comply and lock out rooted devices. Passing safetynet and using Googles DRM framework is the easiest way to claim due diligence, so thats what they will do, and in order to keep Android competitive Google is providing the tools needed to make it possible. What I will argue though is that your notion that custom ROMs etc are more secure is unfounded. The best might well be, but there are hundreds of completely random and unchecked ROMs out there that could contain absolutely anything, you cant possibly claim that custom ROMs are inherently safer or more secure than OEM ROMs, outdated or not. jonzey231 So let's play this out: If someone takes the Netflix .apk and mods it with malware and then signs it, it will pass installation on the device. 1. User opens app. 2. App does whatever shitty thing it's designed to do while the user thinks they just got around the block. 3. The OS scans the app and warns the user it's been modified and they should uninstall it. 4. User thinks "Ha! I know and that's why it works!" 5. User keeps app until they get a call from Credit Karma that their identity was probably stolen but they don't know how. 6. Person spends 6 months fixing stolen identity. But still uses that app the whole time. Ultimately, that user is still going to be screwed. Would you or I make this mistake? No. Would your cousin's friend's dad because he had his son root so he could tether for free and overheard you guys talking about sideloading apps and googled how to do it? Yes. Randroid Problem is, even in your scenario, root has nothing to do with it. Someone who is not rooted could do the same thing. The only problem is, now MORE people who root are going to be *forced* to look for a modified apk because the official apk is not available from the Play Store. So in the end, it's causing more problems than it's fixing. Corbin Baxter Here's the thing about rooting: when you alter your devices software like that, then Google shouldn't be responsible for anything that comes afterwards for the user. This just helps discourage rooting, which can alter a new users perspective on Android, or make someone reconsider getting an Android device. someone755 For what it's worth, back in 2011/2010, many of us bought into Android *because* we could root. Imagine the possibilities of being in control of so much more of your system than with any mobile OS prior; We've spent hundreds (some, thousands) of dollars in this environment, on devices, apps, books etc. I understand this isn't how things stand nowadays, but root is still prevalent because of one issue that Google will not fix (or at least, won't until O+ is running on the majority of devices, but that'll take two years at the minimum), and those are updates and vendor apps (i.e. bloatware). If my phone is stuck on Lollipop I'm going to root it; I'll be able to mitigate the memory leak performance drops, and overall customize the device to fit my specific needs -- I've made quite a few friends (think ROM and kernel devs) because I just wanted to put a thermal engine better than Qualcomm's horrendous MPDecision into the kernel directly (i.e. I took the kernel source and modified it to fit my needs). What Google is trying to do here is, yes, discourage rooting, but instead of fixing the root cause (heh) behind why people root in the first place (that is, again, customizability and personal(ized) performance tuning, in large part to keep devices on older Android versions alive), root wouldn't be necessary. In the long run this *might* fix the symptom, but it most definitely will not help in fixing the cause. And that's because the cause is Google itself. As if apps like Snapchat blocking power users from their apps wasn't enough, now there's this -- If it becomes so common that even Google's own apps start to utilize the feature, I'll be gone to another mobile platform within a month. That might mean iOS, it might mean S60v3, I'll know that if (or rather, when) it happens. tl;dr: Google is putting a band-aid on a shotgun wound. Corbin Baxter I'm speaking mainly for new Android users. They don't feel as comfortable rooting. Doing this makes Android SEEM more like iOS. This doesn't MAKE Android like iOS. New users are comfortable with that. This is the same issue Microsoft had with Windows 8/8.1. Classic users, and Windows enthusiasts, hated someone changing the way they would use their computers. Microsoft introduced a different way of doing things, and to enthusiasts, it was bad, no matter how good it might be. Google's Project Treble should mostly fix the fragmentation problem, therefore giving Android users one less reason to root. To us enthusiasts, nothing can beat rooting, but it might not be the best solution to the problems Android has. Google seems intent on fixing the problems rooting tries to solve, but in a higher-quality and reliable way. No hard feelings😉 trparky They won't understand that, they're too blinded by their geek rose colored glasses. Corbin Baxter I don't expect everyone to understand, but I'll be happy if even a small handful understand what Google is doing here. Dmitri Smirnov > when you alter your devices software like that, then Google shouldn't be responsible for anything that comes afterwards for the user. As if right now Google or the OEMs are in any ways responsible for the malware or unpatched firmware vulnerabilities that stay this way for year. But yes, the users that root are the problem. Corbin Baxter For unrooted phones, yes Google and OEMs are very responsible. But after you root, Android loses most of its security and stability, and rooting is basically tinkering with core system files. Google doesn't have any control over what the user can or can't do after that. bekifft That wasn't even a devil's advocate, that was a straight up strawman. Frosted Butts Yes.. please tell me about all the Netflix alternatives i can install, that can legally stream from Netflix...... Right now, if i am rooted and want Netflix (a service i am paying for), i must go through 3rd party app stores to install the APK. There is no choice at all... R Firestone ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ Umm you have the choice to unroot your device. Maxr1998 ..which is a bad choice for many. d0x360 Yes you do except I rooted my device to make it MORE secure. Unrooting would make my device less secure than sideloading apps would. username_not_valid People can keep saying that, but the content providers have no way to know whether or not you have taken measures to secure your custom device, whereas if they go down this root they know its handled. BAlGaInTl "whereas if they go down this root they know its handled" I see what you did there. 😆😄 ...or just watch Netflix from Chrome! You could even do this from a Linux box with root! 😃 Suicide_Note Sure there is: unroot. Problem solved. neoKushan "I've solved this problem by creating 3 more problems - but it IS solved!" Eric Braun https://www.amazon.com/Netflix-Inc/dp/B005ZXWMUS Option C .. ?? h4rr4r A choice that is now more popular. dcdttu It's not so much about what a user chooses to do. It's about probability. The probability that sites are going to try to lure users into downloading malware-infected Netflix APKs from 3rd party sites is going to go up if you can't download it from a safe source in the first place. This is just like the fact that, if you don't give drug users a safe and clean place to shoot up, they're going to go do it somewhere else that's much more dangerous. Both of these scenarios are bad for society in general, no matter what the original intention was. kgptzac 1/10. Gotta try harder. Premsuraj How? Google Play Protect will still catch malicious apps makapav Yes but you're potentially making people venture through shady sites to get the APKs. Eric Braun Or to Amazons App store or Fdroid. The people going to shady sites are already going there, this isn't going to increase the traffic by any real amount. tehboogieman Are you sure that Google will continue allowing GPP for unlocked or rooted users going forward? Not to mention that it's not a silver bullet for 0days d0x360 It barely works as is. There are tons of apps that slip through every day. Krebs on security reports on them quite frequently. I don't trust Google's scanning of apps at all which is why I root. I can make my phone more secure and I can also image the device as often as I want so if something does happen it's fixed within 5 min. If I unroot then I lose the protection along with the backups. Premsuraj Custom ROMs and root can't protect from 0days either. And just out of curiosity how is root going to provide more security? If anything it makes the device less secure tehboogieman Nobody said root makes a device more secure. Blocking root users from downloading apps from the Play Store puts users at more risk since those users will be more inclined to sideload apps from sources that might not be as reliable as the Play Store. Premsuraj The only people who cares about this are the people who root. And those user's generally tend to be more knowledgeable about what kind of apps and app stores they can trust. ASYOUTHIA✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ And only <2% of users will do this to keep rooted. xxTheGoDxx Only the plus 50 - 100 Million users that have root: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=eu.chainfire.supersu ASYOUTHIA✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ You do realize that that's just downloads right? ...not active users. blindexecutioner I'm not mad. I continue to use things like magisk to help get around stuff like this. All this will do is encourage me to use unauthorized sources for offending apps if magisk ever stops working. There is a reason I use Android over iOS and it certainly isn't because the apps are better designed or whatever. brian. Magisk is a good way around this. However, I don't know how long this will last. I would think with security in mind and developers trying to monetize more, it will put pressure on Google to make SafetyNet get triggered much easier. Obviously, I don't have any way of knowing, but this could easily turn into a cat and mouse game more than it already is. Android Pay was first, other apps did it like Super Mario Run, which who cares, but now Netflix? Changes are coming, and it doesn't look good for the rooting community. D13H4RD2L1V3 I'm not sure if everyone gets why some of us went through the trouble of gaining SU access. Sure, maybe there's a few who went through all that trouble for nefarious purposes (and maybe that got regulatory bodies concerned to the point where Google even needed to consider this) but from my perspective at least, a lot of us gain Superuser access mainly to get features that we liked on other Android flavors, especially in the case of a build of Android that's very close to Google's vision. Such as the ability to hide the navbar at any time we wanted and also to gain theming support (which I feel should be added officially sooner rather than later because I absolutely hate how Google is making their already-bright UI even more eye-searing with even more white-colored elements, which also makes the benefits of OLED much less obvious). I wouldn't be as concerned if these features were pushed to AOSP soon, but as it stands, I feel that Google should probably think about making these features available soon. Marty Thank the bad apples for why you no longer have freedom. Jeremy ディリマ Would changing region firmware with Odin flag the SafetyNet check on Samsung mobiles? Soz if it's a stupid question a lot has changed since I last fiddled with Android Christopher Robert This was a long time coming. Once root user started using root to pirate software, and/or get around geo locks, instead of using it to add feature to their firmware or improve their devices performance, it was only a matter of time before it all got torn down. h4rr4r Get around geo locks? You mean have my device report the location I want it to report? Yeah, how terrible that I control what my computer does. dizel123 You still do. This doesn't affect that at all h4rr4r You said the justification for that was people using their devices for their own reasons in the way they liked. I was pointing out that this is a normal thing and not something that should be punished. Cuvis You don't need root to pirate. You never did. Marty Apple says, Thank you. h4rr4r Sounds like we need a new FREE platform. Maybe Amazon can use this to push their store. mxwp but will the Netflix from the Amazon App Store work on rooted phones? Curt RIP Root. I'm not moving from stock anymore, just cab with the hassle. Until there's a 'reliable' way to hide from Safety Net, I'll enjoy my Android Pay, banking apps and overall smoothness. (If it was up to me, I'd be rooted with Linage) h4rr4r IOS is the platform for you. That was the deal from the beginning. hp-fourtwenty magisk....giyf .y phone is rooted with lineage 14.1, and passes safetynet. problem solved! jcopernicus Fantastic news. Lawstorant All this butthurt for what? You all sound like Magisk doesn't exist. Dave Hamilton Lets take Apple and there closed source. Lets take Google and there open source, the freedom to do and change as you please to make the device yours. No two devices have to be the same. Lets get 115 million android users, and then start deciding you no longer have this choice and freedom to do what you want! When something gets better and better, its only a matter of time before all the things you love are removed and comersilised Eric Braun You still have the option to do what you want. However like everything there are reactions for every action. Want to root or unlock your device? Sure, however there may be a few apps that no longer appear in the playstore. May want to have a backup like Amazon App Store or something similar ready. No one is stopping you, feel free to do as you please. tehboogieman Man, if I have to choose between having a device with root or a device with apps that use day to day, the iPhone goes from a 1% chance of being my daily driver to about 50% There are still a lot that can Android can do that iOS can't, but if I'm living in a walled garden the iPhone is looking pretty attractive. 5+ years of official OS support, solid retail network for quick service or hardware exchanges. The Play Store is my main source of apps that I know are vetted and generally safe. I have no desire to manage app updates manually. There is always a chance that someone will build and maintain an appstore that will have all root blocked apps (maybe the future of APKMirror?). If not it might be the death of Android for users like me Eric Braun Even without all of this I would use an APKMirror App that allowed for updating of apps automatically. dizel123 Google gives app developers more control over their apps. Whiny entitled internet crybabies go on the internet and whine and cry. Aka...Thursday neoKushan Alternatively: Google restricts users from using their device, which they own, how they see fit. dizel123 Except Google isn't restricting anyone from doing anything. But being 100% wrong has never stopped anyone in the internet NubCake being an asshole (in your case) hasn't stopped anyone from commenting eather it seems. dizel123 I can admit to being an asshole. But I'm also right so it's all good. neoKushan It's certainly not stopping you. dizel123 I haven't experienced it so of course it's not stopping me trparky You may own the hardware but you don't own the software, you only have a license to use it. Csöpi Thats so greate. I have a stock oneplus one and for some strange reasons i was failing the test beforhand, but now its all green. Still cant update the netflix app hence chromecast isnt working either anymore. Not really happy. JC If there's a will there's a way. brian. If more developers get on board with this, I can't see why I would switch to Android. I've always been curious about new Android phones, bought a bunch and rooted them all if I could. This is not good for a person like me. d0x360 If Google keeps this up and app devs include the api to block rooted phones then my days using Android will be over and Google will have lost a user who's been there since the g1. I don't know what I'd switch to... probably windows mobile because I'm not a fan of apple whatsoever. It's really a shame because if I had to guess I'd say 99.99% of people who root do so for either the added security and or customized experiences. For example I use root to modify my status bar and quick panel as well as firewall my apps and use adaway and yes Google I do whitelist sites that aren't obnoxious with their ads. John Doe All the more reason for the APK mirror appstore LoL Jan-Lk Else Yeah Google want's us to buy tooooo expensive phones to just get the latest Android, because cheap phones suck at updates and so they need to be flashed and rooted... trparky But if the community raises holy hell with the OEMs then maybe it will be corrected. There's no damn reason why a three year old device can't be updated when an eight year old Windows 7 machine is still receiving Windows Updates. McStagger WHY DOES NETFLIX CARE IF THE PHONE IS ROOTED?!?!?!?! mxwp Netflix does not care, but the content creators that make the stuff you see on Netflix do care. They care because they are idiots who think it is easier to pirate from rooted phones. bekifft Again, Google becomes more and more restrictive. I switched from iPhone because the screens were too small, and Google was far less restrictive. Both of those issues are now resolved, and Google's upped the price of their device to match Apple. May as well switch back to iPhone, Google seems to support it just as much as Android anyway. Luxferro Except it's not just rooted users! Any device with an unlocked bootloader. hp-fourtwenty Your comment sucks for misinforming users about what safetynet is....has NOTHING to do with unlocked bootloaders. Luxferro Sure it does. My Nexus 6P only has an unlocked bootloader, and Netflix disappeared from the play store after the last update. And I'm not the only one, so I suggest you do some reading. TechGuy22 more reason for me to pirate hey, have at it Matías Duarte I hope Netflix does the same with Jailbroken iOS devices. Why they do this btw? To prevent people recording their movies? You can do that with Windows.. Knowledgeborn Allah In all honesty, that'll probably never happen. Jailbreaking iOS opens the doors to a lot of customization on an iPhone, but the security issues are often minimal (with the exception being not having the latest software version). Jailbreaking is pretty much filtered through the Cydia platform. You don't have access to the entire system with a jailbreak. Rooting is completely different, because you can completely reshape the core OS. fbl Note : I don't work for Netflix so I can't comment for them. Possible causes : - the right holders might be pushing for this. I work on roughly the same product area and we don't implement DRM because we like them, we implement them because we contractually have to. -Netflix is tired of getting low notes because of crashes coming by shitty hacks in custom roms. Zach Mauch Anyone know how chromebooks will be affected by this? Will dev mode being enabled cause you to fail SafetyNet Checks? That is currently the only way to install apks on Chromebooks. Branko But Android AOSP!11 -Google 2011 How the times how changed. Wayne Randall ALT arguement, because I don't have time to read every comment... This doesn't limit me and my rooted N6P at all, this move limits how much money they (the devs and Google) are going to make. I can't buy it (the app or coins, or special characters, or bonus content, w/e) if I can't see it. Plain and simple. The important apps will still be there. No app is worth unroot. Block Project Fi from root though... weeeellll. I guess I'd unroot for that. mxwp yeah, only Netflix, banks, and big names will use these blocks. i am guessing most devs want as much exposure as possible. PVL_93_RU Google is actively trying to kill the modding community. Not the Custom ROM makers, but people who root and install Xposed. All because they compromise the security for Android Pay I fear the day root and Xposed apps start disappearing from the Play Store trparky If it comes to security vs being open, security will always win (or at least should always win). Eric Koop I had my Shaw Gateway app update yesterday and they changed it so it doesn't work if rooted. So I had to uninstall and find an APK online of an older version. Now it's just a matter of time before I forget and re-install the update. What a pain... disqus_em5YfkbWdk Well this would certainly get me to cancel Netflix. My personal Plex server is far better than Netflix could ever be anyway. Vivek Rameses Becoming apple more and more every day. Disgusting. Knowledgeborn Allah Android is starting to look more and more like iOS with each update... ¯_(ツ)_/¯ trparky Open platforms rarely stay open once the Benjamins start rolling in. hp-fourtwenty Go ahead and block me...I'll just pirate your app. Play nice and so will I. Start poking me and I'll poke back by never giving you another penny. App devs can't beat XDA devs. It's not going to happen. My unlocked, rooted, rommed and modded device still passes safety net. The day that stops, so does the flow of money leaving my hands on the play store. Luxferro Lay off the sodas.... UniBroW Question, can those of you without access to Netflix on Google play, can it be installed from the Amazon App Store? Stanley C. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/dd381b7e8a39df74c4725712a0db906098c965e9ee4194b6e01e020fd69ee566.png Thats how magisk is made... Magic! Marti Abernathey Yawn. I've got a rooted device and just installed Netflix... because? Magisk. As soon as they made this choice I cancelled. Not because I can't get around it, but because they make me do that. mrjayviper even on a non-rooted LOS mis 5s+, I cannot install Netflix. unlocking the bootloader already tripped safety. And I don't want to root. The features available in non-rooted LOS is enough for me. Teh BuG No. Bueno. TedPhillips Sigh. What's the over-under on this becoming pervasive in the play store... MicroG / Fdroid I'm coming soon. World needs a solid single alternative gcm replacement to catch on. TedPhillips As far as the potential for support overhead, being rooted is generally less than the pain coming from the Xposed/magisk crowd. You need to be actively interfering with an app via root vs code being injected into low levels of the framework that everything uses. TedPhillips I think the best outcome could be that Google opens up their process for little guys to certify there own rom builds, ala let's encrypt lowering friction on getting ssl setup. AOSP should not be a functionally useless base implementation for I'm roms, but something you can use in​ practice. TedPhillips Hey guys, don't worry. Google says Android is for everyone. https://www.android.com/everyone/ That includes AOSP developers too, right? That website seems to tread the line pretty carefully, ala 'no one is forcing you use Google play' but Hiroshi's quote seems like it comes with a grain of salt since he owns Play. I'd love to see AP interview him about this. qkjDlav As an app developer for a large app used globally, the two biggest time wasters in a developer's life are a) debugging device specific issues (HTC, Samsung, etc) and b) crash logs with Xposed in the stack trace. Developers are tired of having to sit around with device farms at their desks just to make sure new features and changes work with each quirky variant of Android that manufacturers want to deploy, and custom roms do make it worse. Enthusiasts are welcome to customize their own versions of Android and sideload apps, but we don't want to see crashlogs in the Developer Console from rooted/custom ROM users. And companies probably don't want to keep paying us to debug issues that only a small minority of users will see. Lê Nguyên Chương Most stupid thing I've ever heard in my life.

Netflix was just the start: Google Play Console lets developers exclude app availability for devices that don't pass SafetyNet Rita El Khoury Follow View All Posts 2017/05/18 3:57am PDTMay 18, 2017 93 Plus 1 on G+ 108 Share on Facebook 82 Share on Twitter Total Shares283 Google News Last weekend, a huge turmoil swept the root-enthusiast Android community as it was discovered then confirmed that the Netflix app was being blocked from showing up in search results on the Play Store for rooted devices. At the time, Netflix said it was using Widevine to block unsupported devices, but that made no sense to us: the app was still functional if it was sideloaded, it was only not showing up as compatible in the Play Store. So what sorcery was Netflix really using?! Turns out it's a new function of the Google Play Console. As part of the updates announced for the Play Console at I/O 2017, Google mentions a new Device Catalog section under Release management that lets developers choose with intricate granularity which devices their app supports on the Play Store. Devices can be viewed and excluded by many attributes including RAM and SoC, but the important factor we're interested in is SafetyNet Attestation. New "Device catalog" lets devs manage the exclusions. Developers will be able to choose from 3 states shown in the top image: not excluding devices based on SafetyNet, excluding those that don't pass integrity, or excluding the latter plus those that aren't certified by Google. That means any dev could potentially block their apps from showing and being directly installable in the Play Store on devices that are rooted and/or running a custom ROM, as well as on emulators and uncertified devices (think Meizu and its not-so-legal way of getting Play Services and the Play Store on its phones). This is exactly what many of you were afraid would happen after the Play Store app started surfacing a Device certification status. This is different from the full SafetyNet API implementation that apps like Android Pay and Pokémon Go use. In the case of Pay/Go, the attestation check happens when the app is installed on your phone and doesn't allow it to run unless it passes the integrity test. But in the case of the Play Console, the attestation check happens when you're browsing the Play Store and only affects the availability of the app for your device. If the full SafetyNet API isn't included in the app itself, you will still be able to grab the APK from other sources, install it, and the app will work just fine. Still, this spells trouble for rooted users and the Android enthusiast community as a whole. Google keeps erecting more and more obstacles each day in the face of root and custom ROMs and even if this won't stop root users who should be knowledgable enough to know how/where to grab an APK and install it, it will make things more and more difficult and maybe less and less worth the trouble. But y'all are rebels and you'll keep on finding a way around it, won't you?

Nice move Google. Suicide_Note Not sure if serious, but either way, this was just a matter of time. YouNex Obviously not serious EowynCarter So, question : Is there anyway to get android O in the future on my nexus 6 and not having problems with this ? IF manufacturer where taking care of updating their devices, wouldn't be an issue... saf1927 If Magisk keeps working, yep. You can. Even my old Nexus 5 is on 7.1.2 and it passes SafetyNet. EowynCarter I want "just work" stuff. Not workaround. Maybe Magisk does the job for some, but not an acceptable solution from my point of view. Mainly the "we don't know if it will keep on working" part. saf1927 Well, it's the best solution so far and it has improved a lot since its inception. I never bothered since the Nexus 5 was a secondary device for me, but now that some apps won't show up anymore on the Play Store, I simply flashed Magisk and that's about it. I haven't tweaked anything. Plus, if you are already flashing a custom ROM, flashing an extra zip file isn't that much work anyway. EowynCarter True, but it's the phone I use dailly. I don't want apps sudendly not working, becasue google decided to push an update that broke magisk. mxwp well if you want things to "just work" then i guess get an iPhone EowynCarter Sadly, I'm beginning to think about that. But that would cause others frustrations. ED-Zが現れた! Well, people will just flock to root-supported apps... Milton P. I actually forgot when was the last time I Rooted a device. No biggie. Suicide_Note The bad thing is it isn't just root that causes problems. Simply unlocking the bootloader will produce the same result. Maxr1998 Just because it's no biggie for you, it doesn't mean everyone approves this. I am actually pretty concerned, because this limits the freedom over our devices even more.. Milton P. Define freedom, please. Maxr1998 Software freedom, to be more specific. You should have the freedom to use and modify your device and it's software however you'd like, and have fill control over it. That means, root access. And since the AOSP core IS free software, the 4 freedoms defined by Richard Stallman apply to it. What this change now introduces is that you're forced to decide between either giving up the freedom over your device or not using the app you wanted to download (which will probably have to be my choice, and that sucks). Milton P. But you're not giving up anything, you just have to make a choice. If you put that way, Google has the freedom of doing with the AOSP core whatever they want, the same way you can modify said core and do as you please, the difference is Google has more money and more responsibilities when it comes to their user base. XDA and other sites will still have a bunch of developers making whatever they please (within the AOSP terms) with the AOSP core. This will just change thinks for the people that use those ROMs bit realistically the vast majority of users won't feel the changes. Sad but true. h4rr4r That choice is giving up freedom you had before. The vast majority will see the rate of Android improvements slow as the Devs on XDA and the like lose interest. Android only exists because of Linux, now it is turning its back on that whole culture. Milton P. Well, I don't see your freedom compromised to be honest with you, but we're seeing things from different angles so that's that. Sorry for your loss in that case. h4rr4r You do not think losing control of your device is a loss of freedom? Milton P. Nope, is just a device, I have more important stuff going on, m device is a tool the same way a hammer is a tool, you can buy a hammer and use it as it is. Sometimes my device is a toy, if I buy a remote control car I'll modify it as long as it is possible, the same way I modify my phone. I have control over my phone. I can install whatever I want at my own risk. If I decide to root my phone I expect things to be broken. I remember when I had an HTC and I hated sense so I decided to install a custom ROM, I gave up the camera and I was aware of it. There was always some compromises with custom ROMs, nothing is changing. I rather have a safe device then a compromised one today, still my choice thou. h4rr4r So you want IOS. Got it. Over here I want freedom. I don't think homedepot should be allowed to tell me what I can hit with the hammer I bought. trparky Open platforms rarely stay open once they become popular. Once the Benjamins come rolling in it tends to override open. h4rr4r Tell that to Linus Torvalds. I am sure he will have many many fuck yous for you. trparky Linux is the rare situation. h4rr4r The rare situation like many others that created android and even google. trparky Yeah but look at Android, the walls are closing around it and there's nothing you can do about it. Face it man, the geeks may have built the system but the common man now rules it. Geeks love choice, yes, they do love their choice but your average person doesn't give a rat's ass about choice. All they want is a device that does what they need it to do when they want to do it. They have no inclination to learn how it works or why it works just as long as it does. This is what geeks do not and refuse to understand. h4rr4r Sure there is, stop using it. Then the common folks will have to follow us to the next platform. trparky As long as their is money involved in maintaining Android it doesn't matter if something better comes along, people will continue supporting Android because it makes them money. Money makes the world go round, get used to it. Maxr1998 ^ What @h4rr4r:disqus says. trparky Yep. The root and ROM community is such a small portion of the Android ecosystem that they really don't matter to them. People have been screaming at Google for years to get the Android house fixed up, this is them doing just that. You can't blame them for doing what the people have asked for. mxwp I agree with you, but sadly you only have freedom over hardware. You can do what you want with the device you buy. But with software you never actually buy it... you only buy a license to use it. Thus you have no real freedom with software. Maxr1998 Android is free software, Apache 2.0 license. At least the AOSP part of it. trparky But the Google parts of it are not covered under the Apache 2.0 license. That's essentially why ROM developers can't package the Google Play Services pack with the ROM itself and instead requires you to download a separate ZIP package from Google to install it separate from the ROM package. Android itself may be free and open but the Google Play Services part is not. Sudev There are far more than few arguments against root access but here are some: Root access is meant for experimental & development purpose and not for Daily Driver for any average user of the platform. Google Play Services & Apps available on Play Store are not "Free Software". Google as provider of Play Services infrastructure has much more liabilities then one can simply assume. And also the app developers have responsibility to protect end users' data. If device has root access available and any rouge app / maleware steals other apps data which is possible, who will be at stack? h4rr4r The ability to do anything I want with my things that I own. Milton P. You​ can do whatever you want with your device, nobody is stopping you. You might see that some apps are not showing up in the play store but you can still side load them, I still see freedom in your future. h4rr4r For how much longer? Soon these apps will ask play services if they are supposed to be installed on that device, at that point you can say goodbye to sideloading. If this is what people want then IOS was the platform for them. thecoolkid Ok Google, define freedom... 😁 Nick I would imagine a great deal of people on this site will be upset, but in actuality I don't think this will affect the user base of many apps that badly h4rr4r Not in the short term. However in the long term it will. Android only exists because of the FREE software movement. Nick Yes, but that doesn't apply to applications, which this is about. h4rr4r Think long term. Same thing applies. trparky No it won't because the root and ROM community is so small it doesn't matter to Google anymore. The 95% of people who simply want a device that works don't care and likely won't ever care. As long as they can play NetFlix, Pokemon Go, or whatever is the next craze they don't care. h4rr4r Again, that is short term thinking. Think past the end of your nose. Android exists because of linux. Google needs this small group to create the very stuff they rely on. trparky You overestimate the value that the community has now. Android may have needed the community back in the beginning to gain the foothold that it has in the market but not so anymore. Android has near 100% market penetration, they have achieved world domination. They don't need the community anymore, they have achieved their goals. h4rr4r Until they are unseated. IBM once had a monopoly on computing devices. They did not need the community to gain a foothold, they would not have a product to gain a foothold without the community. Android only exists because of a collection of those projects. trparky No, Android exists because Samsung, HTC, and LG make devices people want and it makes them money by the semi-truck full. The community doesn't mean shit now, all that matters to these companies is one thing... money, money, and more money. Oh, and did I mention money? This is capitalism man, money rules the world. If you don't make money you are dead. h4rr4r Please tell me how that would have happened without linux. Money loses to good engineering every day. Look at how linux killed solaris. trparky Tell me why Windows is the defacto monopoly on the desktop despite the fact that Linux is better in every damn way possible under the hood? That's right... money. h4rr4r Because the desktop is dead. The fight is over. They lost. Even money can't keep them relevant. trparky Oh, you're funny. The desktop is not dead, it will never be dead. When people need to do real work, they sit down at a desktop. When people want to play real games, they sit down at a desktop. When people need to type out anything longer than a page like a college term paper, they sit down at a desktop. The desktop is king and will always be king. Long live the desktop! h4rr4r The Desktop is a dead man walking. When they do real work, they use a Citrix session. When they game they use a console, or they are already nerds. When people type they can use a fucking chromebook. The desktop as you think of it died already. trparky Try and say that shit over at TechPowerUp, HardOCP, Overclock.net, TomsHardware, etc. and trust me when I say this... you'll be run out of town by people with pitchforks and torches. h4rr4r Those are all nerds. Those are the folks who have desktops running 3 different OSes. They are the folks who are pissed about android being locked down. trparky And your point being? You just admitted that only the "nerds" care about Android being open. Sure, those same "nerds" will go off and create a new platform but the rest of the people who are living in the real world and who don't care one damn bit about how it works will continue to use Android. h4rr4r Those people will eventually move to the new platform. Just like they did with Android. trparky And the same thing will happen to that platform in the future that's happening to Android now. Open platforms are nice and all, I'll admit that, but your average person doesn't care one bit. I dare you to go up to any person on the street and ask them anything about Android. What phone do they have? What model? Most will say "I don't know, something that my carrier gave me for cheap." h4rr4r The wheel of computing we call it. It has happened and will happen again. So what? trparky Which reinforces the idea that I said before, eventually all open systems will become closed (or less open) at some point in their life cycle. It usually happens when it becomes popular with the common man. Why? Because like I've been trying to get through your thick skull, the average person doesn't care how any of this stuff works so long as it works. h4rr4r The average person does not matter. Few open systems become closed. AOSP is still fine. trparky What the hell do you mean by "they don't matter"? They're the ones buying the devices, buying the apps, looking at the ads, etc. Just how the fuck does that translate to "they don't matter"? h4rr4r Because they don't. They don't create, they don't cause new things to be created. They are just users, just like I don't matter to how movies are created. trparky But without money from the people who are consuming said things developers won't make new stuff. Developers do have to eat you know and put a roof over their heads. h4rr4r The giant world of FOSS pretty much proves you wrong. Demand cannot create supply. I don't pirate anything kiddo. I have way too much to lose for that. One of those lawsuits I would actually have to pay, since I could. trparky I'll give a hint on how FOSS works a lot of the time. Some of the top tier Linux kernel developers actually work for companies and they just contribute code in their free time. They may work for Intel, AMD, nVidia, or God knows what but only after their day job is done. Why? Because they need money and they need to eat. This is a basic requirement for people in this world. They need money!!! People don't just write code for the love of it, even Linus Torvalds who's in charge of the Linux kernel itself works for the Linux Foundation and yes, he gets paid for his work to the tune of $10 Million a year. Sorry to burst your bubble man but FOSS projects aren't all happy, happy, joy, joy here... people need to be paid real money to be able to eat, drive a car, put a roof over their heads, etc. On second thought, I'm not sorry I burst your bubble! You need it burst! PEOPLE NEED TO BE PAID REAL FUCKING MONEY!!!! h4rr4r No, they get paid to contribute. During the work day. Not as a hobby. Lots of projects are like that. I won't say exactly how I know about that ;) Their employers just aren't as short sighted as you. Linus did not however create linux to get rich. Great code like great art gets created because it must be. People do what they love. Kid, you will get it one day. When you have enough that you aren't worried about it each day, money stops being that big of a deal. Don't worry everybody goes through a phase like you are now. trparky Dude, we are not the Federation of Planets here living in a happy, happy, joy, joy world in which people can just do whatever they want to do without a care in the world. As long as human greed exists there will always be a need for money. And believe you me, greed will never go away unless we breed a new kind of human and I don't see that happening any time soon. Gene Roddenberry's future will never happen, it just won't. Contrary to a lot of geek dreams it just won't. h4rr4r No idea where you got that idea. Never suggested it. My point was the personal relative value of increasing income drops as income goes up. If you make minimum wage doubling your income is a huge deal. Adding the same amount to my income would not get me to take a job I like less. Offering it to Linus would be a waste of time. Yes, some people will keep chasing dollars, they are the exception not the rule. The employers are working on enlightened self interest. Either they use the FOSS product, gain market advantage with direct knowledge, use it for marketing or believe they are getting something else. PostgreSQL for example has a lot of paid contributors who work for companies that either provide customization, consulting or depend on the project. Others just because it increases quality. Commercial software by and large is not high quality. I have seen a lot of it and 90% if you tried to submit it to a FOSS project of any size would get you denied and possibly mocked. This system continues to be more innovative because it is easy to continue to expand. Anyone with a good idea can fork if their idea is not accepted. trparky > My point was the personal relative value of increasing income drops as income goes up. Tell that to the people in Washington or any CEO that demands ever increasing yearly salaries and end of year bonuses all while raping the companies that they work for. Tell that to the psychopaths on Wall Street. For as long as their is money, people will want more of it. Anyone who says that they don't is flat out lying. h4rr4r Those are the exception not the rule. That is why you call them psychopaths. Honestly, correcting for inflation I really don't care that much if I ever make more. Would it be nice sure, would I give up anything I like about my job? No. If you could double my income but it prevented me from contributing to FOSS projects or owning code I generate off the clock, I would not take that deal. If money was enough to make people do anything MS would have offered Linus $11 million a year to not write it. Heck, Sun would have done it while they were still around. trparky Either you're a child that doesn't know how the adult world works or you're a fucking troll. h4rr4r So you have no idea who makes stuff, neat. I guess you think Henry Ford should have made a faster horse. trparky Oh, I know who makes the stuff I use but I also make sure that they are paid! I give money to those developers who write the programs that I enjoy and if I can't pay them I won't use their programs. I only use a program if I can pay for it. I have put money into their tip jars on their web site, I look for PayPal links and I donate even if it's something small like $5. They deserve it! h4rr4r Good for you! There is a lot of great software that does not make money that way. Some even just ask is that you follow the license, like linux which mediatek steals by not releasing kernel source. So I hope you avoid buying that kind of thing. trparky MediaTek controller chips are known to suck so I don't buy them out of that reason alone. h4rr4r Now I have given you another good reason to avoid them. Bunch of thieves. Rita El Khoury I don't even remember when I last bootloader unlocked. But I know this move toward closing the ecosystem further and further will have ripples in the future. The enthusiast community flocked toward Android for its openness and we have custom ROMs and their enterprising devs to thank for HUNDREDS of new features that they implemented first and everyone clamored for and applauded until they became features in AOSP. If Google thinks it can steer this ship alone and it knows best what to do next, we may have less and less interesting features in the future and more and more of what only one entity thinks is best, not a diverse set of opinions. Nick Given that this only gives the developer the option of requiring these checks, it makes me believe that Google had to do this for some companies that have regulatory or other kinds of requirements. Which is a shame for the rooted (and unlocked?) community, but understandable. Shame Google is most likely going to take the blame here in this comment section though. Rita El Khoury Well, maybe they had to, but that won't stop any developer from implementing it without any regulatory or legal requirement pushing them to do so. Nick Right, which puts this choice on the developer, not Google. Google was stuck behind a rock and hard place, perhaps. EowynCarter Well, google is certainly to blame for not planing to update my nexus 6 to android O. And now I can't even use custom rom as plan B without losing some apps :( Suicide_Note Boo hoo. Buy a new phone and quit crying that Google doesn't support phones forever. EowynCarter Fine can you order a pixel XL and ship it to me in France ? Plus, my nexus 6 still works, I hate having to replace working stuff. Makes no sense, economically and ecologically speaking. Suicide_Note I'll sell you my XL when I'm done with it, but only after i get the Pixel XL 2. :) EowynCarter Well, I do hope Google sells the "pixel 2 "( or whatever its name) here. For now, I'm'just hoping my nexus 6 don't break. Else I might jump on the iOS ship. I'm not convinced the the other android alternatives. Note 8 would be the closest, but touchwiiz, delayed updates.... I'm spoiled after a few years with a nexus. Suicide_Note There always eBay or Swappa if you want to get a first gen Pixel. I was looking at prices over the weekend, and mint condition Pixels are going for about $450. EowynCarter Not so much in France. And eBay for suff that cost more that a few bucks, too risky. Plus, the pixel is getting "old" by now. Wilton Daniel Pinto Troll found trparky Yet Microsoft still supports Windows 7 EIGHT YEARS LATER! How come Microsoft can do that yet Google can't? Alex Louderback Actually, that's Qualcomm EowynCarter Source for this ? trparky And Qualcomm can go fuck themselves. Gee... I wonder why they're being hit with an anti-trust lawsuit. Could this be one of many reasons why? trparky Yes, Google is to blame for that. There's no damn reason why your Nexus 6 can't run Android O other than the fact that they just don't want to. Bojan Bunić My bootloader was unlocked prior to changing the mobo on my 5X, courtesy of Booty Loops. Root, well, probably before I got my Nexus 4. Although I'll see how it'll go on in the future, as we don't have Pixels here, so the only near stock possibility is either OnePlus, or some other device and a custom ROM. Milton P. Agree 100% with you, I mean I remember the old days when I hated HTC's Sense, I literally decided that a phone without a camera was better than whatever HTC did back then, but Android has evolved quite a lot nowadays, don't get me wrong, I do believe that custom ROMs did a great job showing Google what the users want but that won't change, as long as someone shows Google what people want Google will keep improving Android, because there's no limits. Now if they go the Apple way and lock EVERYTHING then we'll be fucked, I'm the meantime developers will find a way around the system pushing Google along. Premsuraj An open bootloader and root actually solves a lot of problems still existing in AOSP. The Nougat update absolutely destoryed the battery life of many Nexus 6P devices, with Google only focussing on the Pixels, there was no fix in it. I unlocked, used Franco Kernel + naptime + Greenify and I now I get adequate battery life. Another feature I can think of is theming. Material design is good, but the whiteness is rage inducing Maxr1998 Well, fuck them. Let's just hope not many devs will use this, and Google won't enable this by default anytime soon. Maxr1998 The more I think about this, the more concerned I get. This will reduce the freedom over our devices, and also limit developers in the awesome things they could do before because of Android's openness. I am all in for device security and fighting against malware, trojans and phishing applications, don't understand me wrong, but that doesn't mean that you have to take people away their freedom - just look at how Linux (GNU and Linux) is doing it. Tom Westrick How does this limit developers? If anything it gives them more control. Maxr1998 Fair point, I should have been more specific. With "developers", I meant rom developers and modders, app developers only if they require root access for their apps. "Normal" developers can use this to enforce a "secure" (read: DRM locked-down) environment, but that's not really a good thing in my opinion.. (Refer to my other comments.) trparky You're angry at the wrong people, you should be angry at Hollywood; they're the ones that are demanding this kind of stuff. Their content, their rules; it's how things are in the real world. They have to do what they need to do to protect their investments, plain and simple. We don't necessarily have to like it, hell... we may even hate it, but that's how it is. You want the content? Play by their rules. Colin Richardson If you are an app developer and want your app to run on custom roms..... don't turn on "Requires SafetyNet"... bekifft We are increasingly living in the future Richard Stallman warned us about. With Google taking all these steps, may as well go back to using jailbroken iPhones. Bart Janusz I've already enabled it and I know at least 3 others devs that did it as well. I really don't care about root per se, but custom roms and xposed is source of countless problem as both are buggy as hell. Maxr1998 But in which way does that influence you? Xposed can introduce bugs to the system, sure, but it won't affect the performance of your app unless it itself is modded, so you probably don't have to fear bad reviews for bad performance anyway. And custom roms? LineageOS on my mother's Moto G runs like a champ and much better than the 5.1 stock rom before. And in my experience as a dev, there were much more incompatibilities with Samsung TouchWiz than with AOSP-based custom roms. refthemc I'm sure he's just trying to avoid the headache of emails he gets daily from users who have no idea that it's their fault the app is not working or crashing... Bart Janusz Indeed, not to mention extra crash and ANRs reports which seems to influence app positioning. Maxr1998 But why? The device may behave more buggy at some parts because of Xposed (and mine definitely ran like shit on MM because of some mods, but I NEVER blamed any apps), but the apps itself won't run worse if not modded - normally they should even run better if you only use performance mods like Greenify, NLP Collector wakelock disabler and other light mods. I don't think he gets many reports anyway, considering what @marcusmarcus2:disqus said. Bart Janusz You may not, but many users do, and as I said there are a lot of bogus ANRs and crash reports. Since my app depends heavily on low level OS elements both custom ROMs and xposed are deal breakers (and you really should check source, since I do not update my website as I moved to G+/FB but app has sizable user base given its niche and I'd to deal with ROM/xposed issues fequently). Maxr1998 Well, but the same type of users also give bad reviews etc. without using any mod or root. You generalize modders to only cause problems, and therefore lock out everyone. About your app/website thing: fair point, I didn't look at it yet, and have to apologize for being a little rude. marcusmarcus2 You need to take your own advice, "you really should check source". If you moved to G+/FB, then why does your app on the play store still point to the same website as well. Or at least put a link on the old website that directs to G+/FB. There is nothing that points to your so called G+/FB source. So @Maxr1998:disqus has no other source to check at the moment. Bart Janusz Not that I care but if you try to draw conclusion about app you should probably visit Play Store listing. Anyhow that's really not important I just chimed in to explain why developer will use this. I've choose to do so due to extra burden which in effect hurts majority of my user base, one of my colleagues cited lucky patcher and freedom (which I think is not such a good idea but its his choice). trparky You may not blame the apps because you know better but most people don't understand that, most people see a crashing app and suddenly you see, as the developer, a ton of comments saying that your app sucks. h4rr4r Please do tell us about your apps so we can be sure to avoid them on any devices we have not yet rooted. marcusmarcus2 His disqus profile leads to this website http://artflowstudio.com/ which has a few apps listed. Art oriented apps. There is only 1 update on that website since 2014, so I don't think I would be to concerned about installing one of his apps. Jordan Palmer Nice detective work. Adrian I can see a lot of refund requests coming from people who paid for apps and suddenly are told "Nope. Not for you anymore." A lot of us are rooted and buy apps and you'd better believe noise will be made if an app I use daily, that I paid for, suddenly breaks with an update because it's no longer blessed by the dev to run on my device. It's your app and you can do what you want with it, but there is always another side to the coin. BAlGaInTl That's not the way that Netflix worked it, and I doubt other developers of paid apps would either. I have a OnePlus One, that I run Lineage OS on since the original Cyanogen OS is now defunct and does not receive any updates. Netflix simply doesn't update to v 5+. It still works just fine. I may not get the newest and latest features, but part of that is on me for using a device that is dated. I'm not one of those users who, because I paid for an app once, fells that I should get all of the updates from now until the end of time. That isn't sustainable for developers. It could very well be that Netflix has some new features/offerings in the works in which they are getting pressure from outside sources to push this. A lot of valid reasons for a developer to enable the check exist. As long as they do it in the same manner that Netflix has, I don't see the issue. Adrian And just like Pokemon Go, eventually you'll get a message that you need to upgrade to the latest version or the app won't work, you know, that new version that won't let you actually log into it anymore. We've already seen this happen so let's not pretend that it isn't the next logical step. They aren't going to keep letting people sign in indefinitely with an app that doesn't have the security level they want. It's naive to think that hey I can just stick with the last version that works for root. It takes all of what, the time it takes to create a switch that says minimum version required to log in is "DRM version" BAlGaInTl Good Point. I recognize that. But it seems that the blame (in general) is being directed at Google in many of these posts. If that scenario happens, it isn't Google that blocked you from accessing Netflix. The need for this level of security is on the increase. The same users demanding better security and longer updates are the first ones to cry foul when Google starts laying the groundwork for exactly what they have asked for. Adrian I think there is a way to do both that doesn't piss off a very active community that helped take Android from a very very very ugly, second class OS to what we have now. I know a lot of us remember just how crippled Android was and it was the root/mod community that produced the bulk of what is now standard on Android. There needs to be a way to secure the devices AND not turn their back on the developer community that contributes. The idea, in Netflix's case, that root = pirate is insane. Why in the world would someone prefer to rip content on their phone to say a computer or XBox that is never going to move and can do it while you get on with your life? They're doing something for the sake of saying they're doing something, but if they think it's going to make a dent in piracy they, and the studios are nuts. I watch a lot of Netflix and still prefer to buy discs. People who do things the right way and are perfectly happy paying for content shouldn't have to jump through hoops to watch it. Those of us who root usually have a handful of things that stock Android is not doing for us. It's why we root. If all of these things were available in stock, my reasons for rooting would disappear but I don't see that happening any time soon. I think Android is getting so much better but if they make it exactly like iOS, might as well go to the dark side because Apple's apps tend to be more polished, come out first and OS updates are frequent. Don't bite the hand that feeds you just because you're getting more popular. BAlGaInTl I think that Netflix is a good example. It is HIGHLY likely that the reason for recent unpopular changes (see also VPN blocking) are being driven by other entities. It isn't that Netflix thinks its a problem, but the people that control a large portion of their content do. root pirate but it does introduce a security risk. I don't see how Google is turning their backs on developers. Developers are free to develop as they see fit and choose (at least for the moment) whether or not they will implement the SafetyNet check. The inherent problem is that a circumvented security is still circumvented and can no longer be considered secure. I can clearly see why some apps would and should frown upon that. Maybe not Netflix and Mario (IMHO), but certainly something like bank and payment apps. I don't think the inherent open nature of android will ever reduce to the level of iOS. But some changes have to occur to meet the needs/desire of the majority. Security is inherently difficult. The easier and more flexible you try to make it, the less secure it becomes. Adrian I do think banking apps should run in a secure space. Completely agree with that, but I disagree with root = less secure. My nexus devices stopped getting OS and security updates. Nothing. VERY insecure and dangerous. I rooted them, updated the OS with images from XDA developers and my devices that were once easy targets are more secure. There is always two sides to it. I see that Google is finally trying to take security seriously on Android and doing things in layers that completely cut out the vendor AND the carriers is the right step. Right now, Root is the only way to update a perfectly good device like my Nexus tablet tablet that the vendor said "oh well" to. Until Google has a REAL strategy in place to keep ALL Android devices secure, root will be necessary. Not everyone wants to or can upgrade devices every two years because they get abandoned. My father doesn't need an S8. He does need a device that gets security updates for more than a year after purchasing his phone. BAlGaInTl You are exactly correct, and I'm in the same situation with my OnePlus One. But in working to increase your security level, you leave holes behind. The key words that you used are "more secure." I agree. You are "more secure." But still (probably) less secure than a device that has been thoroughly tested, certified, and passes SafetyNet without hacks. Google has been open that they are working on security updates. They have improved significantly over the last couple years in getting those out. I feel that they are putting in place a real strategy to keep Android devices secure. This is part of that groundwork. I also feel that they are actively looking to replace Android in it's current state, and I can't say I blame them. The only real strategy may be to take lessons learned and start over. Lucky for them, they have the resources to do so. trparky > take lessons learned and start over Pretty much. The worst thing that they did from the very beginning was to allow for the OEMs to do what they wished. Google essentially made a deal with the devil when they released Android to the world. They wrote no requirements into the Android agreements that the OEMs agreed to to require updates to be a necessary thing. Big mistake Google. BAlGaInTl The really needed to in order to get their foot in the door of the market. If it would not have been open source from the beginning, none of the major manufactures would have bought off on it. The fact that they could use it for free (essentially) and still be able to customize on top of it is what sold it. trparky And now look at it, Android is a fucking mess of non-updated insecure devices that are ripe for anyone to be able to take over and turn into a botnet. trparky And you should be raising holy hell with the OEM that made that device! Just because your device is old doesn't mean that it shouldn't still be supported. Windows 7 is nearly eight years old and it still receives Windows Updates. Why can't your device? BAlGaInTl Normally, I would agree, but the OnePlus One is a special case. The OEM operating system is the now defunct Cyanogen OS. I had to balance having the original OS without updates, or running another with updates. The phone is now almost three years old. If I bought a PC with Windows on it three years ago, and Microsoft had since gone out of business, should the PC manufacturer be responsible for providing Windows 7 updates? Even though the PC is beyond it's support date? Sure, I can increase the security by switching to another OS that is updated. It may even be a Windows clone. But if a software developer decided to only support "original, unmodified" PC configurations, that would be within their right. trparky But it can be adapted to run LineageOS. Sudev There is bit difference in analogy here: OnePlus manufactured the phone and Cynogen Inc customized AOSP Android OS for it, they didn't developed it from ground up. I understand that Cynogen INC is out of business now too. However in PC world, it would be the case that you purchased a PC from Dell and get Microsoft Windows OS with some additional Dell software. If Dell or developer of that custom software goes out of business you still get OS update for your PC. Its not android OS itself out business here. Adrian and for the record, I absolutely agree that it was the content providers and not all on Netflix. trparky You should be demanding that OnePlus send an official update to your device. So what if your device is old? It should be still supported. Windows 7 is still supported nearly eight years later, why can't your device be supported for that long as well? Plumplam Who cares except for a bunch of XDA nerds? If it means better security then I'm all for it. Dmitri Smirnov Well, for starters, it doesn't mean better security, since it does nothing to address the problems with vulnerable outdated android versions that will be "certified", but will allow malicious apps to quietly escalate their privileges and do their dirty work, but will block "uncertified" custom roms that actually have all the recent secuirity patches and give user full control over who has root access and how. Also, "bunch of XDA nerds" are the source of a lot of features that had their trial run in custom ROMs and then were adopted to the AOSP. Should I remind you of "The Oak and the Pig" fable? Alienate the developers bringing new ideas to the ecosystem - lose the competetive edge you had over other OSes saf1927 Actually, custom ROMs never really have the latest security patches despite what they claim since kernels aren't maintained and no proprietary blobs is updated anymore. If ROM developers were OEMs, they'd be violating their agreements with Google by bumping the patch level without actually addressing all the vulnerabilities. Dmitri Smirnov Well they patch the AOSP to the same level as latest official one and kernel - if it's possible to do so without breaking the compatibility with compiled blobs or at least on the level of latest official firmware. So in the end run it's at least as secure as the official firmware, often - much more so. saf1927 If you look at the security bulletin, most vulnerabilities come from proprietary drivers and require these to be updated. On a supported device, these are provided by the chip manufacturers to the OEMs, on an unsupported device they aren't updated anymore. A custom ROM can only fix userspace security issues. In the end, bumping the patch level without addressing all vulnerabilities in that patch gives a false sense of security to users. Dmitri Smirnov If anything, this is an argument for forcing OEMs to opensource their blobs. For some reason community is much better at releasing the fixes for what they can change (userspace), while OEMs generally stop caring as soon as device is out the door. saf1927 The problem goes beyond OEMs unfortunately. All the phones you can buy are assembled with off-the-shelf components that they buy from other manufacturers and it is them that provide the binary blobs to the OEMs. If they stop supporting components, the OEMs can't do anything. For the chip, it's companies like Qualcomm, Samsung, Mediatek etc. that need to support it with up-to-date drivers. Once they stop, the life-cycle of a phone comes to an end. trparky And that is probably one of many reason why Qualcomm is facing a nice fat anti-trust lawsuit. Serves them right. trparky That ain't ever going to happen. There's no way they're going to allow for their intellectual property to be open for all the world to see and have it cracked open. It would be corporate suicide since their competitors would be able to reverse engineer their stuff. Suicide_Note Never heard of "The Oak and the Pig" before. Could you tell me more? Seriously. Dmitri Smirnov http://www.aliceswonderland.eu/Alice-ska350-en.html Maxr1998 Ah, Lessing. Going to read the original version in a minute :) username_not_valid Thats a very generous view of the custom ROM community. It might be true of a few, very few devs, but most ROMs are unsupported garbage with serious security issues. Dmitri Smirnov Maybe so, but out of this cesspool of garbage CyanogenMod was born, which became LineageOS. I'd say their quality standard appeals me more than a lot of OEMs. username_not_valid Cyanogen and Lineage was what i had in mind.. Each to his own i guess. BAlGaInTl Yes and no. I run Lineage on my OnePlus One because Cyanogen OS is no longer supported. I can say with certainty that Lineage introduces stability issues that I have to deal with to be up to date. Wilton Daniel Pinto Ninna pooty bewarci Qwip Consider the bigger picture. Right now, users are being shuffled into a situation where they must restrict the control they have over their device if they want to be able to use Netflix (and presumably banking apps will follow soon). That may seem fine, and from some security perspective it is probably a good thing. How much control do you have over your _laptop_? How much do you want? Right now, we're blissfully able to install unsigned software on our computers (although various OSs will complain about it), but will that last? How long will it be before we can only open our banking interface on our laptop using a trusted, digitally signed browser on a machine that is using secure boot and can only run signed binaries? I can understand the direction that Netflix (and others) are coming from, and to them it may even make sense. The question is: what is the cost of ceding control over our devices/machines in order to be able to watch netflix, etc. trparky Yeah and that's why Windows is the virus filled cesspool that it is today. Windows 10 is slowly changing Windows to be an app store based ecosystem in which all apps will be sandboxed. It's coming to the desktop near you. saf1927 I hope Magisk (or other similar mods in the future) keep working, so to prevent this. Not a problem on my Pixel XL since I haven't rooted it, but on my Nexus 5 Magisk allows it to pass Safety Net even though it's running a custom ROM (7.1.2) and it's rooted. Hendrik Leppkes SafetyNets primary purpose is to secure devices for Android Pay, and when you deal with actual money transactions on your device, you really don't want any hack interfering with it - so I'm quite certain they'll do whatever they can to break hacks like this and ensure the security and integrity of the device. h4rr4r No, its primary purpose is to make the device trustworthy for others not the person who paid for it. This is how it makes it "secure" for android pay. You are a possible threat and this closes that. Suicide_Note It would seem that Google is erecting a wall around their garden, too. EowynCarter While Apple opens iOS more and more. YouNex According to the support/help page, a device is not certified if it stops getting Android updates. How fuck up is that ? I don't get it. My Moto X has always been on stock ROM, yet it's showing up as non certified. Yes it's rooted + system modifications, but at no point is it stated that root prevents it from being certified. Suicide_Note Really? You can't understand why your rooted/system modified device is non-certified? YouNex I know how to read, but this is vague https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/b6f710b8628f0e09ab73ba144c133a2c9b1fe1325b353ae7dc1636f2776b2ac0.png "Not secure" jonzey231 Root and/or unlocked bootloader = Not certified. YouNex It says nothing about root or bootloader https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/b6f710b8628f0e09ab73ba144c133a2c9b1fe1325b353ae7dc1636f2776b2ac0.png ast00 Can't wait until LastPass excludes root users... Fuck them. Adonis K. If they do, I'm cancelling my subscription... Naxx ENVY Fuck them and yet they haven't done anything yet ... #internetlogic Also i know right , crazy for a company that stores your passwords to make themselves more secure . ABSOLUTE CRAZY , RAGE RAGE RAGE Jordan Palmer I don't understand your reasoning or rationale for these two statements. ast00 The second part is related to Google. Sorry about the confusion. Believe it or not, most of us root users keep SELinux in it's Enforcing state. This means we are safe. Nothing gets root rights without us knowing. Our phones are just as safe if not safer than most stock phones. JATIN BANSAL SafetyNet test can be passed using Magisk Manager. I am using it and it works fine for me. Even in play store, my device is certified. May be this helps someone. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/3756499ff5876545740cd0e88e38961bb2c327d90fc43f5801f4bce5d802c990.png https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/44185f640490cb506a68a3414579bd345123f7d52ee2e11802d31d5141db11ae.png Nick Most people are worried about the future when the exploits that Magisk uses are patched and it continues to make it harder for people to get around this. JATIN BANSAL That's what I am also worried about. I just posted this for those who are already rooted and for now want to keep the root. My main purpose of rooting was to flash lineage OS. I think custom rom is the only way of staying updated to latest version of Android as google itself doesn't update their phones after 2 years (18 months I think) for reasons they have. I think if someone buys a flagship device which costs 700$+, it should have 3-4 years of full software update support. 😆😄 2 years of major OS version updates and 3 years of security patches. After 3 years, its time to buy a new phone cuz its so old anyway. trparky Says you! Windows 7 was released on July 22, 2009 and they still support it EIGHT YEARS LATER! And they plan on supporting it until the year 2020 which means it will be supported for a total of ELEVEN YEARS! If Microsoft can do it, Google can too!!! Does Microsoft suddenly say "Your machine is too old, go buy a new one"? No, they continue to give you Windows Updates for years later. We should also be demanding that the Android OEMs do so as well. A Samsung Note 5 has more than enough hardware in it to run Android 7 but no... we can't do that, we need to make money so we don't update them to force you to buy a new device. Lambdadelta Magisk...alright, thanks for the tip-off. I really must get it. TadMSTR Magisk doesn't always pass SafetyNet. I have some devices it fails on. However, several other devices it works just fine. Make sure you turn on the hide root option, it's off by default. Lambdadelta Well, I do have a problem, and that is my device is not able to download it directly from Google Play, so I have to get the APK from XDA. I dunno why this is the case for my phone though. Is it because it's a 4.4.4? Either way, I'll get the APK moved to my phone later tonight. Teodor Axel Johan Jönsson I have activated hide root option, and it passes SafetyNet, but in Google Play Store, it still shows uncertified. What app should I hide root from to get Play Store to show Certified? JATIN BANSAL As per XDA: Q: Safety Net fails after enabling MagiskHide A: Magisk can only hide Magisk core features, for Magisk modules it depends on what the module does. If your ROM itself is not able to pass SafetyNet, then there is nothing Magisk can help. Your best bet is 100% stock ROMs, because your phone manufacturer is forced to release a device passing CTS. Teodor Axel Johan Jönsson What in Magisk Hide did you check/how did you do it? Google Play Store? Or Play services? Because here it says uncertified :( JATIN BANSAL Just clear app data of play store. Now it will show your device certified Teodor Axel Johan Jönsson Thanks! Muzaffar I believe that root and custom rom makes android what it is now. This feels like betrayal for Android enthusiast. username_not_valid Well maybe in the very early days (maybe), but not any more. Rooted phones make up a tiny fraction of active devices. Muzaffar It's not about active devices. It's about how android develop together with community (well as i remember) I believe that those "rooted user" contribute many things that make android right now. I still remember status bar (and nav bar) color change was implemented on Kitkat before it becomes official on lollipop. Also, we can't forget how badly mobile active network bug happens in lollipop if it's not those "rooted user" who found out the fix via xposed. and i believe there are still more. trparky We can blame the OEMs for that kind of stuff because of things like locked bootloaders, eFuses, etc. username_not_valid Or we can blame ROM makers for it because they kept breaking the devices causing warranty claims. Naxx ENVY no offence but that's small thinking ... i'd say 90% of people on Android devices don't want or even know about root, heck it may even be 95% ... security is more of a concern, sure it annoys us geeks, but that's the 5% at most. Muzaffar And about half of android devices is left outdated. Not to mention bugs that unsolved on previous android. I'll pick a dumb phone instead, if android becomes a closed platform. trparky And truth be told that's why I have an iPhone. I simply got sick and tired of the lack of updates so I told myself I'm going to the iPhone and have been happy ever since. OK sure, it may not have all of the customization features that Android has but I can be guaranteed that I will get software and security updates on time, every time, regardless of my carrier of choice. refthemc I think you misread his comment, he's saying that root and custom roms got Android to where it is TODAY not saying that it is necessary TODAY. And I agree. trparky It pretty much comes down to this. Google is simply targeting a much larger piece of the pie. You can't blame them for trying to do what is necessary to protect not only the platform but the Android brand itself. Qwip Well, it isn't like there is anywhere else to go though, is it? Google can basically throw enthusiasts who have promoted and fostered android development under the bus - they don't need them any more. trparky Money trumps community. Always has, always will. username_not_valid Ad blocking was the last holdout reason to root for me, but even thats no longer a good reason with things like Adhell, Adguard etc I have no other reason to root now, custom ROMs are generally garbage, and bloat can usually be uninstalled or disabled, so its just not needed. Adonis K. custom ROMs have nothing to do with root... thevigilante Custom ROMs have uncertified flag in Play Store Mike Avellanosa Not all, though George Byers My Nexus 7 2013 is passing safteynet running Lineage unrooted. Wilton Daniel Pinto Let me guess, you have a Pixel. Or you wouldn't call custom ROMs bloated while the reality is other way round username_not_valid Wouldn't touch a Pixel actually. username_not_valid Should be noted that I didn't call custom ROMs bloated, I guess you misread it. Wilton Daniel Pinto Oh yeah, I misread it . My bad Zach Mauch This is going to cause the same problem I see in governments work with security. They will blindly block things like root and bootloader unlock regardless of if it poses any credible threat because it FEELS more secure. Blah!!!!!! Naxx ENVY it IS more secure, not just " feels" h4rr4r More secure for them, not for me the owner of the device. Besides, not even for them in the long term. An up to date ROM has many exploits patched that a two versions out of date and 12 months behind on security patches OTA has. Zach Mauch What I mean is they will apply restrictions because they easily can and it gives a warm fuzzy for them. They will do this regardless of the impact to the user. The analogy here is that in my job I am constantly unnecessary restrictions and bureaucracy that make doing my job much more difficult. For instance, we are disallowed from using remote desktop on standalone computer networks. It would make our job MUCH MUCH easier in many circumstances and save money on software as I could remote into my PC from anywhere in the building. Yet they deny us that and claim security. jonzey231 So this will force people to install apps from unauthorized sources, thus making the whole Android malware issue that much more prevalent. Great.. Suicide_Note Unless being held at gunpoint, no one is forced to install apps from unauthorized sources. That's a user's CHOICE. jonzey231 You know what I mean. Stop playing devil's advocate on everyone's posts. Eric Braun He's not incorrect. Kyle R Krcmaric "Stop providing an alternate viewpoint to my own." It's just comments. Anyway, I think Google also announced that even sideloaded apps will get scanned by their new Google Play Protect service, which may help nullify the risk of sideloading in the first place. d0x360 That's not an alternate viewpoint unless your view is "don't install any apps ever" There is no logical argument to defend this move by Google. None. username_not_valid Yes there is. Come content creators will not allow a provider to support a rooted or otherwise compromised device. Right or wrong in your eyes thats the reality, and in order for Android to be able to have such services Google have to do this. d0x360 What you said isn't an alternate viewpoint lol you are just repeating the reason Google is doing this which everyone agrees is a fact. As for this new comment...a rooted phone isn't compromised. Tell me...what would a rooted user do with Netflix that would make Netflix want to block them? Are they worried about people copying movies because if they think Android is the vector for that action they are idiots. All they are doing is making a problem by allowing bad actors to inject malware into a Netflix apk that could be installed by both root and unrooted users. Genius! Give me 1 good reason to block rooted phones from an app like oh I dunno, Mario run or whatever it's called. Any answers you give are false. Wanna know why? Hacked apks exist to allow cheating and they can be installed by anyone rooted or not. In fact I'd stake my life that your average unrooted user is installing more modified apk files to cheat in games or whatever than any rooted user. People who root are generally better educated about the Android eco system and do less dumb stuff. As for Netflix I cancelled my account on the day they did this and now I just use a friends account so they lost a subscriber due to this move and I rarely ever used the app. Sure 1 person closing an account that's existed since the day they opened isn't going to do much but I vote with my wallet and if a company does something I dislike then they simply don't get my money. The first person I asked gave me their login info and I made a profile. It's just like how I share my HBO subscription with someone else. Easy easy. username_not_valid See my previous comment. Its not for me to argue, the fact is content providers want it, fair or not, end of story, therefore its going to happen. The tiny number of rooters out there are meaningless to them, and Google. Netflix has to do this because the providers of its non-original content demand it. Its not Netflix fault, they either do it or lose shows. Losing large amounts of their content would affect their subscription base several orders of magnitude more than losing rooted users, who chances are, use the service on more than their phone or tablet anyway. d0x360 Once again I ask... what about a rooted device is dangerous to an app and also this is now a second question, what makes it compromised? BAlGaInTl Clearly you've made up your mind on the issue, but I'll give it a go. It isn't necessarily the root that is dangerous to an app or vice versa. The compromise comes from other apps/processes that can take advantage of root. If you don't understand that, then you don't understand what root really is. It has a lot of valuable uses, but it can also be dangerous. To address your previous statement, just because it rubs me the wrong way. So your "solution" was to cancel your Netflix account and then steal the content? So clearly, you aren't "actually" affected by the change, because you can still watch Netflix. You do realize that watching their content is also valuable to them and makes them money? If you want to boycott Netflix for their practices, then by all means do. Otherwise, it just comes across as hypocritical IMHO. d0x360 I don't believe I asked you. No I'm not stealing Netflix content, it's being paid for and Netflix has many times in the past encouraged account sharing. Of course they did so in the hopes you would join but they still allow it. I paid my Netflix dues. Day 1 4 disc member, then as soon as it was available I upgraded to the 4k 4 user package. It's not piracy either, I'm not recording or distributing the content. If Netflix wants to dick with me I'll dick with them. I never said this was permanent but I vote with my wallet. Vote cast. I also haven't used Netflix once since that day despite being able to. I've been using Amazon and Microsoft video where I own over 500 movies so you can stuff the whole theft argument. I've bought more content than most and that doesn't include my DVD, Blu-ray, and uhd Blu-ray collection which is well over 1400 movies and TV shows at this point. Your right...I've been rooting since the first Android phone but I totally don't understand the possibilities. My argument is simple. The overwhelming majority of root users don't mess with apps. To hell with that nonsense argument anyways. What is the danger to Netflix? Copying movies? Please...it's a million times easier to do it on a PC. Even windows xp can handle it without issue. Does Netflix and you I suppose really think root users are using the app to steal content? If so how? Show me one forum topic, one article, one modified Netflix apk that allows downloading and bypassing their drm. I'm begging you. Just 1. BAlGaInTl I reviewed the Netflix TOS, and I will agree that you are not stealing. I'll even remove the verbiage from my post. Netflix does not make any such stipulation. They speak only of the "Account Owner" and "Devices." I guess I just assumed that, and that's my bad. As I've said in other posts... It isn't all about Netflix. A large part of it is about their content. They really can't argue that point with providers. You either play by their rules, work to establish new rules, or choose not to carry them. Netflix wants to stay relevant on all platforms. That's the main danger to Netflix. In addition, I shouldn't have to give an example in the wild of an exploit. Just because it is difficult to find doesn't mean it doesn't exist. What if someone else writes an app that uses root to mine user account data from Netflix? Should Netflix not be worried about protecting user data? If that happens, who is responsible for the security and the bad press? Probably not Netflix, but they would certainly be impacted. I checked my app really quick (which is stuck on version 4 because I'm affected). Since Netflix keeps you logged in for convenience (that's spelled out in their terms), a quick look gives my full name, username, phone number, zip code, the brand of payment card, and the last 4 digits of that card. That's quite a bit of information that can easily be gathered by a piece of Malware. Now as I said... Netflix probably wouldn't be liable if a user was compromised because of root. It would certainly be a danger to their business however. Why should the be asked to take that risk? It seems to me that they are approaching this in a realistic manner, and rolling it out in a reasonable way. Would this affect the majority of root users? Probably not. By their nature, root users will find ways around it anyway. The problem is that the impact to Netflix from losing content and/or a compromised app is disproportionate the loss of blocking root users. It's simply a numbers game, and you can't blame Netflix for that. And you certainly can't blame Google who is trying to improve security. username_not_valid Thats not for me to decide, or argue, the fact is the content providers have decided that rooting is a risk to their copyrighted content, and as such services like Netflix, Amazon, and other streaming services must comply and lock out rooted devices. Passing safetynet and using Googles DRM framework is the easiest way to claim due diligence, so thats what they will do, and in order to keep Android competitive Google is providing the tools needed to make it possible. What I will argue though is that your notion that custom ROMs etc are more secure is unfounded. The best might well be, but there are hundreds of completely random and unchecked ROMs out there that could contain absolutely anything, you cant possibly claim that custom ROMs are inherently safer or more secure than OEM ROMs, outdated or not. jonzey231 So let's play this out: If someone takes the Netflix .apk and mods it with malware and then signs it, it will pass installation on the device. 1. User opens app. 2. App does whatever shitty thing it's designed to do while the user thinks they just got around the block. 3. The OS scans the app and warns the user it's been modified and they should uninstall it. 4. User thinks "Ha! I know and that's why it works!" 5. User keeps app until they get a call from Credit Karma that their identity was probably stolen but they don't know how. 6. Person spends 6 months fixing stolen identity. But still uses that app the whole time. Ultimately, that user is still going to be screwed. Would you or I make this mistake? No. Would your cousin's friend's dad because he had his son root so he could tether for free and overheard you guys talking about sideloading apps and googled how to do it? Yes. Randroid Problem is, even in your scenario, root has nothing to do with it. Someone who is not rooted could do the same thing. The only problem is, now MORE people who root are going to be *forced* to look for a modified apk because the official apk is not available from the Play Store. So in the end, it's causing more problems than it's fixing. Corbin Baxter Here's the thing about rooting: when you alter your devices software like that, then Google shouldn't be responsible for anything that comes afterwards for the user. This just helps discourage rooting, which can alter a new users perspective on Android, or make someone reconsider getting an Android device. someone755 For what it's worth, back in 2011/2010, many of us bought into Android *because* we could root. Imagine the possibilities of being in control of so much more of your system than with any mobile OS prior; We've spent hundreds (some, thousands) of dollars in this environment, on devices, apps, books etc. I understand this isn't how things stand nowadays, but root is still prevalent because of one issue that Google will not fix (or at least, won't until O+ is running on the majority of devices, but that'll take two years at the minimum), and those are updates and vendor apps (i.e. bloatware). If my phone is stuck on Lollipop I'm going to root it; I'll be able to mitigate the memory leak performance drops, and overall customize the device to fit my specific needs -- I've made quite a few friends (think ROM and kernel devs) because I just wanted to put a thermal engine better than Qualcomm's horrendous MPDecision into the kernel directly (i.e. I took the kernel source and modified it to fit my needs). What Google is trying to do here is, yes, discourage rooting, but instead of fixing the root cause (heh) behind why people root in the first place (that is, again, customizability and personal(ized) performance tuning, in large part to keep devices on older Android versions alive), root wouldn't be necessary. In the long run this *might* fix the symptom, but it most definitely will not help in fixing the cause. And that's because the cause is Google itself. As if apps like Snapchat blocking power users from their apps wasn't enough, now there's this -- If it becomes so common that even Google's own apps start to utilize the feature, I'll be gone to another mobile platform within a month. That might mean iOS, it might mean S60v3, I'll know that if (or rather, when) it happens. tl;dr: Google is putting a band-aid on a shotgun wound. Corbin Baxter I'm speaking mainly for new Android users. They don't feel as comfortable rooting. Doing this makes Android SEEM more like iOS. This doesn't MAKE Android like iOS. New users are comfortable with that. This is the same issue Microsoft had with Windows 8/8.1. Classic users, and Windows enthusiasts, hated someone changing the way they would use their computers. Microsoft introduced a different way of doing things, and to enthusiasts, it was bad, no matter how good it might be. Google's Project Treble should mostly fix the fragmentation problem, therefore giving Android users one less reason to root. To us enthusiasts, nothing can beat rooting, but it might not be the best solution to the problems Android has. Google seems intent on fixing the problems rooting tries to solve, but in a higher-quality and reliable way. No hard feelings😉 trparky They won't understand that, they're too blinded by their geek rose colored glasses. Corbin Baxter I don't expect everyone to understand, but I'll be happy if even a small handful understand what Google is doing here. Dmitri Smirnov > when you alter your devices software like that, then Google shouldn't be responsible for anything that comes afterwards for the user. As if right now Google or the OEMs are in any ways responsible for the malware or unpatched firmware vulnerabilities that stay this way for year. But yes, the users that root are the problem. Corbin Baxter For unrooted phones, yes Google and OEMs are very responsible. But after you root, Android loses most of its security and stability, and rooting is basically tinkering with core system files. Google doesn't have any control over what the user can or can't do after that. bekifft That wasn't even a devil's advocate, that was a straight up strawman. Frosted Butts Yes.. please tell me about all the Netflix alternatives i can install, that can legally stream from Netflix...... Right now, if i am rooted and want Netflix (a service i am paying for), i must go through 3rd party app stores to install the APK. There is no choice at all... R Firestone ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ Umm you have the choice to unroot your device. Maxr1998 ..which is a bad choice for many. d0x360 Yes you do except I rooted my device to make it MORE secure. Unrooting would make my device less secure than sideloading apps would. username_not_valid People can keep saying that, but the content providers have no way to know whether or not you have taken measures to secure your custom device, whereas if they go down this root they know its handled. BAlGaInTl "whereas if they go down this root they know its handled" I see what you did there. 😆😄 ...or just watch Netflix from Chrome! You could even do this from a Linux box with root! 😃 Suicide_Note Sure there is: unroot. Problem solved. neoKushan "I've solved this problem by creating 3 more problems - but it IS solved!" Eric Braun https://www.amazon.com/Netflix-Inc/dp/B005ZXWMUS Option C .. ?? h4rr4r A choice that is now more popular. dcdttu It's not so much about what a user chooses to do. It's about probability. The probability that sites are going to try to lure users into downloading malware-infected Netflix APKs from 3rd party sites is going to go up if you can't download it from a safe source in the first place. This is just like the fact that, if you don't give drug users a safe and clean place to shoot up, they're going to go do it somewhere else that's much more dangerous. Both of these scenarios are bad for society in general, no matter what the original intention was. kgptzac 1/10. Gotta try harder. Premsuraj How? Google Play Protect will still catch malicious apps makapav Yes but you're potentially making people venture through shady sites to get the APKs. Eric Braun Or to Amazons App store or Fdroid. The people going to shady sites are already going there, this isn't going to increase the traffic by any real amount. tehboogieman Are you sure that Google will continue allowing GPP for unlocked or rooted users going forward? Not to mention that it's not a silver bullet for 0days d0x360 It barely works as is. There are tons of apps that slip through every day. Krebs on security reports on them quite frequently. I don't trust Google's scanning of apps at all which is why I root. I can make my phone more secure and I can also image the device as often as I want so if something does happen it's fixed within 5 min. If I unroot then I lose the protection along with the backups. Premsuraj Custom ROMs and root can't protect from 0days either. And just out of curiosity how is root going to provide more security? If anything it makes the device less secure tehboogieman Nobody said root makes a device more secure. Blocking root users from downloading apps from the Play Store puts users at more risk since those users will be more inclined to sideload apps from sources that might not be as reliable as the Play Store. Premsuraj The only people who cares about this are the people who root. And those user's generally tend to be more knowledgeable about what kind of apps and app stores they can trust. ASYOUTHIA✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ And only <2% of users will do this to keep rooted. xxTheGoDxx Only the plus 50 - 100 Million users that have root: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=eu.chainfire.supersu ASYOUTHIA✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ You do realize that that's just downloads right? ...not active users. blindexecutioner I'm not mad. I continue to use things like magisk to help get around stuff like this. All this will do is encourage me to use unauthorized sources for offending apps if magisk ever stops working. There is a reason I use Android over iOS and it certainly isn't because the apps are better designed or whatever. brian. Magisk is a good way around this. However, I don't know how long this will last. I would think with security in mind and developers trying to monetize more, it will put pressure on Google to make SafetyNet get triggered much easier. Obviously, I don't have any way of knowing, but this could easily turn into a cat and mouse game more than it already is. Android Pay was first, other apps did it like Super Mario Run, which who cares, but now Netflix? Changes are coming, and it doesn't look good for the rooting community. D13H4RD2L1V3 I'm not sure if everyone gets why some of us went through the trouble of gaining SU access. Sure, maybe there's a few who went through all that trouble for nefarious purposes (and maybe that got regulatory bodies concerned to the point where Google even needed to consider this) but from my perspective at least, a lot of us gain Superuser access mainly to get features that we liked on other Android flavors, especially in the case of a build of Android that's very close to Google's vision. Such as the ability to hide the navbar at any time we wanted and also to gain theming support (which I feel should be added officially sooner rather than later because I absolutely hate how Google is making their already-bright UI even more eye-searing with even more white-colored elements, which also makes the benefits of OLED much less obvious). I wouldn't be as concerned if these features were pushed to AOSP soon, but as it stands, I feel that Google should probably think about making these features available soon. Marty Thank the bad apples for why you no longer have freedom. Jeremy ディリマ Would changing region firmware with Odin flag the SafetyNet check on Samsung mobiles? Soz if it's a stupid question a lot has changed since I last fiddled with Android Christopher Robert This was a long time coming. Once root user started using root to pirate software, and/or get around geo locks, instead of using it to add feature to their firmware or improve their devices performance, it was only a matter of time before it all got torn down. h4rr4r Get around geo locks? You mean have my device report the location I want it to report? Yeah, how terrible that I control what my computer does. dizel123 You still do. This doesn't affect that at all h4rr4r You said the justification for that was people using their devices for their own reasons in the way they liked. I was pointing out that this is a normal thing and not something that should be punished. Cuvis You don't need root to pirate. You never did. Marty Apple says, Thank you. h4rr4r Sounds like we need a new FREE platform. Maybe Amazon can use this to push their store. mxwp but will the Netflix from the Amazon App Store work on rooted phones? Curt RIP Root. I'm not moving from stock anymore, just cab with the hassle. Until there's a 'reliable' way to hide from Safety Net, I'll enjoy my Android Pay, banking apps and overall smoothness. (If it was up to me, I'd be rooted with Linage) h4rr4r IOS is the platform for you. That was the deal from the beginning. hp-fourtwenty magisk....giyf .y phone is rooted with lineage 14.1, and passes safetynet. problem solved! jcopernicus Fantastic news. Lawstorant All this butthurt for what? You all sound like Magisk doesn't exist. Dave Hamilton Lets take Apple and there closed source. Lets take Google and there open source, the freedom to do and change as you please to make the device yours. No two devices have to be the same. Lets get 115 million android users, and then start deciding you no longer have this choice and freedom to do what you want! When something gets better and better, its only a matter of time before all the things you love are removed and comersilised Eric Braun You still have the option to do what you want. However like everything there are reactions for every action. Want to root or unlock your device? Sure, however there may be a few apps that no longer appear in the playstore. May want to have a backup like Amazon App Store or something similar ready. No one is stopping you, feel free to do as you please. tehboogieman Man, if I have to choose between having a device with root or a device with apps that use day to day, the iPhone goes from a 1% chance of being my daily driver to about 50% There are still a lot that can Android can do that iOS can't, but if I'm living in a walled garden the iPhone is looking pretty attractive. 5+ years of official OS support, solid retail network for quick service or hardware exchanges. The Play Store is my main source of apps that I know are vetted and generally safe. I have no desire to manage app updates manually. There is always a chance that someone will build and maintain an appstore that will have all root blocked apps (maybe the future of APKMirror?). If not it might be the death of Android for users like me Eric Braun Even without all of this I would use an APKMirror App that allowed for updating of apps automatically. dizel123 Google gives app developers more control over their apps. Whiny entitled internet crybabies go on the internet and whine and cry. Aka...Thursday neoKushan Alternatively: Google restricts users from using their device, which they own, how they see fit. dizel123 Except Google isn't restricting anyone from doing anything. But being 100% wrong has never stopped anyone in the internet NubCake being an asshole (in your case) hasn't stopped anyone from commenting eather it seems. dizel123 I can admit to being an asshole. But I'm also right so it's all good. neoKushan It's certainly not stopping you. dizel123 I haven't experienced it so of course it's not stopping me trparky You may own the hardware but you don't own the software, you only have a license to use it. Csöpi Thats so greate. I have a stock oneplus one and for some strange reasons i was failing the test beforhand, but now its all green. Still cant update the netflix app hence chromecast isnt working either anymore. Not really happy. JC If there's a will there's a way. brian. If more developers get on board with this, I can't see why I would switch to Android. I've always been curious about new Android phones, bought a bunch and rooted them all if I could. This is not good for a person like me. d0x360 If Google keeps this up and app devs include the api to block rooted phones then my days using Android will be over and Google will have lost a user who's been there since the g1. I don't know what I'd switch to... probably windows mobile because I'm not a fan of apple whatsoever. It's really a shame because if I had to guess I'd say 99.99% of people who root do so for either the added security and or customized experiences. For example I use root to modify my status bar and quick panel as well as firewall my apps and use adaway and yes Google I do whitelist sites that aren't obnoxious with their ads. John Doe All the more reason for the APK mirror appstore LoL Jan-Lk Else Yeah Google want's us to buy tooooo expensive phones to just get the latest Android, because cheap phones suck at updates and so they need to be flashed and rooted... trparky But if the community raises holy hell with the OEMs then maybe it will be corrected. There's no damn reason why a three year old device can't be updated when an eight year old Windows 7 machine is still receiving Windows Updates. McStagger WHY DOES NETFLIX CARE IF THE PHONE IS ROOTED?!?!?!?! mxwp Netflix does not care, but the content creators that make the stuff you see on Netflix do care. They care because they are idiots who think it is easier to pirate from rooted phones. bekifft Again, Google becomes more and more restrictive. I switched from iPhone because the screens were too small, and Google was far less restrictive. Both of those issues are now resolved, and Google's upped the price of their device to match Apple. May as well switch back to iPhone, Google seems to support it just as much as Android anyway. Luxferro Except it's not just rooted users! Any device with an unlocked bootloader. hp-fourtwenty Your comment sucks for misinforming users about what safetynet is....has NOTHING to do with unlocked bootloaders. Luxferro Sure it does. My Nexus 6P only has an unlocked bootloader, and Netflix disappeared from the play store after the last update. And I'm not the only one, so I suggest you do some reading. TechGuy22 more reason for me to pirate hey, have at it Matías Duarte I hope Netflix does the same with Jailbroken iOS devices. Why they do this btw? To prevent people recording their movies? You can do that with Windows.. Knowledgeborn Allah In all honesty, that'll probably never happen. Jailbreaking iOS opens the doors to a lot of customization on an iPhone, but the security issues are often minimal (with the exception being not having the latest software version). Jailbreaking is pretty much filtered through the Cydia platform. You don't have access to the entire system with a jailbreak. Rooting is completely different, because you can completely reshape the core OS. fbl Note : I don't work for Netflix so I can't comment for them. Possible causes : - the right holders might be pushing for this. I work on roughly the same product area and we don't implement DRM because we like them, we implement them because we contractually have to. -Netflix is tired of getting low notes because of crashes coming by shitty hacks in custom roms. Zach Mauch Anyone know how chromebooks will be affected by this? Will dev mode being enabled cause you to fail SafetyNet Checks? That is currently the only way to install apks on Chromebooks. Branko But Android AOSP!11 -Google 2011 How the times how changed. Wayne Randall ALT arguement, because I don't have time to read every comment... This doesn't limit me and my rooted N6P at all, this move limits how much money they (the devs and Google) are going to make. I can't buy it (the app or coins, or special characters, or bonus content, w/e) if I can't see it. Plain and simple. The important apps will still be there. No app is worth unroot. Block Project Fi from root though... weeeellll. I guess I'd unroot for that. mxwp yeah, only Netflix, banks, and big names will use these blocks. i am guessing most devs want as much exposure as possible. PVL_93_RU Google is actively trying to kill the modding community. Not the Custom ROM makers, but people who root and install Xposed. All because they compromise the security for Android Pay I fear the day root and Xposed apps start disappearing from the Play Store trparky If it comes to security vs being open, security will always win (or at least should always win). Eric Koop I had my Shaw Gateway app update yesterday and they changed it so it doesn't work if rooted. So I had to uninstall and find an APK online of an older version. Now it's just a matter of time before I forget and re-install the update. What a pain... disqus_em5YfkbWdk Well this would certainly get me to cancel Netflix. My personal Plex server is far better than Netflix could ever be anyway. Vivek Rameses Becoming apple more and more every day. Disgusting. Knowledgeborn Allah Android is starting to look more and more like iOS with each update... ¯_(ツ)_/¯ trparky Open platforms rarely stay open once the Benjamins start rolling in. hp-fourtwenty Go ahead and block me...I'll just pirate your app. Play nice and so will I. Start poking me and I'll poke back by never giving you another penny. App devs can't beat XDA devs. It's not going to happen. My unlocked, rooted, rommed and modded device still passes safety net. The day that stops, so does the flow of money leaving my hands on the play store. Luxferro Lay off the sodas.... UniBroW Question, can those of you without access to Netflix on Google play, can it be installed from the Amazon App Store? Stanley C. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/dd381b7e8a39df74c4725712a0db906098c965e9ee4194b6e01e020fd69ee566.png Thats how magisk is made... Magic! Marti Abernathey Yawn. I've got a rooted device and just installed Netflix... because? Magisk. As soon as they made this choice I cancelled. Not because I can't get around it, but because they make me do that. mrjayviper even on a non-rooted LOS mis 5s+, I cannot install Netflix. unlocking the bootloader already tripped safety. And I don't want to root. The features available in non-rooted LOS is enough for me. Teh BuG No. Bueno. TedPhillips Sigh. What's the over-under on this becoming pervasive in the play store... MicroG / Fdroid I'm coming soon. World needs a solid single alternative gcm replacement to catch on. TedPhillips As far as the potential for support overhead, being rooted is generally less than the pain coming from the Xposed/magisk crowd. You need to be actively interfering with an app via root vs code being injected into low levels of the framework that everything uses. TedPhillips I think the best outcome could be that Google opens up their process for little guys to certify there own rom builds, ala let's encrypt lowering friction on getting ssl setup. AOSP should not be a functionally useless base implementation for I'm roms, but something you can use in​ practice. TedPhillips Hey guys, don't worry. Google says Android is for everyone. https://www.android.com/everyone/ That includes AOSP developers too, right? That website seems to tread the line pretty carefully, ala 'no one is forcing you use Google play' but Hiroshi's quote seems like it comes with a grain of salt since he owns Play. I'd love to see AP interview him about this. qkjDlav As an app developer for a large app used globally, the two biggest time wasters in a developer's life are a) debugging device specific issues (HTC, Samsung, etc) and b) crash logs with Xposed in the stack trace. Developers are tired of having to sit around with device farms at their desks just to make sure new features and changes work with each quirky variant of Android that manufacturers want to deploy, and custom roms do make it worse. Enthusiasts are welcome to customize their own versions of Android and sideload apps, but we don't want to see crashlogs in the Developer Console from rooted/custom ROM users. And companies probably don't want to keep paying us to debug issues that only a small minority of users will see. Lê Nguyên Chương Most stupid thing I've ever heard in my life.

Elyse Betters19 May 2017VR HTC Facebook Twitter Pintrest LinkedIn Google+ Mail Comment Google and HTC are making a standalone VR headset together based on the Daydream platform. Google's already made a prototype of the headset, while HTC is readying the consumer version that should be available by the end of the year. In an essay on Medium, Clay Bavor, Google's VP of VR and AR, said this upcoming headset will have "everything you need for VR built in" - including no phone or cables - and that getting into VR will be as easy as picking it up. OK, we'll bite. They've piqued our interest. Here's everything you need to know about this headset, including all the latest details and rumours. Google I/O 2017: All the announcements that matter Google Daydream: What does it do and what devices support it? Standalone Daydream VR is now a reality, HTC and Lenovo onboard Google Daydream: Google's Android VR platform explained What is Daydream? Google's Daydream simplifies access to VR content on a mobile device. There's three aspects: An optimal specification list that manufacturers must meet for a smartphone to be labelled Daydream-ready; a Google-made Daydream View VR headset, although multiple manufacturers could also build their own designs (as long as they meet Google's standards); and an all-in-one hub for VR content called Daydream Home. You can learn more about Daydream from Pocket-lint's guide. HTC HTC Daydream headset: What's the story? Partnership announcement Daydream has so far been an experience that has run on your smartphone, but now, it's making the jump into a standalone headset. While at the Google I/O 2017 developers conference, Google announced it is working with HTC and Lenovo on the first standalone Daydream VR devices. HTC also produces the Vive VR headset, while Lenovo has worked heavily on Google's Tango efforts. Inside-out tracking Google said these upcoming standalone Daydream VR headsets will support inside-out tracking. They will track virtual space using Google “WorldSense" technology, something that's powered by its Tango augmented reality system. Google said it's creating a reference design with help from Qualcomm, and it’s also partnered with HTC and Lenovo to manufacture the standalone headsets. Design Google and HTC have only only revealed an outline of the headset alongside a Daydream-like controller. A prototype version was seen by Backchannel and described as clunky, though it apparently offers a better experience than the Gear VR or Daydream VR. A rendering system called Seurat enables it to have high performance with low power and greatly optimised 3D graphics. This prototype and its tracking system means Google plans to take on Oculus, which has also teased early standalone headsets with self-contained tracking systems. It also reminds us of Microsoft’s Mixed Reality Headset development kits with inside-out tracking. New #Daydream standalone headsets from partners like @htcvive won't require a phone or PC. #io17 pic.twitter.com/7TpYPJGEdU — Google (@Google) May 17, 2017 Portable VR experience HTC revealed in a blog post that it is "perfectly positioned to deliver the most premium standalone headset and user experience" and that the Vive standalone VR headset will provide a "deeper and more immersive portable VR experience than ever before". It also promised to announce more information on the headset soon, but said it will be "simple, easy-to-use and with no cables to connect". You should be able to just pick it up, put it on, and be fully immersed in your new reality, according to HTC. Release date and price There was no release date or price announced on stage, though Google said HTC's standalone Daydream VR headset will arrive later in 2017. Backchannel said that Google has developed a prototype and that HTC will release a commercial version “in the coming months.” It should cost somewhere in the "mid-hundreds range". The Oculus Rift and HTC Vive are in the $600 to $700 range. HTC Is this different from HTC Vive 2 Oasis? Most likely. HTC introduced the HTC Vive VR headset in 2015 and started selling it last year, and by late 2016, the company was rumoured to be working on a second-generation version, codenamed Oasis. According to @LlabTooFeR, who has leaked accurately in the past, HTC was developing a refreshed version in November, though it was unclear if the new Vive would be standalone or just a slimmer, lighter version. Anything else you should now? HTC is making a mobile VR headset unlike anything we've seen so far Now that we've delved into what Google announced at Google I/O 2017, it's important to note that HTC revealed in early 2017 that it was making a mobile VR headset. At the time, it was described as something different than Google Daydream View and similar headsets. According to CNET, which spoke to Chief Financial Officer Chia-lin Chang, HTC developed a VR product compatible with the U Ultra: “We have a good plan in terms of combining mobility with VR,” Chang said. “Vive is very top end, and in the coming months you'll see our plans in terms of mobility and VR, and it's not a phone slapped onto a headset ... It'd be a different thing.” HTC already sells the HTC Vive headset, which is a lot like the Oculus Rift in that it needs to be tethered to a PC, though it also offers an add-on that turns the headset into a standalone device, but now it's apparently developing something altogether different. The company specified that it wouldn't work like Google's Daydream View, which use a phone for its screen, sensors, and processing power. CNET itself labeled the upcoming device as a "new virtual reality toy", while Chang was a bit more vague. He did suggest, however, that it was a device that'll sit somewhere between the full-fledge Oculus Rift headset and a mobile VR headset like Daydream View.

Netflix was just the start: Google Play Console lets developers exclude app availability for devices that don't pass SafetyNet Rita El Khoury Follow View All Posts 2017/05/18 3:57am PDTMay 18, 2017 93 Plus 1 on G+ 108 Share on Facebook 82 Share on Twitter Total Shares283 Google News Last weekend, a huge turmoil swept the root-enthusiast Android community as it was discovered then confirmed that the Netflix app was being blocked from showing up in search results on the Play Store for rooted devices. At the time, Netflix said it was using Widevine to block unsupported devices, but that made no sense to us: the app was still functional if it was sideloaded, it was only not showing up as compatible in the Play Store. So what sorcery was Netflix really using?! Turns out it's a new function of the Google Play Console. As part of the updates announced for the Play Console at I/O 2017, Google mentions a new Device Catalog section under Release management that lets developers choose with intricate granularity which devices their app supports on the Play Store. Devices can be viewed and excluded by many attributes including RAM and SoC, but the important factor we're interested in is SafetyNet Attestation. New "Device catalog" lets devs manage the exclusions. Developers will be able to choose from 3 states shown in the top image: not excluding devices based on SafetyNet, excluding those that don't pass integrity, or excluding the latter plus those that aren't certified by Google. That means any dev could potentially block their apps from showing and being directly installable in the Play Store on devices that are rooted and/or running a custom ROM, as well as on emulators and uncertified devices (think Meizu and its not-so-legal way of getting Play Services and the Play Store on its phones). This is exactly what many of you were afraid would happen after the Play Store app started surfacing a Device certification status. This is different from the full SafetyNet API implementation that apps like Android Pay and Pokémon Go use. In the case of Pay/Go, the attestation check happens when the app is installed on your phone and doesn't allow it to run unless it passes the integrity test. But in the case of the Play Console, the attestation check happens when you're browsing the Play Store and only affects the availability of the app for your device. If the full SafetyNet API isn't included in the app itself, you will still be able to grab the APK from other sources, install it, and the app will work just fine. Still, this spells trouble for rooted users and the Android enthusiast community as a whole. Google keeps erecting more and more obstacles each day in the face of root and custom ROMs and even if this won't stop root users who should be knowledgable enough to know how/where to grab an APK and install it, it will make things more and more difficult and maybe less and less worth the trouble. But y'all are rebels and you'll keep on finding a way around it, won't you?

Nice move Google. Suicide_Note Not sure if serious, but either way, this was just a matter of time. YouNex Obviously not serious EowynCarter So, question : Is there anyway to get android O in the future on my nexus 6 and not having problems with this ? IF manufacturer where taking care of updating their devices, wouldn't be an issue... saf1927 If Magisk keeps working, yep. You can. Even my old Nexus 5 is on 7.1.2 and it passes SafetyNet. EowynCarter I want "just work" stuff. Not workaround. Maybe Magisk does the job for some, but not an acceptable solution from my point of view. Mainly the "we don't know if it will keep on working" part. saf1927 Well, it's the best solution so far and it has improved a lot since its inception. I never bothered since the Nexus 5 was a secondary device for me, but now that some apps won't show up anymore on the Play Store, I simply flashed Magisk and that's about it. I haven't tweaked anything. Plus, if you are already flashing a custom ROM, flashing an extra zip file isn't that much work anyway. EowynCarter True, but it's the phone I use dailly. I don't want apps sudendly not working, becasue google decided to push an update that broke magisk. mxwp well if you want things to "just work" then i guess get an iPhone EowynCarter Sadly, I'm beginning to think about that. But that would cause others frustrations. ED-Zが現れた! Well, people will just flock to root-supported apps... Milton P. I actually forgot when was the last time I Rooted a device. No biggie. Suicide_Note The bad thing is it isn't just root that causes problems. Simply unlocking the bootloader will produce the same result. Maxr1998 Just because it's no biggie for you, it doesn't mean everyone approves this. I am actually pretty concerned, because this limits the freedom over our devices even more.. Milton P. Define freedom, please. Maxr1998 Software freedom, to be more specific. You should have the freedom to use and modify your device and it's software however you'd like, and have fill control over it. That means, root access. And since the AOSP core IS free software, the 4 freedoms defined by Richard Stallman apply to it. What this change now introduces is that you're forced to decide between either giving up the freedom over your device or not using the app you wanted to download (which will probably have to be my choice, and that sucks). Milton P. But you're not giving up anything, you just have to make a choice. If you put that way, Google has the freedom of doing with the AOSP core whatever they want, the same way you can modify said core and do as you please, the difference is Google has more money and more responsibilities when it comes to their user base. XDA and other sites will still have a bunch of developers making whatever they please (within the AOSP terms) with the AOSP core. This will just change thinks for the people that use those ROMs bit realistically the vast majority of users won't feel the changes. Sad but true. h4rr4r That choice is giving up freedom you had before. The vast majority will see the rate of Android improvements slow as the Devs on XDA and the like lose interest. Android only exists because of Linux, now it is turning its back on that whole culture. Milton P. Well, I don't see your freedom compromised to be honest with you, but we're seeing things from different angles so that's that. Sorry for your loss in that case. h4rr4r You do not think losing control of your device is a loss of freedom? Milton P. Nope, is just a device, I have more important stuff going on, m device is a tool the same way a hammer is a tool, you can buy a hammer and use it as it is. Sometimes my device is a toy, if I buy a remote control car I'll modify it as long as it is possible, the same way I modify my phone. I have control over my phone. I can install whatever I want at my own risk. If I decide to root my phone I expect things to be broken. I remember when I had an HTC and I hated sense so I decided to install a custom ROM, I gave up the camera and I was aware of it. There was always some compromises with custom ROMs, nothing is changing. I rather have a safe device then a compromised one today, still my choice thou. h4rr4r So you want IOS. Got it. Over here I want freedom. I don't think homedepot should be allowed to tell me what I can hit with the hammer I bought. trparky Open platforms rarely stay open once they become popular. Once the Benjamins come rolling in it tends to override open. h4rr4r Tell that to Linus Torvalds. I am sure he will have many many fuck yous for you. trparky Linux is the rare situation. h4rr4r The rare situation like many others that created android and even google. trparky Yeah but look at Android, the walls are closing around it and there's nothing you can do about it. Face it man, the geeks may have built the system but the common man now rules it. Geeks love choice, yes, they do love their choice but your average person doesn't give a rat's ass about choice. All they want is a device that does what they need it to do when they want to do it. They have no inclination to learn how it works or why it works just as long as it does. This is what geeks do not and refuse to understand. h4rr4r Sure there is, stop using it. Then the common folks will have to follow us to the next platform. trparky As long as their is money involved in maintaining Android it doesn't matter if something better comes along, people will continue supporting Android because it makes them money. Money makes the world go round, get used to it. Maxr1998 ^ What @h4rr4r:disqus says. trparky Yep. The root and ROM community is such a small portion of the Android ecosystem that they really don't matter to them. People have been screaming at Google for years to get the Android house fixed up, this is them doing just that. You can't blame them for doing what the people have asked for. mxwp I agree with you, but sadly you only have freedom over hardware. You can do what you want with the device you buy. But with software you never actually buy it... you only buy a license to use it. Thus you have no real freedom with software. Maxr1998 Android is free software, Apache 2.0 license. At least the AOSP part of it. trparky But the Google parts of it are not covered under the Apache 2.0 license. That's essentially why ROM developers can't package the Google Play Services pack with the ROM itself and instead requires you to download a separate ZIP package from Google to install it separate from the ROM package. Android itself may be free and open but the Google Play Services part is not. Sudev There are far more than few arguments against root access but here are some: Root access is meant for experimental & development purpose and not for Daily Driver for any average user of the platform. Google Play Services & Apps available on Play Store are not "Free Software". Google as provider of Play Services infrastructure has much more liabilities then one can simply assume. And also the app developers have responsibility to protect end users' data. If device has root access available and any rouge app / maleware steals other apps data which is possible, who will be at stack? h4rr4r The ability to do anything I want with my things that I own. Milton P. You​ can do whatever you want with your device, nobody is stopping you. You might see that some apps are not showing up in the play store but you can still side load them, I still see freedom in your future. h4rr4r For how much longer? Soon these apps will ask play services if they are supposed to be installed on that device, at that point you can say goodbye to sideloading. If this is what people want then IOS was the platform for them. thecoolkid Ok Google, define freedom... 😁 Nick I would imagine a great deal of people on this site will be upset, but in actuality I don't think this will affect the user base of many apps that badly h4rr4r Not in the short term. However in the long term it will. Android only exists because of the FREE software movement. Nick Yes, but that doesn't apply to applications, which this is about. h4rr4r Think long term. Same thing applies. trparky No it won't because the root and ROM community is so small it doesn't matter to Google anymore. The 95% of people who simply want a device that works don't care and likely won't ever care. As long as they can play NetFlix, Pokemon Go, or whatever is the next craze they don't care. h4rr4r Again, that is short term thinking. Think past the end of your nose. Android exists because of linux. Google needs this small group to create the very stuff they rely on. trparky You overestimate the value that the community has now. Android may have needed the community back in the beginning to gain the foothold that it has in the market but not so anymore. Android has near 100% market penetration, they have achieved world domination. They don't need the community anymore, they have achieved their goals. h4rr4r Until they are unseated. IBM once had a monopoly on computing devices. They did not need the community to gain a foothold, they would not have a product to gain a foothold without the community. Android only exists because of a collection of those projects. trparky No, Android exists because Samsung, HTC, and LG make devices people want and it makes them money by the semi-truck full. The community doesn't mean shit now, all that matters to these companies is one thing... money, money, and more money. Oh, and did I mention money? This is capitalism man, money rules the world. If you don't make money you are dead. h4rr4r Please tell me how that would have happened without linux. Money loses to good engineering every day. Look at how linux killed solaris. trparky Tell me why Windows is the defacto monopoly on the desktop despite the fact that Linux is better in every damn way possible under the hood? That's right... money. h4rr4r Because the desktop is dead. The fight is over. They lost. Even money can't keep them relevant. trparky Oh, you're funny. The desktop is not dead, it will never be dead. When people need to do real work, they sit down at a desktop. When people want to play real games, they sit down at a desktop. When people need to type out anything longer than a page like a college term paper, they sit down at a desktop. The desktop is king and will always be king. Long live the desktop! h4rr4r The Desktop is a dead man walking. When they do real work, they use a Citrix session. When they game they use a console, or they are already nerds. When people type they can use a fucking chromebook. The desktop as you think of it died already. trparky Try and say that shit over at TechPowerUp, HardOCP, Overclock.net, TomsHardware, etc. and trust me when I say this... you'll be run out of town by people with pitchforks and torches. h4rr4r Those are all nerds. Those are the folks who have desktops running 3 different OSes. They are the folks who are pissed about android being locked down. trparky And your point being? You just admitted that only the "nerds" care about Android being open. Sure, those same "nerds" will go off and create a new platform but the rest of the people who are living in the real world and who don't care one damn bit about how it works will continue to use Android. h4rr4r Those people will eventually move to the new platform. Just like they did with Android. trparky And the same thing will happen to that platform in the future that's happening to Android now. Open platforms are nice and all, I'll admit that, but your average person doesn't care one bit. I dare you to go up to any person on the street and ask them anything about Android. What phone do they have? What model? Most will say "I don't know, something that my carrier gave me for cheap." h4rr4r The wheel of computing we call it. It has happened and will happen again. So what? trparky Which reinforces the idea that I said before, eventually all open systems will become closed (or less open) at some point in their life cycle. It usually happens when it becomes popular with the common man. Why? Because like I've been trying to get through your thick skull, the average person doesn't care how any of this stuff works so long as it works. h4rr4r The average person does not matter. Few open systems become closed. AOSP is still fine. trparky What the hell do you mean by "they don't matter"? They're the ones buying the devices, buying the apps, looking at the ads, etc. Just how the fuck does that translate to "they don't matter"? h4rr4r Because they don't. They don't create, they don't cause new things to be created. They are just users, just like I don't matter to how movies are created. trparky But without money from the people who are consuming said things developers won't make new stuff. Developers do have to eat you know and put a roof over their heads. h4rr4r The giant world of FOSS pretty much proves you wrong. Demand cannot create supply. I don't pirate anything kiddo. I have way too much to lose for that. One of those lawsuits I would actually have to pay, since I could. trparky I'll give a hint on how FOSS works a lot of the time. Some of the top tier Linux kernel developers actually work for companies and they just contribute code in their free time. They may work for Intel, AMD, nVidia, or God knows what but only after their day job is done. Why? Because they need money and they need to eat. This is a basic requirement for people in this world. They need money!!! People don't just write code for the love of it, even Linus Torvalds who's in charge of the Linux kernel itself works for the Linux Foundation and yes, he gets paid for his work to the tune of $10 Million a year. Sorry to burst your bubble man but FOSS projects aren't all happy, happy, joy, joy here... people need to be paid real money to be able to eat, drive a car, put a roof over their heads, etc. On second thought, I'm not sorry I burst your bubble! You need it burst! PEOPLE NEED TO BE PAID REAL FUCKING MONEY!!!! h4rr4r No, they get paid to contribute. During the work day. Not as a hobby. Lots of projects are like that. I won't say exactly how I know about that ;) Their employers just aren't as short sighted as you. Linus did not however create linux to get rich. Great code like great art gets created because it must be. People do what they love. Kid, you will get it one day. When you have enough that you aren't worried about it each day, money stops being that big of a deal. Don't worry everybody goes through a phase like you are now. trparky Dude, we are not the Federation of Planets here living in a happy, happy, joy, joy world in which people can just do whatever they want to do without a care in the world. As long as human greed exists there will always be a need for money. And believe you me, greed will never go away unless we breed a new kind of human and I don't see that happening any time soon. Gene Roddenberry's future will never happen, it just won't. Contrary to a lot of geek dreams it just won't. h4rr4r No idea where you got that idea. Never suggested it. My point was the personal relative value of increasing income drops as income goes up. If you make minimum wage doubling your income is a huge deal. Adding the same amount to my income would not get me to take a job I like less. Offering it to Linus would be a waste of time. Yes, some people will keep chasing dollars, they are the exception not the rule. The employers are working on enlightened self interest. Either they use the FOSS product, gain market advantage with direct knowledge, use it for marketing or believe they are getting something else. PostgreSQL for example has a lot of paid contributors who work for companies that either provide customization, consulting or depend on the project. Others just because it increases quality. Commercial software by and large is not high quality. I have seen a lot of it and 90% if you tried to submit it to a FOSS project of any size would get you denied and possibly mocked. This system continues to be more innovative because it is easy to continue to expand. Anyone with a good idea can fork if their idea is not accepted. trparky > My point was the personal relative value of increasing income drops as income goes up. Tell that to the people in Washington or any CEO that demands ever increasing yearly salaries and end of year bonuses all while raping the companies that they work for. Tell that to the psychopaths on Wall Street. For as long as their is money, people will want more of it. Anyone who says that they don't is flat out lying. h4rr4r Those are the exception not the rule. That is why you call them psychopaths. Honestly, correcting for inflation I really don't care that much if I ever make more. Would it be nice sure, would I give up anything I like about my job? No. If you could double my income but it prevented me from contributing to FOSS projects or owning code I generate off the clock, I would not take that deal. If money was enough to make people do anything MS would have offered Linus $11 million a year to not write it. Heck, Sun would have done it while they were still around. trparky Either you're a child that doesn't know how the adult world works or you're a fucking troll. h4rr4r So you have no idea who makes stuff, neat. I guess you think Henry Ford should have made a faster horse. trparky Oh, I know who makes the stuff I use but I also make sure that they are paid! I give money to those developers who write the programs that I enjoy and if I can't pay them I won't use their programs. I only use a program if I can pay for it. I have put money into their tip jars on their web site, I look for PayPal links and I donate even if it's something small like $5. They deserve it! h4rr4r Good for you! There is a lot of great software that does not make money that way. Some even just ask is that you follow the license, like linux which mediatek steals by not releasing kernel source. So I hope you avoid buying that kind of thing. trparky MediaTek controller chips are known to suck so I don't buy them out of that reason alone. h4rr4r Now I have given you another good reason to avoid them. Bunch of thieves. Rita El Khoury I don't even remember when I last bootloader unlocked. But I know this move toward closing the ecosystem further and further will have ripples in the future. The enthusiast community flocked toward Android for its openness and we have custom ROMs and their enterprising devs to thank for HUNDREDS of new features that they implemented first and everyone clamored for and applauded until they became features in AOSP. If Google thinks it can steer this ship alone and it knows best what to do next, we may have less and less interesting features in the future and more and more of what only one entity thinks is best, not a diverse set of opinions. Nick Given that this only gives the developer the option of requiring these checks, it makes me believe that Google had to do this for some companies that have regulatory or other kinds of requirements. Which is a shame for the rooted (and unlocked?) community, but understandable. Shame Google is most likely going to take the blame here in this comment section though. Rita El Khoury Well, maybe they had to, but that won't stop any developer from implementing it without any regulatory or legal requirement pushing them to do so. Nick Right, which puts this choice on the developer, not Google. Google was stuck behind a rock and hard place, perhaps. EowynCarter Well, google is certainly to blame for not planing to update my nexus 6 to android O. And now I can't even use custom rom as plan B without losing some apps :( Suicide_Note Boo hoo. Buy a new phone and quit crying that Google doesn't support phones forever. EowynCarter Fine can you order a pixel XL and ship it to me in France ? Plus, my nexus 6 still works, I hate having to replace working stuff. Makes no sense, economically and ecologically speaking. Suicide_Note I'll sell you my XL when I'm done with it, but only after i get the Pixel XL 2. :) EowynCarter Well, I do hope Google sells the "pixel 2 "( or whatever its name) here. For now, I'm'just hoping my nexus 6 don't break. Else I might jump on the iOS ship. I'm not convinced the the other android alternatives. Note 8 would be the closest, but touchwiiz, delayed updates.... I'm spoiled after a few years with a nexus. Suicide_Note There always eBay or Swappa if you want to get a first gen Pixel. I was looking at prices over the weekend, and mint condition Pixels are going for about $450. EowynCarter Not so much in France. And eBay for suff that cost more that a few bucks, too risky. Plus, the pixel is getting "old" by now. Wilton Daniel Pinto Troll found trparky Yet Microsoft still supports Windows 7 EIGHT YEARS LATER! How come Microsoft can do that yet Google can't? Alex Louderback Actually, that's Qualcomm EowynCarter Source for this ? trparky And Qualcomm can go fuck themselves. Gee... I wonder why they're being hit with an anti-trust lawsuit. Could this be one of many reasons why? trparky Yes, Google is to blame for that. There's no damn reason why your Nexus 6 can't run Android O other than the fact that they just don't want to. Bojan Bunić My bootloader was unlocked prior to changing the mobo on my 5X, courtesy of Booty Loops. Root, well, probably before I got my Nexus 4. Although I'll see how it'll go on in the future, as we don't have Pixels here, so the only near stock possibility is either OnePlus, or some other device and a custom ROM. Milton P. Agree 100% with you, I mean I remember the old days when I hated HTC's Sense, I literally decided that a phone without a camera was better than whatever HTC did back then, but Android has evolved quite a lot nowadays, don't get me wrong, I do believe that custom ROMs did a great job showing Google what the users want but that won't change, as long as someone shows Google what people want Google will keep improving Android, because there's no limits. Now if they go the Apple way and lock EVERYTHING then we'll be fucked, I'm the meantime developers will find a way around the system pushing Google along. Premsuraj An open bootloader and root actually solves a lot of problems still existing in AOSP. The Nougat update absolutely destoryed the battery life of many Nexus 6P devices, with Google only focussing on the Pixels, there was no fix in it. I unlocked, used Franco Kernel + naptime + Greenify and I now I get adequate battery life. Another feature I can think of is theming. Material design is good, but the whiteness is rage inducing Maxr1998 Well, fuck them. Let's just hope not many devs will use this, and Google won't enable this by default anytime soon. Maxr1998 The more I think about this, the more concerned I get. This will reduce the freedom over our devices, and also limit developers in the awesome things they could do before because of Android's openness. I am all in for device security and fighting against malware, trojans and phishing applications, don't understand me wrong, but that doesn't mean that you have to take people away their freedom - just look at how Linux (GNU and Linux) is doing it. Tom Westrick How does this limit developers? If anything it gives them more control. Maxr1998 Fair point, I should have been more specific. With "developers", I meant rom developers and modders, app developers only if they require root access for their apps. "Normal" developers can use this to enforce a "secure" (read: DRM locked-down) environment, but that's not really a good thing in my opinion.. (Refer to my other comments.) trparky You're angry at the wrong people, you should be angry at Hollywood; they're the ones that are demanding this kind of stuff. Their content, their rules; it's how things are in the real world. They have to do what they need to do to protect their investments, plain and simple. We don't necessarily have to like it, hell... we may even hate it, but that's how it is. You want the content? Play by their rules. Colin Richardson If you are an app developer and want your app to run on custom roms..... don't turn on "Requires SafetyNet"... bekifft We are increasingly living in the future Richard Stallman warned us about. With Google taking all these steps, may as well go back to using jailbroken iPhones. Bart Janusz I've already enabled it and I know at least 3 others devs that did it as well. I really don't care about root per se, but custom roms and xposed is source of countless problem as both are buggy as hell. Maxr1998 But in which way does that influence you? Xposed can introduce bugs to the system, sure, but it won't affect the performance of your app unless it itself is modded, so you probably don't have to fear bad reviews for bad performance anyway. And custom roms? LineageOS on my mother's Moto G runs like a champ and much better than the 5.1 stock rom before. And in my experience as a dev, there were much more incompatibilities with Samsung TouchWiz than with AOSP-based custom roms. refthemc I'm sure he's just trying to avoid the headache of emails he gets daily from users who have no idea that it's their fault the app is not working or crashing... Bart Janusz Indeed, not to mention extra crash and ANRs reports which seems to influence app positioning. Maxr1998 But why? The device may behave more buggy at some parts because of Xposed (and mine definitely ran like shit on MM because of some mods, but I NEVER blamed any apps), but the apps itself won't run worse if not modded - normally they should even run better if you only use performance mods like Greenify, NLP Collector wakelock disabler and other light mods. I don't think he gets many reports anyway, considering what @marcusmarcus2:disqus said. Bart Janusz You may not, but many users do, and as I said there are a lot of bogus ANRs and crash reports. Since my app depends heavily on low level OS elements both custom ROMs and xposed are deal breakers (and you really should check source, since I do not update my website as I moved to G+/FB but app has sizable user base given its niche and I'd to deal with ROM/xposed issues fequently). Maxr1998 Well, but the same type of users also give bad reviews etc. without using any mod or root. You generalize modders to only cause problems, and therefore lock out everyone. About your app/website thing: fair point, I didn't look at it yet, and have to apologize for being a little rude. marcusmarcus2 You need to take your own advice, "you really should check source". If you moved to G+/FB, then why does your app on the play store still point to the same website as well. Or at least put a link on the old website that directs to G+/FB. There is nothing that points to your so called G+/FB source. So @Maxr1998:disqus has no other source to check at the moment. Bart Janusz Not that I care but if you try to draw conclusion about app you should probably visit Play Store listing. Anyhow that's really not important I just chimed in to explain why developer will use this. I've choose to do so due to extra burden which in effect hurts majority of my user base, one of my colleagues cited lucky patcher and freedom (which I think is not such a good idea but its his choice). trparky You may not blame the apps because you know better but most people don't understand that, most people see a crashing app and suddenly you see, as the developer, a ton of comments saying that your app sucks. h4rr4r Please do tell us about your apps so we can be sure to avoid them on any devices we have not yet rooted. marcusmarcus2 His disqus profile leads to this website http://artflowstudio.com/ which has a few apps listed. Art oriented apps. There is only 1 update on that website since 2014, so I don't think I would be to concerned about installing one of his apps. Jordan Palmer Nice detective work. Adrian I can see a lot of refund requests coming from people who paid for apps and suddenly are told "Nope. Not for you anymore." A lot of us are rooted and buy apps and you'd better believe noise will be made if an app I use daily, that I paid for, suddenly breaks with an update because it's no longer blessed by the dev to run on my device. It's your app and you can do what you want with it, but there is always another side to the coin. BAlGaInTl That's not the way that Netflix worked it, and I doubt other developers of paid apps would either. I have a OnePlus One, that I run Lineage OS on since the original Cyanogen OS is now defunct and does not receive any updates. Netflix simply doesn't update to v 5+. It still works just fine. I may not get the newest and latest features, but part of that is on me for using a device that is dated. I'm not one of those users who, because I paid for an app once, fells that I should get all of the updates from now until the end of time. That isn't sustainable for developers. It could very well be that Netflix has some new features/offerings in the works in which they are getting pressure from outside sources to push this. A lot of valid reasons for a developer to enable the check exist. As long as they do it in the same manner that Netflix has, I don't see the issue. Adrian And just like Pokemon Go, eventually you'll get a message that you need to upgrade to the latest version or the app won't work, you know, that new version that won't let you actually log into it anymore. We've already seen this happen so let's not pretend that it isn't the next logical step. They aren't going to keep letting people sign in indefinitely with an app that doesn't have the security level they want. It's naive to think that hey I can just stick with the last version that works for root. It takes all of what, the time it takes to create a switch that says minimum version required to log in is "DRM version" BAlGaInTl Good Point. I recognize that. But it seems that the blame (in general) is being directed at Google in many of these posts. If that scenario happens, it isn't Google that blocked you from accessing Netflix. The need for this level of security is on the increase. The same users demanding better security and longer updates are the first ones to cry foul when Google starts laying the groundwork for exactly what they have asked for. Adrian I think there is a way to do both that doesn't piss off a very active community that helped take Android from a very very very ugly, second class OS to what we have now. I know a lot of us remember just how crippled Android was and it was the root/mod community that produced the bulk of what is now standard on Android. There needs to be a way to secure the devices AND not turn their back on the developer community that contributes. The idea, in Netflix's case, that root = pirate is insane. Why in the world would someone prefer to rip content on their phone to say a computer or XBox that is never going to move and can do it while you get on with your life? They're doing something for the sake of saying they're doing something, but if they think it's going to make a dent in piracy they, and the studios are nuts. I watch a lot of Netflix and still prefer to buy discs. People who do things the right way and are perfectly happy paying for content shouldn't have to jump through hoops to watch it. Those of us who root usually have a handful of things that stock Android is not doing for us. It's why we root. If all of these things were available in stock, my reasons for rooting would disappear but I don't see that happening any time soon. I think Android is getting so much better but if they make it exactly like iOS, might as well go to the dark side because Apple's apps tend to be more polished, come out first and OS updates are frequent. Don't bite the hand that feeds you just because you're getting more popular. BAlGaInTl I think that Netflix is a good example. It is HIGHLY likely that the reason for recent unpopular changes (see also VPN blocking) are being driven by other entities. It isn't that Netflix thinks its a problem, but the people that control a large portion of their content do. root pirate but it does introduce a security risk. I don't see how Google is turning their backs on developers. Developers are free to develop as they see fit and choose (at least for the moment) whether or not they will implement the SafetyNet check. The inherent problem is that a circumvented security is still circumvented and can no longer be considered secure. I can clearly see why some apps would and should frown upon that. Maybe not Netflix and Mario (IMHO), but certainly something like bank and payment apps. I don't think the inherent open nature of android will ever reduce to the level of iOS. But some changes have to occur to meet the needs/desire of the majority. Security is inherently difficult. The easier and more flexible you try to make it, the less secure it becomes. Adrian I do think banking apps should run in a secure space. Completely agree with that, but I disagree with root = less secure. My nexus devices stopped getting OS and security updates. Nothing. VERY insecure and dangerous. I rooted them, updated the OS with images from XDA developers and my devices that were once easy targets are more secure. There is always two sides to it. I see that Google is finally trying to take security seriously on Android and doing things in layers that completely cut out the vendor AND the carriers is the right step. Right now, Root is the only way to update a perfectly good device like my Nexus tablet tablet that the vendor said "oh well" to. Until Google has a REAL strategy in place to keep ALL Android devices secure, root will be necessary. Not everyone wants to or can upgrade devices every two years because they get abandoned. My father doesn't need an S8. He does need a device that gets security updates for more than a year after purchasing his phone. BAlGaInTl You are exactly correct, and I'm in the same situation with my OnePlus One. But in working to increase your security level, you leave holes behind. The key words that you used are "more secure." I agree. You are "more secure." But still (probably) less secure than a device that has been thoroughly tested, certified, and passes SafetyNet without hacks. Google has been open that they are working on security updates. They have improved significantly over the last couple years in getting those out. I feel that they are putting in place a real strategy to keep Android devices secure. This is part of that groundwork. I also feel that they are actively looking to replace Android in it's current state, and I can't say I blame them. The only real strategy may be to take lessons learned and start over. Lucky for them, they have the resources to do so. trparky > take lessons learned and start over Pretty much. The worst thing that they did from the very beginning was to allow for the OEMs to do what they wished. Google essentially made a deal with the devil when they released Android to the world. They wrote no requirements into the Android agreements that the OEMs agreed to to require updates to be a necessary thing. Big mistake Google. BAlGaInTl The really needed to in order to get their foot in the door of the market. If it would not have been open source from the beginning, none of the major manufactures would have bought off on it. The fact that they could use it for free (essentially) and still be able to customize on top of it is what sold it. trparky And now look at it, Android is a fucking mess of non-updated insecure devices that are ripe for anyone to be able to take over and turn into a botnet. trparky And you should be raising holy hell with the OEM that made that device! Just because your device is old doesn't mean that it shouldn't still be supported. Windows 7 is nearly eight years old and it still receives Windows Updates. Why can't your device? BAlGaInTl Normally, I would agree, but the OnePlus One is a special case. The OEM operating system is the now defunct Cyanogen OS. I had to balance having the original OS without updates, or running another with updates. The phone is now almost three years old. If I bought a PC with Windows on it three years ago, and Microsoft had since gone out of business, should the PC manufacturer be responsible for providing Windows 7 updates? Even though the PC is beyond it's support date? Sure, I can increase the security by switching to another OS that is updated. It may even be a Windows clone. But if a software developer decided to only support "original, unmodified" PC configurations, that would be within their right. trparky But it can be adapted to run LineageOS. Sudev There is bit difference in analogy here: OnePlus manufactured the phone and Cynogen Inc customized AOSP Android OS for it, they didn't developed it from ground up. I understand that Cynogen INC is out of business now too. However in PC world, it would be the case that you purchased a PC from Dell and get Microsoft Windows OS with some additional Dell software. If Dell or developer of that custom software goes out of business you still get OS update for your PC. Its not android OS itself out business here. Adrian and for the record, I absolutely agree that it was the content providers and not all on Netflix. trparky You should be demanding that OnePlus send an official update to your device. So what if your device is old? It should be still supported. Windows 7 is still supported nearly eight years later, why can't your device be supported for that long as well? Plumplam Who cares except for a bunch of XDA nerds? If it means better security then I'm all for it. Dmitri Smirnov Well, for starters, it doesn't mean better security, since it does nothing to address the problems with vulnerable outdated android versions that will be "certified", but will allow malicious apps to quietly escalate their privileges and do their dirty work, but will block "uncertified" custom roms that actually have all the recent secuirity patches and give user full control over who has root access and how. Also, "bunch of XDA nerds" are the source of a lot of features that had their trial run in custom ROMs and then were adopted to the AOSP. Should I remind you of "The Oak and the Pig" fable? Alienate the developers bringing new ideas to the ecosystem - lose the competetive edge you had over other OSes saf1927 Actually, custom ROMs never really have the latest security patches despite what they claim since kernels aren't maintained and no proprietary blobs is updated anymore. If ROM developers were OEMs, they'd be violating their agreements with Google by bumping the patch level without actually addressing all the vulnerabilities. Dmitri Smirnov Well they patch the AOSP to the same level as latest official one and kernel - if it's possible to do so without breaking the compatibility with compiled blobs or at least on the level of latest official firmware. So in the end run it's at least as secure as the official firmware, often - much more so. saf1927 If you look at the security bulletin, most vulnerabilities come from proprietary drivers and require these to be updated. On a supported device, these are provided by the chip manufacturers to the OEMs, on an unsupported device they aren't updated anymore. A custom ROM can only fix userspace security issues. In the end, bumping the patch level without addressing all vulnerabilities in that patch gives a false sense of security to users. Dmitri Smirnov If anything, this is an argument for forcing OEMs to opensource their blobs. For some reason community is much better at releasing the fixes for what they can change (userspace), while OEMs generally stop caring as soon as device is out the door. saf1927 The problem goes beyond OEMs unfortunately. All the phones you can buy are assembled with off-the-shelf components that they buy from other manufacturers and it is them that provide the binary blobs to the OEMs. If they stop supporting components, the OEMs can't do anything. For the chip, it's companies like Qualcomm, Samsung, Mediatek etc. that need to support it with up-to-date drivers. Once they stop, the life-cycle of a phone comes to an end. trparky And that is probably one of many reason why Qualcomm is facing a nice fat anti-trust lawsuit. Serves them right. trparky That ain't ever going to happen. There's no way they're going to allow for their intellectual property to be open for all the world to see and have it cracked open. It would be corporate suicide since their competitors would be able to reverse engineer their stuff. Suicide_Note Never heard of "The Oak and the Pig" before. Could you tell me more? Seriously. Dmitri Smirnov http://www.aliceswonderland.eu/Alice-ska350-en.html Maxr1998 Ah, Lessing. Going to read the original version in a minute :) username_not_valid Thats a very generous view of the custom ROM community. It might be true of a few, very few devs, but most ROMs are unsupported garbage with serious security issues. Dmitri Smirnov Maybe so, but out of this cesspool of garbage CyanogenMod was born, which became LineageOS. I'd say their quality standard appeals me more than a lot of OEMs. username_not_valid Cyanogen and Lineage was what i had in mind.. Each to his own i guess. BAlGaInTl Yes and no. I run Lineage on my OnePlus One because Cyanogen OS is no longer supported. I can say with certainty that Lineage introduces stability issues that I have to deal with to be up to date. Wilton Daniel Pinto Ninna pooty bewarci Qwip Consider the bigger picture. Right now, users are being shuffled into a situation where they must restrict the control they have over their device if they want to be able to use Netflix (and presumably banking apps will follow soon). That may seem fine, and from some security perspective it is probably a good thing. How much control do you have over your _laptop_? How much do you want? Right now, we're blissfully able to install unsigned software on our computers (although various OSs will complain about it), but will that last? How long will it be before we can only open our banking interface on our laptop using a trusted, digitally signed browser on a machine that is using secure boot and can only run signed binaries? I can understand the direction that Netflix (and others) are coming from, and to them it may even make sense. The question is: what is the cost of ceding control over our devices/machines in order to be able to watch netflix, etc. trparky Yeah and that's why Windows is the virus filled cesspool that it is today. Windows 10 is slowly changing Windows to be an app store based ecosystem in which all apps will be sandboxed. It's coming to the desktop near you. saf1927 I hope Magisk (or other similar mods in the future) keep working, so to prevent this. Not a problem on my Pixel XL since I haven't rooted it, but on my Nexus 5 Magisk allows it to pass Safety Net even though it's running a custom ROM (7.1.2) and it's rooted. Hendrik Leppkes SafetyNets primary purpose is to secure devices for Android Pay, and when you deal with actual money transactions on your device, you really don't want any hack interfering with it - so I'm quite certain they'll do whatever they can to break hacks like this and ensure the security and integrity of the device. h4rr4r No, its primary purpose is to make the device trustworthy for others not the person who paid for it. This is how it makes it "secure" for android pay. You are a possible threat and this closes that. Suicide_Note It would seem that Google is erecting a wall around their garden, too. EowynCarter While Apple opens iOS more and more. YouNex According to the support/help page, a device is not certified if it stops getting Android updates. How fuck up is that ? I don't get it. My Moto X has always been on stock ROM, yet it's showing up as non certified. Yes it's rooted + system modifications, but at no point is it stated that root prevents it from being certified. Suicide_Note Really? You can't understand why your rooted/system modified device is non-certified? YouNex I know how to read, but this is vague https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/b6f710b8628f0e09ab73ba144c133a2c9b1fe1325b353ae7dc1636f2776b2ac0.png "Not secure" jonzey231 Root and/or unlocked bootloader = Not certified. YouNex It says nothing about root or bootloader https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/b6f710b8628f0e09ab73ba144c133a2c9b1fe1325b353ae7dc1636f2776b2ac0.png ast00 Can't wait until LastPass excludes root users... Fuck them. Adonis K. If they do, I'm cancelling my subscription... Naxx ENVY Fuck them and yet they haven't done anything yet ... #internetlogic Also i know right , crazy for a company that stores your passwords to make themselves more secure . ABSOLUTE CRAZY , RAGE RAGE RAGE Jordan Palmer I don't understand your reasoning or rationale for these two statements. ast00 The second part is related to Google. Sorry about the confusion. Believe it or not, most of us root users keep SELinux in it's Enforcing state. This means we are safe. Nothing gets root rights without us knowing. Our phones are just as safe if not safer than most stock phones. JATIN BANSAL SafetyNet test can be passed using Magisk Manager. I am using it and it works fine for me. Even in play store, my device is certified. May be this helps someone. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/3756499ff5876545740cd0e88e38961bb2c327d90fc43f5801f4bce5d802c990.png https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/44185f640490cb506a68a3414579bd345123f7d52ee2e11802d31d5141db11ae.png Nick Most people are worried about the future when the exploits that Magisk uses are patched and it continues to make it harder for people to get around this. JATIN BANSAL That's what I am also worried about. I just posted this for those who are already rooted and for now want to keep the root. My main purpose of rooting was to flash lineage OS. I think custom rom is the only way of staying updated to latest version of Android as google itself doesn't update their phones after 2 years (18 months I think) for reasons they have. I think if someone buys a flagship device which costs 700$+, it should have 3-4 years of full software update support. 😆😄 2 years of major OS version updates and 3 years of security patches. After 3 years, its time to buy a new phone cuz its so old anyway. trparky Says you! Windows 7 was released on July 22, 2009 and they still support it EIGHT YEARS LATER! And they plan on supporting it until the year 2020 which means it will be supported for a total of ELEVEN YEARS! If Microsoft can do it, Google can too!!! Does Microsoft suddenly say "Your machine is too old, go buy a new one"? No, they continue to give you Windows Updates for years later. We should also be demanding that the Android OEMs do so as well. A Samsung Note 5 has more than enough hardware in it to run Android 7 but no... we can't do that, we need to make money so we don't update them to force you to buy a new device. Lambdadelta Magisk...alright, thanks for the tip-off. I really must get it. TadMSTR Magisk doesn't always pass SafetyNet. I have some devices it fails on. However, several other devices it works just fine. Make sure you turn on the hide root option, it's off by default. Lambdadelta Well, I do have a problem, and that is my device is not able to download it directly from Google Play, so I have to get the APK from XDA. I dunno why this is the case for my phone though. Is it because it's a 4.4.4? Either way, I'll get the APK moved to my phone later tonight. Teodor Axel Johan Jönsson I have activated hide root option, and it passes SafetyNet, but in Google Play Store, it still shows uncertified. What app should I hide root from to get Play Store to show Certified? JATIN BANSAL As per XDA: Q: Safety Net fails after enabling MagiskHide A: Magisk can only hide Magisk core features, for Magisk modules it depends on what the module does. If your ROM itself is not able to pass SafetyNet, then there is nothing Magisk can help. Your best bet is 100% stock ROMs, because your phone manufacturer is forced to release a device passing CTS. Teodor Axel Johan Jönsson What in Magisk Hide did you check/how did you do it? Google Play Store? Or Play services? Because here it says uncertified :( JATIN BANSAL Just clear app data of play store. Now it will show your device certified Teodor Axel Johan Jönsson Thanks! Muzaffar I believe that root and custom rom makes android what it is now. This feels like betrayal for Android enthusiast. username_not_valid Well maybe in the very early days (maybe), but not any more. Rooted phones make up a tiny fraction of active devices. Muzaffar It's not about active devices. It's about how android develop together with community (well as i remember) I believe that those "rooted user" contribute many things that make android right now. I still remember status bar (and nav bar) color change was implemented on Kitkat before it becomes official on lollipop. Also, we can't forget how badly mobile active network bug happens in lollipop if it's not those "rooted user" who found out the fix via xposed. and i believe there are still more. trparky We can blame the OEMs for that kind of stuff because of things like locked bootloaders, eFuses, etc. username_not_valid Or we can blame ROM makers for it because they kept breaking the devices causing warranty claims. Naxx ENVY no offence but that's small thinking ... i'd say 90% of people on Android devices don't want or even know about root, heck it may even be 95% ... security is more of a concern, sure it annoys us geeks, but that's the 5% at most. Muzaffar And about half of android devices is left outdated. Not to mention bugs that unsolved on previous android. I'll pick a dumb phone instead, if android becomes a closed platform. trparky And truth be told that's why I have an iPhone. I simply got sick and tired of the lack of updates so I told myself I'm going to the iPhone and have been happy ever since. OK sure, it may not have all of the customization features that Android has but I can be guaranteed that I will get software and security updates on time, every time, regardless of my carrier of choice. refthemc I think you misread his comment, he's saying that root and custom roms got Android to where it is TODAY not saying that it is necessary TODAY. And I agree. trparky It pretty much comes down to this. Google is simply targeting a much larger piece of the pie. You can't blame them for trying to do what is necessary to protect not only the platform but the Android brand itself. Qwip Well, it isn't like there is anywhere else to go though, is it? Google can basically throw enthusiasts who have promoted and fostered android development under the bus - they don't need them any more. trparky Money trumps community. Always has, always will. username_not_valid Ad blocking was the last holdout reason to root for me, but even thats no longer a good reason with things like Adhell, Adguard etc I have no other reason to root now, custom ROMs are generally garbage, and bloat can usually be uninstalled or disabled, so its just not needed. Adonis K. custom ROMs have nothing to do with root... thevigilante Custom ROMs have uncertified flag in Play Store Mike Avellanosa Not all, though George Byers My Nexus 7 2013 is passing safteynet running Lineage unrooted. Wilton Daniel Pinto Let me guess, you have a Pixel. Or you wouldn't call custom ROMs bloated while the reality is other way round username_not_valid Wouldn't touch a Pixel actually. username_not_valid Should be noted that I didn't call custom ROMs bloated, I guess you misread it. Wilton Daniel Pinto Oh yeah, I misread it . My bad Zach Mauch This is going to cause the same problem I see in governments work with security. They will blindly block things like root and bootloader unlock regardless of if it poses any credible threat because it FEELS more secure. Blah!!!!!! Naxx ENVY it IS more secure, not just " feels" h4rr4r More secure for them, not for me the owner of the device. Besides, not even for them in the long term. An up to date ROM has many exploits patched that a two versions out of date and 12 months behind on security patches OTA has. Zach Mauch What I mean is they will apply restrictions because they easily can and it gives a warm fuzzy for them. They will do this regardless of the impact to the user. The analogy here is that in my job I am constantly unnecessary restrictions and bureaucracy that make doing my job much more difficult. For instance, we are disallowed from using remote desktop on standalone computer networks. It would make our job MUCH MUCH easier in many circumstances and save money on software as I could remote into my PC from anywhere in the building. Yet they deny us that and claim security. jonzey231 So this will force people to install apps from unauthorized sources, thus making the whole Android malware issue that much more prevalent. Great.. Suicide_Note Unless being held at gunpoint, no one is forced to install apps from unauthorized sources. That's a user's CHOICE. jonzey231 You know what I mean. Stop playing devil's advocate on everyone's posts. Eric Braun He's not incorrect. Kyle R Krcmaric "Stop providing an alternate viewpoint to my own." It's just comments. Anyway, I think Google also announced that even sideloaded apps will get scanned by their new Google Play Protect service, which may help nullify the risk of sideloading in the first place. d0x360 That's not an alternate viewpoint unless your view is "don't install any apps ever" There is no logical argument to defend this move by Google. None. username_not_valid Yes there is. Come content creators will not allow a provider to support a rooted or otherwise compromised device. Right or wrong in your eyes thats the reality, and in order for Android to be able to have such services Google have to do this. d0x360 What you said isn't an alternate viewpoint lol you are just repeating the reason Google is doing this which everyone agrees is a fact. As for this new comment...a rooted phone isn't compromised. Tell me...what would a rooted user do with Netflix that would make Netflix want to block them? Are they worried about people copying movies because if they think Android is the vector for that action they are idiots. All they are doing is making a problem by allowing bad actors to inject malware into a Netflix apk that could be installed by both root and unrooted users. Genius! Give me 1 good reason to block rooted phones from an app like oh I dunno, Mario run or whatever it's called. Any answers you give are false. Wanna know why? Hacked apks exist to allow cheating and they can be installed by anyone rooted or not. In fact I'd stake my life that your average unrooted user is installing more modified apk files to cheat in games or whatever than any rooted user. People who root are generally better educated about the Android eco system and do less dumb stuff. As for Netflix I cancelled my account on the day they did this and now I just use a friends account so they lost a subscriber due to this move and I rarely ever used the app. Sure 1 person closing an account that's existed since the day they opened isn't going to do much but I vote with my wallet and if a company does something I dislike then they simply don't get my money. The first person I asked gave me their login info and I made a profile. It's just like how I share my HBO subscription with someone else. Easy easy. username_not_valid See my previous comment. Its not for me to argue, the fact is content providers want it, fair or not, end of story, therefore its going to happen. The tiny number of rooters out there are meaningless to them, and Google. Netflix has to do this because the providers of its non-original content demand it. Its not Netflix fault, they either do it or lose shows. Losing large amounts of their content would affect their subscription base several orders of magnitude more than losing rooted users, who chances are, use the service on more than their phone or tablet anyway. d0x360 Once again I ask... what about a rooted device is dangerous to an app and also this is now a second question, what makes it compromised? BAlGaInTl Clearly you've made up your mind on the issue, but I'll give it a go. It isn't necessarily the root that is dangerous to an app or vice versa. The compromise comes from other apps/processes that can take advantage of root. If you don't understand that, then you don't understand what root really is. It has a lot of valuable uses, but it can also be dangerous. To address your previous statement, just because it rubs me the wrong way. So your "solution" was to cancel your Netflix account and then steal the content? So clearly, you aren't "actually" affected by the change, because you can still watch Netflix. You do realize that watching their content is also valuable to them and makes them money? If you want to boycott Netflix for their practices, then by all means do. Otherwise, it just comes across as hypocritical IMHO. d0x360 I don't believe I asked you. No I'm not stealing Netflix content, it's being paid for and Netflix has many times in the past encouraged account sharing. Of course they did so in the hopes you would join but they still allow it. I paid my Netflix dues. Day 1 4 disc member, then as soon as it was available I upgraded to the 4k 4 user package. It's not piracy either, I'm not recording or distributing the content. If Netflix wants to dick with me I'll dick with them. I never said this was permanent but I vote with my wallet. Vote cast. I also haven't used Netflix once since that day despite being able to. I've been using Amazon and Microsoft video where I own over 500 movies so you can stuff the whole theft argument. I've bought more content than most and that doesn't include my DVD, Blu-ray, and uhd Blu-ray collection which is well over 1400 movies and TV shows at this point. Your right...I've been rooting since the first Android phone but I totally don't understand the possibilities. My argument is simple. The overwhelming majority of root users don't mess with apps. To hell with that nonsense argument anyways. What is the danger to Netflix? Copying movies? Please...it's a million times easier to do it on a PC. Even windows xp can handle it without issue. Does Netflix and you I suppose really think root users are using the app to steal content? If so how? Show me one forum topic, one article, one modified Netflix apk that allows downloading and bypassing their drm. I'm begging you. Just 1. BAlGaInTl I reviewed the Netflix TOS, and I will agree that you are not stealing. I'll even remove the verbiage from my post. Netflix does not make any such stipulation. They speak only of the "Account Owner" and "Devices." I guess I just assumed that, and that's my bad. As I've said in other posts... It isn't all about Netflix. A large part of it is about their content. They really can't argue that point with providers. You either play by their rules, work to establish new rules, or choose not to carry them. Netflix wants to stay relevant on all platforms. That's the main danger to Netflix. In addition, I shouldn't have to give an example in the wild of an exploit. Just because it is difficult to find doesn't mean it doesn't exist. What if someone else writes an app that uses root to mine user account data from Netflix? Should Netflix not be worried about protecting user data? If that happens, who is responsible for the security and the bad press? Probably not Netflix, but they would certainly be impacted. I checked my app really quick (which is stuck on version 4 because I'm affected). Since Netflix keeps you logged in for convenience (that's spelled out in their terms), a quick look gives my full name, username, phone number, zip code, the brand of payment card, and the last 4 digits of that card. That's quite a bit of information that can easily be gathered by a piece of Malware. Now as I said... Netflix probably wouldn't be liable if a user was compromised because of root. It would certainly be a danger to their business however. Why should the be asked to take that risk? It seems to me that they are approaching this in a realistic manner, and rolling it out in a reasonable way. Would this affect the majority of root users? Probably not. By their nature, root users will find ways around it anyway. The problem is that the impact to Netflix from losing content and/or a compromised app is disproportionate the loss of blocking root users. It's simply a numbers game, and you can't blame Netflix for that. And you certainly can't blame Google who is trying to improve security. username_not_valid Thats not for me to decide, or argue, the fact is the content providers have decided that rooting is a risk to their copyrighted content, and as such services like Netflix, Amazon, and other streaming services must comply and lock out rooted devices. Passing safetynet and using Googles DRM framework is the easiest way to claim due diligence, so thats what they will do, and in order to keep Android competitive Google is providing the tools needed to make it possible. What I will argue though is that your notion that custom ROMs etc are more secure is unfounded. The best might well be, but there are hundreds of completely random and unchecked ROMs out there that could contain absolutely anything, you cant possibly claim that custom ROMs are inherently safer or more secure than OEM ROMs, outdated or not. jonzey231 So let's play this out: If someone takes the Netflix .apk and mods it with malware and then signs it, it will pass installation on the device. 1. User opens app. 2. App does whatever shitty thing it's designed to do while the user thinks they just got around the block. 3. The OS scans the app and warns the user it's been modified and they should uninstall it. 4. User thinks "Ha! I know and that's why it works!" 5. User keeps app until they get a call from Credit Karma that their identity was probably stolen but they don't know how. 6. Person spends 6 months fixing stolen identity. But still uses that app the whole time. Ultimately, that user is still going to be screwed. Would you or I make this mistake? No. Would your cousin's friend's dad because he had his son root so he could tether for free and overheard you guys talking about sideloading apps and googled how to do it? Yes. Randroid Problem is, even in your scenario, root has nothing to do with it. Someone who is not rooted could do the same thing. The only problem is, now MORE people who root are going to be *forced* to look for a modified apk because the official apk is not available from the Play Store. So in the end, it's causing more problems than it's fixing. Corbin Baxter Here's the thing about rooting: when you alter your devices software like that, then Google shouldn't be responsible for anything that comes afterwards for the user. This just helps discourage rooting, which can alter a new users perspective on Android, or make someone reconsider getting an Android device. someone755 For what it's worth, back in 2011/2010, many of us bought into Android *because* we could root. Imagine the possibilities of being in control of so much more of your system than with any mobile OS prior; We've spent hundreds (some, thousands) of dollars in this environment, on devices, apps, books etc. I understand this isn't how things stand nowadays, but root is still prevalent because of one issue that Google will not fix (or at least, won't until O+ is running on the majority of devices, but that'll take two years at the minimum), and those are updates and vendor apps (i.e. bloatware). If my phone is stuck on Lollipop I'm going to root it; I'll be able to mitigate the memory leak performance drops, and overall customize the device to fit my specific needs -- I've made quite a few friends (think ROM and kernel devs) because I just wanted to put a thermal engine better than Qualcomm's horrendous MPDecision into the kernel directly (i.e. I took the kernel source and modified it to fit my needs). What Google is trying to do here is, yes, discourage rooting, but instead of fixing the root cause (heh) behind why people root in the first place (that is, again, customizability and personal(ized) performance tuning, in large part to keep devices on older Android versions alive), root wouldn't be necessary. In the long run this *might* fix the symptom, but it most definitely will not help in fixing the cause. And that's because the cause is Google itself. As if apps like Snapchat blocking power users from their apps wasn't enough, now there's this -- If it becomes so common that even Google's own apps start to utilize the feature, I'll be gone to another mobile platform within a month. That might mean iOS, it might mean S60v3, I'll know that if (or rather, when) it happens. tl;dr: Google is putting a band-aid on a shotgun wound. Corbin Baxter I'm speaking mainly for new Android users. They don't feel as comfortable rooting. Doing this makes Android SEEM more like iOS. This doesn't MAKE Android like iOS. New users are comfortable with that. This is the same issue Microsoft had with Windows 8/8.1. Classic users, and Windows enthusiasts, hated someone changing the way they would use their computers. Microsoft introduced a different way of doing things, and to enthusiasts, it was bad, no matter how good it might be. Google's Project Treble should mostly fix the fragmentation problem, therefore giving Android users one less reason to root. To us enthusiasts, nothing can beat rooting, but it might not be the best solution to the problems Android has. Google seems intent on fixing the problems rooting tries to solve, but in a higher-quality and reliable way. No hard feelings😉 trparky They won't understand that, they're too blinded by their geek rose colored glasses. Corbin Baxter I don't expect everyone to understand, but I'll be happy if even a small handful understand what Google is doing here. Dmitri Smirnov > when you alter your devices software like that, then Google shouldn't be responsible for anything that comes afterwards for the user. As if right now Google or the OEMs are in any ways responsible for the malware or unpatched firmware vulnerabilities that stay this way for year. But yes, the users that root are the problem. Corbin Baxter For unrooted phones, yes Google and OEMs are very responsible. But after you root, Android loses most of its security and stability, and rooting is basically tinkering with core system files. Google doesn't have any control over what the user can or can't do after that. bekifft That wasn't even a devil's advocate, that was a straight up strawman. Frosted Butts Yes.. please tell me about all the Netflix alternatives i can install, that can legally stream from Netflix...... Right now, if i am rooted and want Netflix (a service i am paying for), i must go through 3rd party app stores to install the APK. There is no choice at all... R Firestone ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ Umm you have the choice to unroot your device. Maxr1998 ..which is a bad choice for many. d0x360 Yes you do except I rooted my device to make it MORE secure. Unrooting would make my device less secure than sideloading apps would. username_not_valid People can keep saying that, but the content providers have no way to know whether or not you have taken measures to secure your custom device, whereas if they go down this root they know its handled. BAlGaInTl "whereas if they go down this root they know its handled" I see what you did there. 😆😄 ...or just watch Netflix from Chrome! You could even do this from a Linux box with root! 😃 Suicide_Note Sure there is: unroot. Problem solved. neoKushan "I've solved this problem by creating 3 more problems - but it IS solved!" Eric Braun https://www.amazon.com/Netflix-Inc/dp/B005ZXWMUS Option C .. ?? h4rr4r A choice that is now more popular. dcdttu It's not so much about what a user chooses to do. It's about probability. The probability that sites are going to try to lure users into downloading malware-infected Netflix APKs from 3rd party sites is going to go up if you can't download it from a safe source in the first place. This is just like the fact that, if you don't give drug users a safe and clean place to shoot up, they're going to go do it somewhere else that's much more dangerous. Both of these scenarios are bad for society in general, no matter what the original intention was. kgptzac 1/10. Gotta try harder. Premsuraj How? Google Play Protect will still catch malicious apps makapav Yes but you're potentially making people venture through shady sites to get the APKs. Eric Braun Or to Amazons App store or Fdroid. The people going to shady sites are already going there, this isn't going to increase the traffic by any real amount. tehboogieman Are you sure that Google will continue allowing GPP for unlocked or rooted users going forward? Not to mention that it's not a silver bullet for 0days d0x360 It barely works as is. There are tons of apps that slip through every day. Krebs on security reports on them quite frequently. I don't trust Google's scanning of apps at all which is why I root. I can make my phone more secure and I can also image the device as often as I want so if something does happen it's fixed within 5 min. If I unroot then I lose the protection along with the backups. Premsuraj Custom ROMs and root can't protect from 0days either. And just out of curiosity how is root going to provide more security? If anything it makes the device less secure tehboogieman Nobody said root makes a device more secure. Blocking root users from downloading apps from the Play Store puts users at more risk since those users will be more inclined to sideload apps from sources that might not be as reliable as the Play Store. Premsuraj The only people who cares about this are the people who root. And those user's generally tend to be more knowledgeable about what kind of apps and app stores they can trust. ASYOUTHIA✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ And only <2% of users will do this to keep rooted. xxTheGoDxx Only the plus 50 - 100 Million users that have root: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=eu.chainfire.supersu ASYOUTHIA✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ You do realize that that's just downloads right? ...not active users. blindexecutioner I'm not mad. I continue to use things like magisk to help get around stuff like this. All this will do is encourage me to use unauthorized sources for offending apps if magisk ever stops working. There is a reason I use Android over iOS and it certainly isn't because the apps are better designed or whatever. brian. Magisk is a good way around this. However, I don't know how long this will last. I would think with security in mind and developers trying to monetize more, it will put pressure on Google to make SafetyNet get triggered much easier. Obviously, I don't have any way of knowing, but this could easily turn into a cat and mouse game more than it already is. Android Pay was first, other apps did it like Super Mario Run, which who cares, but now Netflix? Changes are coming, and it doesn't look good for the rooting community. D13H4RD2L1V3 I'm not sure if everyone gets why some of us went through the trouble of gaining SU access. Sure, maybe there's a few who went through all that trouble for nefarious purposes (and maybe that got regulatory bodies concerned to the point where Google even needed to consider this) but from my perspective at least, a lot of us gain Superuser access mainly to get features that we liked on other Android flavors, especially in the case of a build of Android that's very close to Google's vision. Such as the ability to hide the navbar at any time we wanted and also to gain theming support (which I feel should be added officially sooner rather than later because I absolutely hate how Google is making their already-bright UI even more eye-searing with even more white-colored elements, which also makes the benefits of OLED much less obvious). I wouldn't be as concerned if these features were pushed to AOSP soon, but as it stands, I feel that Google should probably think about making these features available soon. Marty Thank the bad apples for why you no longer have freedom. Jeremy ディリマ Would changing region firmware with Odin flag the SafetyNet check on Samsung mobiles? Soz if it's a stupid question a lot has changed since I last fiddled with Android Christopher Robert This was a long time coming. Once root user started using root to pirate software, and/or get around geo locks, instead of using it to add feature to their firmware or improve their devices performance, it was only a matter of time before it all got torn down. h4rr4r Get around geo locks? You mean have my device report the location I want it to report? Yeah, how terrible that I control what my computer does. dizel123 You still do. This doesn't affect that at all h4rr4r You said the justification for that was people using their devices for their own reasons in the way they liked. I was pointing out that this is a normal thing and not something that should be punished. Cuvis You don't need root to pirate. You never did. Marty Apple says, Thank you. h4rr4r Sounds like we need a new FREE platform. Maybe Amazon can use this to push their store. mxwp but will the Netflix from the Amazon App Store work on rooted phones? Curt RIP Root. I'm not moving from stock anymore, just cab with the hassle. Until there's a 'reliable' way to hide from Safety Net, I'll enjoy my Android Pay, banking apps and overall smoothness. (If it was up to me, I'd be rooted with Linage) h4rr4r IOS is the platform for you. That was the deal from the beginning. hp-fourtwenty magisk....giyf .y phone is rooted with lineage 14.1, and passes safetynet. problem solved! jcopernicus Fantastic news. Lawstorant All this butthurt for what? You all sound like Magisk doesn't exist. Dave Hamilton Lets take Apple and there closed source. Lets take Google and there open source, the freedom to do and change as you please to make the device yours. No two devices have to be the same. Lets get 115 million android users, and then start deciding you no longer have this choice and freedom to do what you want! When something gets better and better, its only a matter of time before all the things you love are removed and comersilised Eric Braun You still have the option to do what you want. However like everything there are reactions for every action. Want to root or unlock your device? Sure, however there may be a few apps that no longer appear in the playstore. May want to have a backup like Amazon App Store or something similar ready. No one is stopping you, feel free to do as you please. tehboogieman Man, if I have to choose between having a device with root or a device with apps that use day to day, the iPhone goes from a 1% chance of being my daily driver to about 50% There are still a lot that can Android can do that iOS can't, but if I'm living in a walled garden the iPhone is looking pretty attractive. 5+ years of official OS support, solid retail network for quick service or hardware exchanges. The Play Store is my main source of apps that I know are vetted and generally safe. I have no desire to manage app updates manually. There is always a chance that someone will build and maintain an appstore that will have all root blocked apps (maybe the future of APKMirror?). If not it might be the death of Android for users like me Eric Braun Even without all of this I would use an APKMirror App that allowed for updating of apps automatically. dizel123 Google gives app developers more control over their apps. Whiny entitled internet crybabies go on the internet and whine and cry. Aka...Thursday neoKushan Alternatively: Google restricts users from using their device, which they own, how they see fit. dizel123 Except Google isn't restricting anyone from doing anything. But being 100% wrong has never stopped anyone in the internet NubCake being an asshole (in your case) hasn't stopped anyone from commenting eather it seems. dizel123 I can admit to being an asshole. But I'm also right so it's all good. neoKushan It's certainly not stopping you. dizel123 I haven't experienced it so of course it's not stopping me trparky You may own the hardware but you don't own the software, you only have a license to use it. Csöpi Thats so greate. I have a stock oneplus one and for some strange reasons i was failing the test beforhand, but now its all green. Still cant update the netflix app hence chromecast isnt working either anymore. Not really happy. JC If there's a will there's a way. brian. If more developers get on board with this, I can't see why I would switch to Android. I've always been curious about new Android phones, bought a bunch and rooted them all if I could. This is not good for a person like me. d0x360 If Google keeps this up and app devs include the api to block rooted phones then my days using Android will be over and Google will have lost a user who's been there since the g1. I don't know what I'd switch to... probably windows mobile because I'm not a fan of apple whatsoever. It's really a shame because if I had to guess I'd say 99.99% of people who root do so for either the added security and or customized experiences. For example I use root to modify my status bar and quick panel as well as firewall my apps and use adaway and yes Google I do whitelist sites that aren't obnoxious with their ads. John Doe All the more reason for the APK mirror appstore LoL Jan-Lk Else Yeah Google want's us to buy tooooo expensive phones to just get the latest Android, because cheap phones suck at updates and so they need to be flashed and rooted... trparky But if the community raises holy hell with the OEMs then maybe it will be corrected. There's no damn reason why a three year old device can't be updated when an eight year old Windows 7 machine is still receiving Windows Updates. McStagger WHY DOES NETFLIX CARE IF THE PHONE IS ROOTED?!?!?!?! mxwp Netflix does not care, but the content creators that make the stuff you see on Netflix do care. They care because they are idiots who think it is easier to pirate from rooted phones. bekifft Again, Google becomes more and more restrictive. I switched from iPhone because the screens were too small, and Google was far less restrictive. Both of those issues are now resolved, and Google's upped the price of their device to match Apple. May as well switch back to iPhone, Google seems to support it just as much as Android anyway. Luxferro Except it's not just rooted users! Any device with an unlocked bootloader. hp-fourtwenty Your comment sucks for misinforming users about what safetynet is....has NOTHING to do with unlocked bootloaders. Luxferro Sure it does. My Nexus 6P only has an unlocked bootloader, and Netflix disappeared from the play store after the last update. And I'm not the only one, so I suggest you do some reading. TechGuy22 more reason for me to pirate hey, have at it Matías Duarte I hope Netflix does the same with Jailbroken iOS devices. Why they do this btw? To prevent people recording their movies? You can do that with Windows.. Knowledgeborn Allah In all honesty, that'll probably never happen. Jailbreaking iOS opens the doors to a lot of customization on an iPhone, but the security issues are often minimal (with the exception being not having the latest software version). Jailbreaking is pretty much filtered through the Cydia platform. You don't have access to the entire system with a jailbreak. Rooting is completely different, because you can completely reshape the core OS. fbl Note : I don't work for Netflix so I can't comment for them. Possible causes : - the right holders might be pushing for this. I work on roughly the same product area and we don't implement DRM because we like them, we implement them because we contractually have to. -Netflix is tired of getting low notes because of crashes coming by shitty hacks in custom roms. Zach Mauch Anyone know how chromebooks will be affected by this? Will dev mode being enabled cause you to fail SafetyNet Checks? That is currently the only way to install apks on Chromebooks. Branko But Android AOSP!11 -Google 2011 How the times how changed. Wayne Randall ALT arguement, because I don't have time to read every comment... This doesn't limit me and my rooted N6P at all, this move limits how much money they (the devs and Google) are going to make. I can't buy it (the app or coins, or special characters, or bonus content, w/e) if I can't see it. Plain and simple. The important apps will still be there. No app is worth unroot. Block Project Fi from root though... weeeellll. I guess I'd unroot for that. mxwp yeah, only Netflix, banks, and big names will use these blocks. i am guessing most devs want as much exposure as possible. PVL_93_RU Google is actively trying to kill the modding community. Not the Custom ROM makers, but people who root and install Xposed. All because they compromise the security for Android Pay I fear the day root and Xposed apps start disappearing from the Play Store trparky If it comes to security vs being open, security will always win (or at least should always win). Eric Koop I had my Shaw Gateway app update yesterday and they changed it so it doesn't work if rooted. So I had to uninstall and find an APK online of an older version. Now it's just a matter of time before I forget and re-install the update. What a pain... disqus_em5YfkbWdk Well this would certainly get me to cancel Netflix. My personal Plex server is far better than Netflix could ever be anyway. Vivek Rameses Becoming apple more and more every day. Disgusting. Knowledgeborn Allah Android is starting to look more and more like iOS with each update... ¯_(ツ)_/¯ trparky Open platforms rarely stay open once the Benjamins start rolling in. hp-fourtwenty Go ahead and block me...I'll just pirate your app. Play nice and so will I. Start poking me and I'll poke back by never giving you another penny. App devs can't beat XDA devs. It's not going to happen. My unlocked, rooted, rommed and modded device still passes safety net. The day that stops, so does the flow of money leaving my hands on the play store. Luxferro Lay off the sodas.... UniBroW Question, can those of you without access to Netflix on Google play, can it be installed from the Amazon App Store? Stanley C. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/dd381b7e8a39df74c4725712a0db906098c965e9ee4194b6e01e020fd69ee566.png Thats how magisk is made... Magic! Marti Abernathey Yawn. I've got a rooted device and just installed Netflix... because? Magisk. As soon as they made this choice I cancelled. Not because I can't get around it, but because they make me do that. mrjayviper even on a non-rooted LOS mis 5s+, I cannot install Netflix. unlocking the bootloader already tripped safety. And I don't want to root. The features available in non-rooted LOS is enough for me. Teh BuG No. Bueno. TedPhillips Sigh. What's the over-under on this becoming pervasive in the play store... MicroG / Fdroid I'm coming soon. World needs a solid single alternative gcm replacement to catch on. TedPhillips As far as the potential for support overhead, being rooted is generally less than the pain coming from the Xposed/magisk crowd. You need to be actively interfering with an app via root vs code being injected into low levels of the framework that everything uses. TedPhillips I think the best outcome could be that Google opens up their process for little guys to certify there own rom builds, ala let's encrypt lowering friction on getting ssl setup. AOSP should not be a functionally useless base implementation for I'm roms, but something you can use in​ practice. TedPhillips Hey guys, don't worry. Google says Android is for everyone. https://www.android.com/everyone/ That includes AOSP developers too, right? That website seems to tread the line pretty carefully, ala 'no one is forcing you use Google play' but Hiroshi's quote seems like it comes with a grain of salt since he owns Play. I'd love to see AP interview him about this. qkjDlav As an app developer for a large app used globally, the two biggest time wasters in a developer's life are a) debugging device specific issues (HTC, Samsung, etc) and b) crash logs with Xposed in the stack trace. Developers are tired of having to sit around with device farms at their desks just to make sure new features and changes work with each quirky variant of Android that manufacturers want to deploy, and custom roms do make it worse. Enthusiasts are welcome to customize their own versions of Android and sideload apps, but we don't want to see crashlogs in the Developer Console from rooted/custom ROM users. And companies probably don't want to keep paying us to debug issues that only a small minority of users will see. Lê Nguyên Chương Most stupid thing I've ever heard in my life.

Android Studio 3.0 brings Kotlin support and a ton of new debugging tools Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/05/18 1:45pm PDTMay 18, 2017 12 Plus 1 on G+ 65 Share on Facebook 71 Share on Twitter Total Shares148 Android O Android OS Android Things Android Wear Development Google News Videos Article Contents 1 Languages 2 New targets and platforms 3 Design and build 4 Debugging 5 Etc. Android Studio 3.0 seems to be living up to that major version change the 3.0 number implies. There are many useful new tools for developers, especially when it comes to improving and easing the burden of debugging. There are also some changes that will require advanced preparation to keep your apps and workflow functioning before things break. We have many things to cover, so let's dive in. Languages To start, 3.0 brings with it support for Kotlin, which we also covered here, so you don't need to install anything extra to be able to play around with the new language support. All the interested need to do is jump forward into 3.0 via the Canary channel and enable it, either in their next app via the new project wizard, or via the language selector when adding new activities to an existing project. There is also a conversion tool for bringing your Java classes over to Kotlin. It's not going to be magic, but it should help with porting stuff over. In other language-related news for the platform, we also get the new desugar bytecode transformations from javac in the default toolchain. This can replace the now deprecated Jack and Retrolambda for bringing some convenient Java 8 features into Android Studio like lambdas, method references, default and static interface methods, and try-with-resources. New targets and platforms The new Android Instant Apps SDK, recently opened for all to use, also requires Android Studio 3.0. So even if you aren't interested in Kotlin, you'll have to jump into canary channel if you are looking forward to playing with that. IntelliJ IDEA is still the base for Android Studio, and the change to 3.0 updates things to the 2017.1 branch. That means you get all the same new features from that version like semantic highlighting, Java 8 refactoring, enhanced version control search, and smart conflict resolution. New layout and graphical resource tools are also present in the form of adaptive icon support and expanded font support to include making and previewing XML and binary fonts, as well as the ability to download from Google Fonts in the Layout Editor. Android Things support is now also present in the IDE via a convenient new set of templates in associated wizards, so the barrier to entry for development on that platform is going to be much lower.   Design and build The new Android Studio brings with it a new Gradle plugin that is all about speeding up your build process and increasing the granularity of dependencies. This has also resulted in changes in the DSL for Gradle that broke the old API in Android Studio. If you depended on them, you might have to check and see what effect that has on you and, if necessary, migrate things over at some point. Google is also now self-distributing its build artifacts in its aptly named Google's Maven Repo, so setting up continuous integration servers for your projects will be a bit easier. Both the Layout Editor and Layout Inspector are seeing changes in 3.0, to better help with improving your app UI and overall user experience. There are new constraints like chains, barriers, and groups for easing chain creation and making sure things look the way you want on more devices and in more situations. There is also a new error panel for layout issues to let you know if you might be missing any constraints that could otherwise mess with your UI. Debugging Debugging seems to have been given a big focus with the updated tools in Android Studio 3.0. For one, the new Android Profiler. As we mentioned in the previous post, it gives developers a means of visually identifying CPU, Memory, and Network usage spikes that might correspond to app events, which are also labeled on the graph. For non-O based emulator images or devices, you have to enable advanced profiling in the run configuration window to see all the new features. The resolution also increases at a fine level for finding the precise cause of jank on all of the three graphs. For CPU usage that means you can view things down to checking thread usage and method traces. With the RAM use graph, you get more precise memory allocation, the ability to track object allocations, and you can dive into heap dumps. Network info gives you requests and responses for headers and payloads done in HTTP or via supported clients like Volley and OkHttp. The Android Studio native debugger also now works for APKs made in game toolkits like like Unity, APKs with C/C++ code, and APKs from other IDEs. The APK analyzer in Android Studio has been updated to work with Instant App zips. The text viewer also has an updated UI with more filter and search options, and can also now open shrunk and obfuscated code via ProGuard mapping files as well as create ProGuard keep rules. Etc.   There are also smaller features in the update that will improve the overall quality of life for developers. The Device File Explorer is, as you'd guess, a new way to explore file systems on emulators or connected devices in the IDE, so you don't have to use ADB for that. The emulator will also have full OpenGL ES 3.0 support, WiFi network emulation, a bug reporter, and images will include the full Play Store. The latter will cut down prep time before testing and will make updating play services or other apps required easier. The new images are signed, though, so you won't be able to get root in them. Android Wear developers will also be able to use rotary input controls in their apps, at least on devices that have crowns that feature rotational input. There are a lot of SDK updates you'll need to use the new tools, and I'll toss those in a note below so you can double check that you are up to date if you run into any issues. Canary and Dev Channel Updates SDK Platform O r2* Build-tools 26.0.0-rc2 Platform-Tools 26.0.0-rc2 Emulator 26.1.0 Lldb-3.0.3970975 Android O Google API's x86 System Images r3 Android TV x86 O System Image r2 Android O Play x86 Play System Images r3 O Wear System Image r2 NDK r15 beta 2 Android Instant Apps 1.0 Google Repository Updates Stable Channel Updates Platform-tools 25.0.6 The new O Developer Preview image is also available for download. You can, therefore, use these new features in Android Studio 3.0 on the newest version of Android in the emulator. Between the Canary channel and Developer Beta, I would expect bugs to multiply on bugs, but you can thankfully have both the old stable and new canary versions installed alongside one another. Either way, some of the new changes with things like Gradle will require that you update your stuff at some point. It might be worth backing things up and updating your Gradle plugin just to test if anything breaks.

The Actions on Google platform spreads to phones, with new payment support and a ton of new features Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/05/17 11:21am PDTMay 17, 2017 8 Plus 1 on G+ 44 Share on Facebook 33 Share on Twitter Total Shares85 Applications Google Google Home News Google has announced that its Actions on Google platform will be coming to the Assistant on iOS and Android. Previously the platform was just available on Google Home, but soon it will work on all your phone, too. This change significantly expands the number of third party services and tools you can access on your phone via Assistant. It even works across devices, so you can pick up your phone and continue your action there if you have to run away for a bit. There are even new tools for developers, as the platform is tied with a new payments API. You might remember the huge number of apps and features that Home supported which the Assistant did not. Well, this change will bring most of those over as well as bring a few new ones. Among my favorite highlights are the ability to create reminders, make calls via your phone over your Google Home, use a ton of new media platforms, and your Chromecast will now provide information and feedback to requests of the Assistant, too. The new ability for the Assistant to make payments could also be pretty dangerous to my diet. All the little stuff you could do with services like Quora or Philips' Hue platform on Google's Home can also be done on your phone, now. It's been a long wait, but my sigh of convenience is tremendous. There will also be support for new streaming services like Netflix, Deezer, and HBO NOW, CBS, and HGTV in the future.  There are also new smart home partners for the platform, so presumably you'll be able to make your home an even smarter place, too. I was always super envious of all the extra stuff Home got that my phone didn't via the Assistant. Now it's an even playing field for those like me that have yet to decide on which personal home assistant ecosystem to use. The new payment system will also make my frivolous purchases that much easier. If only I could yell at my phone to order Foodler.

 YOUR E-MAIL VERIFICATION CODE Google CEO Sundar Pichai talking about the new features of Google at the I/O 2017 developer conference. At the I/O 2017 developer conference, Google announced updates that will enable Android phones to identify what they see with the Lens app Developing solutions for different platforms, from smartphones to wearable devices, from voice assistants to artificial intelligence, Google has announced new updates at its I/O 2017 event, which brought together some 7,000 software developers. Having announced its new Android operating system "Google Android O" for smartphones, the company would enable every application to smarten up with the use of artificial intelligence. Google CEO Sundar Pichai noted that people are trying to solve many complicated problems in their everyday lives, saying, "Google Android platform has exceeded over 2 billion active users per month. YouTube has not just reached 1 billion users, but also turned in to a screen on which 1 billion hours of videos are viewed every day. Every day, people travel a total distance of one billion kilometers thanks to Google Maps. 500 million users are using Google Photos app for their photos." Eyes on YouTube Google has given the "O" code name to the Android platform it updates every year. While the new operating system is available as beta, smart applications can be used within themselves. For example, Google translation service integrates into chat applications, while the address in a text message is used as a transition to a new application at the moment of a phone call or any kind of information. Besides, security software and battery optimization are standard in the new operating system. All applications from Google Maps to voice assistant, from Gmail to photo editing software will all now smarten up with the touch of artificial intelligence technology. The Google Lens app will people identify everything seen through the phone's camera. With the security software that comes as standard on Android O, Google also aims to become a more secure platform. In the meantime, it also made Google Assistant available on iOS platforms such as the iPhone and iPad. While more than a billion hours of videos are viewed on YouTube, 360-degree videos are also being watched. For those who create video content, live broadcasts have begun to color with chat environments such as Super Chat. Besides, 360-degree videos will start to be watched on big-screen TVs. Target 3 billion android devices Google's accessible smartphone strategy was initially unsuccessful, except for the Android One platform in Turkey. The company will put Android One platform's fourth generation phone General Mobile GM6 on sale in Turkey at the end of the month. Google plans to launch the accessible phone program in India, Africa, and the U.S. to increase the number of Android apps from 2 billion to 3 billion with the help of Android Go platform. The first device is expected to hit the market in 2018. In fact, Google wants to accelerate the update of the new operating system using this method. The market is growing not only for smartphones but also for devices that are connected to the internet such as Google Home, daydream and smart watch with smart applications. Weaknesses, strengths of Google and Apple On average Apple users spend more on apps. While Android users spend $27 on applications, iOS users spend $75 on average. Android is stronger and has more applications in emerging markets like Turkey, China, and Brazil. It also generates more income. Apple, which stands out with brand power and different experiences, has strong brand perception and high consumer loyalty in markets like the U.S., Japan and the U.K. Android, on the other hand, is getting stronger in markets such as France, Germany, Spain, Italy and the U.K. Photos are instantly shared With over 500 million users, the Google Photos app has intelligent sharing capabilities. Photos are saved instantly on the accounts of those you have just photographed. You can keep photos in a shared library with your best friends and they can download the photos they like. The assistant is always with you The Google Assistant app is starting to use artificial intelligence more often by improving mutual communication. Although not yet supported in Turkish, Google Assistant is becoming more and more popular on devices with Google Home voice command capabilities. Google Lens: The eye that identifies When Google Lens app sees a restaurant or a Wi-Fi cipher, it immediately suggests the next step to the user. For example, the camera immediately displays the information about the restaurant it sees or helps to identify an object. Platforms compete for developers As smartphones become indispensable parts of our lives, they continue to acquire new talents. While platform companies such as Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and Apple are growing their own ecosystems, they try to accommodate the software developers even more. They are trying to integrate new technologies such as artificial intelligence, cloud, machine learning and large data into their own platforms. Thus, devices are managed with voice commands and have easy-to-use interfaces, thanks to software developers. Although the battery problem cannot be solved completely, the ability to solve such vital tasks is admirable.

At I/O 2017, they revealed an emulator that will allow local development without the need for an actual Chrome OS device. Nintendo Switch While the Friday afternoon session was primarily devoted to Chromebooks, Google notes that there are many “large screen devices,” citing the Lenovo Yoga Book and Samsung DeX for the Galaxy S8 and S8+. Going through the best practices for optimizing apps for large screens, Google is further aiding developers by providing a local Chromebook emulator to encourage optimizing for the new platform. Google notes that most apps will already work on a larger form factor, but that developers would do well to optimize the experience and plan for “huge screens.” Namely, apps should move to API level 24 or later to take advantage of the latest windowing features. This Chromebook emulator is coming very soon, with developers able to sign-up now for early access. They note that the tool is still in beta and under “heavy development.” Abner Li @technacity Is interested in the minutiae of Google and Alphabet.

Available for download via GitHub (it’s open source), once the app is installed on your Mac, it lives in the top menu bar right alongside Siri. Awesomely enough, a simple double tap of the Command key will prompt Google Assistant to wake up, then you can speak your command. After downloading it to my own MacBook Pro, I can confirm this appears to be the real deal. Once downloaded, log into your Google account (Disclaimer: always be wary when granting permissions to 3rd-party apps), then get to using it. It’s very slick, but do note, the developer currently has it listed as a 0.2 beta, so you may find some bugs. Developers, we love you. Download Here Cheers Vansh!

Apparently Audi has bestowed the Q8 Sport, revealed at the Geneva show, with an infotainment system based on Google's Android operating system, rather than a proprietary one. The company revealed the system at the Google I/O conference. The system is controlled via the Q8 Sport's touchscreen, and should function like a normal Audi infotainment system. However, this one comes with applications such as Google Play Music, Google Assistant, and Google Maps built-in. Audi also says that running an infotainment system on Android should make it easier for applications and updates to be developed for the automotive version, since it won't require developers to learn to code for a single car line's completely unique and different operating system. Unlike Volvo, though, Audi doesn't have a timeline for introducing Android infotainment systems. The Swedish company announced that its Android-based system will be in production cars within the next two years.

Now, they’re beating us at something as fundamental as looking at things. Case in point: Google CEO Sundar Pichai revealed at the company’s Google I/O developer conference in Mountain View this week that his company’s computers have surpassed humans at recognizing objects in images. That’s why users of Google’s mobile software will soon be able to point their phone camera at a flower, and instantly get Google’s assistant to look up the name of the plant. Point it at a restaurant, and get reviews of it. Or — and this got the most cheers out of Pichai’s geeky audience at Google I/O — point it at the password sticker on the back of a router, and have their phone use that data to log into the Wifi network. “We are clearly at an inflection point with vision,” Pichai said. Google’s CEO talked about this inflection point as part of a bigger transition for his company, and the world of technology in general. Google began its life a web search engine, focused on making computers and the internet easier to use. Then came mobile, and Google had to adapt. “Mobile made us reimagine every product we were working on,” said Pichai. Related Google’s Plan to Make Voice Control Work When All Devices Have Microphones Now, a new generation of devices and services — including voice-activated speakers like Amazon Alexa and Google Home, but also phone cameras and virtual and augmented reality headsets — are redefining everything once more. “Computing is evolving again,” he said. “We now have voice and vision as two new important modalities for computing.” Google announced its new image-recognition efforts Wednesday under a new project name, Google Lens. Pichai said that Lens-powered technology will first come to Google Assistant and Google Photos in the coming months, and find its way to additional Google products in the future. Accident or not, the Lens name clearly sets Google’s image-recognition efforts apart from Snapchat’s and Facebook’s. Both companies are also investing massively into artificial intelligence and image recognition — but the way these efforts are reaching consumers couldn’t be different. Snapchat’s lenses, and Facebook’s filters, allow consumers to add rainbow-puking unicorns and animated birthday cakes to their photos and videos. Admittedly silly stuff, but Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg made a convincing case during his company’s recent f8 developer conference arguing that there is more to it. Facebook in particular has been using advanced image-recognition technologies powered by artificial intelligence to recognize and isolate objects in those pictures.  And while consumers post, share and remix billions of silly photos, Facebook’s algorithms are busy crunching in the background, using them as training data to get better at image recognition and augmented reality. Zuckerberg said that his audience was looking to use phone cameras and visual effects to make augmented reality mainstream. “We are going to make the camera the first augmented-reality platform,” Zuckerberg said. Google has no rainbow-puking unicorns. It clearly is working on the same problems, and also loves to collect data and train its algorithms, but does so with a Google-ish twist. Instead of being fun, it wants to be useful — even if that means that pundits call it boring. The company is also busy chipping away on other parts of the problem, including voice recognition — an area that Facebook has thus far eschewed. And there are clear areas of overlap between advancements at Facebook, Google and other companies. The most obvious example for this is virtual reality, where Google will soon compete even more aggressively with Facebook’s Oculus by launching a standalone VR headset. But Google is also playing in a league of its own, something that became evident when Pichai announced that the company is now building servers and data centers focused on artificial intelligence that are being made available to other companies as part of its Google Cloud platform. And if that wasn’t enough, Google is even working with phone makers to bring chips optimized for artificial intelligence to future Android phones. These kinds of chips will make it possible for future phones to get even better at voice and object recognition, and enable all kinds of far-out augmented and mixed-reality applications. You know, things that make rainbow-puking unicorns seem outright boring.

The artificially intelligent, augmented reality feature seemed to generate the most interest at Google’s developer conference that wrapped up Friday. Of all announcements, it best encapsulated what Google’s transition to an “AI first” company means. Google CEO Sundar Pichai underscored the tool as a key reflection of Google’s direction, highlighting it in his Google I/O keynote as an example of Google being at an "inflection point with vision.” "All of Google was built because we started understanding text and web pages. So the fact that computers can understand images and videos has profound implications for our core mission," he said in his introduction of Lens. The feature is first being added to Google Photos and the personalized AI software Assistant, which is available on an increasing number of devices. Lens uses machine learning to examine photos viewed through your phone’s camera, or on saved photos on your phone, and can use the images to complete tasks. A few things Lens can do: Tell you what species a flower is just by viewing the flower through your phone’s camera; Read a complicated Wi-Fi password through your phone’s camera and automatically log you into the network; Offer you reviews and other information about the restaurant or retail store across the street, by you just flashing your camera over the physical place. Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images Lens was a favorite of several Google I/O attendees for its clear utility. It’s the kind of feature that could make the apps that contain it more uniquely useful. One developer commented to me it was “the first time AI is more than a gimmick.” Typing a question into Assistant, for example, can feel like just using Google Search in a separate window. Add this new computer vision capability, though, and you have something a browser search box can’t do. Lens brings Google’s use of AI into the physical world. It effectively acts as a search box, and shows Google’s adaption to the move amongst younger users toward visual media. That preference has made social network Snap a magnet for younger users, who prefer to communicate with pictures over text. Lens affirms a consistency of focus for Google. Here is augmented reality at work doing exactly what people know Google can do, which is retrieve information from the web. But in considering how this new visual search option may play out, compare it to voice search, which for now often returns read-outs of whatever would appear at the top of search, sometimes resulting in answers that are inaccurate, offensive or lacking in context. Google also cleverly incorporated Lens into one of the company’s most-used apps, Photos, which has gained half a billion users in the two years since its launch. The incorporation could help Google become more essential to mobile users by making its mobile apps more essential. That means Google will have a place on users’ phones even if its own hardware like the Pixel phone fails to catch on. Pichai said in his founders’ letter a year ago that part of this shift to being an AI first company meant computing would be less device-centric. Lens is an example of being less device-centric, on mobile. The technology behind Lens is essentially nothing new, and that also tells us something about where Google is going. This is not to say that Google is done coming up with new technologies, but that there are a lot of capabilities the company is still putting together into useful products.

It offers a variety of examples of the types of actions it can accomplish, along with additional info should you tap on one.

Google seems to focus on sharing and machine learning in this latest round of updates and we want to talk a bit about those new features. One of them is called Suggested Sharing. When you upload new photos, machine learning will actively search for people you can share photos with. And when you share it with someone, that person will also get suggestions who he can share the photos with. Anyone can be invited to see the photos, even if they don’t have the Google Photos app and they can even invite others to share it with. Aside from that, you can now have Share Libraries, where you can give your family and friends access to an entire photo library and let anyone share photos when they want. While similar to shared photo albums, the photos are still integrated into your own camera roll. You can search through these photos without having to navigate through a specific photo album. And it even keeps out any extra, non-interesting photos. Google is also introducing Google Lens in the coming months. What it does is it helps you identify what’s in the photo you took (for example, a flower) and help you edit on-the-go and get rid of obstructions in a picture. The company is also be offering photo books which come in either soft or hard cover. It’ll have 20 pages by default and have 40 of the best photos. The 7-inch soft cover version goes for US$9.99, while the hard cover goes for $19.99. Additional pages will cost $0.35 for the soft cover and $0.65 for the hard cover. It’s available now on Google Photo’s site and is said to be coming to Android and iOS soon.

Liliputing LPX Show Mini PCs Reviews Deals Shop About Contact us Advertise on Liliputing About Liliputing Privacy Statement Google introduces Daydream 2.0 Euphrates for phones, standalone VR headsets 05/18/2017 at 1:09 PM by Brad Linder 3 Comments About half a year after the launch of Google’s Daydream View, it’s still the only headset compatible with Google’s Daydream virtual reality platform. But the company says there are currently 8 phones with Daydream support, and several more on the way including upcoming models from LG, Asus, and Motorola. Samsung’s Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8 Plus will also add Daydream support through a software update coming this summer. This week Google also announced that it’s adding support for standalone headsets that don’t require a smartphone at all. Google and qualcomm developed a reference design, and Lenovo and HTC are two of the first companies preparing to launch standalone Daydream headsets. When they do launch, they’ll run a new version of Google’s Daydream software, which will also be coming to phones. Daydream 2.0 is codenamed Euphrates, and it includes a couple of nifty new features. The home screen has been tweaked a bit with a new content guide, but there’s also a new dashboard that you can bring up from within any app in order to view notifications and other menu items. Google has also added Cast support, allowing you to stream what you’re seeing to a Chromecast-enabled TV in real-time. So if you’re playing a game or exploring a virtual environment with a headset, anyone sitting nearby can watch you progress on the big screen (and in 2D). There’s also now support for sharing screenshots and video captured from a Daydream session. Daydream is also getting a full version of the Chrome web browser that allows you to navigate with a Daydream controller. In addition to surfing the web, this lets you interact with virtual reality apps that use WebVR, and watch videos in full-screen mode. Chrome for Android will be compatible with Daydream later this year. Google says it’s also adding support for web augmented reality as well as virtual reality experiences. Developers will be able to integrated experiences using the tools available in a new experimental version of Chromium that’s available from Github. A new YouTube VR app is also in the works, with support for watching videos simultaneously as other users, and engaging with those co-watchers via chat tools and avatars. While Google only highlighted a few new features in Daydream 2.0 Euphrates during a session at the Google IO developer conference, the company did show a a slide with a bunch of other under-the-hood changes coming with Daydream 2.0, including: Support for Qualcomm Snapdraagon 835 and ARM Mali-G71 Vulkan graphics API support Multi-process VR compositor Unity and Unreal audio support Auto magnetometer calibration and auto gyroscope drift correction Google also teased a new tool called Seurat that the company says helps make complex 3D environments render quickly on a phone. There aren’t many details about how it works yet, but the company says it’s already worked with ILMxLAB to bring scenes from Star Wars Rogue One to a mobile headset experience.

Liliputing LPX Show Mini PCs Reviews Deals Shop About Contact us Advertise on Liliputing About Liliputing Privacy Statement Standalone Daydream VR headsets feature “Worldsense” position tracking 05/18/2017 at 3:13 PM by Brad Linder 3 Comments Lenovo and HTC plan to launch some of the first standalone Daydream VR headsets later this year, and Google has developed a reference platform with Qualcomm that will let other companies bring their own to market. Since these devices don’t use your phone or a computer, all you have to do is put on the headset to start a virtual reality session. There’s nothing to set up, and no wires to plug in (or trip over). While 1st-gen Daydream systems allowed you to look around a room, Daydream 2.0 will work with standalone headsets to offer 6-degrees of freedom position tracking, which means you can move up down, left right, or forward and backward. But at the Google IO conference, Google representatives are explaining to developers that they may need to do things a bit differently when creating apps for the new standalone headsets. Existing Daydream-compatible apps will work on the new headsets. But since there’s no phone that you can remove to complete some actions on a touchscreen, Google says developers need to create VR-friendly experiences for doing things like signing into an account or updating payment information. Google also notes that many people will likely be using Daydream standalone headsets in relatively tight spaces. So the company does not encourage developers to create apps that encourage people to actually walk around. Instead, the idea is to let people sit or stand, but also to learn and shift their balance for a more realistic experience. For example, the company showed off a dodgeball demo game, where you lean out of the way of incoming balls. Among other things, Google encourages use of “teleportation” as an alternative to walking. You can move through virtual worlds with the use of a Daydream motion controller by pointing at the space where you want to be and clicking to teleport to that position. It might not be as natural as walking, but it should help keep you from bumping into real-world walls that you can’t see. Other VR systems (like the HTC Vive) have technology to detect physical objects in your path and warn you to stay out of their way.

The Vive, for instance, actually has a camera, but it isn’t used in normal interaction and doesn’t even need to be on. The “chaperone” system is just based on fixed user-drawn line distance to the static laser sensors, which doesn’t use cameras at all, just precise timings on lasers and IR sensors on the tracked components.

Don’t get me wrong, I love my Vive, but the chaperone system is just a static user-drawn set of borders. The Vive doesn’t have the capability to “detect physical objects” besides the headset, the controllers, and the upcoming Trackers. If someone moves a chair, or a cat wanders into the designated area, the Vive has no way of knowing about the change. The universe, as far as the Vive knows, consists of two Lighthouses, a headset, and some controllers. The chaperone space is relative to the Lighthouses; as long as the Lighthouses are fixed *relative to each other*, the chaperone walls and the “floor” beneath it will be fixed relative to the Lighthouses, even if they were spinning, gravity were turned off, or objects were randomly moving through the space (but not… Read more » Vote Up0Vote Down  Reply 14 hours 12 minutes ago Latest News Samsung Chromebook Pro coming May 28th, will get some Android features before smartphones The Samsung Chromebook Pro is a notebook with a 12.3 inch, 2400 x 1600 pixel … [Read More...] Google Android graphics drivers will be updatable via the Play Store There are some parts of mobile operating systems like Google Android that can … [Read More...] Do not reboot your PC if you get WannaCry ransomeware – try this instead Computers around the world started to fall prey to a ransomware attack called … [Read More...] Deals Deals of the Day (5-19-2017) Didn't manage to snag the Ooontz Angle 3 Plus Bluetooth speaker while it was on … [Read More...] Featured articles Differences between Windows 10 S, Home, Pro, Enterprise, and Education This week Microsoft introduced a new version of Windows 10 which is designed for … [Read More...] This might be the best MP3 player you can get for $1.50 Need a cheap MP3 player?

Liliputing LPX Show Mini PCs Reviews Deals Shop About Contact us Advertise on Liliputing About Liliputing Privacy Statement Google Pixel Launcher from Android O DP2 ported to run on Android 6.0 or later 05/19/2017 at 1:00 PM by Brad Linder Leave a Comment Google Android O Developer Preview 2 (or beta 1) is now available for recent Nexus and Pixel devices, but it’s not just the operating system that’s getting an overhaul. Google is also working on light-weight versions of some of its core apps to run on the Android Go version of the operating system, which is aimed at entry-level devices with less than 1GB of RAM. And the company has also developed an updated Pixel Launcher that functions as the default home screen and app drawer for Pixel and Pixel XL phones running Android O. But thanks to xda-developers forum member linuxct, you can also install the new Pixel Launcher on just about any device running Android 6.0.1 or later. You can also download a version of the Pixel Launcher from the APKMirror website, but some users have reported problems with that version, so Linuxct created a modified version that should work properly on a wider range of devices. For the most part the new Pixel Launcher looks… a lot like the old one. You access the app drawer by swiping up from the bottom of the screen. And instead of a Google search bar at the top of the screen, there’s a button that you press to slide out the search box. There is one key new feature though: you can long-press on any app icon to preview any available widgets for that app without pulling up the full widget browser. There’s no sign of a search button at the bottom of the screen or an option to “change icon shapes,” as some folks have found in some versions of the Pixel Launcher during Google IO this week. I took the new launcher for a spin on my unrooted Nexus 5X running Android 7.1 and everything seems to be working properly. via xda-developers Share this: Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Email Leave a Reply Be the First to Comment!

Liliputing LPX Show Mini PCs Reviews Deals Shop About Contact us Advertise on Liliputing About Liliputing Privacy Statement Google Android graphics drivers will be updatable via the Play Store 05/19/2017 at 3:00 PM by Brad Linder 2 Comments There are some parts of mobile operating systems like Google Android that can only be updated by pushing out a new version of the OS. But over the past few years, Google has uncoupled a bunch of core features of the operating system so that updates can be delivered via the Google Play Store and updates to Google Play Services. While the company still can’t seem to manage an emoji update without releasing a new version of Android, soon you’ll be able to update the graphics drivers on your device through the Play Store. Speaking at the Android Fireside Chat during the Google IO developer conference, Google’s Android graphics team manager Romain Guy said “we now, in O, have the ability to update the graphics driver from the Play Store.” That’s about all that was said on the topic, so we’ll probably have to wait for Android O to launch later this year to find out how it works. And it’ll probably be up to chip designers and device makers to work with Google to actually implement the feature, so there’s no guarantee that new graphics drivers will roll out to all devices as soon as they’re available. But at least now it’s a possibility. As Android Police notes, this is likely due to Google’s new Project Treble, which separates out the Android OS framework from vendor-specific changes, which should theoretically make it easier for device makers and wireless carriers to push updates to users more quickly.

That stock price rally comes despite an already high valuation multiple, which appears to price in some very lofty expectations for growth. Why the surge? Nvidia continues to prove it’s the company of the future. The technology powerhouse, which was named Yahoo Finance’s 2016 company of the year, powers Google searches, Amazon’s Alexa digital assistant, Tesla’s self-driving cars and Netflix’s movie recommendations. And it’s become a dominant force in the continued shift toward artificial intelligence. The excitement over this company’s prospects can be seen across tech, including the big-cap tech. View photos An aerial view of the new Apple headquarters (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)More The impressive 19% gain for the S&P 500 (^GSPC) over the last year is eclipsed by the 32% surge in the Nasdaq 100 (^NDX). Importantly, the source of the Nasdaq’s outperformance are the major tech stocks, including Apple (AAPL) , Alphabet (GOOGL) , Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN) and Facebook (FB), which make up 42% of the Nasdaq 100 versus 13% of the S&P. Source: Goldman Sachs Weekly Kickstart presentationMore And much of the upward movement of these names may not even incorporate optimism around long-term opportunities where monetization remains elusive. Amazon At an incredibly high 81x forward P/E, Amazon has not been trading on traditional metrics for some time. But Needham analyst Kerry Rice said the high price doesn’t even incorporate long-term bets at this point. “A lot of investors are counting on that at some point Amazon flips the switch on profitability where they pull back on investing and you get a hockey stick trajectory of profitability,” Rice said. In other words, because the company could eventually become significantly more profitable, its P/E multiple is only temporarily elevated. The $450 billion company has continued to soar on progress in its core business, with its first quarter report merely the latest sign of dominance. Its stock is up almost 1,300% in the last ten years. Last quarter, revenue of $35.7 billion topped analyst estimates, and the key focus remains the near-term market opportunity. With about 100 million monthly unique visitors and about $1 out of every $3 spent online, analysts say there is still considerable upside in the core e-commerce business (with still only 10% of retail today). And growth in Amazon Web Services (AWS) is boosting profitability. View photos   Bezos’ longer-term vision isn’t even baked in to the company’s seemingly high multiple, according to analysts. The company has several multi-billion dollar opportunities, according to Rice, including video, advertising, groceries, and home services. In his most recent shareholder letter, Bezos highlighted that Amazon remains a “Day 1 company,” just at the beginning of its potential. “The outside world can push you into Day 2 if you won’t or can’t embrace powerful trends quickly,” Bezos wrote. “If you fight them, you’re probably fighting the future. Embrace them and you have a tailwind.” Long-term projects like autonomous Prime Air delivery drones could lead to more upside, but in the meantime Bezos has focused on near-term practical applications of technology, which is really what is driving the stock, according to analysts. Read More Bezos emphasized in his letter that the company’s focus on artificial intelligence has led to outward facing initiatives like cloud-based AI assistant Alexa (the company announced updates to Amazon Echo on Tuesday). But it has also driven much beneath the surface, “quietly but meaningfully improving core operations,” including algorithms that aid with demand forecasting, product search ranking, merchandising placements and fraud detection for the core business. Apple With an $800 billion market capitalization, Apple’s more tempered valuation (15x forward earnings) is still based on growth for its core product, the iPhone, which makes up 60% of company revenue. And even the company’s most recent quarterly results were overshadowed by expectations of the next smartphone (the iPhone 8 expected this fall, a decade after the initial iPhone launch). CEO Tim Cook said that iPhone demand this past quarter may have begun to “pause” in anticipation of new offerings, particularly in China which is even more sensitive to new announcements. Meanwhile, the company’s services business remains a quiet beast, according to Credit Suisse’s Kulbinder Garcha, who pointed out that the division’s revenue could rise to $52 billion from $26 billion today. And given that gross margins for services are around 70%, it would mean services will drive gross margin over 40% longer-term . While headlines continue to pop up about opportunities in automobiles, none of this is baked into the stock at these levels, according to Canaccord’s Michael Walkley, particularly at such a subdued valuation. Alphabet Ever since Alphabet separated its “other bets” business from its core search platform Google in the beginning of 2016, the stock has surged. And the company’s 24x forward P/E valuation is largely based on strong core results, according to analysts. In its most recent quarter, paid clicks grew 53% across Google-owned sites. Growth in its core search business has allowed the company to focus and separate its longer term projects. View photos   Today’s “Other Bets”—which include smart-home technology Nest, autonomous driving, and Google Fiber to improve internet speeds—could potentially bring in significant revenue down the road and  keep the company relevant, according to analysts. “But right now, no one is buying the stock for those reasons,” Rice said. “Autonomous driving may be more impactful five to ten years out,” Rice said. Facebook At 1.9 billion monthly users, an increase of 17% year-over-year, Facebook isn’t showing any signs of slowing down. And the stock, trading at 22x forward P/E, was little changed after its most recent quarter despite commentary from founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg and COO Sheryl Sandberg that revenue growth would decline “meaningfully” as it stops increasing the frequency of marketing spots in the news feed later this year in an effort to retain users. Rice explained the near-term levers for the company haven’t even been flipped on. Mobile now accounts for 85% of its advertising revenue and the company is looking forward to more opportunities. Instagram, with 700 million monthly active users, has just started adding to revenue growth. Zuckerberg said he has been focused on monetizing Messenger, which was spun off as a separate app in 2014, thoughtfully. The app now has 1.2 billion monthly users. WhatsApp, which was acquired in 2014 for $22 billion, is a big monetization opportunity for the company as well. While Zuckerberg is seen as a visionary, Rice said at this point longer-term bets are not baked into valuation—and mobile-driven surge since its IPO five years ago. View photos During the company’s recent F8 conference, management highlighted its augmented reality platform which includes “Facebook Faces,” the new social experience for Oculus Rift.  Management even discussed projects including its unmanned solar-powered aicraft that will beam internet connectivity to people around the world and brain interfaces (mind control!). “Investors have fallen in love with Facebook,” according to Mark Moerdler said. “There are expectations for huge upside from a revenue point of view… especially long-term. But much of this is based on clearly outlined near-term opportunities from the company.” Microsoft Part of the driver behind Microsoft’s surge over the last several years is because of the company’s shift to cloud and long-term projects under CEO Satya Nadella who took over in early 2014. In short, the company is often discussed in the same breath as Amazon and Google and has somehow left the sphere of “old tech” and into “new tech”. And Microsoft’s valuation, at 21x forward P/E, has pulled away from “old tech” names it used to be grouped with, like IBM (IBM) at 12x. But “new tech” for Microsoft hasn’t meant out-there long-term projects. The stock, up 36% in the last year alone, has been able to monetize its shift to cloud, according to analysts. While the company still relies on some of its traditional applications (like Office), commercial cloud revenues have grown to about 60% of the business. The company’s acquisition of LinkedIn in June 2016 was emblematic of the company’s shift for near-term opportunities in a higher-growth arena. The bottom line: Tech companies have been surging based on huge market opportunities, but the valuations may not even incorporate long-term bets, meaning there could even be more upside for this sector, which has been defined as driven by “secular growth” and more immune from macro shifts.

You do it, I do it, everybody does it. And now Google (GOOG, GOOGL) wants to get in on your TV time with its new YouTube TV streaming service. Available in select cities for $35 a month, YouTube TV promises 40 channels of live TV including the five major broadcast channels: ABC, CBS, CW, FOX and NBC. Google, though, is entering an increasingly crowded market with a wide variety of different channel offerings that can be difficult to parse when all you want to do is watch “The Bachelor” and eat your KFC $20 Fill-Up in your comfy chair. But since I care so much, I’m breaking down each of the major over-the-top cable streaming services so you can get back to watching the rose ceremony. Still, not all over-the-top services offer the same channels. YouTube TV is missing Turner and Viacom properties. Sony’s (SNE) PlayStation Vue is also missing Viacom channels, while Dish’s (DISH) Sling TV and AT&T’s (T) DirecTV Now don’t offer CBS. That said, at least one of these options could be right for you. YouTube TV View photos We’ve been waiting a long time for Google’s big TV play and it’s officially here. YouTube TV features 40 channels and gets you everything from the major broadcast channels to a huge array of sports stations. In fact, YouTube TV gives you 13 sports channels and the option to add on Fox Soccer Plus. Outside of that, you get Fox News, MSNBC, Disney, National Geographic, Bravo, USA, FX and E!, among others. Google says it will add AMC and BBC World News to its lineup in the near future. You can also add Showtime for $11 a month extra. But YouTube TV has some drawbacks. First off, the service doesn’t carry Turner properties like CNN, TBS, TNT and, importantly for me, Cartoon Network. You also don’t get Viacom channels like MTV or Comedy Central. What’s worse, there doesn’t appear to be an option to add on HBO just yet, only Showtime. What’s more, YouTube TV isn’t available for Roku streaming devices or Apple TV. To address that, Google will provide you with a free Chromecast so you can stream your favorite shows to your big-screen. Still, if you’re a Roku or Apple TV user, that means having to bounce between those devices and your Chromecast just to watch different channels, which can be annoying. Sony PlayStation Vue View photos Sony’s PlayStation Vue is the Japanese tech giant’s over-the-top streaming play and it’s actually a quality offering. Rather than a one-size-fits-all offering, Sony offers four different packages depending on the number of channels you want to watch and how much you want to pay each month. The base offering, which starts at $40 per month, gets you 49 channels including ABC, CBS, FOX and NBC, as well as CNN, Fox News, MSNBC, ESPN and ESPN 2, FS1 and FS2 and a slew of others. Oh, and Cartoon Network. Sony’s $45 package gets you more than 60 channels, while the $55 package gets you more than 90 channels. Then there’s the $75 option, which includes the NFL Network and HBO. Sony, however, recently did away with Viacom content like Comedy Central. So if you’re trying to watch the “Daily Show,” you’re out of luck. Vue is available on a number of devices including, naturally, Sony’s PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4, web browsers, Apple TV, Roku, Amazon’s (AMZN) Fire TV and your mobile devices. If you’re already a PlayStation fan, Vue is a solid choice. Read More Sling TV View photos Dish’s Sling TV offers three packages Orange, Blue and Orange + Blue with a host of additional add-ons to customize your viewing options. The Orange package costs $20 per month and gets you 30 channels including ESPN, AMC, CNN, TBS, Comedy Central, Travel Channel and, of course, Cartoon Network. What you don’t get are the basic broadcast channels like ABC, CBS, FOX, NBC or the CW. The Blue package costs $25 per month and gets you 45 channels including FOX and NBC. The Orange + Blue package, which costs $40 per month, gets you 50 channels. Here’s the thing, though — you can add a range of different channels to any of the three packages. For instance, the New Extra add-on gets you MSNBC, BBC World News and Headline News for $5. Comedy Plus Extra, also $5, gets you MTV, Spike, MTV2 and CMT, which means you can watch “Steve Austin’s Broken Skull Challenge,” the greatest show on television. Curiously, Sling doesn’t include CBS. So “Big Bang Theory” fans, you know who you are, won’t be able to watch their favorite show. Sling TV is available on most mainstream TV streaming devices including Apple TV, Roku and Amazon’s Fire TV players, as well as Apple, Android and Amazon phones and tablets, Mac and Windows computers and Microsoft’s Xbox One. Unfortunately, you can’t watch Sling TV on your PlayStation. If you’re the kind of person who wants greater control over what channels you pay for, Sling TV is the way to go. AT&T DirecTV Now View photos Like Sling TV, AT&T’s DirecTV Now allows you to purchase different packages of channels based on what you want to want and how much you want to pay each month. The base offering starts at $35 per month and gets you more than 60 channels including ABC, NBC and FOX, but not CBS and the CW. You also get CNN, Fox News, MSNBC, ESPN, Disney, Cartoon Network and Comedy Central. The $50 option gets you more than 80 channels, while the $60 package gets more than 100. The largest option is the $70 package, which gives you more than 120 channels, enough to keep you on your couch for quite some time. You can subscribe to HBO GO as part of your package for an additional fee. AT&T lets you watch DirecTV Now on your Amazon Fire TV, Apple TV, Android phone and tablet, iPad and iPhone, Chromecast and web browsers. But you can’t watch it on your Chromecast with the iOS app, your Roku or Xbox One. As with YouTube TV, DirecTV Now gives you a streaming device, in this case a Fire TV stick, with your first month’s payment.

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars AI Guest How brands will connect to customers through voicebots Gregg Johnson, Invoca@gregg_johnson May 19, 2017 2:10 PM Image Credit: Shutterstock.com / pianodiaphragm Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant have dramatically simplified how humans can interact with brands to complete everyday tasks, from ordering a coffee or pizza to paying a credit card bill, through a simple voice interface. Yet the latest innovations from Amazon and Google support the oldest form of human communication: human-to-human conversation. At the I/O developer conference this week, Google announced that its voice-activated speaker, Google Home, will now support phone calls, and its voice-controlled Assistant on mobile will allow purchases via voice. Earlier this month Amazon introduced Echo Show, a device with a screen for video calls, and Alexa Calling, a feature for voice calls and messaging through the Echo and Alexa mobile app. Voice-controlled devices are changing how we communicate not just with our digital assistants, but with other people. It’s important to note that these innovations don’t obviate human conversation; they supplement and encourage it by removing the friction of picking up a phone, opening an app, or typing a message. It won’t be long before we expect this kind of experience when communicating with a business. We’ve seen this pattern before — consumer technologies like Facebook and Twitter emerge, gain traction in our personal lives, and within a year or two become mainstream in business settings. This is a wake-up call for brands that approach the digital experience as a series of taps and swipes. Companies that value customer experience will figure out how to blend digital interactions with voice. And they’ll win. Some companies are already using a mix of bots and humans to respond to customer communications. Stockholm-based Swedbank uses a chatbot on its website to answer questions about foreign currency rates and branch locations. The bot solves consumers’ problems about 80 percent of the time, and the remaining 20 percent are routed to support staff, who can answer more complex account questions. These more complex interactions make or break the customer experience. They’re the points where sales are made and loyalty is cemented — or not. For the foreseeable future, the best experiences will come from a mix of voice-powered automation and human interaction. While most people are amenable to an automated voice control system if it works well, research shows that people prefer a live conversation with a human to resolve more complex and emotional issues. Businesses need to bring humans into the conversation at the moment when it best serves the customer. Amazon is working on solving this problem, too. In March, the company introduced cloud-based call center software called AWS Connect that uses the natural language processing and speech recognition technology behind Alexa to interpret what callers want and routes their calls accordingly. Imagine calling an airline, saying “I’d like to change my flight this evening,’ and having a rep immediately talk through three different options on how to get home quickly. AWS Connect isn’t meant to replace call center staff or automate the majority of their work. Instead, it helps them do their jobs more effectively while improving the caller experience. By recognizing natural speech, it replaces tedious phone menus, eliminates unnecessary transfers, and provides reps with context about a caller by pulling in CRM data from Salesforce. It opens up the potential for a new kind of service that combines humans and technology to provide the best possible experience. If the past few weeks are any indication, Amazon and Google will continue to invest in voice technology and bring new features to bear. The market for standalone voice-controlled devices is expected to grow some 128 percent this year over 2016, according to eMarketer. That’s not to mention voice assistants like Siri and Google Now, which are used by 1 in 4 smartphone users. As voice becomes a more popular communication tool for consumers, businesses will need to evolve the customer experience to blend digital interaction (screens, clicks, swipes) with voice automation (Alexa, Siri) and live human conversation. The companies that master this combination will nail the customer experience, which will only become a more strategic differentiator as communication technologies evolve.

The move illustrates one way that Google is using its increased focus on artificial intelligence and machine learning. If you're wondering why and how Google can make these suggestions, here are some answers about the feature and how it works. -- What's going on? Google calls the feature Smart Reply, and it's pretty much what it sounds like. Google algorithms are scanning your messages and using the information it gleans to suggest ways that you could reply to any given message. The feature is based off an idea from Gmail engineer Bálint Miklós, Google said in a 2015 blog post. Miklós asked the Google Research team if there was any way to create some tappable template replies in Gmail. There are, after all, plenty of emails to which one could respond with just a "Got it," "Thanks," or "See you soon!" Having some pre-made responses at one's fingertips would save everyone a little more time, Miklós thought. -- Why am I seeing this now? Google users have had access to this feature since 2015, but only in Google's smaller and more experimental Inbox app. And the suggestions offered by the feature have been getting steadily more advanced as it's learned from the decisions of more customers. Based on that success, Google has decided it was ready for more general use. -- How does it work? Smart Reply relies on machine learning to scan the subject line and body of an email and make suggestions based on what it sees. The company said it has built up a huge bank of anonymized customer messages and response decisions to help accomplish this. It is also designed to remember your individual preferences for things, such as punctuation. So it will be able to adjust its suggestions depending on whether you're a "Thanks!" or "Thanks." type of person. Smart Replies won't appear on every email though, Google said. You're most likely to see response suggestions on emails that can be easily answered with a simple sentence or two. -- So ... is someone at Google reading my email? There is no person at Google reading your email, according to Google. Even when research scientists were building the feature and trying to suss out which responses matched which messages, they designed their testing to make sure that no person ever read a Gmail user's email. But it does mean that Google's software is scanning your messages, much in the same way that its spell-checkers and spam filters do right now. Google anonymizes all the data from these tools, but the fact that your messages are being scanned is still worth noting. -- Can I turn if off? Yes. You are able to turn off Smart Reply through your settings menu. -- How well does it work? Smart Reply suggestions have been getting steadily better as the feature has matured and learned from users' decisions. But it's still not perfect. Language, after all, is a complicated thing. Google researchers Brian Strope and Ray Kurzweil wrote about how difficult it is to parse the sentence, "That interesting person at the cafe we like gave me a glance," in a blog post this week. "In proposing an appropriate response to this message we might consider the meaning of the word "glance," which is potentially ambiguous. Was it a positive gesture? In that case, we might respond, "Cool!" Or was it a negative gesture? If so, does the subject say anything about how the writer felt about the negative exchange? A lot of information about the world, and an ability to make reasoned judgments, are needed to make subtle distinctions." Plus, our emails, particularly from mobile devices, tend to be riddled with idioms that make no actual sense. Things change depending on context: Something "wicked" could be good or very bad, for example. Not to mention, sarcasm is a thing. Which is all to warn you that you may still get a wildly random and even potentially inappropriate suggestion - I once got an "Oh no!" suggestion to a friend's self-deprecating pregnancy announcement, for example. If the email only calls for a one- or two-sentence response, you'll probably find Smart Reply useful. If it requires any nuance, though, it's still best to use your own human judgment.

MarTech, conversational UI, and the future of connecting with customers Contributor Jeff Eckman recaps a session by MarTech San Francisco 2017 speaker Nick Pandolfi of Google’s Global Product Partnerships team in which he shares Google’s view on this emerging topic, as well as five tips on designing for the conversational interface. Jeff Eckman on May 18, 2017 at 10:48 am More Of the growing set of new themes in the exceptional content at this year’s MarTech San Francisco conference, one stood out in particular: conversational interfaces. Conversational interfaces, or virtual assistants, are growing in popularity and use by marketers. Nick Pandolfi of Google’s Product Partnerships team closed out the Experience Track at MarTech SF 2017 with a 20-minute TED-style talk on the “next new wave” of interfaces: conversational agents. Here is my digest of Pandolfi’s enlightening presentation, which includes Google’s view on this emerging topic, as well as five tips on designing for the conversational interface. The next interaction paradigm In the continuing evolution of the digital frames we interact with, the next new wave of computing, Pandolfi suggested, is conversational agents. Beginning with websites created by publishers, we’ve seen developers make the progression from the browser to touch apps on mobile devices. Conversational agents — in essence, services — enabled by virtual assistants are the next means of interaction with computers. Websites > Touch Apps > Conversational Agents What is different about conversational agents is less about the technology itself, more about the new nature of the design. Whereas the design principles used for websites and touch apps are about purposeful guiding of the user, conversational agents are about engaging in a dialogue, and thus, Pandolfi explains, “the design requirements are totally different.” Background on conversational user interfaces (CUIs) We are all now familiar with voice recognition and its growing accuracy, efficacy and utility. Apple’s Siri, Amazon’s Alexa and the Google Assistant are CUIs that are becoming ubiquitous. This now taken-for-granted technology has been rapidly enabled and enhanced by machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) for speech recognition and improved text-to-voice quality. In addition to the smartphone, tablet, desktop/laptop and in-home devices, CUIs are now appearing in watches and in cars. To support growth and proliferation across multiple media, companies including Google are providing SDKs (software development kits) for engineers to develop virtual assistants for deployment on multiple devices. The idea is to build an experience once and publish on multiple platforms. Making the CUI The tools to build and deploy CUIs already exist within a growing ecosystem. Actions on Google is the company’s platform for developers to use to build CUIs for the Google Assistant. Pandolfi talked about API.AI as a core tool for CUI creation, and specifically noted that there is growing support for creating CUIs within graphic UI-based tools like API.AI and Gupshup — i.e., no code required. Again, Pandolfi reiterated, the hard part is in the design, not the development. Accordingly, he provided some of his suggestions for getting started with CUIs from a design perspective. 5 tips for conversational UI design Start small. Rather than attempting to take your entire set of customer touch points into CUI-land, start with something small — perhaps one component, and/or something with a short length of engagement. Pandolfi cited Progressive Insurance as an example of a firm that’s deployed CUI in a tight, specific manner. Create a persona based on brand. Create a style guide, and use recorded audio, or the voice of an actor who may be the face of your brand. One example Pandolfi provided included an iHeartRadio execution used in conjunction with the iHeartRadio Music Awards. Dialog design. “Think like a screenwriter,” Pandolfi suggested. Start with use cases, then diagram dialogues. Keep in mind that the welcome message sets the tone and helps guide the user, setting expectations upfront. Then think about and design how the dialogue branches. Once the dialogue design is complete, then use the technology, i.e., execute the development. Context matters. Thinking about the customer’s where, what and when is key in design. For example, is the user on the phone or on the go, calling for a shorter dialogue? Or are they at home, where a longer dialogue may make sense? Where is the customer in a process flow? Using the contexts of environmental, situational, temporal and mental/behavioral, design and adjust your conversational actions based on context. Error handling. “In Conversations, there are no ‘errors.’” Pandolfi suggested taking care not to insult the intelligence of the user. People understand how to talk, so be natural. Let them know what their options are. And know that users want to be on the right path. Pandolfi provided some helpful guidance on how to think about potential dead-ends and their mitigation. Pandolfi’s session concluded with a brief audience Q&A and some post-session discussion. In 20 short minutes, the talk offered the audience an opportunity to learn about conversational interfaces, both introductory and in-depth, and served as a practical guide for getting started or enhancing an existing CUI program.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 19 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman UENI is Launching New Online Solutions for Small Businesses Special launch offer provides ten free calls from new customers LONDON, UNITED KINGDOM, May 19, 2017 /EINPresswire.com/ — London, May 17, 2017 – UENI, a technology provider for local businesses, is launching a new suite of products at The Business Show 2017. It has announced three new packages for small businesses – Starter, Plus, and Premium. The UENI Starter pack provides a free web presence to small businesses with a webpage that lists their business description, opening hours, and contact information. Upgrading the Starter Package to Plus for just £1 a day unlocks and displays the business contact information on the page, all of the business’s services and prices, and the ability to receive unlimited bookings and enquiries from potential customers. This package also includes a Facebook Business page with a custom tab that shows all their services and prices, along with the ability to book them, and a Google My Business page. Small businesses can also upgrade to a Premium package from £5 a day, which provides all the features of the Plus package and accelerates leads and bookings through Google and Facebook ads. Small businesses won’t have to deal with the complexities of advertising on Google and Facebook because UENI provides a complete solution, from researching keywords to writing ad copies and tracking online bookings and calls to the business from paid advertising. UENI also provides an easy to understand “value for money report” with details on how many customers contacted the business through the UENI tools. Christine Telyan, co-founder and co-CEO of UENI said, “A lot of small local businesses don’t have the time or resources to create and maintain an online presence and use digital advertising tools to get new customers. This puts small businesses at a disadvantage as they do not get in front of target clients who use search engines and other websites to look for local services. They are also unable to influence those consumers, who live near their business and can be prime targets for booking their services.” UENI founders realized that millions of small businesses across Europe don’t have an online presence and there is no easy way to find them. UENI sends its location experts to visit the locations of these small businesses to capture information about them. UENI then creates a Starter webpage for them to get them a free online presence. To date, UENI local business location experts have visited 150,000 small businesses across 8 European countries. UENI has announced a special offer for the launch. Small businesses can get a 30-day free trial of its Plus package and ten free customer calls. The offer can be redeemed at http://join.ueni.com/show. About UENI UENI was founded in 2015 by Christine Telyan and Anh Pham Vu to provide quick, easy and inexpensive solutions to small businesses to get them online and find them new customers. UENI is also planning to launch an online marketplace for consumers in the future where they will be able to find local businesses. UENI is headquartered in Hammersmith, London and has operations across Europe.

But “Android O”—which should get a dessert-based moniker when it ships later this summer—does have a set of features that Google (GOOG, GOOGL) pitched over the first day of its I/O developer conference here. As in earlier updates, Android O brings a grab-bag of features. Some address lingering pain points in this mobile operating system, while others borrow from features Apple (AAPL) added to iOS. Another represents an overdue remedy for a problem that’s afflicted Android since its debut almost nine years ago: the zombie-like persistence of obsolete versions. And of course, there’s better emoji support. Project Treble: easing updates, we can only hope The most important part of O—a rebuilding of Android’s foundation to remove an obstacle to timely software updates—barely got a mention in the almost-two-hour keynote from Google CEO Sundar Pichai and other Googlers that opened I/O at the Shoreline Amphitheatre Wednesday. But there’s no missing the reason for its existence in the embarrassing pie chart on Google’s Android-development site showing the versions of Android in use.  As of May 2, the current Nougat release that debuted last August runs on 7.1% of all devices that had connected to the Play Store in the prior seven days. The most widely used Android release was the two-year-old Marshmallow, on 31.2% of devices. At Apple, meanwhile, 79% of iOS devices that visited the App Store on Feb. 20 ran the current iOS 10 release. Project Treble, announced in a blog post last week, aims to free chipset vendors from having to tweak the code that keeps their circuitry talking to the rest of Android. Treble will add a layer of translation code between that proprietary software and the rest of Android—the equivalent of putting a standard-size joint atop some intricate plumbing in the basement. A hardware vendor can write Treble-compliant, circuit-specific code once for a device and know that future versions of Android will understand it without further rewrites. That won’t end all Android-update holdups. As this post from Ron Amadeo at Ars Technica explains, Treble won’t stop phone vendors from shipping weird Android interfaces (hello, Samsung!) that demand their own revisions. But it’s an important step in an operating system that now runs on more than 2 billion active devices. Security and privacy The afterlife of abandoned versions of Android remains the biggest problem in Android security, but many users worry instead that they’ll pick up malware in the Play Store. In reality, that’s a vanishingly small risk compared to the odds of getting hacked after downloading an app from elsewhere, thanks to a variety of malware scans that happen in the background. Android O will add more layers of security hardening but will also make these app-safety checks visible in a Google Play Protect feature showing their status. It’s literally security theatre. As Stephanie Saad Cuthbertson, product-management director for Android, said in the keynote, “Most Android users don’t know these services come built into Android devices with Play.” But if it gets people to trust the Play Store over less-secure sources, it’ll be a worthwhile production. This update will guard against a different device threat—a runaway app killing your battery life—by imposing limits on how often apps running in the background can ask for a device’s location or make other requests of the system. If that sounds like an overdue move… it probably is. In the area of privacy, Android O will randomly assign different device IDs to apps—a small but significant change that will make it harder for a developer of multiple apps to correlate your use among them. Notifications, picture-in-picture and other interface tweaks Read More Android O will require apps to group their notifications—the little nags that pop down from the top of the screen—into “channels” that you can turn on or off. It’s meant to stop apps from being too needy; in practice, having yet another option to set may not yield much difference. You’ll also be able to snooze notifications, which may help avoid losing sight of yet another message from a friend coming in on yet another messaging app. These changes should certainly help Android’s notifications experience stay ahead of the same in iOS, where you can’t even clear all notifications unless you use a device with Apple’s Touch ID pressure-sensitive control. App icons will be able to show a different sort of notice: colored “notification dots” at the top right corner of each that indicate something’s changed. That seems a pretty clear case of Google following Apple’s lead, not that there’s anything wrong with that. A picture-in-picture option will pick up on the examples of some Android vendors by letting you watch a video clip or chat in one corner while taking notes or checking your calendar. The interface change I’m most likely to appreciate: “Smart Text Selection,” in which Android will automatically select all of a street address, phone number or other significant block of text once you start trying to pick it up. This won’t work out of the box (as I saw in a demo phone), because Android will use “on-device intelligence” to build a phone-specific model of the kinds of data you often copy and paste. By not syncing this personal data to the cloud—as Cuthbertson boasted, “without any data leaving the device”—Google borrows yet again from its neighbors at Apple.

At its I/O conference here, Google (GOOG, GOOGL) touted the progress of Accelerated Mobile Pages, an ambitious initiative to remake the mobile web into a faster, lighter and less irritating medium—yes, even the ads that help pay for it. That is a laudable effort, and the web giant has a good story to tell so far. But it also needs to address lingering concerns about its intentions. Amped up about AMP The basic idea is to take the HTML code behind every web page and strip out the cruft: over-sized images, scripts that run redundantly in the background, and other junk that contributes nothing to the reading experience. The results can be impressive—see how fast this post can pop onto your phone in AMP form? At last year’s I/O, Google news head Richard Gingras said AMP pages load four times faster and use a tenth of the data of a non-AMP page. At a Wednesday evening presentation here, AMP lead Malte Ubl said better compression techniques allow images on AMP pages to need half as much data as a year ago. The AMP project only debuted in October of 2015, but now Google says more than 900,000 domains serve up over 2 billion AMP pages. At a “State of the Mobile Union” keynote Wednesday afternoon, Google product-management vice president Rahul Roy-Chowdhury noted recent support for the format by Twitter (TWTR) and China’s social-media platforms Weibo and Tencent. Tumblr, owned by this site’s parent firm Yahoo (YHOO), is joining them. There are sound reasons for this. While AMP wouldn’t exist without Google’s backing, it’s an open-source project that anybody else can use and revise—unlike proprietary fast-mobile-web efforts at Facebook (FB) and Apple (AAPL), Instant Articles and Apple News, that allow less flexibility. The British newspaper the Guardian recently dropped both Instant Articles and Apple News because they didn’t help it convince readers to sign up for paid memberships. “We’re bullish,” e-mailed Jason Kint, CEO of online-publishing trade group Digital Content Next. “Google AMP is a very promising as a strategy to protect the open web from the suffocation of Facebook’s closed platform business model.”   Address angst Kint, however, voiced wariness about how Google can push AMP pages before others, even if they may be svelte in their own right. Its mobile news search displays AMP pages first in a carousel of thumbnail previews you can easily flip through. “Google Search on mobile nearly requires participation in AMP if you want to be discovered,” he noted. An optional AMP feature yields another complication: a Google caching service that delivers pages even faster leaves them appearing at a google.com or ampproject.org address that can confuse users. For instance, my post about the upcoming Android O release appears not at the usual finance.yahoo.com domain name but at a much longer address that starts with “www.google.com/amp/s/www.yahoo.com.” At a Wednesday evening presentation, Google representatives acknowledged this frustration and said AMP pages served from the company’s cache now include a banner with the correct address, which you can tap and hold to copy for sharing elsewhere. Google is also moving to revise that cached address so it starts with the domain name of the original site—yahoo.ampproject.org, for instance. And publishers may have other options: In January, the web-hosting company CloudFlare announced its own AMP caching service and said it’s working on ways to keep pages at the right address. Mobile ads you may not hate Read More A presentation Thursday morning covered another aspect of AMP you may not want to admit to appreciating: less annoying ads. Google software engineer Michael Kleber explained how AMP ads can’t move around on a page or block its content, can’t hold up the rest of the page from loading, and can’t play video automatically. They also must run in a “sandbox” that quarantines any hostile code and can be closed by the page if it bogs down everything. This doesn’t limit AMP ads to being simple banners. A demo showed how this stripped-down code can allow for an ad in which the content changes as you scroll down the page, highlighting various parts of a car. Kleber also cited studies showing that AMP ads get seen and clicked through more. He cited a series of ads from the firm TripleLift on Time, Inc. (TIME) sites that were three times lighter and six times faster to load than non-AMP versions, and which generated 13% more revenue. As somebody who writes for a variety of ad-supported sites, that sounds pretty good. But remember that the AMP spec doesn’t ban ads that are light, efficient and repellent. You can use this format to crank out sleazy “around the web” clickbait ads (if you want to make your eyes bleed, read Amanda Hess’s New York Times recap of clicking through dozens of them) and spam people with creepy “retargeting” ads trying to get them to complete purchases contemplated on other sites. AMP also can’t force desktop sites to shape up their act, even if well-done AMP sites start to make them look like hot garbage in comparison. Memo to web designers and publishers: Mobile users aren’t the only people online who don’t want their time or bandwidth wasted.

Home Mail Flickr Tumblr News Sports Finance Celebrity Answers Groups Mobile More Yahoo Search Search 0 Tech Home Follow Us Reviews How To Deals Video Games Pogue Apple Pogue Amazon's Alexa Calling is like a Jetsons version of the home phone David Pogue Yahoo Finance May 19, 2017 Reblog Share Tweet Share For what was originally supposed to be a mail-order bookstore, Amazon (AMZN) sure is doing a lot of trailblazing. I mean, Amazon came up with the idea for the Echo—the cylinder that serves as a sort of Siri for the home—all by itself. It invented that product category, putting Google, Apple, Microsoft, and Samsung into the awkward position of being copycat followers. Now that more than 10 million people have Echo devices, Amazon has just taken another trailblazing step: With a free software update, it has turned them into hands-free speakerphones. Calling Chris is as easy as saying “Alexa, call Chris” from across the room, even if your hands are goopy with flour or you can’t find your phone. Over at Chris’s house, the ring atop the Echo pulses green, a pleasant chime sounds, and Alexa announces, “David [or whatever your name is] would like to talk.” Chris says “Alexa, answer,” and the conversation begins. At the end of the call, either one of you can say “Alexa, hang up” to end the chat. So whom can you call? Anyone in your phone’s address book who has either an Amazon Echo or the free Alexa app. That’s right: The Alexa app is now an internet calling app, like Skype or FaceTime Audio. Like them, it’s free and doesn’t use any cellular calling minutes. [Update: Not to be outdone, Google has now announced that it will bring hands-free calling to Google Home, its Alexa clone—except those calls go to regular phone numbers. No charge.] By the way: Although the big-ticket item here is hands-free speakerphone calls, there’s also what Amazon calls messaging. It’s not what you’d think, though. It’s not sending text messages, exactly. And it’s not voicemail, exactly. It’s a cool kind of hybrid. Within the app, you can text with keyboard or by voice.More You say “Alexa, send a message to Chris,” and you’re invited to speak a message. You’re sending an audio recording. The ring at the top of Chris’s Echo glows green and chimes once; when Chris says, “Alexa, play my message,” your recording plays back. But if Chris opens the Alexa app, your message also plays there, with an automated typed transcript. So it’s kinda like a text message in that way. Within the app, you can also send typed texts. It’s also kinda like voicemail, in that you can leave a recorded message for someone—but the difference is that you’re in control. You decide to leave a message before you even call, rather than just hoping the other person doesn’t answer. The help screens.More What it’s good for At its finest, Alexa Calling is like a Jetsons version of the home phone. Not only is it cordless, it’s phoneless. You don’t have to find a handset, pick it up, press buttons, hold it up to your head; you just speak into the room. You may sound pretty echoey to the other guy if you’re really far from the Echo—but if you’re within a few feet, it sounds great. And of course, if you’re using your phone instead of an Echo, it sounds just like a speakerphone call. It’s likely that there are some people you contact often enough that the Alexa calling thing could be handy—a sibling, parent, child, boss, lover. Alexa calling is the communication equivalent of the One-Click Buy button on Amazon.com: It eliminates so many steps, so much friction, that you’re inclined to use it more. Read More What it’s not good for There are plenty of limitations and footnotes to Alexa calling. These don’t mean that Alexa calling is worse than our existing communication methods—only that it’s got a different set of pros and cons. Limited calling circle. You can call only people who have an Amazon Echo, Echo Dot, or the free Alexa app. You can’t call someone who has the battery-operated Echo Tap, and you can’t call someone’s regular cellphone number. You can call only someone who’s (a) in your phone’s Contacts, and (b) has made himself available for Alexa calling. (The setup takes about five taps, and requires typing in a security code that Amazon sends you via text message.) So it’s a pretty small circle—but then again, Skype, WhatsApp, FaceTime, and Snapchat started with small networks, too. Everything rings simultaneously. When someone calls, all your Echos ring at once, and your phone app “rings.” In other words, you can’t use the Echos as an intercom within your house—but Amazon tells me that feature is coming soon. Very cool. It’s all speakerphone. If you have an Echo, all calls are all speakerphone, all the time. Any family member can hear. Any family member can play back the messages, too. So, you know: sext with care. Finally, at the moment, there’s no way to block incoming calls from specific people in your Contacts. You can turn on Do Not Disturb for all calls, but you can’t block just one idiot who’s abusing the privilege. The tech blogs are having a field day with this one, calling it a “glaring security hole” and conjuring up the prospect of unwanted incoming calls from abusive ex-boyfriends and creepy pedophiles. Frankly, though, the likelihood of this kind of abuse seems pretty slim. Your ex would have to know that you’ve got Alexa calling installed; would have to turn it on himself; would have to call you; and, upon hearing Alexa announce, “So and so would like to talk,” you’d have to say, “Alexa, answer.” Above all, you’d have to keep your ex in your Contacts. And why would you do that? In any case, Amazon says that it will add the option to block people within a few weeks. Chalk up another Amazon invention I’m already using Alexa calling for quick check-ins with my wife, my mom, and my assistant; it’s just super cool, easy, quick, and free. It’s got elements of a home phone line, a cellphone on speaker, and a walkie-talkie—but it’s not any of those. Amazon has big plans for Alexa calling. We know that you’ll soon be able to direct calls to specific people or devices within your house. We know that you’ll be able to make video calls using the same steps, once the new Echo Look becomes available in June. (It’s an Echo with a screen and camera.) We know that, with permission from both parties, you’ll be able to “drop in” to peek through another Echo’s camera at any time—to keep an eye on an elderly relative, for example. And I’ll bet that soon, Alexa will recognize who in your household is speaking (as Google Home does now), and will therefore maintain different message “boxes” for different people. In other words, I love Alexa calling. It’s free, it’s well conceived, it works flawlessly, and it’s only beginning.

SECTIONS Home Market Companies Economy Tech Auto Mutual Funds Stocks Currency Opinions Todays Paper E-Paper Horoscope Photos Video Photo Story Home Industry Technology Why Artificial Intelligence cannot be the last frontier for companies Why Artificial Intelligence cannot be the last frontier for companies Whether we want AI or not, it is going to be an important feature in our lives. By: Ishaan Gera | Published: May 20, 2017 2:20 AM AI is certainly bound to attract more users. So, it was not a surprise when Google announced an AI-first strategy at its I/O conference this year. Whether we want AI or not, it is going to be an important feature in our lives. While the first iterations did not attract many, with systems getting more intelligent, AI is certainly bound to attract more users. So, it was not a surprise when Google announced an AI-first strategy at its I/O conference this year. Basically, what this means is that Google will try to integrate as many services with its Assistant as it can over the coming years. Say, if one wants to book a cab-ride or a flight ticket, she would be able to do so using Google’s services as the company integrates more apps across the platform. While it has experimented with this in its existing systems—Maps allows you to book a cab without accessing an apps—with Google Assistant, one would not even require to access Maps. And, as it gets more smarter, it would book a cab itself once it senses a routine. But Google is not the only service vying for a chunk of the an AI-driven world. Apple, Microsoft, Amazon and Samsung have each announced an iteration of AI—and each of them claim theirs is smarter than the others. More recently, Samsung announced a personal assistant, Bixby, which will be an user-interface integrated AI for Samsung phones. Although it cannot play ‘trivial pursuit’ like Google or Siri can, it will be able to do a specific search on your phone, which the Assistant may not be able to do. But what Google’s, and for that matter, any other company’s, announcement also carries is a warning for future systems. There is no doubt that phones are set to get better, and all these AI digital assistants are intended to do make your life easier. But that should not mean a stopping of hardware innovations, especially of phones. Basically, companies would do well to avoid a Apple-rut in the coming years. While it is true that we want smarter devices, it is also true that we need newer devices, which Apple has missed over the last few years. While it improved an already perfect user-interface, the iPhone or Mac has looked and felt much the same. Camera upgrades have given some edge, but people now crave more. Samsung and others are now falling into the same rut or may do so once they focus more on improving the UI with AI. Augmented and virtual reality are expected to solve some of that problem, but ultimately companies have to change how we interact with phones and how they interact with us. A lot of it is visual, and no matter how many assistants exist, people would still want the comfort of a screen, at least for now. Samsung filing for flexible phones does allay some concerns, but material additions may not last for long. People and technology both have an uncanny way of altering the course of future. They may do so once again, with an out-of-the-box solution. No Comments.

Joy Hawkins on May 18, 2017 at 11:10 am More We all know that Google is constantly launching updates to their products (over 1,600 last year), and some of these changes are well covered and some slip by unnoticed. I have quietly been keeping track of some of the major changes I’ve noticed so far this year that would impact those of us who work in Local SEO and wanted to share my observations. 1. Google removes permanently closed listings from the Local Finder If you look at the picture from my article last year about permanently closed listings, you’ll see that there used to be tons of “permanently closed” listings ranking in the Local Finder. They would typically show up at the end of the list (after the open ones), and if you edited a ranking listing to make it appear permanently closed, it would instantly drop to the back of the list. I haven’t seen a single “permanently closed” listing in the Local Finder in months. This is mostly a good thing, since they aren’t overly useful for users. The “permanently closed” label is problematic for local SEOs in a couple of scenarios. The first would be for businesses that have practitioners. These are the industries that are most likely to have “permanently closed” listings floating out there that they don’t know about for their practitioners. They are now harder to find, but customers could still be seeing them while searching on Google. Tip: Search for all your existing and former practitioners on Google by name + city and make sure you don’t have any of these out there. The second problematic scenario would be when spammers start marking competitors as “permanently closed” to make them disappear. You won’t get any type of notification from Google when this happens to your business (Thanks, Google!) unless you visit your Google My Business dashboard daily. Tip: Since not everyone has time to do that, my suggestion would be to utilize a ranking tracker that also sends you alerts when they notice changes on your listing, like BrightLocal does. 2. Google removes the ability to access the classic version of Google Plus Google came out with the new version of Google Plus back in 2015, but up until a couple of months ago, they still kept the classic version accessible — and it was the version that Google cached in their search results. Why does this matter for local SEOs? The classic version had all the Name, Address, Phone Number (NAP) data on it that we loved so much, and the new version gives you none of this info. Many of us used the site:plus.google.com search to find duplicate listings for clients, and this function no longer works, since the cached version of Google Plus has no phone number, no address and no reviews. Tip: Unless you’re using Google Plus for posts that get lots of engagement, you don’t have much else to do over there, since it’s now almost completely divorced from Google My Business. Posting random links to your blog articles won’t help you unless they get shares, +1s or comments. 3. Google launches a platform for reviewing edits to business listings on Google Maps on Desktop Since MapMaker shut down, lots of people are under the impression that reviewing edits to business listings is no longer possible. Google has had the ability to review edits on the Google Maps app for quite some time, but since those of us in the local SEO industry rarely sit around doing client work on our phones, lots of people don’t realize this is possible. In March, Google also launched a “Check the Facts” feature on Desktop for Local Guides. This is a very simplified version of editing and isn’t really comparable to what we used to have on MapMaker, but it does allow for users to approve or deny each other’s edits to business listings. When this first launched, it was only available to Local Guides who were a Level 5 but rolled out to all Local Guides levels a few weeks later.     4. Google removes pending edits for a listing’s status from showing up on the Google Maps app I outlined in this article how spammers were attacking legit business listings by reporting their listings as spam just to get the pending status to show up on their listing on mobile. Indeed, these spammers shifted their focus to Trump Tower at one point, and searching for it on the Google Maps app produced the following listing: Google removed pending edits for a listing’s status shortly after I wrote that article, so now if someone reports you as spam, you don’t have to worry unless the edit actually publishes. 5. Google rolls out the Snack Pack to more industries in the USA Different from the 3-pack, the “Snack Pack” refers to the local layout that that is missing the links to the business website or driving directions; instead of seeing these (useful) buttons, you get an image. For some reason, Google decided earlier this year that all of us who search on Google would love to see pictures of bugs when searching for pest control instead of a website that would tell us more about the company we’re potentially hiring. Mike Blumenthal pointed out that in addition to pest control, jewelers and sporting goods stores also now have this layout. 6. Businesses can now access 18 months of data from Insights inside their Google My Business dashboard In April, Google added bulk insights to the dashboard, which might look unimpressive at first if you don’t catch the fact that you can now select a custom date range for data and aren’t stuck looking at one-week, one-month, or one-quarter intervals! This is a huge plus for agencies who onboard new clients and want the ability to see how their stats look before they start improving things. Tip: Compare data year over year instead of month over month. I find this gives a much more accurate picture of improvement, especially for seasonal businesses. 7. Google starts actively showing local pack ads on mobile I first heard that this AdWords feature was coming last year while at SMX Advanced in Seattle. After tweeting a really blurry picture of the feature, we heard very little from Google about it until I noticed the ads starting to show up everywhere a couple months ago. Here is a picture of what they look like that I took using Mobile Moxie’s Mobile Search Simulator: Notice anything else? Tons of other updates have happened in the last few months, but I wanted to highlight the ones I found got very little coverage that you might have missed. Were there any other major things you noticed that didn’t make the list?

jalopnik Deadspin Fusion Gizmodo Jalopnik Jezebel Kotaku Lifehacker The Root Video Jalopnik Reviews Foxtrot Alpha Black Flag Truck Yeah Lanesplitter The Garage Uber Threatens To Fire The Self-Driving Car Guru At The Center Of Its Fight With Google Ryan FeltonYesterday 3:37pm Filed to: uber anthony levandowski waymo car technology self-driving cars 16 2 Edit Promote Share to Kinja Toggle Conversation tools Go to permalink Photo: AP Uber has threatened to fire the executive at the center of its litigation with Google if he refuses to turn over any files he allegedly stole from the tech giant. The story of how self-driving guru Anthony Levandowski left Google for Uber is a weird, complex tale of alleged theft, a lot of cash and deception. Levandowski abruptly left Google in January 2016 to launch self-driving truck start-up Otto, which was later acquired by Uber for $680 million. It’s a fascinating story—one Jalopnik covered at length back in April. Waymo, Google’s self-driving car project, has accused Levandowski in court of stealing 14,000 autonomous tech design files before leaving the company—and has said Otto was only a ruse designed by Uber to steal its intellectual property. The Engineer In The Google Vs. Uber 'Stolen Tech' Case Might Be An Evil Genius Anthony Levandowski is the key player in the unfolding legal fight between his former employer,…Read more Throughout the litigation, Levandowski has invoked his Fifth Amendment rights in the case to avoid self-incrimination, particularly in refusing to turn over documents. William Alsup, the judge overseeing the case, has referred it to the U.S. Attorney’s Office for a criminal investigation over possible alleged trade secrets theft, the core of Waymo’s accusations. Alsup ordered Levandowski to turn over any documents he might have, has said that Levandowski’s reliance on the Fifth doesn’t prevent Uber from firing him, and has compelled Uber to do whatever it needs to produce the allegedly stolen files. Now, Uber has taken the initial step to do so. Late Thursday, Levandowski’s attorneys filed a motion that asks the judge to tweak his ruling that Uber could can the engineer for leaning on the Fifth. As part of the court filing, Levandowski’s attorneys revealed a letter from Uber’s general counsel, Sally Yoo, in which she implores the engineer to comply with Alsup’s order. Uber's Self-Driving Car Guru Takes a Backseat Amidst Ongoing Lawsuit Over Stolen Tech Travis Kalanick’s “brother from another mother,” Anthony Levandowski, has officially stepped down…Read more “Uber takes its obligations under the Order very seriously, intends to comply fully, and expects you to do the same,” Yoo wrote. (The letter cc’s the company’s CEO Travis Kalanick, who famously courted Levandowski on 10-mile walks and once referred to him as his “brother from another mother.”) Advertisement Advertisement “If you do not agree to comply with all of the requirements set forth herein, or if you fail to comply in a material manner,” it continues, “then Uber will take adverse employment action against you, which may include termination of your employment and such termination would be for Cause.” If Uber does in fact fire Levandowski, it would make for a surprising turn of events. The ride-hailing giant has said Levandowski isn’t a main actor in its efforts to develop a viable LiDAR—a key piece of autonomous driving tech that essentially allows the car to “see”—and has since removed him from the top of the self-driving program. That alone is strange, given the company paid nearly $700 million to acquire Levandowski’s talent and start-up in the first place. Yoo said if Levandowski complies with the request, his employment would continue unabated. Sponsored “For the avoidance of doubt, Uber retains the sole right to determine whether you are in compliance with the requirements set forth above,” she wrote. Interestingly, she explained that Uber still believes no Waymo trade secrets have been used in the development of its self-driving, and that it’ll prevail in court. Nonetheless, she said, if Levandowski has Waymo’s goods, he should turn them over. “Until then, we insist that you do everything in your power to assist us incomplying with the Order,” she said. Attorneys for Levandowski didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. You can check out the motion from Levandowski’s attorneys and the letter from Yoo below.

Android O Developer Preview 2 gets a small bump to OPP2.170420.019, partially fixes Android Pay but isn't installing on many Nexus devices Richard Gao Follow View All Posts 2017/05/18 6:32pm PDTMay 18, 2017 39 Plus 1 on G+ 98 Share on Facebook 47 Share on Twitter Total Shares184 Android O Android OS Google News Nexus 5X Nexus 6P Nexus Player Pixel Pixel XL Android O's second developer preview was only released yesterday, but Google has already released an update for it. We're getting bombarded with tips from readers with Nexus and Pixel devices alike. This update reportedly somewhat fixes Android Pay, which did not open at all on yesterday's version. However, it appears that Nexus devices are having trouble updating. This OTA bumps the version number to OPP2.170420.019 and is weighing in at anywhere between 38.8 and 55.9MB, depending on which Google device you have. One tipster informed us that Pay is no longer throwing him an 'unsupported in this build' message and shows him a normal screen with his cards, but hasn't tested whether they're working or not.   A rare, successful install on a Nexus 6P. While the update seems to be installing just fine on Pixel and Pixel XL devices, a majority of owners with Nexus devices appear to be having some trouble. From what we can tell, units of Nexus 5X and 6P smartphones, as well as the Nexus Player, are throwing errors and showing the dead Android logo in recovery. After a hard reboot, the devices are booting up fine, but they remain on yesterday's OPP2.170420.017 build. One user is claiming that Android Pay has begun working for his 6P, despite the install appearing to fail. However, there are users successfully updating their 6Ps to the 0.019 build. (update: It looks like those who flashed the O factory image are updating without issue, while those who took the OTA from Nougat are struggling. This is due to devices that updated from Nougat via OTA retaining the 7.1.2 build fingerprint. Flashing the factory image and then taking the OTA should get the update to work.) Factory image and OTA downloads are not yet available. An official post in the Android Beta Program Google+ page states that the update will hit all devices currently enrolled in the preview within the next few hours, but given the installation failures that Nexus devices are seeing, it's likely to be halted. We'll update this post with more information when we get it.

Dirge Not the ugly, ugly dots! No! Trooper311 Have not noticed that myself. Tiuri Elvander They never appeared for me in the first place. Do you know which apps support them?? Leroy You have to enable the special permissions, under apps& notifications Maxime Labrecque-Raymond Where exactly? do you have a screenshot ? Tiuri Elvander If I go to Settings > Apps & Notifications > App Info, and select Gmail (because it's often shown to support dots in screenshots), Then I go to App notifications and Badge app icon is switched on, yet none appear. Is there a different setting somewhere that I've missed??? Ah, just saw another reply. It's pixel launcher only :( Laraib Zafar Khan Is the notification dot only for pixel launcher? Tr3ple Yes Daniel Grobe I have pixel launcher on my nexus 5x, the dots dont work for me.. nor does the picture in picture. Dirge Installed fine on my Pixel; Won't install on my Nexus Player. vwnut13 Does Hulu open on your Nexus Player? Dirge I don't use Hulu so I don't know. Kyle Anyone having scrambled audio when playing videos? Usually within Facebook or streamable videos. Julian Berger Yes I have it when playing Youtube videos in chrome maestro PL Installed fine on my 6P. Android Pay enabled OkieDokie This small OTA failed to install for me twice (Nexus 6P) 2 Men-E Thanks for the update on the update... My Nexus 6P and I await good news... vwnut13 Had to revert on my Nexus player, as the update broke Hulu. On second thought, wonder if it has anything to do with my unlocked bootloader... Nexus✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Remember folks this software isn't ready for a daily driver yet. They say so themselves. Consider yourself lucky if your using it and they fix stuff like android pay. Also do not forget to unlock your bootloader if you are using the beta. If you do not unlock the bootloader and the beta on your phone goes south you can not use your computer to fix your phone and restore it. Period. The only fix is to send it in. You can re lock the bootloader after the final stable builds are released. Carson Saldanha Wow, thanks for that second part. Didn't think about that. 👍 Dn Bro I disagree with the bootloader thing. I think if they are sending out fixes to Android Pay, they actually want the bootloaders locked. Also, I would say that at the very least, make sure you go into deveopler settings and allow unlocking. That way, you can at least still unlock your phone if it won't boot. Matty032 Is that the USB Debugging option? ZettabyteGamer I'm using it as my daily and while it has only been one day it has been pretty solid for me. It's in beta, I think it is ready for daily driver use for people who are okay with minor hiccups here and there. Martial Clausse I don't think it's ready yet. Lots of apps are crashing, including inbox and Google search... Joshua Lillis The only app that FC on me is Samsung pay, smooth sailing for me. Martial Clausse Out of curiosity, which device are you using ? And did you update through the OTA or flashed the factory image ? Joshua Lillis I have the pixel XL, I enrolled in the beta program and took two ota, one from nougat to o and then the .019 OTA. SomeGuy112 Seems pretty stable on my Pixel XL. The Pixel performance lead at Google said the Beta is pretty stable on Twitter recently but maybe that's only for the Pixel version. https://mobile.twitter.com/t_murray/status/864927591274127360 Laraib Zafar Khan Apple music is FC too BrandoHD This information isn't correct, you can flash official factory images with a locked bootloader ZettabyteGamer I hope you didn't mean to reply to me, because I never said anything about a bootloader. Joshua Lillis I think he meant to reply to Nexus 2 Men-E I don't use Android Pay, but I do notice the signal will drop for extensive periods of time on my Nexus 6P... Most stuff is running "okay", though... LALO Everything works fine on my Google Pixel. Surprisingly no apps have crashed since I updated. blackeyeX2 On my 6P, I have had more FC's and freezing than I did on the Alpha preview. boop Looks like it comes with the new Assistant features (or maybe I just got them at the same time). Dirge You got them the same time. It is a server side switch. . Carlos Rodríguez The OTA fails because the recovery has an old build fingerprint from 7.1.2, so the installer fails. You can try to install the OTA many times and it will fail. When you get the error, press Power + Volume Up to see the actual error, then you can safely reboot from there. The solution is to sideload the full DP2 OTA from here (https://developer.android.com/preview/download-ota.html ) or the factory image from here (https://developer.android.com/preview/download.html ) and then you can install the small OTA. Cheers! Peter Good work sir. Thanks for the info. Richard Gao Thanks for letting us know. I've added this to the post. Mike Arnett Stupid question: the OTA on my phone to this was 55mb, but the OTA package is 1GB. Is this the full image, and will it wipe all my data? Carlos Rodríguez The full OTA shouldn't wipe the device, make a backup just in case. blackeyeX2 The 55mb one was an update to the full (1GB) released yesterday. bobfrealy Per Carlos R.'s suggestion, after having registered for beta, taking 017 ota, failing with E3001 error on 019 ota, I downloaded and sideloaded the 017 ota. now the 019 system update notification is nowhere to be found. any idea on how to get that back? just wait? meanwhile recover still shows 7.1.2, and Android Pay seems to be running fine. Carlos Rodríguez After some minutes the update should show up. Check for updates. It eventually appeared for me the 3 times it failed to install. bobfrealy yep, it showed back up. and still failed (that's why i mentioned my recovery version, most likely the issue). will likely have to do full image. better to have a full clean install, just a pain with much setup to do afterward. blackeyeX2 Google Pay. My update failed, but Android Pay is now working anyways. Zikaeroh This didn't work for me. After sideloading the update and trying to install the OTA, I get the same error. I'd simply flash just the recovery image from the factory image, but I'm not OEM unlocked. :( Carlos Rodríguez Indeed. The only solution is to unlock the bootloader and flash the DP2 recovery. I guess we're screwed until google does something. Paige Turner I'am freelancing using the web, performing basic jobs that requires from you personal pc or alternatively laptop and additionally internet service access and so I couldn't be more satisfied... 6 months have passed by when i started off this and also i profited up to now overall 36,000 dollars... Basically i profit almost $80/hourly and work for 3 to 4 h everyday.And superb point regarding this work is that you can actually decide when to work yourself as well as for how long and you are compensated at the end of each week.>>>> learn by clicking here how to do it right now Flint_PS 017 OTA sideload doesn't work, I got the error again Fernando Pena So, I decided to start from scratch and flashed the factory image, following updating the .19 OTA. Everything went just fine and I was able to boot the device and restore my backup. Then I started to install/update my apps and noticed that Google App isn't updating, the app keeps refusing to update even downloading the latest APK from apkmirror. It's currently stuck at version 6.16 and this sucks because assistant is not working. Play store doesn't show any updates even if I apply for Google app beta. I don't know what to do, I would appreciate some help... blackeyeX2 The updated images ending 19 are not available yet, the ones posted are still 17. So OTA is only option for now. JC I was getting the same error. It never successfully installed on my nexus 5x. Dn Bro So I did the OTA yesterday on my Nexus 6P, got the Android Pay is unsupported, as was the case. Today, tried this update, it failed, but now when I open the android pay it shows my cards like normal. Not sure if they work, but there you go. Nate Hallett I'm still on the .017 build from yesterday on my Pixel XL, I took the beta OTA and have opened & used Android Pay without a problem. I don't understand why so many people don't have Android Pay enabled on yesterday's build, even with the N Preview they enabled Android Pay so why would it be different this time around? I'm currently waiting for the .019 OTA to finish installing, I'll update my comment with the results. nxtiak I'm on 017 on my XL and I just opened Android Pay and it said it's not enabled in this preview. Installing 019 now. lomsha It's only toward the end that pay was enabled on n previews, not from the start. Frisi Started installing on my Pixel XL. After step 1 was done, it restarted. Still on .017. Thing is, it started step 2 but it hangs here. Andeoid Pay now works, though. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/721d0f338ee7cfe4ff4a19f06d55c9318dd4fa5e7be02f24d9f4befb5eff7b14.png Frisi Well, it started moving after I posted this. I don't know what's causing it to take that long. daburghit It failed for me on a Nexus 5X but I can secondarily confirm that Android Pay works post-failure on the 17 build. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/7c5c1a621e6af03a2092437d0a84552a7cb821509966e5f48c9bdb8ce2a19af5.png Anthony Castanza Android Pay started loading again for me *without* installing this update. It appears to be a server side fix and not directly related to this build. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/bca05de36f641e9afb90773dd4129e37cd5eee46791485bab34ec82e2c423f39.png Chris Thurber Same for me as well except on a 6P! JeffCO Just updated on the XL and Android Pay which was not working earlier now comes up. Haven't tried to use it. Bizziet I was hoping it fixed the now broken MMS issue in messages! Try to add a picture and the whole messages app freezes. Pixel XL on T-mobile. ZettabyteGamer Just updated my XL and when I go to add a new card to Android Pay I get "Android Pay can't be used on this device" So it isnt fixed for me atleast. Lucas Araujo It seems that the update has been pulled. My N5X had the same problem while applying the update and it is not showing in the updates anymore. My Android version still at *.017. Also, after update failure, my google photos app lost its icon and ir showing a generic Android Robot icon. bobfrealy My Photos app icon had this problem immediately after taking 017 ota. reboot; clear cache; etc, re-install app, nothing restored icon. :( doesn't matter now as i'm likely full 017 flashing. blackeyeX2 I disabled the app (which then uninstalled app to original version), then it updated and Icon is back to normal!! Just wiping the cache will not work. blackeyeX2 It's not pulled. It will show up again in your notifications in 30 min, or so. I've tried it a couple of times and each time it reappears after some time. JohnyNoLegs Quality google. Brian Sandoval Not sure if anyone had this issue after update on 6P? I have a hidden network for my wifi and device once updated will no longer connect to it. Ján “Johnny” Valentík This new build fixed for me Google Play Music inside Android Auto on my Pixel XL. In 0.17 I couldn't play any music nor the widget with controls would show... Mattsus The OTA update worked for me this morning(UK time), this is coming directly from an OTA update from Nougat to O Dev Preview 2, can confirm Android Pay now works. neon tiger Have you tried actually using it or just opening the app ? Mattsus I've tried both opening the app, adding new card details as old one expired yesterday, and using it against several terminals. Can confirm no issues thus far. Before update, opening the app wouldn't work but was able to pay using it no problem at all. Joshua Lillis I guess I'm lucky, took the beta OTA from 7.1.2, and now took the .019 OTA just fine. Couldn't flash a factory image if I wanted to, damn Verizon. mieszk3 Nexus 5X 019 OTA: https://android.googleapis.com/packages/ota-api/google_bullhead_bullhead/44bdd4f9967717bad5ef82a54c1dbf2c1ba92fa1.zip Rowan I tried to install it today on my Nexus 6p and a error message came up. I thought it was about to start boot looping but it turned on minutes later to my releif Besnik Rrustemi It worked for me on my Nexus 6P. But maybe it is because i was on 7.1.2 and updated to DP2 the moment they announced it on live Google I/O (0.17 build) and after the first update the 0.19 installed without problem, So maybe the issue is updating directly from 7.1.2 to DP2 0.19 ? jon Hutchinson The update failed on my Nexus 6p. Though android pay began to work. Double edge sword though I'm glad my android pay is restored. I'm still on 0.17. Updated over OTA and even for a factory reset while on Android o. iftekhar bongo my nexus 5x showing error while installing upate... any solution? Leroy This latest build seems to cause problems with safetynet. Stock phones are registered as 'uncertified' in the play store and Android pay doesn't work because the devices are rooted, only they're not.. Small OTA received over the beta factory images on 5X.. Device is marked as uncertified now lol https://www.reddit.com/r/AndroidPreviews/comments/6c0bsg/small_ota_received_over_the_beta_factory_images/ neon tiger Yeah my banking app won't let me use fingerprint login because of this. Leroy Yeah it's really annoying. Hopefully they can fix it on their end without. Would be a shame is we have to reflash 017 build or wait for next OTA to fix it. compuguy1088 Same here on the PixelXL. I'm sure they will update SafetyNet soon enough to fix this. wickets So, next question....when are they fixing PIP?? :) Ernie My Nexus 6p also got an error trying to update from . 17 to. 19 as well. Cache wipe didn't solve the problem either. Any other tricks? Alex Kruger I installed the update via OTA on my Pixel XL, now I can open Android Pay, but I can't add any cards because it thinks my bootloader is unlocked. It's not, I've done everything through the official OTA channel. nextelnutt I received the update and got the dead Android error. However, my build number did indicate .019, then 25 minutes ago, I noticed the update was available again for my 6P. So I downloaded and installed again and device restarted fine. As for Android Pay, I will try it when I am out shopping today. Robert Macdonald Play store now showing as uncertified, Android pay loads but says cannot be used. Otherwise it installed just fine on my pixel. Andreas Constantinides 6p here, got the issue. JoeInMO On my Pixel XL I get "Android Pay can't be used on this device." I'm not rooted or bootloader unlocked. I never had Pay set up before. Matty032 I have the same error. Maxime Labrecque-Raymond Got the issue and my DOTs dosen't work Nexus 6P blacleyeX2 The OTA Nexus 6P failed, but I can confirm that Android Pay is now working and I have used it for a transaction. Not sure how that worked, any ideas? Marty Got the error. 6P. blacleyeX2 The available images are only for the images ending 17 and not the new 19, so we can't side load yet. mieszk3 All of you with unlocked bootloader -> manually flash via fastboot: bootloader, boot, radio and recovery and then 019 OTA will work. (Probably only bootloader is necessary). Marty Firmware not available yet. mieszk3 Use 017 version, then sideload 019 OTA Marty "Factory image and OTA downloads are not yet available." mieszk3 Nexus 5X 017->019 OTA: https://disq.us/url?url=https%3A%2F%2Fandroid.googleapis.com%2Fpackages%2Fota-api%2Fgoogle_bullhead_bullhead%2F44bdd4f9967717bad5ef82a54c1dbf2c1ba92fa1.zip%3AgIXISwZNuhjf2FlMgjO4Va15Lr0&cuid=1370072 Firmwares: https://developer.android.com/preview/download.html Marty I was just contrasting what you said with what the article said. I'm not desperate to update my 6P. I don't use it anymore. Ultra Sage My nexus 5x worked fine for the first few hours. Then when this update came out, I tried installing it but my phone kept on crashing and restarting after every few minutes. It was not bootloop since I could receive calls, but if I opened anything else, then it would crash and restart. I finally managed to use terminal to unlock the boot loader and restore nougat factory image, since the OTA download would stall the screen, and it would restart. I was a beta tester for Nougat, but this was a bad experience. Kris Fannin Same issue with my Nexus 6P. Update fails. Just another data point for you and thanks for the information. ctk4949 I was about to switch back to my Pixel XL from my S8+. But when I tried connecting my Gear S3 watch, it wouldn't open the app. It force closes each time. :( Matt McNair After the update Android Pay will launch but I just tried to pay with it and I get a message stating that my Pixel XL isn't eligible. Had to pull out the ole wallet. StW I tried to apply this update twice on my Nexus 6P but each time the updated failed near the beginning of the install. However, yesterday Android Pay was not working (unsupported developer version message) but today, even though the install failed, Android Pay works. Cael Android Pay works on my Pixel XL after receiving this update. Ernie I think Google might have pulled the . 19 update for the Nexus 6p. I haven't gotten a notification for the update for almost 2 hours now. EnerJi I still have a notification pending on my Nexus 5X. I wonder if that means it's been fixed on the 5X? I've been holding off on trying it until I see some folks confirm that it works for people who OTAd from 7.1.2. Matty032 At first I got the root error with Android pay. But, I cleared cache and then restarted the phone. I was then able to complete the transaction. Works now. That's after Google Chat Support told me it wouldn't work with O. LOL Ian Kumlien 019 ota is up and will apply on a 017 Android O OTA (as in N -> O) phone via ADB sideload Guilherme Noronha Just got the update notification again after failing​ to install this morning. The version is the same, but now it's a 1047MB download. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/9000c49c9403d0d934b43f20e78a43675548972a522f62b370ca9822f5b69643.png Guilherme Noronha Just installed the 1047MB OTA. It installed successfully and build number went up to .019 OkieDokie Awesome news. My 6P is downloading a much bigger .019 OTA as well, this time it is 1053.3 MB so hopefully this one works like it did for your 5X. satyendra karn It is working now. For my Nexus 6P, Installation​ size got changed from 55 mb to 1053.3 mb for build no .019.

I have two Google Homes and I can't wait to take advantage of some of these new features. Lars Jeppesen I am contemplating buying a tv (haven't had one for years) just to use some of the new cool visual features of Home (I have 3 of them). Any recommendations for someone who wants to use it as a casting device and doesn't need a tv tuner (or crappy smart tv features).. just a very good 4k panel without any fuss? James Bryant Hisense make tvs that are considered some of the best you can get for the money. Generally quite affordable too. I believe it's the 7000 series. Lars Jeppesen Thanks, will have a look jonzey231 I got a 55" Vizio E Series on Black Friday with Chromecast Built-In. It's 4K, no HDR, though. There's no tuner so I did have to buy an external one, but that was a blessing in disguise because now I have it running into my TV via HDMI which I like. Got it for like $350-$400ish. Picture is fantastic, especially for what I paid. And I love that even if the TV is off (standby mode), I can just cast something from my phone and it turns the TV on and just starts playing. It's small, but it's convenient. Plus, casting is even in 4K if you're using Netlfix or whatever else with the 4K subscription. Lars Jeppesen Thanks. Is that the tv one of the "all about android" show cast got as well? He likes it a lot. I prefer without a tv tuner as I cut tv signal years ago. Drakenoid That's your best option imo, it works really well. Lars Jeppesen F*uck .. Vizio only sells in the US.. I'm european.. dammit dammit dammit I was getting fired up :) abc Me too. I'll probably pick one up in two to three years when it comes out of beta. Rik Wall The GBoard auto translate feature blew me away personally. Evgany It's been available in beta for months. Rik Wall I think I need to join the beta LOL OrionBeast begs a question, how do you join a beta? (for iOS?). joke: buy android phone. pls. don't downvote <3 Daniel I'M DOWNVOTING RIGHT NOW! JK Pls don't downvote me. Serge Cebrian Downvoting ... Plz dont Downv..... Nah I don't care downvote me into oblivion Just kidding Don't downvote me Drakenoid It's not just in beta. Тарас Мукин It's not an auto-translate, I believe you mixed up 2 different things in one. If you want to translate -- write actual words in one language and get words in other-- you have to press "translate" and type into field inside keyboard -- translated words will appear in main field. But what happens automathicaly is phonetic input -- you write hindi words using english letters, basically transcription. It has to be specific phonetic keyboard layout. The same thing is used in Japanese input for a long time already, as long as their alphabet (kana) is too big to fit in QWERTY-like layout. Paul_Werner Do you know how to have this working now in GBoard? I don't know if it's possible but it'd be nice to test out the transcription feature. I am already on beta and have the translation feature Drakenoid Go into gboard settings>languages you'll find the options there, it should be obvious there. OrionBeast It's good to see Google integrating their services quite nicely. Especially with all the AI features coming along quite well.

Basically i earn profits almost $80/hour and work for three to 4 h on daily basis.And incredible point regarding this work is that you can actually decide when to work on your own and for how long and you get paid by the end of each week.>>>> learn by clicking here how to do it right now Scros97 So.... NO MATERIAL DESIGN WEB CALENDAR? Daniel That's happening in Q4 JG When they were talking about Android Go and she said something along the lines of "While Google Go-ifies our apps, we're opening it up to you, the developers to" I had to laugh... Google has been stressing Material Design as a unified design scheme for how many years now, and they still haven't managed to implement it across all of their properties yet... And that's basically just cosmetic changes. Making a Go app should require a little more work re-designing the app to use less bandwidth and local storage etc. [* and considering how well Allo turned out as a re-design of Hangouts ... but that's another story] Raviteja Rachuri The google lens and Suggested sharing are the things that caught my attention the most.

Name: Subject: Message: Here are the five best things that were announced at Google I/O 2017 Featuresby Nirave Gondhiaby John Callaham10 hours ago 83 6 This week, Mountain View, California played host to the annual Google I/O developer conference. As expected, Google CEO Sundar Pichai and the company’s various development teams made a bunch of announcements on new and upcoming products. There was a lot of buzz about the Google Assistant coming to the iPhone – which is now available – but also about future updates to its Google Home connected speaker and plans to launch stand alone Daydream View VR headsets. Of course, it wouldn’t be a Google I/O without the beta launch of the next Android OS, with the Android O Developer Preview now available for everyone to download. Of course, we don’t recommend doing so on your main device but if you want to install it, you can download Android O here. So what do we think were the five best things to come out of this year’s Google I/O? Read on to see which ones we picked from the conference. Google Assistant on the iPhone launched Google Assistant was first announced at last year’s Google I/O and was made available via Google’s messaging apps such as Allo, before launching on the Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones and the Google Home speaker later in the year. It’s now available on over 100 million Android smartphones, thanks to Google allowing most Android users to download and install it, This week, it was announced that Google Assistant is now also available to iOS users, including Apple’s iPhone, where it will compete with its own Siri digital assistant. Google Assistant on the iPhone brings many of the same features that we know and love about the version on Android, but without the tight integration into the OS. iPhone users finally have a viable alternative to Siri, for those that want one at least, and with developer support, Google Assistant on the iPhone will only get better in time. Google Lens revealed and Google Photos improvements Google is going all out on making smartphone cameras not only better, but smarter. At Google I/O this week, the company announced Google Lens, which will take information from an image on your smartphone camera and, combined with Google Assistant, will be able to use that information for a variety of tasks. For example, you might be able to connect to a Wi-Fi hotspot just by taking a picture of its password, so you don’t have to type that information. If you point your camera at a restaurant, Google Lens will then show you the rating of that restaurant directly in the camera screen. It will be launched sometime later this year. Google also announced some improvements for its Photos app and service. They include Suggested Sharing, which will use machine learning to give you recommendations of which photos should be shared to other people. Shared Library will allow you to automatically create and share images with selected family and friends. Google also showed off technology that will allow anyone to remove obstructions in an image, like a fence. Finally, Google Photos launched Photo Books, a quick and easy way to select photos that can be purchased and printed as a physical book that can be delivered to your doorstep in just a few days. Google Home to add hands-free voice calls and more Google Home launched in December, and the connected speaker is clearly a big focus at the company. At Google I/O, the company announced that it will soon add support for making outgoing hands-free voice calls for US owners. It will allow them to make free calls to any mobile line or landline in the US for free, without the need for a smartphone. This feature will roll out over the next few months. In addition to hands-free voice calls, Google Home will be adding even more features soon. They include the ability for users to schedule calendar appointments with their voice, a way for the speaker to offer time-sensitive notifications on its own and more support for streaming content for many more entertainment services, including Spotify, SoundCloud and Deezer.   Daydream-based standalone VR headsets revealed Google launched its Daydream virtual reality platform around the same time as Android Nougat, but so far only a few phones support using the Daydream View VR handsets. At Google I/O 2017, it was confirmed that Lenovo and HTC will both launch stand alone Daydream headsets that will not require the attachment of a smartphone. The headsets will use the Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor, along with WorldSense positional tracking combined with Google’s own Tango-based tracking technology. Pricing and a release date for these headsets was not revealed this week, but they should be out later this year. Daydream support is also coming to the Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus later this year, along with the next big flagship phone from LG. Daydream itself will get a big software update later this year, which will add, among other things, a way to surf the web in VR with Google’s Chrome browser. Android Go If we had to pick one thing that might actually be the biggest announcement at Google I/O 2017, it might be the reveal of Android Go, This is Google’s new attempt at offering a version of its OS that’s designed to run on lower-end smartphones that will be sold in emerging markets for very low prices. Google tried to do something similar a few years ago with Android One, but without a lot of sales success. However, this new Android Go sounds like it has a better chance of succeeding. Google says that Android Go will be optimized to run on smartphones with 1 GB, or even 512 MB, of RAM. Apps will also be optimized to run on the OS; they will have file sizes of 10 MB or lower. One example of such an app is YouTube Go, which has already launched in India. In order to reduce the use of cellular data, it will let users download videos on a Wi-Fi connection for offline viewing, and will also let users select the video quality of their clips before they decide to stream it. The bad news is that Android Go won’t actually launch until 2018, and we don’t have any word on which phone companies will be a part of the program. However, if Google can make Android Go succeed where Android One could not, it could allow for hundreds of millions of more Android-based smartphones to be sold in markets like India and China. What do you think? Google I/O 2017 is in the history books but we want to know what you think about its latest event. Do you agree with our list of the top five highlights from the conference, or do you have some other announcements and reveals that should be on this list instead?

Ron Amadeo - May 19, 2017 8:40 pm UTC reader comments 21 Share this story The Audi Q8 Concept with Android as the OS. The interior of the Q8 Concept. Audi showed off an all-touch layout. The top screen was the infotainment system, and the bottom screen was dedicated to the HVAC controls. Here's the main screen, and yes that's Android 7.0. Google Maps! Built directly into your car! Also check out the building silhouettes, you don't get that in Android Auto today. Audi's own navigation solution was also present. Pushing the infotainment system to the gauge cluster is one of my favorite features. Google says it's still working on this, and at the demo only Audi's map system could cross over. Believe it or not, this is Spotify. Like Android Auto, Music apps plug into a generic UI template that has been approved by safety committees. Car makers can skin the third-party UI templates to match the rest of the UI, so a single app can look wildly different depending on the car it's running on. For instance, here's the exact same app on Volvo's Android demo. Same app, totally different UIs. Back to Audi, here's the app selection screen. A car settings screen. The Google Assistant. In the front and back were HVAC screens, but these didn't work yet. It's a concept, after all. MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif.—After years of rumors and speculation, Google finally announced a plan to put a Google-blessed, car version of Android in a production vehicle. Audi and Volvo have both signed up to have their "next gen" vehicles powered by Google's OS. Previously we've seen "concept" Android-as-a-car-OS displays from Google in the form of a "stock Android" car OS in a Maserati and an FCA/Google concept for a "skinned android" infotainment system. With Audi and Volvo, the "concepts" are over, and we're finally seeing a work-in-progress product that will actually make it to market. And while previous concepts were quietly shown off with no one willing to comment, Google finally seems ready to talk about how Android in the car will work. First off, there isn't really a name for the project—internally it's called "Android Automotive;" externally it doesn't really have a name other than "Android." This is a little weird since the smartwatch, TV, and IoT variants of Android all have special names to distinguish them from the smartphone UI. In this case, the most obvious name is already taken by Android Auto, a smartphone-based projected car interface. Further ReadingThe state of the car computer: Forget horsepower, we want megahertz!As we've written before, car infotainment systems can be a mess when it comes to shipping modern technology. Android currently ships in several cars, but Google has never been involved before. Any Android car OSes out there today exist because a car manufacturer grabbed the Android source code on their own and reconfigured it into a car operating system, all without Google's help. The result is usually a lot of development time and something that is very out of date when it hits the market. For instance: the current 2017 Honda Accord runs Android as the car OS, but it's version 4.2 Jelly Bean, an OS from 2012. Hyundai is even worse, shipping an Android 2.3 Gingerbread-based system on the 2017 Genesis. With Google's involvement, car manufacturers will ship much newer versions of Android. Both the Volvo and Audi on display were running Android 7.0, with a plan to move the system to Android O once it becomes final. Android O was built with a particular eye toward automotive, with features that will really help car use cases (for instance, it has a quicker startup time). Both cars skinned Google's existing Android code, showing that the car industry will work a lot like the phone industry. Google produces the core software, and OEMs rebrand the interface with their own artwork. On top of the OS, Google provides apps like Google Maps, Google Music, Hangouts, and other messaging services, and OEMs are free to add their own apps to the OS, too. Audi had a weather app and its own navigation system in addition to Google Maps. The app platform here is the same thing you'd get in the smartphone-based Android Auto system. To start, there are only two types of apps: music and messaging, and developers don't get to make their own UIs. Third parties plug into an existing OS-provided UI template that has been approved by various safety committees around the world, providing only an audio feed and icon artwork for an audio app, for instance. There's a big change in the native car OS, though: car makers can also skin the third-party UI template. That means even apps like Audible and Spotify look like native components of the OS, all decorated potentially with a consistent design. Google does its best to fit in, too, clicking Google Maps over to night mode to match the dark UI. On to Volvo, which had a V90 running Android Automotive. This system looks a lot like Volvo's previous infotainment system, just with Android underneath. Google Maps, but in Volvo's funky accordion interface. Volvo couldn't do anything with the gauge cluster yet. HVAC controls. Phone controls. It seems inevitable that Google will have to produce a Play Store for the car some day, since users need a way to load third-party apps onto the system. Google isn't ready to talk about that, and there was no app loading solution on either of the demo cars. Like Android, the possibility of competing, manufacturer branded app stores in addition to the Google Play Store wasn't ruled out, either. Overall, the OS is very closely based on Android Auto, with the addition of HVAC and radio controls. Google Maps was the same interface you'd get in Android Auto, but the Audi version had sweet 3D building silhouettes, similar to the view you can get in a smartphone if you zoom in a lot. Our demo version also had a fully updated Google Assistant, so you could ask Google questions, navigate somewhere, text someone, control smart home features, and more. There were even a few car-specific commands, like one for controlling the HVAC system. One interesting feature that was mentioned was the need for a "garage mode." Today, Android is not really used to being "turned off," and if you turn on an Android phone that has been sitting in a drawer for some time, the first thing it will do is connect to the Internet and download a thousand updates. This slows down a phone considerably, and it would be a terrible experience every time you turned on your car. So in theory, "garage mode" will be a low-power mode upkeep mode that a parked car can occasionally kick into overnight. The idea is a car parked in a garage or driveway would be able to automatically wake up on battery power, connect to Wi-Fi, and download app and system updates. Then when you're ready to use the car, everything will be updated and ready to go. When we did our recent deep dive into the car infotainment market, my favorite interface used the digital gauge cluster for the infotainment system, putting critical information like a map right in front of the driver. Neither of the demo cars could do this with Google Maps. Google said this was something it was working on, but the gauge cluster is usually a separate computer that needs to run a real-time OS for safety reasons (a laggy speedometer is unacceptable), and therefore it can't be Android-based. The company is working on ways to better communicate with the gauge cluster system, though, and the Audi demoed could show Audi's map system in the background—there was no cross over from Google apps yet. The big takeaways here were that both systems proved incredibly snappy and responsive. They have an app platform that, while limited to only music and messaging, can actually work across car manufacturers (which is practically unheard of in the industry). The highlighted plan is to ship a brand new version of Android, instead of something that is five years old. And while Google rightfully gets a lot of criticism for the state of smartphone Android updates, Android's mobile update model is still a lot better than what exists in the car industry right now. If Google keeps it up, QNX might actually have some competition in the car OS space. Ron Amadeo Ron is the Reviews Editor at Ars Technica, where he specializes in Android OS and Google products.

Now, one of the leading forces for the April push has introduced a new bill that could restore some of those restrictions, while adding new ones for web services like Facebook and Google. Titled the BROWSER Act (Balancing the Rights of Web Surfers Equally and Responsibly), the bill requires opt-in consent for the sharing of all sensitive user information, including web histories. But while the FCC rules only had jurisdiction over telecoms, the BROWSER Act’s rules would apply equally to telecoms and web companies, forcing companies like Comcast and Google to play by the same data-sharing rules or face penalty from the FTC. The bill would also prevent lower levels of government from passing stricter privacy rules, a practice that’s already drawn support in some cities and states. Notably, the bill was introduced by Martha Blackburn (R-TN), who also introduced the bill to repeal the FCC rules in April. Blackburn told Axios that her motivation was to bring web companies (also called edge providers) under the same rules as telecoms "What we know is that when people talk about, 'I don't like pop ups that I get, and I don't like this and I don't like that,' that's activity that comes from the edge providers, not the ISPs," the Senator said.

Getty Images Share By Marty Swant| 7 hours ago Share In its bid to make the mobile web faster—and more profitable—Google is adding more capabilities to its accelerated mobile pages to help publishers make more money and users waste less battery power. At its annual I/O developer conference this week, Google unveiled several updates for its AMP (Accelerated Mobile Pages) Ads initiative, including the ability to add video ads, use less battery power and integrate more third-party measurement. Already, since first launching AMP early last year, more than 2 billion AMP pages have been created, according to Google, with an average load time of up to 5 seconds faster than other pages on the internet. Google is also adding new creative formats such as carousels, video parallax and ‘LightBox.’ In a blog post detailing the updates, Vamsee Jasti, a product manager for AMP Project, said the company now allows creative management platform Celtra to support ad creation. “Celtra’s AdCreator platform is already used by thousands of brands and publishers globally to build immersive, rich media ads,” Jasti said. “By integrating support for AMP Ads in this easy-to-use drag-and-drop software for creating ads, all of their customers can now easily create beautiful and fast AMP Ads.” In addition to the new formats, Google’s faster load times allow for less battery usage not only video but also for animated and automated ads. (The company said animated AMP ads drew 80 percent less power than others.) As part of the updated program, Google also is adding third-party accountability through a partnership with analytics platform Moat, which will support AMP Ads in the near future with real-time, multi-platform measurement. The addition could help marketers better understand how ads’ engagement rates improve when they’re faster and lighter. “Attention is the key to branding, and seamless ads and content that load quickly provide a better experience to capture that attention,” Jonah Goodhart, CEO and co-founder of Moat, said in Google’s blog post. “We’ve seen consumers respond negatively when faced with slow load times or a poor user experience. The AMP Ads initiative represents a huge step forward for the industry and consumers, and we’re proud to contribute independent measurement to the AMP Project’s ambitious plans to improve web experiences.” Share http://adweek.it/2q1Pydl copy Marty Swant @martyswant Marty Swant is a staff writer for Adweek.

Netflix was just the start: Google Play Console lets developers exclude app availability for devices that don't pass SafetyNet Rita El Khoury Follow View All Posts 2017/05/18 3:57am PDTMay 18, 2017 93 Plus 1 on G+ 108 Share on Facebook 82 Share on Twitter Total Shares283 Google News Last weekend, a huge turmoil swept the root-enthusiast Android community as it was discovered then confirmed that the Netflix app was being blocked from showing up in search results on the Play Store for rooted devices. At the time, Netflix said it was using Widevine to block unsupported devices, but that made no sense to us: the app was still functional if it was sideloaded, it was only not showing up as compatible in the Play Store. So what sorcery was Netflix really using?! Turns out it's a new function of the Google Play Console. As part of the updates announced for the Play Console at I/O 2017, Google mentions a new Device Catalog section under Release management that lets developers choose with intricate granularity which devices their app supports on the Play Store. Devices can be viewed and excluded by many attributes including RAM and SoC, but the important factor we're interested in is SafetyNet Attestation. New "Device catalog" lets devs manage the exclusions. Developers will be able to choose from 3 states shown in the top image: not excluding devices based on SafetyNet, excluding those that don't pass integrity, or excluding the latter plus those that aren't certified by Google. That means any dev could potentially block their apps from showing and being directly installable in the Play Store on devices that are rooted and/or running a custom ROM, as well as on emulators and uncertified devices (think Meizu and its not-so-legal way of getting Play Services and the Play Store on its phones). This is exactly what many of you were afraid would happen after the Play Store app started surfacing a Device certification status. This is different from the full SafetyNet API implementation that apps like Android Pay and Pokémon Go use. In the case of Pay/Go, the attestation check happens when the app is installed on your phone and doesn't allow it to run unless it passes the integrity test. But in the case of the Play Console, the attestation check happens when you're browsing the Play Store and only affects the availability of the app for your device. If the full SafetyNet API isn't included in the app itself, you will still be able to grab the APK from other sources, install it, and the app will work just fine. Still, this spells trouble for rooted users and the Android enthusiast community as a whole. Google keeps erecting more and more obstacles each day in the face of root and custom ROMs and even if this won't stop root users who should be knowledgable enough to know how/where to grab an APK and install it, it will make things more and more difficult and maybe less and less worth the trouble. But y'all are rebels and you'll keep on finding a way around it, won't you?

Nice move Google. Suicide_Note Not sure if serious, but either way, this was just a matter of time. YouNex Obviously not serious EowynCarter So, question : Is there anyway to get android O in the future on my nexus 6 and not having problems with this ? IF manufacturer where taking care of updating their devices, wouldn't be an issue... saf1927 If Magisk keeps working, yep. You can. Even my old Nexus 5 is on 7.1.2 and it passes SafetyNet. EowynCarter I want "just work" stuff. Not workaround. Maybe Magisk does the job for some, but not an acceptable solution from my point of view. Mainly the "we don't know if it will keep on working" part. saf1927 Well, it's the best solution so far and it has improved a lot since its inception. I never bothered since the Nexus 5 was a secondary device for me, but now that some apps won't show up anymore on the Play Store, I simply flashed Magisk and that's about it. I haven't tweaked anything. Plus, if you are already flashing a custom ROM, flashing an extra zip file isn't that much work anyway. EowynCarter True, but it's the phone I use dailly. I don't want apps sudendly not working, becasue google decided to push an update that broke magisk. mxwp well if you want things to "just work" then i guess get an iPhone EowynCarter Sadly, I'm beginning to think about that. But that would cause others frustrations. ED-Zが現れた! Well, people will just flock to root-supported apps... Milton P. I actually forgot when was the last time I Rooted a device. No biggie. Suicide_Note The bad thing is it isn't just root that causes problems. Simply unlocking the bootloader will produce the same result. Maxr1998 Just because it's no biggie for you, it doesn't mean everyone approves this. I am actually pretty concerned, because this limits the freedom over our devices even more.. Milton P. Define freedom, please. Maxr1998 Software freedom, to be more specific. You should have the freedom to use and modify your device and it's software however you'd like, and have fill control over it. That means, root access. And since the AOSP core IS free software, the 4 freedoms defined by Richard Stallman apply to it. What this change now introduces is that you're forced to decide between either giving up the freedom over your device or not using the app you wanted to download (which will probably have to be my choice, and that sucks). Milton P. But you're not giving up anything, you just have to make a choice. If you put that way, Google has the freedom of doing with the AOSP core whatever they want, the same way you can modify said core and do as you please, the difference is Google has more money and more responsibilities when it comes to their user base. XDA and other sites will still have a bunch of developers making whatever they please (within the AOSP terms) with the AOSP core. This will just change thinks for the people that use those ROMs bit realistically the vast majority of users won't feel the changes. Sad but true. h4rr4r That choice is giving up freedom you had before. The vast majority will see the rate of Android improvements slow as the Devs on XDA and the like lose interest. Android only exists because of Linux, now it is turning its back on that whole culture. Milton P. Well, I don't see your freedom compromised to be honest with you, but we're seeing things from different angles so that's that. Sorry for your loss in that case. h4rr4r You do not think losing control of your device is a loss of freedom? Milton P. Nope, is just a device, I have more important stuff going on, m device is a tool the same way a hammer is a tool, you can buy a hammer and use it as it is. Sometimes my device is a toy, if I buy a remote control car I'll modify it as long as it is possible, the same way I modify my phone. I have control over my phone. I can install whatever I want at my own risk. If I decide to root my phone I expect things to be broken. I remember when I had an HTC and I hated sense so I decided to install a custom ROM, I gave up the camera and I was aware of it. There was always some compromises with custom ROMs, nothing is changing. I rather have a safe device then a compromised one today, still my choice thou. h4rr4r So you want IOS. Got it. Over here I want freedom. I don't think homedepot should be allowed to tell me what I can hit with the hammer I bought. trparky Open platforms rarely stay open once they become popular. Once the Benjamins come rolling in it tends to override open. h4rr4r Tell that to Linus Torvalds. I am sure he will have many many fuck yous for you. trparky Linux is the rare situation. h4rr4r The rare situation like many others that created android and even google. trparky Yeah but look at Android, the walls are closing around it and there's nothing you can do about it. Face it man, the geeks may have built the system but the common man now rules it. Geeks love choice, yes, they do love their choice but your average person doesn't give a rat's ass about choice. All they want is a device that does what they need it to do when they want to do it. They have no inclination to learn how it works or why it works just as long as it does. This is what geeks do not and refuse to understand. h4rr4r Sure there is, stop using it. Then the common folks will have to follow us to the next platform. trparky As long as their is money involved in maintaining Android it doesn't matter if something better comes along, people will continue supporting Android because it makes them money. Money makes the world go round, get used to it. Maxr1998 ^ What @h4rr4r:disqus says. trparky Yep. The root and ROM community is such a small portion of the Android ecosystem that they really don't matter to them. People have been screaming at Google for years to get the Android house fixed up, this is them doing just that. You can't blame them for doing what the people have asked for. mxwp I agree with you, but sadly you only have freedom over hardware. You can do what you want with the device you buy. But with software you never actually buy it... you only buy a license to use it. Thus you have no real freedom with software. Maxr1998 Android is free software, Apache 2.0 license. At least the AOSP part of it. trparky But the Google parts of it are not covered under the Apache 2.0 license. That's essentially why ROM developers can't package the Google Play Services pack with the ROM itself and instead requires you to download a separate ZIP package from Google to install it separate from the ROM package. Android itself may be free and open but the Google Play Services part is not. Sudev There are far more than few arguments against root access but here are some: Root access is meant for experimental & development purpose and not for Daily Driver for any average user of the platform. Google Play Services & Apps available on Play Store are not "Free Software". Google as provider of Play Services infrastructure has much more liabilities then one can simply assume. And also the app developers have responsibility to protect end users' data. If device has root access available and any rouge app / maleware steals other apps data which is possible, who will be at stack? h4rr4r The ability to do anything I want with my things that I own. Milton P. You​ can do whatever you want with your device, nobody is stopping you. You might see that some apps are not showing up in the play store but you can still side load them, I still see freedom in your future. h4rr4r For how much longer? Soon these apps will ask play services if they are supposed to be installed on that device, at that point you can say goodbye to sideloading. If this is what people want then IOS was the platform for them. thecoolkid Ok Google, define freedom... 😁 Nick I would imagine a great deal of people on this site will be upset, but in actuality I don't think this will affect the user base of many apps that badly h4rr4r Not in the short term. However in the long term it will. Android only exists because of the FREE software movement. Nick Yes, but that doesn't apply to applications, which this is about. h4rr4r Think long term. Same thing applies. trparky No it won't because the root and ROM community is so small it doesn't matter to Google anymore. The 95% of people who simply want a device that works don't care and likely won't ever care. As long as they can play NetFlix, Pokemon Go, or whatever is the next craze they don't care. h4rr4r Again, that is short term thinking. Think past the end of your nose. Android exists because of linux. Google needs this small group to create the very stuff they rely on. trparky You overestimate the value that the community has now. Android may have needed the community back in the beginning to gain the foothold that it has in the market but not so anymore. Android has near 100% market penetration, they have achieved world domination. They don't need the community anymore, they have achieved their goals. h4rr4r Until they are unseated. IBM once had a monopoly on computing devices. They did not need the community to gain a foothold, they would not have a product to gain a foothold without the community. Android only exists because of a collection of those projects. trparky No, Android exists because Samsung, HTC, and LG make devices people want and it makes them money by the semi-truck full. The community doesn't mean shit now, all that matters to these companies is one thing... money, money, and more money. Oh, and did I mention money? This is capitalism man, money rules the world. If you don't make money you are dead. h4rr4r Please tell me how that would have happened without linux. Money loses to good engineering every day. Look at how linux killed solaris. trparky Tell me why Windows is the defacto monopoly on the desktop despite the fact that Linux is better in every damn way possible under the hood? That's right... money. h4rr4r Because the desktop is dead. The fight is over. They lost. Even money can't keep them relevant. trparky Oh, you're funny. The desktop is not dead, it will never be dead. When people need to do real work, they sit down at a desktop. When people want to play real games, they sit down at a desktop. When people need to type out anything longer than a page like a college term paper, they sit down at a desktop. The desktop is king and will always be king. Long live the desktop! h4rr4r The Desktop is a dead man walking. When they do real work, they use a Citrix session. When they game they use a console, or they are already nerds. When people type they can use a fucking chromebook. The desktop as you think of it died already. trparky Try and say that shit over at TechPowerUp, HardOCP, Overclock.net, TomsHardware, etc. and trust me when I say this... you'll be run out of town by people with pitchforks and torches. h4rr4r Those are all nerds. Those are the folks who have desktops running 3 different OSes. They are the folks who are pissed about android being locked down. trparky And your point being? You just admitted that only the "nerds" care about Android being open. Sure, those same "nerds" will go off and create a new platform but the rest of the people who are living in the real world and who don't care one damn bit about how it works will continue to use Android. h4rr4r Those people will eventually move to the new platform. Just like they did with Android. trparky And the same thing will happen to that platform in the future that's happening to Android now. Open platforms are nice and all, I'll admit that, but your average person doesn't care one bit. I dare you to go up to any person on the street and ask them anything about Android. What phone do they have? What model? Most will say "I don't know, something that my carrier gave me for cheap." h4rr4r The wheel of computing we call it. It has happened and will happen again. So what? trparky Which reinforces the idea that I said before, eventually all open systems will become closed (or less open) at some point in their life cycle. It usually happens when it becomes popular with the common man. Why? Because like I've been trying to get through your thick skull, the average person doesn't care how any of this stuff works so long as it works. h4rr4r The average person does not matter. Few open systems become closed. AOSP is still fine. trparky What the hell do you mean by "they don't matter"? They're the ones buying the devices, buying the apps, looking at the ads, etc. Just how the fuck does that translate to "they don't matter"? h4rr4r Because they don't. They don't create, they don't cause new things to be created. They are just users, just like I don't matter to how movies are created. trparky But without money from the people who are consuming said things developers won't make new stuff. Developers do have to eat you know and put a roof over their heads. h4rr4r The giant world of FOSS pretty much proves you wrong. Demand cannot create supply. I don't pirate anything kiddo. I have way too much to lose for that. One of those lawsuits I would actually have to pay, since I could. trparky I'll give a hint on how FOSS works a lot of the time. Some of the top tier Linux kernel developers actually work for companies and they just contribute code in their free time. They may work for Intel, AMD, nVidia, or God knows what but only after their day job is done. Why? Because they need money and they need to eat. This is a basic requirement for people in this world. They need money!!! People don't just write code for the love of it, even Linus Torvalds who's in charge of the Linux kernel itself works for the Linux Foundation and yes, he gets paid for his work to the tune of $10 Million a year. Sorry to burst your bubble man but FOSS projects aren't all happy, happy, joy, joy here... people need to be paid real money to be able to eat, drive a car, put a roof over their heads, etc. On second thought, I'm not sorry I burst your bubble! You need it burst! PEOPLE NEED TO BE PAID REAL FUCKING MONEY!!!! h4rr4r No, they get paid to contribute. During the work day. Not as a hobby. Lots of projects are like that. I won't say exactly how I know about that ;) Their employers just aren't as short sighted as you. Linus did not however create linux to get rich. Great code like great art gets created because it must be. People do what they love. Kid, you will get it one day. When you have enough that you aren't worried about it each day, money stops being that big of a deal. Don't worry everybody goes through a phase like you are now. trparky Dude, we are not the Federation of Planets here living in a happy, happy, joy, joy world in which people can just do whatever they want to do without a care in the world. As long as human greed exists there will always be a need for money. And believe you me, greed will never go away unless we breed a new kind of human and I don't see that happening any time soon. Gene Roddenberry's future will never happen, it just won't. Contrary to a lot of geek dreams it just won't. h4rr4r No idea where you got that idea. Never suggested it. My point was the personal relative value of increasing income drops as income goes up. If you make minimum wage doubling your income is a huge deal. Adding the same amount to my income would not get me to take a job I like less. Offering it to Linus would be a waste of time. Yes, some people will keep chasing dollars, they are the exception not the rule. The employers are working on enlightened self interest. Either they use the FOSS product, gain market advantage with direct knowledge, use it for marketing or believe they are getting something else. PostgreSQL for example has a lot of paid contributors who work for companies that either provide customization, consulting or depend on the project. Others just because it increases quality. Commercial software by and large is not high quality. I have seen a lot of it and 90% if you tried to submit it to a FOSS project of any size would get you denied and possibly mocked. This system continues to be more innovative because it is easy to continue to expand. Anyone with a good idea can fork if their idea is not accepted. trparky > My point was the personal relative value of increasing income drops as income goes up. Tell that to the people in Washington or any CEO that demands ever increasing yearly salaries and end of year bonuses all while raping the companies that they work for. Tell that to the psychopaths on Wall Street. For as long as their is money, people will want more of it. Anyone who says that they don't is flat out lying. h4rr4r Those are the exception not the rule. That is why you call them psychopaths. Honestly, correcting for inflation I really don't care that much if I ever make more. Would it be nice sure, would I give up anything I like about my job? No. If you could double my income but it prevented me from contributing to FOSS projects or owning code I generate off the clock, I would not take that deal. If money was enough to make people do anything MS would have offered Linus $11 million a year to not write it. Heck, Sun would have done it while they were still around. trparky Either you're a child that doesn't know how the adult world works or you're a fucking troll. h4rr4r So you have no idea who makes stuff, neat. I guess you think Henry Ford should have made a faster horse. trparky Oh, I know who makes the stuff I use but I also make sure that they are paid! I give money to those developers who write the programs that I enjoy and if I can't pay them I won't use their programs. I only use a program if I can pay for it. I have put money into their tip jars on their web site, I look for PayPal links and I donate even if it's something small like $5. They deserve it! h4rr4r Good for you! There is a lot of great software that does not make money that way. Some even just ask is that you follow the license, like linux which mediatek steals by not releasing kernel source. So I hope you avoid buying that kind of thing. trparky MediaTek controller chips are known to suck so I don't buy them out of that reason alone. h4rr4r Now I have given you another good reason to avoid them. Bunch of thieves. Rita El Khoury I don't even remember when I last bootloader unlocked. But I know this move toward closing the ecosystem further and further will have ripples in the future. The enthusiast community flocked toward Android for its openness and we have custom ROMs and their enterprising devs to thank for HUNDREDS of new features that they implemented first and everyone clamored for and applauded until they became features in AOSP. If Google thinks it can steer this ship alone and it knows best what to do next, we may have less and less interesting features in the future and more and more of what only one entity thinks is best, not a diverse set of opinions. Nick Given that this only gives the developer the option of requiring these checks, it makes me believe that Google had to do this for some companies that have regulatory or other kinds of requirements. Which is a shame for the rooted (and unlocked?) community, but understandable. Shame Google is most likely going to take the blame here in this comment section though. Rita El Khoury Well, maybe they had to, but that won't stop any developer from implementing it without any regulatory or legal requirement pushing them to do so. Nick Right, which puts this choice on the developer, not Google. Google was stuck behind a rock and hard place, perhaps. EowynCarter Well, google is certainly to blame for not planing to update my nexus 6 to android O. And now I can't even use custom rom as plan B without losing some apps :( Suicide_Note Boo hoo. Buy a new phone and quit crying that Google doesn't support phones forever. EowynCarter Fine can you order a pixel XL and ship it to me in France ? Plus, my nexus 6 still works, I hate having to replace working stuff. Makes no sense, economically and ecologically speaking. Suicide_Note I'll sell you my XL when I'm done with it, but only after i get the Pixel XL 2. :) EowynCarter Well, I do hope Google sells the "pixel 2 "( or whatever its name) here. For now, I'm'just hoping my nexus 6 don't break. Else I might jump on the iOS ship. I'm not convinced the the other android alternatives. Note 8 would be the closest, but touchwiiz, delayed updates.... I'm spoiled after a few years with a nexus. Suicide_Note There always eBay or Swappa if you want to get a first gen Pixel. I was looking at prices over the weekend, and mint condition Pixels are going for about $450. EowynCarter Not so much in France. And eBay for suff that cost more that a few bucks, too risky. Plus, the pixel is getting "old" by now. Wilton Daniel Pinto Troll found trparky Yet Microsoft still supports Windows 7 EIGHT YEARS LATER! How come Microsoft can do that yet Google can't? Alex Louderback Actually, that's Qualcomm EowynCarter Source for this ? trparky And Qualcomm can go fuck themselves. Gee... I wonder why they're being hit with an anti-trust lawsuit. Could this be one of many reasons why? trparky Yes, Google is to blame for that. There's no damn reason why your Nexus 6 can't run Android O other than the fact that they just don't want to. Bojan Bunić My bootloader was unlocked prior to changing the mobo on my 5X, courtesy of Booty Loops. Root, well, probably before I got my Nexus 4. Although I'll see how it'll go on in the future, as we don't have Pixels here, so the only near stock possibility is either OnePlus, or some other device and a custom ROM. Milton P. Agree 100% with you, I mean I remember the old days when I hated HTC's Sense, I literally decided that a phone without a camera was better than whatever HTC did back then, but Android has evolved quite a lot nowadays, don't get me wrong, I do believe that custom ROMs did a great job showing Google what the users want but that won't change, as long as someone shows Google what people want Google will keep improving Android, because there's no limits. Now if they go the Apple way and lock EVERYTHING then we'll be fucked, I'm the meantime developers will find a way around the system pushing Google along. Premsuraj An open bootloader and root actually solves a lot of problems still existing in AOSP. The Nougat update absolutely destoryed the battery life of many Nexus 6P devices, with Google only focussing on the Pixels, there was no fix in it. I unlocked, used Franco Kernel + naptime + Greenify and I now I get adequate battery life. Another feature I can think of is theming. Material design is good, but the whiteness is rage inducing Maxr1998 Well, fuck them. Let's just hope not many devs will use this, and Google won't enable this by default anytime soon. Maxr1998 The more I think about this, the more concerned I get. This will reduce the freedom over our devices, and also limit developers in the awesome things they could do before because of Android's openness. I am all in for device security and fighting against malware, trojans and phishing applications, don't understand me wrong, but that doesn't mean that you have to take people away their freedom - just look at how Linux (GNU and Linux) is doing it. Tom Westrick How does this limit developers? If anything it gives them more control. Maxr1998 Fair point, I should have been more specific. With "developers", I meant rom developers and modders, app developers only if they require root access for their apps. "Normal" developers can use this to enforce a "secure" (read: DRM locked-down) environment, but that's not really a good thing in my opinion.. (Refer to my other comments.) trparky You're angry at the wrong people, you should be angry at Hollywood; they're the ones that are demanding this kind of stuff. Their content, their rules; it's how things are in the real world. They have to do what they need to do to protect their investments, plain and simple. We don't necessarily have to like it, hell... we may even hate it, but that's how it is. You want the content? Play by their rules. Colin Richardson If you are an app developer and want your app to run on custom roms..... don't turn on "Requires SafetyNet"... bekifft We are increasingly living in the future Richard Stallman warned us about. With Google taking all these steps, may as well go back to using jailbroken iPhones. Bart Janusz I've already enabled it and I know at least 3 others devs that did it as well. I really don't care about root per se, but custom roms and xposed is source of countless problem as both are buggy as hell. Maxr1998 But in which way does that influence you? Xposed can introduce bugs to the system, sure, but it won't affect the performance of your app unless it itself is modded, so you probably don't have to fear bad reviews for bad performance anyway. And custom roms? LineageOS on my mother's Moto G runs like a champ and much better than the 5.1 stock rom before. And in my experience as a dev, there were much more incompatibilities with Samsung TouchWiz than with AOSP-based custom roms. refthemc I'm sure he's just trying to avoid the headache of emails he gets daily from users who have no idea that it's their fault the app is not working or crashing... Bart Janusz Indeed, not to mention extra crash and ANRs reports which seems to influence app positioning. Maxr1998 But why? The device may behave more buggy at some parts because of Xposed (and mine definitely ran like shit on MM because of some mods, but I NEVER blamed any apps), but the apps itself won't run worse if not modded - normally they should even run better if you only use performance mods like Greenify, NLP Collector wakelock disabler and other light mods. I don't think he gets many reports anyway, considering what @marcusmarcus2:disqus said. Bart Janusz You may not, but many users do, and as I said there are a lot of bogus ANRs and crash reports. Since my app depends heavily on low level OS elements both custom ROMs and xposed are deal breakers (and you really should check source, since I do not update my website as I moved to G+/FB but app has sizable user base given its niche and I'd to deal with ROM/xposed issues fequently). Maxr1998 Well, but the same type of users also give bad reviews etc. without using any mod or root. You generalize modders to only cause problems, and therefore lock out everyone. About your app/website thing: fair point, I didn't look at it yet, and have to apologize for being a little rude. marcusmarcus2 You need to take your own advice, "you really should check source". If you moved to G+/FB, then why does your app on the play store still point to the same website as well. Or at least put a link on the old website that directs to G+/FB. There is nothing that points to your so called G+/FB source. So @Maxr1998:disqus has no other source to check at the moment. Bart Janusz Not that I care but if you try to draw conclusion about app you should probably visit Play Store listing. Anyhow that's really not important I just chimed in to explain why developer will use this. I've choose to do so due to extra burden which in effect hurts majority of my user base, one of my colleagues cited lucky patcher and freedom (which I think is not such a good idea but its his choice). trparky You may not blame the apps because you know better but most people don't understand that, most people see a crashing app and suddenly you see, as the developer, a ton of comments saying that your app sucks. h4rr4r Please do tell us about your apps so we can be sure to avoid them on any devices we have not yet rooted. marcusmarcus2 His disqus profile leads to this website http://artflowstudio.com/ which has a few apps listed. Art oriented apps. There is only 1 update on that website since 2014, so I don't think I would be to concerned about installing one of his apps. Jordan Palmer Nice detective work. Adrian I can see a lot of refund requests coming from people who paid for apps and suddenly are told "Nope. Not for you anymore." A lot of us are rooted and buy apps and you'd better believe noise will be made if an app I use daily, that I paid for, suddenly breaks with an update because it's no longer blessed by the dev to run on my device. It's your app and you can do what you want with it, but there is always another side to the coin. BAlGaInTl That's not the way that Netflix worked it, and I doubt other developers of paid apps would either. I have a OnePlus One, that I run Lineage OS on since the original Cyanogen OS is now defunct and does not receive any updates. Netflix simply doesn't update to v 5+. It still works just fine. I may not get the newest and latest features, but part of that is on me for using a device that is dated. I'm not one of those users who, because I paid for an app once, fells that I should get all of the updates from now until the end of time. That isn't sustainable for developers. It could very well be that Netflix has some new features/offerings in the works in which they are getting pressure from outside sources to push this. A lot of valid reasons for a developer to enable the check exist. As long as they do it in the same manner that Netflix has, I don't see the issue. Adrian And just like Pokemon Go, eventually you'll get a message that you need to upgrade to the latest version or the app won't work, you know, that new version that won't let you actually log into it anymore. We've already seen this happen so let's not pretend that it isn't the next logical step. They aren't going to keep letting people sign in indefinitely with an app that doesn't have the security level they want. It's naive to think that hey I can just stick with the last version that works for root. It takes all of what, the time it takes to create a switch that says minimum version required to log in is "DRM version" BAlGaInTl Good Point. I recognize that. But it seems that the blame (in general) is being directed at Google in many of these posts. If that scenario happens, it isn't Google that blocked you from accessing Netflix. The need for this level of security is on the increase. The same users demanding better security and longer updates are the first ones to cry foul when Google starts laying the groundwork for exactly what they have asked for. Adrian I think there is a way to do both that doesn't piss off a very active community that helped take Android from a very very very ugly, second class OS to what we have now. I know a lot of us remember just how crippled Android was and it was the root/mod community that produced the bulk of what is now standard on Android. There needs to be a way to secure the devices AND not turn their back on the developer community that contributes. The idea, in Netflix's case, that root = pirate is insane. Why in the world would someone prefer to rip content on their phone to say a computer or XBox that is never going to move and can do it while you get on with your life? They're doing something for the sake of saying they're doing something, but if they think it's going to make a dent in piracy they, and the studios are nuts. I watch a lot of Netflix and still prefer to buy discs. People who do things the right way and are perfectly happy paying for content shouldn't have to jump through hoops to watch it. Those of us who root usually have a handful of things that stock Android is not doing for us. It's why we root. If all of these things were available in stock, my reasons for rooting would disappear but I don't see that happening any time soon. I think Android is getting so much better but if they make it exactly like iOS, might as well go to the dark side because Apple's apps tend to be more polished, come out first and OS updates are frequent. Don't bite the hand that feeds you just because you're getting more popular. BAlGaInTl I think that Netflix is a good example. It is HIGHLY likely that the reason for recent unpopular changes (see also VPN blocking) are being driven by other entities. It isn't that Netflix thinks its a problem, but the people that control a large portion of their content do. root pirate but it does introduce a security risk. I don't see how Google is turning their backs on developers. Developers are free to develop as they see fit and choose (at least for the moment) whether or not they will implement the SafetyNet check. The inherent problem is that a circumvented security is still circumvented and can no longer be considered secure. I can clearly see why some apps would and should frown upon that. Maybe not Netflix and Mario (IMHO), but certainly something like bank and payment apps. I don't think the inherent open nature of android will ever reduce to the level of iOS. But some changes have to occur to meet the needs/desire of the majority. Security is inherently difficult. The easier and more flexible you try to make it, the less secure it becomes. Adrian I do think banking apps should run in a secure space. Completely agree with that, but I disagree with root = less secure. My nexus devices stopped getting OS and security updates. Nothing. VERY insecure and dangerous. I rooted them, updated the OS with images from XDA developers and my devices that were once easy targets are more secure. There is always two sides to it. I see that Google is finally trying to take security seriously on Android and doing things in layers that completely cut out the vendor AND the carriers is the right step. Right now, Root is the only way to update a perfectly good device like my Nexus tablet tablet that the vendor said "oh well" to. Until Google has a REAL strategy in place to keep ALL Android devices secure, root will be necessary. Not everyone wants to or can upgrade devices every two years because they get abandoned. My father doesn't need an S8. He does need a device that gets security updates for more than a year after purchasing his phone. BAlGaInTl You are exactly correct, and I'm in the same situation with my OnePlus One. But in working to increase your security level, you leave holes behind. The key words that you used are "more secure." I agree. You are "more secure." But still (probably) less secure than a device that has been thoroughly tested, certified, and passes SafetyNet without hacks. Google has been open that they are working on security updates. They have improved significantly over the last couple years in getting those out. I feel that they are putting in place a real strategy to keep Android devices secure. This is part of that groundwork. I also feel that they are actively looking to replace Android in it's current state, and I can't say I blame them. The only real strategy may be to take lessons learned and start over. Lucky for them, they have the resources to do so. trparky > take lessons learned and start over Pretty much. The worst thing that they did from the very beginning was to allow for the OEMs to do what they wished. Google essentially made a deal with the devil when they released Android to the world. They wrote no requirements into the Android agreements that the OEMs agreed to to require updates to be a necessary thing. Big mistake Google. BAlGaInTl The really needed to in order to get their foot in the door of the market. If it would not have been open source from the beginning, none of the major manufactures would have bought off on it. The fact that they could use it for free (essentially) and still be able to customize on top of it is what sold it. trparky And now look at it, Android is a fucking mess of non-updated insecure devices that are ripe for anyone to be able to take over and turn into a botnet. trparky And you should be raising holy hell with the OEM that made that device! Just because your device is old doesn't mean that it shouldn't still be supported. Windows 7 is nearly eight years old and it still receives Windows Updates. Why can't your device? BAlGaInTl Normally, I would agree, but the OnePlus One is a special case. The OEM operating system is the now defunct Cyanogen OS. I had to balance having the original OS without updates, or running another with updates. The phone is now almost three years old. If I bought a PC with Windows on it three years ago, and Microsoft had since gone out of business, should the PC manufacturer be responsible for providing Windows 7 updates? Even though the PC is beyond it's support date? Sure, I can increase the security by switching to another OS that is updated. It may even be a Windows clone. But if a software developer decided to only support "original, unmodified" PC configurations, that would be within their right. trparky But it can be adapted to run LineageOS. Sudev There is bit difference in analogy here: OnePlus manufactured the phone and Cynogen Inc customized AOSP Android OS for it, they didn't developed it from ground up. I understand that Cynogen INC is out of business now too. However in PC world, it would be the case that you purchased a PC from Dell and get Microsoft Windows OS with some additional Dell software. If Dell or developer of that custom software goes out of business you still get OS update for your PC. Its not android OS itself out business here. Adrian and for the record, I absolutely agree that it was the content providers and not all on Netflix. trparky You should be demanding that OnePlus send an official update to your device. So what if your device is old? It should be still supported. Windows 7 is still supported nearly eight years later, why can't your device be supported for that long as well? Plumplam Who cares except for a bunch of XDA nerds? If it means better security then I'm all for it. Dmitri Smirnov Well, for starters, it doesn't mean better security, since it does nothing to address the problems with vulnerable outdated android versions that will be "certified", but will allow malicious apps to quietly escalate their privileges and do their dirty work, but will block "uncertified" custom roms that actually have all the recent secuirity patches and give user full control over who has root access and how. Also, "bunch of XDA nerds" are the source of a lot of features that had their trial run in custom ROMs and then were adopted to the AOSP. Should I remind you of "The Oak and the Pig" fable? Alienate the developers bringing new ideas to the ecosystem - lose the competetive edge you had over other OSes saf1927 Actually, custom ROMs never really have the latest security patches despite what they claim since kernels aren't maintained and no proprietary blobs is updated anymore. If ROM developers were OEMs, they'd be violating their agreements with Google by bumping the patch level without actually addressing all the vulnerabilities. Dmitri Smirnov Well they patch the AOSP to the same level as latest official one and kernel - if it's possible to do so without breaking the compatibility with compiled blobs or at least on the level of latest official firmware. So in the end run it's at least as secure as the official firmware, often - much more so. saf1927 If you look at the security bulletin, most vulnerabilities come from proprietary drivers and require these to be updated. On a supported device, these are provided by the chip manufacturers to the OEMs, on an unsupported device they aren't updated anymore. A custom ROM can only fix userspace security issues. In the end, bumping the patch level without addressing all vulnerabilities in that patch gives a false sense of security to users. Dmitri Smirnov If anything, this is an argument for forcing OEMs to opensource their blobs. For some reason community is much better at releasing the fixes for what they can change (userspace), while OEMs generally stop caring as soon as device is out the door. saf1927 The problem goes beyond OEMs unfortunately. All the phones you can buy are assembled with off-the-shelf components that they buy from other manufacturers and it is them that provide the binary blobs to the OEMs. If they stop supporting components, the OEMs can't do anything. For the chip, it's companies like Qualcomm, Samsung, Mediatek etc. that need to support it with up-to-date drivers. Once they stop, the life-cycle of a phone comes to an end. trparky And that is probably one of many reason why Qualcomm is facing a nice fat anti-trust lawsuit. Serves them right. trparky That ain't ever going to happen. There's no way they're going to allow for their intellectual property to be open for all the world to see and have it cracked open. It would be corporate suicide since their competitors would be able to reverse engineer their stuff. Suicide_Note Never heard of "The Oak and the Pig" before. Could you tell me more? Seriously. Dmitri Smirnov http://www.aliceswonderland.eu/Alice-ska350-en.html Maxr1998 Ah, Lessing. Going to read the original version in a minute :) username_not_valid Thats a very generous view of the custom ROM community. It might be true of a few, very few devs, but most ROMs are unsupported garbage with serious security issues. Dmitri Smirnov Maybe so, but out of this cesspool of garbage CyanogenMod was born, which became LineageOS. I'd say their quality standard appeals me more than a lot of OEMs. username_not_valid Cyanogen and Lineage was what i had in mind.. Each to his own i guess. BAlGaInTl Yes and no. I run Lineage on my OnePlus One because Cyanogen OS is no longer supported. I can say with certainty that Lineage introduces stability issues that I have to deal with to be up to date. Wilton Daniel Pinto Ninna pooty bewarci Qwip Consider the bigger picture. Right now, users are being shuffled into a situation where they must restrict the control they have over their device if they want to be able to use Netflix (and presumably banking apps will follow soon). That may seem fine, and from some security perspective it is probably a good thing. How much control do you have over your _laptop_? How much do you want? Right now, we're blissfully able to install unsigned software on our computers (although various OSs will complain about it), but will that last? How long will it be before we can only open our banking interface on our laptop using a trusted, digitally signed browser on a machine that is using secure boot and can only run signed binaries? I can understand the direction that Netflix (and others) are coming from, and to them it may even make sense. The question is: what is the cost of ceding control over our devices/machines in order to be able to watch netflix, etc. trparky Yeah and that's why Windows is the virus filled cesspool that it is today. Windows 10 is slowly changing Windows to be an app store based ecosystem in which all apps will be sandboxed. It's coming to the desktop near you. saf1927 I hope Magisk (or other similar mods in the future) keep working, so to prevent this. Not a problem on my Pixel XL since I haven't rooted it, but on my Nexus 5 Magisk allows it to pass Safety Net even though it's running a custom ROM (7.1.2) and it's rooted. Hendrik Leppkes SafetyNets primary purpose is to secure devices for Android Pay, and when you deal with actual money transactions on your device, you really don't want any hack interfering with it - so I'm quite certain they'll do whatever they can to break hacks like this and ensure the security and integrity of the device. h4rr4r No, its primary purpose is to make the device trustworthy for others not the person who paid for it. This is how it makes it "secure" for android pay. You are a possible threat and this closes that. Suicide_Note It would seem that Google is erecting a wall around their garden, too. EowynCarter While Apple opens iOS more and more. YouNex According to the support/help page, a device is not certified if it stops getting Android updates. How fuck up is that ? I don't get it. My Moto X has always been on stock ROM, yet it's showing up as non certified. Yes it's rooted + system modifications, but at no point is it stated that root prevents it from being certified. Suicide_Note Really? You can't understand why your rooted/system modified device is non-certified? YouNex I know how to read, but this is vague https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/b6f710b8628f0e09ab73ba144c133a2c9b1fe1325b353ae7dc1636f2776b2ac0.png "Not secure" jonzey231 Root and/or unlocked bootloader = Not certified. YouNex It says nothing about root or bootloader https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/b6f710b8628f0e09ab73ba144c133a2c9b1fe1325b353ae7dc1636f2776b2ac0.png ast00 Can't wait until LastPass excludes root users... Fuck them. Adonis K. If they do, I'm cancelling my subscription... Naxx ENVY Fuck them and yet they haven't done anything yet ... #internetlogic Also i know right , crazy for a company that stores your passwords to make themselves more secure . ABSOLUTE CRAZY , RAGE RAGE RAGE Jordan Palmer I don't understand your reasoning or rationale for these two statements. ast00 The second part is related to Google. Sorry about the confusion. Believe it or not, most of us root users keep SELinux in it's Enforcing state. This means we are safe. Nothing gets root rights without us knowing. Our phones are just as safe if not safer than most stock phones. JATIN BANSAL SafetyNet test can be passed using Magisk Manager. I am using it and it works fine for me. Even in play store, my device is certified. May be this helps someone. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/3756499ff5876545740cd0e88e38961bb2c327d90fc43f5801f4bce5d802c990.png https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/44185f640490cb506a68a3414579bd345123f7d52ee2e11802d31d5141db11ae.png Nick Most people are worried about the future when the exploits that Magisk uses are patched and it continues to make it harder for people to get around this. JATIN BANSAL That's what I am also worried about. I just posted this for those who are already rooted and for now want to keep the root. My main purpose of rooting was to flash lineage OS. I think custom rom is the only way of staying updated to latest version of Android as google itself doesn't update their phones after 2 years (18 months I think) for reasons they have. I think if someone buys a flagship device which costs 700$+, it should have 3-4 years of full software update support. 😆😄 2 years of major OS version updates and 3 years of security patches. After 3 years, its time to buy a new phone cuz its so old anyway. trparky Says you! Windows 7 was released on July 22, 2009 and they still support it EIGHT YEARS LATER! And they plan on supporting it until the year 2020 which means it will be supported for a total of ELEVEN YEARS! If Microsoft can do it, Google can too!!! Does Microsoft suddenly say "Your machine is too old, go buy a new one"? No, they continue to give you Windows Updates for years later. We should also be demanding that the Android OEMs do so as well. A Samsung Note 5 has more than enough hardware in it to run Android 7 but no... we can't do that, we need to make money so we don't update them to force you to buy a new device. Lambdadelta Magisk...alright, thanks for the tip-off. I really must get it. TadMSTR Magisk doesn't always pass SafetyNet. I have some devices it fails on. However, several other devices it works just fine. Make sure you turn on the hide root option, it's off by default. Lambdadelta Well, I do have a problem, and that is my device is not able to download it directly from Google Play, so I have to get the APK from XDA. I dunno why this is the case for my phone though. Is it because it's a 4.4.4? Either way, I'll get the APK moved to my phone later tonight. Teodor Axel Johan Jönsson I have activated hide root option, and it passes SafetyNet, but in Google Play Store, it still shows uncertified. What app should I hide root from to get Play Store to show Certified? JATIN BANSAL As per XDA: Q: Safety Net fails after enabling MagiskHide A: Magisk can only hide Magisk core features, for Magisk modules it depends on what the module does. If your ROM itself is not able to pass SafetyNet, then there is nothing Magisk can help. Your best bet is 100% stock ROMs, because your phone manufacturer is forced to release a device passing CTS. Teodor Axel Johan Jönsson What in Magisk Hide did you check/how did you do it? Google Play Store? Or Play services? Because here it says uncertified :( JATIN BANSAL Just clear app data of play store. Now it will show your device certified Teodor Axel Johan Jönsson Thanks! Muzaffar I believe that root and custom rom makes android what it is now. This feels like betrayal for Android enthusiast. username_not_valid Well maybe in the very early days (maybe), but not any more. Rooted phones make up a tiny fraction of active devices. Muzaffar It's not about active devices. It's about how android develop together with community (well as i remember) I believe that those "rooted user" contribute many things that make android right now. I still remember status bar (and nav bar) color change was implemented on Kitkat before it becomes official on lollipop. Also, we can't forget how badly mobile active network bug happens in lollipop if it's not those "rooted user" who found out the fix via xposed. and i believe there are still more. trparky We can blame the OEMs for that kind of stuff because of things like locked bootloaders, eFuses, etc. username_not_valid Or we can blame ROM makers for it because they kept breaking the devices causing warranty claims. Naxx ENVY no offence but that's small thinking ... i'd say 90% of people on Android devices don't want or even know about root, heck it may even be 95% ... security is more of a concern, sure it annoys us geeks, but that's the 5% at most. Muzaffar And about half of android devices is left outdated. Not to mention bugs that unsolved on previous android. I'll pick a dumb phone instead, if android becomes a closed platform. trparky And truth be told that's why I have an iPhone. I simply got sick and tired of the lack of updates so I told myself I'm going to the iPhone and have been happy ever since. OK sure, it may not have all of the customization features that Android has but I can be guaranteed that I will get software and security updates on time, every time, regardless of my carrier of choice. refthemc I think you misread his comment, he's saying that root and custom roms got Android to where it is TODAY not saying that it is necessary TODAY. And I agree. trparky It pretty much comes down to this. Google is simply targeting a much larger piece of the pie. You can't blame them for trying to do what is necessary to protect not only the platform but the Android brand itself. Qwip Well, it isn't like there is anywhere else to go though, is it? Google can basically throw enthusiasts who have promoted and fostered android development under the bus - they don't need them any more. trparky Money trumps community. Always has, always will. username_not_valid Ad blocking was the last holdout reason to root for me, but even thats no longer a good reason with things like Adhell, Adguard etc I have no other reason to root now, custom ROMs are generally garbage, and bloat can usually be uninstalled or disabled, so its just not needed. Adonis K. custom ROMs have nothing to do with root... thevigilante Custom ROMs have uncertified flag in Play Store Mike Avellanosa Not all, though George Byers My Nexus 7 2013 is passing safteynet running Lineage unrooted. Wilton Daniel Pinto Let me guess, you have a Pixel. Or you wouldn't call custom ROMs bloated while the reality is other way round username_not_valid Wouldn't touch a Pixel actually. username_not_valid Should be noted that I didn't call custom ROMs bloated, I guess you misread it. Wilton Daniel Pinto Oh yeah, I misread it . My bad Zach Mauch This is going to cause the same problem I see in governments work with security. They will blindly block things like root and bootloader unlock regardless of if it poses any credible threat because it FEELS more secure. Blah!!!!!! Naxx ENVY it IS more secure, not just " feels" h4rr4r More secure for them, not for me the owner of the device. Besides, not even for them in the long term. An up to date ROM has many exploits patched that a two versions out of date and 12 months behind on security patches OTA has. Zach Mauch What I mean is they will apply restrictions because they easily can and it gives a warm fuzzy for them. They will do this regardless of the impact to the user. The analogy here is that in my job I am constantly unnecessary restrictions and bureaucracy that make doing my job much more difficult. For instance, we are disallowed from using remote desktop on standalone computer networks. It would make our job MUCH MUCH easier in many circumstances and save money on software as I could remote into my PC from anywhere in the building. Yet they deny us that and claim security. jonzey231 So this will force people to install apps from unauthorized sources, thus making the whole Android malware issue that much more prevalent. Great.. Suicide_Note Unless being held at gunpoint, no one is forced to install apps from unauthorized sources. That's a user's CHOICE. jonzey231 You know what I mean. Stop playing devil's advocate on everyone's posts. Eric Braun He's not incorrect. Kyle R Krcmaric "Stop providing an alternate viewpoint to my own." It's just comments. Anyway, I think Google also announced that even sideloaded apps will get scanned by their new Google Play Protect service, which may help nullify the risk of sideloading in the first place. d0x360 That's not an alternate viewpoint unless your view is "don't install any apps ever" There is no logical argument to defend this move by Google. None. username_not_valid Yes there is. Come content creators will not allow a provider to support a rooted or otherwise compromised device. Right or wrong in your eyes thats the reality, and in order for Android to be able to have such services Google have to do this. d0x360 What you said isn't an alternate viewpoint lol you are just repeating the reason Google is doing this which everyone agrees is a fact. As for this new comment...a rooted phone isn't compromised. Tell me...what would a rooted user do with Netflix that would make Netflix want to block them? Are they worried about people copying movies because if they think Android is the vector for that action they are idiots. All they are doing is making a problem by allowing bad actors to inject malware into a Netflix apk that could be installed by both root and unrooted users. Genius! Give me 1 good reason to block rooted phones from an app like oh I dunno, Mario run or whatever it's called. Any answers you give are false. Wanna know why? Hacked apks exist to allow cheating and they can be installed by anyone rooted or not. In fact I'd stake my life that your average unrooted user is installing more modified apk files to cheat in games or whatever than any rooted user. People who root are generally better educated about the Android eco system and do less dumb stuff. As for Netflix I cancelled my account on the day they did this and now I just use a friends account so they lost a subscriber due to this move and I rarely ever used the app. Sure 1 person closing an account that's existed since the day they opened isn't going to do much but I vote with my wallet and if a company does something I dislike then they simply don't get my money. The first person I asked gave me their login info and I made a profile. It's just like how I share my HBO subscription with someone else. Easy easy. username_not_valid See my previous comment. Its not for me to argue, the fact is content providers want it, fair or not, end of story, therefore its going to happen. The tiny number of rooters out there are meaningless to them, and Google. Netflix has to do this because the providers of its non-original content demand it. Its not Netflix fault, they either do it or lose shows. Losing large amounts of their content would affect their subscription base several orders of magnitude more than losing rooted users, who chances are, use the service on more than their phone or tablet anyway. d0x360 Once again I ask... what about a rooted device is dangerous to an app and also this is now a second question, what makes it compromised? BAlGaInTl Clearly you've made up your mind on the issue, but I'll give it a go. It isn't necessarily the root that is dangerous to an app or vice versa. The compromise comes from other apps/processes that can take advantage of root. If you don't understand that, then you don't understand what root really is. It has a lot of valuable uses, but it can also be dangerous. To address your previous statement, just because it rubs me the wrong way. So your "solution" was to cancel your Netflix account and then steal the content? So clearly, you aren't "actually" affected by the change, because you can still watch Netflix. You do realize that watching their content is also valuable to them and makes them money? If you want to boycott Netflix for their practices, then by all means do. Otherwise, it just comes across as hypocritical IMHO. d0x360 I don't believe I asked you. No I'm not stealing Netflix content, it's being paid for and Netflix has many times in the past encouraged account sharing. Of course they did so in the hopes you would join but they still allow it. I paid my Netflix dues. Day 1 4 disc member, then as soon as it was available I upgraded to the 4k 4 user package. It's not piracy either, I'm not recording or distributing the content. If Netflix wants to dick with me I'll dick with them. I never said this was permanent but I vote with my wallet. Vote cast. I also haven't used Netflix once since that day despite being able to. I've been using Amazon and Microsoft video where I own over 500 movies so you can stuff the whole theft argument. I've bought more content than most and that doesn't include my DVD, Blu-ray, and uhd Blu-ray collection which is well over 1400 movies and TV shows at this point. Your right...I've been rooting since the first Android phone but I totally don't understand the possibilities. My argument is simple. The overwhelming majority of root users don't mess with apps. To hell with that nonsense argument anyways. What is the danger to Netflix? Copying movies? Please...it's a million times easier to do it on a PC. Even windows xp can handle it without issue. Does Netflix and you I suppose really think root users are using the app to steal content? If so how? Show me one forum topic, one article, one modified Netflix apk that allows downloading and bypassing their drm. I'm begging you. Just 1. BAlGaInTl I reviewed the Netflix TOS, and I will agree that you are not stealing. I'll even remove the verbiage from my post. Netflix does not make any such stipulation. They speak only of the "Account Owner" and "Devices." I guess I just assumed that, and that's my bad. As I've said in other posts... It isn't all about Netflix. A large part of it is about their content. They really can't argue that point with providers. You either play by their rules, work to establish new rules, or choose not to carry them. Netflix wants to stay relevant on all platforms. That's the main danger to Netflix. In addition, I shouldn't have to give an example in the wild of an exploit. Just because it is difficult to find doesn't mean it doesn't exist. What if someone else writes an app that uses root to mine user account data from Netflix? Should Netflix not be worried about protecting user data? If that happens, who is responsible for the security and the bad press? Probably not Netflix, but they would certainly be impacted. I checked my app really quick (which is stuck on version 4 because I'm affected). Since Netflix keeps you logged in for convenience (that's spelled out in their terms), a quick look gives my full name, username, phone number, zip code, the brand of payment card, and the last 4 digits of that card. That's quite a bit of information that can easily be gathered by a piece of Malware. Now as I said... Netflix probably wouldn't be liable if a user was compromised because of root. It would certainly be a danger to their business however. Why should the be asked to take that risk? It seems to me that they are approaching this in a realistic manner, and rolling it out in a reasonable way. Would this affect the majority of root users? Probably not. By their nature, root users will find ways around it anyway. The problem is that the impact to Netflix from losing content and/or a compromised app is disproportionate the loss of blocking root users. It's simply a numbers game, and you can't blame Netflix for that. And you certainly can't blame Google who is trying to improve security. username_not_valid Thats not for me to decide, or argue, the fact is the content providers have decided that rooting is a risk to their copyrighted content, and as such services like Netflix, Amazon, and other streaming services must comply and lock out rooted devices. Passing safetynet and using Googles DRM framework is the easiest way to claim due diligence, so thats what they will do, and in order to keep Android competitive Google is providing the tools needed to make it possible. What I will argue though is that your notion that custom ROMs etc are more secure is unfounded. The best might well be, but there are hundreds of completely random and unchecked ROMs out there that could contain absolutely anything, you cant possibly claim that custom ROMs are inherently safer or more secure than OEM ROMs, outdated or not. jonzey231 So let's play this out: If someone takes the Netflix .apk and mods it with malware and then signs it, it will pass installation on the device. 1. User opens app. 2. App does whatever shitty thing it's designed to do while the user thinks they just got around the block. 3. The OS scans the app and warns the user it's been modified and they should uninstall it. 4. User thinks "Ha! I know and that's why it works!" 5. User keeps app until they get a call from Credit Karma that their identity was probably stolen but they don't know how. 6. Person spends 6 months fixing stolen identity. But still uses that app the whole time. Ultimately, that user is still going to be screwed. Would you or I make this mistake? No. Would your cousin's friend's dad because he had his son root so he could tether for free and overheard you guys talking about sideloading apps and googled how to do it? Yes. Randroid Problem is, even in your scenario, root has nothing to do with it. Someone who is not rooted could do the same thing. The only problem is, now MORE people who root are going to be *forced* to look for a modified apk because the official apk is not available from the Play Store. So in the end, it's causing more problems than it's fixing. Corbin Baxter Here's the thing about rooting: when you alter your devices software like that, then Google shouldn't be responsible for anything that comes afterwards for the user. This just helps discourage rooting, which can alter a new users perspective on Android, or make someone reconsider getting an Android device. someone755 For what it's worth, back in 2011/2010, many of us bought into Android *because* we could root. Imagine the possibilities of being in control of so much more of your system than with any mobile OS prior; We've spent hundreds (some, thousands) of dollars in this environment, on devices, apps, books etc. I understand this isn't how things stand nowadays, but root is still prevalent because of one issue that Google will not fix (or at least, won't until O+ is running on the majority of devices, but that'll take two years at the minimum), and those are updates and vendor apps (i.e. bloatware). If my phone is stuck on Lollipop I'm going to root it; I'll be able to mitigate the memory leak performance drops, and overall customize the device to fit my specific needs -- I've made quite a few friends (think ROM and kernel devs) because I just wanted to put a thermal engine better than Qualcomm's horrendous MPDecision into the kernel directly (i.e. I took the kernel source and modified it to fit my needs). What Google is trying to do here is, yes, discourage rooting, but instead of fixing the root cause (heh) behind why people root in the first place (that is, again, customizability and personal(ized) performance tuning, in large part to keep devices on older Android versions alive), root wouldn't be necessary. In the long run this *might* fix the symptom, but it most definitely will not help in fixing the cause. And that's because the cause is Google itself. As if apps like Snapchat blocking power users from their apps wasn't enough, now there's this -- If it becomes so common that even Google's own apps start to utilize the feature, I'll be gone to another mobile platform within a month. That might mean iOS, it might mean S60v3, I'll know that if (or rather, when) it happens. tl;dr: Google is putting a band-aid on a shotgun wound. Corbin Baxter I'm speaking mainly for new Android users. They don't feel as comfortable rooting. Doing this makes Android SEEM more like iOS. This doesn't MAKE Android like iOS. New users are comfortable with that. This is the same issue Microsoft had with Windows 8/8.1. Classic users, and Windows enthusiasts, hated someone changing the way they would use their computers. Microsoft introduced a different way of doing things, and to enthusiasts, it was bad, no matter how good it might be. Google's Project Treble should mostly fix the fragmentation problem, therefore giving Android users one less reason to root. To us enthusiasts, nothing can beat rooting, but it might not be the best solution to the problems Android has. Google seems intent on fixing the problems rooting tries to solve, but in a higher-quality and reliable way. No hard feelings😉 trparky They won't understand that, they're too blinded by their geek rose colored glasses. Corbin Baxter I don't expect everyone to understand, but I'll be happy if even a small handful understand what Google is doing here. Dmitri Smirnov > when you alter your devices software like that, then Google shouldn't be responsible for anything that comes afterwards for the user. As if right now Google or the OEMs are in any ways responsible for the malware or unpatched firmware vulnerabilities that stay this way for year. But yes, the users that root are the problem. Corbin Baxter For unrooted phones, yes Google and OEMs are very responsible. But after you root, Android loses most of its security and stability, and rooting is basically tinkering with core system files. Google doesn't have any control over what the user can or can't do after that. bekifft That wasn't even a devil's advocate, that was a straight up strawman. Frosted Butts Yes.. please tell me about all the Netflix alternatives i can install, that can legally stream from Netflix...... Right now, if i am rooted and want Netflix (a service i am paying for), i must go through 3rd party app stores to install the APK. There is no choice at all... R Firestone ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ Umm you have the choice to unroot your device. Maxr1998 ..which is a bad choice for many. d0x360 Yes you do except I rooted my device to make it MORE secure. Unrooting would make my device less secure than sideloading apps would. username_not_valid People can keep saying that, but the content providers have no way to know whether or not you have taken measures to secure your custom device, whereas if they go down this root they know its handled. BAlGaInTl "whereas if they go down this root they know its handled" I see what you did there. 😆😄 ...or just watch Netflix from Chrome! You could even do this from a Linux box with root! 😃 Suicide_Note Sure there is: unroot. Problem solved. neoKushan "I've solved this problem by creating 3 more problems - but it IS solved!" Eric Braun https://www.amazon.com/Netflix-Inc/dp/B005ZXWMUS Option C .. ?? h4rr4r A choice that is now more popular. dcdttu It's not so much about what a user chooses to do. It's about probability. The probability that sites are going to try to lure users into downloading malware-infected Netflix APKs from 3rd party sites is going to go up if you can't download it from a safe source in the first place. This is just like the fact that, if you don't give drug users a safe and clean place to shoot up, they're going to go do it somewhere else that's much more dangerous. Both of these scenarios are bad for society in general, no matter what the original intention was. kgptzac 1/10. Gotta try harder. Premsuraj How? Google Play Protect will still catch malicious apps makapav Yes but you're potentially making people venture through shady sites to get the APKs. Eric Braun Or to Amazons App store or Fdroid. The people going to shady sites are already going there, this isn't going to increase the traffic by any real amount. tehboogieman Are you sure that Google will continue allowing GPP for unlocked or rooted users going forward? Not to mention that it's not a silver bullet for 0days d0x360 It barely works as is. There are tons of apps that slip through every day. Krebs on security reports on them quite frequently. I don't trust Google's scanning of apps at all which is why I root. I can make my phone more secure and I can also image the device as often as I want so if something does happen it's fixed within 5 min. If I unroot then I lose the protection along with the backups. Premsuraj Custom ROMs and root can't protect from 0days either. And just out of curiosity how is root going to provide more security? If anything it makes the device less secure tehboogieman Nobody said root makes a device more secure. Blocking root users from downloading apps from the Play Store puts users at more risk since those users will be more inclined to sideload apps from sources that might not be as reliable as the Play Store. Premsuraj The only people who cares about this are the people who root. And those user's generally tend to be more knowledgeable about what kind of apps and app stores they can trust. ASYOUTHIA✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ And only <2% of users will do this to keep rooted. xxTheGoDxx Only the plus 50 - 100 Million users that have root: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=eu.chainfire.supersu ASYOUTHIA✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ You do realize that that's just downloads right? ...not active users. blindexecutioner I'm not mad. I continue to use things like magisk to help get around stuff like this. All this will do is encourage me to use unauthorized sources for offending apps if magisk ever stops working. There is a reason I use Android over iOS and it certainly isn't because the apps are better designed or whatever. brian. Magisk is a good way around this. However, I don't know how long this will last. I would think with security in mind and developers trying to monetize more, it will put pressure on Google to make SafetyNet get triggered much easier. Obviously, I don't have any way of knowing, but this could easily turn into a cat and mouse game more than it already is. Android Pay was first, other apps did it like Super Mario Run, which who cares, but now Netflix? Changes are coming, and it doesn't look good for the rooting community. D13H4RD2L1V3 I'm not sure if everyone gets why some of us went through the trouble of gaining SU access. Sure, maybe there's a few who went through all that trouble for nefarious purposes (and maybe that got regulatory bodies concerned to the point where Google even needed to consider this) but from my perspective at least, a lot of us gain Superuser access mainly to get features that we liked on other Android flavors, especially in the case of a build of Android that's very close to Google's vision. Such as the ability to hide the navbar at any time we wanted and also to gain theming support (which I feel should be added officially sooner rather than later because I absolutely hate how Google is making their already-bright UI even more eye-searing with even more white-colored elements, which also makes the benefits of OLED much less obvious). I wouldn't be as concerned if these features were pushed to AOSP soon, but as it stands, I feel that Google should probably think about making these features available soon. Marty Thank the bad apples for why you no longer have freedom. Jeremy ディリマ Would changing region firmware with Odin flag the SafetyNet check on Samsung mobiles? Soz if it's a stupid question a lot has changed since I last fiddled with Android Christopher Robert This was a long time coming. Once root user started using root to pirate software, and/or get around geo locks, instead of using it to add feature to their firmware or improve their devices performance, it was only a matter of time before it all got torn down. h4rr4r Get around geo locks? You mean have my device report the location I want it to report? Yeah, how terrible that I control what my computer does. dizel123 You still do. This doesn't affect that at all h4rr4r You said the justification for that was people using their devices for their own reasons in the way they liked. I was pointing out that this is a normal thing and not something that should be punished. Cuvis You don't need root to pirate. You never did. Marty Apple says, Thank you. h4rr4r Sounds like we need a new FREE platform. Maybe Amazon can use this to push their store. mxwp but will the Netflix from the Amazon App Store work on rooted phones? Curt RIP Root. I'm not moving from stock anymore, just cab with the hassle. Until there's a 'reliable' way to hide from Safety Net, I'll enjoy my Android Pay, banking apps and overall smoothness. (If it was up to me, I'd be rooted with Linage) h4rr4r IOS is the platform for you. That was the deal from the beginning. hp-fourtwenty magisk....giyf .y phone is rooted with lineage 14.1, and passes safetynet. problem solved! jcopernicus Fantastic news. Lawstorant All this butthurt for what? You all sound like Magisk doesn't exist. Dave Hamilton Lets take Apple and there closed source. Lets take Google and there open source, the freedom to do and change as you please to make the device yours. No two devices have to be the same. Lets get 115 million android users, and then start deciding you no longer have this choice and freedom to do what you want! When something gets better and better, its only a matter of time before all the things you love are removed and comersilised Eric Braun You still have the option to do what you want. However like everything there are reactions for every action. Want to root or unlock your device? Sure, however there may be a few apps that no longer appear in the playstore. May want to have a backup like Amazon App Store or something similar ready. No one is stopping you, feel free to do as you please. tehboogieman Man, if I have to choose between having a device with root or a device with apps that use day to day, the iPhone goes from a 1% chance of being my daily driver to about 50% There are still a lot that can Android can do that iOS can't, but if I'm living in a walled garden the iPhone is looking pretty attractive. 5+ years of official OS support, solid retail network for quick service or hardware exchanges. The Play Store is my main source of apps that I know are vetted and generally safe. I have no desire to manage app updates manually. There is always a chance that someone will build and maintain an appstore that will have all root blocked apps (maybe the future of APKMirror?). If not it might be the death of Android for users like me Eric Braun Even without all of this I would use an APKMirror App that allowed for updating of apps automatically. dizel123 Google gives app developers more control over their apps. Whiny entitled internet crybabies go on the internet and whine and cry. Aka...Thursday neoKushan Alternatively: Google restricts users from using their device, which they own, how they see fit. dizel123 Except Google isn't restricting anyone from doing anything. But being 100% wrong has never stopped anyone in the internet NubCake being an asshole (in your case) hasn't stopped anyone from commenting eather it seems. dizel123 I can admit to being an asshole. But I'm also right so it's all good. neoKushan It's certainly not stopping you. dizel123 I haven't experienced it so of course it's not stopping me trparky You may own the hardware but you don't own the software, you only have a license to use it. Csöpi Thats so greate. I have a stock oneplus one and for some strange reasons i was failing the test beforhand, but now its all green. Still cant update the netflix app hence chromecast isnt working either anymore. Not really happy. JC If there's a will there's a way. brian. If more developers get on board with this, I can't see why I would switch to Android. I've always been curious about new Android phones, bought a bunch and rooted them all if I could. This is not good for a person like me. d0x360 If Google keeps this up and app devs include the api to block rooted phones then my days using Android will be over and Google will have lost a user who's been there since the g1. I don't know what I'd switch to... probably windows mobile because I'm not a fan of apple whatsoever. It's really a shame because if I had to guess I'd say 99.99% of people who root do so for either the added security and or customized experiences. For example I use root to modify my status bar and quick panel as well as firewall my apps and use adaway and yes Google I do whitelist sites that aren't obnoxious with their ads. John Doe All the more reason for the APK mirror appstore LoL Jan-Lk Else Yeah Google want's us to buy tooooo expensive phones to just get the latest Android, because cheap phones suck at updates and so they need to be flashed and rooted... trparky But if the community raises holy hell with the OEMs then maybe it will be corrected. There's no damn reason why a three year old device can't be updated when an eight year old Windows 7 machine is still receiving Windows Updates. McStagger WHY DOES NETFLIX CARE IF THE PHONE IS ROOTED?!?!?!?! mxwp Netflix does not care, but the content creators that make the stuff you see on Netflix do care. They care because they are idiots who think it is easier to pirate from rooted phones. bekifft Again, Google becomes more and more restrictive. I switched from iPhone because the screens were too small, and Google was far less restrictive. Both of those issues are now resolved, and Google's upped the price of their device to match Apple. May as well switch back to iPhone, Google seems to support it just as much as Android anyway. Luxferro Except it's not just rooted users! Any device with an unlocked bootloader. hp-fourtwenty Your comment sucks for misinforming users about what safetynet is....has NOTHING to do with unlocked bootloaders. Luxferro Sure it does. My Nexus 6P only has an unlocked bootloader, and Netflix disappeared from the play store after the last update. And I'm not the only one, so I suggest you do some reading. TechGuy22 more reason for me to pirate hey, have at it Matías Duarte I hope Netflix does the same with Jailbroken iOS devices. Why they do this btw? To prevent people recording their movies? You can do that with Windows.. Knowledgeborn Allah In all honesty, that'll probably never happen. Jailbreaking iOS opens the doors to a lot of customization on an iPhone, but the security issues are often minimal (with the exception being not having the latest software version). Jailbreaking is pretty much filtered through the Cydia platform. You don't have access to the entire system with a jailbreak. Rooting is completely different, because you can completely reshape the core OS. fbl Note : I don't work for Netflix so I can't comment for them. Possible causes : - the right holders might be pushing for this. I work on roughly the same product area and we don't implement DRM because we like them, we implement them because we contractually have to. -Netflix is tired of getting low notes because of crashes coming by shitty hacks in custom roms. Zach Mauch Anyone know how chromebooks will be affected by this? Will dev mode being enabled cause you to fail SafetyNet Checks? That is currently the only way to install apks on Chromebooks. Branko But Android AOSP!11 -Google 2011 How the times how changed. Wayne Randall ALT arguement, because I don't have time to read every comment... This doesn't limit me and my rooted N6P at all, this move limits how much money they (the devs and Google) are going to make. I can't buy it (the app or coins, or special characters, or bonus content, w/e) if I can't see it. Plain and simple. The important apps will still be there. No app is worth unroot. Block Project Fi from root though... weeeellll. I guess I'd unroot for that. mxwp yeah, only Netflix, banks, and big names will use these blocks. i am guessing most devs want as much exposure as possible. PVL_93_RU Google is actively trying to kill the modding community. Not the Custom ROM makers, but people who root and install Xposed. All because they compromise the security for Android Pay I fear the day root and Xposed apps start disappearing from the Play Store trparky If it comes to security vs being open, security will always win (or at least should always win). Eric Koop I had my Shaw Gateway app update yesterday and they changed it so it doesn't work if rooted. So I had to uninstall and find an APK online of an older version. Now it's just a matter of time before I forget and re-install the update. What a pain... disqus_em5YfkbWdk Well this would certainly get me to cancel Netflix. My personal Plex server is far better than Netflix could ever be anyway. Vivek Rameses Becoming apple more and more every day. Disgusting. Knowledgeborn Allah Android is starting to look more and more like iOS with each update... ¯_(ツ)_/¯ trparky Open platforms rarely stay open once the Benjamins start rolling in. hp-fourtwenty Go ahead and block me...I'll just pirate your app. Play nice and so will I. Start poking me and I'll poke back by never giving you another penny. App devs can't beat XDA devs. It's not going to happen. My unlocked, rooted, rommed and modded device still passes safety net. The day that stops, so does the flow of money leaving my hands on the play store. Luxferro Lay off the sodas.... UniBroW Question, can those of you without access to Netflix on Google play, can it be installed from the Amazon App Store? Stanley C. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/dd381b7e8a39df74c4725712a0db906098c965e9ee4194b6e01e020fd69ee566.png Thats how magisk is made... Magic! Marti Abernathey Yawn. I've got a rooted device and just installed Netflix... because? Magisk. As soon as they made this choice I cancelled. Not because I can't get around it, but because they make me do that. mrjayviper even on a non-rooted LOS mis 5s+, I cannot install Netflix. unlocking the bootloader already tripped safety. And I don't want to root. The features available in non-rooted LOS is enough for me. Teh BuG No. Bueno. TedPhillips Sigh. What's the over-under on this becoming pervasive in the play store... MicroG / Fdroid I'm coming soon. World needs a solid single alternative gcm replacement to catch on. TedPhillips As far as the potential for support overhead, being rooted is generally less than the pain coming from the Xposed/magisk crowd. You need to be actively interfering with an app via root vs code being injected into low levels of the framework that everything uses. TedPhillips I think the best outcome could be that Google opens up their process for little guys to certify there own rom builds, ala let's encrypt lowering friction on getting ssl setup. AOSP should not be a functionally useless base implementation for I'm roms, but something you can use in​ practice. TedPhillips Hey guys, don't worry. Google says Android is for everyone. https://www.android.com/everyone/ That includes AOSP developers too, right? That website seems to tread the line pretty carefully, ala 'no one is forcing you use Google play' but Hiroshi's quote seems like it comes with a grain of salt since he owns Play. I'd love to see AP interview him about this. qkjDlav As an app developer for a large app used globally, the two biggest time wasters in a developer's life are a) debugging device specific issues (HTC, Samsung, etc) and b) crash logs with Xposed in the stack trace. Developers are tired of having to sit around with device farms at their desks just to make sure new features and changes work with each quirky variant of Android that manufacturers want to deploy, and custom roms do make it worse. Enthusiasts are welcome to customize their own versions of Android and sideload apps, but we don't want to see crashlogs in the Developer Console from rooted/custom ROM users. And companies probably don't want to keep paying us to debug issues that only a small minority of users will see. Lê Nguyên Chương Most stupid thing I've ever heard in my life.

For months, American spy hunters had scrambled to uncover details of Russia's influence operation against the 2016 presidential election. In offices in both D.C. and suburban Virginia, they had created massive wall charts to track the different players in Russia's multipronged scheme. But the report in early March was something new. It described how Russia had already moved on from the rudimentary email hacks against politicians it had used in 2016. Now the Russians were running a more sophisticated hack on Twitter. The report said the Russians had sent expertly tailored messages carrying malware to more than 10,000 Twitter users in the Defense Department. Depending on the interests of the targets, the messages offered links to stories on recent sporting events or the Oscars, which had taken place the previous weekend. When clicked, the links took users to a Russian-controlled server that downloaded a program allowing Moscow's hackers to take control of the victim's phone or computer--and Twitter account. As they scrambled to contain the damage from the hack and regain control of any compromised devices, the spy hunters realized they faced a new kind of threat. In 2016, Russia had used thousands of covert human agents and robot computer programs to spread disinformation referencing the stolen campaign emails of Hillary Clinton, amplifying their effect. Now counterintelligence officials wondered: What chaos could Moscow unleash with thousands of Twitter handles that spoke in real time with the authority of the armed forces of the United States? At any given moment, perhaps during a natural disaster or a terrorist attack, Pentagon Twitter accounts might send out false information. As each tweet corroborated another, and covert Russian agents amplified the messages even further afield, the result could be panic and confusion. Illustration by Brobel Design for TIME  For many Americans, Russian hacking remains a story about the 2016 election. But there is another story taking shape. Marrying a hundred years of expertise in influence operations to the new world of social media, Russia may finally have gained the ability it long sought but never fully achieved in the Cold War: to alter the course of events in the U.S. by manipulating public opinion. The vast openness and anonymity of social media has cleared a dangerous new route for antidemocratic forces. "Using these technologies, it is possible to undermine democratic government, and it's becoming easier every day," says Rand Waltzman of the Rand Corp., who ran a major Pentagon research program to understand the propaganda threats posed by social media technology. Current and former officials at the FBI, at the CIA and in Congress now believe the 2016 Russian operation was just the most visible battle in an ongoing information war against global democracy. And they've become more vocal about their concern. "If there has ever been a clarion call for vigilance and action against a threat to the very foundation of our democratic political system, this episode is it," former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper testified before Congress on May 8. If that sounds alarming, it helps to understand the battlescape of this new information war. As they tweet and like and upvote their way through social media, Americans generate a vast trove of data on what they think and how they respond to ideas and arguments--literally thousands of expressions of belief every second on Twitter, Facebook, Reddit and Google. All of those digitized convictions are collected and stored, and much of that data is available commercially to anyone with sufficient computing power to take advantage of it. That's where the algorithms come in. American researchers have found they can use mathematical formulas to segment huge populations into thousands of subgroups according to defining characteristics like religion and political beliefs or taste in TV shows and music. Other algorithms can determine those groups' hot-button issues and identify "followers" among them, pinpointing those most susceptible to suggestion. Propagandists can then manually craft messages to influence them, deploying covert provocateurs, either humans or automated computer programs known as bots, in hopes of altering their behavior. That is what Moscow is doing, more than a dozen senior intelligence officials and others investigating Russia's influence operations tell TIME. The Russians "target you and see what you like, what you click on, and see if you're sympathetic or not sympathetic," says a senior intelligence official. Whether and how much they have actually been able to change Americans' behavior is hard to say. But as they have investigated the Russian 2016 operation, intelligence and other officials have found that Moscow has developed sophisticated tactics. In one case last year, senior intelligence officials tell TIME, a Russian soldier based in Ukraine successfully infiltrated a U.S. social media group by pretending to be a 42-year-old American housewife and weighing in on political debates with specially tailored messages. In another case, officials say, Russia created a fake Facebook account to spread stories on political issues like refugee resettlement to targeted reporters they believed were susceptible to influence. As Russia expands its cyberpropaganda efforts, the U.S. and its allies are only just beginning to figure out how to fight back. One problem: the fear of Russian influence operations can be more damaging than the operations themselves. Eager to appear more powerful than they are, the Russians would consider it a success if you questioned the truth of your news sources, knowing that Moscow might be lurking in your Facebook or Twitter feed. But figuring out if they are is hard. Uncovering "signals that indicate a particular handle is a state-sponsored account is really, really difficult," says Jared Cohen, CEO of Jigsaw, a subsidiary of Google's parent company, Alphabet, which tackles global security challenges. Like many a good spy tale, the story of how the U.S. learned its democracy could be hacked started with loose lips. In May 2016, a Russian military intelligence officer bragged to a colleague that his organization, known as the GRU, was getting ready to pay Clinton back for what President Vladimir Putin believed was an influence operation she had run against him five years earlier as Secretary of State. The GRU, he said, was going to cause chaos in the upcoming U.S. election. What the officer didn't know, senior intelligence officials tell TIME, was that U.S. spies were listening. They wrote up the conversation and sent it back to analysts at headquarters, who turned it from raw intelligence into an official report and circulated it. But if the officer's boast seems like a red flag now, at the time U.S. officials didn't know what to make of it. "We didn't really understand the context of it until much later," says the senior intelligence official. Investigators now realize that the officer's boast was the first indication U.S. spies had from their sources that Russia wasn't just hacking email accounts to collect intelligence but was also considering interfering in the vote. Like much of America, many in the U.S. government hadn't imagined the kind of influence operation that Russia was preparing to unleash on the 2016 election. Fewer still realized it had been five years in the making. In 2011, protests in more than 70 cities across Russia had threatened Putin's control of the Kremlin. The uprising was organized on social media by a popular blogger named Alexei Navalny, who used his blog as well as Twitter and Facebook to get crowds in the streets. Putin's forces broke out their own social media technique to strike back. When bloggers tried to organize nationwide protests on Twitter using #Triumfalnaya, pro-Kremlin botnets bombarded the hashtag with anti-protester messages and nonsense tweets, making it impossible for Putin's opponents to coalesce. Putin publicly accused then Secretary of State Clinton of running a massive influence operation against his country, saying she had sent "a signal" to protesters and that the State Department had actively worked to fuel the protests. The State Department said it had just funded pro-democracy organizations. Former officials say any such operations--in Russia or elsewhere--would require a special intelligence finding by the President and that Barack Obama was not likely to have issued one. After his re-election the following year, Putin dispatched his newly installed head of military intelligence, Igor Sergun, to begin repurposing cyberweapons previously used for psychological operations in war zones for use in electioneering. Russian intelligence agencies funded "troll farms," botnet spamming operations and fake news outlets as part of an expanding focus on psychological operations in cyberspace. Related cyber crimeWhy a Global Cyber Crisis Stalled-This Time cyber crime Why a Global Cyber Crisis Stalled-This Time It turns out Putin had outside help. One particularly talented Russian programmer who had worked with social media researchers in the U.S. for 10 years had returned to Moscow and brought with him a trove of algorithms that could be used in influence operations. He was promptly hired by those working for Russian intelligence services, senior intelligence officials tell TIME. "The engineer who built them the algorithms is U.S.-trained," says the senior intelligence official. Soon, Putin was aiming his new weapons at the U.S. Following Moscow's April 2014 invasion of Ukraine, the U.S. considered sanctions that would block the export of drilling and fracking technologies to Russia, putting out of reach some $8.2 trillion in oil reserves that could not be tapped without U.S. technology. As they watched Moscow's intelligence operations in the U.S., American spy hunters saw Russian agents applying their new social media tactics on key aides to members of Congress. Moscow's agents broadcast material on social media and watched how targets responded in an attempt to find those who might support their cause, the senior intelligence official tells TIME. "The Russians started using it on the Hill with staffers," the official says, "to see who is more susceptible to continue this program [and] to see who would be more favorable to what they want to do." On Aug. 7, 2016, the infamous pharmaceutical executive Martin Shkreli declared that Hillary Clinton had Parkinson's. That story went viral in late August, then took on a life of its own after Clinton fainted from pneumonia and dehydration at a Sept. 11 event in New York City. Elsewhere people invented stories saying Pope Francis had endorsed Trump and Clinton had murdered a DNC staffer. Just before Election Day, a story took off alleging that Clinton and her aides ran a pedophile ring in the basement of a D.C. pizza parlor. Congressional investigators are looking at how Russia helped stories like these spread to specific audiences. Counterintelligence officials, meanwhile, have picked up evidence that Russia tried to target particular influencers during the election season who they reasoned would help spread the damaging stories. These officials have seen evidence of Russia using its algorithmic techniques to target the social media accounts of particular reporters, senior intelligence officials tell TIME. "It's not necessarily the journal or the newspaper or the TV show," says the senior intelligence official. "It's the specific reporter that they find who might be a little bit slanted toward believing things, and they'll hit him" with a flood of fake news stories. Russia plays in every social media space. The intelligence officials have found that Moscow's agents bought ads on Facebook to target specific populations with propaganda. "They buy the ads, where it says sponsored by--they do that just as much as anybody else does," says the senior intelligence official. (A Facebook official says the company has no evidence of that occurring.) The ranking Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, Mark Warner of Virginia, has said he is looking into why, for example, four of the top five Google search results the day the U.S. released a report on the 2016 operation were links to Russia's TV propaganda arm, RT. (Google says it saw no meddling in this case.) Researchers at the University of Southern California, meanwhile, found that nearly 20% of political tweets in 2016 between Sept. 16 and Oct. 21 were generated by bots of unknown origin; investigators are trying to figure out how many were Russian. As they dig into the viralizing of such stories, congressional investigations are probing not just Russia's role but whether Moscow had help from the Trump campaign. Sources familiar with the investigations say they are probing two Trump-linked organizations: Cambridge Analytica, a data-analytics company hired by the campaign that is partly owned by deep-pocketed Trump backer Robert Mercer; and Breitbart News, the right-wing website formerly run by Trump's top political adviser Stephen Bannon. The congressional investigators are looking at ties between those companies and right-wing web personalities based in Eastern Europe who the U.S. believes are Russian fronts, a source familiar with the investigations tells TIME. "Nobody can prove it yet," the source says. In March, McClatchy newspapers reported that FBI counterintelligence investigators were probing whether far-right sites like Breitbart News and Infowars had coordinated with Russian botnets to blitz social media with anti-Clinton stories, mixing fact and fiction when Trump was doing poorly in the campaign. There are plenty of people who are skeptical of such a conspiracy, if one existed. Cambridge Analytica touts its ability to use algorithms to microtarget voters, but veteran political operatives have found them ineffective political influencers. Ted Cruz first used their methods during the primary, and his staff ended up concluding they had wasted their money. Mercer, Bannon, Breitbart News and the White House did not answer questions about the congressional probes. A spokesperson for Cambridge Analytica says the company has no ties to Russia or individuals acting as fronts for Moscow and that it is unaware of the probe. Democratic operatives searching for explanations for Clinton's loss after the election investigated social media trends in the three states that tipped the vote for Trump: Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. In each they found what they believe is evidence that key swing voters were being drawn to fake news stories and anti-Clinton stories online. Google searches for the fake pedophilia story circulating under the hashtag #pizzagate, for example, were disproportionately higher in swing districts and not in districts likely to vote for Trump. The Democratic operatives created a package of background materials on what they had found, suggesting the search behavior might indicate that someone had successfully altered the behavior in key voting districts in key states. They circulated it to fellow party members who are up for a vote in 2018. Former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper calls Russian cyber­ influence operations a threat to democracy Brendan Smialowski—AFP/Getty Images  Even as investigators try to piece together what happened in 2016, they are worrying about what comes next. Russia claims to be able to alter events using cyberpropaganda and is doing what it can to tout its power. In February 2016, a Putin adviser named Andrey Krutskikh compared Russia's information-warfare strategies to the Soviet Union's obtaining a nuclear weapon in the 1940s, David Ignatius of the Washington Post reported. "We are at the verge of having something in the information arena which will allow us to talk to the Americans as equals," Krutskikh said. Related technologyTeenagers Already Know the Key to Protecting Your Privacy technology Teenagers Already Know the Key to Protecting Your Privacy But if Russia is clearly moving forward, it's less clear how active the U.S. has been. Documents released by former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden and published by the Intercept suggested that the British were pursuing social media propaganda and had shared their tactics with the U.S. Chris Inglis, the former No. 2 at the National Security Agency, says the U.S. has not pursued this capability. "The Russians are 10 years ahead of us in being willing to make use of" social media to influence public opinion, he says. There are signs that the U.S. may be playing in this field, however. From 2010 to 2012, the U.S. Agency for International Development established and ran a "Cuban Twitter" network designed to undermine communist control on the island. At the same time, according to the Associated Press, which discovered the program, the U.S. government hired a contractor to profile Cuban cell phone users, categorizing them as "pro-revolution," "apolitical" or "antirevolutionary." Much of what is publicly known about the mechanics and techniques of social media propaganda comes from a program at the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) that the Rand researcher, Waltzman, ran to study how propagandists might manipulate social media in the future. In the Cold War, operatives might distribute disinformation-laden newspapers to targeted political groups or insinuate an agent provocateur into a group of influential intellectuals. By harnessing computing power to segment and target literally millions of people in real time online, Waltzman concluded, you could potentially change behavior "on the scale of democratic governments." In the U.S., public scrutiny of such programs is usually enough to shut them down. In 2014, news articles appeared about the DARPA program and the "Cuban Twitter" project. It was only a year after Snowden had revealed widespread monitoring programs by the government. The DARPA program, already under a cloud, was allowed to expire quietly when its funding ran out in 2015. In the wake of Russia's 2016 election hack, the question is how to research social media propaganda without violating civil liberties. The need is all the more urgent because the technology continues to advance. While today humans are still required to tailor and distribute messages to specially targeted "susceptibles," in the future crafting and transmitting emotionally powerful messages will be automated. The U.S. government is constrained in what kind of research it can fund by various laws protecting citizens from domestic propaganda, government electioneering and intrusions on their privacy. Waltzman has started a group called Information Professionals Association with several former information operations officers from the U.S. military to develop defenses against social media influence operations. Social media companies are beginning to realize that they need to take action. Facebook issued a report in April 2017 acknowledging that much disinformation had been spread on its pages and saying it had expanded its security. Google says it has seen no evidence of Russian manipulation of its search results but has updated its algorithms just in case. Twitter claims it has diminished cyberpropaganda by tweaking its algorithms to block cleverly designed bots. "Our algorithms currently work to detect when Twitter accounts are attempting to manipulate Twitter's Trends through inorganic activity, and then automatically adjust," the company said in a statement. In the meantime, America's best option to protect upcoming votes may be to make it harder for Russia and other bad actors to hide their election-related information operations. When it comes to defeating Russian influence operations, the answer is "transparency, transparency, transparency," says Rhode Island Democratic Senator Sheldon Whitehouse. He has written legislation that would curb the massive, anonymous campaign contributions known as dark money and the widespread use of shell corporations that he says make Russian cyberpropaganda harder to trace and expose. But much damage has already been done. "The ultimate impact of [the 2016 Russian operation] is we're never going to look at another election without wondering, you know, Is this happening, can we see it happening?" says Jigsaw's Jared Cohen. By raising doubts about the validity of the 2016 vote and the vulnerability of future elections, Russia has achieved its most important objective: undermining the credibility of American democracy. For now, investigators have added the names of specific trolls and botnets to their wall charts in the offices of intelligence and law-enforcement agencies. They say the best way to compete with the Russian model is by having a better message. "It requires critical thinkers and people who have a more powerful vision" than the cynical Russian view, says former NSA deputy Inglis. And what message is powerful enough to take on the firehose of falsehoods that Russia is deploying in targeted, effective ways across a range of new media? One good place to start: telling the truth. --With reporting by PRATHEEK REBALA/WASHINGTON Correction: The original version of this story misstated Jared Cohen’s title. He is CEO, not president.

Netflix was just the start: Google Play Console lets developers exclude app availability for devices that don't pass SafetyNet Rita El Khoury Follow View All Posts 2017/05/18 3:57am PDTMay 18, 2017 93 Plus 1 on G+ 108 Share on Facebook 82 Share on Twitter Total Shares283 Google News Last weekend, a huge turmoil swept the root-enthusiast Android community as it was discovered then confirmed that the Netflix app was being blocked from showing up in search results on the Play Store for rooted devices. At the time, Netflix said it was using Widevine to block unsupported devices, but that made no sense to us: the app was still functional if it was sideloaded, it was only not showing up as compatible in the Play Store. So what sorcery was Netflix really using?! Turns out it's a new function of the Google Play Console. As part of the updates announced for the Play Console at I/O 2017, Google mentions a new Device Catalog section under Release management that lets developers choose with intricate granularity which devices their app supports on the Play Store. Devices can be viewed and excluded by many attributes including RAM and SoC, but the important factor we're interested in is SafetyNet Attestation. New "Device catalog" lets devs manage the exclusions. Developers will be able to choose from 3 states shown in the top image: not excluding devices based on SafetyNet, excluding those that don't pass integrity, or excluding the latter plus those that aren't certified by Google. That means any dev could potentially block their apps from showing and being directly installable in the Play Store on devices that are rooted and/or running a custom ROM, as well as on emulators and uncertified devices (think Meizu and its not-so-legal way of getting Play Services and the Play Store on its phones). This is exactly what many of you were afraid would happen after the Play Store app started surfacing a Device certification status. This is different from the full SafetyNet API implementation that apps like Android Pay and Pokémon Go use. In the case of Pay/Go, the attestation check happens when the app is installed on your phone and doesn't allow it to run unless it passes the integrity test. But in the case of the Play Console, the attestation check happens when you're browsing the Play Store and only affects the availability of the app for your device. If the full SafetyNet API isn't included in the app itself, you will still be able to grab the APK from other sources, install it, and the app will work just fine. Still, this spells trouble for rooted users and the Android enthusiast community as a whole. Google keeps erecting more and more obstacles each day in the face of root and custom ROMs and even if this won't stop root users who should be knowledgable enough to know how/where to grab an APK and install it, it will make things more and more difficult and maybe less and less worth the trouble. But y'all are rebels and you'll keep on finding a way around it, won't you?

Nice move Google. Suicide_Note Not sure if serious, but either way, this was just a matter of time. YouNex Obviously not serious EowynCarter So, question : Is there anyway to get android O in the future on my nexus 6 and not having problems with this ? IF manufacturer where taking care of updating their devices, wouldn't be an issue... saf1927 If Magisk keeps working, yep. You can. Even my old Nexus 5 is on 7.1.2 and it passes SafetyNet. EowynCarter I want "just work" stuff. Not workaround. Maybe Magisk does the job for some, but not an acceptable solution from my point of view. Mainly the "we don't know if it will keep on working" part. saf1927 Well, it's the best solution so far and it has improved a lot since its inception. I never bothered since the Nexus 5 was a secondary device for me, but now that some apps won't show up anymore on the Play Store, I simply flashed Magisk and that's about it. I haven't tweaked anything. Plus, if you are already flashing a custom ROM, flashing an extra zip file isn't that much work anyway. EowynCarter True, but it's the phone I use dailly. I don't want apps sudendly not working, becasue google decided to push an update that broke magisk. mxwp well if you want things to "just work" then i guess get an iPhone EowynCarter Sadly, I'm beginning to think about that. But that would cause others frustrations. ED-Zが現れた! Well, people will just flock to root-supported apps... Milton P. I actually forgot when was the last time I Rooted a device. No biggie. Suicide_Note The bad thing is it isn't just root that causes problems. Simply unlocking the bootloader will produce the same result. Maxr1998 Just because it's no biggie for you, it doesn't mean everyone approves this. I am actually pretty concerned, because this limits the freedom over our devices even more.. Milton P. Define freedom, please. Maxr1998 Software freedom, to be more specific. You should have the freedom to use and modify your device and it's software however you'd like, and have fill control over it. That means, root access. And since the AOSP core IS free software, the 4 freedoms defined by Richard Stallman apply to it. What this change now introduces is that you're forced to decide between either giving up the freedom over your device or not using the app you wanted to download (which will probably have to be my choice, and that sucks). Milton P. But you're not giving up anything, you just have to make a choice. If you put that way, Google has the freedom of doing with the AOSP core whatever they want, the same way you can modify said core and do as you please, the difference is Google has more money and more responsibilities when it comes to their user base. XDA and other sites will still have a bunch of developers making whatever they please (within the AOSP terms) with the AOSP core. This will just change thinks for the people that use those ROMs bit realistically the vast majority of users won't feel the changes. Sad but true. h4rr4r That choice is giving up freedom you had before. The vast majority will see the rate of Android improvements slow as the Devs on XDA and the like lose interest. Android only exists because of Linux, now it is turning its back on that whole culture. Milton P. Well, I don't see your freedom compromised to be honest with you, but we're seeing things from different angles so that's that. Sorry for your loss in that case. h4rr4r You do not think losing control of your device is a loss of freedom? Milton P. Nope, is just a device, I have more important stuff going on, m device is a tool the same way a hammer is a tool, you can buy a hammer and use it as it is. Sometimes my device is a toy, if I buy a remote control car I'll modify it as long as it is possible, the same way I modify my phone. I have control over my phone. I can install whatever I want at my own risk. If I decide to root my phone I expect things to be broken. I remember when I had an HTC and I hated sense so I decided to install a custom ROM, I gave up the camera and I was aware of it. There was always some compromises with custom ROMs, nothing is changing. I rather have a safe device then a compromised one today, still my choice thou. h4rr4r So you want IOS. Got it. Over here I want freedom. I don't think homedepot should be allowed to tell me what I can hit with the hammer I bought. trparky Open platforms rarely stay open once they become popular. Once the Benjamins come rolling in it tends to override open. h4rr4r Tell that to Linus Torvalds. I am sure he will have many many fuck yous for you. trparky Linux is the rare situation. h4rr4r The rare situation like many others that created android and even google. trparky Yeah but look at Android, the walls are closing around it and there's nothing you can do about it. Face it man, the geeks may have built the system but the common man now rules it. Geeks love choice, yes, they do love their choice but your average person doesn't give a rat's ass about choice. All they want is a device that does what they need it to do when they want to do it. They have no inclination to learn how it works or why it works just as long as it does. This is what geeks do not and refuse to understand. h4rr4r Sure there is, stop using it. Then the common folks will have to follow us to the next platform. trparky As long as their is money involved in maintaining Android it doesn't matter if something better comes along, people will continue supporting Android because it makes them money. Money makes the world go round, get used to it. Maxr1998 ^ What @h4rr4r:disqus says. trparky Yep. The root and ROM community is such a small portion of the Android ecosystem that they really don't matter to them. People have been screaming at Google for years to get the Android house fixed up, this is them doing just that. You can't blame them for doing what the people have asked for. mxwp I agree with you, but sadly you only have freedom over hardware. You can do what you want with the device you buy. But with software you never actually buy it... you only buy a license to use it. Thus you have no real freedom with software. Maxr1998 Android is free software, Apache 2.0 license. At least the AOSP part of it. trparky But the Google parts of it are not covered under the Apache 2.0 license. That's essentially why ROM developers can't package the Google Play Services pack with the ROM itself and instead requires you to download a separate ZIP package from Google to install it separate from the ROM package. Android itself may be free and open but the Google Play Services part is not. Sudev There are far more than few arguments against root access but here are some: Root access is meant for experimental & development purpose and not for Daily Driver for any average user of the platform. Google Play Services & Apps available on Play Store are not "Free Software". Google as provider of Play Services infrastructure has much more liabilities then one can simply assume. And also the app developers have responsibility to protect end users' data. If device has root access available and any rouge app / maleware steals other apps data which is possible, who will be at stack? h4rr4r The ability to do anything I want with my things that I own. Milton P. You​ can do whatever you want with your device, nobody is stopping you. You might see that some apps are not showing up in the play store but you can still side load them, I still see freedom in your future. h4rr4r For how much longer? Soon these apps will ask play services if they are supposed to be installed on that device, at that point you can say goodbye to sideloading. If this is what people want then IOS was the platform for them. thecoolkid Ok Google, define freedom... 😁 Nick I would imagine a great deal of people on this site will be upset, but in actuality I don't think this will affect the user base of many apps that badly h4rr4r Not in the short term. However in the long term it will. Android only exists because of the FREE software movement. Nick Yes, but that doesn't apply to applications, which this is about. h4rr4r Think long term. Same thing applies. trparky No it won't because the root and ROM community is so small it doesn't matter to Google anymore. The 95% of people who simply want a device that works don't care and likely won't ever care. As long as they can play NetFlix, Pokemon Go, or whatever is the next craze they don't care. h4rr4r Again, that is short term thinking. Think past the end of your nose. Android exists because of linux. Google needs this small group to create the very stuff they rely on. trparky You overestimate the value that the community has now. Android may have needed the community back in the beginning to gain the foothold that it has in the market but not so anymore. Android has near 100% market penetration, they have achieved world domination. They don't need the community anymore, they have achieved their goals. h4rr4r Until they are unseated. IBM once had a monopoly on computing devices. They did not need the community to gain a foothold, they would not have a product to gain a foothold without the community. Android only exists because of a collection of those projects. trparky No, Android exists because Samsung, HTC, and LG make devices people want and it makes them money by the semi-truck full. The community doesn't mean shit now, all that matters to these companies is one thing... money, money, and more money. Oh, and did I mention money? This is capitalism man, money rules the world. If you don't make money you are dead. h4rr4r Please tell me how that would have happened without linux. Money loses to good engineering every day. Look at how linux killed solaris. trparky Tell me why Windows is the defacto monopoly on the desktop despite the fact that Linux is better in every damn way possible under the hood? That's right... money. h4rr4r Because the desktop is dead. The fight is over. They lost. Even money can't keep them relevant. trparky Oh, you're funny. The desktop is not dead, it will never be dead. When people need to do real work, they sit down at a desktop. When people want to play real games, they sit down at a desktop. When people need to type out anything longer than a page like a college term paper, they sit down at a desktop. The desktop is king and will always be king. Long live the desktop! h4rr4r The Desktop is a dead man walking. When they do real work, they use a Citrix session. When they game they use a console, or they are already nerds. When people type they can use a fucking chromebook. The desktop as you think of it died already. trparky Try and say that shit over at TechPowerUp, HardOCP, Overclock.net, TomsHardware, etc. and trust me when I say this... you'll be run out of town by people with pitchforks and torches. h4rr4r Those are all nerds. Those are the folks who have desktops running 3 different OSes. They are the folks who are pissed about android being locked down. trparky And your point being? You just admitted that only the "nerds" care about Android being open. Sure, those same "nerds" will go off and create a new platform but the rest of the people who are living in the real world and who don't care one damn bit about how it works will continue to use Android. h4rr4r Those people will eventually move to the new platform. Just like they did with Android. trparky And the same thing will happen to that platform in the future that's happening to Android now. Open platforms are nice and all, I'll admit that, but your average person doesn't care one bit. I dare you to go up to any person on the street and ask them anything about Android. What phone do they have? What model? Most will say "I don't know, something that my carrier gave me for cheap." h4rr4r The wheel of computing we call it. It has happened and will happen again. So what? trparky Which reinforces the idea that I said before, eventually all open systems will become closed (or less open) at some point in their life cycle. It usually happens when it becomes popular with the common man. Why? Because like I've been trying to get through your thick skull, the average person doesn't care how any of this stuff works so long as it works. h4rr4r The average person does not matter. Few open systems become closed. AOSP is still fine. trparky What the hell do you mean by "they don't matter"? They're the ones buying the devices, buying the apps, looking at the ads, etc. Just how the fuck does that translate to "they don't matter"? h4rr4r Because they don't. They don't create, they don't cause new things to be created. They are just users, just like I don't matter to how movies are created. trparky But without money from the people who are consuming said things developers won't make new stuff. Developers do have to eat you know and put a roof over their heads. h4rr4r The giant world of FOSS pretty much proves you wrong. Demand cannot create supply. I don't pirate anything kiddo. I have way too much to lose for that. One of those lawsuits I would actually have to pay, since I could. trparky I'll give a hint on how FOSS works a lot of the time. Some of the top tier Linux kernel developers actually work for companies and they just contribute code in their free time. They may work for Intel, AMD, nVidia, or God knows what but only after their day job is done. Why? Because they need money and they need to eat. This is a basic requirement for people in this world. They need money!!! People don't just write code for the love of it, even Linus Torvalds who's in charge of the Linux kernel itself works for the Linux Foundation and yes, he gets paid for his work to the tune of $10 Million a year. Sorry to burst your bubble man but FOSS projects aren't all happy, happy, joy, joy here... people need to be paid real money to be able to eat, drive a car, put a roof over their heads, etc. On second thought, I'm not sorry I burst your bubble! You need it burst! PEOPLE NEED TO BE PAID REAL FUCKING MONEY!!!! h4rr4r No, they get paid to contribute. During the work day. Not as a hobby. Lots of projects are like that. I won't say exactly how I know about that ;) Their employers just aren't as short sighted as you. Linus did not however create linux to get rich. Great code like great art gets created because it must be. People do what they love. Kid, you will get it one day. When you have enough that you aren't worried about it each day, money stops being that big of a deal. Don't worry everybody goes through a phase like you are now. trparky Dude, we are not the Federation of Planets here living in a happy, happy, joy, joy world in which people can just do whatever they want to do without a care in the world. As long as human greed exists there will always be a need for money. And believe you me, greed will never go away unless we breed a new kind of human and I don't see that happening any time soon. Gene Roddenberry's future will never happen, it just won't. Contrary to a lot of geek dreams it just won't. h4rr4r No idea where you got that idea. Never suggested it. My point was the personal relative value of increasing income drops as income goes up. If you make minimum wage doubling your income is a huge deal. Adding the same amount to my income would not get me to take a job I like less. Offering it to Linus would be a waste of time. Yes, some people will keep chasing dollars, they are the exception not the rule. The employers are working on enlightened self interest. Either they use the FOSS product, gain market advantage with direct knowledge, use it for marketing or believe they are getting something else. PostgreSQL for example has a lot of paid contributors who work for companies that either provide customization, consulting or depend on the project. Others just because it increases quality. Commercial software by and large is not high quality. I have seen a lot of it and 90% if you tried to submit it to a FOSS project of any size would get you denied and possibly mocked. This system continues to be more innovative because it is easy to continue to expand. Anyone with a good idea can fork if their idea is not accepted. trparky > My point was the personal relative value of increasing income drops as income goes up. Tell that to the people in Washington or any CEO that demands ever increasing yearly salaries and end of year bonuses all while raping the companies that they work for. Tell that to the psychopaths on Wall Street. For as long as their is money, people will want more of it. Anyone who says that they don't is flat out lying. h4rr4r Those are the exception not the rule. That is why you call them psychopaths. Honestly, correcting for inflation I really don't care that much if I ever make more. Would it be nice sure, would I give up anything I like about my job? No. If you could double my income but it prevented me from contributing to FOSS projects or owning code I generate off the clock, I would not take that deal. If money was enough to make people do anything MS would have offered Linus $11 million a year to not write it. Heck, Sun would have done it while they were still around. trparky Either you're a child that doesn't know how the adult world works or you're a fucking troll. h4rr4r So you have no idea who makes stuff, neat. I guess you think Henry Ford should have made a faster horse. trparky Oh, I know who makes the stuff I use but I also make sure that they are paid! I give money to those developers who write the programs that I enjoy and if I can't pay them I won't use their programs. I only use a program if I can pay for it. I have put money into their tip jars on their web site, I look for PayPal links and I donate even if it's something small like $5. They deserve it! h4rr4r Good for you! There is a lot of great software that does not make money that way. Some even just ask is that you follow the license, like linux which mediatek steals by not releasing kernel source. So I hope you avoid buying that kind of thing. trparky MediaTek controller chips are known to suck so I don't buy them out of that reason alone. h4rr4r Now I have given you another good reason to avoid them. Bunch of thieves. Rita El Khoury I don't even remember when I last bootloader unlocked. But I know this move toward closing the ecosystem further and further will have ripples in the future. The enthusiast community flocked toward Android for its openness and we have custom ROMs and their enterprising devs to thank for HUNDREDS of new features that they implemented first and everyone clamored for and applauded until they became features in AOSP. If Google thinks it can steer this ship alone and it knows best what to do next, we may have less and less interesting features in the future and more and more of what only one entity thinks is best, not a diverse set of opinions. Nick Given that this only gives the developer the option of requiring these checks, it makes me believe that Google had to do this for some companies that have regulatory or other kinds of requirements. Which is a shame for the rooted (and unlocked?) community, but understandable. Shame Google is most likely going to take the blame here in this comment section though. Rita El Khoury Well, maybe they had to, but that won't stop any developer from implementing it without any regulatory or legal requirement pushing them to do so. Nick Right, which puts this choice on the developer, not Google. Google was stuck behind a rock and hard place, perhaps. EowynCarter Well, google is certainly to blame for not planing to update my nexus 6 to android O. And now I can't even use custom rom as plan B without losing some apps :( Suicide_Note Boo hoo. Buy a new phone and quit crying that Google doesn't support phones forever. EowynCarter Fine can you order a pixel XL and ship it to me in France ? Plus, my nexus 6 still works, I hate having to replace working stuff. Makes no sense, economically and ecologically speaking. Suicide_Note I'll sell you my XL when I'm done with it, but only after i get the Pixel XL 2. :) EowynCarter Well, I do hope Google sells the "pixel 2 "( or whatever its name) here. For now, I'm'just hoping my nexus 6 don't break. Else I might jump on the iOS ship. I'm not convinced the the other android alternatives. Note 8 would be the closest, but touchwiiz, delayed updates.... I'm spoiled after a few years with a nexus. Suicide_Note There always eBay or Swappa if you want to get a first gen Pixel. I was looking at prices over the weekend, and mint condition Pixels are going for about $450. EowynCarter Not so much in France. And eBay for suff that cost more that a few bucks, too risky. Plus, the pixel is getting "old" by now. Wilton Daniel Pinto Troll found trparky Yet Microsoft still supports Windows 7 EIGHT YEARS LATER! How come Microsoft can do that yet Google can't? Alex Louderback Actually, that's Qualcomm EowynCarter Source for this ? trparky And Qualcomm can go fuck themselves. Gee... I wonder why they're being hit with an anti-trust lawsuit. Could this be one of many reasons why? trparky Yes, Google is to blame for that. There's no damn reason why your Nexus 6 can't run Android O other than the fact that they just don't want to. Bojan Bunić My bootloader was unlocked prior to changing the mobo on my 5X, courtesy of Booty Loops. Root, well, probably before I got my Nexus 4. Although I'll see how it'll go on in the future, as we don't have Pixels here, so the only near stock possibility is either OnePlus, or some other device and a custom ROM. Milton P. Agree 100% with you, I mean I remember the old days when I hated HTC's Sense, I literally decided that a phone without a camera was better than whatever HTC did back then, but Android has evolved quite a lot nowadays, don't get me wrong, I do believe that custom ROMs did a great job showing Google what the users want but that won't change, as long as someone shows Google what people want Google will keep improving Android, because there's no limits. Now if they go the Apple way and lock EVERYTHING then we'll be fucked, I'm the meantime developers will find a way around the system pushing Google along. Premsuraj An open bootloader and root actually solves a lot of problems still existing in AOSP. The Nougat update absolutely destoryed the battery life of many Nexus 6P devices, with Google only focussing on the Pixels, there was no fix in it. I unlocked, used Franco Kernel + naptime + Greenify and I now I get adequate battery life. Another feature I can think of is theming. Material design is good, but the whiteness is rage inducing Maxr1998 Well, fuck them. Let's just hope not many devs will use this, and Google won't enable this by default anytime soon. Maxr1998 The more I think about this, the more concerned I get. This will reduce the freedom over our devices, and also limit developers in the awesome things they could do before because of Android's openness. I am all in for device security and fighting against malware, trojans and phishing applications, don't understand me wrong, but that doesn't mean that you have to take people away their freedom - just look at how Linux (GNU and Linux) is doing it. Tom Westrick How does this limit developers? If anything it gives them more control. Maxr1998 Fair point, I should have been more specific. With "developers", I meant rom developers and modders, app developers only if they require root access for their apps. "Normal" developers can use this to enforce a "secure" (read: DRM locked-down) environment, but that's not really a good thing in my opinion.. (Refer to my other comments.) trparky You're angry at the wrong people, you should be angry at Hollywood; they're the ones that are demanding this kind of stuff. Their content, their rules; it's how things are in the real world. They have to do what they need to do to protect their investments, plain and simple. We don't necessarily have to like it, hell... we may even hate it, but that's how it is. You want the content? Play by their rules. Colin Richardson If you are an app developer and want your app to run on custom roms..... don't turn on "Requires SafetyNet"... bekifft We are increasingly living in the future Richard Stallman warned us about. With Google taking all these steps, may as well go back to using jailbroken iPhones. Bart Janusz I've already enabled it and I know at least 3 others devs that did it as well. I really don't care about root per se, but custom roms and xposed is source of countless problem as both are buggy as hell. Maxr1998 But in which way does that influence you? Xposed can introduce bugs to the system, sure, but it won't affect the performance of your app unless it itself is modded, so you probably don't have to fear bad reviews for bad performance anyway. And custom roms? LineageOS on my mother's Moto G runs like a champ and much better than the 5.1 stock rom before. And in my experience as a dev, there were much more incompatibilities with Samsung TouchWiz than with AOSP-based custom roms. refthemc I'm sure he's just trying to avoid the headache of emails he gets daily from users who have no idea that it's their fault the app is not working or crashing... Bart Janusz Indeed, not to mention extra crash and ANRs reports which seems to influence app positioning. Maxr1998 But why? The device may behave more buggy at some parts because of Xposed (and mine definitely ran like shit on MM because of some mods, but I NEVER blamed any apps), but the apps itself won't run worse if not modded - normally they should even run better if you only use performance mods like Greenify, NLP Collector wakelock disabler and other light mods. I don't think he gets many reports anyway, considering what @marcusmarcus2:disqus said. Bart Janusz You may not, but many users do, and as I said there are a lot of bogus ANRs and crash reports. Since my app depends heavily on low level OS elements both custom ROMs and xposed are deal breakers (and you really should check source, since I do not update my website as I moved to G+/FB but app has sizable user base given its niche and I'd to deal with ROM/xposed issues fequently). Maxr1998 Well, but the same type of users also give bad reviews etc. without using any mod or root. You generalize modders to only cause problems, and therefore lock out everyone. About your app/website thing: fair point, I didn't look at it yet, and have to apologize for being a little rude. marcusmarcus2 You need to take your own advice, "you really should check source". If you moved to G+/FB, then why does your app on the play store still point to the same website as well. Or at least put a link on the old website that directs to G+/FB. There is nothing that points to your so called G+/FB source. So @Maxr1998:disqus has no other source to check at the moment. Bart Janusz Not that I care but if you try to draw conclusion about app you should probably visit Play Store listing. Anyhow that's really not important I just chimed in to explain why developer will use this. I've choose to do so due to extra burden which in effect hurts majority of my user base, one of my colleagues cited lucky patcher and freedom (which I think is not such a good idea but its his choice). trparky You may not blame the apps because you know better but most people don't understand that, most people see a crashing app and suddenly you see, as the developer, a ton of comments saying that your app sucks. h4rr4r Please do tell us about your apps so we can be sure to avoid them on any devices we have not yet rooted. marcusmarcus2 His disqus profile leads to this website http://artflowstudio.com/ which has a few apps listed. Art oriented apps. There is only 1 update on that website since 2014, so I don't think I would be to concerned about installing one of his apps. Jordan Palmer Nice detective work. Adrian I can see a lot of refund requests coming from people who paid for apps and suddenly are told "Nope. Not for you anymore." A lot of us are rooted and buy apps and you'd better believe noise will be made if an app I use daily, that I paid for, suddenly breaks with an update because it's no longer blessed by the dev to run on my device. It's your app and you can do what you want with it, but there is always another side to the coin. BAlGaInTl That's not the way that Netflix worked it, and I doubt other developers of paid apps would either. I have a OnePlus One, that I run Lineage OS on since the original Cyanogen OS is now defunct and does not receive any updates. Netflix simply doesn't update to v 5+. It still works just fine. I may not get the newest and latest features, but part of that is on me for using a device that is dated. I'm not one of those users who, because I paid for an app once, fells that I should get all of the updates from now until the end of time. That isn't sustainable for developers. It could very well be that Netflix has some new features/offerings in the works in which they are getting pressure from outside sources to push this. A lot of valid reasons for a developer to enable the check exist. As long as they do it in the same manner that Netflix has, I don't see the issue. Adrian And just like Pokemon Go, eventually you'll get a message that you need to upgrade to the latest version or the app won't work, you know, that new version that won't let you actually log into it anymore. We've already seen this happen so let's not pretend that it isn't the next logical step. They aren't going to keep letting people sign in indefinitely with an app that doesn't have the security level they want. It's naive to think that hey I can just stick with the last version that works for root. It takes all of what, the time it takes to create a switch that says minimum version required to log in is "DRM version" BAlGaInTl Good Point. I recognize that. But it seems that the blame (in general) is being directed at Google in many of these posts. If that scenario happens, it isn't Google that blocked you from accessing Netflix. The need for this level of security is on the increase. The same users demanding better security and longer updates are the first ones to cry foul when Google starts laying the groundwork for exactly what they have asked for. Adrian I think there is a way to do both that doesn't piss off a very active community that helped take Android from a very very very ugly, second class OS to what we have now. I know a lot of us remember just how crippled Android was and it was the root/mod community that produced the bulk of what is now standard on Android. There needs to be a way to secure the devices AND not turn their back on the developer community that contributes. The idea, in Netflix's case, that root = pirate is insane. Why in the world would someone prefer to rip content on their phone to say a computer or XBox that is never going to move and can do it while you get on with your life? They're doing something for the sake of saying they're doing something, but if they think it's going to make a dent in piracy they, and the studios are nuts. I watch a lot of Netflix and still prefer to buy discs. People who do things the right way and are perfectly happy paying for content shouldn't have to jump through hoops to watch it. Those of us who root usually have a handful of things that stock Android is not doing for us. It's why we root. If all of these things were available in stock, my reasons for rooting would disappear but I don't see that happening any time soon. I think Android is getting so much better but if they make it exactly like iOS, might as well go to the dark side because Apple's apps tend to be more polished, come out first and OS updates are frequent. Don't bite the hand that feeds you just because you're getting more popular. BAlGaInTl I think that Netflix is a good example. It is HIGHLY likely that the reason for recent unpopular changes (see also VPN blocking) are being driven by other entities. It isn't that Netflix thinks its a problem, but the people that control a large portion of their content do. root pirate but it does introduce a security risk. I don't see how Google is turning their backs on developers. Developers are free to develop as they see fit and choose (at least for the moment) whether or not they will implement the SafetyNet check. The inherent problem is that a circumvented security is still circumvented and can no longer be considered secure. I can clearly see why some apps would and should frown upon that. Maybe not Netflix and Mario (IMHO), but certainly something like bank and payment apps. I don't think the inherent open nature of android will ever reduce to the level of iOS. But some changes have to occur to meet the needs/desire of the majority. Security is inherently difficult. The easier and more flexible you try to make it, the less secure it becomes. Adrian I do think banking apps should run in a secure space. Completely agree with that, but I disagree with root = less secure. My nexus devices stopped getting OS and security updates. Nothing. VERY insecure and dangerous. I rooted them, updated the OS with images from XDA developers and my devices that were once easy targets are more secure. There is always two sides to it. I see that Google is finally trying to take security seriously on Android and doing things in layers that completely cut out the vendor AND the carriers is the right step. Right now, Root is the only way to update a perfectly good device like my Nexus tablet tablet that the vendor said "oh well" to. Until Google has a REAL strategy in place to keep ALL Android devices secure, root will be necessary. Not everyone wants to or can upgrade devices every two years because they get abandoned. My father doesn't need an S8. He does need a device that gets security updates for more than a year after purchasing his phone. BAlGaInTl You are exactly correct, and I'm in the same situation with my OnePlus One. But in working to increase your security level, you leave holes behind. The key words that you used are "more secure." I agree. You are "more secure." But still (probably) less secure than a device that has been thoroughly tested, certified, and passes SafetyNet without hacks. Google has been open that they are working on security updates. They have improved significantly over the last couple years in getting those out. I feel that they are putting in place a real strategy to keep Android devices secure. This is part of that groundwork. I also feel that they are actively looking to replace Android in it's current state, and I can't say I blame them. The only real strategy may be to take lessons learned and start over. Lucky for them, they have the resources to do so. trparky > take lessons learned and start over Pretty much. The worst thing that they did from the very beginning was to allow for the OEMs to do what they wished. Google essentially made a deal with the devil when they released Android to the world. They wrote no requirements into the Android agreements that the OEMs agreed to to require updates to be a necessary thing. Big mistake Google. BAlGaInTl The really needed to in order to get their foot in the door of the market. If it would not have been open source from the beginning, none of the major manufactures would have bought off on it. The fact that they could use it for free (essentially) and still be able to customize on top of it is what sold it. trparky And now look at it, Android is a fucking mess of non-updated insecure devices that are ripe for anyone to be able to take over and turn into a botnet. trparky And you should be raising holy hell with the OEM that made that device! Just because your device is old doesn't mean that it shouldn't still be supported. Windows 7 is nearly eight years old and it still receives Windows Updates. Why can't your device? BAlGaInTl Normally, I would agree, but the OnePlus One is a special case. The OEM operating system is the now defunct Cyanogen OS. I had to balance having the original OS without updates, or running another with updates. The phone is now almost three years old. If I bought a PC with Windows on it three years ago, and Microsoft had since gone out of business, should the PC manufacturer be responsible for providing Windows 7 updates? Even though the PC is beyond it's support date? Sure, I can increase the security by switching to another OS that is updated. It may even be a Windows clone. But if a software developer decided to only support "original, unmodified" PC configurations, that would be within their right. trparky But it can be adapted to run LineageOS. Sudev There is bit difference in analogy here: OnePlus manufactured the phone and Cynogen Inc customized AOSP Android OS for it, they didn't developed it from ground up. I understand that Cynogen INC is out of business now too. However in PC world, it would be the case that you purchased a PC from Dell and get Microsoft Windows OS with some additional Dell software. If Dell or developer of that custom software goes out of business you still get OS update for your PC. Its not android OS itself out business here. Adrian and for the record, I absolutely agree that it was the content providers and not all on Netflix. trparky You should be demanding that OnePlus send an official update to your device. So what if your device is old? It should be still supported. Windows 7 is still supported nearly eight years later, why can't your device be supported for that long as well? Plumplam Who cares except for a bunch of XDA nerds? If it means better security then I'm all for it. Dmitri Smirnov Well, for starters, it doesn't mean better security, since it does nothing to address the problems with vulnerable outdated android versions that will be "certified", but will allow malicious apps to quietly escalate their privileges and do their dirty work, but will block "uncertified" custom roms that actually have all the recent secuirity patches and give user full control over who has root access and how. Also, "bunch of XDA nerds" are the source of a lot of features that had their trial run in custom ROMs and then were adopted to the AOSP. Should I remind you of "The Oak and the Pig" fable? Alienate the developers bringing new ideas to the ecosystem - lose the competetive edge you had over other OSes saf1927 Actually, custom ROMs never really have the latest security patches despite what they claim since kernels aren't maintained and no proprietary blobs is updated anymore. If ROM developers were OEMs, they'd be violating their agreements with Google by bumping the patch level without actually addressing all the vulnerabilities. Dmitri Smirnov Well they patch the AOSP to the same level as latest official one and kernel - if it's possible to do so without breaking the compatibility with compiled blobs or at least on the level of latest official firmware. So in the end run it's at least as secure as the official firmware, often - much more so. saf1927 If you look at the security bulletin, most vulnerabilities come from proprietary drivers and require these to be updated. On a supported device, these are provided by the chip manufacturers to the OEMs, on an unsupported device they aren't updated anymore. A custom ROM can only fix userspace security issues. In the end, bumping the patch level without addressing all vulnerabilities in that patch gives a false sense of security to users. Dmitri Smirnov If anything, this is an argument for forcing OEMs to opensource their blobs. For some reason community is much better at releasing the fixes for what they can change (userspace), while OEMs generally stop caring as soon as device is out the door. saf1927 The problem goes beyond OEMs unfortunately. All the phones you can buy are assembled with off-the-shelf components that they buy from other manufacturers and it is them that provide the binary blobs to the OEMs. If they stop supporting components, the OEMs can't do anything. For the chip, it's companies like Qualcomm, Samsung, Mediatek etc. that need to support it with up-to-date drivers. Once they stop, the life-cycle of a phone comes to an end. trparky And that is probably one of many reason why Qualcomm is facing a nice fat anti-trust lawsuit. Serves them right. trparky That ain't ever going to happen. There's no way they're going to allow for their intellectual property to be open for all the world to see and have it cracked open. It would be corporate suicide since their competitors would be able to reverse engineer their stuff. Suicide_Note Never heard of "The Oak and the Pig" before. Could you tell me more? Seriously. Dmitri Smirnov http://www.aliceswonderland.eu/Alice-ska350-en.html Maxr1998 Ah, Lessing. Going to read the original version in a minute :) username_not_valid Thats a very generous view of the custom ROM community. It might be true of a few, very few devs, but most ROMs are unsupported garbage with serious security issues. Dmitri Smirnov Maybe so, but out of this cesspool of garbage CyanogenMod was born, which became LineageOS. I'd say their quality standard appeals me more than a lot of OEMs. username_not_valid Cyanogen and Lineage was what i had in mind.. Each to his own i guess. BAlGaInTl Yes and no. I run Lineage on my OnePlus One because Cyanogen OS is no longer supported. I can say with certainty that Lineage introduces stability issues that I have to deal with to be up to date. Wilton Daniel Pinto Ninna pooty bewarci Qwip Consider the bigger picture. Right now, users are being shuffled into a situation where they must restrict the control they have over their device if they want to be able to use Netflix (and presumably banking apps will follow soon). That may seem fine, and from some security perspective it is probably a good thing. How much control do you have over your _laptop_? How much do you want? Right now, we're blissfully able to install unsigned software on our computers (although various OSs will complain about it), but will that last? How long will it be before we can only open our banking interface on our laptop using a trusted, digitally signed browser on a machine that is using secure boot and can only run signed binaries? I can understand the direction that Netflix (and others) are coming from, and to them it may even make sense. The question is: what is the cost of ceding control over our devices/machines in order to be able to watch netflix, etc. trparky Yeah and that's why Windows is the virus filled cesspool that it is today. Windows 10 is slowly changing Windows to be an app store based ecosystem in which all apps will be sandboxed. It's coming to the desktop near you. saf1927 I hope Magisk (or other similar mods in the future) keep working, so to prevent this. Not a problem on my Pixel XL since I haven't rooted it, but on my Nexus 5 Magisk allows it to pass Safety Net even though it's running a custom ROM (7.1.2) and it's rooted. Hendrik Leppkes SafetyNets primary purpose is to secure devices for Android Pay, and when you deal with actual money transactions on your device, you really don't want any hack interfering with it - so I'm quite certain they'll do whatever they can to break hacks like this and ensure the security and integrity of the device. h4rr4r No, its primary purpose is to make the device trustworthy for others not the person who paid for it. This is how it makes it "secure" for android pay. You are a possible threat and this closes that. Suicide_Note It would seem that Google is erecting a wall around their garden, too. EowynCarter While Apple opens iOS more and more. YouNex According to the support/help page, a device is not certified if it stops getting Android updates. How fuck up is that ? I don't get it. My Moto X has always been on stock ROM, yet it's showing up as non certified. Yes it's rooted + system modifications, but at no point is it stated that root prevents it from being certified. Suicide_Note Really? You can't understand why your rooted/system modified device is non-certified? YouNex I know how to read, but this is vague https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/b6f710b8628f0e09ab73ba144c133a2c9b1fe1325b353ae7dc1636f2776b2ac0.png "Not secure" jonzey231 Root and/or unlocked bootloader = Not certified. YouNex It says nothing about root or bootloader https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/b6f710b8628f0e09ab73ba144c133a2c9b1fe1325b353ae7dc1636f2776b2ac0.png ast00 Can't wait until LastPass excludes root users... Fuck them. Adonis K. If they do, I'm cancelling my subscription... Naxx ENVY Fuck them and yet they haven't done anything yet ... #internetlogic Also i know right , crazy for a company that stores your passwords to make themselves more secure . ABSOLUTE CRAZY , RAGE RAGE RAGE Jordan Palmer I don't understand your reasoning or rationale for these two statements. ast00 The second part is related to Google. Sorry about the confusion. Believe it or not, most of us root users keep SELinux in it's Enforcing state. This means we are safe. Nothing gets root rights without us knowing. Our phones are just as safe if not safer than most stock phones. JATIN BANSAL SafetyNet test can be passed using Magisk Manager. I am using it and it works fine for me. Even in play store, my device is certified. May be this helps someone. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/3756499ff5876545740cd0e88e38961bb2c327d90fc43f5801f4bce5d802c990.png https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/44185f640490cb506a68a3414579bd345123f7d52ee2e11802d31d5141db11ae.png Nick Most people are worried about the future when the exploits that Magisk uses are patched and it continues to make it harder for people to get around this. JATIN BANSAL That's what I am also worried about. I just posted this for those who are already rooted and for now want to keep the root. My main purpose of rooting was to flash lineage OS. I think custom rom is the only way of staying updated to latest version of Android as google itself doesn't update their phones after 2 years (18 months I think) for reasons they have. I think if someone buys a flagship device which costs 700$+, it should have 3-4 years of full software update support. 😆😄 2 years of major OS version updates and 3 years of security patches. After 3 years, its time to buy a new phone cuz its so old anyway. trparky Says you! Windows 7 was released on July 22, 2009 and they still support it EIGHT YEARS LATER! And they plan on supporting it until the year 2020 which means it will be supported for a total of ELEVEN YEARS! If Microsoft can do it, Google can too!!! Does Microsoft suddenly say "Your machine is too old, go buy a new one"? No, they continue to give you Windows Updates for years later. We should also be demanding that the Android OEMs do so as well. A Samsung Note 5 has more than enough hardware in it to run Android 7 but no... we can't do that, we need to make money so we don't update them to force you to buy a new device. Lambdadelta Magisk...alright, thanks for the tip-off. I really must get it. TadMSTR Magisk doesn't always pass SafetyNet. I have some devices it fails on. However, several other devices it works just fine. Make sure you turn on the hide root option, it's off by default. Lambdadelta Well, I do have a problem, and that is my device is not able to download it directly from Google Play, so I have to get the APK from XDA. I dunno why this is the case for my phone though. Is it because it's a 4.4.4? Either way, I'll get the APK moved to my phone later tonight. Teodor Axel Johan Jönsson I have activated hide root option, and it passes SafetyNet, but in Google Play Store, it still shows uncertified. What app should I hide root from to get Play Store to show Certified? JATIN BANSAL As per XDA: Q: Safety Net fails after enabling MagiskHide A: Magisk can only hide Magisk core features, for Magisk modules it depends on what the module does. If your ROM itself is not able to pass SafetyNet, then there is nothing Magisk can help. Your best bet is 100% stock ROMs, because your phone manufacturer is forced to release a device passing CTS. Teodor Axel Johan Jönsson What in Magisk Hide did you check/how did you do it? Google Play Store? Or Play services? Because here it says uncertified :( JATIN BANSAL Just clear app data of play store. Now it will show your device certified Teodor Axel Johan Jönsson Thanks! Muzaffar I believe that root and custom rom makes android what it is now. This feels like betrayal for Android enthusiast. username_not_valid Well maybe in the very early days (maybe), but not any more. Rooted phones make up a tiny fraction of active devices. Muzaffar It's not about active devices. It's about how android develop together with community (well as i remember) I believe that those "rooted user" contribute many things that make android right now. I still remember status bar (and nav bar) color change was implemented on Kitkat before it becomes official on lollipop. Also, we can't forget how badly mobile active network bug happens in lollipop if it's not those "rooted user" who found out the fix via xposed. and i believe there are still more. trparky We can blame the OEMs for that kind of stuff because of things like locked bootloaders, eFuses, etc. username_not_valid Or we can blame ROM makers for it because they kept breaking the devices causing warranty claims. Naxx ENVY no offence but that's small thinking ... i'd say 90% of people on Android devices don't want or even know about root, heck it may even be 95% ... security is more of a concern, sure it annoys us geeks, but that's the 5% at most. Muzaffar And about half of android devices is left outdated. Not to mention bugs that unsolved on previous android. I'll pick a dumb phone instead, if android becomes a closed platform. trparky And truth be told that's why I have an iPhone. I simply got sick and tired of the lack of updates so I told myself I'm going to the iPhone and have been happy ever since. OK sure, it may not have all of the customization features that Android has but I can be guaranteed that I will get software and security updates on time, every time, regardless of my carrier of choice. refthemc I think you misread his comment, he's saying that root and custom roms got Android to where it is TODAY not saying that it is necessary TODAY. And I agree. trparky It pretty much comes down to this. Google is simply targeting a much larger piece of the pie. You can't blame them for trying to do what is necessary to protect not only the platform but the Android brand itself. Qwip Well, it isn't like there is anywhere else to go though, is it? Google can basically throw enthusiasts who have promoted and fostered android development under the bus - they don't need them any more. trparky Money trumps community. Always has, always will. username_not_valid Ad blocking was the last holdout reason to root for me, but even thats no longer a good reason with things like Adhell, Adguard etc I have no other reason to root now, custom ROMs are generally garbage, and bloat can usually be uninstalled or disabled, so its just not needed. Adonis K. custom ROMs have nothing to do with root... thevigilante Custom ROMs have uncertified flag in Play Store Mike Avellanosa Not all, though George Byers My Nexus 7 2013 is passing safteynet running Lineage unrooted. Wilton Daniel Pinto Let me guess, you have a Pixel. Or you wouldn't call custom ROMs bloated while the reality is other way round username_not_valid Wouldn't touch a Pixel actually. username_not_valid Should be noted that I didn't call custom ROMs bloated, I guess you misread it. Wilton Daniel Pinto Oh yeah, I misread it . My bad Zach Mauch This is going to cause the same problem I see in governments work with security. They will blindly block things like root and bootloader unlock regardless of if it poses any credible threat because it FEELS more secure. Blah!!!!!! Naxx ENVY it IS more secure, not just " feels" h4rr4r More secure for them, not for me the owner of the device. Besides, not even for them in the long term. An up to date ROM has many exploits patched that a two versions out of date and 12 months behind on security patches OTA has. Zach Mauch What I mean is they will apply restrictions because they easily can and it gives a warm fuzzy for them. They will do this regardless of the impact to the user. The analogy here is that in my job I am constantly unnecessary restrictions and bureaucracy that make doing my job much more difficult. For instance, we are disallowed from using remote desktop on standalone computer networks. It would make our job MUCH MUCH easier in many circumstances and save money on software as I could remote into my PC from anywhere in the building. Yet they deny us that and claim security. jonzey231 So this will force people to install apps from unauthorized sources, thus making the whole Android malware issue that much more prevalent. Great.. Suicide_Note Unless being held at gunpoint, no one is forced to install apps from unauthorized sources. That's a user's CHOICE. jonzey231 You know what I mean. Stop playing devil's advocate on everyone's posts. Eric Braun He's not incorrect. Kyle R Krcmaric "Stop providing an alternate viewpoint to my own." It's just comments. Anyway, I think Google also announced that even sideloaded apps will get scanned by their new Google Play Protect service, which may help nullify the risk of sideloading in the first place. d0x360 That's not an alternate viewpoint unless your view is "don't install any apps ever" There is no logical argument to defend this move by Google. None. username_not_valid Yes there is. Come content creators will not allow a provider to support a rooted or otherwise compromised device. Right or wrong in your eyes thats the reality, and in order for Android to be able to have such services Google have to do this. d0x360 What you said isn't an alternate viewpoint lol you are just repeating the reason Google is doing this which everyone agrees is a fact. As for this new comment...a rooted phone isn't compromised. Tell me...what would a rooted user do with Netflix that would make Netflix want to block them? Are they worried about people copying movies because if they think Android is the vector for that action they are idiots. All they are doing is making a problem by allowing bad actors to inject malware into a Netflix apk that could be installed by both root and unrooted users. Genius! Give me 1 good reason to block rooted phones from an app like oh I dunno, Mario run or whatever it's called. Any answers you give are false. Wanna know why? Hacked apks exist to allow cheating and they can be installed by anyone rooted or not. In fact I'd stake my life that your average unrooted user is installing more modified apk files to cheat in games or whatever than any rooted user. People who root are generally better educated about the Android eco system and do less dumb stuff. As for Netflix I cancelled my account on the day they did this and now I just use a friends account so they lost a subscriber due to this move and I rarely ever used the app. Sure 1 person closing an account that's existed since the day they opened isn't going to do much but I vote with my wallet and if a company does something I dislike then they simply don't get my money. The first person I asked gave me their login info and I made a profile. It's just like how I share my HBO subscription with someone else. Easy easy. username_not_valid See my previous comment. Its not for me to argue, the fact is content providers want it, fair or not, end of story, therefore its going to happen. The tiny number of rooters out there are meaningless to them, and Google. Netflix has to do this because the providers of its non-original content demand it. Its not Netflix fault, they either do it or lose shows. Losing large amounts of their content would affect their subscription base several orders of magnitude more than losing rooted users, who chances are, use the service on more than their phone or tablet anyway. d0x360 Once again I ask... what about a rooted device is dangerous to an app and also this is now a second question, what makes it compromised? BAlGaInTl Clearly you've made up your mind on the issue, but I'll give it a go. It isn't necessarily the root that is dangerous to an app or vice versa. The compromise comes from other apps/processes that can take advantage of root. If you don't understand that, then you don't understand what root really is. It has a lot of valuable uses, but it can also be dangerous. To address your previous statement, just because it rubs me the wrong way. So your "solution" was to cancel your Netflix account and then steal the content? So clearly, you aren't "actually" affected by the change, because you can still watch Netflix. You do realize that watching their content is also valuable to them and makes them money? If you want to boycott Netflix for their practices, then by all means do. Otherwise, it just comes across as hypocritical IMHO. d0x360 I don't believe I asked you. No I'm not stealing Netflix content, it's being paid for and Netflix has many times in the past encouraged account sharing. Of course they did so in the hopes you would join but they still allow it. I paid my Netflix dues. Day 1 4 disc member, then as soon as it was available I upgraded to the 4k 4 user package. It's not piracy either, I'm not recording or distributing the content. If Netflix wants to dick with me I'll dick with them. I never said this was permanent but I vote with my wallet. Vote cast. I also haven't used Netflix once since that day despite being able to. I've been using Amazon and Microsoft video where I own over 500 movies so you can stuff the whole theft argument. I've bought more content than most and that doesn't include my DVD, Blu-ray, and uhd Blu-ray collection which is well over 1400 movies and TV shows at this point. Your right...I've been rooting since the first Android phone but I totally don't understand the possibilities. My argument is simple. The overwhelming majority of root users don't mess with apps. To hell with that nonsense argument anyways. What is the danger to Netflix? Copying movies? Please...it's a million times easier to do it on a PC. Even windows xp can handle it without issue. Does Netflix and you I suppose really think root users are using the app to steal content? If so how? Show me one forum topic, one article, one modified Netflix apk that allows downloading and bypassing their drm. I'm begging you. Just 1. BAlGaInTl I reviewed the Netflix TOS, and I will agree that you are not stealing. I'll even remove the verbiage from my post. Netflix does not make any such stipulation. They speak only of the "Account Owner" and "Devices." I guess I just assumed that, and that's my bad. As I've said in other posts... It isn't all about Netflix. A large part of it is about their content. They really can't argue that point with providers. You either play by their rules, work to establish new rules, or choose not to carry them. Netflix wants to stay relevant on all platforms. That's the main danger to Netflix. In addition, I shouldn't have to give an example in the wild of an exploit. Just because it is difficult to find doesn't mean it doesn't exist. What if someone else writes an app that uses root to mine user account data from Netflix? Should Netflix not be worried about protecting user data? If that happens, who is responsible for the security and the bad press? Probably not Netflix, but they would certainly be impacted. I checked my app really quick (which is stuck on version 4 because I'm affected). Since Netflix keeps you logged in for convenience (that's spelled out in their terms), a quick look gives my full name, username, phone number, zip code, the brand of payment card, and the last 4 digits of that card. That's quite a bit of information that can easily be gathered by a piece of Malware. Now as I said... Netflix probably wouldn't be liable if a user was compromised because of root. It would certainly be a danger to their business however. Why should the be asked to take that risk? It seems to me that they are approaching this in a realistic manner, and rolling it out in a reasonable way. Would this affect the majority of root users? Probably not. By their nature, root users will find ways around it anyway. The problem is that the impact to Netflix from losing content and/or a compromised app is disproportionate the loss of blocking root users. It's simply a numbers game, and you can't blame Netflix for that. And you certainly can't blame Google who is trying to improve security. username_not_valid Thats not for me to decide, or argue, the fact is the content providers have decided that rooting is a risk to their copyrighted content, and as such services like Netflix, Amazon, and other streaming services must comply and lock out rooted devices. Passing safetynet and using Googles DRM framework is the easiest way to claim due diligence, so thats what they will do, and in order to keep Android competitive Google is providing the tools needed to make it possible. What I will argue though is that your notion that custom ROMs etc are more secure is unfounded. The best might well be, but there are hundreds of completely random and unchecked ROMs out there that could contain absolutely anything, you cant possibly claim that custom ROMs are inherently safer or more secure than OEM ROMs, outdated or not. jonzey231 So let's play this out: If someone takes the Netflix .apk and mods it with malware and then signs it, it will pass installation on the device. 1. User opens app. 2. App does whatever shitty thing it's designed to do while the user thinks they just got around the block. 3. The OS scans the app and warns the user it's been modified and they should uninstall it. 4. User thinks "Ha! I know and that's why it works!" 5. User keeps app until they get a call from Credit Karma that their identity was probably stolen but they don't know how. 6. Person spends 6 months fixing stolen identity. But still uses that app the whole time. Ultimately, that user is still going to be screwed. Would you or I make this mistake? No. Would your cousin's friend's dad because he had his son root so he could tether for free and overheard you guys talking about sideloading apps and googled how to do it? Yes. Randroid Problem is, even in your scenario, root has nothing to do with it. Someone who is not rooted could do the same thing. The only problem is, now MORE people who root are going to be *forced* to look for a modified apk because the official apk is not available from the Play Store. So in the end, it's causing more problems than it's fixing. Corbin Baxter Here's the thing about rooting: when you alter your devices software like that, then Google shouldn't be responsible for anything that comes afterwards for the user. This just helps discourage rooting, which can alter a new users perspective on Android, or make someone reconsider getting an Android device. someone755 For what it's worth, back in 2011/2010, many of us bought into Android *because* we could root. Imagine the possibilities of being in control of so much more of your system than with any mobile OS prior; We've spent hundreds (some, thousands) of dollars in this environment, on devices, apps, books etc. I understand this isn't how things stand nowadays, but root is still prevalent because of one issue that Google will not fix (or at least, won't until O+ is running on the majority of devices, but that'll take two years at the minimum), and those are updates and vendor apps (i.e. bloatware). If my phone is stuck on Lollipop I'm going to root it; I'll be able to mitigate the memory leak performance drops, and overall customize the device to fit my specific needs -- I've made quite a few friends (think ROM and kernel devs) because I just wanted to put a thermal engine better than Qualcomm's horrendous MPDecision into the kernel directly (i.e. I took the kernel source and modified it to fit my needs). What Google is trying to do here is, yes, discourage rooting, but instead of fixing the root cause (heh) behind why people root in the first place (that is, again, customizability and personal(ized) performance tuning, in large part to keep devices on older Android versions alive), root wouldn't be necessary. In the long run this *might* fix the symptom, but it most definitely will not help in fixing the cause. And that's because the cause is Google itself. As if apps like Snapchat blocking power users from their apps wasn't enough, now there's this -- If it becomes so common that even Google's own apps start to utilize the feature, I'll be gone to another mobile platform within a month. That might mean iOS, it might mean S60v3, I'll know that if (or rather, when) it happens. tl;dr: Google is putting a band-aid on a shotgun wound. Corbin Baxter I'm speaking mainly for new Android users. They don't feel as comfortable rooting. Doing this makes Android SEEM more like iOS. This doesn't MAKE Android like iOS. New users are comfortable with that. This is the same issue Microsoft had with Windows 8/8.1. Classic users, and Windows enthusiasts, hated someone changing the way they would use their computers. Microsoft introduced a different way of doing things, and to enthusiasts, it was bad, no matter how good it might be. Google's Project Treble should mostly fix the fragmentation problem, therefore giving Android users one less reason to root. To us enthusiasts, nothing can beat rooting, but it might not be the best solution to the problems Android has. Google seems intent on fixing the problems rooting tries to solve, but in a higher-quality and reliable way. No hard feelings😉 trparky They won't understand that, they're too blinded by their geek rose colored glasses. Corbin Baxter I don't expect everyone to understand, but I'll be happy if even a small handful understand what Google is doing here. Dmitri Smirnov > when you alter your devices software like that, then Google shouldn't be responsible for anything that comes afterwards for the user. As if right now Google or the OEMs are in any ways responsible for the malware or unpatched firmware vulnerabilities that stay this way for year. But yes, the users that root are the problem. Corbin Baxter For unrooted phones, yes Google and OEMs are very responsible. But after you root, Android loses most of its security and stability, and rooting is basically tinkering with core system files. Google doesn't have any control over what the user can or can't do after that. bekifft That wasn't even a devil's advocate, that was a straight up strawman. Frosted Butts Yes.. please tell me about all the Netflix alternatives i can install, that can legally stream from Netflix...... Right now, if i am rooted and want Netflix (a service i am paying for), i must go through 3rd party app stores to install the APK. There is no choice at all... R Firestone ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ Umm you have the choice to unroot your device. Maxr1998 ..which is a bad choice for many. d0x360 Yes you do except I rooted my device to make it MORE secure. Unrooting would make my device less secure than sideloading apps would. username_not_valid People can keep saying that, but the content providers have no way to know whether or not you have taken measures to secure your custom device, whereas if they go down this root they know its handled. BAlGaInTl "whereas if they go down this root they know its handled" I see what you did there. 😆😄 ...or just watch Netflix from Chrome! You could even do this from a Linux box with root! 😃 Suicide_Note Sure there is: unroot. Problem solved. neoKushan "I've solved this problem by creating 3 more problems - but it IS solved!" Eric Braun https://www.amazon.com/Netflix-Inc/dp/B005ZXWMUS Option C .. ?? h4rr4r A choice that is now more popular. dcdttu It's not so much about what a user chooses to do. It's about probability. The probability that sites are going to try to lure users into downloading malware-infected Netflix APKs from 3rd party sites is going to go up if you can't download it from a safe source in the first place. This is just like the fact that, if you don't give drug users a safe and clean place to shoot up, they're going to go do it somewhere else that's much more dangerous. Both of these scenarios are bad for society in general, no matter what the original intention was. kgptzac 1/10. Gotta try harder. Premsuraj How? Google Play Protect will still catch malicious apps makapav Yes but you're potentially making people venture through shady sites to get the APKs. Eric Braun Or to Amazons App store or Fdroid. The people going to shady sites are already going there, this isn't going to increase the traffic by any real amount. tehboogieman Are you sure that Google will continue allowing GPP for unlocked or rooted users going forward? Not to mention that it's not a silver bullet for 0days d0x360 It barely works as is. There are tons of apps that slip through every day. Krebs on security reports on them quite frequently. I don't trust Google's scanning of apps at all which is why I root. I can make my phone more secure and I can also image the device as often as I want so if something does happen it's fixed within 5 min. If I unroot then I lose the protection along with the backups. Premsuraj Custom ROMs and root can't protect from 0days either. And just out of curiosity how is root going to provide more security? If anything it makes the device less secure tehboogieman Nobody said root makes a device more secure. Blocking root users from downloading apps from the Play Store puts users at more risk since those users will be more inclined to sideload apps from sources that might not be as reliable as the Play Store. Premsuraj The only people who cares about this are the people who root. And those user's generally tend to be more knowledgeable about what kind of apps and app stores they can trust. ASYOUTHIA✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ And only <2% of users will do this to keep rooted. xxTheGoDxx Only the plus 50 - 100 Million users that have root: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=eu.chainfire.supersu ASYOUTHIA✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ You do realize that that's just downloads right? ...not active users. blindexecutioner I'm not mad. I continue to use things like magisk to help get around stuff like this. All this will do is encourage me to use unauthorized sources for offending apps if magisk ever stops working. There is a reason I use Android over iOS and it certainly isn't because the apps are better designed or whatever. brian. Magisk is a good way around this. However, I don't know how long this will last. I would think with security in mind and developers trying to monetize more, it will put pressure on Google to make SafetyNet get triggered much easier. Obviously, I don't have any way of knowing, but this could easily turn into a cat and mouse game more than it already is. Android Pay was first, other apps did it like Super Mario Run, which who cares, but now Netflix? Changes are coming, and it doesn't look good for the rooting community. D13H4RD2L1V3 I'm not sure if everyone gets why some of us went through the trouble of gaining SU access. Sure, maybe there's a few who went through all that trouble for nefarious purposes (and maybe that got regulatory bodies concerned to the point where Google even needed to consider this) but from my perspective at least, a lot of us gain Superuser access mainly to get features that we liked on other Android flavors, especially in the case of a build of Android that's very close to Google's vision. Such as the ability to hide the navbar at any time we wanted and also to gain theming support (which I feel should be added officially sooner rather than later because I absolutely hate how Google is making their already-bright UI even more eye-searing with even more white-colored elements, which also makes the benefits of OLED much less obvious). I wouldn't be as concerned if these features were pushed to AOSP soon, but as it stands, I feel that Google should probably think about making these features available soon. Marty Thank the bad apples for why you no longer have freedom. Jeremy ディリマ Would changing region firmware with Odin flag the SafetyNet check on Samsung mobiles? Soz if it's a stupid question a lot has changed since I last fiddled with Android Christopher Robert This was a long time coming. Once root user started using root to pirate software, and/or get around geo locks, instead of using it to add feature to their firmware or improve their devices performance, it was only a matter of time before it all got torn down. h4rr4r Get around geo locks? You mean have my device report the location I want it to report? Yeah, how terrible that I control what my computer does. dizel123 You still do. This doesn't affect that at all h4rr4r You said the justification for that was people using their devices for their own reasons in the way they liked. I was pointing out that this is a normal thing and not something that should be punished. Cuvis You don't need root to pirate. You never did. Marty Apple says, Thank you. h4rr4r Sounds like we need a new FREE platform. Maybe Amazon can use this to push their store. mxwp but will the Netflix from the Amazon App Store work on rooted phones? Curt RIP Root. I'm not moving from stock anymore, just cab with the hassle. Until there's a 'reliable' way to hide from Safety Net, I'll enjoy my Android Pay, banking apps and overall smoothness. (If it was up to me, I'd be rooted with Linage) h4rr4r IOS is the platform for you. That was the deal from the beginning. hp-fourtwenty magisk....giyf .y phone is rooted with lineage 14.1, and passes safetynet. problem solved! jcopernicus Fantastic news. Lawstorant All this butthurt for what? You all sound like Magisk doesn't exist. Dave Hamilton Lets take Apple and there closed source. Lets take Google and there open source, the freedom to do and change as you please to make the device yours. No two devices have to be the same. Lets get 115 million android users, and then start deciding you no longer have this choice and freedom to do what you want! When something gets better and better, its only a matter of time before all the things you love are removed and comersilised Eric Braun You still have the option to do what you want. However like everything there are reactions for every action. Want to root or unlock your device? Sure, however there may be a few apps that no longer appear in the playstore. May want to have a backup like Amazon App Store or something similar ready. No one is stopping you, feel free to do as you please. tehboogieman Man, if I have to choose between having a device with root or a device with apps that use day to day, the iPhone goes from a 1% chance of being my daily driver to about 50% There are still a lot that can Android can do that iOS can't, but if I'm living in a walled garden the iPhone is looking pretty attractive. 5+ years of official OS support, solid retail network for quick service or hardware exchanges. The Play Store is my main source of apps that I know are vetted and generally safe. I have no desire to manage app updates manually. There is always a chance that someone will build and maintain an appstore that will have all root blocked apps (maybe the future of APKMirror?). If not it might be the death of Android for users like me Eric Braun Even without all of this I would use an APKMirror App that allowed for updating of apps automatically. dizel123 Google gives app developers more control over their apps. Whiny entitled internet crybabies go on the internet and whine and cry. Aka...Thursday neoKushan Alternatively: Google restricts users from using their device, which they own, how they see fit. dizel123 Except Google isn't restricting anyone from doing anything. But being 100% wrong has never stopped anyone in the internet NubCake being an asshole (in your case) hasn't stopped anyone from commenting eather it seems. dizel123 I can admit to being an asshole. But I'm also right so it's all good. neoKushan It's certainly not stopping you. dizel123 I haven't experienced it so of course it's not stopping me trparky You may own the hardware but you don't own the software, you only have a license to use it. Csöpi Thats so greate. I have a stock oneplus one and for some strange reasons i was failing the test beforhand, but now its all green. Still cant update the netflix app hence chromecast isnt working either anymore. Not really happy. JC If there's a will there's a way. brian. If more developers get on board with this, I can't see why I would switch to Android. I've always been curious about new Android phones, bought a bunch and rooted them all if I could. This is not good for a person like me. d0x360 If Google keeps this up and app devs include the api to block rooted phones then my days using Android will be over and Google will have lost a user who's been there since the g1. I don't know what I'd switch to... probably windows mobile because I'm not a fan of apple whatsoever. It's really a shame because if I had to guess I'd say 99.99% of people who root do so for either the added security and or customized experiences. For example I use root to modify my status bar and quick panel as well as firewall my apps and use adaway and yes Google I do whitelist sites that aren't obnoxious with their ads. John Doe All the more reason for the APK mirror appstore LoL Jan-Lk Else Yeah Google want's us to buy tooooo expensive phones to just get the latest Android, because cheap phones suck at updates and so they need to be flashed and rooted... trparky But if the community raises holy hell with the OEMs then maybe it will be corrected. There's no damn reason why a three year old device can't be updated when an eight year old Windows 7 machine is still receiving Windows Updates. McStagger WHY DOES NETFLIX CARE IF THE PHONE IS ROOTED?!?!?!?! mxwp Netflix does not care, but the content creators that make the stuff you see on Netflix do care. They care because they are idiots who think it is easier to pirate from rooted phones. bekifft Again, Google becomes more and more restrictive. I switched from iPhone because the screens were too small, and Google was far less restrictive. Both of those issues are now resolved, and Google's upped the price of their device to match Apple. May as well switch back to iPhone, Google seems to support it just as much as Android anyway. Luxferro Except it's not just rooted users! Any device with an unlocked bootloader. hp-fourtwenty Your comment sucks for misinforming users about what safetynet is....has NOTHING to do with unlocked bootloaders. Luxferro Sure it does. My Nexus 6P only has an unlocked bootloader, and Netflix disappeared from the play store after the last update. And I'm not the only one, so I suggest you do some reading. TechGuy22 more reason for me to pirate hey, have at it Matías Duarte I hope Netflix does the same with Jailbroken iOS devices. Why they do this btw? To prevent people recording their movies? You can do that with Windows.. Knowledgeborn Allah In all honesty, that'll probably never happen. Jailbreaking iOS opens the doors to a lot of customization on an iPhone, but the security issues are often minimal (with the exception being not having the latest software version). Jailbreaking is pretty much filtered through the Cydia platform. You don't have access to the entire system with a jailbreak. Rooting is completely different, because you can completely reshape the core OS. fbl Note : I don't work for Netflix so I can't comment for them. Possible causes : - the right holders might be pushing for this. I work on roughly the same product area and we don't implement DRM because we like them, we implement them because we contractually have to. -Netflix is tired of getting low notes because of crashes coming by shitty hacks in custom roms. Zach Mauch Anyone know how chromebooks will be affected by this? Will dev mode being enabled cause you to fail SafetyNet Checks? That is currently the only way to install apks on Chromebooks. Branko But Android AOSP!11 -Google 2011 How the times how changed. Wayne Randall ALT arguement, because I don't have time to read every comment... This doesn't limit me and my rooted N6P at all, this move limits how much money they (the devs and Google) are going to make. I can't buy it (the app or coins, or special characters, or bonus content, w/e) if I can't see it. Plain and simple. The important apps will still be there. No app is worth unroot. Block Project Fi from root though... weeeellll. I guess I'd unroot for that. mxwp yeah, only Netflix, banks, and big names will use these blocks. i am guessing most devs want as much exposure as possible. PVL_93_RU Google is actively trying to kill the modding community. Not the Custom ROM makers, but people who root and install Xposed. All because they compromise the security for Android Pay I fear the day root and Xposed apps start disappearing from the Play Store trparky If it comes to security vs being open, security will always win (or at least should always win). Eric Koop I had my Shaw Gateway app update yesterday and they changed it so it doesn't work if rooted. So I had to uninstall and find an APK online of an older version. Now it's just a matter of time before I forget and re-install the update. What a pain... disqus_em5YfkbWdk Well this would certainly get me to cancel Netflix. My personal Plex server is far better than Netflix could ever be anyway. Vivek Rameses Becoming apple more and more every day. Disgusting. Knowledgeborn Allah Android is starting to look more and more like iOS with each update... ¯_(ツ)_/¯ trparky Open platforms rarely stay open once the Benjamins start rolling in. hp-fourtwenty Go ahead and block me...I'll just pirate your app. Play nice and so will I. Start poking me and I'll poke back by never giving you another penny. App devs can't beat XDA devs. It's not going to happen. My unlocked, rooted, rommed and modded device still passes safety net. The day that stops, so does the flow of money leaving my hands on the play store. Luxferro Lay off the sodas.... UniBroW Question, can those of you without access to Netflix on Google play, can it be installed from the Amazon App Store? Stanley C. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/dd381b7e8a39df74c4725712a0db906098c965e9ee4194b6e01e020fd69ee566.png Thats how magisk is made... Magic! Marti Abernathey Yawn. I've got a rooted device and just installed Netflix... because? Magisk. As soon as they made this choice I cancelled. Not because I can't get around it, but because they make me do that. mrjayviper even on a non-rooted LOS mis 5s+, I cannot install Netflix. unlocking the bootloader already tripped safety. And I don't want to root. The features available in non-rooted LOS is enough for me. Teh BuG No. Bueno. TedPhillips Sigh. What's the over-under on this becoming pervasive in the play store... MicroG / Fdroid I'm coming soon. World needs a solid single alternative gcm replacement to catch on. TedPhillips As far as the potential for support overhead, being rooted is generally less than the pain coming from the Xposed/magisk crowd. You need to be actively interfering with an app via root vs code being injected into low levels of the framework that everything uses. TedPhillips I think the best outcome could be that Google opens up their process for little guys to certify there own rom builds, ala let's encrypt lowering friction on getting ssl setup. AOSP should not be a functionally useless base implementation for I'm roms, but something you can use in​ practice. TedPhillips Hey guys, don't worry. Google says Android is for everyone. https://www.android.com/everyone/ That includes AOSP developers too, right? That website seems to tread the line pretty carefully, ala 'no one is forcing you use Google play' but Hiroshi's quote seems like it comes with a grain of salt since he owns Play. I'd love to see AP interview him about this. qkjDlav As an app developer for a large app used globally, the two biggest time wasters in a developer's life are a) debugging device specific issues (HTC, Samsung, etc) and b) crash logs with Xposed in the stack trace. Developers are tired of having to sit around with device farms at their desks just to make sure new features and changes work with each quirky variant of Android that manufacturers want to deploy, and custom roms do make it worse. Enthusiasts are welcome to customize their own versions of Android and sideload apps, but we don't want to see crashlogs in the Developer Console from rooted/custom ROM users. And companies probably don't want to keep paying us to debug issues that only a small minority of users will see. Lê Nguyên Chương Most stupid thing I've ever heard in my life.

Here are all the Instant Apps announced at Google I/O Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/05/18 2:36pm PDTMay 18, 2017 39 Plus 1 on G+ 123 Share on Facebook 66 Share on Twitter Total Shares228 Google News Instant apps were announced one year ago at Google I/O 2016, but only now are they rolling out to a large amount of users. Now any developer can make instant apps, and Google showed off a massive list of them at a session earlier today (seen above). Some of the highlights include Vimeo for watching videos, Jet for shopping, Periscope for watching live streams, The Weather Channel, and even the New York Times crossword puzzle. Most of these already have mobile web app versions, but the point is that Instant Apps provide a native application experience. Even though the Instant Apps feature is already rolled out to me, I'm unable to use some of these, perhaps indicating that some are still in testing. For example, I couldn't get the Weather Channel or Periscope ones to work, but Vimeo and Jet did. Instant apps currently work on Android 6.0 or higher.

DieselBeats Basically the experience of the app without having to download it. It's moreso if you are really only going to use the app once so it's not just hogging up space on your phone and never being used. boop I now that much. I mean I've never been able to pull one up. Sruly J Do you have the Google Play Services for Instant Apps app installed? Michel S. weird, why can't I find that in the Play Store? (on Android O beta, en-US) Sruly J It's not available through the Play Store. Officially the app is supposed to roll out to devices in the background, with the same going for updates. It's available on APK Mirror though. Richard Riker in theory you should get a button when you google for the app. But it may be US only at the moment, having the location set to en-us doesn't help. And at least in the show-off at last years I/O you should have such a button in the play store too. But you'll have to have Play Services for Instant apps and activate them in the play services settings antonio cesar you must have a specific google play services called google play services for instant apps, it dosent come preloaded Jpx I remember when I was sent a zillow link from my girlfriend last month. It used instant apps and I freaked out. I was rambling to her like she had any idea what I was talking about. It is such a great feature, that really doesn't feel like a big deal. Which means its amazing. Sir_Brizz "amoutsn" Carson Saldanha "amountsn fo" Sir_Brizz LOL Total Insecurity XDD Total Insecurity XD Carson Saldanha I have instant apps enabled, but they don't show up in search results. (I'm on Google US btw) Renaud Lepage What the HELL is the CBC in there for? abqnm So if you're searching for something and the result points to the CBC, you get the instant app for CBC. Not only Canadians get news from the CBC. Say, for example if you're from the US, you probably won't have the app installed, but you may get a CBC news story or such in your search results, so by providing an instant app, the user gets mostly the same experience as they would if they had the app installed. Renaud Lepage I know the why, I'm Canadian. I'm just surprised they actually gave enough of a shit to do an Instant App. abqnm Alright, point. But it's not like the instant apps are hard if you already have an app. I guess maybe they are focusing on engagement in search more now. That's really what these are. skillfulshoe I keep catching my phone "downloading" an update but it is for instant apps and the notification disappears within a second. Anyone know what is happening? Corbin Davenport That's the support library/APK for instant apps updating. skillfulshoe I've seen it do that about 5 times in the past few days. Anyways, thanks for the answer! Mike in KC I've noticed the same thing on my phone as well. Ozl Awesome, i cant wait to ditch my iPhone for a new Pixel 2.0 whenever they are available xD Jack Smith Two of us. Looking forward to getting a Pixel 2. Just hope I can get my hands on one. Ozl Yes, ill be there waiting to click that buy button on day one xD mehmehmeh I have noticed that since I switched back from iPhone to the S8+ that app updates seem smaller. Did they change how apps are updated in the 6ish months I was away from Android? iFeign Delta updates http://www.androidpolice.com/2016/07/23/new-play-store-tools-help-developers-to-shrink-the-size-of-app-updates/ patkoscsaba So. I have Google Play services for Instant Apps installed. I am also a beta user for Google App. How do I get an instant app? Can someone provide a step by step example with a an existing app? iAndroHacker Mine installed instant-apps services for a month ago but how do i use it? Nate Harris Pretty sure Instant Apps are supposed to work all the way back to KitKat. They specifically demoed it on KitKat at last year's I/O BlackeyeX2 Better yet, post links for each one so we can try it out...

Suggested Sharing will use machine learning to suggest people you might want to share your photos with, based on who appeared in them. Once shared with friends and family, they will be able to see the photos and add their own to the collection as well. Shared Libraries enables you to automatically share photos with one other person. You can set this up to share your entire photo library, all photos from a specific date or, perhaps more usefully, all photos of a specific person. Both Suggested Sharing and Shared Libraries will appear under a new Sharing tab on iOS, Android, and the Web app in the coming weeks. In addition to these decidedly digital options, Google also announced that they’re getting into a more… classic photo sharing method: Photo Books. Google Photos photo book creator will give you a quick way to get your images printed and bound in a soft- or hard-cover book. Google claims that their app will help find the ‘best’ photos, eliminating duplicates and poor quality images, helping you put together a photo book in no time at all. Photo Books has already rolled out in the U.S. on Web, and will appear on iOS and Android devices next week. A 20-page softcover book will set you back $10, while a hardcover is $20. Google has said that this feature will be available in other countries in the future, but have not yet set a date.

Let's face it: emoji, once the realm of tweens, have gone mainstream. They're popping up everywhere in society, from speech therapy to the debate over gun control. So it comes as little surprise that Google spent more than a year redesigning every one of the hundreds of emoji it offers in an attempt to make more of its users happy. The redesign process, detailed in an article in Fast Company this week, took so long in part because Google's current set of emoji appear very different from the round ones you'll find on the internet or messages on your iPhone. To many people, Google's current blob-shaped emoji, which you'll find everywhere from Hangouts conversations to the Android keyboard, look ugly. Plus, Google says, their asymmetric shape makes it increasingly difficult to implement new emoji from the Unicode Consortium, which is the de facto authority for deciding which emoji should exist. Related How to Get the Best Emoji on Your Android Phone How to Get the Best Emoji on Your Android Phone "Our design system wasn't equipped to provide standards that unified the look and feel of all the illustrations across the many emoji categories," Google explained in a blog post. So its designers came up with a new grid-based design that more closely resembles the emoji you currently see outside of the Google ecosystem. That means classic emoji like smiley faces are circular, and even the ones that aren't still fit into the same grid space, without the divisive spillover effect of the old blobs. The new emoji are also more compatible with other operating systems. Google explained that "we wanted to assure the user that when they sent an emoji to a friend, the message was clearly communicated regardless of whether they are on iOS, Windows, Samsung, or any other platform." Even though the design work is mostly completed, it'll still be a while before Google customers get to use the new emoji. They'll be coming first to the new Android O operating system, which just entered its public beta phase and is several months away from a commercial rollout. In the meantime, apps like Textra offer options for people who really want to get rid of the blobs as soon as possible Back to top Previous : New Tool Could Liberate PCs Infected With WannaCry By Tom Brant Tom is PCMag's San Francisco-based news reporter.

Getty Images Share By Marty Swant| 7 hours ago Share In its bid to make the mobile web faster—and more profitable—Google is adding more capabilities to its accelerated mobile pages to help publishers make more money and users waste less battery power. At its annual I/O developer conference this week, Google unveiled several updates for its AMP (Accelerated Mobile Pages) Ads initiative, including the ability to add video ads, use less battery power and integrate more third-party measurement. Already, since first launching AMP early last year, more than 2 billion AMP pages have been created, according to Google, with an average load time of up to 5 seconds faster than other pages on the internet. Google is also adding new creative formats such as carousels, video parallax and ‘LightBox.’ In a blog post detailing the updates, Vamsee Jasti, a product manager for AMP Project, said the company now allows creative management platform Celtra to support ad creation. “Celtra’s AdCreator platform is already used by thousands of brands and publishers globally to build immersive, rich media ads,” Jasti said. “By integrating support for AMP Ads in this easy-to-use drag-and-drop software for creating ads, all of their customers can now easily create beautiful and fast AMP Ads.” In addition to the new formats, Google’s faster load times allow for less battery usage not only video but also for animated and automated ads. (The company said animated AMP ads drew 80 percent less power than others.) As part of the updated program, Google also is adding third-party accountability through a partnership with analytics platform Moat, which will support AMP Ads in the near future with real-time, multi-platform measurement. The addition could help marketers better understand how ads’ engagement rates improve when they’re faster and lighter. “Attention is the key to branding, and seamless ads and content that load quickly provide a better experience to capture that attention,” Jonah Goodhart, CEO and co-founder of Moat, said in Google’s blog post. “We’ve seen consumers respond negatively when faced with slow load times or a poor user experience. The AMP Ads initiative represents a huge step forward for the industry and consumers, and we’re proud to contribute independent measurement to the AMP Project’s ambitious plans to improve web experiences.” Share http://adweek.it/2q1Pydl copy Marty Swant @martyswant Marty Swant is a staff writer for Adweek.

By Stephanie Condon for Between the Lines | May 19, 2017 -- 12:00 GMT (05:00 PDT) | Topic: Mobile OS With the beta release of Android O, Google this week also rolled out a series of updates to its Android accessibility tools -- services, settings, and APIs that help people with disabilities use the mobile operating system. Designers should consider accessibility given that one in five people will have a disability in their lifetime, Patrick Clary, product manager on accessibility engineering, said at the Google I/O conference. That adds up to quite a few Android users, given there are now more than two billion active Android devices across the globe. Accessibility will also help Google extend the OS even farther: 80 percent of people living with disabilities come from the developing world, Clary said. At the same time, accessibility isn't just about helping the disabled. "Designing for accessiblity is designing for the widest range of abilities in the widest possible range of situations," Clary said. For example, a design for someone with a motor impairment will also help users who happen to have their hands occupied. Android's accessibility tools help users change the way they interpret content from their devices or customize the look and feel of their devices. TalkBack, for instance, enables a user to interact with their device using touch and spoken feedback. With BrailleBack, users can connect their phone to a handheld, refreshable braille display via Bluetooth. Switch Access is an alternative to the touch screen for users with limited mobility. One new feature with Android O is a way to adjust the "accessibility" volume on TalkBack separately from media volume. In other words, if a user wants to listen to a video without interruption from the TalkBack feature, they can turn down the accessibility volume while leaving the video volume on. The new OS also comes with gestures for TalkBack, which takes advantage of fingerprint sensors on the back of devices. It allows TalkBack users to use gestures -- such as swiping up or down -- to launch specific TalkBack features. Clary and the Android Accessibility team stressed this week that developers should test accessibility features themselves and ask others with disabilities to try out their apps. They can also download the accessibility scanner from the Google Play store to find ways to improve accessibility on their app. "Try your app using these services, really put yourself in the shoes of these users," Clary said. "I think you'll be surprised with what you see."

By Stephanie Condon for Between the Lines | May 19, 2017 -- 19:22 GMT (12:22 PDT) | Topic: Innovation Artificial intelligence is "the driving force of the fourth industrial revolution," Google's Fei-Fei Li argued during a panel discussion on the final day of Google's I/O developer conference. AI, she added, "has the potential to tranform the way humans live, work, communicate." That said, technologists have only just begun realizing the impact of AI. As it matures, vision is going to be the "killer app of AI," said Li, the chief scientist of AI and machine learning for Google's cloud unit. Reiterating points she recently made to TechCrunch, Li noted that 540 million years ago, vision was likely the driving force behind the Cambrian Explosion -- a relatively short period of time over which a great diversity of life forms appeared. "When eyes were first developed in animals, suddenly animal life becomes proactive... evolution has changed," she explained. Hundreds of millions of years later, humans are the most intelligent visual animals, with half of the human brain dedicated to visual processing. Meanwhile, the sheer scale of visual data in our current world speaks to its importance: It's estimated that more than 80 percent of all of cyberspace is in pixel form, Li noted. Google Cloud Platform customers, she noted, are asking about capabilities like video processing and video analytics. Computer vision, she stressed is "one of the most important elements of machine intelligence and the transformation of enterprise and companies." While the last 10 years have brought significant progress in basic perception tasks, such as object recognition and image tagging, Li called the next big phase "vision plus X." In other words, the transformation of enterprise will come with combining the capabilities of computer vision with other fields of study. For instance, she noted that vision plays a "fundamental" role in communication, opening up opportunities to combine vision and language capabilities for functions like indexing videos. Vision also has huge potential in biological sciences and robotics, she said. At I/O, Google showcased its advances in computer vision, which are helping to drive its AI-first strategy. The company revealed how it's bringing computer vision capabilities to various products this year, starting with Google Assistant and Google Photos. Artificial intelligence has reached its current inflection point, Li argued, because of the convergence of three factors: the maturation of machine learning tools, Moore's Law and the improvement of hardware and the emergence of big data. While this is a "historical moment" for AI, "it's just the beginning," she said. "The tools and technologies we've developed are really the first few drops of water in the vast ocean of what AI can do." Daphne Koller, chief computing officer at Google-founded Calico Labs, noted that big data is not yet as ubiquitous as some may think. "We might like to think big data is, at this point, the solution to everything," she said on the panel with Li. While it plays a major role in some sectors, "in others we are unfortunately still in the medium or even small data regime." With that in mind, she said there's still a need for "balancing human intuition... with the data we're acquiring."

By Mark Sullivan3 minute Read Google was working on a natural language device similar to Amazon’s Echo back in 2013, more than a year before Amazon’s breakthrough device was released. advertisement During a meeting Wednesday at the Google I/O developer conference, two Google execs–VP of Google Assistant Scott Huffman and VP/GM of Home Products Rishi Chandra–told me that back in 2013 Google had already built prototypes of such a device. In one, some additional microphones were added to a tablet device, which was outfitted with natural language software. The device was designed to sit in a room and listen for a trigger word (“Hey Google”) from a user in the room, then deliver information via a speaker. Not that it worked very well. “I remember waking up one morning and hearing my kids screaming at it ‘Hey Google! Hey Google!’ and it wasn’t responding,” Huffman joked. Chandra told me Google even had a joke prototype of a voice assistant device, which was the shape of a large hockey puck, and when you lifted its lid off there was just a phone inside talking through its speaker. Rishi Chandra The story of the prototypes came after I asked the two men if Google had been influenced by the success of Amazon’s Echo to release its own smart speaker (Google Home in 2016). “Definitely,” said Chandra. “Amazon made a huge bet on ambient voice and it paid off,” he said. But Huffman and Chandra don’t credit Amazon for the idea of a smart natural language speaker. Google’s own smart speaker device–Google Home–was announced a year ago at Google’s developer event, and only went on sale six months ago. You can look at Google Home as the second major step in Google’s vision for search, and search-powered assistant features. Scott Huffman The first step came to life in 2013 when Google started making text search more contextual and conversational. Google began supporting nested searches where people could make a series of requests to zero in on the desired search result. The search engine, for the first time, would understand that all these queries were related to the same subject matter. It was the beginning of natural language search. advertisement With Home, Google allowed users to speak, not just type, requests in the back-and-forth fashion of natural language. In fact, as my colleague Harry McCracken wrote for Time back in 2013, Google’s vision for search is to make it something like the computer in Star Trek or 2001. That is, the computer is always listening, always there to assist. Here’s Google’s then SVP of search Amit Singhal talking to Harry back in 2013: “As a little child growing up in India, I watched way too much Star Trek. That’s the vision that stuck with me. You can talk to it naturally, you can ask it whatever you need to. It fades into the background. It’s just there for you,” Singhal said. It looks like that vision is still alive at Google today, as it continues to sink lots of research and development dollars into natural language and machine learning technology. And it points directly at what may be a third major step for natural language search at the company: The smart speaker device might disappear into the walls. It might be a series of tiny microphones distributed around the house, each reporting back (wirelessly) to the Google Assistant’s brain. Google, Samsung, and Microsoft have each followed Amazon with their own smart speaker products. Apple may join in the fun, too. For now however, Amazon leads the pack with Echo, and shows no signs of giving ground. A research report earlier this month said Amazon has sold an estimated 10.7 million Echos since the device began shipping in June 2015. An eMarketer report says Amazon controls 70% of the smart speaker market while Google has already grabbed a quarter of it in the six months since Home appeared on the shelves.

Here are the 10 best picks you don’t want to miss. Jennifer Dudley-Nicholson in Silicon ValleyNews Corp Australia Network May 20, 20174:57am The ten best technologies launched at Google. Picture: Jennifer Dudley. GOOGLE’S annual tech festival was not about one new product or one new service. Rather, the company behind most of the world’s internet searches launched a rapid-fire list of artificial intelligence developments, software refinements, and new ways your smartphone can make you look smarter at its annual Google I/O developers conference in Mountain View. We’ve rounded up 10 of the best things to watch for in the coming year, whether you’re keen on virtual reality, you want to identify new dogs in your neighbourhood, or you just want your phone to write email replies for you. 1. STAND-ALONE VR HEADSET Google is planning to issue an alternative to the tangled crown of cords that is virtual reality. While it doesn’t have a launch date, or even a name, the tech giant says it will partner with HTC and Lenovo to create a stand-alone virtual reality headset that uses its own screen and cameras that track your position for a more immersive experience. Google virtual reality vice-president Clay Bavor even promises that the display and its refresh rate will deliver images “akin to what you’d see in the PC-tethered headsets of today,” like the pricey Oculus Rift and HTC Vive. No word on what it might cost or when it will arrive. Watch this space. Google has a new camera app. Picture: Jennifer Dudley.Source:Supplied 2. GOOGLE HOME IS COMING TO AUSTRALIA The $US129 internet-connected speaker that launched in the US late last year is due in Australia this spring and it will bring localised services with it. Users can wake it by tapping its top or saying ‘OK Google’ from afar and asking it to deliver web search results, play podcasts or music, set timers, or find out about the weather. New features will offer information proactively, like flight delays or traffic warnings, will differentiate between different voices, and let you make purchases from online businesses that support it. There’s no word on when Australians might be able to place phone calls through the speaker, however, like its American users will be able to do this year. 3. GOOGLE LENS Of all Google’s plans for “deep learning” and “neural networks,” its new camera app might end up being the star. Google Lens is a new feature that uses those technologies to identify what the camera sees, from restaurants you pass on the street to dog breeds. If you point it at a flower, chief executive Sundar Pichai said, it will be able to identify what type it is. Google Lens could also capture information from a photo and use it automatically, entering the password to a friend’s wi-fi network, for example. Google didn’t set a date for its Lens launch, though the addition is likely to show up in Google Assistant and Photos apps first. Google's annual tech festival was not about one new product or one new service. Picture: Jennifer Dudley.Source:Supplied 4. EXPEDITIONS This is augmented reality for the classroom but not like it’s been seen before. Teachers can virtually map a room, and place virtual objects like statues, cyclones, robots or dinosaurs around it, which can be discovered and studied by pointing a phone camera at it. It’s compelling to see, and students can gather around one big object, or check out different objects around the room. There is a catch, though. The phone you use has to be Project Tango-enabled, like the upcoming ASKS ZenFone AR, with a depth sensor, and two cameras. 5. VISUAL POSITIONING SERVICE Described as a type of GPS for the great indoors, Google is using augmented reality technology to scan store shelves so it can point you to whatever you’re looking for within centimetres. American hardware chain Lowes is already trialling the technology in some stores, helping customers find those mystery wrenches, in an innovation Bavor claims could be useful for near-sighted shoppers. No word yet on whether you’ll be able to use it to find your car keys at home one day. Look out Siri, Google is coming from you. Picture: Jennifer Dudley.Source:Supplied 6. AUTOMATIC REPLIES Email can be a beast and Google’s latest way to tame it is small but potentially handy. The company has started rolling out a feature called Smart Reply that suggests responses beneath an email message. They can range from two-word answers, like “Thank you,” to follow-up questions such as “Did you get this?” They don’t appear beneath mailing list emails to prevent dreaded “reply all” fiascos. 7. ANDROID O It’s not super sexy but Google’s new Android operating system promises to deliver plenty of refinements to what its 2 billion users know. Improvements include a quicker start time, an indication that its scanning your apps for malware, a new way to see notifications (dots above each relevant app), and Smart Text Selection that will recognise phone numbers, addresses, and place names, and use the information accordingly, letting you place a phone call or open Maps, for example. It’s due late this year. Google CEO Sundar Pichai delivers the keynote address at the Google Conference at Shoreline Amphitheater on May 17, 2017 in Mountain View, California. Picture: AFP.Source:AFP 8. GOOGLE PHOTO BOOKS The latest Google Photo addition is strangely tangible for an internet company: photo albums. You’ll be able to order printed photo books from within this app and, being Google, it will come with an artificially intelligent twist. You can select a lot of photos and have Google choose the best for you, eliminating duplicates or fuzzy images. Of course, it’s still best to check over the final result before you pay your $US10. No word on when this will come to Australia. 9. IPHONE ASSISTANT Look out, Siri. Google is coming for you. The company will launch Google Assistant in Apple’s App Store to give iPhone users a chance to try out the competition. It will be free, able to give more comprehensive answers to voice-based web searches, and will also work with Google apps like Gmail, YouTube, and Maps. On the downside, you can’t launch it from the iPhone’s home button, it’s not the default voice assistant, and it will be less useful if you’re not using many Google services. Google CEO Sundar Pichai delivered the opening keynote address to kick off the three-day Google I/O 2017 Conference. Picture: AFP.Source:AFP 10. MORE PHONE VIRTUAL REALITY Google’s take on virtual reality will be coming to more phones this year, including LG’s upcoming flagship phone and the Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8+. All three will support the Daydream View headset, and use VR games from Google’s Play Store. It might seem a counterintuitive move, given Samsung has its own Gear VR headset and Google is developing a stand-alone VR device, but the $119 headpiece does make trying virtual reality cheap.

In fact, Google said at its developer conference this week that it has 7 products with over 1 billion users: Gmail, Chrome, Maps, Search, YouTube, Google Play Store and Android, which just hit 2 billion active devices. To put that in perspective, Facebook has 3 products with over 1 billion monthly users: Facebook itself, WhatsApp and Messenger. Even products that you may never have heard up draw millions to Google.

This version of the software introduces some radical chances to the mobile operating system, including picture-in-picture mode, notification dots, and Smart Text Selection. To take part in the Public Beta, users have only to tap a few buttons and let it go automatic! For those that want to run Android O the easy way – there are some restrictions. Only a few devices can run Android O at this early stage. These devices are in Google’s Nexus collection and Google’s Pixel collection – everyone else has a more difficult task ahead of them. The Nexus 5X is allowed to join the Android Beta program for Android O as of this week. The same is true of the Nexus 6P and the Nexus Player. As the Nexus Player is on the list, we expect that the NVIDIA SHIELD Android TV wont be far behind – but for now, NVIDIA SHIELD owners will have to wait just a bit. Google’s Android Beta program for Android O also includes the Pixel C as well as both the Pixel and the Pixel XL. These devices are all sold by Google with a unique version of Android on them – and all updates come through Google. The system of downloading the Android O Public Beta begins by signing up for the program. Tap in on the Google Android Beta page and read the directions. They’re simple, really – and they’ll begin with agreeing to some terms. Do not go forth if you have a device that needs to be active and work perfectly no matter what – that’s not what this program is all about. Once the Beta program has been accepted, head to your Android device’s settings. Inside settings, find Device Info and/or System Updates – and bang! There Android O will be. Eye think it’s the bomb!

As Google embarks on its ambitious plans to create a signature headquarters, the company's building spree is now stretching into Moffett Field. In recent weeks, the tech giant has started preparations to build a new 1.1 million square foot facility on the western side of Moffett Field, in what will be the company's largest construction project reported so far. But specifics on what the tech giant intends for the 42-acre site known as Bay View remain scarce. While Google and NASA officials confirmed the project's size and amenities, they initially declined to give much in the way of specifics on the design. Despite their reticence, detailed architecture drawings from last year of Google's plans for Bay View were posted to NASA's website. The plans show Bay View developed with three canopied dome-buildings that closely match the futuristic design Google is pursuing at its Charleston East site in Mountain View. On Wednesday, a Google spokesman confirmed to the Voice that the plans were for Bay View, but he said aspects of the design have been modified since they were submitted. Updated plans for the site would be available in the coming weeks, he said. Much like the company's plans for North Bayshore, Google officials have been developing a strategy for building out the Bay View site for quite a while. The company first inked a tentative deal with NASA for the mostly vacant, L-shaped parcel in 2005. Three years later, the national space agency awarded a long-term lease for the 42-acre site to Google's subsidiary, Planetary Ventures. The lease stipulates a 40-year lifespan that could be extended through 2098. Google agreed to pay about $3.65 million per year, which will be adjusted with inflation and occasional reappraisals of the property value. Speaking on Tuesday, NASA Ames Associate Center Director Deborah Feng hailed the future Bay View campus as an example of a well-executed partnership that would mutually benefit both NASA and Google. "Planetary Ventures has been a great partner for us," she said. "The great story here is that we've found a way to do an innovative public-private partnership for technology and research advancement." The Bay View lease was given to Google after the company emerged as the top applicant after the opportunity was posted publicly, Feng said. She could not immediately say whether there were any other applicants. Written into the 2008 lease is an agreement between Google and NASA to cooperate on projects on data management, distributed computing, developing the private space industry and "bio-info-nano convergence." As part of the deal, Google agreed to take on six infrastructure projects to improve the Ames campus, including widening R.T. Jones Road, the main access route to Bay View, building two fire-suppression water storage tanks, adding a cooling tower for the Ames Supercomputer facility and paying for a new recreational park for NASA employees. Originally, Google officials envisioned a nine-building office campus at Bay View that would be finished around 2015. But that plan ran into snags as the company approached the city of Mountain View with proposals to build up to three bridges across Stevens Creek to allow workers to more easily access Moffett Field. The plans sparked an outcry as environmentalists complained the bridge crossings could end up harming the wildlife habitat along the creek. In 2013, as city officials seemed poised to reject the bridge proposal, Google officials announced they were pulling back the entire Bay View project to retool its design. Since then, Google officials evidently incorporated elements of the eye-catching design they were pursing in North Bayshore into the Bay View project. Last month, as the Mountain View City Council discussed transportation management in North Bayshore, Google officials confirmed that they were launching construction of the Bay View project. During that discussion, City Council members expressed support for the allowing Google to build a bridge for transit and service vehicles across Stevens Creek either at Charleston Road or La Avenida Street. As many as 5,000 new employees are expected to occupy the new Bay View buildings, which should be complete by 2020, according to NASA officials. For now, the construction workers are grading the site with plans to begin construction in June. Google has been heavily involved in widening R.T. Jones Road from two lanes to four lanes and adding traffic signals to the intersection at Moffett Boulevard. Google officials said workers at the new campus would be heavily encouraged to take alternate forms of transportation. The Bay View plans from last year call for three office buildings of 53,900, 202,500 and 360,000 square feet in size. On the eastern side of the site, the company is proposing to build a parking lot and garage as well as a short-term corporate housing of an unspecified size. Comments There are no comments yet.

New, 6 comments by Adi Robertson@thedextriarchy May 19, 2017, 2:56pm EDT share tweet Linkedin Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge This week, Google announced a major expansion of its Daydream virtual reality platform. Daydream, currently only available on niche Android phones, is rolling out to the Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus this summer. That means that millions of smartphone owners will soon have two huge tech companies trying to sell them VR headsets. Google is offering the $79 Daydream View, which you’ll need to launch Daydream apps on your phone. Samsung sells the $129 Gear VR, which lets you access Oculus Home, a platform created by Facebook-owned VR company Oculus. Both headsets work the same way: after you clip a phone into the headset, you can interact with VR experiences using a small handheld remote. But they look and feel very different, and each has a completely separate app ecosystem. Unlike picking between two expensive desktop headsets like the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive, buying a mobile headset isn’t a huge investment — most of the cost is in the phone itself. Retailers and manufacturers also love offering VR headsets as sweeteners, so you may end up getting one (or maybe both) for free. But if you’re going to buy a Gear VR or Daydream View, which one is a better use of your money? We’re here to answer that question. The short answer Photo by Amelia Krales / The Verge You don’t want to order anything right now — it’ll likely be a couple of months at least until the update. But based on the current app ecosystem, you’ll find more to do on a Gear VR this summer, outweighing its higher price. It’s worth considering getting Daydream too, though, especially as its library expands. Keep an eye out for sales, and you may get both at a deep discount or completely free. And if you’re not wild about either one, you can hold off without feeling too much fear of missing out. For the rationale behind this verdict, read on. The case for Daydream The Daydream View is $50 cheaper, for one thing. It’s more compact and less intimidating than the Gear VR, and it’s quicker and easier to insert your phone and get started. You’ll get access to YouTube VR, which is one of the default locations for posting 360-degree video. (You can access YouTube videos through Samsung’s Gear VR web browser, but it’s a lot less convenient.) Daydream also connects you to a Google ecosystem that you’re probably already invested in. You don’t have to maintain a separate Oculus account, and Daydream lets you launch VR experiences directly from your home screen instead of going through another app. Daydream also makes it very easy to launch web-based VR experiences, and its VR version of Chrome will let you bookmark them on a desktop and come back to them later in VR. The case for Gear VR Photo by James Bareham / The Verge Games and apps. Daydream boasts of its fast-growing catalog, but it’s still small compared to the Gear VR’s offerings, and it’s unlikely to reach parity by this summer. While it doesn’t have YouTube, there is a Facebook 360-degree video app. And unsurprisingly for a Facebook-owned company, Oculus has a more robust social environment so far, with shared rooms and unusually cool avatars. The Gear VR hardware also has benefits. Its straps are less elegant but fit on your head more snugly, and it’s got a focus dial for different pupil distances, which can make the image clearer for some people. Its side trackpad also offers a failsafe if your controller runs out of battery, an issue I’ve had with the rechargeable Daydream remote. The Gear VR isn’t an intrinsically better product or platform, but for now, you’ll find more to do on it, unless you’re specifically invested in YouTube’s 360-degree video. When you’re in a price range between “impulse purchase” and “major investment,” it’s worth paying more for something that will likely get the most use in the short term.

Here are some of the games and experiences you should try on each. The case for neither Mobile VR headsets are primarily entertainment devices, not vital productivity tools. And the entertainment they offer is fun, but it’s less sophisticated than what you’ll find on more mature mediums, and there’s not nearly as much of it. One of the most popular kinds of content — 360-degree video — is available outside VR, too. Mobile VR headsets are also less comfortable than desktop ones, because you’re putting the weight of an entire phone on the front of your face. The controllers work impressively well considering the technical challenges involved, but they provide a limited range of motion. I’d encourage anyone who’s interested in VR and has a Galaxy S8 to get a mobile headset. But it won’t hurt to wait a year or two and see how things develop. Google just opened submissions for Daydream’s Google Play section a few months ago, so the app selection may look very different by then. Besides, in the next generation of VR, the best mobile headsets might not even need phones.

The development raises the possibility that Uber may end up dumping Anthony Levandowski, whose expertise in robot-controlled cars is the main reason that the ride-hailing company bought Levandowski’s startup for $680 million nine months ago. Until last month, Levandowski had been running Uber’s self-driving car division. Although he no longer is doing that, he remains a vital part of Uber’s effort to develop a fleet of robot cars so its service eventually will no longer have to rely on people to pick up passengers. Waymo, a self-driving car company started by Google, alleges Levandowski downloaded 14,000 documents containing its trade secrets before he founded the startup that he sold to Uber. Levandowski has asserted his rights under the Fifth Amendment since Waymo filed its lawsuit in February . But Uber is warning Levandowski that he may lose his job unless he waives those rights and reveals whether he took any Waymo documents. The San Francisco company made the threat in a May 15 letter that became public in a court filing late Thursday. Any admission by Levandowski that he possesses the Waymo documents could embroil him in even deeper legal trouble. That’s because Waymo’s allegations in the civil case have been referred to the U.S. Attorney’s office in San Francisco for a potential criminal investigation under an unusual order issued last week by U.S. District Judge William Alsup. Uber had been standing by Levandowski’s right use his Fifth Amendment protections until last week when Alsup issued another decision requiring the company to return any documents belonging to Waymo by May 31. Alsup wrote that “in complying with this order, Uber has no excuse under the Fifth Amendment to pull any punches as to Levandowski.” Uber alluded to Alsup’s stern language in its explaining its change of heart to Levandowski. “While we have respected your personal liberties, it is our view that the court’s order requires us to make these demands of you,” Uber’s general counsel, Salle Yoo, wrote in the letter. Levandowski is fighting back by trying to persuade Alsup to revise his order to protect his Fifth Amendment rights. In a filing, Levandowski’s attorneys argued that it’s unconstitutional for a judge to strong-arm an employer into pressuring a worker to give up his Fifth Amendment rights to remain on the job. “It is an act by the judicial branch of our federal government compelling an individual to choose between preserving his livelihood and preserving his constitutional rights,” Levandowski’s lawyers wrote. Waymo’s lawsuit already has handcuffed Levandowski. The case prompted Levandowski to temporarily step aside as Uber’s top self-driving car executive and avoid working on anything related to lidar, an array of sensors that enables autonomous vehicles to navigate the roads.

The official Nexus 5X Android O update won’t arrive until the third quarter but you can try it out ahead of time thanks to the Android O beta. Google’s released a public Android O beta for the Nexus 5X and the update brings new features, tweaks, and other improvements to the aging smartphone. There are plenty of reasons to consider installing the Android O beta on your Nexus 5X. New emojis, the potential for improved battery life and performance, a smart autofill feature, Picture-in-Picture mode, and improved notifications to name a few. There are also some good reasons to avoid the Nexus 5X Android O beta. Some of you might want to skip it for a few more days, others might be better off avoiding it entirely. We’ve been using the Android O beta on our Nexus 5X for a few days now and today we want to walk you through some reasons why you should, and shouldn’t, install the Android O update on your Nexus 5X today. Install It If You Want to Improve the Final Product   1 / 9 If you want to help Google improve the overall quality of the final Nexus 5X Android O update, you might think about trying to beta sometime between right now and the official release.  The Android O beta gives Nexus 5X users a chance to try out new features and test performance. It also gives users a chance to help Google fix bugs and polish performance.  On its Android Beta signup page Google, in bold no less, tells users signing up for the beta that their feedback "will help us identify and fix issues, and make the platform even better." If you've run into a problem with a previous version of Android, consider helping Google test the Nexus 5X Android O update ahead of its official release in late summer.  Your efforts could prevent a major problem from appearing in the final version of Android O.    1 / 9 Leave a Reply Cancel Reply Your email address will not be published.

Netflix was just the start: Google Play Console lets developers exclude app availability for devices that don't pass SafetyNet Rita El Khoury Follow View All Posts 2017/05/18 3:57am PDTMay 18, 2017 93 Plus 1 on G+ 108 Share on Facebook 82 Share on Twitter Total Shares283 Google News Last weekend, a huge turmoil swept the root-enthusiast Android community as it was discovered then confirmed that the Netflix app was being blocked from showing up in search results on the Play Store for rooted devices. At the time, Netflix said it was using Widevine to block unsupported devices, but that made no sense to us: the app was still functional if it was sideloaded, it was only not showing up as compatible in the Play Store. So what sorcery was Netflix really using?! Turns out it's a new function of the Google Play Console. As part of the updates announced for the Play Console at I/O 2017, Google mentions a new Device Catalog section under Release management that lets developers choose with intricate granularity which devices their app supports on the Play Store. Devices can be viewed and excluded by many attributes including RAM and SoC, but the important factor we're interested in is SafetyNet Attestation. New "Device catalog" lets devs manage the exclusions. Developers will be able to choose from 3 states shown in the top image: not excluding devices based on SafetyNet, excluding those that don't pass integrity, or excluding the latter plus those that aren't certified by Google. That means any dev could potentially block their apps from showing and being directly installable in the Play Store on devices that are rooted and/or running a custom ROM, as well as on emulators and uncertified devices (think Meizu and its not-so-legal way of getting Play Services and the Play Store on its phones). This is exactly what many of you were afraid would happen after the Play Store app started surfacing a Device certification status. This is different from the full SafetyNet API implementation that apps like Android Pay and Pokémon Go use. In the case of Pay/Go, the attestation check happens when the app is installed on your phone and doesn't allow it to run unless it passes the integrity test. But in the case of the Play Console, the attestation check happens when you're browsing the Play Store and only affects the availability of the app for your device. If the full SafetyNet API isn't included in the app itself, you will still be able to grab the APK from other sources, install it, and the app will work just fine. Still, this spells trouble for rooted users and the Android enthusiast community as a whole. Google keeps erecting more and more obstacles each day in the face of root and custom ROMs and even if this won't stop root users who should be knowledgable enough to know how/where to grab an APK and install it, it will make things more and more difficult and maybe less and less worth the trouble. But y'all are rebels and you'll keep on finding a way around it, won't you?

Nice move Google. Suicide_Note Not sure if serious, but either way, this was just a matter of time. YouNex Obviously not serious EowynCarter So, question : Is there anyway to get android O in the future on my nexus 6 and not having problems with this ? IF manufacturer where taking care of updating their devices, wouldn't be an issue... saf1927 If Magisk keeps working, yep. You can. Even my old Nexus 5 is on 7.1.2 and it passes SafetyNet. EowynCarter I want "just work" stuff. Not workaround. Maybe Magisk does the job for some, but not an acceptable solution from my point of view. Mainly the "we don't know if it will keep on working" part. saf1927 Well, it's the best solution so far and it has improved a lot since its inception. I never bothered since the Nexus 5 was a secondary device for me, but now that some apps won't show up anymore on the Play Store, I simply flashed Magisk and that's about it. I haven't tweaked anything. Plus, if you are already flashing a custom ROM, flashing an extra zip file isn't that much work anyway. EowynCarter True, but it's the phone I use dailly. I don't want apps sudendly not working, becasue google decided to push an update that broke magisk. mxwp well if you want things to "just work" then i guess get an iPhone EowynCarter Sadly, I'm beginning to think about that. But that would cause others frustrations. ED-Zが現れた! Well, people will just flock to root-supported apps... Milton P. I actually forgot when was the last time I Rooted a device. No biggie. Suicide_Note The bad thing is it isn't just root that causes problems. Simply unlocking the bootloader will produce the same result. Maxr1998 Just because it's no biggie for you, it doesn't mean everyone approves this. I am actually pretty concerned, because this limits the freedom over our devices even more.. Milton P. Define freedom, please. Maxr1998 Software freedom, to be more specific. You should have the freedom to use and modify your device and it's software however you'd like, and have fill control over it. That means, root access. And since the AOSP core IS free software, the 4 freedoms defined by Richard Stallman apply to it. What this change now introduces is that you're forced to decide between either giving up the freedom over your device or not using the app you wanted to download (which will probably have to be my choice, and that sucks). Milton P. But you're not giving up anything, you just have to make a choice. If you put that way, Google has the freedom of doing with the AOSP core whatever they want, the same way you can modify said core and do as you please, the difference is Google has more money and more responsibilities when it comes to their user base. XDA and other sites will still have a bunch of developers making whatever they please (within the AOSP terms) with the AOSP core. This will just change thinks for the people that use those ROMs bit realistically the vast majority of users won't feel the changes. Sad but true. h4rr4r That choice is giving up freedom you had before. The vast majority will see the rate of Android improvements slow as the Devs on XDA and the like lose interest. Android only exists because of Linux, now it is turning its back on that whole culture. Milton P. Well, I don't see your freedom compromised to be honest with you, but we're seeing things from different angles so that's that. Sorry for your loss in that case. h4rr4r You do not think losing control of your device is a loss of freedom? Milton P. Nope, is just a device, I have more important stuff going on, m device is a tool the same way a hammer is a tool, you can buy a hammer and use it as it is. Sometimes my device is a toy, if I buy a remote control car I'll modify it as long as it is possible, the same way I modify my phone. I have control over my phone. I can install whatever I want at my own risk. If I decide to root my phone I expect things to be broken. I remember when I had an HTC and I hated sense so I decided to install a custom ROM, I gave up the camera and I was aware of it. There was always some compromises with custom ROMs, nothing is changing. I rather have a safe device then a compromised one today, still my choice thou. h4rr4r So you want IOS. Got it. Over here I want freedom. I don't think homedepot should be allowed to tell me what I can hit with the hammer I bought. trparky Open platforms rarely stay open once they become popular. Once the Benjamins come rolling in it tends to override open. h4rr4r Tell that to Linus Torvalds. I am sure he will have many many fuck yous for you. trparky Linux is the rare situation. h4rr4r The rare situation like many others that created android and even google. trparky Yeah but look at Android, the walls are closing around it and there's nothing you can do about it. Face it man, the geeks may have built the system but the common man now rules it. Geeks love choice, yes, they do love their choice but your average person doesn't give a rat's ass about choice. All they want is a device that does what they need it to do when they want to do it. They have no inclination to learn how it works or why it works just as long as it does. This is what geeks do not and refuse to understand. h4rr4r Sure there is, stop using it. Then the common folks will have to follow us to the next platform. trparky As long as their is money involved in maintaining Android it doesn't matter if something better comes along, people will continue supporting Android because it makes them money. Money makes the world go round, get used to it. Maxr1998 ^ What @h4rr4r:disqus says. trparky Yep. The root and ROM community is such a small portion of the Android ecosystem that they really don't matter to them. People have been screaming at Google for years to get the Android house fixed up, this is them doing just that. You can't blame them for doing what the people have asked for. mxwp I agree with you, but sadly you only have freedom over hardware. You can do what you want with the device you buy. But with software you never actually buy it... you only buy a license to use it. Thus you have no real freedom with software. Maxr1998 Android is free software, Apache 2.0 license. At least the AOSP part of it. trparky But the Google parts of it are not covered under the Apache 2.0 license. That's essentially why ROM developers can't package the Google Play Services pack with the ROM itself and instead requires you to download a separate ZIP package from Google to install it separate from the ROM package. Android itself may be free and open but the Google Play Services part is not. Sudev There are far more than few arguments against root access but here are some: Root access is meant for experimental & development purpose and not for Daily Driver for any average user of the platform. Google Play Services & Apps available on Play Store are not "Free Software". Google as provider of Play Services infrastructure has much more liabilities then one can simply assume. And also the app developers have responsibility to protect end users' data. If device has root access available and any rouge app / maleware steals other apps data which is possible, who will be at stack? h4rr4r The ability to do anything I want with my things that I own. Milton P. You​ can do whatever you want with your device, nobody is stopping you. You might see that some apps are not showing up in the play store but you can still side load them, I still see freedom in your future. h4rr4r For how much longer? Soon these apps will ask play services if they are supposed to be installed on that device, at that point you can say goodbye to sideloading. If this is what people want then IOS was the platform for them. thecoolkid Ok Google, define freedom... 😁 Nick I would imagine a great deal of people on this site will be upset, but in actuality I don't think this will affect the user base of many apps that badly h4rr4r Not in the short term. However in the long term it will. Android only exists because of the FREE software movement. Nick Yes, but that doesn't apply to applications, which this is about. h4rr4r Think long term. Same thing applies. trparky No it won't because the root and ROM community is so small it doesn't matter to Google anymore. The 95% of people who simply want a device that works don't care and likely won't ever care. As long as they can play NetFlix, Pokemon Go, or whatever is the next craze they don't care. h4rr4r Again, that is short term thinking. Think past the end of your nose. Android exists because of linux. Google needs this small group to create the very stuff they rely on. trparky You overestimate the value that the community has now. Android may have needed the community back in the beginning to gain the foothold that it has in the market but not so anymore. Android has near 100% market penetration, they have achieved world domination. They don't need the community anymore, they have achieved their goals. h4rr4r Until they are unseated. IBM once had a monopoly on computing devices. They did not need the community to gain a foothold, they would not have a product to gain a foothold without the community. Android only exists because of a collection of those projects. trparky No, Android exists because Samsung, HTC, and LG make devices people want and it makes them money by the semi-truck full. The community doesn't mean shit now, all that matters to these companies is one thing... money, money, and more money. Oh, and did I mention money? This is capitalism man, money rules the world. If you don't make money you are dead. h4rr4r Please tell me how that would have happened without linux. Money loses to good engineering every day. Look at how linux killed solaris. trparky Tell me why Windows is the defacto monopoly on the desktop despite the fact that Linux is better in every damn way possible under the hood? That's right... money. h4rr4r Because the desktop is dead. The fight is over. They lost. Even money can't keep them relevant. trparky Oh, you're funny. The desktop is not dead, it will never be dead. When people need to do real work, they sit down at a desktop. When people want to play real games, they sit down at a desktop. When people need to type out anything longer than a page like a college term paper, they sit down at a desktop. The desktop is king and will always be king. Long live the desktop! h4rr4r The Desktop is a dead man walking. When they do real work, they use a Citrix session. When they game they use a console, or they are already nerds. When people type they can use a fucking chromebook. The desktop as you think of it died already. trparky Try and say that shit over at TechPowerUp, HardOCP, Overclock.net, TomsHardware, etc. and trust me when I say this... you'll be run out of town by people with pitchforks and torches. h4rr4r Those are all nerds. Those are the folks who have desktops running 3 different OSes. They are the folks who are pissed about android being locked down. trparky And your point being? You just admitted that only the "nerds" care about Android being open. Sure, those same "nerds" will go off and create a new platform but the rest of the people who are living in the real world and who don't care one damn bit about how it works will continue to use Android. h4rr4r Those people will eventually move to the new platform. Just like they did with Android. trparky And the same thing will happen to that platform in the future that's happening to Android now. Open platforms are nice and all, I'll admit that, but your average person doesn't care one bit. I dare you to go up to any person on the street and ask them anything about Android. What phone do they have? What model? Most will say "I don't know, something that my carrier gave me for cheap." h4rr4r The wheel of computing we call it. It has happened and will happen again. So what? trparky Which reinforces the idea that I said before, eventually all open systems will become closed (or less open) at some point in their life cycle. It usually happens when it becomes popular with the common man. Why? Because like I've been trying to get through your thick skull, the average person doesn't care how any of this stuff works so long as it works. h4rr4r The average person does not matter. Few open systems become closed. AOSP is still fine. trparky What the hell do you mean by "they don't matter"? They're the ones buying the devices, buying the apps, looking at the ads, etc. Just how the fuck does that translate to "they don't matter"? h4rr4r Because they don't. They don't create, they don't cause new things to be created. They are just users, just like I don't matter to how movies are created. trparky But without money from the people who are consuming said things developers won't make new stuff. Developers do have to eat you know and put a roof over their heads. h4rr4r The giant world of FOSS pretty much proves you wrong. Demand cannot create supply. I don't pirate anything kiddo. I have way too much to lose for that. One of those lawsuits I would actually have to pay, since I could. trparky I'll give a hint on how FOSS works a lot of the time. Some of the top tier Linux kernel developers actually work for companies and they just contribute code in their free time. They may work for Intel, AMD, nVidia, or God knows what but only after their day job is done. Why? Because they need money and they need to eat. This is a basic requirement for people in this world. They need money!!! People don't just write code for the love of it, even Linus Torvalds who's in charge of the Linux kernel itself works for the Linux Foundation and yes, he gets paid for his work to the tune of $10 Million a year. Sorry to burst your bubble man but FOSS projects aren't all happy, happy, joy, joy here... people need to be paid real money to be able to eat, drive a car, put a roof over their heads, etc. On second thought, I'm not sorry I burst your bubble! You need it burst! PEOPLE NEED TO BE PAID REAL FUCKING MONEY!!!! h4rr4r No, they get paid to contribute. During the work day. Not as a hobby. Lots of projects are like that. I won't say exactly how I know about that ;) Their employers just aren't as short sighted as you. Linus did not however create linux to get rich. Great code like great art gets created because it must be. People do what they love. Kid, you will get it one day. When you have enough that you aren't worried about it each day, money stops being that big of a deal. Don't worry everybody goes through a phase like you are now. trparky Dude, we are not the Federation of Planets here living in a happy, happy, joy, joy world in which people can just do whatever they want to do without a care in the world. As long as human greed exists there will always be a need for money. And believe you me, greed will never go away unless we breed a new kind of human and I don't see that happening any time soon. Gene Roddenberry's future will never happen, it just won't. Contrary to a lot of geek dreams it just won't. h4rr4r No idea where you got that idea. Never suggested it. My point was the personal relative value of increasing income drops as income goes up. If you make minimum wage doubling your income is a huge deal. Adding the same amount to my income would not get me to take a job I like less. Offering it to Linus would be a waste of time. Yes, some people will keep chasing dollars, they are the exception not the rule. The employers are working on enlightened self interest. Either they use the FOSS product, gain market advantage with direct knowledge, use it for marketing or believe they are getting something else. PostgreSQL for example has a lot of paid contributors who work for companies that either provide customization, consulting or depend on the project. Others just because it increases quality. Commercial software by and large is not high quality. I have seen a lot of it and 90% if you tried to submit it to a FOSS project of any size would get you denied and possibly mocked. This system continues to be more innovative because it is easy to continue to expand. Anyone with a good idea can fork if their idea is not accepted. trparky > My point was the personal relative value of increasing income drops as income goes up. Tell that to the people in Washington or any CEO that demands ever increasing yearly salaries and end of year bonuses all while raping the companies that they work for. Tell that to the psychopaths on Wall Street. For as long as their is money, people will want more of it. Anyone who says that they don't is flat out lying. h4rr4r Those are the exception not the rule. That is why you call them psychopaths. Honestly, correcting for inflation I really don't care that much if I ever make more. Would it be nice sure, would I give up anything I like about my job? No. If you could double my income but it prevented me from contributing to FOSS projects or owning code I generate off the clock, I would not take that deal. If money was enough to make people do anything MS would have offered Linus $11 million a year to not write it. Heck, Sun would have done it while they were still around. trparky Either you're a child that doesn't know how the adult world works or you're a fucking troll. h4rr4r So you have no idea who makes stuff, neat. I guess you think Henry Ford should have made a faster horse. trparky Oh, I know who makes the stuff I use but I also make sure that they are paid! I give money to those developers who write the programs that I enjoy and if I can't pay them I won't use their programs. I only use a program if I can pay for it. I have put money into their tip jars on their web site, I look for PayPal links and I donate even if it's something small like $5. They deserve it! h4rr4r Good for you! There is a lot of great software that does not make money that way. Some even just ask is that you follow the license, like linux which mediatek steals by not releasing kernel source. So I hope you avoid buying that kind of thing. trparky MediaTek controller chips are known to suck so I don't buy them out of that reason alone. h4rr4r Now I have given you another good reason to avoid them. Bunch of thieves. Rita El Khoury I don't even remember when I last bootloader unlocked. But I know this move toward closing the ecosystem further and further will have ripples in the future. The enthusiast community flocked toward Android for its openness and we have custom ROMs and their enterprising devs to thank for HUNDREDS of new features that they implemented first and everyone clamored for and applauded until they became features in AOSP. If Google thinks it can steer this ship alone and it knows best what to do next, we may have less and less interesting features in the future and more and more of what only one entity thinks is best, not a diverse set of opinions. Nick Given that this only gives the developer the option of requiring these checks, it makes me believe that Google had to do this for some companies that have regulatory or other kinds of requirements. Which is a shame for the rooted (and unlocked?) community, but understandable. Shame Google is most likely going to take the blame here in this comment section though. Rita El Khoury Well, maybe they had to, but that won't stop any developer from implementing it without any regulatory or legal requirement pushing them to do so. Nick Right, which puts this choice on the developer, not Google. Google was stuck behind a rock and hard place, perhaps. EowynCarter Well, google is certainly to blame for not planing to update my nexus 6 to android O. And now I can't even use custom rom as plan B without losing some apps :( Suicide_Note Boo hoo. Buy a new phone and quit crying that Google doesn't support phones forever. EowynCarter Fine can you order a pixel XL and ship it to me in France ? Plus, my nexus 6 still works, I hate having to replace working stuff. Makes no sense, economically and ecologically speaking. Suicide_Note I'll sell you my XL when I'm done with it, but only after i get the Pixel XL 2. :) EowynCarter Well, I do hope Google sells the "pixel 2 "( or whatever its name) here. For now, I'm'just hoping my nexus 6 don't break. Else I might jump on the iOS ship. I'm not convinced the the other android alternatives. Note 8 would be the closest, but touchwiiz, delayed updates.... I'm spoiled after a few years with a nexus. Suicide_Note There always eBay or Swappa if you want to get a first gen Pixel. I was looking at prices over the weekend, and mint condition Pixels are going for about $450. EowynCarter Not so much in France. And eBay for suff that cost more that a few bucks, too risky. Plus, the pixel is getting "old" by now. Wilton Daniel Pinto Troll found trparky Yet Microsoft still supports Windows 7 EIGHT YEARS LATER! How come Microsoft can do that yet Google can't? Alex Louderback Actually, that's Qualcomm EowynCarter Source for this ? trparky And Qualcomm can go fuck themselves. Gee... I wonder why they're being hit with an anti-trust lawsuit. Could this be one of many reasons why? trparky Yes, Google is to blame for that. There's no damn reason why your Nexus 6 can't run Android O other than the fact that they just don't want to. Bojan Bunić My bootloader was unlocked prior to changing the mobo on my 5X, courtesy of Booty Loops. Root, well, probably before I got my Nexus 4. Although I'll see how it'll go on in the future, as we don't have Pixels here, so the only near stock possibility is either OnePlus, or some other device and a custom ROM. Milton P. Agree 100% with you, I mean I remember the old days when I hated HTC's Sense, I literally decided that a phone without a camera was better than whatever HTC did back then, but Android has evolved quite a lot nowadays, don't get me wrong, I do believe that custom ROMs did a great job showing Google what the users want but that won't change, as long as someone shows Google what people want Google will keep improving Android, because there's no limits. Now if they go the Apple way and lock EVERYTHING then we'll be fucked, I'm the meantime developers will find a way around the system pushing Google along. Premsuraj An open bootloader and root actually solves a lot of problems still existing in AOSP. The Nougat update absolutely destoryed the battery life of many Nexus 6P devices, with Google only focussing on the Pixels, there was no fix in it. I unlocked, used Franco Kernel + naptime + Greenify and I now I get adequate battery life. Another feature I can think of is theming. Material design is good, but the whiteness is rage inducing Maxr1998 Well, fuck them. Let's just hope not many devs will use this, and Google won't enable this by default anytime soon. Maxr1998 The more I think about this, the more concerned I get. This will reduce the freedom over our devices, and also limit developers in the awesome things they could do before because of Android's openness. I am all in for device security and fighting against malware, trojans and phishing applications, don't understand me wrong, but that doesn't mean that you have to take people away their freedom - just look at how Linux (GNU and Linux) is doing it. Tom Westrick How does this limit developers? If anything it gives them more control. Maxr1998 Fair point, I should have been more specific. With "developers", I meant rom developers and modders, app developers only if they require root access for their apps. "Normal" developers can use this to enforce a "secure" (read: DRM locked-down) environment, but that's not really a good thing in my opinion.. (Refer to my other comments.) trparky You're angry at the wrong people, you should be angry at Hollywood; they're the ones that are demanding this kind of stuff. Their content, their rules; it's how things are in the real world. They have to do what they need to do to protect their investments, plain and simple. We don't necessarily have to like it, hell... we may even hate it, but that's how it is. You want the content? Play by their rules. Colin Richardson If you are an app developer and want your app to run on custom roms..... don't turn on "Requires SafetyNet"... bekifft We are increasingly living in the future Richard Stallman warned us about. With Google taking all these steps, may as well go back to using jailbroken iPhones. Bart Janusz I've already enabled it and I know at least 3 others devs that did it as well. I really don't care about root per se, but custom roms and xposed is source of countless problem as both are buggy as hell. Maxr1998 But in which way does that influence you? Xposed can introduce bugs to the system, sure, but it won't affect the performance of your app unless it itself is modded, so you probably don't have to fear bad reviews for bad performance anyway. And custom roms? LineageOS on my mother's Moto G runs like a champ and much better than the 5.1 stock rom before. And in my experience as a dev, there were much more incompatibilities with Samsung TouchWiz than with AOSP-based custom roms. refthemc I'm sure he's just trying to avoid the headache of emails he gets daily from users who have no idea that it's their fault the app is not working or crashing... Bart Janusz Indeed, not to mention extra crash and ANRs reports which seems to influence app positioning. Maxr1998 But why? The device may behave more buggy at some parts because of Xposed (and mine definitely ran like shit on MM because of some mods, but I NEVER blamed any apps), but the apps itself won't run worse if not modded - normally they should even run better if you only use performance mods like Greenify, NLP Collector wakelock disabler and other light mods. I don't think he gets many reports anyway, considering what @marcusmarcus2:disqus said. Bart Janusz You may not, but many users do, and as I said there are a lot of bogus ANRs and crash reports. Since my app depends heavily on low level OS elements both custom ROMs and xposed are deal breakers (and you really should check source, since I do not update my website as I moved to G+/FB but app has sizable user base given its niche and I'd to deal with ROM/xposed issues fequently). Maxr1998 Well, but the same type of users also give bad reviews etc. without using any mod or root. You generalize modders to only cause problems, and therefore lock out everyone. About your app/website thing: fair point, I didn't look at it yet, and have to apologize for being a little rude. marcusmarcus2 You need to take your own advice, "you really should check source". If you moved to G+/FB, then why does your app on the play store still point to the same website as well. Or at least put a link on the old website that directs to G+/FB. There is nothing that points to your so called G+/FB source. So @Maxr1998:disqus has no other source to check at the moment. Bart Janusz Not that I care but if you try to draw conclusion about app you should probably visit Play Store listing. Anyhow that's really not important I just chimed in to explain why developer will use this. I've choose to do so due to extra burden which in effect hurts majority of my user base, one of my colleagues cited lucky patcher and freedom (which I think is not such a good idea but its his choice). trparky You may not blame the apps because you know better but most people don't understand that, most people see a crashing app and suddenly you see, as the developer, a ton of comments saying that your app sucks. h4rr4r Please do tell us about your apps so we can be sure to avoid them on any devices we have not yet rooted. marcusmarcus2 His disqus profile leads to this website http://artflowstudio.com/ which has a few apps listed. Art oriented apps. There is only 1 update on that website since 2014, so I don't think I would be to concerned about installing one of his apps. Jordan Palmer Nice detective work. Adrian I can see a lot of refund requests coming from people who paid for apps and suddenly are told "Nope. Not for you anymore." A lot of us are rooted and buy apps and you'd better believe noise will be made if an app I use daily, that I paid for, suddenly breaks with an update because it's no longer blessed by the dev to run on my device. It's your app and you can do what you want with it, but there is always another side to the coin. BAlGaInTl That's not the way that Netflix worked it, and I doubt other developers of paid apps would either. I have a OnePlus One, that I run Lineage OS on since the original Cyanogen OS is now defunct and does not receive any updates. Netflix simply doesn't update to v 5+. It still works just fine. I may not get the newest and latest features, but part of that is on me for using a device that is dated. I'm not one of those users who, because I paid for an app once, fells that I should get all of the updates from now until the end of time. That isn't sustainable for developers. It could very well be that Netflix has some new features/offerings in the works in which they are getting pressure from outside sources to push this. A lot of valid reasons for a developer to enable the check exist. As long as they do it in the same manner that Netflix has, I don't see the issue. Adrian And just like Pokemon Go, eventually you'll get a message that you need to upgrade to the latest version or the app won't work, you know, that new version that won't let you actually log into it anymore. We've already seen this happen so let's not pretend that it isn't the next logical step. They aren't going to keep letting people sign in indefinitely with an app that doesn't have the security level they want. It's naive to think that hey I can just stick with the last version that works for root. It takes all of what, the time it takes to create a switch that says minimum version required to log in is "DRM version" BAlGaInTl Good Point. I recognize that. But it seems that the blame (in general) is being directed at Google in many of these posts. If that scenario happens, it isn't Google that blocked you from accessing Netflix. The need for this level of security is on the increase. The same users demanding better security and longer updates are the first ones to cry foul when Google starts laying the groundwork for exactly what they have asked for. Adrian I think there is a way to do both that doesn't piss off a very active community that helped take Android from a very very very ugly, second class OS to what we have now. I know a lot of us remember just how crippled Android was and it was the root/mod community that produced the bulk of what is now standard on Android. There needs to be a way to secure the devices AND not turn their back on the developer community that contributes. The idea, in Netflix's case, that root = pirate is insane. Why in the world would someone prefer to rip content on their phone to say a computer or XBox that is never going to move and can do it while you get on with your life? They're doing something for the sake of saying they're doing something, but if they think it's going to make a dent in piracy they, and the studios are nuts. I watch a lot of Netflix and still prefer to buy discs. People who do things the right way and are perfectly happy paying for content shouldn't have to jump through hoops to watch it. Those of us who root usually have a handful of things that stock Android is not doing for us. It's why we root. If all of these things were available in stock, my reasons for rooting would disappear but I don't see that happening any time soon. I think Android is getting so much better but if they make it exactly like iOS, might as well go to the dark side because Apple's apps tend to be more polished, come out first and OS updates are frequent. Don't bite the hand that feeds you just because you're getting more popular. BAlGaInTl I think that Netflix is a good example. It is HIGHLY likely that the reason for recent unpopular changes (see also VPN blocking) are being driven by other entities. It isn't that Netflix thinks its a problem, but the people that control a large portion of their content do. root pirate but it does introduce a security risk. I don't see how Google is turning their backs on developers. Developers are free to develop as they see fit and choose (at least for the moment) whether or not they will implement the SafetyNet check. The inherent problem is that a circumvented security is still circumvented and can no longer be considered secure. I can clearly see why some apps would and should frown upon that. Maybe not Netflix and Mario (IMHO), but certainly something like bank and payment apps. I don't think the inherent open nature of android will ever reduce to the level of iOS. But some changes have to occur to meet the needs/desire of the majority. Security is inherently difficult. The easier and more flexible you try to make it, the less secure it becomes. Adrian I do think banking apps should run in a secure space. Completely agree with that, but I disagree with root = less secure. My nexus devices stopped getting OS and security updates. Nothing. VERY insecure and dangerous. I rooted them, updated the OS with images from XDA developers and my devices that were once easy targets are more secure. There is always two sides to it. I see that Google is finally trying to take security seriously on Android and doing things in layers that completely cut out the vendor AND the carriers is the right step. Right now, Root is the only way to update a perfectly good device like my Nexus tablet tablet that the vendor said "oh well" to. Until Google has a REAL strategy in place to keep ALL Android devices secure, root will be necessary. Not everyone wants to or can upgrade devices every two years because they get abandoned. My father doesn't need an S8. He does need a device that gets security updates for more than a year after purchasing his phone. BAlGaInTl You are exactly correct, and I'm in the same situation with my OnePlus One. But in working to increase your security level, you leave holes behind. The key words that you used are "more secure." I agree. You are "more secure." But still (probably) less secure than a device that has been thoroughly tested, certified, and passes SafetyNet without hacks. Google has been open that they are working on security updates. They have improved significantly over the last couple years in getting those out. I feel that they are putting in place a real strategy to keep Android devices secure. This is part of that groundwork. I also feel that they are actively looking to replace Android in it's current state, and I can't say I blame them. The only real strategy may be to take lessons learned and start over. Lucky for them, they have the resources to do so. trparky > take lessons learned and start over Pretty much. The worst thing that they did from the very beginning was to allow for the OEMs to do what they wished. Google essentially made a deal with the devil when they released Android to the world. They wrote no requirements into the Android agreements that the OEMs agreed to to require updates to be a necessary thing. Big mistake Google. BAlGaInTl The really needed to in order to get their foot in the door of the market. If it would not have been open source from the beginning, none of the major manufactures would have bought off on it. The fact that they could use it for free (essentially) and still be able to customize on top of it is what sold it. trparky And now look at it, Android is a fucking mess of non-updated insecure devices that are ripe for anyone to be able to take over and turn into a botnet. trparky And you should be raising holy hell with the OEM that made that device! Just because your device is old doesn't mean that it shouldn't still be supported. Windows 7 is nearly eight years old and it still receives Windows Updates. Why can't your device? BAlGaInTl Normally, I would agree, but the OnePlus One is a special case. The OEM operating system is the now defunct Cyanogen OS. I had to balance having the original OS without updates, or running another with updates. The phone is now almost three years old. If I bought a PC with Windows on it three years ago, and Microsoft had since gone out of business, should the PC manufacturer be responsible for providing Windows 7 updates? Even though the PC is beyond it's support date? Sure, I can increase the security by switching to another OS that is updated. It may even be a Windows clone. But if a software developer decided to only support "original, unmodified" PC configurations, that would be within their right. trparky But it can be adapted to run LineageOS. Sudev There is bit difference in analogy here: OnePlus manufactured the phone and Cynogen Inc customized AOSP Android OS for it, they didn't developed it from ground up. I understand that Cynogen INC is out of business now too. However in PC world, it would be the case that you purchased a PC from Dell and get Microsoft Windows OS with some additional Dell software. If Dell or developer of that custom software goes out of business you still get OS update for your PC. Its not android OS itself out business here. Adrian and for the record, I absolutely agree that it was the content providers and not all on Netflix. trparky You should be demanding that OnePlus send an official update to your device. So what if your device is old? It should be still supported. Windows 7 is still supported nearly eight years later, why can't your device be supported for that long as well? Plumplam Who cares except for a bunch of XDA nerds? If it means better security then I'm all for it. Dmitri Smirnov Well, for starters, it doesn't mean better security, since it does nothing to address the problems with vulnerable outdated android versions that will be "certified", but will allow malicious apps to quietly escalate their privileges and do their dirty work, but will block "uncertified" custom roms that actually have all the recent secuirity patches and give user full control over who has root access and how. Also, "bunch of XDA nerds" are the source of a lot of features that had their trial run in custom ROMs and then were adopted to the AOSP. Should I remind you of "The Oak and the Pig" fable? Alienate the developers bringing new ideas to the ecosystem - lose the competetive edge you had over other OSes saf1927 Actually, custom ROMs never really have the latest security patches despite what they claim since kernels aren't maintained and no proprietary blobs is updated anymore. If ROM developers were OEMs, they'd be violating their agreements with Google by bumping the patch level without actually addressing all the vulnerabilities. Dmitri Smirnov Well they patch the AOSP to the same level as latest official one and kernel - if it's possible to do so without breaking the compatibility with compiled blobs or at least on the level of latest official firmware. So in the end run it's at least as secure as the official firmware, often - much more so. saf1927 If you look at the security bulletin, most vulnerabilities come from proprietary drivers and require these to be updated. On a supported device, these are provided by the chip manufacturers to the OEMs, on an unsupported device they aren't updated anymore. A custom ROM can only fix userspace security issues. In the end, bumping the patch level without addressing all vulnerabilities in that patch gives a false sense of security to users. Dmitri Smirnov If anything, this is an argument for forcing OEMs to opensource their blobs. For some reason community is much better at releasing the fixes for what they can change (userspace), while OEMs generally stop caring as soon as device is out the door. saf1927 The problem goes beyond OEMs unfortunately. All the phones you can buy are assembled with off-the-shelf components that they buy from other manufacturers and it is them that provide the binary blobs to the OEMs. If they stop supporting components, the OEMs can't do anything. For the chip, it's companies like Qualcomm, Samsung, Mediatek etc. that need to support it with up-to-date drivers. Once they stop, the life-cycle of a phone comes to an end. trparky And that is probably one of many reason why Qualcomm is facing a nice fat anti-trust lawsuit. Serves them right. trparky That ain't ever going to happen. There's no way they're going to allow for their intellectual property to be open for all the world to see and have it cracked open. It would be corporate suicide since their competitors would be able to reverse engineer their stuff. Suicide_Note Never heard of "The Oak and the Pig" before. Could you tell me more? Seriously. Dmitri Smirnov http://www.aliceswonderland.eu/Alice-ska350-en.html Maxr1998 Ah, Lessing. Going to read the original version in a minute :) username_not_valid Thats a very generous view of the custom ROM community. It might be true of a few, very few devs, but most ROMs are unsupported garbage with serious security issues. Dmitri Smirnov Maybe so, but out of this cesspool of garbage CyanogenMod was born, which became LineageOS. I'd say their quality standard appeals me more than a lot of OEMs. username_not_valid Cyanogen and Lineage was what i had in mind.. Each to his own i guess. BAlGaInTl Yes and no. I run Lineage on my OnePlus One because Cyanogen OS is no longer supported. I can say with certainty that Lineage introduces stability issues that I have to deal with to be up to date. Wilton Daniel Pinto Ninna pooty bewarci Qwip Consider the bigger picture. Right now, users are being shuffled into a situation where they must restrict the control they have over their device if they want to be able to use Netflix (and presumably banking apps will follow soon). That may seem fine, and from some security perspective it is probably a good thing. How much control do you have over your _laptop_? How much do you want? Right now, we're blissfully able to install unsigned software on our computers (although various OSs will complain about it), but will that last? How long will it be before we can only open our banking interface on our laptop using a trusted, digitally signed browser on a machine that is using secure boot and can only run signed binaries? I can understand the direction that Netflix (and others) are coming from, and to them it may even make sense. The question is: what is the cost of ceding control over our devices/machines in order to be able to watch netflix, etc. trparky Yeah and that's why Windows is the virus filled cesspool that it is today. Windows 10 is slowly changing Windows to be an app store based ecosystem in which all apps will be sandboxed. It's coming to the desktop near you. saf1927 I hope Magisk (or other similar mods in the future) keep working, so to prevent this. Not a problem on my Pixel XL since I haven't rooted it, but on my Nexus 5 Magisk allows it to pass Safety Net even though it's running a custom ROM (7.1.2) and it's rooted. Hendrik Leppkes SafetyNets primary purpose is to secure devices for Android Pay, and when you deal with actual money transactions on your device, you really don't want any hack interfering with it - so I'm quite certain they'll do whatever they can to break hacks like this and ensure the security and integrity of the device. h4rr4r No, its primary purpose is to make the device trustworthy for others not the person who paid for it. This is how it makes it "secure" for android pay. You are a possible threat and this closes that. Suicide_Note It would seem that Google is erecting a wall around their garden, too. EowynCarter While Apple opens iOS more and more. YouNex According to the support/help page, a device is not certified if it stops getting Android updates. How fuck up is that ? I don't get it. My Moto X has always been on stock ROM, yet it's showing up as non certified. Yes it's rooted + system modifications, but at no point is it stated that root prevents it from being certified. Suicide_Note Really? You can't understand why your rooted/system modified device is non-certified? YouNex I know how to read, but this is vague https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/b6f710b8628f0e09ab73ba144c133a2c9b1fe1325b353ae7dc1636f2776b2ac0.png "Not secure" jonzey231 Root and/or unlocked bootloader = Not certified. YouNex It says nothing about root or bootloader https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/b6f710b8628f0e09ab73ba144c133a2c9b1fe1325b353ae7dc1636f2776b2ac0.png ast00 Can't wait until LastPass excludes root users... Fuck them. Adonis K. If they do, I'm cancelling my subscription... Naxx ENVY Fuck them and yet they haven't done anything yet ... #internetlogic Also i know right , crazy for a company that stores your passwords to make themselves more secure . ABSOLUTE CRAZY , RAGE RAGE RAGE Jordan Palmer I don't understand your reasoning or rationale for these two statements. ast00 The second part is related to Google. Sorry about the confusion. Believe it or not, most of us root users keep SELinux in it's Enforcing state. This means we are safe. Nothing gets root rights without us knowing. Our phones are just as safe if not safer than most stock phones. JATIN BANSAL SafetyNet test can be passed using Magisk Manager. I am using it and it works fine for me. Even in play store, my device is certified. May be this helps someone. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/3756499ff5876545740cd0e88e38961bb2c327d90fc43f5801f4bce5d802c990.png https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/44185f640490cb506a68a3414579bd345123f7d52ee2e11802d31d5141db11ae.png Nick Most people are worried about the future when the exploits that Magisk uses are patched and it continues to make it harder for people to get around this. JATIN BANSAL That's what I am also worried about. I just posted this for those who are already rooted and for now want to keep the root. My main purpose of rooting was to flash lineage OS. I think custom rom is the only way of staying updated to latest version of Android as google itself doesn't update their phones after 2 years (18 months I think) for reasons they have. I think if someone buys a flagship device which costs 700$+, it should have 3-4 years of full software update support. 😆😄 2 years of major OS version updates and 3 years of security patches. After 3 years, its time to buy a new phone cuz its so old anyway. trparky Says you! Windows 7 was released on July 22, 2009 and they still support it EIGHT YEARS LATER! And they plan on supporting it until the year 2020 which means it will be supported for a total of ELEVEN YEARS! If Microsoft can do it, Google can too!!! Does Microsoft suddenly say "Your machine is too old, go buy a new one"? No, they continue to give you Windows Updates for years later. We should also be demanding that the Android OEMs do so as well. A Samsung Note 5 has more than enough hardware in it to run Android 7 but no... we can't do that, we need to make money so we don't update them to force you to buy a new device. Lambdadelta Magisk...alright, thanks for the tip-off. I really must get it. TadMSTR Magisk doesn't always pass SafetyNet. I have some devices it fails on. However, several other devices it works just fine. Make sure you turn on the hide root option, it's off by default. Lambdadelta Well, I do have a problem, and that is my device is not able to download it directly from Google Play, so I have to get the APK from XDA. I dunno why this is the case for my phone though. Is it because it's a 4.4.4? Either way, I'll get the APK moved to my phone later tonight. Teodor Axel Johan Jönsson I have activated hide root option, and it passes SafetyNet, but in Google Play Store, it still shows uncertified. What app should I hide root from to get Play Store to show Certified? JATIN BANSAL As per XDA: Q: Safety Net fails after enabling MagiskHide A: Magisk can only hide Magisk core features, for Magisk modules it depends on what the module does. If your ROM itself is not able to pass SafetyNet, then there is nothing Magisk can help. Your best bet is 100% stock ROMs, because your phone manufacturer is forced to release a device passing CTS. Teodor Axel Johan Jönsson What in Magisk Hide did you check/how did you do it? Google Play Store? Or Play services? Because here it says uncertified :( JATIN BANSAL Just clear app data of play store. Now it will show your device certified Teodor Axel Johan Jönsson Thanks! Muzaffar I believe that root and custom rom makes android what it is now. This feels like betrayal for Android enthusiast. username_not_valid Well maybe in the very early days (maybe), but not any more. Rooted phones make up a tiny fraction of active devices. Muzaffar It's not about active devices. It's about how android develop together with community (well as i remember) I believe that those "rooted user" contribute many things that make android right now. I still remember status bar (and nav bar) color change was implemented on Kitkat before it becomes official on lollipop. Also, we can't forget how badly mobile active network bug happens in lollipop if it's not those "rooted user" who found out the fix via xposed. and i believe there are still more. trparky We can blame the OEMs for that kind of stuff because of things like locked bootloaders, eFuses, etc. username_not_valid Or we can blame ROM makers for it because they kept breaking the devices causing warranty claims. Naxx ENVY no offence but that's small thinking ... i'd say 90% of people on Android devices don't want or even know about root, heck it may even be 95% ... security is more of a concern, sure it annoys us geeks, but that's the 5% at most. Muzaffar And about half of android devices is left outdated. Not to mention bugs that unsolved on previous android. I'll pick a dumb phone instead, if android becomes a closed platform. trparky And truth be told that's why I have an iPhone. I simply got sick and tired of the lack of updates so I told myself I'm going to the iPhone and have been happy ever since. OK sure, it may not have all of the customization features that Android has but I can be guaranteed that I will get software and security updates on time, every time, regardless of my carrier of choice. refthemc I think you misread his comment, he's saying that root and custom roms got Android to where it is TODAY not saying that it is necessary TODAY. And I agree. trparky It pretty much comes down to this. Google is simply targeting a much larger piece of the pie. You can't blame them for trying to do what is necessary to protect not only the platform but the Android brand itself. Qwip Well, it isn't like there is anywhere else to go though, is it? Google can basically throw enthusiasts who have promoted and fostered android development under the bus - they don't need them any more. trparky Money trumps community. Always has, always will. username_not_valid Ad blocking was the last holdout reason to root for me, but even thats no longer a good reason with things like Adhell, Adguard etc I have no other reason to root now, custom ROMs are generally garbage, and bloat can usually be uninstalled or disabled, so its just not needed. Adonis K. custom ROMs have nothing to do with root... thevigilante Custom ROMs have uncertified flag in Play Store Mike Avellanosa Not all, though George Byers My Nexus 7 2013 is passing safteynet running Lineage unrooted. Wilton Daniel Pinto Let me guess, you have a Pixel. Or you wouldn't call custom ROMs bloated while the reality is other way round username_not_valid Wouldn't touch a Pixel actually. username_not_valid Should be noted that I didn't call custom ROMs bloated, I guess you misread it. Wilton Daniel Pinto Oh yeah, I misread it . My bad Zach Mauch This is going to cause the same problem I see in governments work with security. They will blindly block things like root and bootloader unlock regardless of if it poses any credible threat because it FEELS more secure. Blah!!!!!! Naxx ENVY it IS more secure, not just " feels" h4rr4r More secure for them, not for me the owner of the device. Besides, not even for them in the long term. An up to date ROM has many exploits patched that a two versions out of date and 12 months behind on security patches OTA has. Zach Mauch What I mean is they will apply restrictions because they easily can and it gives a warm fuzzy for them. They will do this regardless of the impact to the user. The analogy here is that in my job I am constantly unnecessary restrictions and bureaucracy that make doing my job much more difficult. For instance, we are disallowed from using remote desktop on standalone computer networks. It would make our job MUCH MUCH easier in many circumstances and save money on software as I could remote into my PC from anywhere in the building. Yet they deny us that and claim security. jonzey231 So this will force people to install apps from unauthorized sources, thus making the whole Android malware issue that much more prevalent. Great.. Suicide_Note Unless being held at gunpoint, no one is forced to install apps from unauthorized sources. That's a user's CHOICE. jonzey231 You know what I mean. Stop playing devil's advocate on everyone's posts. Eric Braun He's not incorrect. Kyle R Krcmaric "Stop providing an alternate viewpoint to my own." It's just comments. Anyway, I think Google also announced that even sideloaded apps will get scanned by their new Google Play Protect service, which may help nullify the risk of sideloading in the first place. d0x360 That's not an alternate viewpoint unless your view is "don't install any apps ever" There is no logical argument to defend this move by Google. None. username_not_valid Yes there is. Come content creators will not allow a provider to support a rooted or otherwise compromised device. Right or wrong in your eyes thats the reality, and in order for Android to be able to have such services Google have to do this. d0x360 What you said isn't an alternate viewpoint lol you are just repeating the reason Google is doing this which everyone agrees is a fact. As for this new comment...a rooted phone isn't compromised. Tell me...what would a rooted user do with Netflix that would make Netflix want to block them? Are they worried about people copying movies because if they think Android is the vector for that action they are idiots. All they are doing is making a problem by allowing bad actors to inject malware into a Netflix apk that could be installed by both root and unrooted users. Genius! Give me 1 good reason to block rooted phones from an app like oh I dunno, Mario run or whatever it's called. Any answers you give are false. Wanna know why? Hacked apks exist to allow cheating and they can be installed by anyone rooted or not. In fact I'd stake my life that your average unrooted user is installing more modified apk files to cheat in games or whatever than any rooted user. People who root are generally better educated about the Android eco system and do less dumb stuff. As for Netflix I cancelled my account on the day they did this and now I just use a friends account so they lost a subscriber due to this move and I rarely ever used the app. Sure 1 person closing an account that's existed since the day they opened isn't going to do much but I vote with my wallet and if a company does something I dislike then they simply don't get my money. The first person I asked gave me their login info and I made a profile. It's just like how I share my HBO subscription with someone else. Easy easy. username_not_valid See my previous comment. Its not for me to argue, the fact is content providers want it, fair or not, end of story, therefore its going to happen. The tiny number of rooters out there are meaningless to them, and Google. Netflix has to do this because the providers of its non-original content demand it. Its not Netflix fault, they either do it or lose shows. Losing large amounts of their content would affect their subscription base several orders of magnitude more than losing rooted users, who chances are, use the service on more than their phone or tablet anyway. d0x360 Once again I ask... what about a rooted device is dangerous to an app and also this is now a second question, what makes it compromised? BAlGaInTl Clearly you've made up your mind on the issue, but I'll give it a go. It isn't necessarily the root that is dangerous to an app or vice versa. The compromise comes from other apps/processes that can take advantage of root. If you don't understand that, then you don't understand what root really is. It has a lot of valuable uses, but it can also be dangerous. To address your previous statement, just because it rubs me the wrong way. So your "solution" was to cancel your Netflix account and then steal the content? So clearly, you aren't "actually" affected by the change, because you can still watch Netflix. You do realize that watching their content is also valuable to them and makes them money? If you want to boycott Netflix for their practices, then by all means do. Otherwise, it just comes across as hypocritical IMHO. d0x360 I don't believe I asked you. No I'm not stealing Netflix content, it's being paid for and Netflix has many times in the past encouraged account sharing. Of course they did so in the hopes you would join but they still allow it. I paid my Netflix dues. Day 1 4 disc member, then as soon as it was available I upgraded to the 4k 4 user package. It's not piracy either, I'm not recording or distributing the content. If Netflix wants to dick with me I'll dick with them. I never said this was permanent but I vote with my wallet. Vote cast. I also haven't used Netflix once since that day despite being able to. I've been using Amazon and Microsoft video where I own over 500 movies so you can stuff the whole theft argument. I've bought more content than most and that doesn't include my DVD, Blu-ray, and uhd Blu-ray collection which is well over 1400 movies and TV shows at this point. Your right...I've been rooting since the first Android phone but I totally don't understand the possibilities. My argument is simple. The overwhelming majority of root users don't mess with apps. To hell with that nonsense argument anyways. What is the danger to Netflix? Copying movies? Please...it's a million times easier to do it on a PC. Even windows xp can handle it without issue. Does Netflix and you I suppose really think root users are using the app to steal content? If so how? Show me one forum topic, one article, one modified Netflix apk that allows downloading and bypassing their drm. I'm begging you. Just 1. BAlGaInTl I reviewed the Netflix TOS, and I will agree that you are not stealing. I'll even remove the verbiage from my post. Netflix does not make any such stipulation. They speak only of the "Account Owner" and "Devices." I guess I just assumed that, and that's my bad. As I've said in other posts... It isn't all about Netflix. A large part of it is about their content. They really can't argue that point with providers. You either play by their rules, work to establish new rules, or choose not to carry them. Netflix wants to stay relevant on all platforms. That's the main danger to Netflix. In addition, I shouldn't have to give an example in the wild of an exploit. Just because it is difficult to find doesn't mean it doesn't exist. What if someone else writes an app that uses root to mine user account data from Netflix? Should Netflix not be worried about protecting user data? If that happens, who is responsible for the security and the bad press? Probably not Netflix, but they would certainly be impacted. I checked my app really quick (which is stuck on version 4 because I'm affected). Since Netflix keeps you logged in for convenience (that's spelled out in their terms), a quick look gives my full name, username, phone number, zip code, the brand of payment card, and the last 4 digits of that card. That's quite a bit of information that can easily be gathered by a piece of Malware. Now as I said... Netflix probably wouldn't be liable if a user was compromised because of root. It would certainly be a danger to their business however. Why should the be asked to take that risk? It seems to me that they are approaching this in a realistic manner, and rolling it out in a reasonable way. Would this affect the majority of root users? Probably not. By their nature, root users will find ways around it anyway. The problem is that the impact to Netflix from losing content and/or a compromised app is disproportionate the loss of blocking root users. It's simply a numbers game, and you can't blame Netflix for that. And you certainly can't blame Google who is trying to improve security. username_not_valid Thats not for me to decide, or argue, the fact is the content providers have decided that rooting is a risk to their copyrighted content, and as such services like Netflix, Amazon, and other streaming services must comply and lock out rooted devices. Passing safetynet and using Googles DRM framework is the easiest way to claim due diligence, so thats what they will do, and in order to keep Android competitive Google is providing the tools needed to make it possible. What I will argue though is that your notion that custom ROMs etc are more secure is unfounded. The best might well be, but there are hundreds of completely random and unchecked ROMs out there that could contain absolutely anything, you cant possibly claim that custom ROMs are inherently safer or more secure than OEM ROMs, outdated or not. jonzey231 So let's play this out: If someone takes the Netflix .apk and mods it with malware and then signs it, it will pass installation on the device. 1. User opens app. 2. App does whatever shitty thing it's designed to do while the user thinks they just got around the block. 3. The OS scans the app and warns the user it's been modified and they should uninstall it. 4. User thinks "Ha! I know and that's why it works!" 5. User keeps app until they get a call from Credit Karma that their identity was probably stolen but they don't know how. 6. Person spends 6 months fixing stolen identity. But still uses that app the whole time. Ultimately, that user is still going to be screwed. Would you or I make this mistake? No. Would your cousin's friend's dad because he had his son root so he could tether for free and overheard you guys talking about sideloading apps and googled how to do it? Yes. Randroid Problem is, even in your scenario, root has nothing to do with it. Someone who is not rooted could do the same thing. The only problem is, now MORE people who root are going to be *forced* to look for a modified apk because the official apk is not available from the Play Store. So in the end, it's causing more problems than it's fixing. Corbin Baxter Here's the thing about rooting: when you alter your devices software like that, then Google shouldn't be responsible for anything that comes afterwards for the user. This just helps discourage rooting, which can alter a new users perspective on Android, or make someone reconsider getting an Android device. someone755 For what it's worth, back in 2011/2010, many of us bought into Android *because* we could root. Imagine the possibilities of being in control of so much more of your system than with any mobile OS prior; We've spent hundreds (some, thousands) of dollars in this environment, on devices, apps, books etc. I understand this isn't how things stand nowadays, but root is still prevalent because of one issue that Google will not fix (or at least, won't until O+ is running on the majority of devices, but that'll take two years at the minimum), and those are updates and vendor apps (i.e. bloatware). If my phone is stuck on Lollipop I'm going to root it; I'll be able to mitigate the memory leak performance drops, and overall customize the device to fit my specific needs -- I've made quite a few friends (think ROM and kernel devs) because I just wanted to put a thermal engine better than Qualcomm's horrendous MPDecision into the kernel directly (i.e. I took the kernel source and modified it to fit my needs). What Google is trying to do here is, yes, discourage rooting, but instead of fixing the root cause (heh) behind why people root in the first place (that is, again, customizability and personal(ized) performance tuning, in large part to keep devices on older Android versions alive), root wouldn't be necessary. In the long run this *might* fix the symptom, but it most definitely will not help in fixing the cause. And that's because the cause is Google itself. As if apps like Snapchat blocking power users from their apps wasn't enough, now there's this -- If it becomes so common that even Google's own apps start to utilize the feature, I'll be gone to another mobile platform within a month. That might mean iOS, it might mean S60v3, I'll know that if (or rather, when) it happens. tl;dr: Google is putting a band-aid on a shotgun wound. Corbin Baxter I'm speaking mainly for new Android users. They don't feel as comfortable rooting. Doing this makes Android SEEM more like iOS. This doesn't MAKE Android like iOS. New users are comfortable with that. This is the same issue Microsoft had with Windows 8/8.1. Classic users, and Windows enthusiasts, hated someone changing the way they would use their computers. Microsoft introduced a different way of doing things, and to enthusiasts, it was bad, no matter how good it might be. Google's Project Treble should mostly fix the fragmentation problem, therefore giving Android users one less reason to root. To us enthusiasts, nothing can beat rooting, but it might not be the best solution to the problems Android has. Google seems intent on fixing the problems rooting tries to solve, but in a higher-quality and reliable way. No hard feelings😉 trparky They won't understand that, they're too blinded by their geek rose colored glasses. Corbin Baxter I don't expect everyone to understand, but I'll be happy if even a small handful understand what Google is doing here. Dmitri Smirnov > when you alter your devices software like that, then Google shouldn't be responsible for anything that comes afterwards for the user. As if right now Google or the OEMs are in any ways responsible for the malware or unpatched firmware vulnerabilities that stay this way for year. But yes, the users that root are the problem. Corbin Baxter For unrooted phones, yes Google and OEMs are very responsible. But after you root, Android loses most of its security and stability, and rooting is basically tinkering with core system files. Google doesn't have any control over what the user can or can't do after that. bekifft That wasn't even a devil's advocate, that was a straight up strawman. Frosted Butts Yes.. please tell me about all the Netflix alternatives i can install, that can legally stream from Netflix...... Right now, if i am rooted and want Netflix (a service i am paying for), i must go through 3rd party app stores to install the APK. There is no choice at all... R Firestone ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ Umm you have the choice to unroot your device. Maxr1998 ..which is a bad choice for many. d0x360 Yes you do except I rooted my device to make it MORE secure. Unrooting would make my device less secure than sideloading apps would. username_not_valid People can keep saying that, but the content providers have no way to know whether or not you have taken measures to secure your custom device, whereas if they go down this root they know its handled. BAlGaInTl "whereas if they go down this root they know its handled" I see what you did there. 😆😄 ...or just watch Netflix from Chrome! You could even do this from a Linux box with root! 😃 Suicide_Note Sure there is: unroot. Problem solved. neoKushan "I've solved this problem by creating 3 more problems - but it IS solved!" Eric Braun https://www.amazon.com/Netflix-Inc/dp/B005ZXWMUS Option C .. ?? h4rr4r A choice that is now more popular. dcdttu It's not so much about what a user chooses to do. It's about probability. The probability that sites are going to try to lure users into downloading malware-infected Netflix APKs from 3rd party sites is going to go up if you can't download it from a safe source in the first place. This is just like the fact that, if you don't give drug users a safe and clean place to shoot up, they're going to go do it somewhere else that's much more dangerous. Both of these scenarios are bad for society in general, no matter what the original intention was. kgptzac 1/10. Gotta try harder. Premsuraj How? Google Play Protect will still catch malicious apps makapav Yes but you're potentially making people venture through shady sites to get the APKs. Eric Braun Or to Amazons App store or Fdroid. The people going to shady sites are already going there, this isn't going to increase the traffic by any real amount. tehboogieman Are you sure that Google will continue allowing GPP for unlocked or rooted users going forward? Not to mention that it's not a silver bullet for 0days d0x360 It barely works as is. There are tons of apps that slip through every day. Krebs on security reports on them quite frequently. I don't trust Google's scanning of apps at all which is why I root. I can make my phone more secure and I can also image the device as often as I want so if something does happen it's fixed within 5 min. If I unroot then I lose the protection along with the backups. Premsuraj Custom ROMs and root can't protect from 0days either. And just out of curiosity how is root going to provide more security? If anything it makes the device less secure tehboogieman Nobody said root makes a device more secure. Blocking root users from downloading apps from the Play Store puts users at more risk since those users will be more inclined to sideload apps from sources that might not be as reliable as the Play Store. Premsuraj The only people who cares about this are the people who root. And those user's generally tend to be more knowledgeable about what kind of apps and app stores they can trust. ASYOUTHIA✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ And only <2% of users will do this to keep rooted. xxTheGoDxx Only the plus 50 - 100 Million users that have root: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=eu.chainfire.supersu ASYOUTHIA✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ You do realize that that's just downloads right? ...not active users. blindexecutioner I'm not mad. I continue to use things like magisk to help get around stuff like this. All this will do is encourage me to use unauthorized sources for offending apps if magisk ever stops working. There is a reason I use Android over iOS and it certainly isn't because the apps are better designed or whatever. brian. Magisk is a good way around this. However, I don't know how long this will last. I would think with security in mind and developers trying to monetize more, it will put pressure on Google to make SafetyNet get triggered much easier. Obviously, I don't have any way of knowing, but this could easily turn into a cat and mouse game more than it already is. Android Pay was first, other apps did it like Super Mario Run, which who cares, but now Netflix? Changes are coming, and it doesn't look good for the rooting community. D13H4RD2L1V3 I'm not sure if everyone gets why some of us went through the trouble of gaining SU access. Sure, maybe there's a few who went through all that trouble for nefarious purposes (and maybe that got regulatory bodies concerned to the point where Google even needed to consider this) but from my perspective at least, a lot of us gain Superuser access mainly to get features that we liked on other Android flavors, especially in the case of a build of Android that's very close to Google's vision. Such as the ability to hide the navbar at any time we wanted and also to gain theming support (which I feel should be added officially sooner rather than later because I absolutely hate how Google is making their already-bright UI even more eye-searing with even more white-colored elements, which also makes the benefits of OLED much less obvious). I wouldn't be as concerned if these features were pushed to AOSP soon, but as it stands, I feel that Google should probably think about making these features available soon. Marty Thank the bad apples for why you no longer have freedom. Jeremy ディリマ Would changing region firmware with Odin flag the SafetyNet check on Samsung mobiles? Soz if it's a stupid question a lot has changed since I last fiddled with Android Christopher Robert This was a long time coming. Once root user started using root to pirate software, and/or get around geo locks, instead of using it to add feature to their firmware or improve their devices performance, it was only a matter of time before it all got torn down. h4rr4r Get around geo locks? You mean have my device report the location I want it to report? Yeah, how terrible that I control what my computer does. dizel123 You still do. This doesn't affect that at all h4rr4r You said the justification for that was people using their devices for their own reasons in the way they liked. I was pointing out that this is a normal thing and not something that should be punished. Cuvis You don't need root to pirate. You never did. Marty Apple says, Thank you. h4rr4r Sounds like we need a new FREE platform. Maybe Amazon can use this to push their store. mxwp but will the Netflix from the Amazon App Store work on rooted phones? Curt RIP Root. I'm not moving from stock anymore, just cab with the hassle. Until there's a 'reliable' way to hide from Safety Net, I'll enjoy my Android Pay, banking apps and overall smoothness. (If it was up to me, I'd be rooted with Linage) h4rr4r IOS is the platform for you. That was the deal from the beginning. hp-fourtwenty magisk....giyf .y phone is rooted with lineage 14.1, and passes safetynet. problem solved! jcopernicus Fantastic news. Lawstorant All this butthurt for what? You all sound like Magisk doesn't exist. Dave Hamilton Lets take Apple and there closed source. Lets take Google and there open source, the freedom to do and change as you please to make the device yours. No two devices have to be the same. Lets get 115 million android users, and then start deciding you no longer have this choice and freedom to do what you want! When something gets better and better, its only a matter of time before all the things you love are removed and comersilised Eric Braun You still have the option to do what you want. However like everything there are reactions for every action. Want to root or unlock your device? Sure, however there may be a few apps that no longer appear in the playstore. May want to have a backup like Amazon App Store or something similar ready. No one is stopping you, feel free to do as you please. tehboogieman Man, if I have to choose between having a device with root or a device with apps that use day to day, the iPhone goes from a 1% chance of being my daily driver to about 50% There are still a lot that can Android can do that iOS can't, but if I'm living in a walled garden the iPhone is looking pretty attractive. 5+ years of official OS support, solid retail network for quick service or hardware exchanges. The Play Store is my main source of apps that I know are vetted and generally safe. I have no desire to manage app updates manually. There is always a chance that someone will build and maintain an appstore that will have all root blocked apps (maybe the future of APKMirror?). If not it might be the death of Android for users like me Eric Braun Even without all of this I would use an APKMirror App that allowed for updating of apps automatically. dizel123 Google gives app developers more control over their apps. Whiny entitled internet crybabies go on the internet and whine and cry. Aka...Thursday neoKushan Alternatively: Google restricts users from using their device, which they own, how they see fit. dizel123 Except Google isn't restricting anyone from doing anything. But being 100% wrong has never stopped anyone in the internet NubCake being an asshole (in your case) hasn't stopped anyone from commenting eather it seems. dizel123 I can admit to being an asshole. But I'm also right so it's all good. neoKushan It's certainly not stopping you. dizel123 I haven't experienced it so of course it's not stopping me trparky You may own the hardware but you don't own the software, you only have a license to use it. Csöpi Thats so greate. I have a stock oneplus one and for some strange reasons i was failing the test beforhand, but now its all green. Still cant update the netflix app hence chromecast isnt working either anymore. Not really happy. JC If there's a will there's a way. brian. If more developers get on board with this, I can't see why I would switch to Android. I've always been curious about new Android phones, bought a bunch and rooted them all if I could. This is not good for a person like me. d0x360 If Google keeps this up and app devs include the api to block rooted phones then my days using Android will be over and Google will have lost a user who's been there since the g1. I don't know what I'd switch to... probably windows mobile because I'm not a fan of apple whatsoever. It's really a shame because if I had to guess I'd say 99.99% of people who root do so for either the added security and or customized experiences. For example I use root to modify my status bar and quick panel as well as firewall my apps and use adaway and yes Google I do whitelist sites that aren't obnoxious with their ads. John Doe All the more reason for the APK mirror appstore LoL Jan-Lk Else Yeah Google want's us to buy tooooo expensive phones to just get the latest Android, because cheap phones suck at updates and so they need to be flashed and rooted... trparky But if the community raises holy hell with the OEMs then maybe it will be corrected. There's no damn reason why a three year old device can't be updated when an eight year old Windows 7 machine is still receiving Windows Updates. McStagger WHY DOES NETFLIX CARE IF THE PHONE IS ROOTED?!?!?!?! mxwp Netflix does not care, but the content creators that make the stuff you see on Netflix do care. They care because they are idiots who think it is easier to pirate from rooted phones. bekifft Again, Google becomes more and more restrictive. I switched from iPhone because the screens were too small, and Google was far less restrictive. Both of those issues are now resolved, and Google's upped the price of their device to match Apple. May as well switch back to iPhone, Google seems to support it just as much as Android anyway. Luxferro Except it's not just rooted users! Any device with an unlocked bootloader. hp-fourtwenty Your comment sucks for misinforming users about what safetynet is....has NOTHING to do with unlocked bootloaders. Luxferro Sure it does. My Nexus 6P only has an unlocked bootloader, and Netflix disappeared from the play store after the last update. And I'm not the only one, so I suggest you do some reading. TechGuy22 more reason for me to pirate hey, have at it Matías Duarte I hope Netflix does the same with Jailbroken iOS devices. Why they do this btw? To prevent people recording their movies? You can do that with Windows.. Knowledgeborn Allah In all honesty, that'll probably never happen. Jailbreaking iOS opens the doors to a lot of customization on an iPhone, but the security issues are often minimal (with the exception being not having the latest software version). Jailbreaking is pretty much filtered through the Cydia platform. You don't have access to the entire system with a jailbreak. Rooting is completely different, because you can completely reshape the core OS. fbl Note : I don't work for Netflix so I can't comment for them. Possible causes : - the right holders might be pushing for this. I work on roughly the same product area and we don't implement DRM because we like them, we implement them because we contractually have to. -Netflix is tired of getting low notes because of crashes coming by shitty hacks in custom roms. Zach Mauch Anyone know how chromebooks will be affected by this? Will dev mode being enabled cause you to fail SafetyNet Checks? That is currently the only way to install apks on Chromebooks. Branko But Android AOSP!11 -Google 2011 How the times how changed. Wayne Randall ALT arguement, because I don't have time to read every comment... This doesn't limit me and my rooted N6P at all, this move limits how much money they (the devs and Google) are going to make. I can't buy it (the app or coins, or special characters, or bonus content, w/e) if I can't see it. Plain and simple. The important apps will still be there. No app is worth unroot. Block Project Fi from root though... weeeellll. I guess I'd unroot for that. mxwp yeah, only Netflix, banks, and big names will use these blocks. i am guessing most devs want as much exposure as possible. PVL_93_RU Google is actively trying to kill the modding community. Not the Custom ROM makers, but people who root and install Xposed. All because they compromise the security for Android Pay I fear the day root and Xposed apps start disappearing from the Play Store trparky If it comes to security vs being open, security will always win (or at least should always win). Eric Koop I had my Shaw Gateway app update yesterday and they changed it so it doesn't work if rooted. So I had to uninstall and find an APK online of an older version. Now it's just a matter of time before I forget and re-install the update. What a pain... disqus_em5YfkbWdk Well this would certainly get me to cancel Netflix. My personal Plex server is far better than Netflix could ever be anyway. Vivek Rameses Becoming apple more and more every day. Disgusting. Knowledgeborn Allah Android is starting to look more and more like iOS with each update... ¯_(ツ)_/¯ trparky Open platforms rarely stay open once the Benjamins start rolling in. hp-fourtwenty Go ahead and block me...I'll just pirate your app. Play nice and so will I. Start poking me and I'll poke back by never giving you another penny. App devs can't beat XDA devs. It's not going to happen. My unlocked, rooted, rommed and modded device still passes safety net. The day that stops, so does the flow of money leaving my hands on the play store. Luxferro Lay off the sodas.... UniBroW Question, can those of you without access to Netflix on Google play, can it be installed from the Amazon App Store? Stanley C. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/dd381b7e8a39df74c4725712a0db906098c965e9ee4194b6e01e020fd69ee566.png Thats how magisk is made... Magic! Marti Abernathey Yawn. I've got a rooted device and just installed Netflix... because? Magisk. As soon as they made this choice I cancelled. Not because I can't get around it, but because they make me do that. mrjayviper even on a non-rooted LOS mis 5s+, I cannot install Netflix. unlocking the bootloader already tripped safety. And I don't want to root. The features available in non-rooted LOS is enough for me. Teh BuG No. Bueno. TedPhillips Sigh. What's the over-under on this becoming pervasive in the play store... MicroG / Fdroid I'm coming soon. World needs a solid single alternative gcm replacement to catch on. TedPhillips As far as the potential for support overhead, being rooted is generally less than the pain coming from the Xposed/magisk crowd. You need to be actively interfering with an app via root vs code being injected into low levels of the framework that everything uses. TedPhillips I think the best outcome could be that Google opens up their process for little guys to certify there own rom builds, ala let's encrypt lowering friction on getting ssl setup. AOSP should not be a functionally useless base implementation for I'm roms, but something you can use in​ practice. TedPhillips Hey guys, don't worry. Google says Android is for everyone. https://www.android.com/everyone/ That includes AOSP developers too, right? That website seems to tread the line pretty carefully, ala 'no one is forcing you use Google play' but Hiroshi's quote seems like it comes with a grain of salt since he owns Play. I'd love to see AP interview him about this. qkjDlav As an app developer for a large app used globally, the two biggest time wasters in a developer's life are a) debugging device specific issues (HTC, Samsung, etc) and b) crash logs with Xposed in the stack trace. Developers are tired of having to sit around with device farms at their desks just to make sure new features and changes work with each quirky variant of Android that manufacturers want to deploy, and custom roms do make it worse. Enthusiasts are welcome to customize their own versions of Android and sideload apps, but we don't want to see crashlogs in the Developer Console from rooted/custom ROM users. And companies probably don't want to keep paying us to debug issues that only a small minority of users will see. Lê Nguyên Chương Most stupid thing I've ever heard in my life.

Netflix was just the start: Google Play Console lets developers exclude app availability for devices that don't pass SafetyNet Rita El Khoury Follow View All Posts 2017/05/18 3:57am PDTMay 18, 2017 93 Plus 1 on G+ 108 Share on Facebook 82 Share on Twitter Total Shares283 Google News Last weekend, a huge turmoil swept the root-enthusiast Android community as it was discovered then confirmed that the Netflix app was being blocked from showing up in search results on the Play Store for rooted devices. At the time, Netflix said it was using Widevine to block unsupported devices, but that made no sense to us: the app was still functional if it was sideloaded, it was only not showing up as compatible in the Play Store. So what sorcery was Netflix really using?! Turns out it's a new function of the Google Play Console. As part of the updates announced for the Play Console at I/O 2017, Google mentions a new Device Catalog section under Release management that lets developers choose with intricate granularity which devices their app supports on the Play Store. Devices can be viewed and excluded by many attributes including RAM and SoC, but the important factor we're interested in is SafetyNet Attestation. New "Device catalog" lets devs manage the exclusions. Developers will be able to choose from 3 states shown in the top image: not excluding devices based on SafetyNet, excluding those that don't pass integrity, or excluding the latter plus those that aren't certified by Google. That means any dev could potentially block their apps from showing and being directly installable in the Play Store on devices that are rooted and/or running a custom ROM, as well as on emulators and uncertified devices (think Meizu and its not-so-legal way of getting Play Services and the Play Store on its phones). This is exactly what many of you were afraid would happen after the Play Store app started surfacing a Device certification status. This is different from the full SafetyNet API implementation that apps like Android Pay and Pokémon Go use. In the case of Pay/Go, the attestation check happens when the app is installed on your phone and doesn't allow it to run unless it passes the integrity test. But in the case of the Play Console, the attestation check happens when you're browsing the Play Store and only affects the availability of the app for your device. If the full SafetyNet API isn't included in the app itself, you will still be able to grab the APK from other sources, install it, and the app will work just fine. Still, this spells trouble for rooted users and the Android enthusiast community as a whole. Google keeps erecting more and more obstacles each day in the face of root and custom ROMs and even if this won't stop root users who should be knowledgable enough to know how/where to grab an APK and install it, it will make things more and more difficult and maybe less and less worth the trouble. But y'all are rebels and you'll keep on finding a way around it, won't you?

Nice move Google. Suicide_Note Not sure if serious, but either way, this was just a matter of time. YouNex Obviously not serious EowynCarter So, question : Is there anyway to get android O in the future on my nexus 6 and not having problems with this ? IF manufacturer where taking care of updating their devices, wouldn't be an issue... saf1927 If Magisk keeps working, yep. You can. Even my old Nexus 5 is on 7.1.2 and it passes SafetyNet. EowynCarter I want "just work" stuff. Not workaround. Maybe Magisk does the job for some, but not an acceptable solution from my point of view. Mainly the "we don't know if it will keep on working" part. saf1927 Well, it's the best solution so far and it has improved a lot since its inception. I never bothered since the Nexus 5 was a secondary device for me, but now that some apps won't show up anymore on the Play Store, I simply flashed Magisk and that's about it. I haven't tweaked anything. Plus, if you are already flashing a custom ROM, flashing an extra zip file isn't that much work anyway. EowynCarter True, but it's the phone I use dailly. I don't want apps sudendly not working, becasue google decided to push an update that broke magisk. mxwp well if you want things to "just work" then i guess get an iPhone EowynCarter Sadly, I'm beginning to think about that. But that would cause others frustrations. ED-Zが現れた! Well, people will just flock to root-supported apps... Milton P. I actually forgot when was the last time I Rooted a device. No biggie. Suicide_Note The bad thing is it isn't just root that causes problems. Simply unlocking the bootloader will produce the same result. Maxr1998 Just because it's no biggie for you, it doesn't mean everyone approves this. I am actually pretty concerned, because this limits the freedom over our devices even more.. Milton P. Define freedom, please. Maxr1998 Software freedom, to be more specific. You should have the freedom to use and modify your device and it's software however you'd like, and have fill control over it. That means, root access. And since the AOSP core IS free software, the 4 freedoms defined by Richard Stallman apply to it. What this change now introduces is that you're forced to decide between either giving up the freedom over your device or not using the app you wanted to download (which will probably have to be my choice, and that sucks). Milton P. But you're not giving up anything, you just have to make a choice. If you put that way, Google has the freedom of doing with the AOSP core whatever they want, the same way you can modify said core and do as you please, the difference is Google has more money and more responsibilities when it comes to their user base. XDA and other sites will still have a bunch of developers making whatever they please (within the AOSP terms) with the AOSP core. This will just change thinks for the people that use those ROMs bit realistically the vast majority of users won't feel the changes. Sad but true. h4rr4r That choice is giving up freedom you had before. The vast majority will see the rate of Android improvements slow as the Devs on XDA and the like lose interest. Android only exists because of Linux, now it is turning its back on that whole culture. Milton P. Well, I don't see your freedom compromised to be honest with you, but we're seeing things from different angles so that's that. Sorry for your loss in that case. h4rr4r You do not think losing control of your device is a loss of freedom? Milton P. Nope, is just a device, I have more important stuff going on, m device is a tool the same way a hammer is a tool, you can buy a hammer and use it as it is. Sometimes my device is a toy, if I buy a remote control car I'll modify it as long as it is possible, the same way I modify my phone. I have control over my phone. I can install whatever I want at my own risk. If I decide to root my phone I expect things to be broken. I remember when I had an HTC and I hated sense so I decided to install a custom ROM, I gave up the camera and I was aware of it. There was always some compromises with custom ROMs, nothing is changing. I rather have a safe device then a compromised one today, still my choice thou. h4rr4r So you want IOS. Got it. Over here I want freedom. I don't think homedepot should be allowed to tell me what I can hit with the hammer I bought. trparky Open platforms rarely stay open once they become popular. Once the Benjamins come rolling in it tends to override open. h4rr4r Tell that to Linus Torvalds. I am sure he will have many many fuck yous for you. trparky Linux is the rare situation. h4rr4r The rare situation like many others that created android and even google. trparky Yeah but look at Android, the walls are closing around it and there's nothing you can do about it. Face it man, the geeks may have built the system but the common man now rules it. Geeks love choice, yes, they do love their choice but your average person doesn't give a rat's ass about choice. All they want is a device that does what they need it to do when they want to do it. They have no inclination to learn how it works or why it works just as long as it does. This is what geeks do not and refuse to understand. h4rr4r Sure there is, stop using it. Then the common folks will have to follow us to the next platform. trparky As long as their is money involved in maintaining Android it doesn't matter if something better comes along, people will continue supporting Android because it makes them money. Money makes the world go round, get used to it. Maxr1998 ^ What @h4rr4r:disqus says. trparky Yep. The root and ROM community is such a small portion of the Android ecosystem that they really don't matter to them. People have been screaming at Google for years to get the Android house fixed up, this is them doing just that. You can't blame them for doing what the people have asked for. mxwp I agree with you, but sadly you only have freedom over hardware. You can do what you want with the device you buy. But with software you never actually buy it... you only buy a license to use it. Thus you have no real freedom with software. Maxr1998 Android is free software, Apache 2.0 license. At least the AOSP part of it. trparky But the Google parts of it are not covered under the Apache 2.0 license. That's essentially why ROM developers can't package the Google Play Services pack with the ROM itself and instead requires you to download a separate ZIP package from Google to install it separate from the ROM package. Android itself may be free and open but the Google Play Services part is not. Sudev There are far more than few arguments against root access but here are some: Root access is meant for experimental & development purpose and not for Daily Driver for any average user of the platform. Google Play Services & Apps available on Play Store are not "Free Software". Google as provider of Play Services infrastructure has much more liabilities then one can simply assume. And also the app developers have responsibility to protect end users' data. If device has root access available and any rouge app / maleware steals other apps data which is possible, who will be at stack? h4rr4r The ability to do anything I want with my things that I own. Milton P. You​ can do whatever you want with your device, nobody is stopping you. You might see that some apps are not showing up in the play store but you can still side load them, I still see freedom in your future. h4rr4r For how much longer? Soon these apps will ask play services if they are supposed to be installed on that device, at that point you can say goodbye to sideloading. If this is what people want then IOS was the platform for them. thecoolkid Ok Google, define freedom... 😁 Nick I would imagine a great deal of people on this site will be upset, but in actuality I don't think this will affect the user base of many apps that badly h4rr4r Not in the short term. However in the long term it will. Android only exists because of the FREE software movement. Nick Yes, but that doesn't apply to applications, which this is about. h4rr4r Think long term. Same thing applies. trparky No it won't because the root and ROM community is so small it doesn't matter to Google anymore. The 95% of people who simply want a device that works don't care and likely won't ever care. As long as they can play NetFlix, Pokemon Go, or whatever is the next craze they don't care. h4rr4r Again, that is short term thinking. Think past the end of your nose. Android exists because of linux. Google needs this small group to create the very stuff they rely on. trparky You overestimate the value that the community has now. Android may have needed the community back in the beginning to gain the foothold that it has in the market but not so anymore. Android has near 100% market penetration, they have achieved world domination. They don't need the community anymore, they have achieved their goals. h4rr4r Until they are unseated. IBM once had a monopoly on computing devices. They did not need the community to gain a foothold, they would not have a product to gain a foothold without the community. Android only exists because of a collection of those projects. trparky No, Android exists because Samsung, HTC, and LG make devices people want and it makes them money by the semi-truck full. The community doesn't mean shit now, all that matters to these companies is one thing... money, money, and more money. Oh, and did I mention money? This is capitalism man, money rules the world. If you don't make money you are dead. h4rr4r Please tell me how that would have happened without linux. Money loses to good engineering every day. Look at how linux killed solaris. trparky Tell me why Windows is the defacto monopoly on the desktop despite the fact that Linux is better in every damn way possible under the hood? That's right... money. h4rr4r Because the desktop is dead. The fight is over. They lost. Even money can't keep them relevant. trparky Oh, you're funny. The desktop is not dead, it will never be dead. When people need to do real work, they sit down at a desktop. When people want to play real games, they sit down at a desktop. When people need to type out anything longer than a page like a college term paper, they sit down at a desktop. The desktop is king and will always be king. Long live the desktop! h4rr4r The Desktop is a dead man walking. When they do real work, they use a Citrix session. When they game they use a console, or they are already nerds. When people type they can use a fucking chromebook. The desktop as you think of it died already. trparky Try and say that shit over at TechPowerUp, HardOCP, Overclock.net, TomsHardware, etc. and trust me when I say this... you'll be run out of town by people with pitchforks and torches. h4rr4r Those are all nerds. Those are the folks who have desktops running 3 different OSes. They are the folks who are pissed about android being locked down. trparky And your point being? You just admitted that only the "nerds" care about Android being open. Sure, those same "nerds" will go off and create a new platform but the rest of the people who are living in the real world and who don't care one damn bit about how it works will continue to use Android. h4rr4r Those people will eventually move to the new platform. Just like they did with Android. trparky And the same thing will happen to that platform in the future that's happening to Android now. Open platforms are nice and all, I'll admit that, but your average person doesn't care one bit. I dare you to go up to any person on the street and ask them anything about Android. What phone do they have? What model? Most will say "I don't know, something that my carrier gave me for cheap." h4rr4r The wheel of computing we call it. It has happened and will happen again. So what? trparky Which reinforces the idea that I said before, eventually all open systems will become closed (or less open) at some point in their life cycle. It usually happens when it becomes popular with the common man. Why? Because like I've been trying to get through your thick skull, the average person doesn't care how any of this stuff works so long as it works. h4rr4r The average person does not matter. Few open systems become closed. AOSP is still fine. trparky What the hell do you mean by "they don't matter"? They're the ones buying the devices, buying the apps, looking at the ads, etc. Just how the fuck does that translate to "they don't matter"? h4rr4r Because they don't. They don't create, they don't cause new things to be created. They are just users, just like I don't matter to how movies are created. trparky But without money from the people who are consuming said things developers won't make new stuff. Developers do have to eat you know and put a roof over their heads. h4rr4r The giant world of FOSS pretty much proves you wrong. Demand cannot create supply. I don't pirate anything kiddo. I have way too much to lose for that. One of those lawsuits I would actually have to pay, since I could. trparky I'll give a hint on how FOSS works a lot of the time. Some of the top tier Linux kernel developers actually work for companies and they just contribute code in their free time. They may work for Intel, AMD, nVidia, or God knows what but only after their day job is done. Why? Because they need money and they need to eat. This is a basic requirement for people in this world. They need money!!! People don't just write code for the love of it, even Linus Torvalds who's in charge of the Linux kernel itself works for the Linux Foundation and yes, he gets paid for his work to the tune of $10 Million a year. Sorry to burst your bubble man but FOSS projects aren't all happy, happy, joy, joy here... people need to be paid real money to be able to eat, drive a car, put a roof over their heads, etc. On second thought, I'm not sorry I burst your bubble! You need it burst! PEOPLE NEED TO BE PAID REAL FUCKING MONEY!!!! h4rr4r No, they get paid to contribute. During the work day. Not as a hobby. Lots of projects are like that. I won't say exactly how I know about that ;) Their employers just aren't as short sighted as you. Linus did not however create linux to get rich. Great code like great art gets created because it must be. People do what they love. Kid, you will get it one day. When you have enough that you aren't worried about it each day, money stops being that big of a deal. Don't worry everybody goes through a phase like you are now. trparky Dude, we are not the Federation of Planets here living in a happy, happy, joy, joy world in which people can just do whatever they want to do without a care in the world. As long as human greed exists there will always be a need for money. And believe you me, greed will never go away unless we breed a new kind of human and I don't see that happening any time soon. Gene Roddenberry's future will never happen, it just won't. Contrary to a lot of geek dreams it just won't. h4rr4r No idea where you got that idea. Never suggested it. My point was the personal relative value of increasing income drops as income goes up. If you make minimum wage doubling your income is a huge deal. Adding the same amount to my income would not get me to take a job I like less. Offering it to Linus would be a waste of time. Yes, some people will keep chasing dollars, they are the exception not the rule. The employers are working on enlightened self interest. Either they use the FOSS product, gain market advantage with direct knowledge, use it for marketing or believe they are getting something else. PostgreSQL for example has a lot of paid contributors who work for companies that either provide customization, consulting or depend on the project. Others just because it increases quality. Commercial software by and large is not high quality. I have seen a lot of it and 90% if you tried to submit it to a FOSS project of any size would get you denied and possibly mocked. This system continues to be more innovative because it is easy to continue to expand. Anyone with a good idea can fork if their idea is not accepted. trparky > My point was the personal relative value of increasing income drops as income goes up. Tell that to the people in Washington or any CEO that demands ever increasing yearly salaries and end of year bonuses all while raping the companies that they work for. Tell that to the psychopaths on Wall Street. For as long as their is money, people will want more of it. Anyone who says that they don't is flat out lying. h4rr4r Those are the exception not the rule. That is why you call them psychopaths. Honestly, correcting for inflation I really don't care that much if I ever make more. Would it be nice sure, would I give up anything I like about my job? No. If you could double my income but it prevented me from contributing to FOSS projects or owning code I generate off the clock, I would not take that deal. If money was enough to make people do anything MS would have offered Linus $11 million a year to not write it. Heck, Sun would have done it while they were still around. trparky Either you're a child that doesn't know how the adult world works or you're a fucking troll. h4rr4r So you have no idea who makes stuff, neat. I guess you think Henry Ford should have made a faster horse. trparky Oh, I know who makes the stuff I use but I also make sure that they are paid! I give money to those developers who write the programs that I enjoy and if I can't pay them I won't use their programs. I only use a program if I can pay for it. I have put money into their tip jars on their web site, I look for PayPal links and I donate even if it's something small like $5. They deserve it! h4rr4r Good for you! There is a lot of great software that does not make money that way. Some even just ask is that you follow the license, like linux which mediatek steals by not releasing kernel source. So I hope you avoid buying that kind of thing. trparky MediaTek controller chips are known to suck so I don't buy them out of that reason alone. h4rr4r Now I have given you another good reason to avoid them. Bunch of thieves. Rita El Khoury I don't even remember when I last bootloader unlocked. But I know this move toward closing the ecosystem further and further will have ripples in the future. The enthusiast community flocked toward Android for its openness and we have custom ROMs and their enterprising devs to thank for HUNDREDS of new features that they implemented first and everyone clamored for and applauded until they became features in AOSP. If Google thinks it can steer this ship alone and it knows best what to do next, we may have less and less interesting features in the future and more and more of what only one entity thinks is best, not a diverse set of opinions. Nick Given that this only gives the developer the option of requiring these checks, it makes me believe that Google had to do this for some companies that have regulatory or other kinds of requirements. Which is a shame for the rooted (and unlocked?) community, but understandable. Shame Google is most likely going to take the blame here in this comment section though. Rita El Khoury Well, maybe they had to, but that won't stop any developer from implementing it without any regulatory or legal requirement pushing them to do so. Nick Right, which puts this choice on the developer, not Google. Google was stuck behind a rock and hard place, perhaps. EowynCarter Well, google is certainly to blame for not planing to update my nexus 6 to android O. And now I can't even use custom rom as plan B without losing some apps :( Suicide_Note Boo hoo. Buy a new phone and quit crying that Google doesn't support phones forever. EowynCarter Fine can you order a pixel XL and ship it to me in France ? Plus, my nexus 6 still works, I hate having to replace working stuff. Makes no sense, economically and ecologically speaking. Suicide_Note I'll sell you my XL when I'm done with it, but only after i get the Pixel XL 2. :) EowynCarter Well, I do hope Google sells the "pixel 2 "( or whatever its name) here. For now, I'm'just hoping my nexus 6 don't break. Else I might jump on the iOS ship. I'm not convinced the the other android alternatives. Note 8 would be the closest, but touchwiiz, delayed updates.... I'm spoiled after a few years with a nexus. Suicide_Note There always eBay or Swappa if you want to get a first gen Pixel. I was looking at prices over the weekend, and mint condition Pixels are going for about $450. EowynCarter Not so much in France. And eBay for suff that cost more that a few bucks, too risky. Plus, the pixel is getting "old" by now. Wilton Daniel Pinto Troll found trparky Yet Microsoft still supports Windows 7 EIGHT YEARS LATER! How come Microsoft can do that yet Google can't? Alex Louderback Actually, that's Qualcomm EowynCarter Source for this ? trparky And Qualcomm can go fuck themselves. Gee... I wonder why they're being hit with an anti-trust lawsuit. Could this be one of many reasons why? trparky Yes, Google is to blame for that. There's no damn reason why your Nexus 6 can't run Android O other than the fact that they just don't want to. Bojan Bunić My bootloader was unlocked prior to changing the mobo on my 5X, courtesy of Booty Loops. Root, well, probably before I got my Nexus 4. Although I'll see how it'll go on in the future, as we don't have Pixels here, so the only near stock possibility is either OnePlus, or some other device and a custom ROM. Milton P. Agree 100% with you, I mean I remember the old days when I hated HTC's Sense, I literally decided that a phone without a camera was better than whatever HTC did back then, but Android has evolved quite a lot nowadays, don't get me wrong, I do believe that custom ROMs did a great job showing Google what the users want but that won't change, as long as someone shows Google what people want Google will keep improving Android, because there's no limits. Now if they go the Apple way and lock EVERYTHING then we'll be fucked, I'm the meantime developers will find a way around the system pushing Google along. Premsuraj An open bootloader and root actually solves a lot of problems still existing in AOSP. The Nougat update absolutely destoryed the battery life of many Nexus 6P devices, with Google only focussing on the Pixels, there was no fix in it. I unlocked, used Franco Kernel + naptime + Greenify and I now I get adequate battery life. Another feature I can think of is theming. Material design is good, but the whiteness is rage inducing Maxr1998 Well, fuck them. Let's just hope not many devs will use this, and Google won't enable this by default anytime soon. Maxr1998 The more I think about this, the more concerned I get. This will reduce the freedom over our devices, and also limit developers in the awesome things they could do before because of Android's openness. I am all in for device security and fighting against malware, trojans and phishing applications, don't understand me wrong, but that doesn't mean that you have to take people away their freedom - just look at how Linux (GNU and Linux) is doing it. Tom Westrick How does this limit developers? If anything it gives them more control. Maxr1998 Fair point, I should have been more specific. With "developers", I meant rom developers and modders, app developers only if they require root access for their apps. "Normal" developers can use this to enforce a "secure" (read: DRM locked-down) environment, but that's not really a good thing in my opinion.. (Refer to my other comments.) trparky You're angry at the wrong people, you should be angry at Hollywood; they're the ones that are demanding this kind of stuff. Their content, their rules; it's how things are in the real world. They have to do what they need to do to protect their investments, plain and simple. We don't necessarily have to like it, hell... we may even hate it, but that's how it is. You want the content? Play by their rules. Colin Richardson If you are an app developer and want your app to run on custom roms..... don't turn on "Requires SafetyNet"... bekifft We are increasingly living in the future Richard Stallman warned us about. With Google taking all these steps, may as well go back to using jailbroken iPhones. Bart Janusz I've already enabled it and I know at least 3 others devs that did it as well. I really don't care about root per se, but custom roms and xposed is source of countless problem as both are buggy as hell. Maxr1998 But in which way does that influence you? Xposed can introduce bugs to the system, sure, but it won't affect the performance of your app unless it itself is modded, so you probably don't have to fear bad reviews for bad performance anyway. And custom roms? LineageOS on my mother's Moto G runs like a champ and much better than the 5.1 stock rom before. And in my experience as a dev, there were much more incompatibilities with Samsung TouchWiz than with AOSP-based custom roms. refthemc I'm sure he's just trying to avoid the headache of emails he gets daily from users who have no idea that it's their fault the app is not working or crashing... Bart Janusz Indeed, not to mention extra crash and ANRs reports which seems to influence app positioning. Maxr1998 But why? The device may behave more buggy at some parts because of Xposed (and mine definitely ran like shit on MM because of some mods, but I NEVER blamed any apps), but the apps itself won't run worse if not modded - normally they should even run better if you only use performance mods like Greenify, NLP Collector wakelock disabler and other light mods. I don't think he gets many reports anyway, considering what @marcusmarcus2:disqus said. Bart Janusz You may not, but many users do, and as I said there are a lot of bogus ANRs and crash reports. Since my app depends heavily on low level OS elements both custom ROMs and xposed are deal breakers (and you really should check source, since I do not update my website as I moved to G+/FB but app has sizable user base given its niche and I'd to deal with ROM/xposed issues fequently). Maxr1998 Well, but the same type of users also give bad reviews etc. without using any mod or root. You generalize modders to only cause problems, and therefore lock out everyone. About your app/website thing: fair point, I didn't look at it yet, and have to apologize for being a little rude. marcusmarcus2 You need to take your own advice, "you really should check source". If you moved to G+/FB, then why does your app on the play store still point to the same website as well. Or at least put a link on the old website that directs to G+/FB. There is nothing that points to your so called G+/FB source. So @Maxr1998:disqus has no other source to check at the moment. Bart Janusz Not that I care but if you try to draw conclusion about app you should probably visit Play Store listing. Anyhow that's really not important I just chimed in to explain why developer will use this. I've choose to do so due to extra burden which in effect hurts majority of my user base, one of my colleagues cited lucky patcher and freedom (which I think is not such a good idea but its his choice). trparky You may not blame the apps because you know better but most people don't understand that, most people see a crashing app and suddenly you see, as the developer, a ton of comments saying that your app sucks. h4rr4r Please do tell us about your apps so we can be sure to avoid them on any devices we have not yet rooted. marcusmarcus2 His disqus profile leads to this website http://artflowstudio.com/ which has a few apps listed. Art oriented apps. There is only 1 update on that website since 2014, so I don't think I would be to concerned about installing one of his apps. Jordan Palmer Nice detective work. Adrian I can see a lot of refund requests coming from people who paid for apps and suddenly are told "Nope. Not for you anymore." A lot of us are rooted and buy apps and you'd better believe noise will be made if an app I use daily, that I paid for, suddenly breaks with an update because it's no longer blessed by the dev to run on my device. It's your app and you can do what you want with it, but there is always another side to the coin. BAlGaInTl That's not the way that Netflix worked it, and I doubt other developers of paid apps would either. I have a OnePlus One, that I run Lineage OS on since the original Cyanogen OS is now defunct and does not receive any updates. Netflix simply doesn't update to v 5+. It still works just fine. I may not get the newest and latest features, but part of that is on me for using a device that is dated. I'm not one of those users who, because I paid for an app once, fells that I should get all of the updates from now until the end of time. That isn't sustainable for developers. It could very well be that Netflix has some new features/offerings in the works in which they are getting pressure from outside sources to push this. A lot of valid reasons for a developer to enable the check exist. As long as they do it in the same manner that Netflix has, I don't see the issue. Adrian And just like Pokemon Go, eventually you'll get a message that you need to upgrade to the latest version or the app won't work, you know, that new version that won't let you actually log into it anymore. We've already seen this happen so let's not pretend that it isn't the next logical step. They aren't going to keep letting people sign in indefinitely with an app that doesn't have the security level they want. It's naive to think that hey I can just stick with the last version that works for root. It takes all of what, the time it takes to create a switch that says minimum version required to log in is "DRM version" BAlGaInTl Good Point. I recognize that. But it seems that the blame (in general) is being directed at Google in many of these posts. If that scenario happens, it isn't Google that blocked you from accessing Netflix. The need for this level of security is on the increase. The same users demanding better security and longer updates are the first ones to cry foul when Google starts laying the groundwork for exactly what they have asked for. Adrian I think there is a way to do both that doesn't piss off a very active community that helped take Android from a very very very ugly, second class OS to what we have now. I know a lot of us remember just how crippled Android was and it was the root/mod community that produced the bulk of what is now standard on Android. There needs to be a way to secure the devices AND not turn their back on the developer community that contributes. The idea, in Netflix's case, that root = pirate is insane. Why in the world would someone prefer to rip content on their phone to say a computer or XBox that is never going to move and can do it while you get on with your life? They're doing something for the sake of saying they're doing something, but if they think it's going to make a dent in piracy they, and the studios are nuts. I watch a lot of Netflix and still prefer to buy discs. People who do things the right way and are perfectly happy paying for content shouldn't have to jump through hoops to watch it. Those of us who root usually have a handful of things that stock Android is not doing for us. It's why we root. If all of these things were available in stock, my reasons for rooting would disappear but I don't see that happening any time soon. I think Android is getting so much better but if they make it exactly like iOS, might as well go to the dark side because Apple's apps tend to be more polished, come out first and OS updates are frequent. Don't bite the hand that feeds you just because you're getting more popular. BAlGaInTl I think that Netflix is a good example. It is HIGHLY likely that the reason for recent unpopular changes (see also VPN blocking) are being driven by other entities. It isn't that Netflix thinks its a problem, but the people that control a large portion of their content do. root pirate but it does introduce a security risk. I don't see how Google is turning their backs on developers. Developers are free to develop as they see fit and choose (at least for the moment) whether or not they will implement the SafetyNet check. The inherent problem is that a circumvented security is still circumvented and can no longer be considered secure. I can clearly see why some apps would and should frown upon that. Maybe not Netflix and Mario (IMHO), but certainly something like bank and payment apps. I don't think the inherent open nature of android will ever reduce to the level of iOS. But some changes have to occur to meet the needs/desire of the majority. Security is inherently difficult. The easier and more flexible you try to make it, the less secure it becomes. Adrian I do think banking apps should run in a secure space. Completely agree with that, but I disagree with root = less secure. My nexus devices stopped getting OS and security updates. Nothing. VERY insecure and dangerous. I rooted them, updated the OS with images from XDA developers and my devices that were once easy targets are more secure. There is always two sides to it. I see that Google is finally trying to take security seriously on Android and doing things in layers that completely cut out the vendor AND the carriers is the right step. Right now, Root is the only way to update a perfectly good device like my Nexus tablet tablet that the vendor said "oh well" to. Until Google has a REAL strategy in place to keep ALL Android devices secure, root will be necessary. Not everyone wants to or can upgrade devices every two years because they get abandoned. My father doesn't need an S8. He does need a device that gets security updates for more than a year after purchasing his phone. BAlGaInTl You are exactly correct, and I'm in the same situation with my OnePlus One. But in working to increase your security level, you leave holes behind. The key words that you used are "more secure." I agree. You are "more secure." But still (probably) less secure than a device that has been thoroughly tested, certified, and passes SafetyNet without hacks. Google has been open that they are working on security updates. They have improved significantly over the last couple years in getting those out. I feel that they are putting in place a real strategy to keep Android devices secure. This is part of that groundwork. I also feel that they are actively looking to replace Android in it's current state, and I can't say I blame them. The only real strategy may be to take lessons learned and start over. Lucky for them, they have the resources to do so. trparky > take lessons learned and start over Pretty much. The worst thing that they did from the very beginning was to allow for the OEMs to do what they wished. Google essentially made a deal with the devil when they released Android to the world. They wrote no requirements into the Android agreements that the OEMs agreed to to require updates to be a necessary thing. Big mistake Google. BAlGaInTl The really needed to in order to get their foot in the door of the market. If it would not have been open source from the beginning, none of the major manufactures would have bought off on it. The fact that they could use it for free (essentially) and still be able to customize on top of it is what sold it. trparky And now look at it, Android is a fucking mess of non-updated insecure devices that are ripe for anyone to be able to take over and turn into a botnet. trparky And you should be raising holy hell with the OEM that made that device! Just because your device is old doesn't mean that it shouldn't still be supported. Windows 7 is nearly eight years old and it still receives Windows Updates. Why can't your device? BAlGaInTl Normally, I would agree, but the OnePlus One is a special case. The OEM operating system is the now defunct Cyanogen OS. I had to balance having the original OS without updates, or running another with updates. The phone is now almost three years old. If I bought a PC with Windows on it three years ago, and Microsoft had since gone out of business, should the PC manufacturer be responsible for providing Windows 7 updates? Even though the PC is beyond it's support date? Sure, I can increase the security by switching to another OS that is updated. It may even be a Windows clone. But if a software developer decided to only support "original, unmodified" PC configurations, that would be within their right. trparky But it can be adapted to run LineageOS. Sudev There is bit difference in analogy here: OnePlus manufactured the phone and Cynogen Inc customized AOSP Android OS for it, they didn't developed it from ground up. I understand that Cynogen INC is out of business now too. However in PC world, it would be the case that you purchased a PC from Dell and get Microsoft Windows OS with some additional Dell software. If Dell or developer of that custom software goes out of business you still get OS update for your PC. Its not android OS itself out business here. Adrian and for the record, I absolutely agree that it was the content providers and not all on Netflix. trparky You should be demanding that OnePlus send an official update to your device. So what if your device is old? It should be still supported. Windows 7 is still supported nearly eight years later, why can't your device be supported for that long as well? Plumplam Who cares except for a bunch of XDA nerds? If it means better security then I'm all for it. Dmitri Smirnov Well, for starters, it doesn't mean better security, since it does nothing to address the problems with vulnerable outdated android versions that will be "certified", but will allow malicious apps to quietly escalate their privileges and do their dirty work, but will block "uncertified" custom roms that actually have all the recent secuirity patches and give user full control over who has root access and how. Also, "bunch of XDA nerds" are the source of a lot of features that had their trial run in custom ROMs and then were adopted to the AOSP. Should I remind you of "The Oak and the Pig" fable? Alienate the developers bringing new ideas to the ecosystem - lose the competetive edge you had over other OSes saf1927 Actually, custom ROMs never really have the latest security patches despite what they claim since kernels aren't maintained and no proprietary blobs is updated anymore. If ROM developers were OEMs, they'd be violating their agreements with Google by bumping the patch level without actually addressing all the vulnerabilities. Dmitri Smirnov Well they patch the AOSP to the same level as latest official one and kernel - if it's possible to do so without breaking the compatibility with compiled blobs or at least on the level of latest official firmware. So in the end run it's at least as secure as the official firmware, often - much more so. saf1927 If you look at the security bulletin, most vulnerabilities come from proprietary drivers and require these to be updated. On a supported device, these are provided by the chip manufacturers to the OEMs, on an unsupported device they aren't updated anymore. A custom ROM can only fix userspace security issues. In the end, bumping the patch level without addressing all vulnerabilities in that patch gives a false sense of security to users. Dmitri Smirnov If anything, this is an argument for forcing OEMs to opensource their blobs. For some reason community is much better at releasing the fixes for what they can change (userspace), while OEMs generally stop caring as soon as device is out the door. saf1927 The problem goes beyond OEMs unfortunately. All the phones you can buy are assembled with off-the-shelf components that they buy from other manufacturers and it is them that provide the binary blobs to the OEMs. If they stop supporting components, the OEMs can't do anything. For the chip, it's companies like Qualcomm, Samsung, Mediatek etc. that need to support it with up-to-date drivers. Once they stop, the life-cycle of a phone comes to an end. trparky And that is probably one of many reason why Qualcomm is facing a nice fat anti-trust lawsuit. Serves them right. trparky That ain't ever going to happen. There's no way they're going to allow for their intellectual property to be open for all the world to see and have it cracked open. It would be corporate suicide since their competitors would be able to reverse engineer their stuff. Suicide_Note Never heard of "The Oak and the Pig" before. Could you tell me more? Seriously. Dmitri Smirnov http://www.aliceswonderland.eu/Alice-ska350-en.html Maxr1998 Ah, Lessing. Going to read the original version in a minute :) username_not_valid Thats a very generous view of the custom ROM community. It might be true of a few, very few devs, but most ROMs are unsupported garbage with serious security issues. Dmitri Smirnov Maybe so, but out of this cesspool of garbage CyanogenMod was born, which became LineageOS. I'd say their quality standard appeals me more than a lot of OEMs. username_not_valid Cyanogen and Lineage was what i had in mind.. Each to his own i guess. BAlGaInTl Yes and no. I run Lineage on my OnePlus One because Cyanogen OS is no longer supported. I can say with certainty that Lineage introduces stability issues that I have to deal with to be up to date. Wilton Daniel Pinto Ninna pooty bewarci Qwip Consider the bigger picture. Right now, users are being shuffled into a situation where they must restrict the control they have over their device if they want to be able to use Netflix (and presumably banking apps will follow soon). That may seem fine, and from some security perspective it is probably a good thing. How much control do you have over your _laptop_? How much do you want? Right now, we're blissfully able to install unsigned software on our computers (although various OSs will complain about it), but will that last? How long will it be before we can only open our banking interface on our laptop using a trusted, digitally signed browser on a machine that is using secure boot and can only run signed binaries? I can understand the direction that Netflix (and others) are coming from, and to them it may even make sense. The question is: what is the cost of ceding control over our devices/machines in order to be able to watch netflix, etc. trparky Yeah and that's why Windows is the virus filled cesspool that it is today. Windows 10 is slowly changing Windows to be an app store based ecosystem in which all apps will be sandboxed. It's coming to the desktop near you. saf1927 I hope Magisk (or other similar mods in the future) keep working, so to prevent this. Not a problem on my Pixel XL since I haven't rooted it, but on my Nexus 5 Magisk allows it to pass Safety Net even though it's running a custom ROM (7.1.2) and it's rooted. Hendrik Leppkes SafetyNets primary purpose is to secure devices for Android Pay, and when you deal with actual money transactions on your device, you really don't want any hack interfering with it - so I'm quite certain they'll do whatever they can to break hacks like this and ensure the security and integrity of the device. h4rr4r No, its primary purpose is to make the device trustworthy for others not the person who paid for it. This is how it makes it "secure" for android pay. You are a possible threat and this closes that. Suicide_Note It would seem that Google is erecting a wall around their garden, too. EowynCarter While Apple opens iOS more and more. YouNex According to the support/help page, a device is not certified if it stops getting Android updates. How fuck up is that ? I don't get it. My Moto X has always been on stock ROM, yet it's showing up as non certified. Yes it's rooted + system modifications, but at no point is it stated that root prevents it from being certified. Suicide_Note Really? You can't understand why your rooted/system modified device is non-certified? YouNex I know how to read, but this is vague https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/b6f710b8628f0e09ab73ba144c133a2c9b1fe1325b353ae7dc1636f2776b2ac0.png "Not secure" jonzey231 Root and/or unlocked bootloader = Not certified. YouNex It says nothing about root or bootloader https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/b6f710b8628f0e09ab73ba144c133a2c9b1fe1325b353ae7dc1636f2776b2ac0.png ast00 Can't wait until LastPass excludes root users... Fuck them. Adonis K. If they do, I'm cancelling my subscription... Naxx ENVY Fuck them and yet they haven't done anything yet ... #internetlogic Also i know right , crazy for a company that stores your passwords to make themselves more secure . ABSOLUTE CRAZY , RAGE RAGE RAGE Jordan Palmer I don't understand your reasoning or rationale for these two statements. ast00 The second part is related to Google. Sorry about the confusion. Believe it or not, most of us root users keep SELinux in it's Enforcing state. This means we are safe. Nothing gets root rights without us knowing. Our phones are just as safe if not safer than most stock phones. JATIN BANSAL SafetyNet test can be passed using Magisk Manager. I am using it and it works fine for me. Even in play store, my device is certified. May be this helps someone. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/3756499ff5876545740cd0e88e38961bb2c327d90fc43f5801f4bce5d802c990.png https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/44185f640490cb506a68a3414579bd345123f7d52ee2e11802d31d5141db11ae.png Nick Most people are worried about the future when the exploits that Magisk uses are patched and it continues to make it harder for people to get around this. JATIN BANSAL That's what I am also worried about. I just posted this for those who are already rooted and for now want to keep the root. My main purpose of rooting was to flash lineage OS. I think custom rom is the only way of staying updated to latest version of Android as google itself doesn't update their phones after 2 years (18 months I think) for reasons they have. I think if someone buys a flagship device which costs 700$+, it should have 3-4 years of full software update support. 😆😄 2 years of major OS version updates and 3 years of security patches. After 3 years, its time to buy a new phone cuz its so old anyway. trparky Says you! Windows 7 was released on July 22, 2009 and they still support it EIGHT YEARS LATER! And they plan on supporting it until the year 2020 which means it will be supported for a total of ELEVEN YEARS! If Microsoft can do it, Google can too!!! Does Microsoft suddenly say "Your machine is too old, go buy a new one"? No, they continue to give you Windows Updates for years later. We should also be demanding that the Android OEMs do so as well. A Samsung Note 5 has more than enough hardware in it to run Android 7 but no... we can't do that, we need to make money so we don't update them to force you to buy a new device. Lambdadelta Magisk...alright, thanks for the tip-off. I really must get it. TadMSTR Magisk doesn't always pass SafetyNet. I have some devices it fails on. However, several other devices it works just fine. Make sure you turn on the hide root option, it's off by default. Lambdadelta Well, I do have a problem, and that is my device is not able to download it directly from Google Play, so I have to get the APK from XDA. I dunno why this is the case for my phone though. Is it because it's a 4.4.4? Either way, I'll get the APK moved to my phone later tonight. Teodor Axel Johan Jönsson I have activated hide root option, and it passes SafetyNet, but in Google Play Store, it still shows uncertified. What app should I hide root from to get Play Store to show Certified? JATIN BANSAL As per XDA: Q: Safety Net fails after enabling MagiskHide A: Magisk can only hide Magisk core features, for Magisk modules it depends on what the module does. If your ROM itself is not able to pass SafetyNet, then there is nothing Magisk can help. Your best bet is 100% stock ROMs, because your phone manufacturer is forced to release a device passing CTS. Teodor Axel Johan Jönsson What in Magisk Hide did you check/how did you do it? Google Play Store? Or Play services? Because here it says uncertified :( JATIN BANSAL Just clear app data of play store. Now it will show your device certified Teodor Axel Johan Jönsson Thanks! Muzaffar I believe that root and custom rom makes android what it is now. This feels like betrayal for Android enthusiast. username_not_valid Well maybe in the very early days (maybe), but not any more. Rooted phones make up a tiny fraction of active devices. Muzaffar It's not about active devices. It's about how android develop together with community (well as i remember) I believe that those "rooted user" contribute many things that make android right now. I still remember status bar (and nav bar) color change was implemented on Kitkat before it becomes official on lollipop. Also, we can't forget how badly mobile active network bug happens in lollipop if it's not those "rooted user" who found out the fix via xposed. and i believe there are still more. trparky We can blame the OEMs for that kind of stuff because of things like locked bootloaders, eFuses, etc. username_not_valid Or we can blame ROM makers for it because they kept breaking the devices causing warranty claims. Naxx ENVY no offence but that's small thinking ... i'd say 90% of people on Android devices don't want or even know about root, heck it may even be 95% ... security is more of a concern, sure it annoys us geeks, but that's the 5% at most. Muzaffar And about half of android devices is left outdated. Not to mention bugs that unsolved on previous android. I'll pick a dumb phone instead, if android becomes a closed platform. trparky And truth be told that's why I have an iPhone. I simply got sick and tired of the lack of updates so I told myself I'm going to the iPhone and have been happy ever since. OK sure, it may not have all of the customization features that Android has but I can be guaranteed that I will get software and security updates on time, every time, regardless of my carrier of choice. refthemc I think you misread his comment, he's saying that root and custom roms got Android to where it is TODAY not saying that it is necessary TODAY. And I agree. trparky It pretty much comes down to this. Google is simply targeting a much larger piece of the pie. You can't blame them for trying to do what is necessary to protect not only the platform but the Android brand itself. Qwip Well, it isn't like there is anywhere else to go though, is it? Google can basically throw enthusiasts who have promoted and fostered android development under the bus - they don't need them any more. trparky Money trumps community. Always has, always will. username_not_valid Ad blocking was the last holdout reason to root for me, but even thats no longer a good reason with things like Adhell, Adguard etc I have no other reason to root now, custom ROMs are generally garbage, and bloat can usually be uninstalled or disabled, so its just not needed. Adonis K. custom ROMs have nothing to do with root... thevigilante Custom ROMs have uncertified flag in Play Store Mike Avellanosa Not all, though George Byers My Nexus 7 2013 is passing safteynet running Lineage unrooted. Wilton Daniel Pinto Let me guess, you have a Pixel. Or you wouldn't call custom ROMs bloated while the reality is other way round username_not_valid Wouldn't touch a Pixel actually. username_not_valid Should be noted that I didn't call custom ROMs bloated, I guess you misread it. Wilton Daniel Pinto Oh yeah, I misread it . My bad Zach Mauch This is going to cause the same problem I see in governments work with security. They will blindly block things like root and bootloader unlock regardless of if it poses any credible threat because it FEELS more secure. Blah!!!!!! Naxx ENVY it IS more secure, not just " feels" h4rr4r More secure for them, not for me the owner of the device. Besides, not even for them in the long term. An up to date ROM has many exploits patched that a two versions out of date and 12 months behind on security patches OTA has. Zach Mauch What I mean is they will apply restrictions because they easily can and it gives a warm fuzzy for them. They will do this regardless of the impact to the user. The analogy here is that in my job I am constantly unnecessary restrictions and bureaucracy that make doing my job much more difficult. For instance, we are disallowed from using remote desktop on standalone computer networks. It would make our job MUCH MUCH easier in many circumstances and save money on software as I could remote into my PC from anywhere in the building. Yet they deny us that and claim security. jonzey231 So this will force people to install apps from unauthorized sources, thus making the whole Android malware issue that much more prevalent. Great.. Suicide_Note Unless being held at gunpoint, no one is forced to install apps from unauthorized sources. That's a user's CHOICE. jonzey231 You know what I mean. Stop playing devil's advocate on everyone's posts. Eric Braun He's not incorrect. Kyle R Krcmaric "Stop providing an alternate viewpoint to my own." It's just comments. Anyway, I think Google also announced that even sideloaded apps will get scanned by their new Google Play Protect service, which may help nullify the risk of sideloading in the first place. d0x360 That's not an alternate viewpoint unless your view is "don't install any apps ever" There is no logical argument to defend this move by Google. None. username_not_valid Yes there is. Come content creators will not allow a provider to support a rooted or otherwise compromised device. Right or wrong in your eyes thats the reality, and in order for Android to be able to have such services Google have to do this. d0x360 What you said isn't an alternate viewpoint lol you are just repeating the reason Google is doing this which everyone agrees is a fact. As for this new comment...a rooted phone isn't compromised. Tell me...what would a rooted user do with Netflix that would make Netflix want to block them? Are they worried about people copying movies because if they think Android is the vector for that action they are idiots. All they are doing is making a problem by allowing bad actors to inject malware into a Netflix apk that could be installed by both root and unrooted users. Genius! Give me 1 good reason to block rooted phones from an app like oh I dunno, Mario run or whatever it's called. Any answers you give are false. Wanna know why? Hacked apks exist to allow cheating and they can be installed by anyone rooted or not. In fact I'd stake my life that your average unrooted user is installing more modified apk files to cheat in games or whatever than any rooted user. People who root are generally better educated about the Android eco system and do less dumb stuff. As for Netflix I cancelled my account on the day they did this and now I just use a friends account so they lost a subscriber due to this move and I rarely ever used the app. Sure 1 person closing an account that's existed since the day they opened isn't going to do much but I vote with my wallet and if a company does something I dislike then they simply don't get my money. The first person I asked gave me their login info and I made a profile. It's just like how I share my HBO subscription with someone else. Easy easy. username_not_valid See my previous comment. Its not for me to argue, the fact is content providers want it, fair or not, end of story, therefore its going to happen. The tiny number of rooters out there are meaningless to them, and Google. Netflix has to do this because the providers of its non-original content demand it. Its not Netflix fault, they either do it or lose shows. Losing large amounts of their content would affect their subscription base several orders of magnitude more than losing rooted users, who chances are, use the service on more than their phone or tablet anyway. d0x360 Once again I ask... what about a rooted device is dangerous to an app and also this is now a second question, what makes it compromised? BAlGaInTl Clearly you've made up your mind on the issue, but I'll give it a go. It isn't necessarily the root that is dangerous to an app or vice versa. The compromise comes from other apps/processes that can take advantage of root. If you don't understand that, then you don't understand what root really is. It has a lot of valuable uses, but it can also be dangerous. To address your previous statement, just because it rubs me the wrong way. So your "solution" was to cancel your Netflix account and then steal the content? So clearly, you aren't "actually" affected by the change, because you can still watch Netflix. You do realize that watching their content is also valuable to them and makes them money? If you want to boycott Netflix for their practices, then by all means do. Otherwise, it just comes across as hypocritical IMHO. d0x360 I don't believe I asked you. No I'm not stealing Netflix content, it's being paid for and Netflix has many times in the past encouraged account sharing. Of course they did so in the hopes you would join but they still allow it. I paid my Netflix dues. Day 1 4 disc member, then as soon as it was available I upgraded to the 4k 4 user package. It's not piracy either, I'm not recording or distributing the content. If Netflix wants to dick with me I'll dick with them. I never said this was permanent but I vote with my wallet. Vote cast. I also haven't used Netflix once since that day despite being able to. I've been using Amazon and Microsoft video where I own over 500 movies so you can stuff the whole theft argument. I've bought more content than most and that doesn't include my DVD, Blu-ray, and uhd Blu-ray collection which is well over 1400 movies and TV shows at this point. Your right...I've been rooting since the first Android phone but I totally don't understand the possibilities. My argument is simple. The overwhelming majority of root users don't mess with apps. To hell with that nonsense argument anyways. What is the danger to Netflix? Copying movies? Please...it's a million times easier to do it on a PC. Even windows xp can handle it without issue. Does Netflix and you I suppose really think root users are using the app to steal content? If so how? Show me one forum topic, one article, one modified Netflix apk that allows downloading and bypassing their drm. I'm begging you. Just 1. BAlGaInTl I reviewed the Netflix TOS, and I will agree that you are not stealing. I'll even remove the verbiage from my post. Netflix does not make any such stipulation. They speak only of the "Account Owner" and "Devices." I guess I just assumed that, and that's my bad. As I've said in other posts... It isn't all about Netflix. A large part of it is about their content. They really can't argue that point with providers. You either play by their rules, work to establish new rules, or choose not to carry them. Netflix wants to stay relevant on all platforms. That's the main danger to Netflix. In addition, I shouldn't have to give an example in the wild of an exploit. Just because it is difficult to find doesn't mean it doesn't exist. What if someone else writes an app that uses root to mine user account data from Netflix? Should Netflix not be worried about protecting user data? If that happens, who is responsible for the security and the bad press? Probably not Netflix, but they would certainly be impacted. I checked my app really quick (which is stuck on version 4 because I'm affected). Since Netflix keeps you logged in for convenience (that's spelled out in their terms), a quick look gives my full name, username, phone number, zip code, the brand of payment card, and the last 4 digits of that card. That's quite a bit of information that can easily be gathered by a piece of Malware. Now as I said... Netflix probably wouldn't be liable if a user was compromised because of root. It would certainly be a danger to their business however. Why should the be asked to take that risk? It seems to me that they are approaching this in a realistic manner, and rolling it out in a reasonable way. Would this affect the majority of root users? Probably not. By their nature, root users will find ways around it anyway. The problem is that the impact to Netflix from losing content and/or a compromised app is disproportionate the loss of blocking root users. It's simply a numbers game, and you can't blame Netflix for that. And you certainly can't blame Google who is trying to improve security. username_not_valid Thats not for me to decide, or argue, the fact is the content providers have decided that rooting is a risk to their copyrighted content, and as such services like Netflix, Amazon, and other streaming services must comply and lock out rooted devices. Passing safetynet and using Googles DRM framework is the easiest way to claim due diligence, so thats what they will do, and in order to keep Android competitive Google is providing the tools needed to make it possible. What I will argue though is that your notion that custom ROMs etc are more secure is unfounded. The best might well be, but there are hundreds of completely random and unchecked ROMs out there that could contain absolutely anything, you cant possibly claim that custom ROMs are inherently safer or more secure than OEM ROMs, outdated or not. jonzey231 So let's play this out: If someone takes the Netflix .apk and mods it with malware and then signs it, it will pass installation on the device. 1. User opens app. 2. App does whatever shitty thing it's designed to do while the user thinks they just got around the block. 3. The OS scans the app and warns the user it's been modified and they should uninstall it. 4. User thinks "Ha! I know and that's why it works!" 5. User keeps app until they get a call from Credit Karma that their identity was probably stolen but they don't know how. 6. Person spends 6 months fixing stolen identity. But still uses that app the whole time. Ultimately, that user is still going to be screwed. Would you or I make this mistake? No. Would your cousin's friend's dad because he had his son root so he could tether for free and overheard you guys talking about sideloading apps and googled how to do it? Yes. Randroid Problem is, even in your scenario, root has nothing to do with it. Someone who is not rooted could do the same thing. The only problem is, now MORE people who root are going to be *forced* to look for a modified apk because the official apk is not available from the Play Store. So in the end, it's causing more problems than it's fixing. Corbin Baxter Here's the thing about rooting: when you alter your devices software like that, then Google shouldn't be responsible for anything that comes afterwards for the user. This just helps discourage rooting, which can alter a new users perspective on Android, or make someone reconsider getting an Android device. someone755 For what it's worth, back in 2011/2010, many of us bought into Android *because* we could root. Imagine the possibilities of being in control of so much more of your system than with any mobile OS prior; We've spent hundreds (some, thousands) of dollars in this environment, on devices, apps, books etc. I understand this isn't how things stand nowadays, but root is still prevalent because of one issue that Google will not fix (or at least, won't until O+ is running on the majority of devices, but that'll take two years at the minimum), and those are updates and vendor apps (i.e. bloatware). If my phone is stuck on Lollipop I'm going to root it; I'll be able to mitigate the memory leak performance drops, and overall customize the device to fit my specific needs -- I've made quite a few friends (think ROM and kernel devs) because I just wanted to put a thermal engine better than Qualcomm's horrendous MPDecision into the kernel directly (i.e. I took the kernel source and modified it to fit my needs). What Google is trying to do here is, yes, discourage rooting, but instead of fixing the root cause (heh) behind why people root in the first place (that is, again, customizability and personal(ized) performance tuning, in large part to keep devices on older Android versions alive), root wouldn't be necessary. In the long run this *might* fix the symptom, but it most definitely will not help in fixing the cause. And that's because the cause is Google itself. As if apps like Snapchat blocking power users from their apps wasn't enough, now there's this -- If it becomes so common that even Google's own apps start to utilize the feature, I'll be gone to another mobile platform within a month. That might mean iOS, it might mean S60v3, I'll know that if (or rather, when) it happens. tl;dr: Google is putting a band-aid on a shotgun wound. Corbin Baxter I'm speaking mainly for new Android users. They don't feel as comfortable rooting. Doing this makes Android SEEM more like iOS. This doesn't MAKE Android like iOS. New users are comfortable with that. This is the same issue Microsoft had with Windows 8/8.1. Classic users, and Windows enthusiasts, hated someone changing the way they would use their computers. Microsoft introduced a different way of doing things, and to enthusiasts, it was bad, no matter how good it might be. Google's Project Treble should mostly fix the fragmentation problem, therefore giving Android users one less reason to root. To us enthusiasts, nothing can beat rooting, but it might not be the best solution to the problems Android has. Google seems intent on fixing the problems rooting tries to solve, but in a higher-quality and reliable way. No hard feelings😉 trparky They won't understand that, they're too blinded by their geek rose colored glasses. Corbin Baxter I don't expect everyone to understand, but I'll be happy if even a small handful understand what Google is doing here. Dmitri Smirnov > when you alter your devices software like that, then Google shouldn't be responsible for anything that comes afterwards for the user. As if right now Google or the OEMs are in any ways responsible for the malware or unpatched firmware vulnerabilities that stay this way for year. But yes, the users that root are the problem. Corbin Baxter For unrooted phones, yes Google and OEMs are very responsible. But after you root, Android loses most of its security and stability, and rooting is basically tinkering with core system files. Google doesn't have any control over what the user can or can't do after that. bekifft That wasn't even a devil's advocate, that was a straight up strawman. Frosted Butts Yes.. please tell me about all the Netflix alternatives i can install, that can legally stream from Netflix...... Right now, if i am rooted and want Netflix (a service i am paying for), i must go through 3rd party app stores to install the APK. There is no choice at all... R Firestone ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ Umm you have the choice to unroot your device. Maxr1998 ..which is a bad choice for many. d0x360 Yes you do except I rooted my device to make it MORE secure. Unrooting would make my device less secure than sideloading apps would. username_not_valid People can keep saying that, but the content providers have no way to know whether or not you have taken measures to secure your custom device, whereas if they go down this root they know its handled. BAlGaInTl "whereas if they go down this root they know its handled" I see what you did there. 😆😄 ...or just watch Netflix from Chrome! You could even do this from a Linux box with root! 😃 Suicide_Note Sure there is: unroot. Problem solved. neoKushan "I've solved this problem by creating 3 more problems - but it IS solved!" Eric Braun https://www.amazon.com/Netflix-Inc/dp/B005ZXWMUS Option C .. ?? h4rr4r A choice that is now more popular. dcdttu It's not so much about what a user chooses to do. It's about probability. The probability that sites are going to try to lure users into downloading malware-infected Netflix APKs from 3rd party sites is going to go up if you can't download it from a safe source in the first place. This is just like the fact that, if you don't give drug users a safe and clean place to shoot up, they're going to go do it somewhere else that's much more dangerous. Both of these scenarios are bad for society in general, no matter what the original intention was. kgptzac 1/10. Gotta try harder. Premsuraj How? Google Play Protect will still catch malicious apps makapav Yes but you're potentially making people venture through shady sites to get the APKs. Eric Braun Or to Amazons App store or Fdroid. The people going to shady sites are already going there, this isn't going to increase the traffic by any real amount. tehboogieman Are you sure that Google will continue allowing GPP for unlocked or rooted users going forward? Not to mention that it's not a silver bullet for 0days d0x360 It barely works as is. There are tons of apps that slip through every day. Krebs on security reports on them quite frequently. I don't trust Google's scanning of apps at all which is why I root. I can make my phone more secure and I can also image the device as often as I want so if something does happen it's fixed within 5 min. If I unroot then I lose the protection along with the backups. Premsuraj Custom ROMs and root can't protect from 0days either. And just out of curiosity how is root going to provide more security? If anything it makes the device less secure tehboogieman Nobody said root makes a device more secure. Blocking root users from downloading apps from the Play Store puts users at more risk since those users will be more inclined to sideload apps from sources that might not be as reliable as the Play Store. Premsuraj The only people who cares about this are the people who root. And those user's generally tend to be more knowledgeable about what kind of apps and app stores they can trust. ASYOUTHIA✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ And only <2% of users will do this to keep rooted. xxTheGoDxx Only the plus 50 - 100 Million users that have root: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=eu.chainfire.supersu ASYOUTHIA✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ You do realize that that's just downloads right? ...not active users. blindexecutioner I'm not mad. I continue to use things like magisk to help get around stuff like this. All this will do is encourage me to use unauthorized sources for offending apps if magisk ever stops working. There is a reason I use Android over iOS and it certainly isn't because the apps are better designed or whatever. brian. Magisk is a good way around this. However, I don't know how long this will last. I would think with security in mind and developers trying to monetize more, it will put pressure on Google to make SafetyNet get triggered much easier. Obviously, I don't have any way of knowing, but this could easily turn into a cat and mouse game more than it already is. Android Pay was first, other apps did it like Super Mario Run, which who cares, but now Netflix? Changes are coming, and it doesn't look good for the rooting community. D13H4RD2L1V3 I'm not sure if everyone gets why some of us went through the trouble of gaining SU access. Sure, maybe there's a few who went through all that trouble for nefarious purposes (and maybe that got regulatory bodies concerned to the point where Google even needed to consider this) but from my perspective at least, a lot of us gain Superuser access mainly to get features that we liked on other Android flavors, especially in the case of a build of Android that's very close to Google's vision. Such as the ability to hide the navbar at any time we wanted and also to gain theming support (which I feel should be added officially sooner rather than later because I absolutely hate how Google is making their already-bright UI even more eye-searing with even more white-colored elements, which also makes the benefits of OLED much less obvious). I wouldn't be as concerned if these features were pushed to AOSP soon, but as it stands, I feel that Google should probably think about making these features available soon. Marty Thank the bad apples for why you no longer have freedom. Jeremy ディリマ Would changing region firmware with Odin flag the SafetyNet check on Samsung mobiles? Soz if it's a stupid question a lot has changed since I last fiddled with Android Christopher Robert This was a long time coming. Once root user started using root to pirate software, and/or get around geo locks, instead of using it to add feature to their firmware or improve their devices performance, it was only a matter of time before it all got torn down. h4rr4r Get around geo locks? You mean have my device report the location I want it to report? Yeah, how terrible that I control what my computer does. dizel123 You still do. This doesn't affect that at all h4rr4r You said the justification for that was people using their devices for their own reasons in the way they liked. I was pointing out that this is a normal thing and not something that should be punished. Cuvis You don't need root to pirate. You never did. Marty Apple says, Thank you. h4rr4r Sounds like we need a new FREE platform. Maybe Amazon can use this to push their store. mxwp but will the Netflix from the Amazon App Store work on rooted phones? Curt RIP Root. I'm not moving from stock anymore, just cab with the hassle. Until there's a 'reliable' way to hide from Safety Net, I'll enjoy my Android Pay, banking apps and overall smoothness. (If it was up to me, I'd be rooted with Linage) h4rr4r IOS is the platform for you. That was the deal from the beginning. hp-fourtwenty magisk....giyf .y phone is rooted with lineage 14.1, and passes safetynet. problem solved! jcopernicus Fantastic news. Lawstorant All this butthurt for what? You all sound like Magisk doesn't exist. Dave Hamilton Lets take Apple and there closed source. Lets take Google and there open source, the freedom to do and change as you please to make the device yours. No two devices have to be the same. Lets get 115 million android users, and then start deciding you no longer have this choice and freedom to do what you want! When something gets better and better, its only a matter of time before all the things you love are removed and comersilised Eric Braun You still have the option to do what you want. However like everything there are reactions for every action. Want to root or unlock your device? Sure, however there may be a few apps that no longer appear in the playstore. May want to have a backup like Amazon App Store or something similar ready. No one is stopping you, feel free to do as you please. tehboogieman Man, if I have to choose between having a device with root or a device with apps that use day to day, the iPhone goes from a 1% chance of being my daily driver to about 50% There are still a lot that can Android can do that iOS can't, but if I'm living in a walled garden the iPhone is looking pretty attractive. 5+ years of official OS support, solid retail network for quick service or hardware exchanges. The Play Store is my main source of apps that I know are vetted and generally safe. I have no desire to manage app updates manually. There is always a chance that someone will build and maintain an appstore that will have all root blocked apps (maybe the future of APKMirror?). If not it might be the death of Android for users like me Eric Braun Even without all of this I would use an APKMirror App that allowed for updating of apps automatically. dizel123 Google gives app developers more control over their apps. Whiny entitled internet crybabies go on the internet and whine and cry. Aka...Thursday neoKushan Alternatively: Google restricts users from using their device, which they own, how they see fit. dizel123 Except Google isn't restricting anyone from doing anything. But being 100% wrong has never stopped anyone in the internet NubCake being an asshole (in your case) hasn't stopped anyone from commenting eather it seems. dizel123 I can admit to being an asshole. But I'm also right so it's all good. neoKushan It's certainly not stopping you. dizel123 I haven't experienced it so of course it's not stopping me trparky You may own the hardware but you don't own the software, you only have a license to use it. Csöpi Thats so greate. I have a stock oneplus one and for some strange reasons i was failing the test beforhand, but now its all green. Still cant update the netflix app hence chromecast isnt working either anymore. Not really happy. JC If there's a will there's a way. brian. If more developers get on board with this, I can't see why I would switch to Android. I've always been curious about new Android phones, bought a bunch and rooted them all if I could. This is not good for a person like me. d0x360 If Google keeps this up and app devs include the api to block rooted phones then my days using Android will be over and Google will have lost a user who's been there since the g1. I don't know what I'd switch to... probably windows mobile because I'm not a fan of apple whatsoever. It's really a shame because if I had to guess I'd say 99.99% of people who root do so for either the added security and or customized experiences. For example I use root to modify my status bar and quick panel as well as firewall my apps and use adaway and yes Google I do whitelist sites that aren't obnoxious with their ads. John Doe All the more reason for the APK mirror appstore LoL Jan-Lk Else Yeah Google want's us to buy tooooo expensive phones to just get the latest Android, because cheap phones suck at updates and so they need to be flashed and rooted... trparky But if the community raises holy hell with the OEMs then maybe it will be corrected. There's no damn reason why a three year old device can't be updated when an eight year old Windows 7 machine is still receiving Windows Updates. McStagger WHY DOES NETFLIX CARE IF THE PHONE IS ROOTED?!?!?!?! mxwp Netflix does not care, but the content creators that make the stuff you see on Netflix do care. They care because they are idiots who think it is easier to pirate from rooted phones. bekifft Again, Google becomes more and more restrictive. I switched from iPhone because the screens were too small, and Google was far less restrictive. Both of those issues are now resolved, and Google's upped the price of their device to match Apple. May as well switch back to iPhone, Google seems to support it just as much as Android anyway. Luxferro Except it's not just rooted users! Any device with an unlocked bootloader. hp-fourtwenty Your comment sucks for misinforming users about what safetynet is....has NOTHING to do with unlocked bootloaders. Luxferro Sure it does. My Nexus 6P only has an unlocked bootloader, and Netflix disappeared from the play store after the last update. And I'm not the only one, so I suggest you do some reading. TechGuy22 more reason for me to pirate hey, have at it Matías Duarte I hope Netflix does the same with Jailbroken iOS devices. Why they do this btw? To prevent people recording their movies? You can do that with Windows.. Knowledgeborn Allah In all honesty, that'll probably never happen. Jailbreaking iOS opens the doors to a lot of customization on an iPhone, but the security issues are often minimal (with the exception being not having the latest software version). Jailbreaking is pretty much filtered through the Cydia platform. You don't have access to the entire system with a jailbreak. Rooting is completely different, because you can completely reshape the core OS. fbl Note : I don't work for Netflix so I can't comment for them. Possible causes : - the right holders might be pushing for this. I work on roughly the same product area and we don't implement DRM because we like them, we implement them because we contractually have to. -Netflix is tired of getting low notes because of crashes coming by shitty hacks in custom roms. Zach Mauch Anyone know how chromebooks will be affected by this? Will dev mode being enabled cause you to fail SafetyNet Checks? That is currently the only way to install apks on Chromebooks. Branko But Android AOSP!11 -Google 2011 How the times how changed. Wayne Randall ALT arguement, because I don't have time to read every comment... This doesn't limit me and my rooted N6P at all, this move limits how much money they (the devs and Google) are going to make. I can't buy it (the app or coins, or special characters, or bonus content, w/e) if I can't see it. Plain and simple. The important apps will still be there. No app is worth unroot. Block Project Fi from root though... weeeellll. I guess I'd unroot for that. mxwp yeah, only Netflix, banks, and big names will use these blocks. i am guessing most devs want as much exposure as possible. PVL_93_RU Google is actively trying to kill the modding community. Not the Custom ROM makers, but people who root and install Xposed. All because they compromise the security for Android Pay I fear the day root and Xposed apps start disappearing from the Play Store trparky If it comes to security vs being open, security will always win (or at least should always win). Eric Koop I had my Shaw Gateway app update yesterday and they changed it so it doesn't work if rooted. So I had to uninstall and find an APK online of an older version. Now it's just a matter of time before I forget and re-install the update. What a pain... disqus_em5YfkbWdk Well this would certainly get me to cancel Netflix. My personal Plex server is far better than Netflix could ever be anyway. Vivek Rameses Becoming apple more and more every day. Disgusting. Knowledgeborn Allah Android is starting to look more and more like iOS with each update... ¯_(ツ)_/¯ trparky Open platforms rarely stay open once the Benjamins start rolling in. hp-fourtwenty Go ahead and block me...I'll just pirate your app. Play nice and so will I. Start poking me and I'll poke back by never giving you another penny. App devs can't beat XDA devs. It's not going to happen. My unlocked, rooted, rommed and modded device still passes safety net. The day that stops, so does the flow of money leaving my hands on the play store. Luxferro Lay off the sodas.... UniBroW Question, can those of you without access to Netflix on Google play, can it be installed from the Amazon App Store? Stanley C. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/dd381b7e8a39df74c4725712a0db906098c965e9ee4194b6e01e020fd69ee566.png Thats how magisk is made... Magic! Marti Abernathey Yawn. I've got a rooted device and just installed Netflix... because? Magisk. As soon as they made this choice I cancelled. Not because I can't get around it, but because they make me do that. mrjayviper even on a non-rooted LOS mis 5s+, I cannot install Netflix. unlocking the bootloader already tripped safety. And I don't want to root. The features available in non-rooted LOS is enough for me. Teh BuG No. Bueno. TedPhillips Sigh. What's the over-under on this becoming pervasive in the play store... MicroG / Fdroid I'm coming soon. World needs a solid single alternative gcm replacement to catch on. TedPhillips As far as the potential for support overhead, being rooted is generally less than the pain coming from the Xposed/magisk crowd. You need to be actively interfering with an app via root vs code being injected into low levels of the framework that everything uses. TedPhillips I think the best outcome could be that Google opens up their process for little guys to certify there own rom builds, ala let's encrypt lowering friction on getting ssl setup. AOSP should not be a functionally useless base implementation for I'm roms, but something you can use in​ practice. TedPhillips Hey guys, don't worry. Google says Android is for everyone. https://www.android.com/everyone/ That includes AOSP developers too, right? That website seems to tread the line pretty carefully, ala 'no one is forcing you use Google play' but Hiroshi's quote seems like it comes with a grain of salt since he owns Play. I'd love to see AP interview him about this. qkjDlav As an app developer for a large app used globally, the two biggest time wasters in a developer's life are a) debugging device specific issues (HTC, Samsung, etc) and b) crash logs with Xposed in the stack trace. Developers are tired of having to sit around with device farms at their desks just to make sure new features and changes work with each quirky variant of Android that manufacturers want to deploy, and custom roms do make it worse. Enthusiasts are welcome to customize their own versions of Android and sideload apps, but we don't want to see crashlogs in the Developer Console from rooted/custom ROM users. And companies probably don't want to keep paying us to debug issues that only a small minority of users will see. Lê Nguyên Chương Most stupid thing I've ever heard in my life.

Netflix was just the start: Google Play Console lets developers exclude app availability for devices that don't pass SafetyNet Rita El Khoury Follow View All Posts 2017/05/18 3:57am PDTMay 18, 2017 93 Plus 1 on G+ 108 Share on Facebook 82 Share on Twitter Total Shares283 Google News Last weekend, a huge turmoil swept the root-enthusiast Android community as it was discovered then confirmed that the Netflix app was being blocked from showing up in search results on the Play Store for rooted devices. At the time, Netflix said it was using Widevine to block unsupported devices, but that made no sense to us: the app was still functional if it was sideloaded, it was only not showing up as compatible in the Play Store. So what sorcery was Netflix really using?! Turns out it's a new function of the Google Play Console. As part of the updates announced for the Play Console at I/O 2017, Google mentions a new Device Catalog section under Release management that lets developers choose with intricate granularity which devices their app supports on the Play Store. Devices can be viewed and excluded by many attributes including RAM and SoC, but the important factor we're interested in is SafetyNet Attestation. New "Device catalog" lets devs manage the exclusions. Developers will be able to choose from 3 states shown in the top image: not excluding devices based on SafetyNet, excluding those that don't pass integrity, or excluding the latter plus those that aren't certified by Google. That means any dev could potentially block their apps from showing and being directly installable in the Play Store on devices that are rooted and/or running a custom ROM, as well as on emulators and uncertified devices (think Meizu and its not-so-legal way of getting Play Services and the Play Store on its phones). This is exactly what many of you were afraid would happen after the Play Store app started surfacing a Device certification status. This is different from the full SafetyNet API implementation that apps like Android Pay and Pokémon Go use. In the case of Pay/Go, the attestation check happens when the app is installed on your phone and doesn't allow it to run unless it passes the integrity test. But in the case of the Play Console, the attestation check happens when you're browsing the Play Store and only affects the availability of the app for your device. If the full SafetyNet API isn't included in the app itself, you will still be able to grab the APK from other sources, install it, and the app will work just fine. Still, this spells trouble for rooted users and the Android enthusiast community as a whole. Google keeps erecting more and more obstacles each day in the face of root and custom ROMs and even if this won't stop root users who should be knowledgable enough to know how/where to grab an APK and install it, it will make things more and more difficult and maybe less and less worth the trouble. But y'all are rebels and you'll keep on finding a way around it, won't you?

Nice move Google. Suicide_Note Not sure if serious, but either way, this was just a matter of time. YouNex Obviously not serious EowynCarter So, question : Is there anyway to get android O in the future on my nexus 6 and not having problems with this ? IF manufacturer where taking care of updating their devices, wouldn't be an issue... saf1927 If Magisk keeps working, yep. You can. Even my old Nexus 5 is on 7.1.2 and it passes SafetyNet. EowynCarter I want "just work" stuff. Not workaround. Maybe Magisk does the job for some, but not an acceptable solution from my point of view. Mainly the "we don't know if it will keep on working" part. saf1927 Well, it's the best solution so far and it has improved a lot since its inception. I never bothered since the Nexus 5 was a secondary device for me, but now that some apps won't show up anymore on the Play Store, I simply flashed Magisk and that's about it. I haven't tweaked anything. Plus, if you are already flashing a custom ROM, flashing an extra zip file isn't that much work anyway. EowynCarter True, but it's the phone I use dailly. I don't want apps sudendly not working, becasue google decided to push an update that broke magisk. mxwp well if you want things to "just work" then i guess get an iPhone EowynCarter Sadly, I'm beginning to think about that. But that would cause others frustrations. ED-Zが現れた! Well, people will just flock to root-supported apps... Milton P. I actually forgot when was the last time I Rooted a device. No biggie. Suicide_Note The bad thing is it isn't just root that causes problems. Simply unlocking the bootloader will produce the same result. Maxr1998 Just because it's no biggie for you, it doesn't mean everyone approves this. I am actually pretty concerned, because this limits the freedom over our devices even more.. Milton P. Define freedom, please. Maxr1998 Software freedom, to be more specific. You should have the freedom to use and modify your device and it's software however you'd like, and have fill control over it. That means, root access. And since the AOSP core IS free software, the 4 freedoms defined by Richard Stallman apply to it. What this change now introduces is that you're forced to decide between either giving up the freedom over your device or not using the app you wanted to download (which will probably have to be my choice, and that sucks). Milton P. But you're not giving up anything, you just have to make a choice. If you put that way, Google has the freedom of doing with the AOSP core whatever they want, the same way you can modify said core and do as you please, the difference is Google has more money and more responsibilities when it comes to their user base. XDA and other sites will still have a bunch of developers making whatever they please (within the AOSP terms) with the AOSP core. This will just change thinks for the people that use those ROMs bit realistically the vast majority of users won't feel the changes. Sad but true. h4rr4r That choice is giving up freedom you had before. The vast majority will see the rate of Android improvements slow as the Devs on XDA and the like lose interest. Android only exists because of Linux, now it is turning its back on that whole culture. Milton P. Well, I don't see your freedom compromised to be honest with you, but we're seeing things from different angles so that's that. Sorry for your loss in that case. h4rr4r You do not think losing control of your device is a loss of freedom? Milton P. Nope, is just a device, I have more important stuff going on, m device is a tool the same way a hammer is a tool, you can buy a hammer and use it as it is. Sometimes my device is a toy, if I buy a remote control car I'll modify it as long as it is possible, the same way I modify my phone. I have control over my phone. I can install whatever I want at my own risk. If I decide to root my phone I expect things to be broken. I remember when I had an HTC and I hated sense so I decided to install a custom ROM, I gave up the camera and I was aware of it. There was always some compromises with custom ROMs, nothing is changing. I rather have a safe device then a compromised one today, still my choice thou. h4rr4r So you want IOS. Got it. Over here I want freedom. I don't think homedepot should be allowed to tell me what I can hit with the hammer I bought. trparky Open platforms rarely stay open once they become popular. Once the Benjamins come rolling in it tends to override open. h4rr4r Tell that to Linus Torvalds. I am sure he will have many many fuck yous for you. trparky Linux is the rare situation. h4rr4r The rare situation like many others that created android and even google. trparky Yeah but look at Android, the walls are closing around it and there's nothing you can do about it. Face it man, the geeks may have built the system but the common man now rules it. Geeks love choice, yes, they do love their choice but your average person doesn't give a rat's ass about choice. All they want is a device that does what they need it to do when they want to do it. They have no inclination to learn how it works or why it works just as long as it does. This is what geeks do not and refuse to understand. h4rr4r Sure there is, stop using it. Then the common folks will have to follow us to the next platform. trparky As long as their is money involved in maintaining Android it doesn't matter if something better comes along, people will continue supporting Android because it makes them money. Money makes the world go round, get used to it. Maxr1998 ^ What @h4rr4r:disqus says. trparky Yep. The root and ROM community is such a small portion of the Android ecosystem that they really don't matter to them. People have been screaming at Google for years to get the Android house fixed up, this is them doing just that. You can't blame them for doing what the people have asked for. mxwp I agree with you, but sadly you only have freedom over hardware. You can do what you want with the device you buy. But with software you never actually buy it... you only buy a license to use it. Thus you have no real freedom with software. Maxr1998 Android is free software, Apache 2.0 license. At least the AOSP part of it. trparky But the Google parts of it are not covered under the Apache 2.0 license. That's essentially why ROM developers can't package the Google Play Services pack with the ROM itself and instead requires you to download a separate ZIP package from Google to install it separate from the ROM package. Android itself may be free and open but the Google Play Services part is not. Sudev There are far more than few arguments against root access but here are some: Root access is meant for experimental & development purpose and not for Daily Driver for any average user of the platform. Google Play Services & Apps available on Play Store are not "Free Software". Google as provider of Play Services infrastructure has much more liabilities then one can simply assume. And also the app developers have responsibility to protect end users' data. If device has root access available and any rouge app / maleware steals other apps data which is possible, who will be at stack? h4rr4r The ability to do anything I want with my things that I own. Milton P. You​ can do whatever you want with your device, nobody is stopping you. You might see that some apps are not showing up in the play store but you can still side load them, I still see freedom in your future. h4rr4r For how much longer? Soon these apps will ask play services if they are supposed to be installed on that device, at that point you can say goodbye to sideloading. If this is what people want then IOS was the platform for them. thecoolkid Ok Google, define freedom... 😁 Nick I would imagine a great deal of people on this site will be upset, but in actuality I don't think this will affect the user base of many apps that badly h4rr4r Not in the short term. However in the long term it will. Android only exists because of the FREE software movement. Nick Yes, but that doesn't apply to applications, which this is about. h4rr4r Think long term. Same thing applies. trparky No it won't because the root and ROM community is so small it doesn't matter to Google anymore. The 95% of people who simply want a device that works don't care and likely won't ever care. As long as they can play NetFlix, Pokemon Go, or whatever is the next craze they don't care. h4rr4r Again, that is short term thinking. Think past the end of your nose. Android exists because of linux. Google needs this small group to create the very stuff they rely on. trparky You overestimate the value that the community has now. Android may have needed the community back in the beginning to gain the foothold that it has in the market but not so anymore. Android has near 100% market penetration, they have achieved world domination. They don't need the community anymore, they have achieved their goals. h4rr4r Until they are unseated. IBM once had a monopoly on computing devices. They did not need the community to gain a foothold, they would not have a product to gain a foothold without the community. Android only exists because of a collection of those projects. trparky No, Android exists because Samsung, HTC, and LG make devices people want and it makes them money by the semi-truck full. The community doesn't mean shit now, all that matters to these companies is one thing... money, money, and more money. Oh, and did I mention money? This is capitalism man, money rules the world. If you don't make money you are dead. h4rr4r Please tell me how that would have happened without linux. Money loses to good engineering every day. Look at how linux killed solaris. trparky Tell me why Windows is the defacto monopoly on the desktop despite the fact that Linux is better in every damn way possible under the hood? That's right... money. h4rr4r Because the desktop is dead. The fight is over. They lost. Even money can't keep them relevant. trparky Oh, you're funny. The desktop is not dead, it will never be dead. When people need to do real work, they sit down at a desktop. When people want to play real games, they sit down at a desktop. When people need to type out anything longer than a page like a college term paper, they sit down at a desktop. The desktop is king and will always be king. Long live the desktop! h4rr4r The Desktop is a dead man walking. When they do real work, they use a Citrix session. When they game they use a console, or they are already nerds. When people type they can use a fucking chromebook. The desktop as you think of it died already. trparky Try and say that shit over at TechPowerUp, HardOCP, Overclock.net, TomsHardware, etc. and trust me when I say this... you'll be run out of town by people with pitchforks and torches. h4rr4r Those are all nerds. Those are the folks who have desktops running 3 different OSes. They are the folks who are pissed about android being locked down. trparky And your point being? You just admitted that only the "nerds" care about Android being open. Sure, those same "nerds" will go off and create a new platform but the rest of the people who are living in the real world and who don't care one damn bit about how it works will continue to use Android. h4rr4r Those people will eventually move to the new platform. Just like they did with Android. trparky And the same thing will happen to that platform in the future that's happening to Android now. Open platforms are nice and all, I'll admit that, but your average person doesn't care one bit. I dare you to go up to any person on the street and ask them anything about Android. What phone do they have? What model? Most will say "I don't know, something that my carrier gave me for cheap." h4rr4r The wheel of computing we call it. It has happened and will happen again. So what? trparky Which reinforces the idea that I said before, eventually all open systems will become closed (or less open) at some point in their life cycle. It usually happens when it becomes popular with the common man. Why? Because like I've been trying to get through your thick skull, the average person doesn't care how any of this stuff works so long as it works. h4rr4r The average person does not matter. Few open systems become closed. AOSP is still fine. trparky What the hell do you mean by "they don't matter"? They're the ones buying the devices, buying the apps, looking at the ads, etc. Just how the fuck does that translate to "they don't matter"? h4rr4r Because they don't. They don't create, they don't cause new things to be created. They are just users, just like I don't matter to how movies are created. trparky But without money from the people who are consuming said things developers won't make new stuff. Developers do have to eat you know and put a roof over their heads. h4rr4r The giant world of FOSS pretty much proves you wrong. Demand cannot create supply. I don't pirate anything kiddo. I have way too much to lose for that. One of those lawsuits I would actually have to pay, since I could. trparky I'll give a hint on how FOSS works a lot of the time. Some of the top tier Linux kernel developers actually work for companies and they just contribute code in their free time. They may work for Intel, AMD, nVidia, or God knows what but only after their day job is done. Why? Because they need money and they need to eat. This is a basic requirement for people in this world. They need money!!! People don't just write code for the love of it, even Linus Torvalds who's in charge of the Linux kernel itself works for the Linux Foundation and yes, he gets paid for his work to the tune of $10 Million a year. Sorry to burst your bubble man but FOSS projects aren't all happy, happy, joy, joy here... people need to be paid real money to be able to eat, drive a car, put a roof over their heads, etc. On second thought, I'm not sorry I burst your bubble! You need it burst! PEOPLE NEED TO BE PAID REAL FUCKING MONEY!!!! h4rr4r No, they get paid to contribute. During the work day. Not as a hobby. Lots of projects are like that. I won't say exactly how I know about that ;) Their employers just aren't as short sighted as you. Linus did not however create linux to get rich. Great code like great art gets created because it must be. People do what they love. Kid, you will get it one day. When you have enough that you aren't worried about it each day, money stops being that big of a deal. Don't worry everybody goes through a phase like you are now. trparky Dude, we are not the Federation of Planets here living in a happy, happy, joy, joy world in which people can just do whatever they want to do without a care in the world. As long as human greed exists there will always be a need for money. And believe you me, greed will never go away unless we breed a new kind of human and I don't see that happening any time soon. Gene Roddenberry's future will never happen, it just won't. Contrary to a lot of geek dreams it just won't. h4rr4r No idea where you got that idea. Never suggested it. My point was the personal relative value of increasing income drops as income goes up. If you make minimum wage doubling your income is a huge deal. Adding the same amount to my income would not get me to take a job I like less. Offering it to Linus would be a waste of time. Yes, some people will keep chasing dollars, they are the exception not the rule. The employers are working on enlightened self interest. Either they use the FOSS product, gain market advantage with direct knowledge, use it for marketing or believe they are getting something else. PostgreSQL for example has a lot of paid contributors who work for companies that either provide customization, consulting or depend on the project. Others just because it increases quality. Commercial software by and large is not high quality. I have seen a lot of it and 90% if you tried to submit it to a FOSS project of any size would get you denied and possibly mocked. This system continues to be more innovative because it is easy to continue to expand. Anyone with a good idea can fork if their idea is not accepted. trparky > My point was the personal relative value of increasing income drops as income goes up. Tell that to the people in Washington or any CEO that demands ever increasing yearly salaries and end of year bonuses all while raping the companies that they work for. Tell that to the psychopaths on Wall Street. For as long as their is money, people will want more of it. Anyone who says that they don't is flat out lying. h4rr4r Those are the exception not the rule. That is why you call them psychopaths. Honestly, correcting for inflation I really don't care that much if I ever make more. Would it be nice sure, would I give up anything I like about my job? No. If you could double my income but it prevented me from contributing to FOSS projects or owning code I generate off the clock, I would not take that deal. If money was enough to make people do anything MS would have offered Linus $11 million a year to not write it. Heck, Sun would have done it while they were still around. trparky Either you're a child that doesn't know how the adult world works or you're a fucking troll. h4rr4r So you have no idea who makes stuff, neat. I guess you think Henry Ford should have made a faster horse. trparky Oh, I know who makes the stuff I use but I also make sure that they are paid! I give money to those developers who write the programs that I enjoy and if I can't pay them I won't use their programs. I only use a program if I can pay for it. I have put money into their tip jars on their web site, I look for PayPal links and I donate even if it's something small like $5. They deserve it! h4rr4r Good for you! There is a lot of great software that does not make money that way. Some even just ask is that you follow the license, like linux which mediatek steals by not releasing kernel source. So I hope you avoid buying that kind of thing. trparky MediaTek controller chips are known to suck so I don't buy them out of that reason alone. h4rr4r Now I have given you another good reason to avoid them. Bunch of thieves. Rita El Khoury I don't even remember when I last bootloader unlocked. But I know this move toward closing the ecosystem further and further will have ripples in the future. The enthusiast community flocked toward Android for its openness and we have custom ROMs and their enterprising devs to thank for HUNDREDS of new features that they implemented first and everyone clamored for and applauded until they became features in AOSP. If Google thinks it can steer this ship alone and it knows best what to do next, we may have less and less interesting features in the future and more and more of what only one entity thinks is best, not a diverse set of opinions. Nick Given that this only gives the developer the option of requiring these checks, it makes me believe that Google had to do this for some companies that have regulatory or other kinds of requirements. Which is a shame for the rooted (and unlocked?) community, but understandable. Shame Google is most likely going to take the blame here in this comment section though. Rita El Khoury Well, maybe they had to, but that won't stop any developer from implementing it without any regulatory or legal requirement pushing them to do so. Nick Right, which puts this choice on the developer, not Google. Google was stuck behind a rock and hard place, perhaps. EowynCarter Well, google is certainly to blame for not planing to update my nexus 6 to android O. And now I can't even use custom rom as plan B without losing some apps :( Suicide_Note Boo hoo. Buy a new phone and quit crying that Google doesn't support phones forever. EowynCarter Fine can you order a pixel XL and ship it to me in France ? Plus, my nexus 6 still works, I hate having to replace working stuff. Makes no sense, economically and ecologically speaking. Suicide_Note I'll sell you my XL when I'm done with it, but only after i get the Pixel XL 2. :) EowynCarter Well, I do hope Google sells the "pixel 2 "( or whatever its name) here. For now, I'm'just hoping my nexus 6 don't break. Else I might jump on the iOS ship. I'm not convinced the the other android alternatives. Note 8 would be the closest, but touchwiiz, delayed updates.... I'm spoiled after a few years with a nexus. Suicide_Note There always eBay or Swappa if you want to get a first gen Pixel. I was looking at prices over the weekend, and mint condition Pixels are going for about $450. EowynCarter Not so much in France. And eBay for suff that cost more that a few bucks, too risky. Plus, the pixel is getting "old" by now. Wilton Daniel Pinto Troll found trparky Yet Microsoft still supports Windows 7 EIGHT YEARS LATER! How come Microsoft can do that yet Google can't? Alex Louderback Actually, that's Qualcomm EowynCarter Source for this ? trparky And Qualcomm can go fuck themselves. Gee... I wonder why they're being hit with an anti-trust lawsuit. Could this be one of many reasons why? trparky Yes, Google is to blame for that. There's no damn reason why your Nexus 6 can't run Android O other than the fact that they just don't want to. Bojan Bunić My bootloader was unlocked prior to changing the mobo on my 5X, courtesy of Booty Loops. Root, well, probably before I got my Nexus 4. Although I'll see how it'll go on in the future, as we don't have Pixels here, so the only near stock possibility is either OnePlus, or some other device and a custom ROM. Milton P. Agree 100% with you, I mean I remember the old days when I hated HTC's Sense, I literally decided that a phone without a camera was better than whatever HTC did back then, but Android has evolved quite a lot nowadays, don't get me wrong, I do believe that custom ROMs did a great job showing Google what the users want but that won't change, as long as someone shows Google what people want Google will keep improving Android, because there's no limits. Now if they go the Apple way and lock EVERYTHING then we'll be fucked, I'm the meantime developers will find a way around the system pushing Google along. Premsuraj An open bootloader and root actually solves a lot of problems still existing in AOSP. The Nougat update absolutely destoryed the battery life of many Nexus 6P devices, with Google only focussing on the Pixels, there was no fix in it. I unlocked, used Franco Kernel + naptime + Greenify and I now I get adequate battery life. Another feature I can think of is theming. Material design is good, but the whiteness is rage inducing Maxr1998 Well, fuck them. Let's just hope not many devs will use this, and Google won't enable this by default anytime soon. Maxr1998 The more I think about this, the more concerned I get. This will reduce the freedom over our devices, and also limit developers in the awesome things they could do before because of Android's openness. I am all in for device security and fighting against malware, trojans and phishing applications, don't understand me wrong, but that doesn't mean that you have to take people away their freedom - just look at how Linux (GNU and Linux) is doing it. Tom Westrick How does this limit developers? If anything it gives them more control. Maxr1998 Fair point, I should have been more specific. With "developers", I meant rom developers and modders, app developers only if they require root access for their apps. "Normal" developers can use this to enforce a "secure" (read: DRM locked-down) environment, but that's not really a good thing in my opinion.. (Refer to my other comments.) trparky You're angry at the wrong people, you should be angry at Hollywood; they're the ones that are demanding this kind of stuff. Their content, their rules; it's how things are in the real world. They have to do what they need to do to protect their investments, plain and simple. We don't necessarily have to like it, hell... we may even hate it, but that's how it is. You want the content? Play by their rules. Colin Richardson If you are an app developer and want your app to run on custom roms..... don't turn on "Requires SafetyNet"... bekifft We are increasingly living in the future Richard Stallman warned us about. With Google taking all these steps, may as well go back to using jailbroken iPhones. Bart Janusz I've already enabled it and I know at least 3 others devs that did it as well. I really don't care about root per se, but custom roms and xposed is source of countless problem as both are buggy as hell. Maxr1998 But in which way does that influence you? Xposed can introduce bugs to the system, sure, but it won't affect the performance of your app unless it itself is modded, so you probably don't have to fear bad reviews for bad performance anyway. And custom roms? LineageOS on my mother's Moto G runs like a champ and much better than the 5.1 stock rom before. And in my experience as a dev, there were much more incompatibilities with Samsung TouchWiz than with AOSP-based custom roms. refthemc I'm sure he's just trying to avoid the headache of emails he gets daily from users who have no idea that it's their fault the app is not working or crashing... Bart Janusz Indeed, not to mention extra crash and ANRs reports which seems to influence app positioning. Maxr1998 But why? The device may behave more buggy at some parts because of Xposed (and mine definitely ran like shit on MM because of some mods, but I NEVER blamed any apps), but the apps itself won't run worse if not modded - normally they should even run better if you only use performance mods like Greenify, NLP Collector wakelock disabler and other light mods. I don't think he gets many reports anyway, considering what @marcusmarcus2:disqus said. Bart Janusz You may not, but many users do, and as I said there are a lot of bogus ANRs and crash reports. Since my app depends heavily on low level OS elements both custom ROMs and xposed are deal breakers (and you really should check source, since I do not update my website as I moved to G+/FB but app has sizable user base given its niche and I'd to deal with ROM/xposed issues fequently). Maxr1998 Well, but the same type of users also give bad reviews etc. without using any mod or root. You generalize modders to only cause problems, and therefore lock out everyone. About your app/website thing: fair point, I didn't look at it yet, and have to apologize for being a little rude. marcusmarcus2 You need to take your own advice, "you really should check source". If you moved to G+/FB, then why does your app on the play store still point to the same website as well. Or at least put a link on the old website that directs to G+/FB. There is nothing that points to your so called G+/FB source. So @Maxr1998:disqus has no other source to check at the moment. Bart Janusz Not that I care but if you try to draw conclusion about app you should probably visit Play Store listing. Anyhow that's really not important I just chimed in to explain why developer will use this. I've choose to do so due to extra burden which in effect hurts majority of my user base, one of my colleagues cited lucky patcher and freedom (which I think is not such a good idea but its his choice). trparky You may not blame the apps because you know better but most people don't understand that, most people see a crashing app and suddenly you see, as the developer, a ton of comments saying that your app sucks. h4rr4r Please do tell us about your apps so we can be sure to avoid them on any devices we have not yet rooted. marcusmarcus2 His disqus profile leads to this website http://artflowstudio.com/ which has a few apps listed. Art oriented apps. There is only 1 update on that website since 2014, so I don't think I would be to concerned about installing one of his apps. Jordan Palmer Nice detective work. Adrian I can see a lot of refund requests coming from people who paid for apps and suddenly are told "Nope. Not for you anymore." A lot of us are rooted and buy apps and you'd better believe noise will be made if an app I use daily, that I paid for, suddenly breaks with an update because it's no longer blessed by the dev to run on my device. It's your app and you can do what you want with it, but there is always another side to the coin. BAlGaInTl That's not the way that Netflix worked it, and I doubt other developers of paid apps would either. I have a OnePlus One, that I run Lineage OS on since the original Cyanogen OS is now defunct and does not receive any updates. Netflix simply doesn't update to v 5+. It still works just fine. I may not get the newest and latest features, but part of that is on me for using a device that is dated. I'm not one of those users who, because I paid for an app once, fells that I should get all of the updates from now until the end of time. That isn't sustainable for developers. It could very well be that Netflix has some new features/offerings in the works in which they are getting pressure from outside sources to push this. A lot of valid reasons for a developer to enable the check exist. As long as they do it in the same manner that Netflix has, I don't see the issue. Adrian And just like Pokemon Go, eventually you'll get a message that you need to upgrade to the latest version or the app won't work, you know, that new version that won't let you actually log into it anymore. We've already seen this happen so let's not pretend that it isn't the next logical step. They aren't going to keep letting people sign in indefinitely with an app that doesn't have the security level they want. It's naive to think that hey I can just stick with the last version that works for root. It takes all of what, the time it takes to create a switch that says minimum version required to log in is "DRM version" BAlGaInTl Good Point. I recognize that. But it seems that the blame (in general) is being directed at Google in many of these posts. If that scenario happens, it isn't Google that blocked you from accessing Netflix. The need for this level of security is on the increase. The same users demanding better security and longer updates are the first ones to cry foul when Google starts laying the groundwork for exactly what they have asked for. Adrian I think there is a way to do both that doesn't piss off a very active community that helped take Android from a very very very ugly, second class OS to what we have now. I know a lot of us remember just how crippled Android was and it was the root/mod community that produced the bulk of what is now standard on Android. There needs to be a way to secure the devices AND not turn their back on the developer community that contributes. The idea, in Netflix's case, that root = pirate is insane. Why in the world would someone prefer to rip content on their phone to say a computer or XBox that is never going to move and can do it while you get on with your life? They're doing something for the sake of saying they're doing something, but if they think it's going to make a dent in piracy they, and the studios are nuts. I watch a lot of Netflix and still prefer to buy discs. People who do things the right way and are perfectly happy paying for content shouldn't have to jump through hoops to watch it. Those of us who root usually have a handful of things that stock Android is not doing for us. It's why we root. If all of these things were available in stock, my reasons for rooting would disappear but I don't see that happening any time soon. I think Android is getting so much better but if they make it exactly like iOS, might as well go to the dark side because Apple's apps tend to be more polished, come out first and OS updates are frequent. Don't bite the hand that feeds you just because you're getting more popular. BAlGaInTl I think that Netflix is a good example. It is HIGHLY likely that the reason for recent unpopular changes (see also VPN blocking) are being driven by other entities. It isn't that Netflix thinks its a problem, but the people that control a large portion of their content do. root pirate but it does introduce a security risk. I don't see how Google is turning their backs on developers. Developers are free to develop as they see fit and choose (at least for the moment) whether or not they will implement the SafetyNet check. The inherent problem is that a circumvented security is still circumvented and can no longer be considered secure. I can clearly see why some apps would and should frown upon that. Maybe not Netflix and Mario (IMHO), but certainly something like bank and payment apps. I don't think the inherent open nature of android will ever reduce to the level of iOS. But some changes have to occur to meet the needs/desire of the majority. Security is inherently difficult. The easier and more flexible you try to make it, the less secure it becomes. Adrian I do think banking apps should run in a secure space. Completely agree with that, but I disagree with root = less secure. My nexus devices stopped getting OS and security updates. Nothing. VERY insecure and dangerous. I rooted them, updated the OS with images from XDA developers and my devices that were once easy targets are more secure. There is always two sides to it. I see that Google is finally trying to take security seriously on Android and doing things in layers that completely cut out the vendor AND the carriers is the right step. Right now, Root is the only way to update a perfectly good device like my Nexus tablet tablet that the vendor said "oh well" to. Until Google has a REAL strategy in place to keep ALL Android devices secure, root will be necessary. Not everyone wants to or can upgrade devices every two years because they get abandoned. My father doesn't need an S8. He does need a device that gets security updates for more than a year after purchasing his phone. BAlGaInTl You are exactly correct, and I'm in the same situation with my OnePlus One. But in working to increase your security level, you leave holes behind. The key words that you used are "more secure." I agree. You are "more secure." But still (probably) less secure than a device that has been thoroughly tested, certified, and passes SafetyNet without hacks. Google has been open that they are working on security updates. They have improved significantly over the last couple years in getting those out. I feel that they are putting in place a real strategy to keep Android devices secure. This is part of that groundwork. I also feel that they are actively looking to replace Android in it's current state, and I can't say I blame them. The only real strategy may be to take lessons learned and start over. Lucky for them, they have the resources to do so. trparky > take lessons learned and start over Pretty much. The worst thing that they did from the very beginning was to allow for the OEMs to do what they wished. Google essentially made a deal with the devil when they released Android to the world. They wrote no requirements into the Android agreements that the OEMs agreed to to require updates to be a necessary thing. Big mistake Google. BAlGaInTl The really needed to in order to get their foot in the door of the market. If it would not have been open source from the beginning, none of the major manufactures would have bought off on it. The fact that they could use it for free (essentially) and still be able to customize on top of it is what sold it. trparky And now look at it, Android is a fucking mess of non-updated insecure devices that are ripe for anyone to be able to take over and turn into a botnet. trparky And you should be raising holy hell with the OEM that made that device! Just because your device is old doesn't mean that it shouldn't still be supported. Windows 7 is nearly eight years old and it still receives Windows Updates. Why can't your device? BAlGaInTl Normally, I would agree, but the OnePlus One is a special case. The OEM operating system is the now defunct Cyanogen OS. I had to balance having the original OS without updates, or running another with updates. The phone is now almost three years old. If I bought a PC with Windows on it three years ago, and Microsoft had since gone out of business, should the PC manufacturer be responsible for providing Windows 7 updates? Even though the PC is beyond it's support date? Sure, I can increase the security by switching to another OS that is updated. It may even be a Windows clone. But if a software developer decided to only support "original, unmodified" PC configurations, that would be within their right. trparky But it can be adapted to run LineageOS. Sudev There is bit difference in analogy here: OnePlus manufactured the phone and Cynogen Inc customized AOSP Android OS for it, they didn't developed it from ground up. I understand that Cynogen INC is out of business now too. However in PC world, it would be the case that you purchased a PC from Dell and get Microsoft Windows OS with some additional Dell software. If Dell or developer of that custom software goes out of business you still get OS update for your PC. Its not android OS itself out business here. Adrian and for the record, I absolutely agree that it was the content providers and not all on Netflix. trparky You should be demanding that OnePlus send an official update to your device. So what if your device is old? It should be still supported. Windows 7 is still supported nearly eight years later, why can't your device be supported for that long as well? Plumplam Who cares except for a bunch of XDA nerds? If it means better security then I'm all for it. Dmitri Smirnov Well, for starters, it doesn't mean better security, since it does nothing to address the problems with vulnerable outdated android versions that will be "certified", but will allow malicious apps to quietly escalate their privileges and do their dirty work, but will block "uncertified" custom roms that actually have all the recent secuirity patches and give user full control over who has root access and how. Also, "bunch of XDA nerds" are the source of a lot of features that had their trial run in custom ROMs and then were adopted to the AOSP. Should I remind you of "The Oak and the Pig" fable? Alienate the developers bringing new ideas to the ecosystem - lose the competetive edge you had over other OSes saf1927 Actually, custom ROMs never really have the latest security patches despite what they claim since kernels aren't maintained and no proprietary blobs is updated anymore. If ROM developers were OEMs, they'd be violating their agreements with Google by bumping the patch level without actually addressing all the vulnerabilities. Dmitri Smirnov Well they patch the AOSP to the same level as latest official one and kernel - if it's possible to do so without breaking the compatibility with compiled blobs or at least on the level of latest official firmware. So in the end run it's at least as secure as the official firmware, often - much more so. saf1927 If you look at the security bulletin, most vulnerabilities come from proprietary drivers and require these to be updated. On a supported device, these are provided by the chip manufacturers to the OEMs, on an unsupported device they aren't updated anymore. A custom ROM can only fix userspace security issues. In the end, bumping the patch level without addressing all vulnerabilities in that patch gives a false sense of security to users. Dmitri Smirnov If anything, this is an argument for forcing OEMs to opensource their blobs. For some reason community is much better at releasing the fixes for what they can change (userspace), while OEMs generally stop caring as soon as device is out the door. saf1927 The problem goes beyond OEMs unfortunately. All the phones you can buy are assembled with off-the-shelf components that they buy from other manufacturers and it is them that provide the binary blobs to the OEMs. If they stop supporting components, the OEMs can't do anything. For the chip, it's companies like Qualcomm, Samsung, Mediatek etc. that need to support it with up-to-date drivers. Once they stop, the life-cycle of a phone comes to an end. trparky And that is probably one of many reason why Qualcomm is facing a nice fat anti-trust lawsuit. Serves them right. trparky That ain't ever going to happen. There's no way they're going to allow for their intellectual property to be open for all the world to see and have it cracked open. It would be corporate suicide since their competitors would be able to reverse engineer their stuff. Suicide_Note Never heard of "The Oak and the Pig" before. Could you tell me more? Seriously. Dmitri Smirnov http://www.aliceswonderland.eu/Alice-ska350-en.html Maxr1998 Ah, Lessing. Going to read the original version in a minute :) username_not_valid Thats a very generous view of the custom ROM community. It might be true of a few, very few devs, but most ROMs are unsupported garbage with serious security issues. Dmitri Smirnov Maybe so, but out of this cesspool of garbage CyanogenMod was born, which became LineageOS. I'd say their quality standard appeals me more than a lot of OEMs. username_not_valid Cyanogen and Lineage was what i had in mind.. Each to his own i guess. BAlGaInTl Yes and no. I run Lineage on my OnePlus One because Cyanogen OS is no longer supported. I can say with certainty that Lineage introduces stability issues that I have to deal with to be up to date. Wilton Daniel Pinto Ninna pooty bewarci Qwip Consider the bigger picture. Right now, users are being shuffled into a situation where they must restrict the control they have over their device if they want to be able to use Netflix (and presumably banking apps will follow soon). That may seem fine, and from some security perspective it is probably a good thing. How much control do you have over your _laptop_? How much do you want? Right now, we're blissfully able to install unsigned software on our computers (although various OSs will complain about it), but will that last? How long will it be before we can only open our banking interface on our laptop using a trusted, digitally signed browser on a machine that is using secure boot and can only run signed binaries? I can understand the direction that Netflix (and others) are coming from, and to them it may even make sense. The question is: what is the cost of ceding control over our devices/machines in order to be able to watch netflix, etc. trparky Yeah and that's why Windows is the virus filled cesspool that it is today. Windows 10 is slowly changing Windows to be an app store based ecosystem in which all apps will be sandboxed. It's coming to the desktop near you. saf1927 I hope Magisk (or other similar mods in the future) keep working, so to prevent this. Not a problem on my Pixel XL since I haven't rooted it, but on my Nexus 5 Magisk allows it to pass Safety Net even though it's running a custom ROM (7.1.2) and it's rooted. Hendrik Leppkes SafetyNets primary purpose is to secure devices for Android Pay, and when you deal with actual money transactions on your device, you really don't want any hack interfering with it - so I'm quite certain they'll do whatever they can to break hacks like this and ensure the security and integrity of the device. h4rr4r No, its primary purpose is to make the device trustworthy for others not the person who paid for it. This is how it makes it "secure" for android pay. You are a possible threat and this closes that. Suicide_Note It would seem that Google is erecting a wall around their garden, too. EowynCarter While Apple opens iOS more and more. YouNex According to the support/help page, a device is not certified if it stops getting Android updates. How fuck up is that ? I don't get it. My Moto X has always been on stock ROM, yet it's showing up as non certified. Yes it's rooted + system modifications, but at no point is it stated that root prevents it from being certified. Suicide_Note Really? You can't understand why your rooted/system modified device is non-certified? YouNex I know how to read, but this is vague https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/b6f710b8628f0e09ab73ba144c133a2c9b1fe1325b353ae7dc1636f2776b2ac0.png "Not secure" jonzey231 Root and/or unlocked bootloader = Not certified. YouNex It says nothing about root or bootloader https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/b6f710b8628f0e09ab73ba144c133a2c9b1fe1325b353ae7dc1636f2776b2ac0.png ast00 Can't wait until LastPass excludes root users... Fuck them. Adonis K. If they do, I'm cancelling my subscription... Naxx ENVY Fuck them and yet they haven't done anything yet ... #internetlogic Also i know right , crazy for a company that stores your passwords to make themselves more secure . ABSOLUTE CRAZY , RAGE RAGE RAGE Jordan Palmer I don't understand your reasoning or rationale for these two statements. ast00 The second part is related to Google. Sorry about the confusion. Believe it or not, most of us root users keep SELinux in it's Enforcing state. This means we are safe. Nothing gets root rights without us knowing. Our phones are just as safe if not safer than most stock phones. JATIN BANSAL SafetyNet test can be passed using Magisk Manager. I am using it and it works fine for me. Even in play store, my device is certified. May be this helps someone. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/3756499ff5876545740cd0e88e38961bb2c327d90fc43f5801f4bce5d802c990.png https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/44185f640490cb506a68a3414579bd345123f7d52ee2e11802d31d5141db11ae.png Nick Most people are worried about the future when the exploits that Magisk uses are patched and it continues to make it harder for people to get around this. JATIN BANSAL That's what I am also worried about. I just posted this for those who are already rooted and for now want to keep the root. My main purpose of rooting was to flash lineage OS. I think custom rom is the only way of staying updated to latest version of Android as google itself doesn't update their phones after 2 years (18 months I think) for reasons they have. I think if someone buys a flagship device which costs 700$+, it should have 3-4 years of full software update support. 😆😄 2 years of major OS version updates and 3 years of security patches. After 3 years, its time to buy a new phone cuz its so old anyway. trparky Says you! Windows 7 was released on July 22, 2009 and they still support it EIGHT YEARS LATER! And they plan on supporting it until the year 2020 which means it will be supported for a total of ELEVEN YEARS! If Microsoft can do it, Google can too!!! Does Microsoft suddenly say "Your machine is too old, go buy a new one"? No, they continue to give you Windows Updates for years later. We should also be demanding that the Android OEMs do so as well. A Samsung Note 5 has more than enough hardware in it to run Android 7 but no... we can't do that, we need to make money so we don't update them to force you to buy a new device. Lambdadelta Magisk...alright, thanks for the tip-off. I really must get it. TadMSTR Magisk doesn't always pass SafetyNet. I have some devices it fails on. However, several other devices it works just fine. Make sure you turn on the hide root option, it's off by default. Lambdadelta Well, I do have a problem, and that is my device is not able to download it directly from Google Play, so I have to get the APK from XDA. I dunno why this is the case for my phone though. Is it because it's a 4.4.4? Either way, I'll get the APK moved to my phone later tonight. Teodor Axel Johan Jönsson I have activated hide root option, and it passes SafetyNet, but in Google Play Store, it still shows uncertified. What app should I hide root from to get Play Store to show Certified? JATIN BANSAL As per XDA: Q: Safety Net fails after enabling MagiskHide A: Magisk can only hide Magisk core features, for Magisk modules it depends on what the module does. If your ROM itself is not able to pass SafetyNet, then there is nothing Magisk can help. Your best bet is 100% stock ROMs, because your phone manufacturer is forced to release a device passing CTS. Teodor Axel Johan Jönsson What in Magisk Hide did you check/how did you do it? Google Play Store? Or Play services? Because here it says uncertified :( JATIN BANSAL Just clear app data of play store. Now it will show your device certified Teodor Axel Johan Jönsson Thanks! Muzaffar I believe that root and custom rom makes android what it is now. This feels like betrayal for Android enthusiast. username_not_valid Well maybe in the very early days (maybe), but not any more. Rooted phones make up a tiny fraction of active devices. Muzaffar It's not about active devices. It's about how android develop together with community (well as i remember) I believe that those "rooted user" contribute many things that make android right now. I still remember status bar (and nav bar) color change was implemented on Kitkat before it becomes official on lollipop. Also, we can't forget how badly mobile active network bug happens in lollipop if it's not those "rooted user" who found out the fix via xposed. and i believe there are still more. trparky We can blame the OEMs for that kind of stuff because of things like locked bootloaders, eFuses, etc. username_not_valid Or we can blame ROM makers for it because they kept breaking the devices causing warranty claims. Naxx ENVY no offence but that's small thinking ... i'd say 90% of people on Android devices don't want or even know about root, heck it may even be 95% ... security is more of a concern, sure it annoys us geeks, but that's the 5% at most. Muzaffar And about half of android devices is left outdated. Not to mention bugs that unsolved on previous android. I'll pick a dumb phone instead, if android becomes a closed platform. trparky And truth be told that's why I have an iPhone. I simply got sick and tired of the lack of updates so I told myself I'm going to the iPhone and have been happy ever since. OK sure, it may not have all of the customization features that Android has but I can be guaranteed that I will get software and security updates on time, every time, regardless of my carrier of choice. refthemc I think you misread his comment, he's saying that root and custom roms got Android to where it is TODAY not saying that it is necessary TODAY. And I agree. trparky It pretty much comes down to this. Google is simply targeting a much larger piece of the pie. You can't blame them for trying to do what is necessary to protect not only the platform but the Android brand itself. Qwip Well, it isn't like there is anywhere else to go though, is it? Google can basically throw enthusiasts who have promoted and fostered android development under the bus - they don't need them any more. trparky Money trumps community. Always has, always will. username_not_valid Ad blocking was the last holdout reason to root for me, but even thats no longer a good reason with things like Adhell, Adguard etc I have no other reason to root now, custom ROMs are generally garbage, and bloat can usually be uninstalled or disabled, so its just not needed. Adonis K. custom ROMs have nothing to do with root... thevigilante Custom ROMs have uncertified flag in Play Store Mike Avellanosa Not all, though George Byers My Nexus 7 2013 is passing safteynet running Lineage unrooted. Wilton Daniel Pinto Let me guess, you have a Pixel. Or you wouldn't call custom ROMs bloated while the reality is other way round username_not_valid Wouldn't touch a Pixel actually. username_not_valid Should be noted that I didn't call custom ROMs bloated, I guess you misread it. Wilton Daniel Pinto Oh yeah, I misread it . My bad Zach Mauch This is going to cause the same problem I see in governments work with security. They will blindly block things like root and bootloader unlock regardless of if it poses any credible threat because it FEELS more secure. Blah!!!!!! Naxx ENVY it IS more secure, not just " feels" h4rr4r More secure for them, not for me the owner of the device. Besides, not even for them in the long term. An up to date ROM has many exploits patched that a two versions out of date and 12 months behind on security patches OTA has. Zach Mauch What I mean is they will apply restrictions because they easily can and it gives a warm fuzzy for them. They will do this regardless of the impact to the user. The analogy here is that in my job I am constantly unnecessary restrictions and bureaucracy that make doing my job much more difficult. For instance, we are disallowed from using remote desktop on standalone computer networks. It would make our job MUCH MUCH easier in many circumstances and save money on software as I could remote into my PC from anywhere in the building. Yet they deny us that and claim security. jonzey231 So this will force people to install apps from unauthorized sources, thus making the whole Android malware issue that much more prevalent. Great.. Suicide_Note Unless being held at gunpoint, no one is forced to install apps from unauthorized sources. That's a user's CHOICE. jonzey231 You know what I mean. Stop playing devil's advocate on everyone's posts. Eric Braun He's not incorrect. Kyle R Krcmaric "Stop providing an alternate viewpoint to my own." It's just comments. Anyway, I think Google also announced that even sideloaded apps will get scanned by their new Google Play Protect service, which may help nullify the risk of sideloading in the first place. d0x360 That's not an alternate viewpoint unless your view is "don't install any apps ever" There is no logical argument to defend this move by Google. None. username_not_valid Yes there is. Come content creators will not allow a provider to support a rooted or otherwise compromised device. Right or wrong in your eyes thats the reality, and in order for Android to be able to have such services Google have to do this. d0x360 What you said isn't an alternate viewpoint lol you are just repeating the reason Google is doing this which everyone agrees is a fact. As for this new comment...a rooted phone isn't compromised. Tell me...what would a rooted user do with Netflix that would make Netflix want to block them? Are they worried about people copying movies because if they think Android is the vector for that action they are idiots. All they are doing is making a problem by allowing bad actors to inject malware into a Netflix apk that could be installed by both root and unrooted users. Genius! Give me 1 good reason to block rooted phones from an app like oh I dunno, Mario run or whatever it's called. Any answers you give are false. Wanna know why? Hacked apks exist to allow cheating and they can be installed by anyone rooted or not. In fact I'd stake my life that your average unrooted user is installing more modified apk files to cheat in games or whatever than any rooted user. People who root are generally better educated about the Android eco system and do less dumb stuff. As for Netflix I cancelled my account on the day they did this and now I just use a friends account so they lost a subscriber due to this move and I rarely ever used the app. Sure 1 person closing an account that's existed since the day they opened isn't going to do much but I vote with my wallet and if a company does something I dislike then they simply don't get my money. The first person I asked gave me their login info and I made a profile. It's just like how I share my HBO subscription with someone else. Easy easy. username_not_valid See my previous comment. Its not for me to argue, the fact is content providers want it, fair or not, end of story, therefore its going to happen. The tiny number of rooters out there are meaningless to them, and Google. Netflix has to do this because the providers of its non-original content demand it. Its not Netflix fault, they either do it or lose shows. Losing large amounts of their content would affect their subscription base several orders of magnitude more than losing rooted users, who chances are, use the service on more than their phone or tablet anyway. d0x360 Once again I ask... what about a rooted device is dangerous to an app and also this is now a second question, what makes it compromised? BAlGaInTl Clearly you've made up your mind on the issue, but I'll give it a go. It isn't necessarily the root that is dangerous to an app or vice versa. The compromise comes from other apps/processes that can take advantage of root. If you don't understand that, then you don't understand what root really is. It has a lot of valuable uses, but it can also be dangerous. To address your previous statement, just because it rubs me the wrong way. So your "solution" was to cancel your Netflix account and then steal the content? So clearly, you aren't "actually" affected by the change, because you can still watch Netflix. You do realize that watching their content is also valuable to them and makes them money? If you want to boycott Netflix for their practices, then by all means do. Otherwise, it just comes across as hypocritical IMHO. d0x360 I don't believe I asked you. No I'm not stealing Netflix content, it's being paid for and Netflix has many times in the past encouraged account sharing. Of course they did so in the hopes you would join but they still allow it. I paid my Netflix dues. Day 1 4 disc member, then as soon as it was available I upgraded to the 4k 4 user package. It's not piracy either, I'm not recording or distributing the content. If Netflix wants to dick with me I'll dick with them. I never said this was permanent but I vote with my wallet. Vote cast. I also haven't used Netflix once since that day despite being able to. I've been using Amazon and Microsoft video where I own over 500 movies so you can stuff the whole theft argument. I've bought more content than most and that doesn't include my DVD, Blu-ray, and uhd Blu-ray collection which is well over 1400 movies and TV shows at this point. Your right...I've been rooting since the first Android phone but I totally don't understand the possibilities. My argument is simple. The overwhelming majority of root users don't mess with apps. To hell with that nonsense argument anyways. What is the danger to Netflix? Copying movies? Please...it's a million times easier to do it on a PC. Even windows xp can handle it without issue. Does Netflix and you I suppose really think root users are using the app to steal content? If so how? Show me one forum topic, one article, one modified Netflix apk that allows downloading and bypassing their drm. I'm begging you. Just 1. BAlGaInTl I reviewed the Netflix TOS, and I will agree that you are not stealing. I'll even remove the verbiage from my post. Netflix does not make any such stipulation. They speak only of the "Account Owner" and "Devices." I guess I just assumed that, and that's my bad. As I've said in other posts... It isn't all about Netflix. A large part of it is about their content. They really can't argue that point with providers. You either play by their rules, work to establish new rules, or choose not to carry them. Netflix wants to stay relevant on all platforms. That's the main danger to Netflix. In addition, I shouldn't have to give an example in the wild of an exploit. Just because it is difficult to find doesn't mean it doesn't exist. What if someone else writes an app that uses root to mine user account data from Netflix? Should Netflix not be worried about protecting user data? If that happens, who is responsible for the security and the bad press? Probably not Netflix, but they would certainly be impacted. I checked my app really quick (which is stuck on version 4 because I'm affected). Since Netflix keeps you logged in for convenience (that's spelled out in their terms), a quick look gives my full name, username, phone number, zip code, the brand of payment card, and the last 4 digits of that card. That's quite a bit of information that can easily be gathered by a piece of Malware. Now as I said... Netflix probably wouldn't be liable if a user was compromised because of root. It would certainly be a danger to their business however. Why should the be asked to take that risk? It seems to me that they are approaching this in a realistic manner, and rolling it out in a reasonable way. Would this affect the majority of root users? Probably not. By their nature, root users will find ways around it anyway. The problem is that the impact to Netflix from losing content and/or a compromised app is disproportionate the loss of blocking root users. It's simply a numbers game, and you can't blame Netflix for that. And you certainly can't blame Google who is trying to improve security. username_not_valid Thats not for me to decide, or argue, the fact is the content providers have decided that rooting is a risk to their copyrighted content, and as such services like Netflix, Amazon, and other streaming services must comply and lock out rooted devices. Passing safetynet and using Googles DRM framework is the easiest way to claim due diligence, so thats what they will do, and in order to keep Android competitive Google is providing the tools needed to make it possible. What I will argue though is that your notion that custom ROMs etc are more secure is unfounded. The best might well be, but there are hundreds of completely random and unchecked ROMs out there that could contain absolutely anything, you cant possibly claim that custom ROMs are inherently safer or more secure than OEM ROMs, outdated or not. jonzey231 So let's play this out: If someone takes the Netflix .apk and mods it with malware and then signs it, it will pass installation on the device. 1. User opens app. 2. App does whatever shitty thing it's designed to do while the user thinks they just got around the block. 3. The OS scans the app and warns the user it's been modified and they should uninstall it. 4. User thinks "Ha! I know and that's why it works!" 5. User keeps app until they get a call from Credit Karma that their identity was probably stolen but they don't know how. 6. Person spends 6 months fixing stolen identity. But still uses that app the whole time. Ultimately, that user is still going to be screwed. Would you or I make this mistake? No. Would your cousin's friend's dad because he had his son root so he could tether for free and overheard you guys talking about sideloading apps and googled how to do it? Yes. Randroid Problem is, even in your scenario, root has nothing to do with it. Someone who is not rooted could do the same thing. The only problem is, now MORE people who root are going to be *forced* to look for a modified apk because the official apk is not available from the Play Store. So in the end, it's causing more problems than it's fixing. Corbin Baxter Here's the thing about rooting: when you alter your devices software like that, then Google shouldn't be responsible for anything that comes afterwards for the user. This just helps discourage rooting, which can alter a new users perspective on Android, or make someone reconsider getting an Android device. someone755 For what it's worth, back in 2011/2010, many of us bought into Android *because* we could root. Imagine the possibilities of being in control of so much more of your system than with any mobile OS prior; We've spent hundreds (some, thousands) of dollars in this environment, on devices, apps, books etc. I understand this isn't how things stand nowadays, but root is still prevalent because of one issue that Google will not fix (or at least, won't until O+ is running on the majority of devices, but that'll take two years at the minimum), and those are updates and vendor apps (i.e. bloatware). If my phone is stuck on Lollipop I'm going to root it; I'll be able to mitigate the memory leak performance drops, and overall customize the device to fit my specific needs -- I've made quite a few friends (think ROM and kernel devs) because I just wanted to put a thermal engine better than Qualcomm's horrendous MPDecision into the kernel directly (i.e. I took the kernel source and modified it to fit my needs). What Google is trying to do here is, yes, discourage rooting, but instead of fixing the root cause (heh) behind why people root in the first place (that is, again, customizability and personal(ized) performance tuning, in large part to keep devices on older Android versions alive), root wouldn't be necessary. In the long run this *might* fix the symptom, but it most definitely will not help in fixing the cause. And that's because the cause is Google itself. As if apps like Snapchat blocking power users from their apps wasn't enough, now there's this -- If it becomes so common that even Google's own apps start to utilize the feature, I'll be gone to another mobile platform within a month. That might mean iOS, it might mean S60v3, I'll know that if (or rather, when) it happens. tl;dr: Google is putting a band-aid on a shotgun wound. Corbin Baxter I'm speaking mainly for new Android users. They don't feel as comfortable rooting. Doing this makes Android SEEM more like iOS. This doesn't MAKE Android like iOS. New users are comfortable with that. This is the same issue Microsoft had with Windows 8/8.1. Classic users, and Windows enthusiasts, hated someone changing the way they would use their computers. Microsoft introduced a different way of doing things, and to enthusiasts, it was bad, no matter how good it might be. Google's Project Treble should mostly fix the fragmentation problem, therefore giving Android users one less reason to root. To us enthusiasts, nothing can beat rooting, but it might not be the best solution to the problems Android has. Google seems intent on fixing the problems rooting tries to solve, but in a higher-quality and reliable way. No hard feelings😉 trparky They won't understand that, they're too blinded by their geek rose colored glasses. Corbin Baxter I don't expect everyone to understand, but I'll be happy if even a small handful understand what Google is doing here. Dmitri Smirnov > when you alter your devices software like that, then Google shouldn't be responsible for anything that comes afterwards for the user. As if right now Google or the OEMs are in any ways responsible for the malware or unpatched firmware vulnerabilities that stay this way for year. But yes, the users that root are the problem. Corbin Baxter For unrooted phones, yes Google and OEMs are very responsible. But after you root, Android loses most of its security and stability, and rooting is basically tinkering with core system files. Google doesn't have any control over what the user can or can't do after that. bekifft That wasn't even a devil's advocate, that was a straight up strawman. Frosted Butts Yes.. please tell me about all the Netflix alternatives i can install, that can legally stream from Netflix...... Right now, if i am rooted and want Netflix (a service i am paying for), i must go through 3rd party app stores to install the APK. There is no choice at all... R Firestone ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ Umm you have the choice to unroot your device. Maxr1998 ..which is a bad choice for many. d0x360 Yes you do except I rooted my device to make it MORE secure. Unrooting would make my device less secure than sideloading apps would. username_not_valid People can keep saying that, but the content providers have no way to know whether or not you have taken measures to secure your custom device, whereas if they go down this root they know its handled. BAlGaInTl "whereas if they go down this root they know its handled" I see what you did there. 😆😄 ...or just watch Netflix from Chrome! You could even do this from a Linux box with root! 😃 Suicide_Note Sure there is: unroot. Problem solved. neoKushan "I've solved this problem by creating 3 more problems - but it IS solved!" Eric Braun https://www.amazon.com/Netflix-Inc/dp/B005ZXWMUS Option C .. ?? h4rr4r A choice that is now more popular. dcdttu It's not so much about what a user chooses to do. It's about probability. The probability that sites are going to try to lure users into downloading malware-infected Netflix APKs from 3rd party sites is going to go up if you can't download it from a safe source in the first place. This is just like the fact that, if you don't give drug users a safe and clean place to shoot up, they're going to go do it somewhere else that's much more dangerous. Both of these scenarios are bad for society in general, no matter what the original intention was. kgptzac 1/10. Gotta try harder. Premsuraj How? Google Play Protect will still catch malicious apps makapav Yes but you're potentially making people venture through shady sites to get the APKs. Eric Braun Or to Amazons App store or Fdroid. The people going to shady sites are already going there, this isn't going to increase the traffic by any real amount. tehboogieman Are you sure that Google will continue allowing GPP for unlocked or rooted users going forward? Not to mention that it's not a silver bullet for 0days d0x360 It barely works as is. There are tons of apps that slip through every day. Krebs on security reports on them quite frequently. I don't trust Google's scanning of apps at all which is why I root. I can make my phone more secure and I can also image the device as often as I want so if something does happen it's fixed within 5 min. If I unroot then I lose the protection along with the backups. Premsuraj Custom ROMs and root can't protect from 0days either. And just out of curiosity how is root going to provide more security? If anything it makes the device less secure tehboogieman Nobody said root makes a device more secure. Blocking root users from downloading apps from the Play Store puts users at more risk since those users will be more inclined to sideload apps from sources that might not be as reliable as the Play Store. Premsuraj The only people who cares about this are the people who root. And those user's generally tend to be more knowledgeable about what kind of apps and app stores they can trust. ASYOUTHIA✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ And only <2% of users will do this to keep rooted. xxTheGoDxx Only the plus 50 - 100 Million users that have root: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=eu.chainfire.supersu ASYOUTHIA✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ You do realize that that's just downloads right? ...not active users. blindexecutioner I'm not mad. I continue to use things like magisk to help get around stuff like this. All this will do is encourage me to use unauthorized sources for offending apps if magisk ever stops working. There is a reason I use Android over iOS and it certainly isn't because the apps are better designed or whatever. brian. Magisk is a good way around this. However, I don't know how long this will last. I would think with security in mind and developers trying to monetize more, it will put pressure on Google to make SafetyNet get triggered much easier. Obviously, I don't have any way of knowing, but this could easily turn into a cat and mouse game more than it already is. Android Pay was first, other apps did it like Super Mario Run, which who cares, but now Netflix? Changes are coming, and it doesn't look good for the rooting community. D13H4RD2L1V3 I'm not sure if everyone gets why some of us went through the trouble of gaining SU access. Sure, maybe there's a few who went through all that trouble for nefarious purposes (and maybe that got regulatory bodies concerned to the point where Google even needed to consider this) but from my perspective at least, a lot of us gain Superuser access mainly to get features that we liked on other Android flavors, especially in the case of a build of Android that's very close to Google's vision. Such as the ability to hide the navbar at any time we wanted and also to gain theming support (which I feel should be added officially sooner rather than later because I absolutely hate how Google is making their already-bright UI even more eye-searing with even more white-colored elements, which also makes the benefits of OLED much less obvious). I wouldn't be as concerned if these features were pushed to AOSP soon, but as it stands, I feel that Google should probably think about making these features available soon. Marty Thank the bad apples for why you no longer have freedom. Jeremy ディリマ Would changing region firmware with Odin flag the SafetyNet check on Samsung mobiles? Soz if it's a stupid question a lot has changed since I last fiddled with Android Christopher Robert This was a long time coming. Once root user started using root to pirate software, and/or get around geo locks, instead of using it to add feature to their firmware or improve their devices performance, it was only a matter of time before it all got torn down. h4rr4r Get around geo locks? You mean have my device report the location I want it to report? Yeah, how terrible that I control what my computer does. dizel123 You still do. This doesn't affect that at all h4rr4r You said the justification for that was people using their devices for their own reasons in the way they liked. I was pointing out that this is a normal thing and not something that should be punished. Cuvis You don't need root to pirate. You never did. Marty Apple says, Thank you. h4rr4r Sounds like we need a new FREE platform. Maybe Amazon can use this to push their store. mxwp but will the Netflix from the Amazon App Store work on rooted phones? Curt RIP Root. I'm not moving from stock anymore, just cab with the hassle. Until there's a 'reliable' way to hide from Safety Net, I'll enjoy my Android Pay, banking apps and overall smoothness. (If it was up to me, I'd be rooted with Linage) h4rr4r IOS is the platform for you. That was the deal from the beginning. hp-fourtwenty magisk....giyf .y phone is rooted with lineage 14.1, and passes safetynet. problem solved! jcopernicus Fantastic news. Lawstorant All this butthurt for what? You all sound like Magisk doesn't exist. Dave Hamilton Lets take Apple and there closed source. Lets take Google and there open source, the freedom to do and change as you please to make the device yours. No two devices have to be the same. Lets get 115 million android users, and then start deciding you no longer have this choice and freedom to do what you want! When something gets better and better, its only a matter of time before all the things you love are removed and comersilised Eric Braun You still have the option to do what you want. However like everything there are reactions for every action. Want to root or unlock your device? Sure, however there may be a few apps that no longer appear in the playstore. May want to have a backup like Amazon App Store or something similar ready. No one is stopping you, feel free to do as you please. tehboogieman Man, if I have to choose between having a device with root or a device with apps that use day to day, the iPhone goes from a 1% chance of being my daily driver to about 50% There are still a lot that can Android can do that iOS can't, but if I'm living in a walled garden the iPhone is looking pretty attractive. 5+ years of official OS support, solid retail network for quick service or hardware exchanges. The Play Store is my main source of apps that I know are vetted and generally safe. I have no desire to manage app updates manually. There is always a chance that someone will build and maintain an appstore that will have all root blocked apps (maybe the future of APKMirror?). If not it might be the death of Android for users like me Eric Braun Even without all of this I would use an APKMirror App that allowed for updating of apps automatically. dizel123 Google gives app developers more control over their apps. Whiny entitled internet crybabies go on the internet and whine and cry. Aka...Thursday neoKushan Alternatively: Google restricts users from using their device, which they own, how they see fit. dizel123 Except Google isn't restricting anyone from doing anything. But being 100% wrong has never stopped anyone in the internet NubCake being an asshole (in your case) hasn't stopped anyone from commenting eather it seems. dizel123 I can admit to being an asshole. But I'm also right so it's all good. neoKushan It's certainly not stopping you. dizel123 I haven't experienced it so of course it's not stopping me trparky You may own the hardware but you don't own the software, you only have a license to use it. Csöpi Thats so greate. I have a stock oneplus one and for some strange reasons i was failing the test beforhand, but now its all green. Still cant update the netflix app hence chromecast isnt working either anymore. Not really happy. JC If there's a will there's a way. brian. If more developers get on board with this, I can't see why I would switch to Android. I've always been curious about new Android phones, bought a bunch and rooted them all if I could. This is not good for a person like me. d0x360 If Google keeps this up and app devs include the api to block rooted phones then my days using Android will be over and Google will have lost a user who's been there since the g1. I don't know what I'd switch to... probably windows mobile because I'm not a fan of apple whatsoever. It's really a shame because if I had to guess I'd say 99.99% of people who root do so for either the added security and or customized experiences. For example I use root to modify my status bar and quick panel as well as firewall my apps and use adaway and yes Google I do whitelist sites that aren't obnoxious with their ads. John Doe All the more reason for the APK mirror appstore LoL Jan-Lk Else Yeah Google want's us to buy tooooo expensive phones to just get the latest Android, because cheap phones suck at updates and so they need to be flashed and rooted... trparky But if the community raises holy hell with the OEMs then maybe it will be corrected. There's no damn reason why a three year old device can't be updated when an eight year old Windows 7 machine is still receiving Windows Updates. McStagger WHY DOES NETFLIX CARE IF THE PHONE IS ROOTED?!?!?!?! mxwp Netflix does not care, but the content creators that make the stuff you see on Netflix do care. They care because they are idiots who think it is easier to pirate from rooted phones. bekifft Again, Google becomes more and more restrictive. I switched from iPhone because the screens were too small, and Google was far less restrictive. Both of those issues are now resolved, and Google's upped the price of their device to match Apple. May as well switch back to iPhone, Google seems to support it just as much as Android anyway. Luxferro Except it's not just rooted users! Any device with an unlocked bootloader. hp-fourtwenty Your comment sucks for misinforming users about what safetynet is....has NOTHING to do with unlocked bootloaders. Luxferro Sure it does. My Nexus 6P only has an unlocked bootloader, and Netflix disappeared from the play store after the last update. And I'm not the only one, so I suggest you do some reading. TechGuy22 more reason for me to pirate hey, have at it Matías Duarte I hope Netflix does the same with Jailbroken iOS devices. Why they do this btw? To prevent people recording their movies? You can do that with Windows.. Knowledgeborn Allah In all honesty, that'll probably never happen. Jailbreaking iOS opens the doors to a lot of customization on an iPhone, but the security issues are often minimal (with the exception being not having the latest software version). Jailbreaking is pretty much filtered through the Cydia platform. You don't have access to the entire system with a jailbreak. Rooting is completely different, because you can completely reshape the core OS. fbl Note : I don't work for Netflix so I can't comment for them. Possible causes : - the right holders might be pushing for this. I work on roughly the same product area and we don't implement DRM because we like them, we implement them because we contractually have to. -Netflix is tired of getting low notes because of crashes coming by shitty hacks in custom roms. Zach Mauch Anyone know how chromebooks will be affected by this? Will dev mode being enabled cause you to fail SafetyNet Checks? That is currently the only way to install apks on Chromebooks. Branko But Android AOSP!11 -Google 2011 How the times how changed. Wayne Randall ALT arguement, because I don't have time to read every comment... This doesn't limit me and my rooted N6P at all, this move limits how much money they (the devs and Google) are going to make. I can't buy it (the app or coins, or special characters, or bonus content, w/e) if I can't see it. Plain and simple. The important apps will still be there. No app is worth unroot. Block Project Fi from root though... weeeellll. I guess I'd unroot for that. mxwp yeah, only Netflix, banks, and big names will use these blocks. i am guessing most devs want as much exposure as possible. PVL_93_RU Google is actively trying to kill the modding community. Not the Custom ROM makers, but people who root and install Xposed. All because they compromise the security for Android Pay I fear the day root and Xposed apps start disappearing from the Play Store trparky If it comes to security vs being open, security will always win (or at least should always win). Eric Koop I had my Shaw Gateway app update yesterday and they changed it so it doesn't work if rooted. So I had to uninstall and find an APK online of an older version. Now it's just a matter of time before I forget and re-install the update. What a pain... disqus_em5YfkbWdk Well this would certainly get me to cancel Netflix. My personal Plex server is far better than Netflix could ever be anyway. Vivek Rameses Becoming apple more and more every day. Disgusting. Knowledgeborn Allah Android is starting to look more and more like iOS with each update... ¯_(ツ)_/¯ trparky Open platforms rarely stay open once the Benjamins start rolling in. hp-fourtwenty Go ahead and block me...I'll just pirate your app. Play nice and so will I. Start poking me and I'll poke back by never giving you another penny. App devs can't beat XDA devs. It's not going to happen. My unlocked, rooted, rommed and modded device still passes safety net. The day that stops, so does the flow of money leaving my hands on the play store. Luxferro Lay off the sodas.... UniBroW Question, can those of you without access to Netflix on Google play, can it be installed from the Amazon App Store? Stanley C. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/dd381b7e8a39df74c4725712a0db906098c965e9ee4194b6e01e020fd69ee566.png Thats how magisk is made... Magic! Marti Abernathey Yawn. I've got a rooted device and just installed Netflix... because? Magisk. As soon as they made this choice I cancelled. Not because I can't get around it, but because they make me do that. mrjayviper even on a non-rooted LOS mis 5s+, I cannot install Netflix. unlocking the bootloader already tripped safety. And I don't want to root. The features available in non-rooted LOS is enough for me. Teh BuG No. Bueno. TedPhillips Sigh. What's the over-under on this becoming pervasive in the play store... MicroG / Fdroid I'm coming soon. World needs a solid single alternative gcm replacement to catch on. TedPhillips As far as the potential for support overhead, being rooted is generally less than the pain coming from the Xposed/magisk crowd. You need to be actively interfering with an app via root vs code being injected into low levels of the framework that everything uses. TedPhillips I think the best outcome could be that Google opens up their process for little guys to certify there own rom builds, ala let's encrypt lowering friction on getting ssl setup. AOSP should not be a functionally useless base implementation for I'm roms, but something you can use in​ practice. TedPhillips Hey guys, don't worry. Google says Android is for everyone. https://www.android.com/everyone/ That includes AOSP developers too, right? That website seems to tread the line pretty carefully, ala 'no one is forcing you use Google play' but Hiroshi's quote seems like it comes with a grain of salt since he owns Play. I'd love to see AP interview him about this. qkjDlav As an app developer for a large app used globally, the two biggest time wasters in a developer's life are a) debugging device specific issues (HTC, Samsung, etc) and b) crash logs with Xposed in the stack trace. Developers are tired of having to sit around with device farms at their desks just to make sure new features and changes work with each quirky variant of Android that manufacturers want to deploy, and custom roms do make it worse. Enthusiasts are welcome to customize their own versions of Android and sideload apps, but we don't want to see crashlogs in the Developer Console from rooted/custom ROM users. And companies probably don't want to keep paying us to debug issues that only a small minority of users will see. Lê Nguyên Chương Most stupid thing I've ever heard in my life.

How does Google Assistant stack up against Siri on an iPhone? Friday, 19 May 2017 (14 hours ago) Some of the biggest news to come out of Google I/O this week was that Google Assistant is coming to iOS, looking to take a shot at Siri, Apple’s own entrenched AI assistant. While Assistant has been available on Android for a while now, how does the AI assistant stack up against Siri when its forced to go head-to-head on Apple’s far more limited playing field? We put the two head-to-head. -Access- One of the most important parts of any AI assistant is how easy it is to access. One of the biggest selling points of Amazon’s Echo hardware is the always-listening feature that lets Alexa always be on hand to respond to any queries or commands. On Android, Assistant has deep, OS-level hooks that make it more more accessible and functional.

Build Apps 5x Faster For Half the Cost Enterprise Cloud Computing On Force.com AI and Machine Learning Take Center Stage at Google I/O 2017 By Shirley Siluk / NewsFactor Network PUBLISHED: MAY 19 2017 At last year's Google I/O developer conference, CEO Sundar Pichai described how the world was shifting from mobile-first to one led by artificial intelligence (AI). This year, the company is focusing on "making AI work for everyone," he said. Now in its final day, this year's event has highlighted Google's increasing use of AI and machine learning for everything from email to job-hunting to healthcare. The company's latest initiatives even include one that uses machine learning to design better machine learning. During the event, Google also unveiled the second generation of its tensor processing units (TPUs), chips custom-designed for machine learning. The new cloud TPUs will be made available to developers and researchers via Google's Compute Engine, with an alpha program for users set to kick off sometime in the future. Immersive Computing for Everyone Google also continues to work on advancing its capabilities in augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR), and investing in platforms that will make them more accessible to a wider audience, according to VR/AR vice president Clay Bavor. "In order for immersive computing to be 'for everyone,' developers need to build great apps and experiences," Bavor wrote yesterday in a blog post. "We're working on tools and tech to help them do that." A new tool called Instant Preview, for example, is designed to let developers using VR headsets see the results of programming changes they make "in seconds, not minutes," Bavor said. Another tool coming soon, Seurat, is aimed at helping mobile developers achieve high-fidelity, real-time scenes and graphics that are equal to or better than those on desktops, he said. And this summer, Google will launch Chrome VR, which will enable users of the mobile VR platform Daydream to browse the Web in virtual reality. The tech giant also released an experimental build of its open-source Chromium browser with an API for augmented reality. Smarter, Faster Gmail Replies More commonly used Google apps are also becoming increasingly smart. For instance, the company announced Wednesday that its Smart Reply feature for Gmail will begin rolling out over the next two weeks for Android and iOS mobile devices. It will be available first in English, with Spanish rolling out in the coming weeks and more languages to follow. Smart Reply offers three response suggestions based on the content of an individual email message. A user can either tap one of the options to send it immediately, or select a response to edit it before sending. "Smart Reply utilizes machine learning to give you better responses the more you use it," Gmail software engineer Greg Bullock wrote on the G Suite blog. "So if you're more of a 'thanks!' than a 'thanks.' person, we'll suggest the response that's, well, more you!" Over the coming weeks, Google also plans to launch a new Google for Jobs feature that will incorporate AI into its Search function to make it easier for employers and job seekers to make better-focused matches. During today's final day of Google I/O, the schedule includes sessions on how to push the boundaries of machine learning, how to apply "built-in hacks of conversation" to voice-based user interfaces, and how to use behavioral insights to boost user retention. The 2017 Google I/O developer conference -- or festival, as the company likes to call it -- has been running May 17 - 19, at the Shoreline Amphitheatre in Mountain View, California.

USA TODAY Google CEO Sundar Pichai delivers the keynote address at the Google I/O 2017 Conference (Photo: Justin Sullivan, Getty Images) 1586 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORE NEW YORK — The next version of Google’s Android operating system, what’s merely known now as “Android O,” still doesn’t have a full name — I’m betting the snack-themed successor to Nougat will eventually carry the “Oreo” moniker. But at a Google I/O developer conference otherwise heavy on enhancements to the artificial intelligence-infused Google Assistant, Google Photos and Google’s vision for augmented and virtual reality, the company spelled out more details for O, from longer battery life to improved notifications. Google even announced its intention to bestow some Android love to entry-level phones. Current versions of Android software are on 2 billion active smartphones and tablets, making it by far the most dominant OS for such devices. For now, O is still a work in process, released as a beta best in the hands of developers. Versions for the rest of us should come in the summer. Google I/O: Here are the big changes coming to Google Google I/O exclusive: Google to launch Google for Jobs to help Americans find work Here are some of the features and enhancements you can expect when O software does become available: Picture in picture. This is one of the so-called “fluid experiences” coming to O devices. You’ll be able to watch, say, a YouTube video or Netflix in a small window while you’re simultaneously multitasking in some other app. You can even use the smaller window for a video call. When done, you just can swipe the window away. Apple has a similar feature in iOS for some iPads. Notification dots. If an app on your phone has an associated notification, you’ll see a dot on the icon to indicate as much. You can then pull down a shade from the top of the screen to peek at the notification or press down on the app icon to view the notification in place. This may also remind you of a feature in iOS on Apple devices with pressure-sensitive displays. Autofill. We’re all familiar with autofill on computers, that is having the PC automatically fill in your name, address, credit card info and so on. This "opt-in" feature is coming to apps on O devices. The promise, of course, is that it will be simpler to log in and set up such phones and apps. Get more like this delivered to your inbox: Sign up for the weekly Talking Tech newsletter.  Better copy and paste. The last of the fluid experience that Google highlighted at I/O is an improved copy and paste feature based on machine learning. The idea is you won’t have to drag handles to highlight everything you want to copy — you can instead tap just once on names, phone numbers and addresses, and Google automatically highlights those items. Vitals. Collectively, these are the enhancements that are meant to improve your phone’s battery life, startup time and performance, stability and security. For example, Google says it scans more than 50 billion apps daily on every connected Android device. If it finds a harmful app, Google disables or removes it. To make this more visible to the end user, Google announced what it calls Google Play Connect, which will let you know that the apps on your phone are A-OK , or presumably if on the other hand they might cause trouble. Android for the entry level. Typically the latest operating systems are earmarked for the most powerful phones. Google, however, doesn’t want O to just be for state of the art devices. But Google previewed a variant it calls Android Go that aims to tune a good seamless Android experience for the most affordable O phones, those with lesser components and/or memory. Go includes a rebuilt set of Google’s own apps that require less memory, storage and mobile data, as well as a special Google Play Store that highlights the apps that will work better on such entry-level phones (though all the other Android apps will apparently be available as well.). Android Go is being designed for O phones with one gigabyte or less of memory, down to 512 megabytes. As part of this effort, Google mentioned a version of YouTube called YouTube Go for users with limited data connectivity. For one thing, it will give you a sneak peak of a video you’re thinking about watching before you decide, Google says, to spend your data to actually watch it. You can also save videos while connected to watch when you can’t later tap into data. And you'll be able to share such videos when you’re offline. Google has not specified if or how well the Google Assistant might function on such Android Go phones or whether the newly announced Google Lens camera technology that can identify objects will work.

The new app, which supports glide typing, lets users search straight from the keyboard, using normal Google search. Once the information is found, user can send it into their application without leaving the keyboard, technewsworld.com reported. No matter what application a user is using, SMS, email, WhatsApp or messenger, the Google logo is always present in the keyboard. “It’s like having a google search in any app, right from the keyboard . . . so we called it a Gboard,” said Google in a video posted in its YouTube account. “Solutions like Google’s Gboard and glide typing are designed to simplify and speed up common tasks. That can be a real boon when you’re under time pressure or are trying to create a complex message on a keyboard of limited size,” Principal Analyst at Pund-IT Charles King was quoted as saying in the same report. Emojis can be searched easily in the search bar. Typing words like “angry,” “pizza,” “cat,” and “car,” user can see all the relevant emoji characters in an instant. In addition, the application can be customized depending to the user’s liking. The user has the option to unable the glide typing, toggle things like auto-correction, auto-capitalization, enable caps lock, among others. Right now, Gboard app is only available in the United States and company has yet to announce when it will be available to download elsewhere.

The biggest piece of this is the news that, using machine learning, Google said that it now scans more than 50 billion apps every day to hunt for risks and potentially harmful code. Automated remediation is also part of the enhancement. “Whether you’re checking email for work, playing Pokémon Go with your kids or watching your favorite movie, confidence in the security of your device and data is important,” said Edward Cunningham, product manager for Android Security, in a blog. “Play Protect is built into every device with Google Play, is always updating, and automatically takes action to keep your data and device safe, so you don’t have to lift a finger.” Google has also implemented a “Find My Device” feature (something Apple has had for iPhone for quite some time), which allows users to locate, ring, lock and erase Android devices remotely—including phones, tablets and watches.   The news comes after several instances of bad apps showing up in Google Play. For instance, HummingWhale, a new variant of the HummingBad malware, was found hiding in more than 20 apps on Google Play in January; the infected apps were downloaded several million times by unsuspecting users before the Google Security team removed them. Similarly, The FalseGuide malware was found in April to be infesting 40+ guide apps in the Google Play store; these were uploaded to the app store as early as November 2016, meaning they hid successfully for five months, accumulating an alarming 2 million infected users. “All Google Play apps go through a rigorous security analysis even before they’re published on the Play Store—and Play Protect warns you about bad apps that are downloaded from other sources too,” Cunningham said. “Play Protect watches out for any app that might step out of line on your device, keeping you and every other Android user safe.” Why Not Watch? 6 Nov 2014The Fappening and Snappening Exposed: Implications for the Information Security Industry 18 May 2017How to Get Smart About Prevention 28 Nov 2013Creating a Mobile Security Action Plan... 10 Mar 2016Out Think Mobile Malware - Learn How to Protect Your Mobile Devices Related to This Story Apple fixes 41 flaws in iTunes Stagefright Returns?

By Michael Simon Staff Writer, PCWorld | May 19, 2017 11:36 AM PT Credit: Google More like this Master the many ways to search with Google on your Android phone Google Lens: 6 things we can't wait to try Google I/O 2017: What to expect from this year's developer's conference Video Computex 2015: Asus ZenWatch 2 could have 4-day battery If Google I/O 2017 had a tagline, it might be something like “Rise of the Machine Learning.” The biggest thread throughout the keynote was an aggressive push to fully move from a mobile-first world to an AI-first world, changing the way we use Google and our devices to look at everything around us. It used to be about algorithms, but now it’s about artificial intelligence. Google doesn’t simply want to be the tool we use in our browsers to find something, it wants to be within reach whenever we have a question, whether or not we’re even looking at a screen. We already see it with Google Assistant on Google Home, but now Google is starting to pull search out of our phones and apps in order to make it accessible everywhere. But that also means changing our expectations. Where now we still need to explicitly ask Google to search for something, the new AI push will use our cameras, calendars, and favorite apps to deliver information where and when we need it, even if we don’t precisely know what we’re looking for.  And in some instances, we might not even need to ask a question. Seeing is believing The only real new product Google unveiled at I/O was Google Lens. It’s not a separate app but rather an underlying platform that supercharges the way our phones integrate with their cameras and our photos. It’s kind of like Google Goggles meets Samsung’s Bixby, with a little augmented reality mixed in for good measure. Google Google Lens knows what it’s looking at and can tell you all about it. And if it works as well as Google says it will, it could dramatically change the way we use search. Instead of opening Google Translate and typing a bit of text into a search field, you’ll be able to point your phone’s camera at the text, and Translate will work its magic. It’s likely similar to the way the Google Translate app uses Word Lens to instantly decipher text—so this is less about introducing a new feature, and more about making something dead simple so we’ll regularly use it. And eventually it may work for everything else we see, too. Snap a picture of a flower and Google Lens will tell you what species it is—and from there you can use Assistant to learn more about it. This distills all the steps (and time) of a laborious image search down to a single simple action. We’re still Googling, but we’re barely thinking about it. Home is where the search is The Google Home desktop speaker is already a perfect way to limit our reliance on our phones without reducing our dependency on search (and Google in general). But now Home stands to become a true hub for our digital lives. The big new feature is hands-free calling—which would have been much splashier had Amazon not unveiled the same thing last week with the Echo Show. Fear not, though, because Google is also giving Home more responsibility for organizing our lives. Google Now Google Home can tell you if there’s something you need to know before you ask. A new feature called Proactive Assistant will rummage through your schedule and reminders to let you know if you’re forgetting something. So if there’s heavy traffic and you have to pick up your kid from soccer practice, Google Home will search through your calendar and traffic reports to let you know you should probably leave a little early. It’s not too intrusive either. The spinning circle of lights at the top of the device will alert you to the notifications. From there, you can say, “Hey Google, what’s up,” and it’ll tell you what it found. Down the line, I could see it extending to other Google Now On Tap services, like breaking news stories and sports updates, and maybe even third-party apps. Granted, it could all get a little too overbearing if Google isn’t judicious about what Google Home delivers, so there needs to be a balance between what’s useful and what’s overkill. But there’s a real opportunity to add a new dimension to search in a way that anticipates our needs, and delivers timely and relevant content like a true assistant should. Personal touch The mobile-first world that Google is transitioning away from isn’t just driven by traditional search. It’s also driven by apps. Our phones are filled with dozens, nay hundreds of apps that we only need to open a few times a month. And Google is looking to Assistant as the primary way to access all of that information without actually needing to open or even download the apps. Google With Transactions, you’ll be able to search, order, and pay for things through Google Assistant. First, Google is bringing Google Home actions to phones. And with a screen, you’ll not only be able to talk to your apps through Assistant, but also interact with them in some new, fresh ways. Tasks like ordering food and accessing recipes can be swiftly done through Google Assistant, and like Google Lens, it dramatically cuts down on the time needed to accomplish these tasks. Once you’ve told Assistant to access a specific app, Assistant will use the database to retrieve whatever you ask it. And soon that will extend to transactions as well, letting us buy products or order food just by asking. Developers can leverage Assistant to create an end-to-end ordering process that walks you through the whole transaction, from searching for something, to customizing your order, to checking out. And if it works as advertised, it will take a fraction of the time it takes now, without ever logging into a website or opening an app. Google everywhere Google’s new AI push isn’t about phones or apps or even Android. It’s about bringing Google everywhere it isn’t and using Assistant to fill in the gaps. It’s not a move away from mobile per se, but rather a way to make Google more versatile and expansive as we evolve away from traditional search. Google Soon we won’t need a bar to search for something. But it’s still powered by the two main things that propelled Google to such astronomical heights: speed and accuracy. The three-pronged attack of Google Lens, Home, and Assistant will simultaneously expand our use of search and cut down the time we need to spend with it by delivering prompt, targeted responses. And pretty soon we won’t need to open Chrome or tap a bar to find out about something. Google will just be there whenever we need it.

Name: Subject: Message: The maker of the Ticwatch 2 is making a Google Assistant speaker Newsby Kris Carlon12 hours ago 71 2 Among the many new Google Assistant hardware partners announced at I/O, one stands out. Mobvoi, the maker of the Ticwatch 2, will be the first Chinese company to produce an Assistant-equipped device. This is notable because, as you know, Google isn’t exactly popular in China. The Tichome Mini is a muffin-top version of Google Home, an ultra-portable, small circular speaker disc that is battery-powered to boot. There’s no pricing or release information available yet, but it will be coming to the US later this year. While it will feature full Assistant support, I wouldn’t be surprised if it loses its always-listening abilities when it is running on battery power. If this partnership seems a little odd – tapping a Chinese company to make products that won’t work properly in China – it’s actually not that strange. Mobvoi has already enjoyed a successful partnership with Google on Android Wear, bringing the first Android Wear device to China in the form of the Moto 360, and again more recently on the Ticwatch 2. In its home country of China, where Google Play Services are blocked, Android Wear’s voice recognition, AI and natural language understanding are all taken care of by Mobvoi. This not only demonstrates a high level of competency, but also of trust from Google. Google actually owns a minority stake in Mobvoi, so we can expect to see more partnerships like this in years to come. Whether this means Assistant might one day get the same Mobvoi treatment as Wear in order to deliver it to the Chinese market, we’ll just have to wait and see. In the meantime, those in the US will soon have a lot more Assistant hardware options on hand, most of which hopefully won’t look quite so much like an air freshener.

The Data' Shows How People Drew the Same Concepts By: Joey Haar - May 19, 2017 References: quickdraw.withgoogle & theverge A few months ago, Google released a program called 'Quick, Draw!' that trained a neural network to recognize human drawings through the guise of a fun interactive game, and now Google has updated the game's website to 'Quick, Draw! The Data' in order to open source some of the company's findings. The Quick, Draw! game was simple on its face. The site would post a random word (usually a concrete object or simple concept,) and users had 20 seconds to draw that word. The aim of the game was to get Google's neural network to recognize the image within the time limit. Quick, Draw! went viral, and Google subsequently collected millions of drawings of hundreds of words. Quick, Draw! The Data lays out all those drawings, organized by word. Clicking through, users can see a sped up animation of the exact lines that people drew as they played, giving a thorough and enlightening picture of how people interpret words and concepts visually.

Google Home Home was only launched 6 months ago and Google happily announced that they have already added 15 new features since launch.  With a Google Home at your disposal you can now do the following with ease: voice order shopping step by step instructions for cooking play your favorite song by using lyrics… schedule a meeting set reminder hands free calling coming to home Users will be able to ask their assistant to make a free personalised call. Google Home Products VP, Rishi Chandra didn’t say exactly when the feature will launch or whether there are any limitations on the free calls. Home can have up to 6 different users on one device and if asked to ‘call Mum’ it will call the correct persons Mum depending on who is asking. Google will be enabling Bluetooth on all Home devices Bluetooth support to all existing home devices – any audio from ios or android  meaning anyone with an iOS, Android, or any Bluetooth-supported device can stream audio from the handset directly to Google Home. Say what you want to watch and Home will play it for you: Spotify, Soundcloud, Deezer, Youtube music, Googleplay music, Tunein, iheartradio, Youtube, Netflix, Googlephotos, hbonow, hulu, youtube tv, to name a few. Visual responses: Bring up google maps when you say lets go, as long as you have a destination already planned. Ok Google, show my calendar for Saturday…  The assistant will send the information for you to view on any chosen linked screen. Whats the weather going to be like in X location: Assistant will bring up the weather on screen based on the information given. Ask Google to show your ‘Watch later’ list and the answer is almost instantaneous in response and visual representation. To summarise, Home now offers Proactive assistance, Hands-free calling, Your Favorite Entertainment and Visual responses. Google Lens Google Lens is a set of vision based computing capabilities that can understand what you are looking at and help you take action. This could well be one of the most useful innovations to come along for a while. Lens is like a catalyst between you the user, the internet and the real world. The outcome of this is an instant answer or action relating to your World. For example, you are walking along and notice a flower that you do not recognise. Apart from digging up the plant and replanting in your own garden there is little way of growing one yourself without knowledge of its name or a background in Horticulture. No problem, Google Lens it! Pretty amazing right? It does not stop there either. With Google Lens, the assistant will give you options depending on what you are capturing in the frame. See a sign for a concert? Lens it and Google may ask you if you want to book tickets? Perhaps set a scheduled event for an hour before the concert to make sure you are there on time? All this from simply viewing through Google Lens. Visiting a friend and you are not on their WiFi yet? No problem: Google Lens it!    There seems to be a lot of confusion out there across the seas of the internet over exactly what Lens is. One thing it is not is augmented reality. It is an AI tool enhanced through deep learning. It will also, quite possibly, be one of the most exciting advances in technology this year!

Click to Skip Ad Closing in... Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Apps & Software These are the best Google Assistant features that Siri can’t match Image Source: Dudley Carr Chris Mills @chrisfmills May 19th, 2017 at 2:27 PM Share Tweet Earlier this week, Google finally put the Google Assistant onto iPhones. For the first time, Apple fanboys can use Google’s AI to perform a bunch of tricks, but much more importantly, it means we can finally have a Google Assistant vs Siri showdown. This isn’t a fair fight on several counts: Google’s been doing AI for much longer and has more data to mine; but Siri’s also the built-in AI, which gives her access to far more of the iPhone’s functions. But despite blatant Apple favoritism for Siri, Google Assistant can still pull a bunch of tricks that Siri can only dream of. Don't Miss: Exclusive: The world’s first look at Apple’s final iPhone 8 design in real life Written conversations The first feature you’re likely to notice is that you can type questions to Google Assistant. If, like me, you’d never be seen dead talking to your phone in public, this is a genuinely game-changing feature. It lets you use all the smarts of Google without needing to say actual words in public and have everyone around you judging your movie choice. Written queries get treated exactly the same as spoken things: you can write in natural speech, so things like “set an alarm for 7” or “what’s the weather like today” keeps working just fine. Contextual answers Another of Google’s neat features is that it remembers what you’re talking about. For example, you can ask “Who directed Batman Begins,” and then immediately follow up with “show me pictures of him,” and it’ll bring up images of Christopher Nolan. It goes a long way towards making the Google Assistant feel like a real person, not some kind of information-fetching bot or an enhanced version of Google. Google will even suggest a lot of these follow-up features to you. Once I’d asked about Christopher Nolan, it provided a bunch of prompts like “Images” and “Movies,” which you can tap to get more info. It feels a lot like the information cards that Google serves up when you do an internet search, but easier to access. Flight status You can ask Google “What’s the status of Delta flight 361 to Atlanta,” and it’ll give you info directly within the app without kicking you out to a web page. Siri’s not even close — as with many things, if you ask it for a flight status, it’ll do a web search and give you the top pages. Even when Google can’t give you precise flight status, it still gives useful info. For example, I tried asking “What’s the status of the Delta flight from Charlotte to Wilmington,” it sent me to a web page for Wilmington airport, with Airline:Delta and Origin:Charlotte already filled in. Bots Google has opened up the Assistant’s natural-language-processing to a bunch of third-party companies. One of the better ones is Genius, the music recognition and recommendation database. Ask the Assistant “I’d like to talk to Genius,” and you get a new conversation specifically with the Genius bot. From there, you can type in a couple of lyrics, and it’ll tell you what song you’re listening to and information about it. In many ways, I actually prefer it to Shazam or other services that listen to a sound clip. Quite often, I’m in a bar where a music recognition service won’t work, but I can make out snippets of lyrics. Typing that straight into the Assistant is a little easier than doing a Google search, and gives better results. Shopping list This is a little unfair, because both Google Assistant and Siri do have a shopping list feature. But Google’s is much faster and slicker to use, and syncs to a dedicated Shopping List that’s tied to your Google account, and you can easily manage from multiple devices. Way more importantly, though, Google Assistant doesn’t just keep the shopping list as another list. When you browse to the list in the Home app (or just ask Google Assistant “shopping list,”) you get the option to shop your list using Google Express. You can view the list, browse item options, and then checkout all without leaving the app, or really feeling like you’re doing anything. Where Siri still wins There’s one big caveat to all this, though: Google Assistant requires you to open up an app before you can use it. Siri can be activated by your voice or by pressing the home button, which takes seconds off the process every time you use it. Sure, Google’s voice recognition is much better, and it syncs with all your Google accounts, but that doesn’t really matter if you don’t use it. While Siri remains the only option for the native voice assistant on the iPhone — and I don’t see Apple changing that any time soon  — the Assistant is still going to be second-best.

The system, called Google Play Protect, aims to improve Android device security by constantly updating apps and automatically taking steps against any suspicious activity uncovered by the scans. Google Play Protect, which was announced at the Google I/O 2017 conference this week in Mountain View, Calif., runs automatically in the background of Android devices and manually starting a scan is an available option. "With more than 50 billion apps scanned every day, our machine learning systems are always on the lookout for new risks, identifying potentially harmful apps and keeping them off your device or removing them," wrote Android security product manager Edward Cunningham in a blog post. "All Google Play apps go through a rigorous security analysis even before they're published on the Play Store -- and Play Protect warns you about bad apps that are downloaded from other sources too." Android apps in the Google Play Store have long been plagued by malware and other malicious actors, and despite efforts to mitigate these threats, Android remains a target for attackers. Google Play Protect is a larger scale effort that uses machine learning technology to look for harmful apps. Google Play Protect builds off of Google's previous app scanning tool Verify Apps, but it now plays a more significant role in Google Play. Google also included Find My Device as part of the Play Protect release, which enables users to locate, lock or erase their Android devices if they're lost or stolen. Google Cloud IoT Core In another step forward, Google announced its new internet of things (IoT) management service for enterprises called Cloud IoT Core, which aims to give businesses a better way to manage IoT devices and process the abundance of data generated by those devices. "Cloud IoT Core, using Cloud Pub/Sub underneath, can aggregate dispersed device data into a single global system that integrates seamlessly with Google Cloud data analytics services," Google said in a post, adding that the data collected from IoT devices can be used for advanced analytics, visualization, machine learning and more to "improve operational efficiency, anticipate problems and build rich models that better describe and optimize your business." Cloud IoT Core's two main components are the device manager and the protocol bridge. The device manager configures the individual devices and offers a console management option. According to Google, the device manager is designed to verify the identity of an IoT device and authenticate it for connections, as well as allow administrators to remotely control the device from the new cloud service. The protocol bridge connects endpoints for protocols and offers automatic load balancing for all connections. "The protocol bridge has native support for secure connection over MQTT, an industry-standard IoT protocol," Google stated. "The protocol bridge publishes all device telemetry to Cloud Pub/Sub, which can then be consumed by downstream analytic systems." Cloud IoT Core's other security features include end-to-end certificate-based authentication and TLS 1.2, and role-level access control, among others. In other news The Senate Sergeant at Arms officially sanctioned the use of the end-to-end encryption app Signal for use in the U.S. Senate. Signal encrypts messaging on Apple and Android phones, and has been used by aides to President Donald Trump, former President Barack Obama and New York Mayor Bill de Blasio following the revelations surrounding the involvement of Russian hackers with the 2016 presidential election. Signal, developed by the company Open Whisper Systems, has been the source of controversy, most recently because of a WikiLeaks release in March 2017. WikiLeaks claimed the CIA was able to bypass the encryption of secure messaging apps like WhatsApp, Wiebo and Signal. However, sources, including the Open Rights Group and ProtonMail, denied this claim and said that Signal and others are still secure means of messaging and that the CIA hadn't actually cracked the app's encryption scheme. WordPress has opened its bug bounty program to the public. The program had previously been running privately, but now white hat hackers can participate in the HackerOne program as well. "The security team has been working on this project for quite some time," said WordPress security team lead Aaron Campbell. "Nikolay Bachiyski started the team working on it just over a year ago. We ran it as a private program while we worked out our procedures and processes, and are excited to finally make it public." WordPress has already awarded $3,700 in bounties to seven different bug hunters. The program covers all WordPress projects, including BuddyPress, bbPress, GlotPress and WP-CLI. To submit a vulnerability to WordPress' bug bounty program, the researcher needs to include details of the vulnerability and a proof of concept. WordPress also asks that bug hunters avoid "privacy violations, destruction and modification of data on live sites." Electronic signature provider DocuSign suffered a data breach that lead to phishing attacks on its users. The data breach only resulted in the loss of customer and user email addresses, but the attackers then used the email addresses to send targeted phishing emails. The DocuSign users were already expecting an email from the company, so the phishing scheme is particularly dangerous. The phishing emails used DocuSign branding and contained a link to download a Microsoft Word document that contained malware. DocuSign reported that the phishing attacks started on May 16 and suggests users delete the email immediately.

Tech Apple Science Cars Samsung Nintendo Switch iPhone 7S & 8 Nintendo NES E3     Here Are Details For Google Android Go Posted: May 19 2017, 12:01pm CDT | by Ahmed Humayun, in News | Technology News     Google is going again at it, after a failed initial attempt of injecting Android to really the under-development countries of the world, using Android One as the operating system which would work on low-end phones. Android Go is what Google hopes to achieve the objective what Android One failed to do. Don't Miss: Find a Nintendo NES Classic in stock Android Go will be able to run on devices with even lesser than 1 gigs of RAM, according to its official specifications released by Google at the Google I/O event. Android Go is mainly developed to create a platform which could run smoothly in lower-end devices and keep the core values of Android untouched. Downgraded, probably, but not eliminated completely. Of course, such an operating system would be useless to bring out in a developed country where high-end smartphones loses their value once a successor arrives in a year. However, countries where smartphone usage is emerging, like Brazil, India, Argentina, and other such countries, they could very well benefit from Android Go, and benefit Google in return. Google will also pay extra attention on compatibility, applications with ridiculously high specifications requirements may not be able to run on Android Go, but there are thousands of other apps which can easily run in a system with 1GB RAM. Google will rebuild the Play Store from the ground up for Android Go. This Play Store will use visual cues and badges to indicate how smoothly can an app run on the particular device.

Nor has Apple allowed Google to remap the home button for Google Assistant.

Tech Apple Science Cars Samsung Nintendo Switch iPhone 7S & 8 Nintendo NES E3     Google Home Is Able To Make Phone Calls And Understand Commands Of Searching And Playing Videos Posted: May 19 2017, 12:13pm CDT | by Ahmed Humayun, in News | Technology News     Google Home is built as a constantly improving system that is able to learn new things and updates to perform more capabilities. Google has announced that Google Home will be introducing a lot of new features very soon. Download: The Tracker App Notifies You when a Hot Product is in Stock Google has also announced Google Home’s availability in more countries including Australia, Canada, Germany, Japan, and France, this is a great news for a lot of people as the device is only available to buy in US or UK currently. There is an amazing new feature which, according to our opinion, is a very practical one, known as proactive assistance. Once you tell Google Home to not disturb you a lot, it will actually not, but when it receives a notification that it must let you know of, the device will light up. The notification will only be put on speakers when you ask Google Home what is it. Google Home is also going to feature a free calling capability. You can call anyone, any number, may it be a landline or a mobile number, for free in US and Canada. The person who receives this call will not be able to see any identity except a “Private number” tag, which you can change to your personal number. Google Home is also interconnected to devices and even some applications. Searching for a place and saying “Let’s go” will open Google maps on your personal mobile device and set the directions for your destination. In-home tasks like watching videos or reviewing your calendar can be shown up by Google Home on your mobile device or Google’s Chromecast TV set. This story may contain affiliate links.

Zeman   @phonescooper Google I/O, the search company's annual developer conference, is wrapping up after a whirlwind few days in Mountain View, Calif. Google hit attendees with a blitz of announcements centered around artificial intelligence, machine learning, and mobility. While much of what Google showed off is meant for its developer partners, plenty will reach consumers in the days, weeks, and months ahead — not only on Android devices, but iOS, the web, your car, your wrist, your headset, and more. AD       article continues below... Here are the 5 most important things Google revealed this week. 1. Google Assistant One of the first things Google CEO Sundar Pichai said when he took the stage during Wednesday's keynote was to say Google is moving from a Mobile First company to an AI First company. Pichai made good on that promise. Google Assistant is soon going to be everywhere. Google expanded its voice-based helper to the iPhone, improved its feature set, and offered developers an SDK so they can add Assistant to their own apps, services, and hardware. Google Assistant Bringing Assistant to the iPhone is clutch. The U.S. market is somewhat unique in that about half of all smartphones are iPhones. That's dramatically different from the worldwide number for iPhone adoption, which sits at just 14%. Offering Google Assistant to iPhone owners effectively doubles the reach of Assistant in the U.S. Even if only a small percentage of iPhone owners adopt Assistant, it will let Google capture invaluable user data, and potentially pry iPhone owners away from Apple-based services (ahem, Siri) in favor of Google's. Google Home runs Google Assistant at its core and the in-home speaker is now more powerful. This week Google added what it calls Actions On Google to the Google Home product. In short, Home can now handle calendar and reminder requests; it now works with more audio and video streaming partners (Spotify, Soundcloud, HBO, CBS); and it can cast content directly to TV sets via voice command. Oh yeah, Google Home can now make voice calls. This is a big jump for Home owners. The new Google Assistant SDK provides developers with the tools they need to add hotword detection, voice recognition, and action-based responses to TVs, refrigerators, and other in-home gear. Companies such as LG have already committed to bringing Google Assistant to their products. I don't know about you, but I can't wait to talk to my fridge. Again, the basic goal here is to add points of contact between people and Assistant. Make no mistake, this week's expansion of Google Assistant clearly shows what's most important to Google and highlights its new vision. 2. Android Go Google is taking a new approach to put Android into the hands of everyone around the world, even those who can barely afford a phone. The Android Go initiative for entry-level devices would seem to replace the Android One project with the goal of "reaching the next billion users." Google already has 2 billion daily active users worldwide. That's about 24% of the world's population. Even so, only about half of everyone on the planet has a phone or smartphone, and Google knows that in order to reach more people it needs to offer a lower-cost solution. Android Go hopes to create a great smartphone experience for devices with 1 GB of memory or less. Google designed it around simple, relevant features that will truly help those with limited connectivity. The core system changes are part of Android O in order to optimize performance in entry-level hardware. Moreover, Google is targeting the Play Store in a big way to ensure there are Android Go capable apps. For example, it has reworked its own YouTube, Chrome, and GBoard apps to use less memory, take up less storage space on the phone, and use less mobile data via data compression and so on. Google expects developers to support Android Go by submitting full apps and Android Go apps to the Play Store. Google expects Android Go to fully launch on fresh hardware in early 2018. Google will share more details over the next few months. 3. Google Lens Google Lens may sound familiar. Google has offered an image search tool (Google Goggles) like this for some time. Even Nokia tried its hand at real-time, image-based search on its old Lumia smartphones. Google Lens takes the idea to through the logical next step. Google Lens Using Lens, people point their Android phone at something they see in the real world, such as a flower, and Google will perform an instant search based on the live image and provide a result. Like almost everything announced this week, machine learning plays a heavy role in the background. In the example provided on stage this week Google pointed a camera at several businesses, including a theater. Google Lens was able to read the billboard, determine the name of the venue and the band playing, and pull up search results complete with the option to purchase tickets and add the event to your calendar. That's powerful — all thanks to machine learning. Google Lens will make its debut in the coming months. 4. Google Photos Google Photos earned its own artificial intelligence and machine learning powers this week. Google says more than 500 million people use Photos every month, backing up an incredible 1.2 bllion photos and videos each day. This level of adoption led Google to find ways to improve the experience and is doing that through new AI (there's that word again) sharing tools. Google Photos First up, suggested sharing. Google Photos will automatically scan your pictures for things it recognizes and can categorize, like peoples' faces. Using machine learning, Google Photos will automatically select the best photos (in focus, good exposure) eliminate duplicates, and then remind you to share them with the people it thinks it sees in the photos. Users need only tap "send" once Google wraps up its magic. New shared libraries will help sharing in a different way. This lets people effortlessly send/receive photos with single users. Google says users can define how much of their library others will be able to see, including parameters such as time, date, location, and subject. With two people contributing to a shared library, Google Assistant will then do its job of creating stories, collages, movies, and so on. Last in this trio of sharing-themed tools is photo books. Google Photos will use all of the tools already mentioned to automatically create physical photo books that you can print and send to others ($10 for softcover, $20 for hardcover.) Google is rolling out all these tools to Android, iOS, and web users in the coming weeks. 5. Daydream 2.0 Euphrates If Cardboard was Google dipping its toe into the VR waters, Daydream 1.0 was Google wading in up to its knees, and Daydream 2.0 Euphrates represents Google diving all the way in. The next version of Daydream makes a huge leap forward in multiple directions at one. To start, more smartphones will soon be Daydream compatible. While only about eight handsets can use Daydream now (according to Google), it expects closer to 50 models will support it by the end of the year. Some of those devices will come from LG, Motorola, and Asus. (Verizon plans to sell the ZenFone AR later this summer.) Daydream More importantly, virtual reality is about to become more social. Right now, your vision of virtual reality is that of some nerd looking all around with a goody contraption on his head. This isn't going to change, but that nerd will no longer be exploring worlds by himself. Google wants people to share their VR experiences, and that's where Daydream 2.0 comes in. The new platform, which will reach all supported devices, will let people capture and share screenshots of what they're seeing, cast to TVs, and even join co-watching experiences via YouTube VR. The YouTube VR tool is neat, as it supports avatars, live comments, and more. VR is about to come to the web, too, thanks to full support for WebVR in Chrome for Android. Casting VR Google didn't forget about its Project Tango augmented reality platform. Moving forward, Daydream and Tango will be able to run on the same smartphones, allowing people to virtual and augmented worlds from a single device. Software tools will let people try on virtual clothes, measure the size of their living room for furniture purchases, and even explore shared spaces with its Expeditions AR app, intended to students. Daydream 1.0 got off to a slow start, but Google has a clearer purpose for its VR and AR spaces moving forward. Let's not forget developers, to whom Google gifted a wide range of new tools to create VR/AR apps and services. X Related Google Adjusts Google Now Cards and Search Google has updated the appearance of its Google Now and Google Search tools on Android devices to match the company's new design motif. First and foremost, the apps adopt the new logo and font changes Google made earlier this week. Google Music Gains Machine Learning for Improved Recommendations Google today updated its Google Music service for Android, iOS, and the web with the hope that it will provide better, more personalized music recommendations. Moving forward, Google Music will match users' existing libraries and playlists with outside cues, such as location, weather, and activity, to make smarter suggestions. Google Improves Link Sharing from AMP Articles Google this week made it simpler for mobile device users to share AMP articles. AMP articles are specially formatted for viewing on mobile devices and load faster than standard web sites. Google Pushes Second Beta of Android 7.1.2 Google has released a second beta update for Android 7.1.2. Build NPG47I is rolling out to the Google Pixel, Pixel XL, Pixel C, Nexus 5X, Nexus 6P, and Nexus Player devices, as long as those devices are enrolled in the public beta program. Google Brings Android Auto to Every Car via New Android App Google today announced a new app for smartphones that gives everyone the opportunity to use Android Auto in their car. Android Auto has been available to select cars with in-dash screens for about two years. more news about:   Comments Start a new discussion You must log in to post.

Android O Developer Preview 2 gets a small bump to OPP2.170420.019, partially fixes Android Pay but isn't installing on many Nexus devices Richard Gao Follow View All Posts 2017/05/18 6:32pm PDTMay 18, 2017 39 Plus 1 on G+ 98 Share on Facebook 47 Share on Twitter Total Shares184 Android O Android OS Google News Nexus 5X Nexus 6P Nexus Player Pixel Pixel XL Android O's second developer preview was only released yesterday, but Google has already released an update for it. We're getting bombarded with tips from readers with Nexus and Pixel devices alike. This update reportedly somewhat fixes Android Pay, which did not open at all on yesterday's version. However, it appears that Nexus devices are having trouble updating. This OTA bumps the version number to OPP2.170420.019 and is weighing in at anywhere between 38.8 and 55.9MB, depending on which Google device you have. One tipster informed us that Pay is no longer throwing him an 'unsupported in this build' message and shows him a normal screen with his cards, but hasn't tested whether they're working or not.   A rare, successful install on a Nexus 6P. While the update seems to be installing just fine on Pixel and Pixel XL devices, a majority of owners with Nexus devices appear to be having some trouble. From what we can tell, units of Nexus 5X and 6P smartphones, as well as the Nexus Player, are throwing errors and showing the dead Android logo in recovery. After a hard reboot, the devices are booting up fine, but they remain on yesterday's OPP2.170420.017 build. One user is claiming that Android Pay has begun working for his 6P, despite the install appearing to fail. However, there are users successfully updating their 6Ps to the 0.019 build. (update: It looks like those who flashed the O factory image are updating without issue, while those who took the OTA from Nougat are struggling. This is due to devices that updated from Nougat via OTA retaining the 7.1.2 build fingerprint. Flashing the factory image and then taking the OTA should get the update to work.) Factory image and OTA downloads are not yet available. An official post in the Android Beta Program Google+ page states that the update will hit all devices currently enrolled in the preview within the next few hours, but given the installation failures that Nexus devices are seeing, it's likely to be halted. We'll update this post with more information when we get it.

Dirge Not the ugly, ugly dots! No! Trooper311 Have not noticed that myself. Tiuri Elvander They never appeared for me in the first place. Do you know which apps support them?? Leroy You have to enable the special permissions, under apps& notifications Maxime Labrecque-Raymond Where exactly? do you have a screenshot ? Tiuri Elvander If I go to Settings > Apps & Notifications > App Info, and select Gmail (because it's often shown to support dots in screenshots), Then I go to App notifications and Badge app icon is switched on, yet none appear. Is there a different setting somewhere that I've missed??? Ah, just saw another reply. It's pixel launcher only :( Laraib Zafar Khan Is the notification dot only for pixel launcher? Tr3ple Yes Daniel Grobe I have pixel launcher on my nexus 5x, the dots dont work for me.. nor does the picture in picture. Dirge Installed fine on my Pixel; Won't install on my Nexus Player. vwnut13 Does Hulu open on your Nexus Player? Dirge I don't use Hulu so I don't know. Kyle Anyone having scrambled audio when playing videos? Usually within Facebook or streamable videos. Julian Berger Yes I have it when playing Youtube videos in chrome maestro PL Installed fine on my 6P. Android Pay enabled OkieDokie This small OTA failed to install for me twice (Nexus 6P) 2 Men-E Thanks for the update on the update... My Nexus 6P and I await good news... vwnut13 Had to revert on my Nexus player, as the update broke Hulu. On second thought, wonder if it has anything to do with my unlocked bootloader... Nexus✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Remember folks this software isn't ready for a daily driver yet. They say so themselves. Consider yourself lucky if your using it and they fix stuff like android pay. Also do not forget to unlock your bootloader if you are using the beta. If you do not unlock the bootloader and the beta on your phone goes south you can not use your computer to fix your phone and restore it. Period. The only fix is to send it in. You can re lock the bootloader after the final stable builds are released. Carson Saldanha Wow, thanks for that second part. Didn't think about that. 👍 Dn Bro I disagree with the bootloader thing. I think if they are sending out fixes to Android Pay, they actually want the bootloaders locked. Also, I would say that at the very least, make sure you go into deveopler settings and allow unlocking. That way, you can at least still unlock your phone if it won't boot. Matty032 Is that the USB Debugging option? ZettabyteGamer I'm using it as my daily and while it has only been one day it has been pretty solid for me. It's in beta, I think it is ready for daily driver use for people who are okay with minor hiccups here and there. Martial Clausse I don't think it's ready yet. Lots of apps are crashing, including inbox and Google search... Joshua Lillis The only app that FC on me is Samsung pay, smooth sailing for me. Martial Clausse Out of curiosity, which device are you using ? And did you update through the OTA or flashed the factory image ? Joshua Lillis I have the pixel XL, I enrolled in the beta program and took two ota, one from nougat to o and then the .019 OTA. SomeGuy112 Seems pretty stable on my Pixel XL. The Pixel performance lead at Google said the Beta is pretty stable on Twitter recently but maybe that's only for the Pixel version. https://mobile.twitter.com/t_murray/status/864927591274127360 Laraib Zafar Khan Apple music is FC too BrandoHD This information isn't correct, you can flash official factory images with a locked bootloader ZettabyteGamer I hope you didn't mean to reply to me, because I never said anything about a bootloader. Joshua Lillis I think he meant to reply to Nexus 2 Men-E I don't use Android Pay, but I do notice the signal will drop for extensive periods of time on my Nexus 6P... Most stuff is running "okay", though... LALO Everything works fine on my Google Pixel. Surprisingly no apps have crashed since I updated. blackeyeX2 On my 6P, I have had more FC's and freezing than I did on the Alpha preview. boop Looks like it comes with the new Assistant features (or maybe I just got them at the same time). Dirge You got them the same time. It is a server side switch. . Carlos Rodríguez The OTA fails because the recovery has an old build fingerprint from 7.1.2, so the installer fails. You can try to install the OTA many times and it will fail. When you get the error, press Power + Volume Up to see the actual error, then you can safely reboot from there. The solution is to sideload the full DP2 OTA from here (https://developer.android.com/preview/download-ota.html ) or the factory image from here (https://developer.android.com/preview/download.html ) and then you can install the small OTA. Cheers! Peter Good work sir. Thanks for the info. Richard Gao Thanks for letting us know. I've added this to the post. Mike Arnett Stupid question: the OTA on my phone to this was 55mb, but the OTA package is 1GB. Is this the full image, and will it wipe all my data? Carlos Rodríguez The full OTA shouldn't wipe the device, make a backup just in case. blackeyeX2 The 55mb one was an update to the full (1GB) released yesterday. bobfrealy Per Carlos R.'s suggestion, after having registered for beta, taking 017 ota, failing with E3001 error on 019 ota, I downloaded and sideloaded the 017 ota. now the 019 system update notification is nowhere to be found. any idea on how to get that back? just wait? meanwhile recover still shows 7.1.2, and Android Pay seems to be running fine. Carlos Rodríguez After some minutes the update should show up. Check for updates. It eventually appeared for me the 3 times it failed to install. bobfrealy yep, it showed back up. and still failed (that's why i mentioned my recovery version, most likely the issue). will likely have to do full image. better to have a full clean install, just a pain with much setup to do afterward. blackeyeX2 Google Pay. My update failed, but Android Pay is now working anyways. Zikaeroh This didn't work for me. After sideloading the update and trying to install the OTA, I get the same error. I'd simply flash just the recovery image from the factory image, but I'm not OEM unlocked. :( Carlos Rodríguez Indeed. The only solution is to unlock the bootloader and flash the DP2 recovery. I guess we're screwed until google does something. Paige Turner I'am freelancing using the web, performing basic jobs that requires from you personal pc or alternatively laptop and additionally internet service access and so I couldn't be more satisfied... 6 months have passed by when i started off this and also i profited up to now overall 36,000 dollars... Basically i profit almost $80/hourly and work for 3 to 4 h everyday.And superb point regarding this work is that you can actually decide when to work yourself as well as for how long and you are compensated at the end of each week.>>>> learn by clicking here how to do it right now Flint_PS 017 OTA sideload doesn't work, I got the error again Fernando Pena So, I decided to start from scratch and flashed the factory image, following updating the .19 OTA. Everything went just fine and I was able to boot the device and restore my backup. Then I started to install/update my apps and noticed that Google App isn't updating, the app keeps refusing to update even downloading the latest APK from apkmirror. It's currently stuck at version 6.16 and this sucks because assistant is not working. Play store doesn't show any updates even if I apply for Google app beta. I don't know what to do, I would appreciate some help... blackeyeX2 The updated images ending 19 are not available yet, the ones posted are still 17. So OTA is only option for now. JC I was getting the same error. It never successfully installed on my nexus 5x. Dn Bro So I did the OTA yesterday on my Nexus 6P, got the Android Pay is unsupported, as was the case. Today, tried this update, it failed, but now when I open the android pay it shows my cards like normal. Not sure if they work, but there you go. Nate Hallett I'm still on the .017 build from yesterday on my Pixel XL, I took the beta OTA and have opened & used Android Pay without a problem. I don't understand why so many people don't have Android Pay enabled on yesterday's build, even with the N Preview they enabled Android Pay so why would it be different this time around? I'm currently waiting for the .019 OTA to finish installing, I'll update my comment with the results. nxtiak I'm on 017 on my XL and I just opened Android Pay and it said it's not enabled in this preview. Installing 019 now. lomsha It's only toward the end that pay was enabled on n previews, not from the start. Frisi Started installing on my Pixel XL. After step 1 was done, it restarted. Still on .017. Thing is, it started step 2 but it hangs here. Andeoid Pay now works, though. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/721d0f338ee7cfe4ff4a19f06d55c9318dd4fa5e7be02f24d9f4befb5eff7b14.png Frisi Well, it started moving after I posted this. I don't know what's causing it to take that long. daburghit It failed for me on a Nexus 5X but I can secondarily confirm that Android Pay works post-failure on the 17 build. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/7c5c1a621e6af03a2092437d0a84552a7cb821509966e5f48c9bdb8ce2a19af5.png Anthony Castanza Android Pay started loading again for me *without* installing this update. It appears to be a server side fix and not directly related to this build. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/bca05de36f641e9afb90773dd4129e37cd5eee46791485bab34ec82e2c423f39.png Chris Thurber Same for me as well except on a 6P! JeffCO Just updated on the XL and Android Pay which was not working earlier now comes up. Haven't tried to use it. Bizziet I was hoping it fixed the now broken MMS issue in messages! Try to add a picture and the whole messages app freezes. Pixel XL on T-mobile. ZettabyteGamer Just updated my XL and when I go to add a new card to Android Pay I get "Android Pay can't be used on this device" So it isnt fixed for me atleast. Lucas Araujo It seems that the update has been pulled. My N5X had the same problem while applying the update and it is not showing in the updates anymore. My Android version still at *.017. Also, after update failure, my google photos app lost its icon and ir showing a generic Android Robot icon. bobfrealy My Photos app icon had this problem immediately after taking 017 ota. reboot; clear cache; etc, re-install app, nothing restored icon. :( doesn't matter now as i'm likely full 017 flashing. blackeyeX2 I disabled the app (which then uninstalled app to original version), then it updated and Icon is back to normal!! Just wiping the cache will not work. blackeyeX2 It's not pulled. It will show up again in your notifications in 30 min, or so. I've tried it a couple of times and each time it reappears after some time. JohnyNoLegs Quality google. Brian Sandoval Not sure if anyone had this issue after update on 6P? I have a hidden network for my wifi and device once updated will no longer connect to it. Ján “Johnny” Valentík This new build fixed for me Google Play Music inside Android Auto on my Pixel XL. In 0.17 I couldn't play any music nor the widget with controls would show... Mattsus The OTA update worked for me this morning(UK time), this is coming directly from an OTA update from Nougat to O Dev Preview 2, can confirm Android Pay now works. neon tiger Have you tried actually using it or just opening the app ? Mattsus I've tried both opening the app, adding new card details as old one expired yesterday, and using it against several terminals. Can confirm no issues thus far. Before update, opening the app wouldn't work but was able to pay using it no problem at all. Joshua Lillis I guess I'm lucky, took the beta OTA from 7.1.2, and now took the .019 OTA just fine. Couldn't flash a factory image if I wanted to, damn Verizon. mieszk3 Nexus 5X 019 OTA: https://android.googleapis.com/packages/ota-api/google_bullhead_bullhead/44bdd4f9967717bad5ef82a54c1dbf2c1ba92fa1.zip Rowan I tried to install it today on my Nexus 6p and a error message came up. I thought it was about to start boot looping but it turned on minutes later to my releif Besnik Rrustemi It worked for me on my Nexus 6P. But maybe it is because i was on 7.1.2 and updated to DP2 the moment they announced it on live Google I/O (0.17 build) and after the first update the 0.19 installed without problem, So maybe the issue is updating directly from 7.1.2 to DP2 0.19 ? jon Hutchinson The update failed on my Nexus 6p. Though android pay began to work. Double edge sword though I'm glad my android pay is restored. I'm still on 0.17. Updated over OTA and even for a factory reset while on Android o. iftekhar bongo my nexus 5x showing error while installing upate... any solution? Leroy This latest build seems to cause problems with safetynet. Stock phones are registered as 'uncertified' in the play store and Android pay doesn't work because the devices are rooted, only they're not.. Small OTA received over the beta factory images on 5X.. Device is marked as uncertified now lol https://www.reddit.com/r/AndroidPreviews/comments/6c0bsg/small_ota_received_over_the_beta_factory_images/ neon tiger Yeah my banking app won't let me use fingerprint login because of this. Leroy Yeah it's really annoying. Hopefully they can fix it on their end without. Would be a shame is we have to reflash 017 build or wait for next OTA to fix it. compuguy1088 Same here on the PixelXL. I'm sure they will update SafetyNet soon enough to fix this. wickets So, next question....when are they fixing PIP?? :) Ernie My Nexus 6p also got an error trying to update from . 17 to. 19 as well. Cache wipe didn't solve the problem either. Any other tricks? Alex Kruger I installed the update via OTA on my Pixel XL, now I can open Android Pay, but I can't add any cards because it thinks my bootloader is unlocked. It's not, I've done everything through the official OTA channel. nextelnutt I received the update and got the dead Android error. However, my build number did indicate .019, then 25 minutes ago, I noticed the update was available again for my 6P. So I downloaded and installed again and device restarted fine. As for Android Pay, I will try it when I am out shopping today. Robert Macdonald Play store now showing as uncertified, Android pay loads but says cannot be used. Otherwise it installed just fine on my pixel. Andreas Constantinides 6p here, got the issue. JoeInMO On my Pixel XL I get "Android Pay can't be used on this device." I'm not rooted or bootloader unlocked. I never had Pay set up before. Matty032 I have the same error. Maxime Labrecque-Raymond Got the issue and my DOTs dosen't work Nexus 6P blacleyeX2 The OTA Nexus 6P failed, but I can confirm that Android Pay is now working and I have used it for a transaction. Not sure how that worked, any ideas? Marty Got the error. 6P. blacleyeX2 The available images are only for the images ending 17 and not the new 19, so we can't side load yet. mieszk3 All of you with unlocked bootloader -> manually flash via fastboot: bootloader, boot, radio and recovery and then 019 OTA will work. (Probably only bootloader is necessary). Marty Firmware not available yet. mieszk3 Use 017 version, then sideload 019 OTA Marty "Factory image and OTA downloads are not yet available." mieszk3 Nexus 5X 017->019 OTA: https://disq.us/url?url=https%3A%2F%2Fandroid.googleapis.com%2Fpackages%2Fota-api%2Fgoogle_bullhead_bullhead%2F44bdd4f9967717bad5ef82a54c1dbf2c1ba92fa1.zip%3AgIXISwZNuhjf2FlMgjO4Va15Lr0&cuid=1370072 Firmwares: https://developer.android.com/preview/download.html Marty I was just contrasting what you said with what the article said. I'm not desperate to update my 6P. I don't use it anymore. Ultra Sage My nexus 5x worked fine for the first few hours. Then when this update came out, I tried installing it but my phone kept on crashing and restarting after every few minutes. It was not bootloop since I could receive calls, but if I opened anything else, then it would crash and restart. I finally managed to use terminal to unlock the boot loader and restore nougat factory image, since the OTA download would stall the screen, and it would restart. I was a beta tester for Nougat, but this was a bad experience. Kris Fannin Same issue with my Nexus 6P. Update fails. Just another data point for you and thanks for the information. ctk4949 I was about to switch back to my Pixel XL from my S8+. But when I tried connecting my Gear S3 watch, it wouldn't open the app. It force closes each time. :( Matt McNair After the update Android Pay will launch but I just tried to pay with it and I get a message stating that my Pixel XL isn't eligible. Had to pull out the ole wallet. StW I tried to apply this update twice on my Nexus 6P but each time the updated failed near the beginning of the install. However, yesterday Android Pay was not working (unsupported developer version message) but today, even though the install failed, Android Pay works. Cael Android Pay works on my Pixel XL after receiving this update. Ernie I think Google might have pulled the . 19 update for the Nexus 6p. I haven't gotten a notification for the update for almost 2 hours now. EnerJi I still have a notification pending on my Nexus 5X. I wonder if that means it's been fixed on the 5X? I've been holding off on trying it until I see some folks confirm that it works for people who OTAd from 7.1.2. Matty032 At first I got the root error with Android pay. But, I cleared cache and then restarted the phone. I was then able to complete the transaction. Works now. That's after Google Chat Support told me it wouldn't work with O. LOL Ian Kumlien 019 ota is up and will apply on a 017 Android O OTA (as in N -> O) phone via ADB sideload Guilherme Noronha Just got the update notification again after failing​ to install this morning. The version is the same, but now it's a 1047MB download. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/9000c49c9403d0d934b43f20e78a43675548972a522f62b370ca9822f5b69643.png Guilherme Noronha Just installed the 1047MB OTA. It installed successfully and build number went up to .019 OkieDokie Awesome news. My 6P is downloading a much bigger .019 OTA as well, this time it is 1053.3 MB so hopefully this one works like it did for your 5X. satyendra karn It is working now. For my Nexus 6P, Installation​ size got changed from 55 mb to 1053.3 mb for build no .019.

Netflix was just the start: Google Play Console lets developers exclude app availability for devices that don't pass SafetyNet Rita El Khoury Follow View All Posts 2017/05/18 3:57am PDTMay 18, 2017 93 Plus 1 on G+ 108 Share on Facebook 82 Share on Twitter Total Shares283 Google News Last weekend, a huge turmoil swept the root-enthusiast Android community as it was discovered then confirmed that the Netflix app was being blocked from showing up in search results on the Play Store for rooted devices. At the time, Netflix said it was using Widevine to block unsupported devices, but that made no sense to us: the app was still functional if it was sideloaded, it was only not showing up as compatible in the Play Store. So what sorcery was Netflix really using?! Turns out it's a new function of the Google Play Console. As part of the updates announced for the Play Console at I/O 2017, Google mentions a new Device Catalog section under Release management that lets developers choose with intricate granularity which devices their app supports on the Play Store. Devices can be viewed and excluded by many attributes including RAM and SoC, but the important factor we're interested in is SafetyNet Attestation. New "Device catalog" lets devs manage the exclusions. Developers will be able to choose from 3 states shown in the top image: not excluding devices based on SafetyNet, excluding those that don't pass integrity, or excluding the latter plus those that aren't certified by Google. That means any dev could potentially block their apps from showing and being directly installable in the Play Store on devices that are rooted and/or running a custom ROM, as well as on emulators and uncertified devices (think Meizu and its not-so-legal way of getting Play Services and the Play Store on its phones). This is exactly what many of you were afraid would happen after the Play Store app started surfacing a Device certification status. This is different from the full SafetyNet API implementation that apps like Android Pay and Pokémon Go use. In the case of Pay/Go, the attestation check happens when the app is installed on your phone and doesn't allow it to run unless it passes the integrity test. But in the case of the Play Console, the attestation check happens when you're browsing the Play Store and only affects the availability of the app for your device. If the full SafetyNet API isn't included in the app itself, you will still be able to grab the APK from other sources, install it, and the app will work just fine. Still, this spells trouble for rooted users and the Android enthusiast community as a whole. Google keeps erecting more and more obstacles each day in the face of root and custom ROMs and even if this won't stop root users who should be knowledgable enough to know how/where to grab an APK and install it, it will make things more and more difficult and maybe less and less worth the trouble. But y'all are rebels and you'll keep on finding a way around it, won't you?

Nice move Google. Suicide_Note Not sure if serious, but either way, this was just a matter of time. YouNex Obviously not serious EowynCarter So, question : Is there anyway to get android O in the future on my nexus 6 and not having problems with this ? IF manufacturer where taking care of updating their devices, wouldn't be an issue... saf1927 If Magisk keeps working, yep. You can. Even my old Nexus 5 is on 7.1.2 and it passes SafetyNet. EowynCarter I want "just work" stuff. Not workaround. Maybe Magisk does the job for some, but not an acceptable solution from my point of view. Mainly the "we don't know if it will keep on working" part. saf1927 Well, it's the best solution so far and it has improved a lot since its inception. I never bothered since the Nexus 5 was a secondary device for me, but now that some apps won't show up anymore on the Play Store, I simply flashed Magisk and that's about it. I haven't tweaked anything. Plus, if you are already flashing a custom ROM, flashing an extra zip file isn't that much work anyway. EowynCarter True, but it's the phone I use dailly. I don't want apps sudendly not working, becasue google decided to push an update that broke magisk. mxwp well if you want things to "just work" then i guess get an iPhone EowynCarter Sadly, I'm beginning to think about that. But that would cause others frustrations. ED-Zが現れた! Well, people will just flock to root-supported apps... Milton P. I actually forgot when was the last time I Rooted a device. No biggie. Suicide_Note The bad thing is it isn't just root that causes problems. Simply unlocking the bootloader will produce the same result. Maxr1998 Just because it's no biggie for you, it doesn't mean everyone approves this. I am actually pretty concerned, because this limits the freedom over our devices even more.. Milton P. Define freedom, please. Maxr1998 Software freedom, to be more specific. You should have the freedom to use and modify your device and it's software however you'd like, and have fill control over it. That means, root access. And since the AOSP core IS free software, the 4 freedoms defined by Richard Stallman apply to it. What this change now introduces is that you're forced to decide between either giving up the freedom over your device or not using the app you wanted to download (which will probably have to be my choice, and that sucks). Milton P. But you're not giving up anything, you just have to make a choice. If you put that way, Google has the freedom of doing with the AOSP core whatever they want, the same way you can modify said core and do as you please, the difference is Google has more money and more responsibilities when it comes to their user base. XDA and other sites will still have a bunch of developers making whatever they please (within the AOSP terms) with the AOSP core. This will just change thinks for the people that use those ROMs bit realistically the vast majority of users won't feel the changes. Sad but true. h4rr4r That choice is giving up freedom you had before. The vast majority will see the rate of Android improvements slow as the Devs on XDA and the like lose interest. Android only exists because of Linux, now it is turning its back on that whole culture. Milton P. Well, I don't see your freedom compromised to be honest with you, but we're seeing things from different angles so that's that. Sorry for your loss in that case. h4rr4r You do not think losing control of your device is a loss of freedom? Milton P. Nope, is just a device, I have more important stuff going on, m device is a tool the same way a hammer is a tool, you can buy a hammer and use it as it is. Sometimes my device is a toy, if I buy a remote control car I'll modify it as long as it is possible, the same way I modify my phone. I have control over my phone. I can install whatever I want at my own risk. If I decide to root my phone I expect things to be broken. I remember when I had an HTC and I hated sense so I decided to install a custom ROM, I gave up the camera and I was aware of it. There was always some compromises with custom ROMs, nothing is changing. I rather have a safe device then a compromised one today, still my choice thou. h4rr4r So you want IOS. Got it. Over here I want freedom. I don't think homedepot should be allowed to tell me what I can hit with the hammer I bought. trparky Open platforms rarely stay open once they become popular. Once the Benjamins come rolling in it tends to override open. h4rr4r Tell that to Linus Torvalds. I am sure he will have many many fuck yous for you. trparky Linux is the rare situation. h4rr4r The rare situation like many others that created android and even google. trparky Yeah but look at Android, the walls are closing around it and there's nothing you can do about it. Face it man, the geeks may have built the system but the common man now rules it. Geeks love choice, yes, they do love their choice but your average person doesn't give a rat's ass about choice. All they want is a device that does what they need it to do when they want to do it. They have no inclination to learn how it works or why it works just as long as it does. This is what geeks do not and refuse to understand. h4rr4r Sure there is, stop using it. Then the common folks will have to follow us to the next platform. trparky As long as their is money involved in maintaining Android it doesn't matter if something better comes along, people will continue supporting Android because it makes them money. Money makes the world go round, get used to it. Maxr1998 ^ What @h4rr4r:disqus says. trparky Yep. The root and ROM community is such a small portion of the Android ecosystem that they really don't matter to them. People have been screaming at Google for years to get the Android house fixed up, this is them doing just that. You can't blame them for doing what the people have asked for. mxwp I agree with you, but sadly you only have freedom over hardware. You can do what you want with the device you buy. But with software you never actually buy it... you only buy a license to use it. Thus you have no real freedom with software. Maxr1998 Android is free software, Apache 2.0 license. At least the AOSP part of it. trparky But the Google parts of it are not covered under the Apache 2.0 license. That's essentially why ROM developers can't package the Google Play Services pack with the ROM itself and instead requires you to download a separate ZIP package from Google to install it separate from the ROM package. Android itself may be free and open but the Google Play Services part is not. Sudev There are far more than few arguments against root access but here are some: Root access is meant for experimental & development purpose and not for Daily Driver for any average user of the platform. Google Play Services & Apps available on Play Store are not "Free Software". Google as provider of Play Services infrastructure has much more liabilities then one can simply assume. And also the app developers have responsibility to protect end users' data. If device has root access available and any rouge app / maleware steals other apps data which is possible, who will be at stack? h4rr4r The ability to do anything I want with my things that I own. Milton P. You​ can do whatever you want with your device, nobody is stopping you. You might see that some apps are not showing up in the play store but you can still side load them, I still see freedom in your future. h4rr4r For how much longer? Soon these apps will ask play services if they are supposed to be installed on that device, at that point you can say goodbye to sideloading. If this is what people want then IOS was the platform for them. thecoolkid Ok Google, define freedom... 😁 Nick I would imagine a great deal of people on this site will be upset, but in actuality I don't think this will affect the user base of many apps that badly h4rr4r Not in the short term. However in the long term it will. Android only exists because of the FREE software movement. Nick Yes, but that doesn't apply to applications, which this is about. h4rr4r Think long term. Same thing applies. trparky No it won't because the root and ROM community is so small it doesn't matter to Google anymore. The 95% of people who simply want a device that works don't care and likely won't ever care. As long as they can play NetFlix, Pokemon Go, or whatever is the next craze they don't care. h4rr4r Again, that is short term thinking. Think past the end of your nose. Android exists because of linux. Google needs this small group to create the very stuff they rely on. trparky You overestimate the value that the community has now. Android may have needed the community back in the beginning to gain the foothold that it has in the market but not so anymore. Android has near 100% market penetration, they have achieved world domination. They don't need the community anymore, they have achieved their goals. h4rr4r Until they are unseated. IBM once had a monopoly on computing devices. They did not need the community to gain a foothold, they would not have a product to gain a foothold without the community. Android only exists because of a collection of those projects. trparky No, Android exists because Samsung, HTC, and LG make devices people want and it makes them money by the semi-truck full. The community doesn't mean shit now, all that matters to these companies is one thing... money, money, and more money. Oh, and did I mention money? This is capitalism man, money rules the world. If you don't make money you are dead. h4rr4r Please tell me how that would have happened without linux. Money loses to good engineering every day. Look at how linux killed solaris. trparky Tell me why Windows is the defacto monopoly on the desktop despite the fact that Linux is better in every damn way possible under the hood? That's right... money. h4rr4r Because the desktop is dead. The fight is over. They lost. Even money can't keep them relevant. trparky Oh, you're funny. The desktop is not dead, it will never be dead. When people need to do real work, they sit down at a desktop. When people want to play real games, they sit down at a desktop. When people need to type out anything longer than a page like a college term paper, they sit down at a desktop. The desktop is king and will always be king. Long live the desktop! h4rr4r The Desktop is a dead man walking. When they do real work, they use a Citrix session. When they game they use a console, or they are already nerds. When people type they can use a fucking chromebook. The desktop as you think of it died already. trparky Try and say that shit over at TechPowerUp, HardOCP, Overclock.net, TomsHardware, etc. and trust me when I say this... you'll be run out of town by people with pitchforks and torches. h4rr4r Those are all nerds. Those are the folks who have desktops running 3 different OSes. They are the folks who are pissed about android being locked down. trparky And your point being? You just admitted that only the "nerds" care about Android being open. Sure, those same "nerds" will go off and create a new platform but the rest of the people who are living in the real world and who don't care one damn bit about how it works will continue to use Android. h4rr4r Those people will eventually move to the new platform. Just like they did with Android. trparky And the same thing will happen to that platform in the future that's happening to Android now. Open platforms are nice and all, I'll admit that, but your average person doesn't care one bit. I dare you to go up to any person on the street and ask them anything about Android. What phone do they have? What model? Most will say "I don't know, something that my carrier gave me for cheap." h4rr4r The wheel of computing we call it. It has happened and will happen again. So what? trparky Which reinforces the idea that I said before, eventually all open systems will become closed (or less open) at some point in their life cycle. It usually happens when it becomes popular with the common man. Why? Because like I've been trying to get through your thick skull, the average person doesn't care how any of this stuff works so long as it works. h4rr4r The average person does not matter. Few open systems become closed. AOSP is still fine. trparky What the hell do you mean by "they don't matter"? They're the ones buying the devices, buying the apps, looking at the ads, etc. Just how the fuck does that translate to "they don't matter"? h4rr4r Because they don't. They don't create, they don't cause new things to be created. They are just users, just like I don't matter to how movies are created. trparky But without money from the people who are consuming said things developers won't make new stuff. Developers do have to eat you know and put a roof over their heads. h4rr4r The giant world of FOSS pretty much proves you wrong. Demand cannot create supply. I don't pirate anything kiddo. I have way too much to lose for that. One of those lawsuits I would actually have to pay, since I could. trparky I'll give a hint on how FOSS works a lot of the time. Some of the top tier Linux kernel developers actually work for companies and they just contribute code in their free time. They may work for Intel, AMD, nVidia, or God knows what but only after their day job is done. Why? Because they need money and they need to eat. This is a basic requirement for people in this world. They need money!!! People don't just write code for the love of it, even Linus Torvalds who's in charge of the Linux kernel itself works for the Linux Foundation and yes, he gets paid for his work to the tune of $10 Million a year. Sorry to burst your bubble man but FOSS projects aren't all happy, happy, joy, joy here... people need to be paid real money to be able to eat, drive a car, put a roof over their heads, etc. On second thought, I'm not sorry I burst your bubble! You need it burst! PEOPLE NEED TO BE PAID REAL FUCKING MONEY!!!! h4rr4r No, they get paid to contribute. During the work day. Not as a hobby. Lots of projects are like that. I won't say exactly how I know about that ;) Their employers just aren't as short sighted as you. Linus did not however create linux to get rich. Great code like great art gets created because it must be. People do what they love. Kid, you will get it one day. When you have enough that you aren't worried about it each day, money stops being that big of a deal. Don't worry everybody goes through a phase like you are now. trparky Dude, we are not the Federation of Planets here living in a happy, happy, joy, joy world in which people can just do whatever they want to do without a care in the world. As long as human greed exists there will always be a need for money. And believe you me, greed will never go away unless we breed a new kind of human and I don't see that happening any time soon. Gene Roddenberry's future will never happen, it just won't. Contrary to a lot of geek dreams it just won't. h4rr4r No idea where you got that idea. Never suggested it. My point was the personal relative value of increasing income drops as income goes up. If you make minimum wage doubling your income is a huge deal. Adding the same amount to my income would not get me to take a job I like less. Offering it to Linus would be a waste of time. Yes, some people will keep chasing dollars, they are the exception not the rule. The employers are working on enlightened self interest. Either they use the FOSS product, gain market advantage with direct knowledge, use it for marketing or believe they are getting something else. PostgreSQL for example has a lot of paid contributors who work for companies that either provide customization, consulting or depend on the project. Others just because it increases quality. Commercial software by and large is not high quality. I have seen a lot of it and 90% if you tried to submit it to a FOSS project of any size would get you denied and possibly mocked. This system continues to be more innovative because it is easy to continue to expand. Anyone with a good idea can fork if their idea is not accepted. trparky > My point was the personal relative value of increasing income drops as income goes up. Tell that to the people in Washington or any CEO that demands ever increasing yearly salaries and end of year bonuses all while raping the companies that they work for. Tell that to the psychopaths on Wall Street. For as long as their is money, people will want more of it. Anyone who says that they don't is flat out lying. h4rr4r Those are the exception not the rule. That is why you call them psychopaths. Honestly, correcting for inflation I really don't care that much if I ever make more. Would it be nice sure, would I give up anything I like about my job? No. If you could double my income but it prevented me from contributing to FOSS projects or owning code I generate off the clock, I would not take that deal. If money was enough to make people do anything MS would have offered Linus $11 million a year to not write it. Heck, Sun would have done it while they were still around. trparky Either you're a child that doesn't know how the adult world works or you're a fucking troll. h4rr4r So you have no idea who makes stuff, neat. I guess you think Henry Ford should have made a faster horse. trparky Oh, I know who makes the stuff I use but I also make sure that they are paid! I give money to those developers who write the programs that I enjoy and if I can't pay them I won't use their programs. I only use a program if I can pay for it. I have put money into their tip jars on their web site, I look for PayPal links and I donate even if it's something small like $5. They deserve it! h4rr4r Good for you! There is a lot of great software that does not make money that way. Some even just ask is that you follow the license, like linux which mediatek steals by not releasing kernel source. So I hope you avoid buying that kind of thing. trparky MediaTek controller chips are known to suck so I don't buy them out of that reason alone. h4rr4r Now I have given you another good reason to avoid them. Bunch of thieves. Rita El Khoury I don't even remember when I last bootloader unlocked. But I know this move toward closing the ecosystem further and further will have ripples in the future. The enthusiast community flocked toward Android for its openness and we have custom ROMs and their enterprising devs to thank for HUNDREDS of new features that they implemented first and everyone clamored for and applauded until they became features in AOSP. If Google thinks it can steer this ship alone and it knows best what to do next, we may have less and less interesting features in the future and more and more of what only one entity thinks is best, not a diverse set of opinions. Nick Given that this only gives the developer the option of requiring these checks, it makes me believe that Google had to do this for some companies that have regulatory or other kinds of requirements. Which is a shame for the rooted (and unlocked?) community, but understandable. Shame Google is most likely going to take the blame here in this comment section though. Rita El Khoury Well, maybe they had to, but that won't stop any developer from implementing it without any regulatory or legal requirement pushing them to do so. Nick Right, which puts this choice on the developer, not Google. Google was stuck behind a rock and hard place, perhaps. EowynCarter Well, google is certainly to blame for not planing to update my nexus 6 to android O. And now I can't even use custom rom as plan B without losing some apps :( Suicide_Note Boo hoo. Buy a new phone and quit crying that Google doesn't support phones forever. EowynCarter Fine can you order a pixel XL and ship it to me in France ? Plus, my nexus 6 still works, I hate having to replace working stuff. Makes no sense, economically and ecologically speaking. Suicide_Note I'll sell you my XL when I'm done with it, but only after i get the Pixel XL 2. :) EowynCarter Well, I do hope Google sells the "pixel 2 "( or whatever its name) here. For now, I'm'just hoping my nexus 6 don't break. Else I might jump on the iOS ship. I'm not convinced the the other android alternatives. Note 8 would be the closest, but touchwiiz, delayed updates.... I'm spoiled after a few years with a nexus. Suicide_Note There always eBay or Swappa if you want to get a first gen Pixel. I was looking at prices over the weekend, and mint condition Pixels are going for about $450. EowynCarter Not so much in France. And eBay for suff that cost more that a few bucks, too risky. Plus, the pixel is getting "old" by now. Wilton Daniel Pinto Troll found trparky Yet Microsoft still supports Windows 7 EIGHT YEARS LATER! How come Microsoft can do that yet Google can't? Alex Louderback Actually, that's Qualcomm EowynCarter Source for this ? trparky And Qualcomm can go fuck themselves. Gee... I wonder why they're being hit with an anti-trust lawsuit. Could this be one of many reasons why? trparky Yes, Google is to blame for that. There's no damn reason why your Nexus 6 can't run Android O other than the fact that they just don't want to. Bojan Bunić My bootloader was unlocked prior to changing the mobo on my 5X, courtesy of Booty Loops. Root, well, probably before I got my Nexus 4. Although I'll see how it'll go on in the future, as we don't have Pixels here, so the only near stock possibility is either OnePlus, or some other device and a custom ROM. Milton P. Agree 100% with you, I mean I remember the old days when I hated HTC's Sense, I literally decided that a phone without a camera was better than whatever HTC did back then, but Android has evolved quite a lot nowadays, don't get me wrong, I do believe that custom ROMs did a great job showing Google what the users want but that won't change, as long as someone shows Google what people want Google will keep improving Android, because there's no limits. Now if they go the Apple way and lock EVERYTHING then we'll be fucked, I'm the meantime developers will find a way around the system pushing Google along. Premsuraj An open bootloader and root actually solves a lot of problems still existing in AOSP. The Nougat update absolutely destoryed the battery life of many Nexus 6P devices, with Google only focussing on the Pixels, there was no fix in it. I unlocked, used Franco Kernel + naptime + Greenify and I now I get adequate battery life. Another feature I can think of is theming. Material design is good, but the whiteness is rage inducing Maxr1998 Well, fuck them. Let's just hope not many devs will use this, and Google won't enable this by default anytime soon. Maxr1998 The more I think about this, the more concerned I get. This will reduce the freedom over our devices, and also limit developers in the awesome things they could do before because of Android's openness. I am all in for device security and fighting against malware, trojans and phishing applications, don't understand me wrong, but that doesn't mean that you have to take people away their freedom - just look at how Linux (GNU and Linux) is doing it. Tom Westrick How does this limit developers? If anything it gives them more control. Maxr1998 Fair point, I should have been more specific. With "developers", I meant rom developers and modders, app developers only if they require root access for their apps. "Normal" developers can use this to enforce a "secure" (read: DRM locked-down) environment, but that's not really a good thing in my opinion.. (Refer to my other comments.) trparky You're angry at the wrong people, you should be angry at Hollywood; they're the ones that are demanding this kind of stuff. Their content, their rules; it's how things are in the real world. They have to do what they need to do to protect their investments, plain and simple. We don't necessarily have to like it, hell... we may even hate it, but that's how it is. You want the content? Play by their rules. Colin Richardson If you are an app developer and want your app to run on custom roms..... don't turn on "Requires SafetyNet"... bekifft We are increasingly living in the future Richard Stallman warned us about. With Google taking all these steps, may as well go back to using jailbroken iPhones. Bart Janusz I've already enabled it and I know at least 3 others devs that did it as well. I really don't care about root per se, but custom roms and xposed is source of countless problem as both are buggy as hell. Maxr1998 But in which way does that influence you? Xposed can introduce bugs to the system, sure, but it won't affect the performance of your app unless it itself is modded, so you probably don't have to fear bad reviews for bad performance anyway. And custom roms? LineageOS on my mother's Moto G runs like a champ and much better than the 5.1 stock rom before. And in my experience as a dev, there were much more incompatibilities with Samsung TouchWiz than with AOSP-based custom roms. refthemc I'm sure he's just trying to avoid the headache of emails he gets daily from users who have no idea that it's their fault the app is not working or crashing... Bart Janusz Indeed, not to mention extra crash and ANRs reports which seems to influence app positioning. Maxr1998 But why? The device may behave more buggy at some parts because of Xposed (and mine definitely ran like shit on MM because of some mods, but I NEVER blamed any apps), but the apps itself won't run worse if not modded - normally they should even run better if you only use performance mods like Greenify, NLP Collector wakelock disabler and other light mods. I don't think he gets many reports anyway, considering what @marcusmarcus2:disqus said. Bart Janusz You may not, but many users do, and as I said there are a lot of bogus ANRs and crash reports. Since my app depends heavily on low level OS elements both custom ROMs and xposed are deal breakers (and you really should check source, since I do not update my website as I moved to G+/FB but app has sizable user base given its niche and I'd to deal with ROM/xposed issues fequently). Maxr1998 Well, but the same type of users also give bad reviews etc. without using any mod or root. You generalize modders to only cause problems, and therefore lock out everyone. About your app/website thing: fair point, I didn't look at it yet, and have to apologize for being a little rude. marcusmarcus2 You need to take your own advice, "you really should check source". If you moved to G+/FB, then why does your app on the play store still point to the same website as well. Or at least put a link on the old website that directs to G+/FB. There is nothing that points to your so called G+/FB source. So @Maxr1998:disqus has no other source to check at the moment. Bart Janusz Not that I care but if you try to draw conclusion about app you should probably visit Play Store listing. Anyhow that's really not important I just chimed in to explain why developer will use this. I've choose to do so due to extra burden which in effect hurts majority of my user base, one of my colleagues cited lucky patcher and freedom (which I think is not such a good idea but its his choice). trparky You may not blame the apps because you know better but most people don't understand that, most people see a crashing app and suddenly you see, as the developer, a ton of comments saying that your app sucks. h4rr4r Please do tell us about your apps so we can be sure to avoid them on any devices we have not yet rooted. marcusmarcus2 His disqus profile leads to this website http://artflowstudio.com/ which has a few apps listed. Art oriented apps. There is only 1 update on that website since 2014, so I don't think I would be to concerned about installing one of his apps. Jordan Palmer Nice detective work. Adrian I can see a lot of refund requests coming from people who paid for apps and suddenly are told "Nope. Not for you anymore." A lot of us are rooted and buy apps and you'd better believe noise will be made if an app I use daily, that I paid for, suddenly breaks with an update because it's no longer blessed by the dev to run on my device. It's your app and you can do what you want with it, but there is always another side to the coin. BAlGaInTl That's not the way that Netflix worked it, and I doubt other developers of paid apps would either. I have a OnePlus One, that I run Lineage OS on since the original Cyanogen OS is now defunct and does not receive any updates. Netflix simply doesn't update to v 5+. It still works just fine. I may not get the newest and latest features, but part of that is on me for using a device that is dated. I'm not one of those users who, because I paid for an app once, fells that I should get all of the updates from now until the end of time. That isn't sustainable for developers. It could very well be that Netflix has some new features/offerings in the works in which they are getting pressure from outside sources to push this. A lot of valid reasons for a developer to enable the check exist. As long as they do it in the same manner that Netflix has, I don't see the issue. Adrian And just like Pokemon Go, eventually you'll get a message that you need to upgrade to the latest version or the app won't work, you know, that new version that won't let you actually log into it anymore. We've already seen this happen so let's not pretend that it isn't the next logical step. They aren't going to keep letting people sign in indefinitely with an app that doesn't have the security level they want. It's naive to think that hey I can just stick with the last version that works for root. It takes all of what, the time it takes to create a switch that says minimum version required to log in is "DRM version" BAlGaInTl Good Point. I recognize that. But it seems that the blame (in general) is being directed at Google in many of these posts. If that scenario happens, it isn't Google that blocked you from accessing Netflix. The need for this level of security is on the increase. The same users demanding better security and longer updates are the first ones to cry foul when Google starts laying the groundwork for exactly what they have asked for. Adrian I think there is a way to do both that doesn't piss off a very active community that helped take Android from a very very very ugly, second class OS to what we have now. I know a lot of us remember just how crippled Android was and it was the root/mod community that produced the bulk of what is now standard on Android. There needs to be a way to secure the devices AND not turn their back on the developer community that contributes. The idea, in Netflix's case, that root = pirate is insane. Why in the world would someone prefer to rip content on their phone to say a computer or XBox that is never going to move and can do it while you get on with your life? They're doing something for the sake of saying they're doing something, but if they think it's going to make a dent in piracy they, and the studios are nuts. I watch a lot of Netflix and still prefer to buy discs. People who do things the right way and are perfectly happy paying for content shouldn't have to jump through hoops to watch it. Those of us who root usually have a handful of things that stock Android is not doing for us. It's why we root. If all of these things were available in stock, my reasons for rooting would disappear but I don't see that happening any time soon. I think Android is getting so much better but if they make it exactly like iOS, might as well go to the dark side because Apple's apps tend to be more polished, come out first and OS updates are frequent. Don't bite the hand that feeds you just because you're getting more popular. BAlGaInTl I think that Netflix is a good example. It is HIGHLY likely that the reason for recent unpopular changes (see also VPN blocking) are being driven by other entities. It isn't that Netflix thinks its a problem, but the people that control a large portion of their content do. root pirate but it does introduce a security risk. I don't see how Google is turning their backs on developers. Developers are free to develop as they see fit and choose (at least for the moment) whether or not they will implement the SafetyNet check. The inherent problem is that a circumvented security is still circumvented and can no longer be considered secure. I can clearly see why some apps would and should frown upon that. Maybe not Netflix and Mario (IMHO), but certainly something like bank and payment apps. I don't think the inherent open nature of android will ever reduce to the level of iOS. But some changes have to occur to meet the needs/desire of the majority. Security is inherently difficult. The easier and more flexible you try to make it, the less secure it becomes. Adrian I do think banking apps should run in a secure space. Completely agree with that, but I disagree with root = less secure. My nexus devices stopped getting OS and security updates. Nothing. VERY insecure and dangerous. I rooted them, updated the OS with images from XDA developers and my devices that were once easy targets are more secure. There is always two sides to it. I see that Google is finally trying to take security seriously on Android and doing things in layers that completely cut out the vendor AND the carriers is the right step. Right now, Root is the only way to update a perfectly good device like my Nexus tablet tablet that the vendor said "oh well" to. Until Google has a REAL strategy in place to keep ALL Android devices secure, root will be necessary. Not everyone wants to or can upgrade devices every two years because they get abandoned. My father doesn't need an S8. He does need a device that gets security updates for more than a year after purchasing his phone. BAlGaInTl You are exactly correct, and I'm in the same situation with my OnePlus One. But in working to increase your security level, you leave holes behind. The key words that you used are "more secure." I agree. You are "more secure." But still (probably) less secure than a device that has been thoroughly tested, certified, and passes SafetyNet without hacks. Google has been open that they are working on security updates. They have improved significantly over the last couple years in getting those out. I feel that they are putting in place a real strategy to keep Android devices secure. This is part of that groundwork. I also feel that they are actively looking to replace Android in it's current state, and I can't say I blame them. The only real strategy may be to take lessons learned and start over. Lucky for them, they have the resources to do so. trparky > take lessons learned and start over Pretty much. The worst thing that they did from the very beginning was to allow for the OEMs to do what they wished. Google essentially made a deal with the devil when they released Android to the world. They wrote no requirements into the Android agreements that the OEMs agreed to to require updates to be a necessary thing. Big mistake Google. BAlGaInTl The really needed to in order to get their foot in the door of the market. If it would not have been open source from the beginning, none of the major manufactures would have bought off on it. The fact that they could use it for free (essentially) and still be able to customize on top of it is what sold it. trparky And now look at it, Android is a fucking mess of non-updated insecure devices that are ripe for anyone to be able to take over and turn into a botnet. trparky And you should be raising holy hell with the OEM that made that device! Just because your device is old doesn't mean that it shouldn't still be supported. Windows 7 is nearly eight years old and it still receives Windows Updates. Why can't your device? BAlGaInTl Normally, I would agree, but the OnePlus One is a special case. The OEM operating system is the now defunct Cyanogen OS. I had to balance having the original OS without updates, or running another with updates. The phone is now almost three years old. If I bought a PC with Windows on it three years ago, and Microsoft had since gone out of business, should the PC manufacturer be responsible for providing Windows 7 updates? Even though the PC is beyond it's support date? Sure, I can increase the security by switching to another OS that is updated. It may even be a Windows clone. But if a software developer decided to only support "original, unmodified" PC configurations, that would be within their right. trparky But it can be adapted to run LineageOS. Sudev There is bit difference in analogy here: OnePlus manufactured the phone and Cynogen Inc customized AOSP Android OS for it, they didn't developed it from ground up. I understand that Cynogen INC is out of business now too. However in PC world, it would be the case that you purchased a PC from Dell and get Microsoft Windows OS with some additional Dell software. If Dell or developer of that custom software goes out of business you still get OS update for your PC. Its not android OS itself out business here. Adrian and for the record, I absolutely agree that it was the content providers and not all on Netflix. trparky You should be demanding that OnePlus send an official update to your device. So what if your device is old? It should be still supported. Windows 7 is still supported nearly eight years later, why can't your device be supported for that long as well? Plumplam Who cares except for a bunch of XDA nerds? If it means better security then I'm all for it. Dmitri Smirnov Well, for starters, it doesn't mean better security, since it does nothing to address the problems with vulnerable outdated android versions that will be "certified", but will allow malicious apps to quietly escalate their privileges and do their dirty work, but will block "uncertified" custom roms that actually have all the recent secuirity patches and give user full control over who has root access and how. Also, "bunch of XDA nerds" are the source of a lot of features that had their trial run in custom ROMs and then were adopted to the AOSP. Should I remind you of "The Oak and the Pig" fable? Alienate the developers bringing new ideas to the ecosystem - lose the competetive edge you had over other OSes saf1927 Actually, custom ROMs never really have the latest security patches despite what they claim since kernels aren't maintained and no proprietary blobs is updated anymore. If ROM developers were OEMs, they'd be violating their agreements with Google by bumping the patch level without actually addressing all the vulnerabilities. Dmitri Smirnov Well they patch the AOSP to the same level as latest official one and kernel - if it's possible to do so without breaking the compatibility with compiled blobs or at least on the level of latest official firmware. So in the end run it's at least as secure as the official firmware, often - much more so. saf1927 If you look at the security bulletin, most vulnerabilities come from proprietary drivers and require these to be updated. On a supported device, these are provided by the chip manufacturers to the OEMs, on an unsupported device they aren't updated anymore. A custom ROM can only fix userspace security issues. In the end, bumping the patch level without addressing all vulnerabilities in that patch gives a false sense of security to users. Dmitri Smirnov If anything, this is an argument for forcing OEMs to opensource their blobs. For some reason community is much better at releasing the fixes for what they can change (userspace), while OEMs generally stop caring as soon as device is out the door. saf1927 The problem goes beyond OEMs unfortunately. All the phones you can buy are assembled with off-the-shelf components that they buy from other manufacturers and it is them that provide the binary blobs to the OEMs. If they stop supporting components, the OEMs can't do anything. For the chip, it's companies like Qualcomm, Samsung, Mediatek etc. that need to support it with up-to-date drivers. Once they stop, the life-cycle of a phone comes to an end. trparky And that is probably one of many reason why Qualcomm is facing a nice fat anti-trust lawsuit. Serves them right. trparky That ain't ever going to happen. There's no way they're going to allow for their intellectual property to be open for all the world to see and have it cracked open. It would be corporate suicide since their competitors would be able to reverse engineer their stuff. Suicide_Note Never heard of "The Oak and the Pig" before. Could you tell me more? Seriously. Dmitri Smirnov http://www.aliceswonderland.eu/Alice-ska350-en.html Maxr1998 Ah, Lessing. Going to read the original version in a minute :) username_not_valid Thats a very generous view of the custom ROM community. It might be true of a few, very few devs, but most ROMs are unsupported garbage with serious security issues. Dmitri Smirnov Maybe so, but out of this cesspool of garbage CyanogenMod was born, which became LineageOS. I'd say their quality standard appeals me more than a lot of OEMs. username_not_valid Cyanogen and Lineage was what i had in mind.. Each to his own i guess. BAlGaInTl Yes and no. I run Lineage on my OnePlus One because Cyanogen OS is no longer supported. I can say with certainty that Lineage introduces stability issues that I have to deal with to be up to date. Wilton Daniel Pinto Ninna pooty bewarci Qwip Consider the bigger picture. Right now, users are being shuffled into a situation where they must restrict the control they have over their device if they want to be able to use Netflix (and presumably banking apps will follow soon). That may seem fine, and from some security perspective it is probably a good thing. How much control do you have over your _laptop_? How much do you want? Right now, we're blissfully able to install unsigned software on our computers (although various OSs will complain about it), but will that last? How long will it be before we can only open our banking interface on our laptop using a trusted, digitally signed browser on a machine that is using secure boot and can only run signed binaries? I can understand the direction that Netflix (and others) are coming from, and to them it may even make sense. The question is: what is the cost of ceding control over our devices/machines in order to be able to watch netflix, etc. trparky Yeah and that's why Windows is the virus filled cesspool that it is today. Windows 10 is slowly changing Windows to be an app store based ecosystem in which all apps will be sandboxed. It's coming to the desktop near you. saf1927 I hope Magisk (or other similar mods in the future) keep working, so to prevent this. Not a problem on my Pixel XL since I haven't rooted it, but on my Nexus 5 Magisk allows it to pass Safety Net even though it's running a custom ROM (7.1.2) and it's rooted. Hendrik Leppkes SafetyNets primary purpose is to secure devices for Android Pay, and when you deal with actual money transactions on your device, you really don't want any hack interfering with it - so I'm quite certain they'll do whatever they can to break hacks like this and ensure the security and integrity of the device. h4rr4r No, its primary purpose is to make the device trustworthy for others not the person who paid for it. This is how it makes it "secure" for android pay. You are a possible threat and this closes that. Suicide_Note It would seem that Google is erecting a wall around their garden, too. EowynCarter While Apple opens iOS more and more. YouNex According to the support/help page, a device is not certified if it stops getting Android updates. How fuck up is that ? I don't get it. My Moto X has always been on stock ROM, yet it's showing up as non certified. Yes it's rooted + system modifications, but at no point is it stated that root prevents it from being certified. Suicide_Note Really? You can't understand why your rooted/system modified device is non-certified? YouNex I know how to read, but this is vague https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/b6f710b8628f0e09ab73ba144c133a2c9b1fe1325b353ae7dc1636f2776b2ac0.png "Not secure" jonzey231 Root and/or unlocked bootloader = Not certified. YouNex It says nothing about root or bootloader https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/b6f710b8628f0e09ab73ba144c133a2c9b1fe1325b353ae7dc1636f2776b2ac0.png ast00 Can't wait until LastPass excludes root users... Fuck them. Adonis K. If they do, I'm cancelling my subscription... Naxx ENVY Fuck them and yet they haven't done anything yet ... #internetlogic Also i know right , crazy for a company that stores your passwords to make themselves more secure . ABSOLUTE CRAZY , RAGE RAGE RAGE Jordan Palmer I don't understand your reasoning or rationale for these two statements. ast00 The second part is related to Google. Sorry about the confusion. Believe it or not, most of us root users keep SELinux in it's Enforcing state. This means we are safe. Nothing gets root rights without us knowing. Our phones are just as safe if not safer than most stock phones. JATIN BANSAL SafetyNet test can be passed using Magisk Manager. I am using it and it works fine for me. Even in play store, my device is certified. May be this helps someone. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/3756499ff5876545740cd0e88e38961bb2c327d90fc43f5801f4bce5d802c990.png https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/44185f640490cb506a68a3414579bd345123f7d52ee2e11802d31d5141db11ae.png Nick Most people are worried about the future when the exploits that Magisk uses are patched and it continues to make it harder for people to get around this. JATIN BANSAL That's what I am also worried about. I just posted this for those who are already rooted and for now want to keep the root. My main purpose of rooting was to flash lineage OS. I think custom rom is the only way of staying updated to latest version of Android as google itself doesn't update their phones after 2 years (18 months I think) for reasons they have. I think if someone buys a flagship device which costs 700$+, it should have 3-4 years of full software update support. 😆😄 2 years of major OS version updates and 3 years of security patches. After 3 years, its time to buy a new phone cuz its so old anyway. trparky Says you! Windows 7 was released on July 22, 2009 and they still support it EIGHT YEARS LATER! And they plan on supporting it until the year 2020 which means it will be supported for a total of ELEVEN YEARS! If Microsoft can do it, Google can too!!! Does Microsoft suddenly say "Your machine is too old, go buy a new one"? No, they continue to give you Windows Updates for years later. We should also be demanding that the Android OEMs do so as well. A Samsung Note 5 has more than enough hardware in it to run Android 7 but no... we can't do that, we need to make money so we don't update them to force you to buy a new device. Lambdadelta Magisk...alright, thanks for the tip-off. I really must get it. TadMSTR Magisk doesn't always pass SafetyNet. I have some devices it fails on. However, several other devices it works just fine. Make sure you turn on the hide root option, it's off by default. Lambdadelta Well, I do have a problem, and that is my device is not able to download it directly from Google Play, so I have to get the APK from XDA. I dunno why this is the case for my phone though. Is it because it's a 4.4.4? Either way, I'll get the APK moved to my phone later tonight. Teodor Axel Johan Jönsson I have activated hide root option, and it passes SafetyNet, but in Google Play Store, it still shows uncertified. What app should I hide root from to get Play Store to show Certified? JATIN BANSAL As per XDA: Q: Safety Net fails after enabling MagiskHide A: Magisk can only hide Magisk core features, for Magisk modules it depends on what the module does. If your ROM itself is not able to pass SafetyNet, then there is nothing Magisk can help. Your best bet is 100% stock ROMs, because your phone manufacturer is forced to release a device passing CTS. Teodor Axel Johan Jönsson What in Magisk Hide did you check/how did you do it? Google Play Store? Or Play services? Because here it says uncertified :( JATIN BANSAL Just clear app data of play store. Now it will show your device certified Teodor Axel Johan Jönsson Thanks! Muzaffar I believe that root and custom rom makes android what it is now. This feels like betrayal for Android enthusiast. username_not_valid Well maybe in the very early days (maybe), but not any more. Rooted phones make up a tiny fraction of active devices. Muzaffar It's not about active devices. It's about how android develop together with community (well as i remember) I believe that those "rooted user" contribute many things that make android right now. I still remember status bar (and nav bar) color change was implemented on Kitkat before it becomes official on lollipop. Also, we can't forget how badly mobile active network bug happens in lollipop if it's not those "rooted user" who found out the fix via xposed. and i believe there are still more. trparky We can blame the OEMs for that kind of stuff because of things like locked bootloaders, eFuses, etc. username_not_valid Or we can blame ROM makers for it because they kept breaking the devices causing warranty claims. Naxx ENVY no offence but that's small thinking ... i'd say 90% of people on Android devices don't want or even know about root, heck it may even be 95% ... security is more of a concern, sure it annoys us geeks, but that's the 5% at most. Muzaffar And about half of android devices is left outdated. Not to mention bugs that unsolved on previous android. I'll pick a dumb phone instead, if android becomes a closed platform. trparky And truth be told that's why I have an iPhone. I simply got sick and tired of the lack of updates so I told myself I'm going to the iPhone and have been happy ever since. OK sure, it may not have all of the customization features that Android has but I can be guaranteed that I will get software and security updates on time, every time, regardless of my carrier of choice. refthemc I think you misread his comment, he's saying that root and custom roms got Android to where it is TODAY not saying that it is necessary TODAY. And I agree. trparky It pretty much comes down to this. Google is simply targeting a much larger piece of the pie. You can't blame them for trying to do what is necessary to protect not only the platform but the Android brand itself. Qwip Well, it isn't like there is anywhere else to go though, is it? Google can basically throw enthusiasts who have promoted and fostered android development under the bus - they don't need them any more. trparky Money trumps community. Always has, always will. username_not_valid Ad blocking was the last holdout reason to root for me, but even thats no longer a good reason with things like Adhell, Adguard etc I have no other reason to root now, custom ROMs are generally garbage, and bloat can usually be uninstalled or disabled, so its just not needed. Adonis K. custom ROMs have nothing to do with root... thevigilante Custom ROMs have uncertified flag in Play Store Mike Avellanosa Not all, though George Byers My Nexus 7 2013 is passing safteynet running Lineage unrooted. Wilton Daniel Pinto Let me guess, you have a Pixel. Or you wouldn't call custom ROMs bloated while the reality is other way round username_not_valid Wouldn't touch a Pixel actually. username_not_valid Should be noted that I didn't call custom ROMs bloated, I guess you misread it. Wilton Daniel Pinto Oh yeah, I misread it . My bad Zach Mauch This is going to cause the same problem I see in governments work with security. They will blindly block things like root and bootloader unlock regardless of if it poses any credible threat because it FEELS more secure. Blah!!!!!! Naxx ENVY it IS more secure, not just " feels" h4rr4r More secure for them, not for me the owner of the device. Besides, not even for them in the long term. An up to date ROM has many exploits patched that a two versions out of date and 12 months behind on security patches OTA has. Zach Mauch What I mean is they will apply restrictions because they easily can and it gives a warm fuzzy for them. They will do this regardless of the impact to the user. The analogy here is that in my job I am constantly unnecessary restrictions and bureaucracy that make doing my job much more difficult. For instance, we are disallowed from using remote desktop on standalone computer networks. It would make our job MUCH MUCH easier in many circumstances and save money on software as I could remote into my PC from anywhere in the building. Yet they deny us that and claim security. jonzey231 So this will force people to install apps from unauthorized sources, thus making the whole Android malware issue that much more prevalent. Great.. Suicide_Note Unless being held at gunpoint, no one is forced to install apps from unauthorized sources. That's a user's CHOICE. jonzey231 You know what I mean. Stop playing devil's advocate on everyone's posts. Eric Braun He's not incorrect. Kyle R Krcmaric "Stop providing an alternate viewpoint to my own." It's just comments. Anyway, I think Google also announced that even sideloaded apps will get scanned by their new Google Play Protect service, which may help nullify the risk of sideloading in the first place. d0x360 That's not an alternate viewpoint unless your view is "don't install any apps ever" There is no logical argument to defend this move by Google. None. username_not_valid Yes there is. Come content creators will not allow a provider to support a rooted or otherwise compromised device. Right or wrong in your eyes thats the reality, and in order for Android to be able to have such services Google have to do this. d0x360 What you said isn't an alternate viewpoint lol you are just repeating the reason Google is doing this which everyone agrees is a fact. As for this new comment...a rooted phone isn't compromised. Tell me...what would a rooted user do with Netflix that would make Netflix want to block them? Are they worried about people copying movies because if they think Android is the vector for that action they are idiots. All they are doing is making a problem by allowing bad actors to inject malware into a Netflix apk that could be installed by both root and unrooted users. Genius! Give me 1 good reason to block rooted phones from an app like oh I dunno, Mario run or whatever it's called. Any answers you give are false. Wanna know why? Hacked apks exist to allow cheating and they can be installed by anyone rooted or not. In fact I'd stake my life that your average unrooted user is installing more modified apk files to cheat in games or whatever than any rooted user. People who root are generally better educated about the Android eco system and do less dumb stuff. As for Netflix I cancelled my account on the day they did this and now I just use a friends account so they lost a subscriber due to this move and I rarely ever used the app. Sure 1 person closing an account that's existed since the day they opened isn't going to do much but I vote with my wallet and if a company does something I dislike then they simply don't get my money. The first person I asked gave me their login info and I made a profile. It's just like how I share my HBO subscription with someone else. Easy easy. username_not_valid See my previous comment. Its not for me to argue, the fact is content providers want it, fair or not, end of story, therefore its going to happen. The tiny number of rooters out there are meaningless to them, and Google. Netflix has to do this because the providers of its non-original content demand it. Its not Netflix fault, they either do it or lose shows. Losing large amounts of their content would affect their subscription base several orders of magnitude more than losing rooted users, who chances are, use the service on more than their phone or tablet anyway. d0x360 Once again I ask... what about a rooted device is dangerous to an app and also this is now a second question, what makes it compromised? BAlGaInTl Clearly you've made up your mind on the issue, but I'll give it a go. It isn't necessarily the root that is dangerous to an app or vice versa. The compromise comes from other apps/processes that can take advantage of root. If you don't understand that, then you don't understand what root really is. It has a lot of valuable uses, but it can also be dangerous. To address your previous statement, just because it rubs me the wrong way. So your "solution" was to cancel your Netflix account and then steal the content? So clearly, you aren't "actually" affected by the change, because you can still watch Netflix. You do realize that watching their content is also valuable to them and makes them money? If you want to boycott Netflix for their practices, then by all means do. Otherwise, it just comes across as hypocritical IMHO. d0x360 I don't believe I asked you. No I'm not stealing Netflix content, it's being paid for and Netflix has many times in the past encouraged account sharing. Of course they did so in the hopes you would join but they still allow it. I paid my Netflix dues. Day 1 4 disc member, then as soon as it was available I upgraded to the 4k 4 user package. It's not piracy either, I'm not recording or distributing the content. If Netflix wants to dick with me I'll dick with them. I never said this was permanent but I vote with my wallet. Vote cast. I also haven't used Netflix once since that day despite being able to. I've been using Amazon and Microsoft video where I own over 500 movies so you can stuff the whole theft argument. I've bought more content than most and that doesn't include my DVD, Blu-ray, and uhd Blu-ray collection which is well over 1400 movies and TV shows at this point. Your right...I've been rooting since the first Android phone but I totally don't understand the possibilities. My argument is simple. The overwhelming majority of root users don't mess with apps. To hell with that nonsense argument anyways. What is the danger to Netflix? Copying movies? Please...it's a million times easier to do it on a PC. Even windows xp can handle it without issue. Does Netflix and you I suppose really think root users are using the app to steal content? If so how? Show me one forum topic, one article, one modified Netflix apk that allows downloading and bypassing their drm. I'm begging you. Just 1. BAlGaInTl I reviewed the Netflix TOS, and I will agree that you are not stealing. I'll even remove the verbiage from my post. Netflix does not make any such stipulation. They speak only of the "Account Owner" and "Devices." I guess I just assumed that, and that's my bad. As I've said in other posts... It isn't all about Netflix. A large part of it is about their content. They really can't argue that point with providers. You either play by their rules, work to establish new rules, or choose not to carry them. Netflix wants to stay relevant on all platforms. That's the main danger to Netflix. In addition, I shouldn't have to give an example in the wild of an exploit. Just because it is difficult to find doesn't mean it doesn't exist. What if someone else writes an app that uses root to mine user account data from Netflix? Should Netflix not be worried about protecting user data? If that happens, who is responsible for the security and the bad press? Probably not Netflix, but they would certainly be impacted. I checked my app really quick (which is stuck on version 4 because I'm affected). Since Netflix keeps you logged in for convenience (that's spelled out in their terms), a quick look gives my full name, username, phone number, zip code, the brand of payment card, and the last 4 digits of that card. That's quite a bit of information that can easily be gathered by a piece of Malware. Now as I said... Netflix probably wouldn't be liable if a user was compromised because of root. It would certainly be a danger to their business however. Why should the be asked to take that risk? It seems to me that they are approaching this in a realistic manner, and rolling it out in a reasonable way. Would this affect the majority of root users? Probably not. By their nature, root users will find ways around it anyway. The problem is that the impact to Netflix from losing content and/or a compromised app is disproportionate the loss of blocking root users. It's simply a numbers game, and you can't blame Netflix for that. And you certainly can't blame Google who is trying to improve security. username_not_valid Thats not for me to decide, or argue, the fact is the content providers have decided that rooting is a risk to their copyrighted content, and as such services like Netflix, Amazon, and other streaming services must comply and lock out rooted devices. Passing safetynet and using Googles DRM framework is the easiest way to claim due diligence, so thats what they will do, and in order to keep Android competitive Google is providing the tools needed to make it possible. What I will argue though is that your notion that custom ROMs etc are more secure is unfounded. The best might well be, but there are hundreds of completely random and unchecked ROMs out there that could contain absolutely anything, you cant possibly claim that custom ROMs are inherently safer or more secure than OEM ROMs, outdated or not. jonzey231 So let's play this out: If someone takes the Netflix .apk and mods it with malware and then signs it, it will pass installation on the device. 1. User opens app. 2. App does whatever shitty thing it's designed to do while the user thinks they just got around the block. 3. The OS scans the app and warns the user it's been modified and they should uninstall it. 4. User thinks "Ha! I know and that's why it works!" 5. User keeps app until they get a call from Credit Karma that their identity was probably stolen but they don't know how. 6. Person spends 6 months fixing stolen identity. But still uses that app the whole time. Ultimately, that user is still going to be screwed. Would you or I make this mistake? No. Would your cousin's friend's dad because he had his son root so he could tether for free and overheard you guys talking about sideloading apps and googled how to do it? Yes. Randroid Problem is, even in your scenario, root has nothing to do with it. Someone who is not rooted could do the same thing. The only problem is, now MORE people who root are going to be *forced* to look for a modified apk because the official apk is not available from the Play Store. So in the end, it's causing more problems than it's fixing. Corbin Baxter Here's the thing about rooting: when you alter your devices software like that, then Google shouldn't be responsible for anything that comes afterwards for the user. This just helps discourage rooting, which can alter a new users perspective on Android, or make someone reconsider getting an Android device. someone755 For what it's worth, back in 2011/2010, many of us bought into Android *because* we could root. Imagine the possibilities of being in control of so much more of your system than with any mobile OS prior; We've spent hundreds (some, thousands) of dollars in this environment, on devices, apps, books etc. I understand this isn't how things stand nowadays, but root is still prevalent because of one issue that Google will not fix (or at least, won't until O+ is running on the majority of devices, but that'll take two years at the minimum), and those are updates and vendor apps (i.e. bloatware). If my phone is stuck on Lollipop I'm going to root it; I'll be able to mitigate the memory leak performance drops, and overall customize the device to fit my specific needs -- I've made quite a few friends (think ROM and kernel devs) because I just wanted to put a thermal engine better than Qualcomm's horrendous MPDecision into the kernel directly (i.e. I took the kernel source and modified it to fit my needs). What Google is trying to do here is, yes, discourage rooting, but instead of fixing the root cause (heh) behind why people root in the first place (that is, again, customizability and personal(ized) performance tuning, in large part to keep devices on older Android versions alive), root wouldn't be necessary. In the long run this *might* fix the symptom, but it most definitely will not help in fixing the cause. And that's because the cause is Google itself. As if apps like Snapchat blocking power users from their apps wasn't enough, now there's this -- If it becomes so common that even Google's own apps start to utilize the feature, I'll be gone to another mobile platform within a month. That might mean iOS, it might mean S60v3, I'll know that if (or rather, when) it happens. tl;dr: Google is putting a band-aid on a shotgun wound. Corbin Baxter I'm speaking mainly for new Android users. They don't feel as comfortable rooting. Doing this makes Android SEEM more like iOS. This doesn't MAKE Android like iOS. New users are comfortable with that. This is the same issue Microsoft had with Windows 8/8.1. Classic users, and Windows enthusiasts, hated someone changing the way they would use their computers. Microsoft introduced a different way of doing things, and to enthusiasts, it was bad, no matter how good it might be. Google's Project Treble should mostly fix the fragmentation problem, therefore giving Android users one less reason to root. To us enthusiasts, nothing can beat rooting, but it might not be the best solution to the problems Android has. Google seems intent on fixing the problems rooting tries to solve, but in a higher-quality and reliable way. No hard feelings😉 trparky They won't understand that, they're too blinded by their geek rose colored glasses. Corbin Baxter I don't expect everyone to understand, but I'll be happy if even a small handful understand what Google is doing here. Dmitri Smirnov > when you alter your devices software like that, then Google shouldn't be responsible for anything that comes afterwards for the user. As if right now Google or the OEMs are in any ways responsible for the malware or unpatched firmware vulnerabilities that stay this way for year. But yes, the users that root are the problem. Corbin Baxter For unrooted phones, yes Google and OEMs are very responsible. But after you root, Android loses most of its security and stability, and rooting is basically tinkering with core system files. Google doesn't have any control over what the user can or can't do after that. bekifft That wasn't even a devil's advocate, that was a straight up strawman. Frosted Butts Yes.. please tell me about all the Netflix alternatives i can install, that can legally stream from Netflix...... Right now, if i am rooted and want Netflix (a service i am paying for), i must go through 3rd party app stores to install the APK. There is no choice at all... R Firestone ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ Umm you have the choice to unroot your device. Maxr1998 ..which is a bad choice for many. d0x360 Yes you do except I rooted my device to make it MORE secure. Unrooting would make my device less secure than sideloading apps would. username_not_valid People can keep saying that, but the content providers have no way to know whether or not you have taken measures to secure your custom device, whereas if they go down this root they know its handled. BAlGaInTl "whereas if they go down this root they know its handled" I see what you did there. 😆😄 ...or just watch Netflix from Chrome! You could even do this from a Linux box with root! 😃 Suicide_Note Sure there is: unroot. Problem solved. neoKushan "I've solved this problem by creating 3 more problems - but it IS solved!" Eric Braun https://www.amazon.com/Netflix-Inc/dp/B005ZXWMUS Option C .. ?? h4rr4r A choice that is now more popular. dcdttu It's not so much about what a user chooses to do. It's about probability. The probability that sites are going to try to lure users into downloading malware-infected Netflix APKs from 3rd party sites is going to go up if you can't download it from a safe source in the first place. This is just like the fact that, if you don't give drug users a safe and clean place to shoot up, they're going to go do it somewhere else that's much more dangerous. Both of these scenarios are bad for society in general, no matter what the original intention was. kgptzac 1/10. Gotta try harder. Premsuraj How? Google Play Protect will still catch malicious apps makapav Yes but you're potentially making people venture through shady sites to get the APKs. Eric Braun Or to Amazons App store or Fdroid. The people going to shady sites are already going there, this isn't going to increase the traffic by any real amount. tehboogieman Are you sure that Google will continue allowing GPP for unlocked or rooted users going forward? Not to mention that it's not a silver bullet for 0days d0x360 It barely works as is. There are tons of apps that slip through every day. Krebs on security reports on them quite frequently. I don't trust Google's scanning of apps at all which is why I root. I can make my phone more secure and I can also image the device as often as I want so if something does happen it's fixed within 5 min. If I unroot then I lose the protection along with the backups. Premsuraj Custom ROMs and root can't protect from 0days either. And just out of curiosity how is root going to provide more security? If anything it makes the device less secure tehboogieman Nobody said root makes a device more secure. Blocking root users from downloading apps from the Play Store puts users at more risk since those users will be more inclined to sideload apps from sources that might not be as reliable as the Play Store. Premsuraj The only people who cares about this are the people who root. And those user's generally tend to be more knowledgeable about what kind of apps and app stores they can trust. ASYOUTHIA✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ And only <2% of users will do this to keep rooted. xxTheGoDxx Only the plus 50 - 100 Million users that have root: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=eu.chainfire.supersu ASYOUTHIA✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ You do realize that that's just downloads right? ...not active users. blindexecutioner I'm not mad. I continue to use things like magisk to help get around stuff like this. All this will do is encourage me to use unauthorized sources for offending apps if magisk ever stops working. There is a reason I use Android over iOS and it certainly isn't because the apps are better designed or whatever. brian. Magisk is a good way around this. However, I don't know how long this will last. I would think with security in mind and developers trying to monetize more, it will put pressure on Google to make SafetyNet get triggered much easier. Obviously, I don't have any way of knowing, but this could easily turn into a cat and mouse game more than it already is. Android Pay was first, other apps did it like Super Mario Run, which who cares, but now Netflix? Changes are coming, and it doesn't look good for the rooting community. D13H4RD2L1V3 I'm not sure if everyone gets why some of us went through the trouble of gaining SU access. Sure, maybe there's a few who went through all that trouble for nefarious purposes (and maybe that got regulatory bodies concerned to the point where Google even needed to consider this) but from my perspective at least, a lot of us gain Superuser access mainly to get features that we liked on other Android flavors, especially in the case of a build of Android that's very close to Google's vision. Such as the ability to hide the navbar at any time we wanted and also to gain theming support (which I feel should be added officially sooner rather than later because I absolutely hate how Google is making their already-bright UI even more eye-searing with even more white-colored elements, which also makes the benefits of OLED much less obvious). I wouldn't be as concerned if these features were pushed to AOSP soon, but as it stands, I feel that Google should probably think about making these features available soon. Marty Thank the bad apples for why you no longer have freedom. Jeremy ディリマ Would changing region firmware with Odin flag the SafetyNet check on Samsung mobiles? Soz if it's a stupid question a lot has changed since I last fiddled with Android Christopher Robert This was a long time coming. Once root user started using root to pirate software, and/or get around geo locks, instead of using it to add feature to their firmware or improve their devices performance, it was only a matter of time before it all got torn down. h4rr4r Get around geo locks? You mean have my device report the location I want it to report? Yeah, how terrible that I control what my computer does. dizel123 You still do. This doesn't affect that at all h4rr4r You said the justification for that was people using their devices for their own reasons in the way they liked. I was pointing out that this is a normal thing and not something that should be punished. Cuvis You don't need root to pirate. You never did. Marty Apple says, Thank you. h4rr4r Sounds like we need a new FREE platform. Maybe Amazon can use this to push their store. mxwp but will the Netflix from the Amazon App Store work on rooted phones? Curt RIP Root. I'm not moving from stock anymore, just cab with the hassle. Until there's a 'reliable' way to hide from Safety Net, I'll enjoy my Android Pay, banking apps and overall smoothness. (If it was up to me, I'd be rooted with Linage) h4rr4r IOS is the platform for you. That was the deal from the beginning. hp-fourtwenty magisk....giyf .y phone is rooted with lineage 14.1, and passes safetynet. problem solved! jcopernicus Fantastic news. Lawstorant All this butthurt for what? You all sound like Magisk doesn't exist. Dave Hamilton Lets take Apple and there closed source. Lets take Google and there open source, the freedom to do and change as you please to make the device yours. No two devices have to be the same. Lets get 115 million android users, and then start deciding you no longer have this choice and freedom to do what you want! When something gets better and better, its only a matter of time before all the things you love are removed and comersilised Eric Braun You still have the option to do what you want. However like everything there are reactions for every action. Want to root or unlock your device? Sure, however there may be a few apps that no longer appear in the playstore. May want to have a backup like Amazon App Store or something similar ready. No one is stopping you, feel free to do as you please. tehboogieman Man, if I have to choose between having a device with root or a device with apps that use day to day, the iPhone goes from a 1% chance of being my daily driver to about 50% There are still a lot that can Android can do that iOS can't, but if I'm living in a walled garden the iPhone is looking pretty attractive. 5+ years of official OS support, solid retail network for quick service or hardware exchanges. The Play Store is my main source of apps that I know are vetted and generally safe. I have no desire to manage app updates manually. There is always a chance that someone will build and maintain an appstore that will have all root blocked apps (maybe the future of APKMirror?). If not it might be the death of Android for users like me Eric Braun Even without all of this I would use an APKMirror App that allowed for updating of apps automatically. dizel123 Google gives app developers more control over their apps. Whiny entitled internet crybabies go on the internet and whine and cry. Aka...Thursday neoKushan Alternatively: Google restricts users from using their device, which they own, how they see fit. dizel123 Except Google isn't restricting anyone from doing anything. But being 100% wrong has never stopped anyone in the internet NubCake being an asshole (in your case) hasn't stopped anyone from commenting eather it seems. dizel123 I can admit to being an asshole. But I'm also right so it's all good. neoKushan It's certainly not stopping you. dizel123 I haven't experienced it so of course it's not stopping me trparky You may own the hardware but you don't own the software, you only have a license to use it. Csöpi Thats so greate. I have a stock oneplus one and for some strange reasons i was failing the test beforhand, but now its all green. Still cant update the netflix app hence chromecast isnt working either anymore. Not really happy. JC If there's a will there's a way. brian. If more developers get on board with this, I can't see why I would switch to Android. I've always been curious about new Android phones, bought a bunch and rooted them all if I could. This is not good for a person like me. d0x360 If Google keeps this up and app devs include the api to block rooted phones then my days using Android will be over and Google will have lost a user who's been there since the g1. I don't know what I'd switch to... probably windows mobile because I'm not a fan of apple whatsoever. It's really a shame because if I had to guess I'd say 99.99% of people who root do so for either the added security and or customized experiences. For example I use root to modify my status bar and quick panel as well as firewall my apps and use adaway and yes Google I do whitelist sites that aren't obnoxious with their ads. John Doe All the more reason for the APK mirror appstore LoL Jan-Lk Else Yeah Google want's us to buy tooooo expensive phones to just get the latest Android, because cheap phones suck at updates and so they need to be flashed and rooted... trparky But if the community raises holy hell with the OEMs then maybe it will be corrected. There's no damn reason why a three year old device can't be updated when an eight year old Windows 7 machine is still receiving Windows Updates. McStagger WHY DOES NETFLIX CARE IF THE PHONE IS ROOTED?!?!?!?! mxwp Netflix does not care, but the content creators that make the stuff you see on Netflix do care. They care because they are idiots who think it is easier to pirate from rooted phones. bekifft Again, Google becomes more and more restrictive. I switched from iPhone because the screens were too small, and Google was far less restrictive. Both of those issues are now resolved, and Google's upped the price of their device to match Apple. May as well switch back to iPhone, Google seems to support it just as much as Android anyway. Luxferro Except it's not just rooted users! Any device with an unlocked bootloader. hp-fourtwenty Your comment sucks for misinforming users about what safetynet is....has NOTHING to do with unlocked bootloaders. Luxferro Sure it does. My Nexus 6P only has an unlocked bootloader, and Netflix disappeared from the play store after the last update. And I'm not the only one, so I suggest you do some reading. TechGuy22 more reason for me to pirate hey, have at it Matías Duarte I hope Netflix does the same with Jailbroken iOS devices. Why they do this btw? To prevent people recording their movies? You can do that with Windows.. Knowledgeborn Allah In all honesty, that'll probably never happen. Jailbreaking iOS opens the doors to a lot of customization on an iPhone, but the security issues are often minimal (with the exception being not having the latest software version). Jailbreaking is pretty much filtered through the Cydia platform. You don't have access to the entire system with a jailbreak. Rooting is completely different, because you can completely reshape the core OS. fbl Note : I don't work for Netflix so I can't comment for them. Possible causes : - the right holders might be pushing for this. I work on roughly the same product area and we don't implement DRM because we like them, we implement them because we contractually have to. -Netflix is tired of getting low notes because of crashes coming by shitty hacks in custom roms. Zach Mauch Anyone know how chromebooks will be affected by this? Will dev mode being enabled cause you to fail SafetyNet Checks? That is currently the only way to install apks on Chromebooks. Branko But Android AOSP!11 -Google 2011 How the times how changed. Wayne Randall ALT arguement, because I don't have time to read every comment... This doesn't limit me and my rooted N6P at all, this move limits how much money they (the devs and Google) are going to make. I can't buy it (the app or coins, or special characters, or bonus content, w/e) if I can't see it. Plain and simple. The important apps will still be there. No app is worth unroot. Block Project Fi from root though... weeeellll. I guess I'd unroot for that. mxwp yeah, only Netflix, banks, and big names will use these blocks. i am guessing most devs want as much exposure as possible. PVL_93_RU Google is actively trying to kill the modding community. Not the Custom ROM makers, but people who root and install Xposed. All because they compromise the security for Android Pay I fear the day root and Xposed apps start disappearing from the Play Store trparky If it comes to security vs being open, security will always win (or at least should always win). Eric Koop I had my Shaw Gateway app update yesterday and they changed it so it doesn't work if rooted. So I had to uninstall and find an APK online of an older version. Now it's just a matter of time before I forget and re-install the update. What a pain... disqus_em5YfkbWdk Well this would certainly get me to cancel Netflix. My personal Plex server is far better than Netflix could ever be anyway. Vivek Rameses Becoming apple more and more every day. Disgusting. Knowledgeborn Allah Android is starting to look more and more like iOS with each update... ¯_(ツ)_/¯ trparky Open platforms rarely stay open once the Benjamins start rolling in. hp-fourtwenty Go ahead and block me...I'll just pirate your app. Play nice and so will I. Start poking me and I'll poke back by never giving you another penny. App devs can't beat XDA devs. It's not going to happen. My unlocked, rooted, rommed and modded device still passes safety net. The day that stops, so does the flow of money leaving my hands on the play store. Luxferro Lay off the sodas.... UniBroW Question, can those of you without access to Netflix on Google play, can it be installed from the Amazon App Store? Stanley C. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/dd381b7e8a39df74c4725712a0db906098c965e9ee4194b6e01e020fd69ee566.png Thats how magisk is made... Magic! Marti Abernathey Yawn. I've got a rooted device and just installed Netflix... because? Magisk. As soon as they made this choice I cancelled. Not because I can't get around it, but because they make me do that. mrjayviper even on a non-rooted LOS mis 5s+, I cannot install Netflix. unlocking the bootloader already tripped safety. And I don't want to root. The features available in non-rooted LOS is enough for me. Teh BuG No. Bueno. TedPhillips Sigh. What's the over-under on this becoming pervasive in the play store... MicroG / Fdroid I'm coming soon. World needs a solid single alternative gcm replacement to catch on. TedPhillips As far as the potential for support overhead, being rooted is generally less than the pain coming from the Xposed/magisk crowd. You need to be actively interfering with an app via root vs code being injected into low levels of the framework that everything uses. TedPhillips I think the best outcome could be that Google opens up their process for little guys to certify there own rom builds, ala let's encrypt lowering friction on getting ssl setup. AOSP should not be a functionally useless base implementation for I'm roms, but something you can use in​ practice. TedPhillips Hey guys, don't worry. Google says Android is for everyone. https://www.android.com/everyone/ That includes AOSP developers too, right? That website seems to tread the line pretty carefully, ala 'no one is forcing you use Google play' but Hiroshi's quote seems like it comes with a grain of salt since he owns Play. I'd love to see AP interview him about this. qkjDlav As an app developer for a large app used globally, the two biggest time wasters in a developer's life are a) debugging device specific issues (HTC, Samsung, etc) and b) crash logs with Xposed in the stack trace. Developers are tired of having to sit around with device farms at their desks just to make sure new features and changes work with each quirky variant of Android that manufacturers want to deploy, and custom roms do make it worse. Enthusiasts are welcome to customize their own versions of Android and sideload apps, but we don't want to see crashlogs in the Developer Console from rooted/custom ROM users. And companies probably don't want to keep paying us to debug issues that only a small minority of users will see. Lê Nguyên Chương Most stupid thing I've ever heard in my life.

MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif.—Compared to the pruned and controlled garden of iOS, Android has a reputation for being like the Wild West. But that hasn't been true for some time, as Google's security team highlighted here at I/O. Amidst a slew of other announcements at the annual developers conference, Google Play Protect flew under the radar. But the core of the service had been in development for a few years, said Google's head of Android security, Adrian Ludwig. Google now scans over a billion devices for potential security vulnerabilities; each day, 20,000 dedicated processors scour 500,000 apps for potential malware. While sticking to apps from the Google Play Store is much safer than side-loading apps from other sources (95 percent safer, Ludwig says), Google also provides protection for users who download apps from third-party stores. The service, called Safety Net, has been in operation for years, and extends protection to those without it. It also helps ensure that Android users in countries where the Google Play Store is not in operation have some modicum of protection. Did you know about any of this? Odds are you didn't. Unless you carefully follow Google announcements, or attend Ludwig's talks at security conferences (where this writer first heard of the program), you probably assumed that Android's Wild West reputation was well deserved. Google Play Protect aims to rectify that. It's simply a new section in the Google Play app store that shows your apps have been scanned by Google and that all is well. As before, the OS will alert you if it detects something untoward, but Play Protect is a new direction for Android Security. "The other thing we've been recognizing is that we just name things wrong," said Ludwig. He was referencing a tool in the Google Play store called Android Device Manager. Once activated, it can be used to find a device's physical location on a map and take action to secure a lost device remotely. Going forward, the tool will be rebranded as Find My Device, which will hopefully better communicate its function to users. Find My Device also now shows battery status for your gadgets, and can track them in the background. This last point lets you see where your device was last detected before its battery ran out or it went offline. O Say, Can You Secure Enhanced security will also figure prominently in Android O, according to Xiaowen Xin from Google's Android security team. O will expand its use of verified boot, a process by which the device checks the cryptographic keys at every stage of the boot process. Android devices can then determine if they were rolled back to a previous, more vulnerable version of the OS and prevent booting. Android O will also support tamper-resistant hardware. Similar to the EMV chips found in modern credit cards, this chip can authenticate a user's PIN, pattern lock, or password, Xin explained. The permissions model for Android O has also been tweaked to make it harder for malicious apps to abuse the permissions granted by users. In a specific move against ransomware, Android O uses new permissions for specific activities that allowed attackers to take control of the phone's screen and demand ransom. Those avenues will be closed, effectively defanging Android ransomware. Similarly, the Device Admin permission—which previously granted apps a wide latitude of control—has been greatly reduced in an effort to prevent abuse. Better, Broader Updates Additional hardware isolation comes to Android O in the form of Project Treble. This expands on the existing sandbox framework, which isolates apps and processes to prevent one bad app from seizing control of your entire phone. The new model will have three broad segments: one for apps, one for the Android OS, and another for the vendor interface. The aptly named app section is self explanatory. The vendor interface is controlled by other actors who aren't users or Google — think device manufacturers, wireless carriers, and the like. Google controls the OS section, and the company will be able to push updates direcetly to this section without affecting the other two. The goal, Xin explained, is to provide better updates that are more broadly accepted. This may offset one of Android's perennial challenges: that device manufacturers and wireless carriers can prevent updates from being pushed from Google to user's devices. Treble will hopefully side-step this issue, but we'll have to see. Instant Apps and Security Keys Google announced Instant Apps at I/O 2016, and this year it opened up Instant Apps to all developers. In a nutshell, an Instant App allows you to use portions of an app without installing it. A store, for example, could develop an amazing shopping app, which could be accessed through the web as an Instant App. That way, the app is available to many more people, not just those who already installed it. Related After WannaCry, Should You Worry About Ransomware? After WannaCry, Should You Worry About Ransomware? Xin pointed out that while this is great, it had potential for abuse. "Opening arbitrary URLs in apps has associated privacy risks." To that end, Google is unveiling an updated permissions model that works to limit what Instant Apps can do, keeping many permissions away from these apps. Additionally, Instant Apps must use HTTPS, which will prevent lookalike apps from using URLs designed to trick consumers Android O will also add support for two-factor authentication security keys. These are physical devices that can be used instead of receiving a one-time passcode via SMS, as is a common means of employing 2FA protection. Physical keys, Ludwig explained, are faster for authenticating than other methods. Many of these changes, both in terms of visibility and the actual tools, mark a continued aggressiveness on the part of Google to secure the Android platform. The security features deployed by the company are increasingly robust and complex, and the protection Google provides is stronger and more visible than before. If anything can finally repel Android's security infamy, it may be this. Back to top Previous : Tim Cook's New Accessory: An Apple Glucose Monitor?

Here, Look at This Screen Scared of Driverless Cars? Here, Look at This Screen By Doug Newcomb May 19, 2017 10 Comments Waymo will show messages to 'help ease passengers' concerns' when they're no longer in control. If you live in the Phoenix area, you can now apply to join Waymo's "early rider program" and get chauffeured in one of the company's autonomous Chrysler Pacifica minivans in exchange for giving feedback on your experience. The project is designed to supply Waymo, the former Google self-driving car project that's now part of parent company Alphabet Inc., with info on "where people want to go in a self-driving car, how they communicate with our vehicles, and what information and controls they want to see inside," CEO John Krafcik wrote in a blog post. Waymo outfitted the exterior of the Chrysler Pacificas with an array of proprietary LiDAR and radar sensors that act as the eyes of its self-driving system. The sensors "are deeply integrated with the brain of our self-driving cars and specially designed software" so the vehicle is fully attuned to its surroundings, according to Google. Waymo also wants to make sure passengers are aware of what's going on around the vehicle and made several interior improvements to "help ease passengers' concerns," Waymo's technology chief Dmitri Dolgov told Bloomberg. The company gave Bloomberg a peek at a mockup of these interior upgrades, which include a dashboard display that shows other cars, pedestrians, and buildings around the vehicle "to give people confidence that the car is competent and in control." Some vehicles were "lit up if they were relevant to the situation," while "others were shown less prominently," Bloomberg reports. The idea is to show what a Waymo vehicle's sensors "see" and how the self-driving system closely monitors some cars more than others, the way a human driver would. The display also includes the outlines of buildings to help orient passengers to the world around them and flashes the message "waiting for intersection to clear" when the vehicle yields to traffic to make a turn at a traffic light. It can also inform occupants why the car is braking suddenly, such as for an animal in the road. In other words, now that self-driving technology is getting to a point where Google is inviting the public along for the ride, the next step is creating a user interface for people who are used to being in control of a car. Making the Experience Magical To help figure this out, Waymo cherry-picked user design experts who have worked on Google's Android operating system and Chrome browser, Bloomberg noted. It also recruited a "user experience" researcher who's tasked with making the experience in the company's self-driving vehicles "intuitive, accessible, fun—and even magical." Whether it's clueless drivers staring at their phones and drifting off course or some jerk aggressively cutting you off at high speeds, a close call in car is never fun or magical. And while I'm confident driverless cars will handle situations like this better than humans, how will humans handle it when they're not in command? Related Full Android to Arrive in Cars Within 2 Years Full Android to Arrive in Cars Within 2 Years It will take more than just a message on a dashboard screen to prepare and comfort passengers in autonomous cars. Perhaps Google UI experts should consider the work done by the late Stanford professor Clifford Nass, who conducted a study he called Car-Tharsis that explored ways in which a car can keep drivers from getting stressed out using voice prompts. The strategy used what Nass called cognitive reframing that "involves not letting the negative emotion start in the first place" he told me for a Wired article in 2008, way before the current self-driving car craze. "So rather than try to repair the emotion, you try to prevent it," he added. "Someone cuts you off and the car says, 'Five miles ahead, the road will clear,' something that changes your view from anger to something more positive." Or maybe the car could hurl insults at inconsiderate drivers. I admit that in my case that would probably help. What do you think self-driving cars should do to soothe savage commuters?

As Chicago’s downtown continues to heat up and spread its tendrils westward, the neighborhood has emerged as one of the Windy City’s most desirable area to live, dine, and innovate. Following a trend set by Google, companies such as McDonald’s, Glassdoor, and Dyson are preparing to make the move to the rapidly changing neighborhood. The West Loop has two hotels containing nearly 300 combined guest rooms currently under construction with a third, 170-room project currently preparing to break ground soon. Meanwhile the total number of apartment and condo units under consturction easily exceeds 1000. With many more waiting to break ground or gain city approval, the figure is expected to grow manifold. Here’s a quick look at eleven of the larger Fulton Market/West Loop projects under construction right now: ↑ One South Halsted At 44 stories, this cylindrical apartment tower is poised to make a major impact and extend Chicago’s skyline westward. Known as One South Halsted, the project from co-developers Fifield Companies and F&F Realty will rise nearly 500 feet and contain 492 rental units, 9,500 square feet of ground floor retail, and 375 parking stalls. The project replaces the lot of the adjacent Crown Plaza and will share its garage with its hotel neighbor. With foundation work wrapped up, the next step will be erecting the tower’s construction crane. More about this development >> ↑ 625 West Adams While technically east of the Kennedy Expressway in the so-called “West Loop Gate,’ the 20-story office tower at 625 W. Adams seems too large not to include. Replacing a surface parking lot owned by Old St. Patrick’s Church, the 432,000-square-foot building comes from architect Solomon Cordwell Buenz. It features a two-story lobby, ground floor retail, five levels of parking, and a rooftop terrace for tenants. Development partners White Oak Realty and CA Ventures are betting on continued West Loop office demand as they are building 625 W. Adams “on spec”—or without first securing an anchor tenant. More about this development >> ↑ McDonald’s HQ If Google’s choice to move to Chicago’s West Loop lit the fuse on the area’s real estate boom, the announcement that McDonald’s would relocate its corporate workforce to the neighborhood certainly turbocharged it. Currently rising at 110 N. Carpenter at the former location of Oprah’s Harpo Studios production company, the 600,000-square-foot future home of the global fast food giant comes from developer Sterling Bay and design architect Gensler. More about this development >> ↑ CA Aberdeen Located at 27 N. Aberdeen and just across the street from the future MickyD’s HQ, this 69-unit condo development is starting to come together. Known as CA Aberdeen, the sold-out project from Belgravia Group consists solely of 2,000-square-foot three-bedroom, three-bathroom residences starting around $800,000. Designed by Sullivan Goulette & Wilson, the building features 78 parking spaces on its lower level but forgoes any retail offerings. More about this development >> ↑ Landmark West Loop Towering over the Eisenhower express way at 1035 W. Van Buren, the 30-story apartment tower known as “Landmark West Loop” is racing towards a planned August opening. The 300-unit project features a textured, industrial-inspired facade and full suite of tenant amenities. Landmark is the first Chicago project from NY-based architect Morris Adjmi. More about this development >> ↑ Hoxton Hotel Morris Adjmi’s architectural firm is also behind the design of a Fulton Market hotel slated for the northwest corner of Lake and Green streets. The upcoming 11-story building will be occupied by the boutique London-based Hoxton Hotel and contain a rooftop terrace and around 170 guest rooms. Previously an auto shop and meat packing business, the site has been cleared and is awaiting construction permits. More about this development >> ↑ Ace Hotel Meanwhile, the Ace Hotel at 311 N. Morgan Street is preparing to welcome its first guests. The GREC-designed Bauhaus inspired building will feature 159 guest rooms, a rooftop bar, and 30 below grade parking stalls. The ground level retail spaces will contain a yet to be named restaurant concept and the Midwest’s first Stumptown Coffee Roasters location. More about this development >> ↑ Nobu Hotel Though one of the West Loop’s most anticipated developments, Chicago’s Nobu Hotel has taken a while to get going. With foundation work finally underway, it won’t be long before the 11-story building begins to go vertical. Designed by Modif Architecture, the finished hotel is expected to contain 119 guest rooms and a 10,000-square-foot Nobu restaurant from namesake star chef Nobu Matsuhisa.

Dubbed “Fulton West,” the nine-story office project will soon provide tenants such as Glassdoor and Dyson with 290,000 square feet of office space, private balconies, and yet another rooftop terrace.

Designed by Hartshorne Plunkard Architects, the masonry and glass building will feature 15,000 square feet of ground floor retail topped by two levels of parking, 40,000 square feet of office space, and 75 apartment units. MCZ recently unveiled plans for a 20-story apartment tower across the street at 166 N. Aberdeen.

Peoria was shorted and reprogrammed to instead feature 79 condos after facing criticism from nearby residents. The changes obviously weren’t enough to satisfy some neighbors who sued to block the project. The lawsuit has apparently done little to slow LG Development who broke ground on the building earlier this year.

A fresh perspective on SEO for B2B companies It's no longer about optimizing your website to rank for keywords. Columnist Garrett Mehrguth explains why B2B companies need to think differently about SEO. Garrett Mehrguth on May 19, 2017 at 10:38 am More There was a time when ranking No. 1 for a keyword was a victory wholly worth pursuing — a time when you could build a list of keywords, craft 300-word blog posts, and your site would drive new business. That is no longer the case. In 2017, we have a different search engine, and it’s critically important that B2B companies understand this. Search Engine Optimization (SEO) is no longer how you can optimize your site to rank for keywords; instead, SEO is about how you can optimize your company to be found by your target audience for different queries and on various sites throughout the search engine. This means that if you want to optimize your site for search engines, you need to be ever-present on paid search, organic results and digital placements. But why, you might ask? Well, let’s unpack this with statistics and a hypothetical situation. On average, B2B companies have a click-through rate (CTR) of 2.55 percent for search ads, according to HubSpot. And, in a study done by Advanced Web Ranking, it was found that the No. 1 organic position has a CTR of 29.87 percent. For the competitive marketer looking for their “next” opportunity, all of this data begs the question: “What about the other 67.58 percent?” The other 67.58 percent of the market is what you can capture when you change your perspective to optimizing for the entire page instead of just your own website. Thus, I would like to introduce… share of SERP: a way for B2B companies to take more market share around their most profitable keywords. Share of SERP starts with the careful analysis of the SERP for your most valuable keywords — you can start to understand what types of opportunities exist and what types of results Google is focusing on for that keyword. For example, the keywords with the highest buyer intent in B2B are often “best + keyword,” “top + keyword,” or even “keyword + reviews.” In fact, do that for one of your own keywords for this sample query: “best erp software for manufacturing.” Below, I’ve provided a screen shot of the SERP to illustrate the importance of digital placements. The only individual site that cracked the top six positions for this very valuable keyword is a blog post based around answering informational intent: “What Is The Best ERP For Manufacturing?” If your B2B SEO strategy is based around ranking your own website instead of positioning your brand, you’re missing the bigger picture. The reality is that your own website is no longer the best answer in Google’s mind for the keywords that are lowest in the funnel. Google favors independent websites that allow visitors to compare and review their options (you can thank Yelp for this). In fact, an Avanade study found that 61 percent of B2B buyers look to third-party review sites before approaching a business. Thus, to drive success (marketing-qualified leads or revenue) via your digital placements, it’s critical that you generate reviews. A study done by Clutch shows the value of the quantity of reviews and its correlation to profile views: “Each additional review added slightly less than 20 monthly views to a company’s profile.” Thus, if you want to not only increase your B2B company’s visibility, but also drive leads, you need to think about how you can take share of SERP by getting exceptional reviews on sites like Software Advice, G2 Crowd, Capterra and more. The harsh reality is that the line between an SEO’s role and a PPC strategist’s job is slowly blurring. It’s no longer enough to have SEO campaigns that don’t leverage data from your search terms report. And it’s no longer acceptable to have paid search specialists not looking at the entire search engine results page, managing PPC campaigns on channels like Capterra, or launching digital placements on sites within Google’s display network that rank in the top five for your most valuable keywords. You need a comprehensive approach to successfully capture the entire value that Google’s search engine results page has to offer. It’s time to rethink B2B SEO In conclusion, the entire point of SEO has never been to rank websites. It has been to drive revenue from a marketing channel that has no ongoing cost per acquisition. Most every other marketing channel since the beginning of time has forced you to continually pay for the leads it generates: Google search ads, social media ads (organic social is over), radio ads, television ads, print ads — all of these channels have an ongoing cost per acquisition. The channels that do not apply here are content marketing and public relations. Both these channels, however, form the foundation of B2B SEO. Thus, SEO is simply the digitized 2017 version of digital PR and content marketing. And, just as these both drive their value from audience exposure and placement, so must your SEO strategy. Caveat: Technical SEO and design/UX play a critical role in your SEO strategy as well, forming a tripod of SEO: content + links + technical/design. Hopefully, this piece has helped you recognize that the age of isolated on-site SEO for B2B companies is over. Understandably, if you still deem the role of SEO to be generating quality organic traffic, then you might be struggling with the above statement. But, as an SEO myself, I am not claiming that SEO is dead by any means. Simply that it’s time we start thinking about SEO differently. It’s time that we treat B2B SEO as the art (and science) of positioning a brand at every stage of the buyer journey, throughout the entirety of a search engine results page.

This year, the company is focusing on "making AI work for everyone," he said. Now in its final day, this year's event has highlighted Google's increasing use of AI and machine learning for everything from email to job-hunting to healthcare. The company's latest initiatives even include one that uses machine learning to design better machine learning. During the event, Google also unveiled the second generation of its tensor processing units (TPUs), chips custom-designed for machine learning. The new cloud TPUs will be made available to developers and researchers via Google's Compute Engine, with an alpha program for users set to kick off sometime in the future. Immersive Computing for Everyone Google also continues to work on advancing its capabilities in augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR), and investing in platforms that will make them more accessible to a wider audience, according to VR/AR vice president Clay Bavor. "In order for immersive computing to be 'for everyone,' developers need to build great apps and experiences," Bavor wrote yesterday in a blog post. "We're working on tools and tech to help them do that." A new tool called Instant Preview, for example, is designed to let developers using VR headsets see the results of programming changes they make "in seconds, not minutes," Bavor said. Another tool coming soon, Seurat, is aimed at helping mobile developers achieve high-fidelity, real-time scenes and graphics that are equal to or better than those on desktops, he said. And this summer, Google will launch Chrome VR, which will enable users of the mobile VR platform Daydream to browse the Web in virtual reality. The tech giant also released an experimental build of its open-source Chromium browser with an API for augmented reality. Smarter, Faster Gmail Replies More commonly used Google apps are also becoming increasingly smart. For instance, the company announced Wednesday that its Smart Reply feature for Gmail will begin rolling out over the next two weeks for Android and iOS mobile devices. It will be available first in English, with Spanish rolling out in the coming weeks and more languages to follow. Smart Reply offers three response suggestions based on the content of an individual email message. A user can either tap one of the options to send it immediately, or select a response to edit it before sending. "Smart Reply utilizes machine learning to give you better responses the more you use it," Gmail software engineer Greg Bullock wrote on the G Suite blog. "So if you're more of a 'thanks!' than a 'thanks.' person, we'll suggest the response that's, well, more you!" Over the coming weeks, Google also plans to launch a new Google for Jobs feature that will incorporate AI into its Search function to make it easier for employers and job seekers to make better-focused matches. During today's final day of Google I/O, the schedule includes sessions on how to push the boundaries of machine learning, how to apply "built-in hacks of conversation" to voice-based user interfaces, and how to use behavioral insights to boost user retention. The 2017 Google I/O developer conference -- or festival, as the company likes to call it -- has been running May 17 - 19, at the Shoreline Amphitheatre in Mountain View, California.

Meanwhile, the search giant’s dedicated digital wallet platform continued its relatively slow global expansion, previewing a major partnership with old-school e-payment service PayPal, and carefully cooking up the next wave of around-the-world launches, as announced at I/O 2017. Also at the still-ongoing annual developer conference moved from San Francisco to Mountain View last year, we found out about another very cool trick headed to the Google Assistant “in the upcoming months.” We’re talking legit peer-to-peer payments controlled by voice, and the whole process is exactly as awesomely convenient and futuristic as it sounds. At least on paper, it looks like all you’ll need to do is summon your virtual assistant, say something along the lines of “send $10 to Jane for pizza” or whatever, and then confirm the “transaction” with your fingerprint on supported Android smartphones. The feature should also work on the substantially upgraded Google Home, and it’s only contingent on linking a debit card to a valid Google account, which is something you’ve probably already done for Play Store purchases. Another important related announcement, this one focusing on app developers for the time being, is that of the Google Payment API, letting people “pay in app or online with any verified credit or debit card saved to their Google Account”… sometime soon. No Android Pay installation needed for users, and no trying to remember and type “multiple lines of payment details”. Just a security code, and you’re all set. Now that’s the future of payments.

If you’re fortunate enough to have a sprinkler system, new lawn care technology can help keep your lawn green while saving cash. Let’s take a look at smart sprinkler controllers and see if they are the right solution for you. What Is a Sprinkler Controller? If you have any type of irrigation system at home, you’re probably familiar with sprinkler controllers. They come in all shapes and sizes, and are often located in a garage or another out-of-the-way location. All the electrical wires from the different parts of the system converge at the controller. You can set watering programs to determine when your sprinklers are on, and how long each zone is active. Most controllers look like an old-school VCR with a host of buttons, dials, and a calculator-like screen. That’s not exactly what I’d call well-designed or easy to use for anyone used to a smartphone or tablet. Because of the design, some homeowners don’t know how to fine tune their system when needed or how to easily change the watering schedule because of changing seasons or different weather conditions. Image Credit: topseller via Shutterstock Both over-watering or under-watering a lawn can cause problems. Without enough water, a lawn can easily dry up and die, leaving a big yellow patch of dirt in your yard — not exactly a big help to your property value. On the other hand, too much water on a lawn makes it the perfect place for weeds, bugs, and fungus to proliferate. And in some parts of the country, overwatering can cause foundation issues that can cost thousands of dollars to repair. Because of water shortages, there are also watering restrictions in many locations that only allow homeowners to irrigate on certain days and times of the week. There are a lot of benefits to having total control over your lawn, but for most people the typical technology isn’t an ideal solution. Rounding Up a Rachio Given this, it might come as no surprise that smart home technology has made a move to the humble device.

Even though the market is still young, one of the best smart sprinkler controllers is from Rachio. There are two models of the second-generation device. An eight-zone controller is $199 while a controller for up to 16 different zones is $249. The best way to determine which model you’ll need is to take a look at your current controller and number of zones.

Buy Now At Amazon $189.90 The Biggest Obstacle: A Wi-Fi Connection Once you’ve determined which model to install, it’s time to tackle the most significant installation issue: receiving a strong and fast Wi-Fi signal at the controller’s location. In most cases, a controller can be found at the the edge of a home, like in a garage or elsewhere. That is usually not a location that you’ve previously been using a wireless device for a long period of time.

Read More . Installation After you are confident in the Wi-Fi signal at the controller, it’s time for installation. You’ll at minimum need a Phillps head screwdriver and maybe a drill and hammer for installation on drywall. Before removing the old controller, it’s very important to take a picture of the existing wiring from a few angles. This will act as a reference when installing the Rachio. After removing the old controller from the wall, you’ll replace it with the Rachio using the four included anchors and screws. You’ll need to place the host of wires into the same location they were with the old controller. That’s where the photo of the old setup will come in handy. For me, the entire installation process took less than 30 minutes. You can have a professional install the controller if necessary (this is specifically recommended if the Rachio is outdoors). However, anyone with basic home improvement knowledge should be able to get the job done without issue. Setup and Use Once the controller is ready to go, use the Android app or iOS app to finish the installation process. The first major task is to identify and set up each zone. You can customize a name for each zone and then optionally answer a number of questions about the zone. You’ll tell the app what exactly is growing in the zone (e.g. cool seasonal grass or annual plants) the type of soil, how much sun the zone receives, the slope, and the sprinkler nozzle type. If you moonlight as a soil scientist, there are even more settings to tweak in the Advanced section. Especially if you have a large yard, that process could take some time, but it is vitally important for the system to properly irrigate the yard with the minimum amount of water. Once that’s complete, it’s time to create a watering schedule. There are a few options to select. Picking to water on a fixed interval or fixed days won’t save as much water, but does allow more predictability to watering. If water savings is a top priority, there are two types of different flexible schedules: daily and monthly versions. The flexible monthly options adjust every month based on local climate while the daily option will adjust based on the determined soil moisture. Making Sense of Weather Speaking of climate, another important feature you’ll need to customize using the app is selecting a weather station. The Rachio will use the weather information as part of its Weather Intelligence feature. Using a rain and freeze sensor, non-connected controllers will not water if rain or cold conditions are detected at the watering time. The Rachio takes this functionality one step further by actually examining upcoming forecasts to determine if your lawn needs water. For example, with the Rain Skip feature, if my Rachio forecasts a certain amount of rain in the next 24 hours, it will not activate. Similar features will activate when a freeze is detected and if the ground is determined to have enough moisture. The Seasonal Shift will also adjust water times each month based on your local climate. With all four features active, you can truly set the Rachio up and not have to worry about watering the lawn again. And so far this year, according to the app, I’ve personally saved nearly 30,000 gallons of water. Eventually, the controller will pay for itself from lower water bills. A True Smart Home Device Since the Rachio is a smart home device, it plays nicely with a whole host of products including with the Amazon Echo lineup 7 Creative Uses for Amazon Echo and Alexa 7 Creative Uses for Amazon Echo and Alexa You’ve seen the ads starring Alec Baldwin, but you're still not sure what Amazon Echo does or whether you need one in your home.

If the Nest Protect detects smoke, the Rachio will cycle through each zone to help make the ground around your home moist. That could help any fire from spreading to adjoining property. My only issue with Rachio is a small one. There’s no type of screen of any kind on the controller. You can manually run watering cycles from the controller, but there’s no other information to view. I enjoy using the app, and my controller is usually stuck behind a parked car. But for some users, this limitation could be an issue. However, there are other controllers on the market, including the similar RainMaster that do feature a screen.

CEO Sundar Pichai brings the thunder at Google I/O 2017. Image: AP/REX/Shutterstock By Karissa Bell2017-05-19 15:18:13 UTC Trust me, I never thought it would come to this. If you had asked me a week ago what I was expecting from Google's I/O developer conference, "boring" is not the word that would've come to mind. Yet, looking at this year's announcements, I'm struck most by how completely expected and, well, safe it all is. Sure, Google Lens was far and away the best thing Google previewed here, and a standalone VR headset is particularly enticing if you're a VR enthusiast (so far a pretty small, self-selecting group). SEE ALSO: Google's Assistant app for iOS is a clunky mess But none of that is exciting or especially innovative. Google Lens is just a rehashed version of Google Goggles (albeit slightly more useful), and we've been hearing rumors about Google's standalone VR headset for well over a year. Boring, right? Most boring @google #io17 ever — Ilia 🕶 Daraselia (@idaraselia) May 17, 2017 All this #politics stuff is crowding out Google #IO17. Google is kind of a boring company these days, at least to me. Been there, done that. — Jake Hamby (@jhamby) May 18, 2017 Suddenly #io17 has become an infomercial of Google home. A beta product only available in US. #boring — Imanol Pérez Iriarte (@ipereziriarte) May 17, 2017 Right. That wasn't always the case. It wasn't that long ago when Sergey Brin enlisted a group of skydivers to introduce the world to Google Glass. Or when Google's Advanced Technology and Projects (ATAP) division, the skunkworks behind moonshot ideas like modular smartphones, gesture-sensing radar, and clothing with embedded sensors, was a reliable source of shock and awe for I/O attendees. This year, though, there was no sign of ATAP, which lost its chief visionary Regina Dugan to Facebook last year.  It's not just ATAP, either. There was no sign of anything remotely experimental. Instead, we got to see the most polished version of Google's augmented reality tech yet (which, by the way, started in ATAP nearly four years ago), new skills for Google's digital assistant, VR features we don't really need, and yet another fine, but also boring, update for Android. Lost in all the announcements is the part of Google that used to be daring. Don't get me wrong: None of these things are, in themselves, bad. Tango technology stands to be a truly valuable learning tool, Google's Assistant is starting to look like it could finally fulfill the wasted potential of Google Now, and Android O appears to be a solid, if unremarkable, update. Great.  The fact is, Google needs these services to be reliable and good and that's exactly what it's trying to deliver. But lost in all that is the part of Google that used to be daring — the Google that was unafraid to take risks, "do epic shit," and show off crazy ideas that might never end up working outside of Google's research labs.  You could argue that Google has outgrown its moonshots. Google X, Alphabet's moonshot factory, has reportedly been reorganized amid a broader cost-savings effort. After all, the company doesn't make billions of dollars a year because it partnered with Levi's to make an app-enabled jacket or because it cracked the code on positional tracking in virtual reality.  But it's exactly projects like these — the wild, futuristic, epic shit — that makes Google... well, Google.  Google Glass was an abject failure and, yet, here we are a few years later and seemingly every major tech company is salivating over augmented reality. Alphabet's self-driving car arm, Waymo, is reportedly a mess, but would autonomous-car technology be where it's at now if every car and tech company in the world wasn't racing to keep up with Google in the first place? Project Ara's modular smartphones are dead (and, if we're being honest, were never remotely realistic in the first place) but in an era when all our smartphones are near-identical slabs of glass and metal, it was the last truly innovative imagining of what a smartphone could be. All of these things will have a noticeable and lasting impact, even if it's not immediately obvious. And it was all possible because of a culture that encouraged its employees to move fast and take risks. Maybe that hasn't changed still, but you wouldn't know it from walking around the company's biggest event of the year.  You'd be bored, just like me.

Funny video: 8 accents are tested on Google Home, Alexa, and Siri with 4 different questions Rita El Khoury Follow View All Posts 2017/05/18 4:58am PDTMay 18, 2017 44 Plus 1 on G+ 345 Share on Facebook 87 Share on Twitter Total Shares476 Google News Videos   Google's speech recognition error rate is getting lower and lower - yesterday, the company said it's now under 5% and has dropped from 8.5% this time last year. And I find that to be more and more the case in my own use: Google seems to recognize almost everything I throw at it now, even when I add Lebanese/Arabic names from my contacts list that I wouldn't expect it to get right. But if you're wondering how Google's speech recognition fares in comparison to other voice assistants, Wired has made a video in conjunction with Andy Wood and Matt Kirshen (from Probably Science) to show you just that. They tested 4 different questions with some difficult to spell words like Ouagadougou and Benedict Cumberbatch and they did the test on Siri, Alexa on an Echo, and Google Home (no Cortana though), with 8 different accents. It's a funny video so don't expect anything scientific or any serious data to come out of it, and don't expect accuracy... at all. Some of the accents were stereotypical and not even remotely correct (the Italian one is nothing like what I hear from my Italian friends) and the people were urged to go as crazy as possible with their pronunciation. Still, it's amazing to see how many questions were correctly answered by all 3 systems, and especially how well Google Assistant fared with the most ridiculous enunciations. Watch and laugh. (You can also cringe at some accents, that's OK.)

I think your error is that you missed just that word. :) Rita El Khoury Hah. Fixed. rpitera Plot twist: She was using Google to dictate the article!! Da da DUNNNNNNN! Hadi Satrio When it comes to machine learning, the more data you have to train the algorithm, the better. Considering the amount of data Google has compared to those 2 companies, it's hardly a surprise the Assistant ran circles around Siri and Alexa. Christopher Bement Do you have a quantification of the data that Amazon and Apple collect in comparison? I imagine it's obvious google has more and better ways of collecting, but I figure Apple has to be at least in the ballpark. Maybe Siri is just bad. I've always had a better time using the Google app to get shit done, even before assistant. Siri is hit or miss. Also, I've never had a situation where I needed to know which flights were above me. But I did need someone to beatbox for me, and Assistant came through. UtopiaNH Google Voice. It gave them an enormous heads up on international calls very early on in the game. Christopher Bement Whoa, now you have my attention. I had no idea they were mining data from that. I don't mind as I don't use it that much and it's usually work related anyway. Kinda cool actually. JasonIvers How did you think they did the transcription of your voicemails? Christopher Bement Well that makes sense, I just never thought about it or read too much into it. Donny Stanley Something to be aware of about Google: if they introduce a new product or feature that you find useful, odds are its primary goal is data collection for machine learning. needa I don't think it's and odds game. Nobody does anything nowadays without collecting data. Data is the most valuable commodity right now. tlingitsoldier They actually started even before Google Voice. They started with Goog-411. Any phone, smart or otherwise, could call in for a free 411 service. It wasn't great, but it still worked. That was them getting their feet wet collecting voice data. saf1927 The comment section under that video is a shitfest, then again it's YouTube. Tr3ple I didn't know Italians were so racist, fuck em now. Iwanova If you follow Serie A since 90's. You won't be surprised. matteventu Italian living in the UK here. I have my Pixel XL set in English, of course, and I very often use Google Keyboard with voice dictation. I almost never get any mistake, whatever I say. But one thing that I still haven't managed to set up in a decent way is the "Ok Google" hotword to unlock the device. I set the language in Italian, I train it, and it works flawlessly from even the next room. I set it in English, I train it (just the training makes me repeat it 6 times instead of 3), and then it goddamn never works when the Pixel is locked. Come on Google. It can't be my Italian accent. Phoenix Google è pazzo ! matteventu Oh man. Vaffanculo Google!!! Phoenix Assistant : Sorry, I can't do that yet. M. Luciano Both Pixel and Home have no problem with my accent most of the time. Also use voice dictation on Gboard a lot and that goes very well. whispy_snippet Yep, this drives me insane. It's broken. Maxr1998 Wow, it's exactly the same for me in German. Maybe it's because the hotword is analysed differently (on-device)? ChicagoPete I think you're right, the hotword detection has to be based on tone/cadence or else the phone would be constantly translating what it hears while it's supposed to be asleep. Powsniffer0110 Does only the pixel work when locked? Cause mine doesn't. Do you mean locked and not screen off or locked and screen off matteventu I mean fully locked, pin and screen off. If it's unlocked, it seems it recognises more easily my accent/pronunciation. Leighton Compton I have the same problem. but using english only. There is a bug that stops it from unlocking the device. Hopefully its fixed soon. anoying!! Willie Chalmers III Doesn't Google's recent announcement about Assistant being able to recognize newer languages make this slightly irrelevant/outdated? Hadi Satrio Language != accent, I think. Theoritically Assistant/Siri/Alexa could be good at recognizing Japanese but not English with a Japanese accent. Willie Chalmers III Makes sense. msw Italian... REALLY? This is soooo wrong (and I'm German, btw) ilovetesla when is gonna bless us with custom hotword support??? CD RW meh they didn't test the ultimate hardcore mode : french accent jibust I agree, we need Jean Girard to test this out. https://cdn-0.motorsport.com/static/img/mgl/200000/290000/291000/291800/291890/s8/nascar-cup-talladega-ii-2005-filming-of-the-movie-high-wide-and-handsome-drivers-introduct.jpg Iwanova And Arsene Wenger too. ninjustin I don't even think I could say that properly. I'd never expect a voice recognition software to understand me. Alejandro British accent? What is that? I though there were like 10 accents in England... DonEmu When they say British accent, they usually mean London. Alejandro There are at least 3 'official' accents in London. Adam Margeson Generally, the accepted one is what someone from the West Coast and midwest would sound like. The South has a drawl and the East Coast is a big mess of lots of different accents that can vary from one neighborhood to the next. Disclaimer: I'm from the West Coast and haven't travelled the country for any extended periods of time. T.J. There are multiple "American" accents depending on where in the country you are as well, just like every country. Cakefish The video makes no sense as Scottish and British can never be mutually exclusive terms (unless Scotland gets independence from the UK). Iamsecond Only 10? Depending on which source you check there are around 56 main accents in the UK, but each of those also have multiple variations. It is certainly true that there is no generic 'British' accent however (unless you count the relatively artificial 'received pronunciation,') so your point stands. Cakefish This is confusing and plain wrong. Scottish people are simultaneously Scottish and British. British is a term used to describe everyone in the UK (so Northern Ireland too) as well as British dependant territories (Isle of Man, Channel Islands, Gibraltar, Faulkland Islands etc.). It's so called because the island of Britain forms the largest part of the UK by land area as well as population. Thus, you cannot use Scottish and British as mutually exclusive terms in the way this video has. It's akin to listing American and Texan as independent nationalities. TheScientists Are you Scottish? Having been to Scotland, I think had I asked anyone there whether it was OK to call them British, I would have been shown the door. Cakefish I can guarantee that they'd rather be called British than English. Nothing angers the Scottish more than ignorant Americans calling the UK 'England'. You'd think that Americans could easily grasp the concept of a union of nation states (being from the 'United States') but many simply cannot. It overloads their brains, it goes far beyond their comprehension. Not all Americans of course, majority are intelligent and have no trouble understanding this. I love Americans, just to be clear. But just because the Scottish don't like the term doesn't mean that it's not true. You can be Scottish first, British second - that's no issue. Fact is though, if they are a citizen of the UK they are British. Same way that you're​ still biologically a human even if you don't identify as one. You cannot escape facts. As much as many Scots love to pretend that they are already a fully independent nation they currently are not. Please note that I fully support their right to choose independence. Until then British is the only term that can correctly describe every citizen of the UK, nomatter where they live. Obviously the polite thing to do is call them Scottish because they are Scottish and they prefer being called that to being called British, as you correctly state. Ailín Ó’S Only England, Scotland and Wales are countries. The territory in the North of Ireland is a province. Cakefish Same difference. It is a country. It has equal status within the union. It is no more or less important than the other nations of the UK. Whatever you call it, it is equal to England, Scotland and Wales. Province, country and nation all mean the same thing when taking about the constituent members of the UK. RMAN! Hey Google - Whatsa matta wit you? Total Insecurity Apparently, many people ask for Benedick Cumberlatch's birthday. Miku is Best Vocaloid Assistant already got used to my Mexican accent, I haven't tried Siri or Alexa all that much, I think Siri is already in Spanish so there would be no point in my trying it out. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Damn, and here I was planning to develop an Irish accent. Ailín Ó’S That's an English accent, not "British", there is no such thing as a "British" accent because Britain is not a country. England, however, is. As is Scotland and Wales. Bizarrely they list Scottish as a separate accent but not English! Anna Bobanna "South" is not a country either, but there's a such thing as a southern accent. Accents come from regions, not countries. Ailín Ó’S No, "Southern" is not an accent. Southern where? Southern American, Southern Australian etc, is. Anna Bobanna Google "southern accent" and see what everybody agrees it means. You're just reaching now. Ailín Ó’S No, I'm not. You realise there are other countries aside from USA right? "Southern" is subjective, for me that means Ireland, for someone else it could be Greece etc. Whereas "Southern American" is, well, Southern American! People would know exactly what you mean then. Anna Bobanna Ok then, Is Boston a country? Because there's a such thing as a Boston accent. How about Arabic? Is Arabia a country? How about East Europe? Because, again, there's something knows as an eastern European accent. Because, again, accents come from regions. Ailín Ó’S Certainly there is a Boston accent but that in itself is still an American accent. The point was why did the makers of this video differentiate Scottish as an accent but not English. Cakefish And Welsh matteventu We were talking about English/British accent, southern where? Guess it. matteventu Stop talking shit. There is the English accent, the British accent, the southern British accent, and the Brighton accent. It's not mathematics. There's a line on the ground that tells you where an accent begins and ends. Atmey Now do Arabic dialects. JD Siri is awful with "Canadian" too. 10/10 if I say something like 100 Main St in Toronto it says do you mean 100 Main St Orlando? Navigating! It only works if I butcher the pronunciation of Toronto to something like "Toe, Ron, Toe" Goddamn it Siri you POS. Adam Margeson https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/rental_car.png quixada The irony is that Ouagadougou is spelled wrong in this article... :-P "They tested 4 different questions with some difficult to spell words like Ougadougou..." Rita El Khoury You saw nothing :p Gay Hermit British? I want to see this test done with the Geordie accent. JG Not to be "that guy"... You did point out these are stereotypical and sound nothing like locals. But just to put it out there, there isn't a "British" accent. There are several regional accents (56 primary types according to Qura). Scouse, from Liverpool area, sounds nothing, and is potentially unintelligible to a London based Cockney accent. German is regionalized as well. Natives are often able to determine where someone loves within a few miles based on accent. AJKahn When was Bandit Cucumberpatch born? Si vis pacem, para bellum I am Italian so I guess I have an Italian accent, Google works great whether I speak to it in Italian or English (I have English enabled as my secondary language). I asked it the question in the article and it understood me the first time... Siri is utter crap whenever I try it on friends' iOS toys.

How Google plans to tackle power consumption even more aggressively in Android Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/05/18 5:29pm PDTMay 18, 2017 13 Plus 1 on G+ 93 Share on Facebook 55 Share on Twitter Total Shares161 Android OS Development Google News Videos Yesterday at I/O Google had an interesting talk called Background Check and Other Insights into the Android Operating System Framework. It's a long name, but really it's about improving battery life in Android. It went on at great length as to how, exactly, they plan on doing that, and it's quite worth a watch. We have the video here, but if you don't have the half-hour to check it out, then you are welcome to read below. The central methodology Google is using to try to improve things is the idea of visibility. When something is running in the background and doing a ton of stuff like calling your location at quick intervals, it results in battery drain. So now Google wants to change how things happen in the background, by ensuring that free-running background services aren't sucking your battery dry. Background apps will be pushed out of memory when they leave the foreground, and requests for things like location or WiFi happening in the background will only occasionally see new information from Android. Applications that would otherwise receive broadcasts also might not wake up unless they are given an explicit call to do so in the broadcast, although there are some exceptions. Apps can still get around this by being foregrounded in some way, but now that will be something visible that the user is aware of. This focus on visibility for apps will also mean developers will have to make decisions about what is really better to the user. If doing an ongoing notification as a means of bypassing the stuff above would confuse a user, is that really the right thing for them to do in that case? Other tools can be used to schedule your tasks ahead of time or to wait for events like the job intent service that developers can use in both pre and post-O environments. Jobs and alarms also allow the OS to defer. So, if something happens that would trigger a bunch of other apps to wake up, like a new picture being taken, that can be passed to those apps one at a time after a delay. That way the user doesn't suddenly have a ton of performance issues and drain out of nowhere. Basically, Google wants to solve some of the problems with battery life by defining bad behaviors for developers, like persistent background services or accidental leaks to the background of typically foregrounded activities, and make it clear that things have to be done the right way going forward or their stuff won't work. But it's also giving them new tools and choices for how to best accomplish the things they need to do. The new features in the Play Console and in Android Studio should also help developers be aware of when they are making these mistakes so that they can be fixed. It's a matter of visibility for the developers as well as visibility for the users. To paraphrase Steve Balmer: Visibility, visibility, visibility. A significant user-facing change of this visibility mindset is a new battery menu in O, with a focus on actionable interaction. Instead of just seeing stuff like Screen and Google Play Services next to a number that they won't understand, now users will be given ways of interacting with that data if they don't like it, and can better see how they are using applications without needing to do a bunch of mental calculations. So, when a user has a problem with their expectations of battery performance and goes looking to see what might be causing it, they are more likely to find what caused it, understand what it means, and take action about it. All of these changes are is in pursuit of Google's holy grail: multi-day battery life. Right now the tools in software aren't all there, but these are steps that can take us in that direction.

Good feature to take from iOS Knowledgeborn Allah This does seem similar to what Apple implemented in iOS, but I'm curious about how this will impact RAM management. If it reduces the cache file too much, it'll just close the application completely, and you'll have to start over every time you want to use the app again. Apple somehow found a way around this problem, even in devices with less RAM, but I'm not too sure how Google will accomplish this. Even "doze" on my Pixel XL kills apps in the background all the time. This new thing sounds it could potentially make the problem worse. Justin Osborne Well I sure can tell a difference since upgrading, that's for sure. The new battery section makes me feel a lot better about how the battery is looking. But that's where it ends. Today, I got a full hour less out of my battery than normal. 2 hours vs 3-3.5 on the Pixel. That said, it's a beta, so I'm not complaining. It's definitely not the direction I want to go tho (nor are these new emoticons, sigh). marcusmarcus2 "Google's holy grail: multi-day battery life." I'm glad, but can we get a two pronged attack to address this. Yes, Google needs to keep improving the software side, but OEMs need to help out and quit making thinner phones. They are thin enough, give us more battery capacity. AbdulB1 actually they save quite a lot by putting small batteries in the phones instead of big ones. Krzysztof Jozwik I'm not sure you read OP's comment. Nothing was said about saving... AbdulB1 smaller capacity battery is much cheaper marcusmarcus2 My original comment was not about savings, cheapness, cost, etc. Jack Jennings You've said the same thing twice for no reason. Krzysztof Jozwik I wouldn't say "much" I'm no expert on the matter, but last I checked replacement batteries aren't that expensive, and I don't have the buying power of an oem AbdulB1 Most phones today dont have replacement batteries, they have unremovable ones. OEM or no OEM a 3000mAh battery will always be cheaper than 4000mAh one. marcusmarcus2 I can find batteries for my different Moto G phones that have "Non-User replaceable batteries" for nearly the same price as my LG phones that have user replaceable batteries online. Most likely the OEMs can get them for about the same as well so replaceable or not really does not matter. Either way, yes a 3000mAh battery will be cheaper than a 4000mAh one for OEMs, but probably not much at all, especially at the volume they would by at. I'm guessing they are choosing smaller batteries to make their phones thinner and not because it is slightly cheaper for them. Thinness is better to advertise to most consumers as most consumers are drawn to looks over functionality now a days. I still prefer function over looks for my devices. Krzysztof Jozwik And non replaceable will always be cheaper than replaceable. The point is, the batteries aren't the bulk of the cost. Geoff Johnson What the hell is your point? He never said anything about cost, he was just talking about stop making phones thinner for design and aesthetic reasons. james fuston The idea that smaller and thinner phones result in less battery life is a bit of a misnomer. For an example, I'd refer you to the iPhone SE. marcusmarcus2 I never said smaller and thinner. I just said thinner. They could make some of the phones the same height and width as the current one but make it a little thicker to give a thicker battery, and that would help with the battery life. james fuston Okay, but your general sentiment is still that battery life is tied directly to physical size which, again stating my example of the iPhone SE, isn't the case. The power draw of the components is far more important than the physical size of the phone. marcusmarcus2 My general sentiment is ONLY in regards to thickness of the phone. My sentiment is not to width or height, which also make up the size of the phone. The width and height is usually determined more by the screen where thickness is more often do to battery. A larger screen (component) will draw more power than a smaller screen, I agree with you there. But you seem to think the size of the battery does not make a difference, please correct me if I am wrong. Using your example of iPhone SE, if they would have made that a little thicker than it is now by making the battery larger, that would have made the battery life even longer than it already is. That is my point. james fuston > A larger screen (component) will draw more power than a smaller screen, I agree with you there. Let me give this one more shot. "your general sentiment is still that battery life is tied directly to physical size which, again stating my example of the iPhone SE, isn't the case" To break out the pieces, battery life is tied...to physical size...which, again...isn't the case. In other words, we do not agree. The iPhone SE is the exact same size as the iPhone 5S and it gets 30%+ better battery life purely through efficiency in components. To say high mAh results in long battery life is a misnomer that the G6 or V20 should be a clear reminder of. You also cannot equate physical size to battery capacity as energy density is not a universal measurement. marcusmarcus2 You are comparing different phones with different components. I agree with you that component efficiency has an effect on battery life. But... Let me give you one more shot. We will use your iPhone SE for this. If there were 2 versions of the SE. Both have the exact same components except one has a battery that is 1000 mAh larger than the other (thus making it slightly thicker), than the one with the larger battery would have more battery life, Thus the thicker one would have better battery life. That is what I am saying. I'm not comparing large phones to small phones. I'm saying if they had a larger battery in a phone with the exact same specs/components then the battery life would be better. That is all my point was. Do you not agree with that? EDIT: Yes, size of the battery may not increase with capacity due to density, but it usually will increase in size as it does increase in capacity, especially if it increases a lot. Geoff Johnson Again, you're talking about it being smaller. The iPhone SE gets good battery life because it has a 4" screen. The complaint is that phones are getting THINNER. Meaning that they still have 5.5-6" displays, but are thinner and translate to smaller batteries. james fuston Nope, not at all. The cell in the SE is about 50mAh bigger than the 5S (which is the exact same size). The 30%+ battery life improvement comes from more efficient components, not just their size. marcusmarcus2 Technically it is 2 dimensional train of thought. Also, if they increased it horizontally or vertically, then they would most likely have to increase the dimensions of the phone horizontally or vertically, thus changing the size of the screen or bezel. Increasing it thickness wise means they would not have to change the look of the of the front of the phone. Anywho, I'm only talking about thickness, not height, width, different components, different phones, not small phones or big phones. I'm talking just battery capacity, if all other components remain the same. Thickening the battery would add battery capacity without changing the over all look much at all. It could be any phone of your choosing. If adding a thicker/higher capacity battery to whatever 1 phone you want, that phone would have a longer battery life. Do you not agree with that logic? JD The SE wasn't thinner. Ryne Hager Give me a OnePlus with 5000mAh and I would be so happy. someone755 Give me a 4.7" phone like the og Moto X and I would be so happy. Neither of us are going to be happy, Ryne. Drakenoid OG Moto X updated for current year would be perfect for me. Kristian Ivanov I highly agree on the thin phones part. Bought a Huawei P10 2 days ago, for me, that thing is unusable without a case to make it a bit fatter. Karly Johnston If they fix idle battery drain that doesn't become an issue. marcusmarcus2 I'm not saying they should not fix battery drain. I'm saying if they fix battery drain AND add higher capacity battery (making phone a little thicker), they could increase battery life even more than just addressing one of them. So if fixing the battery drain adds another day and a thicker battery adds another day, you'd go from 1 day to 3 days instead of just 2 days from only fixing battery drain. Karly Johnston The battery life the current 625 phones are getting is where flagships need to be. That should be enough for anyone. marcusmarcus2 Everyone is not all the same. It may be enough for you. I'm saying, phones are beyond thin enough and could be thicker to increase battery life even more beyond what a 625 phone can do. Now, this is my opinion in regards to how I would like to use a phone. You are welcome to your own opinion. I'm not going to say what should be enough for anyone other than me. Karly Johnston The OEMs don't think that is what the vast majority of people need or want. Their target is a full day of battery life which is what most people are worried about. It isn't my opinion, it is the industry opinion of what the marketing priorities are. X-47B My phone has 4000 mAh battery, and it's 5.5-inch display. I easily get 2 days of battery even after heavy usage. Margaritas Ante Porcos Installed O on my 6p and battery still drains like a whore in a bukkake twelvesome. Google really can't do nothing at this point. Android is breaking to pieces. So many things needed to be fixed in O but instead Android's got even worse. That notification empty desert area of white grey nothingness kills me the most. Hate it really bad. The last Android I liked was 6th. catalysto Not sure what you're talking about. Battery life on my 6P with the new O is great. Maybe you have an aging battery? Margaritas Ante Porcos as long as your 6p works great, nothing else matters, right? Roy That's right. catalysto Just saying. My anecdotal evidence is as good as yours. And having poor battery life across multiple OS versions is a pretty strong indicator for a bad battery, don't ya think? In fact, I had the same problem with a previous 6P. iFeign Complain some more about your beta software Margaritas Ante Porcos It started with 7.1.2. Do you really need to be a btch when bad things happen to others? Roy For me everything goes smooth on my 6P on 7.1.2. so I need to complain that Android to good. The Wrath of Kahn If your 6P has shut down even once before reaching about 5% then you most likely have one of the defective batteries. I had to have mine replaced, but after that, it runs all day like a charm. ODP2 improved it, if anything. Margaritas Ante Porcos it was fine for a long time until I updated to 7.1.2. That update screwed the battery that was working superb all the time. DANA Try to do a factory reset, it fixes many problem for some user. Margaritas Ante Porcos It was one of the first things I did. Twice. Did not help. Paul_Werner Yeah you got to call Google (if you got yours from the Play Store). They've been replacing 6Ps with factory refurbished ones even out of warranty (source: it happened to me) Matthew Skalecki The update didn't screw up your battery. The battery was going to crap out on you regardless of which Android version you had. This happened to many people including me. Replacing the battery fixes the issue; reverting to a previous os does nothing. Zach Mauch Did you go through Google or a local shop? The Wrath of Kahn Unfortunately it was out of warranty, had a friend with the skills do it for me. JD I need more of this colorful imagery to describe simple everyday problems. mchalakov First off you are using a beta OS don't complain. Second thing is that battery drain comes mostly from the (bad)apps - if you watched the video or read the article you could understand. Third - I'm pretty sure you can go back to Marshmallow if you are so so so unhappy with Nougat or O. Jakst Really? Yesterday was my first day with Android O. I plugged my phone out at 7, and come home at midnight with 35 % battery left. I've never had that kind of battery life in my 6P before. So I've seen huge gains with this O preview. thereasoner The Android O beta I'm using is so slow to charge my Pixel today that it seems like that's what they tackled​....and not in a good way. iFeign Surprise, surprise, you're running BETA software. Smh. thereasoner Yeah I know and I'm sure it will get fixed between now and September. I'm just saying that the current difference in charge time is quite noticable at this point. AbdulB1 maybe they removed quick charge support in beta mattcoz Pixel never had quick charge. AbdulB1 hmm interesting. I thought it has qualcomm processor so it must have qc 3.0 too. Must be some proprietary stuff or qualcomm must be asking for more money to enable it. mattcoz Google is pushing the open USB-C power delivery standard. AbdulB1 Display screen eats up most of my battery. I can't see what google is doing will fix it somehow. We need different types of screens now. iFeign Uhh, it's as if you expect things to use NO battery at all. Infinite battery life! Of course using the screen, aka, using the phone, is going to be the largest proportionate power drain - no matter how fancy the screen tech. AbdulB1 battery tech has still not improved and nor did the screen tech. I can accept that the screen tech will remain same for a long time but as far as batteries are concerned they can be improved , made for longer number of recharge cycles but that hasn't caught up with the manufacturers yet. One thing which can be done is increasing the battery capacity but we all know this is not happening as phone manufactures think it will make phones bulky , add weight and in long term affect the sale of newer devices. Latheryin Multi day battery life will not happen until new battery tech comes around. With people needlessly having screen on times of 5+ hours there is no way to keep a battery charged for extended periods. Krzysztof Jozwik I average 2 hours of screen on time a day. Just because some use their phone 24/7 doesn't mean we all do. I have a job where I'm not on my phone, at home I have better screens to get info from. The phone is there when I need it. Your nonstop use case is not the norm. Latheryin As do I but that is not the norm. Might want to look at any forum about battery life and looking at screen on times. Most want and use 5+ hours. It's mainly the older generation like us that doesn't need it and are not on the device all the time. Krzysztof Jozwik Obviously the forums about battery life have people winning that they want 48 hours of screen on. That is not the norm. Sure, lots of people want that, most do not. Latheryin Most want more screen on time. Why do you think battery life is such an issue. disqusdeeznuts My Moto Z Play begs to differ. Motorola does it right with this phone. It has a good size battery (3510), an efficient processor, and runs smooth. It can be done, but for some reason, it just isn't a focus for a majority of manufacturers. Latheryin Well sure all the devices with that mid range chip and battery combo can get ok battery life. I could easily. Get 2 days out of my device and it only has a 3200 battery. It is not the oem. It's people. They need to spend less time look at their phone and more time living life. Which many are unprepared for. Cakefish I'm going the leaked Moto X4 continues that legacy onwards! Rod Ever heard of the Moto z Play, or Lenovo P2? Latheryin As already stated on that. The moto has a mid tear chip. As for the Lenovo, nope. Can't say I have, it's either not sold in my country or a mid low tier device that I wouldn't have noticed. Just looked. They both use the same mid tier chip. Also that does have a good battery. But that like the K1000 with a 10000 battery are the exception and seldom are they flagship quality. WarpspeedScp The Moto z does not have an SD 820 on it. Neither does the P2. It's very annoying that manufacturers can't give us something functional instead of eye-candy for once. Rod While it's not top of line sillicon, real world testes have proven that, for everyday tasks, there's virtually no difference between the S625 ans 821 WarpspeedScp Well, my phone has an SD 650, and dolphin emulator just about keeps up (wind waker and super smash Bros). On an 820, there would definitely be better results. Paul Troy I have a better idea. Get the hardware manufacturers to put a bigger battery in their devices. 💡 Taedirk If we could convince hardware manufacturers to do something useful, we wouldn't be on yet another revision to how Android updates the OS. Alex Yeah so this way the horrible wakelocks (that Android makes almost impossible to manage) will be less visible. Cakefish Why not both? Zach Mauch All I want to know is can they stop wakelocks. JD Same bullshit every year. I'll believe it when I see it. Unless Android O somehow allows me to download more mAh. Morten Ulv Are you trying to say Android battery life hasn't improved VASTLY over the years? JD Yep in fact it's regressed Morten Ulv I have no such issues. Better battery all across the board. JD What ever you're smoking pass that shit around Morten Ulv Your shit must be stronger than mine. browngeek I miss the days of my Xperia Z3 Lollipop and Stamina mode. Used to get 48 hours and 5-6 hours SOT. D13H4RD2L1V3 I hope this actually does something when the final build is out. I'm getting tired of hearing of every new battery improvement in a new version of Android only to have a wakelock pretty much make all of that moot. Dennis Ulijn I am on the Android O beta, and i must say that the information i get from it it really useful! I never could find the wakelocks because i'm not rooted, but now i can easily see what apps use up battery in the background. Awake meditation app was in use for 15 minutes (meditation) and active in the background for 1 hour (basically, ever since the meditation)! "Restrict background usage" to on, and we'll see what it brings tomorrow. PI this is interesting .... :) ,, Whats the current update Dennis Ulijn I'm in Europe so I just woke up. I'll let you know end of the day. Sabin Bajracharya Meanwhile Google's own apps will somehow be able to bypass this restriction :D Michael Sørensen Google's own location services, Now cards, Chrome, etc. eats the most battery for me - even worse with location history on. How about fixing that first...? WarpspeedScp Try Firefox! Also, turn location off as soon as you can. mlm5em But with O, you can now turn off Background activity on an app specific basis. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/eaaaef5de863733535628a24f5b0d44f888ae3ff0cb89d1c8cffc0680083c526.png mattcoz Good to see there's an option to turn it off. Morten Ulv Very handy! IncCo Anything that improves the battery life is awesome John Monks I have concerns about this. There are some apps I *want* running in the background, but I don't want them filling up the notification shade. One example, Lightflow has to have a pointless notification in order to do the job I installed it to do. I know it's there, any consequences for my battery life are mine to live with. It would be OK if I could toggle a setting to permit a particular app to run a 'free running background service' silently but this is Google so I expect I'll have to put up with spam instead (and no, collapsed notifications are still notifications), or there will be a toggle that does nothing, like the 'ignore optimisation' setting that currently exists. Drakenoid There apparently is, check comments above, there's a screenshot. Cakefish It's about damn time. All hail Android O. AdamH So does it mean my phone will be useless? something_new Apple was right then Đức Thành I'm beginning to get excited again, even knowing that actually achieving this would take many years. Fidelator Allow us, the end user, to have absolute control over which apps can run in the background under certain conditions, I have disabled notifications on Facebook and Instagram yet they still have multiple persistent RAM hogging battery sucking services 100% of the time smeddy My next phone won't get a look-in without a 4000mah+ battery in it.

Build Apps 5x Faster For Half the Cost Enterprise Cloud Computing On Force.com AI and Machine Learning Take Center Stage at Google I/O 2017 By Shirley Siluk / Sci-Tech Today PUBLISHED: MAY 19 2017 At last year's Google I/O developer conference, CEO Sundar Pichai described how the world was shifting from mobile-first to one led by artificial intelligence (AI). This year, the company is focusing on "making AI work for everyone," he said. Now in its final day, this year's event has highlighted Google's increasing use of AI and machine learning for everything from email to job-hunting to healthcare. The company's latest initiatives even include one that uses machine learning to design better machine learning. During the event, Google also unveiled the second generation of its tensor processing units (TPUs), chips custom-designed for machine learning. The new cloud TPUs will be made available to developers and researchers via Google's Compute Engine, with an alpha program for users set to kick off sometime in the future. Immersive Computing for Everyone Google also continues to work on advancing its capabilities in augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR), and investing in platforms that will make them more accessible to a wider audience, according to VR/AR vice president Clay Bavor. "In order for immersive computing to be 'for everyone,' developers need to build great apps and experiences," Bavor wrote yesterday in a blog post. "We're working on tools and tech to help them do that." A new tool called Instant Preview, for example, is designed to let developers using VR headsets see the results of programming changes they make "in seconds, not minutes," Bavor said. Another tool coming soon, Seurat, is aimed at helping mobile developers achieve high-fidelity, real-time scenes and graphics that are equal to or better than those on desktops, he said. And this summer, Google will launch Chrome VR, which will enable users of the mobile VR platform Daydream to browse the Web in virtual reality. The tech giant also released an experimental build of its open-source Chromium browser with an API for augmented reality. Smarter, Faster Gmail Replies More commonly used Google apps are also becoming increasingly smart. For instance, the company announced Wednesday that its Smart Reply feature for Gmail will begin rolling out over the next two weeks for Android and iOS mobile devices. It will be available first in English, with Spanish rolling out in the coming weeks and more languages to follow. Smart Reply offers three response suggestions based on the content of an individual email message. A user can either tap one of the options to send it immediately, or select a response to edit it before sending. "Smart Reply utilizes machine learning to give you better responses the more you use it," Gmail software engineer Greg Bullock wrote on the G Suite blog. "So if you're more of a 'thanks!' than a 'thanks.' person, we'll suggest the response that's, well, more you!" Over the coming weeks, Google also plans to launch a new Google for Jobs feature that will incorporate AI into its Search function to make it easier for employers and job seekers to make better-focused matches. During today's final day of Google I/O, the schedule includes sessions on how to push the boundaries of machine learning, how to apply "built-in hacks of conversation" to voice-based user interfaces, and how to use behavioral insights to boost user retention. The 2017 Google I/O developer conference -- or festival, as the company likes to call it -- has been running May 17 - 19, at the Shoreline Amphitheatre in Mountain View, California.

Netflix was just the start: Google Play Console lets developers exclude app availability for devices that don't pass SafetyNet Rita El Khoury Follow View All Posts 2017/05/18 3:57am PDTMay 18, 2017 93 Plus 1 on G+ 108 Share on Facebook 82 Share on Twitter Total Shares283 Google News Last weekend, a huge turmoil swept the root-enthusiast Android community as it was discovered then confirmed that the Netflix app was being blocked from showing up in search results on the Play Store for rooted devices. At the time, Netflix said it was using Widevine to block unsupported devices, but that made no sense to us: the app was still functional if it was sideloaded, it was only not showing up as compatible in the Play Store. So what sorcery was Netflix really using?! Turns out it's a new function of the Google Play Console. As part of the updates announced for the Play Console at I/O 2017, Google mentions a new Device Catalog section under Release management that lets developers choose with intricate granularity which devices their app supports on the Play Store. Devices can be viewed and excluded by many attributes including RAM and SoC, but the important factor we're interested in is SafetyNet Attestation. New "Device catalog" lets devs manage the exclusions. Developers will be able to choose from 3 states shown in the top image: not excluding devices based on SafetyNet, excluding those that don't pass integrity, or excluding the latter plus those that aren't certified by Google. That means any dev could potentially block their apps from showing and being directly installable in the Play Store on devices that are rooted and/or running a custom ROM, as well as on emulators and uncertified devices (think Meizu and its not-so-legal way of getting Play Services and the Play Store on its phones). This is exactly what many of you were afraid would happen after the Play Store app started surfacing a Device certification status. This is different from the full SafetyNet API implementation that apps like Android Pay and Pokémon Go use. In the case of Pay/Go, the attestation check happens when the app is installed on your phone and doesn't allow it to run unless it passes the integrity test. But in the case of the Play Console, the attestation check happens when you're browsing the Play Store and only affects the availability of the app for your device. If the full SafetyNet API isn't included in the app itself, you will still be able to grab the APK from other sources, install it, and the app will work just fine. Still, this spells trouble for rooted users and the Android enthusiast community as a whole. Google keeps erecting more and more obstacles each day in the face of root and custom ROMs and even if this won't stop root users who should be knowledgable enough to know how/where to grab an APK and install it, it will make things more and more difficult and maybe less and less worth the trouble. But y'all are rebels and you'll keep on finding a way around it, won't you?

Nice move Google. Suicide_Note Not sure if serious, but either way, this was just a matter of time. YouNex Obviously not serious EowynCarter So, question : Is there anyway to get android O in the future on my nexus 6 and not having problems with this ? IF manufacturer where taking care of updating their devices, wouldn't be an issue... saf1927 If Magisk keeps working, yep. You can. Even my old Nexus 5 is on 7.1.2 and it passes SafetyNet. EowynCarter I want "just work" stuff. Not workaround. Maybe Magisk does the job for some, but not an acceptable solution from my point of view. Mainly the "we don't know if it will keep on working" part. saf1927 Well, it's the best solution so far and it has improved a lot since its inception. I never bothered since the Nexus 5 was a secondary device for me, but now that some apps won't show up anymore on the Play Store, I simply flashed Magisk and that's about it. I haven't tweaked anything. Plus, if you are already flashing a custom ROM, flashing an extra zip file isn't that much work anyway. EowynCarter True, but it's the phone I use dailly. I don't want apps sudendly not working, becasue google decided to push an update that broke magisk. mxwp well if you want things to "just work" then i guess get an iPhone EowynCarter Sadly, I'm beginning to think about that. But that would cause others frustrations. ED-Zが現れた! Well, people will just flock to root-supported apps... Milton P. I actually forgot when was the last time I Rooted a device. No biggie. Suicide_Note The bad thing is it isn't just root that causes problems. Simply unlocking the bootloader will produce the same result. Maxr1998 Just because it's no biggie for you, it doesn't mean everyone approves this. I am actually pretty concerned, because this limits the freedom over our devices even more.. Milton P. Define freedom, please. Maxr1998 Software freedom, to be more specific. You should have the freedom to use and modify your device and it's software however you'd like, and have fill control over it. That means, root access. And since the AOSP core IS free software, the 4 freedoms defined by Richard Stallman apply to it. What this change now introduces is that you're forced to decide between either giving up the freedom over your device or not using the app you wanted to download (which will probably have to be my choice, and that sucks). Milton P. But you're not giving up anything, you just have to make a choice. If you put that way, Google has the freedom of doing with the AOSP core whatever they want, the same way you can modify said core and do as you please, the difference is Google has more money and more responsibilities when it comes to their user base. XDA and other sites will still have a bunch of developers making whatever they please (within the AOSP terms) with the AOSP core. This will just change thinks for the people that use those ROMs bit realistically the vast majority of users won't feel the changes. Sad but true. h4rr4r That choice is giving up freedom you had before. The vast majority will see the rate of Android improvements slow as the Devs on XDA and the like lose interest. Android only exists because of Linux, now it is turning its back on that whole culture. Milton P. Well, I don't see your freedom compromised to be honest with you, but we're seeing things from different angles so that's that. Sorry for your loss in that case. h4rr4r You do not think losing control of your device is a loss of freedom? Milton P. Nope, is just a device, I have more important stuff going on, m device is a tool the same way a hammer is a tool, you can buy a hammer and use it as it is. Sometimes my device is a toy, if I buy a remote control car I'll modify it as long as it is possible, the same way I modify my phone. I have control over my phone. I can install whatever I want at my own risk. If I decide to root my phone I expect things to be broken. I remember when I had an HTC and I hated sense so I decided to install a custom ROM, I gave up the camera and I was aware of it. There was always some compromises with custom ROMs, nothing is changing. I rather have a safe device then a compromised one today, still my choice thou. h4rr4r So you want IOS. Got it. Over here I want freedom. I don't think homedepot should be allowed to tell me what I can hit with the hammer I bought. trparky Open platforms rarely stay open once they become popular. Once the Benjamins come rolling in it tends to override open. h4rr4r Tell that to Linus Torvalds. I am sure he will have many many fuck yous for you. trparky Linux is the rare situation. h4rr4r The rare situation like many others that created android and even google. trparky Yeah but look at Android, the walls are closing around it and there's nothing you can do about it. Face it man, the geeks may have built the system but the common man now rules it. Geeks love choice, yes, they do love their choice but your average person doesn't give a rat's ass about choice. All they want is a device that does what they need it to do when they want to do it. They have no inclination to learn how it works or why it works just as long as it does. This is what geeks do not and refuse to understand. h4rr4r Sure there is, stop using it. Then the common folks will have to follow us to the next platform. trparky As long as their is money involved in maintaining Android it doesn't matter if something better comes along, people will continue supporting Android because it makes them money. Money makes the world go round, get used to it. Maxr1998 ^ What @h4rr4r:disqus says. trparky Yep. The root and ROM community is such a small portion of the Android ecosystem that they really don't matter to them. People have been screaming at Google for years to get the Android house fixed up, this is them doing just that. You can't blame them for doing what the people have asked for. mxwp I agree with you, but sadly you only have freedom over hardware. You can do what you want with the device you buy. But with software you never actually buy it... you only buy a license to use it. Thus you have no real freedom with software. Maxr1998 Android is free software, Apache 2.0 license. At least the AOSP part of it. trparky But the Google parts of it are not covered under the Apache 2.0 license. That's essentially why ROM developers can't package the Google Play Services pack with the ROM itself and instead requires you to download a separate ZIP package from Google to install it separate from the ROM package. Android itself may be free and open but the Google Play Services part is not. Sudev There are far more than few arguments against root access but here are some: Root access is meant for experimental & development purpose and not for Daily Driver for any average user of the platform. Google Play Services & Apps available on Play Store are not "Free Software". Google as provider of Play Services infrastructure has much more liabilities then one can simply assume. And also the app developers have responsibility to protect end users' data. If device has root access available and any rouge app / maleware steals other apps data which is possible, who will be at stack? h4rr4r The ability to do anything I want with my things that I own. Milton P. You​ can do whatever you want with your device, nobody is stopping you. You might see that some apps are not showing up in the play store but you can still side load them, I still see freedom in your future. h4rr4r For how much longer? Soon these apps will ask play services if they are supposed to be installed on that device, at that point you can say goodbye to sideloading. If this is what people want then IOS was the platform for them. thecoolkid Ok Google, define freedom... 😁 Nick I would imagine a great deal of people on this site will be upset, but in actuality I don't think this will affect the user base of many apps that badly h4rr4r Not in the short term. However in the long term it will. Android only exists because of the FREE software movement. Nick Yes, but that doesn't apply to applications, which this is about. h4rr4r Think long term. Same thing applies. trparky No it won't because the root and ROM community is so small it doesn't matter to Google anymore. The 95% of people who simply want a device that works don't care and likely won't ever care. As long as they can play NetFlix, Pokemon Go, or whatever is the next craze they don't care. h4rr4r Again, that is short term thinking. Think past the end of your nose. Android exists because of linux. Google needs this small group to create the very stuff they rely on. trparky You overestimate the value that the community has now. Android may have needed the community back in the beginning to gain the foothold that it has in the market but not so anymore. Android has near 100% market penetration, they have achieved world domination. They don't need the community anymore, they have achieved their goals. h4rr4r Until they are unseated. IBM once had a monopoly on computing devices. They did not need the community to gain a foothold, they would not have a product to gain a foothold without the community. Android only exists because of a collection of those projects. trparky No, Android exists because Samsung, HTC, and LG make devices people want and it makes them money by the semi-truck full. The community doesn't mean shit now, all that matters to these companies is one thing... money, money, and more money. Oh, and did I mention money? This is capitalism man, money rules the world. If you don't make money you are dead. h4rr4r Please tell me how that would have happened without linux. Money loses to good engineering every day. Look at how linux killed solaris. trparky Tell me why Windows is the defacto monopoly on the desktop despite the fact that Linux is better in every damn way possible under the hood? That's right... money. h4rr4r Because the desktop is dead. The fight is over. They lost. Even money can't keep them relevant. trparky Oh, you're funny. The desktop is not dead, it will never be dead. When people need to do real work, they sit down at a desktop. When people want to play real games, they sit down at a desktop. When people need to type out anything longer than a page like a college term paper, they sit down at a desktop. The desktop is king and will always be king. Long live the desktop! h4rr4r The Desktop is a dead man walking. When they do real work, they use a Citrix session. When they game they use a console, or they are already nerds. When people type they can use a fucking chromebook. The desktop as you think of it died already. trparky Try and say that shit over at TechPowerUp, HardOCP, Overclock.net, TomsHardware, etc. and trust me when I say this... you'll be run out of town by people with pitchforks and torches. h4rr4r Those are all nerds. Those are the folks who have desktops running 3 different OSes. They are the folks who are pissed about android being locked down. trparky And your point being? You just admitted that only the "nerds" care about Android being open. Sure, those same "nerds" will go off and create a new platform but the rest of the people who are living in the real world and who don't care one damn bit about how it works will continue to use Android. h4rr4r Those people will eventually move to the new platform. Just like they did with Android. trparky And the same thing will happen to that platform in the future that's happening to Android now. Open platforms are nice and all, I'll admit that, but your average person doesn't care one bit. I dare you to go up to any person on the street and ask them anything about Android. What phone do they have? What model? Most will say "I don't know, something that my carrier gave me for cheap." h4rr4r The wheel of computing we call it. It has happened and will happen again. So what? trparky Which reinforces the idea that I said before, eventually all open systems will become closed (or less open) at some point in their life cycle. It usually happens when it becomes popular with the common man. Why? Because like I've been trying to get through your thick skull, the average person doesn't care how any of this stuff works so long as it works. h4rr4r The average person does not matter. Few open systems become closed. AOSP is still fine. trparky What the hell do you mean by "they don't matter"? They're the ones buying the devices, buying the apps, looking at the ads, etc. Just how the fuck does that translate to "they don't matter"? h4rr4r Because they don't. They don't create, they don't cause new things to be created. They are just users, just like I don't matter to how movies are created. trparky But without money from the people who are consuming said things developers won't make new stuff. Developers do have to eat you know and put a roof over their heads. h4rr4r The giant world of FOSS pretty much proves you wrong. Demand cannot create supply. I don't pirate anything kiddo. I have way too much to lose for that. One of those lawsuits I would actually have to pay, since I could. trparky I'll give a hint on how FOSS works a lot of the time. Some of the top tier Linux kernel developers actually work for companies and they just contribute code in their free time. They may work for Intel, AMD, nVidia, or God knows what but only after their day job is done. Why? Because they need money and they need to eat. This is a basic requirement for people in this world. They need money!!! People don't just write code for the love of it, even Linus Torvalds who's in charge of the Linux kernel itself works for the Linux Foundation and yes, he gets paid for his work to the tune of $10 Million a year. Sorry to burst your bubble man but FOSS projects aren't all happy, happy, joy, joy here... people need to be paid real money to be able to eat, drive a car, put a roof over their heads, etc. On second thought, I'm not sorry I burst your bubble! You need it burst! PEOPLE NEED TO BE PAID REAL FUCKING MONEY!!!! h4rr4r No, they get paid to contribute. During the work day. Not as a hobby. Lots of projects are like that. I won't say exactly how I know about that ;) Their employers just aren't as short sighted as you. Linus did not however create linux to get rich. Great code like great art gets created because it must be. People do what they love. Kid, you will get it one day. When you have enough that you aren't worried about it each day, money stops being that big of a deal. Don't worry everybody goes through a phase like you are now. trparky Dude, we are not the Federation of Planets here living in a happy, happy, joy, joy world in which people can just do whatever they want to do without a care in the world. As long as human greed exists there will always be a need for money. And believe you me, greed will never go away unless we breed a new kind of human and I don't see that happening any time soon. Gene Roddenberry's future will never happen, it just won't. Contrary to a lot of geek dreams it just won't. h4rr4r No idea where you got that idea. Never suggested it. My point was the personal relative value of increasing income drops as income goes up. If you make minimum wage doubling your income is a huge deal. Adding the same amount to my income would not get me to take a job I like less. Offering it to Linus would be a waste of time. Yes, some people will keep chasing dollars, they are the exception not the rule. The employers are working on enlightened self interest. Either they use the FOSS product, gain market advantage with direct knowledge, use it for marketing or believe they are getting something else. PostgreSQL for example has a lot of paid contributors who work for companies that either provide customization, consulting or depend on the project. Others just because it increases quality. Commercial software by and large is not high quality. I have seen a lot of it and 90% if you tried to submit it to a FOSS project of any size would get you denied and possibly mocked. This system continues to be more innovative because it is easy to continue to expand. Anyone with a good idea can fork if their idea is not accepted. trparky > My point was the personal relative value of increasing income drops as income goes up. Tell that to the people in Washington or any CEO that demands ever increasing yearly salaries and end of year bonuses all while raping the companies that they work for. Tell that to the psychopaths on Wall Street. For as long as their is money, people will want more of it. Anyone who says that they don't is flat out lying. h4rr4r Those are the exception not the rule. That is why you call them psychopaths. Honestly, correcting for inflation I really don't care that much if I ever make more. Would it be nice sure, would I give up anything I like about my job? No. If you could double my income but it prevented me from contributing to FOSS projects or owning code I generate off the clock, I would not take that deal. If money was enough to make people do anything MS would have offered Linus $11 million a year to not write it. Heck, Sun would have done it while they were still around. trparky Either you're a child that doesn't know how the adult world works or you're a fucking troll. h4rr4r So you have no idea who makes stuff, neat. I guess you think Henry Ford should have made a faster horse. trparky Oh, I know who makes the stuff I use but I also make sure that they are paid! I give money to those developers who write the programs that I enjoy and if I can't pay them I won't use their programs. I only use a program if I can pay for it. I have put money into their tip jars on their web site, I look for PayPal links and I donate even if it's something small like $5. They deserve it! h4rr4r Good for you! There is a lot of great software that does not make money that way. Some even just ask is that you follow the license, like linux which mediatek steals by not releasing kernel source. So I hope you avoid buying that kind of thing. trparky MediaTek controller chips are known to suck so I don't buy them out of that reason alone. h4rr4r Now I have given you another good reason to avoid them. Bunch of thieves. Rita El Khoury I don't even remember when I last bootloader unlocked. But I know this move toward closing the ecosystem further and further will have ripples in the future. The enthusiast community flocked toward Android for its openness and we have custom ROMs and their enterprising devs to thank for HUNDREDS of new features that they implemented first and everyone clamored for and applauded until they became features in AOSP. If Google thinks it can steer this ship alone and it knows best what to do next, we may have less and less interesting features in the future and more and more of what only one entity thinks is best, not a diverse set of opinions. Nick Given that this only gives the developer the option of requiring these checks, it makes me believe that Google had to do this for some companies that have regulatory or other kinds of requirements. Which is a shame for the rooted (and unlocked?) community, but understandable. Shame Google is most likely going to take the blame here in this comment section though. Rita El Khoury Well, maybe they had to, but that won't stop any developer from implementing it without any regulatory or legal requirement pushing them to do so. Nick Right, which puts this choice on the developer, not Google. Google was stuck behind a rock and hard place, perhaps. EowynCarter Well, google is certainly to blame for not planing to update my nexus 6 to android O. And now I can't even use custom rom as plan B without losing some apps :( Suicide_Note Boo hoo. Buy a new phone and quit crying that Google doesn't support phones forever. EowynCarter Fine can you order a pixel XL and ship it to me in France ? Plus, my nexus 6 still works, I hate having to replace working stuff. Makes no sense, economically and ecologically speaking. Suicide_Note I'll sell you my XL when I'm done with it, but only after i get the Pixel XL 2. :) EowynCarter Well, I do hope Google sells the "pixel 2 "( or whatever its name) here. For now, I'm'just hoping my nexus 6 don't break. Else I might jump on the iOS ship. I'm not convinced the the other android alternatives. Note 8 would be the closest, but touchwiiz, delayed updates.... I'm spoiled after a few years with a nexus. Suicide_Note There always eBay or Swappa if you want to get a first gen Pixel. I was looking at prices over the weekend, and mint condition Pixels are going for about $450. EowynCarter Not so much in France. And eBay for suff that cost more that a few bucks, too risky. Plus, the pixel is getting "old" by now. Wilton Daniel Pinto Troll found trparky Yet Microsoft still supports Windows 7 EIGHT YEARS LATER! How come Microsoft can do that yet Google can't? Alex Louderback Actually, that's Qualcomm EowynCarter Source for this ? trparky And Qualcomm can go fuck themselves. Gee... I wonder why they're being hit with an anti-trust lawsuit. Could this be one of many reasons why? trparky Yes, Google is to blame for that. There's no damn reason why your Nexus 6 can't run Android O other than the fact that they just don't want to. Bojan Bunić My bootloader was unlocked prior to changing the mobo on my 5X, courtesy of Booty Loops. Root, well, probably before I got my Nexus 4. Although I'll see how it'll go on in the future, as we don't have Pixels here, so the only near stock possibility is either OnePlus, or some other device and a custom ROM. Milton P. Agree 100% with you, I mean I remember the old days when I hated HTC's Sense, I literally decided that a phone without a camera was better than whatever HTC did back then, but Android has evolved quite a lot nowadays, don't get me wrong, I do believe that custom ROMs did a great job showing Google what the users want but that won't change, as long as someone shows Google what people want Google will keep improving Android, because there's no limits. Now if they go the Apple way and lock EVERYTHING then we'll be fucked, I'm the meantime developers will find a way around the system pushing Google along. Premsuraj An open bootloader and root actually solves a lot of problems still existing in AOSP. The Nougat update absolutely destoryed the battery life of many Nexus 6P devices, with Google only focussing on the Pixels, there was no fix in it. I unlocked, used Franco Kernel + naptime + Greenify and I now I get adequate battery life. Another feature I can think of is theming. Material design is good, but the whiteness is rage inducing Maxr1998 Well, fuck them. Let's just hope not many devs will use this, and Google won't enable this by default anytime soon. Maxr1998 The more I think about this, the more concerned I get. This will reduce the freedom over our devices, and also limit developers in the awesome things they could do before because of Android's openness. I am all in for device security and fighting against malware, trojans and phishing applications, don't understand me wrong, but that doesn't mean that you have to take people away their freedom - just look at how Linux (GNU and Linux) is doing it. Tom Westrick How does this limit developers? If anything it gives them more control. Maxr1998 Fair point, I should have been more specific. With "developers", I meant rom developers and modders, app developers only if they require root access for their apps. "Normal" developers can use this to enforce a "secure" (read: DRM locked-down) environment, but that's not really a good thing in my opinion.. (Refer to my other comments.) trparky You're angry at the wrong people, you should be angry at Hollywood; they're the ones that are demanding this kind of stuff. Their content, their rules; it's how things are in the real world. They have to do what they need to do to protect their investments, plain and simple. We don't necessarily have to like it, hell... we may even hate it, but that's how it is. You want the content? Play by their rules. Colin Richardson If you are an app developer and want your app to run on custom roms..... don't turn on "Requires SafetyNet"... bekifft We are increasingly living in the future Richard Stallman warned us about. With Google taking all these steps, may as well go back to using jailbroken iPhones. Bart Janusz I've already enabled it and I know at least 3 others devs that did it as well. I really don't care about root per se, but custom roms and xposed is source of countless problem as both are buggy as hell. Maxr1998 But in which way does that influence you? Xposed can introduce bugs to the system, sure, but it won't affect the performance of your app unless it itself is modded, so you probably don't have to fear bad reviews for bad performance anyway. And custom roms? LineageOS on my mother's Moto G runs like a champ and much better than the 5.1 stock rom before. And in my experience as a dev, there were much more incompatibilities with Samsung TouchWiz than with AOSP-based custom roms. refthemc I'm sure he's just trying to avoid the headache of emails he gets daily from users who have no idea that it's their fault the app is not working or crashing... Bart Janusz Indeed, not to mention extra crash and ANRs reports which seems to influence app positioning. Maxr1998 But why? The device may behave more buggy at some parts because of Xposed (and mine definitely ran like shit on MM because of some mods, but I NEVER blamed any apps), but the apps itself won't run worse if not modded - normally they should even run better if you only use performance mods like Greenify, NLP Collector wakelock disabler and other light mods. I don't think he gets many reports anyway, considering what @marcusmarcus2:disqus said. Bart Janusz You may not, but many users do, and as I said there are a lot of bogus ANRs and crash reports. Since my app depends heavily on low level OS elements both custom ROMs and xposed are deal breakers (and you really should check source, since I do not update my website as I moved to G+/FB but app has sizable user base given its niche and I'd to deal with ROM/xposed issues fequently). Maxr1998 Well, but the same type of users also give bad reviews etc. without using any mod or root. You generalize modders to only cause problems, and therefore lock out everyone. About your app/website thing: fair point, I didn't look at it yet, and have to apologize for being a little rude. marcusmarcus2 You need to take your own advice, "you really should check source". If you moved to G+/FB, then why does your app on the play store still point to the same website as well. Or at least put a link on the old website that directs to G+/FB. There is nothing that points to your so called G+/FB source. So @Maxr1998:disqus has no other source to check at the moment. Bart Janusz Not that I care but if you try to draw conclusion about app you should probably visit Play Store listing. Anyhow that's really not important I just chimed in to explain why developer will use this. I've choose to do so due to extra burden which in effect hurts majority of my user base, one of my colleagues cited lucky patcher and freedom (which I think is not such a good idea but its his choice). trparky You may not blame the apps because you know better but most people don't understand that, most people see a crashing app and suddenly you see, as the developer, a ton of comments saying that your app sucks. h4rr4r Please do tell us about your apps so we can be sure to avoid them on any devices we have not yet rooted. marcusmarcus2 His disqus profile leads to this website http://artflowstudio.com/ which has a few apps listed. Art oriented apps. There is only 1 update on that website since 2014, so I don't think I would be to concerned about installing one of his apps. Jordan Palmer Nice detective work. Adrian I can see a lot of refund requests coming from people who paid for apps and suddenly are told "Nope. Not for you anymore." A lot of us are rooted and buy apps and you'd better believe noise will be made if an app I use daily, that I paid for, suddenly breaks with an update because it's no longer blessed by the dev to run on my device. It's your app and you can do what you want with it, but there is always another side to the coin. BAlGaInTl That's not the way that Netflix worked it, and I doubt other developers of paid apps would either. I have a OnePlus One, that I run Lineage OS on since the original Cyanogen OS is now defunct and does not receive any updates. Netflix simply doesn't update to v 5+. It still works just fine. I may not get the newest and latest features, but part of that is on me for using a device that is dated. I'm not one of those users who, because I paid for an app once, fells that I should get all of the updates from now until the end of time. That isn't sustainable for developers. It could very well be that Netflix has some new features/offerings in the works in which they are getting pressure from outside sources to push this. A lot of valid reasons for a developer to enable the check exist. As long as they do it in the same manner that Netflix has, I don't see the issue. Adrian And just like Pokemon Go, eventually you'll get a message that you need to upgrade to the latest version or the app won't work, you know, that new version that won't let you actually log into it anymore. We've already seen this happen so let's not pretend that it isn't the next logical step. They aren't going to keep letting people sign in indefinitely with an app that doesn't have the security level they want. It's naive to think that hey I can just stick with the last version that works for root. It takes all of what, the time it takes to create a switch that says minimum version required to log in is "DRM version" BAlGaInTl Good Point. I recognize that. But it seems that the blame (in general) is being directed at Google in many of these posts. If that scenario happens, it isn't Google that blocked you from accessing Netflix. The need for this level of security is on the increase. The same users demanding better security and longer updates are the first ones to cry foul when Google starts laying the groundwork for exactly what they have asked for. Adrian I think there is a way to do both that doesn't piss off a very active community that helped take Android from a very very very ugly, second class OS to what we have now. I know a lot of us remember just how crippled Android was and it was the root/mod community that produced the bulk of what is now standard on Android. There needs to be a way to secure the devices AND not turn their back on the developer community that contributes. The idea, in Netflix's case, that root = pirate is insane. Why in the world would someone prefer to rip content on their phone to say a computer or XBox that is never going to move and can do it while you get on with your life? They're doing something for the sake of saying they're doing something, but if they think it's going to make a dent in piracy they, and the studios are nuts. I watch a lot of Netflix and still prefer to buy discs. People who do things the right way and are perfectly happy paying for content shouldn't have to jump through hoops to watch it. Those of us who root usually have a handful of things that stock Android is not doing for us. It's why we root. If all of these things were available in stock, my reasons for rooting would disappear but I don't see that happening any time soon. I think Android is getting so much better but if they make it exactly like iOS, might as well go to the dark side because Apple's apps tend to be more polished, come out first and OS updates are frequent. Don't bite the hand that feeds you just because you're getting more popular. BAlGaInTl I think that Netflix is a good example. It is HIGHLY likely that the reason for recent unpopular changes (see also VPN blocking) are being driven by other entities. It isn't that Netflix thinks its a problem, but the people that control a large portion of their content do. root pirate but it does introduce a security risk. I don't see how Google is turning their backs on developers. Developers are free to develop as they see fit and choose (at least for the moment) whether or not they will implement the SafetyNet check. The inherent problem is that a circumvented security is still circumvented and can no longer be considered secure. I can clearly see why some apps would and should frown upon that. Maybe not Netflix and Mario (IMHO), but certainly something like bank and payment apps. I don't think the inherent open nature of android will ever reduce to the level of iOS. But some changes have to occur to meet the needs/desire of the majority. Security is inherently difficult. The easier and more flexible you try to make it, the less secure it becomes. Adrian I do think banking apps should run in a secure space. Completely agree with that, but I disagree with root = less secure. My nexus devices stopped getting OS and security updates. Nothing. VERY insecure and dangerous. I rooted them, updated the OS with images from XDA developers and my devices that were once easy targets are more secure. There is always two sides to it. I see that Google is finally trying to take security seriously on Android and doing things in layers that completely cut out the vendor AND the carriers is the right step. Right now, Root is the only way to update a perfectly good device like my Nexus tablet tablet that the vendor said "oh well" to. Until Google has a REAL strategy in place to keep ALL Android devices secure, root will be necessary. Not everyone wants to or can upgrade devices every two years because they get abandoned. My father doesn't need an S8. He does need a device that gets security updates for more than a year after purchasing his phone. BAlGaInTl You are exactly correct, and I'm in the same situation with my OnePlus One. But in working to increase your security level, you leave holes behind. The key words that you used are "more secure." I agree. You are "more secure." But still (probably) less secure than a device that has been thoroughly tested, certified, and passes SafetyNet without hacks. Google has been open that they are working on security updates. They have improved significantly over the last couple years in getting those out. I feel that they are putting in place a real strategy to keep Android devices secure. This is part of that groundwork. I also feel that they are actively looking to replace Android in it's current state, and I can't say I blame them. The only real strategy may be to take lessons learned and start over. Lucky for them, they have the resources to do so. trparky > take lessons learned and start over Pretty much. The worst thing that they did from the very beginning was to allow for the OEMs to do what they wished. Google essentially made a deal with the devil when they released Android to the world. They wrote no requirements into the Android agreements that the OEMs agreed to to require updates to be a necessary thing. Big mistake Google. BAlGaInTl The really needed to in order to get their foot in the door of the market. If it would not have been open source from the beginning, none of the major manufactures would have bought off on it. The fact that they could use it for free (essentially) and still be able to customize on top of it is what sold it. trparky And now look at it, Android is a fucking mess of non-updated insecure devices that are ripe for anyone to be able to take over and turn into a botnet. trparky And you should be raising holy hell with the OEM that made that device! Just because your device is old doesn't mean that it shouldn't still be supported. Windows 7 is nearly eight years old and it still receives Windows Updates. Why can't your device? BAlGaInTl Normally, I would agree, but the OnePlus One is a special case. The OEM operating system is the now defunct Cyanogen OS. I had to balance having the original OS without updates, or running another with updates. The phone is now almost three years old. If I bought a PC with Windows on it three years ago, and Microsoft had since gone out of business, should the PC manufacturer be responsible for providing Windows 7 updates? Even though the PC is beyond it's support date? Sure, I can increase the security by switching to another OS that is updated. It may even be a Windows clone. But if a software developer decided to only support "original, unmodified" PC configurations, that would be within their right. trparky But it can be adapted to run LineageOS. Sudev There is bit difference in analogy here: OnePlus manufactured the phone and Cynogen Inc customized AOSP Android OS for it, they didn't developed it from ground up. I understand that Cynogen INC is out of business now too. However in PC world, it would be the case that you purchased a PC from Dell and get Microsoft Windows OS with some additional Dell software. If Dell or developer of that custom software goes out of business you still get OS update for your PC. Its not android OS itself out business here. Adrian and for the record, I absolutely agree that it was the content providers and not all on Netflix. trparky You should be demanding that OnePlus send an official update to your device. So what if your device is old? It should be still supported. Windows 7 is still supported nearly eight years later, why can't your device be supported for that long as well? Plumplam Who cares except for a bunch of XDA nerds? If it means better security then I'm all for it. Dmitri Smirnov Well, for starters, it doesn't mean better security, since it does nothing to address the problems with vulnerable outdated android versions that will be "certified", but will allow malicious apps to quietly escalate their privileges and do their dirty work, but will block "uncertified" custom roms that actually have all the recent secuirity patches and give user full control over who has root access and how. Also, "bunch of XDA nerds" are the source of a lot of features that had their trial run in custom ROMs and then were adopted to the AOSP. Should I remind you of "The Oak and the Pig" fable? Alienate the developers bringing new ideas to the ecosystem - lose the competetive edge you had over other OSes saf1927 Actually, custom ROMs never really have the latest security patches despite what they claim since kernels aren't maintained and no proprietary blobs is updated anymore. If ROM developers were OEMs, they'd be violating their agreements with Google by bumping the patch level without actually addressing all the vulnerabilities. Dmitri Smirnov Well they patch the AOSP to the same level as latest official one and kernel - if it's possible to do so without breaking the compatibility with compiled blobs or at least on the level of latest official firmware. So in the end run it's at least as secure as the official firmware, often - much more so. saf1927 If you look at the security bulletin, most vulnerabilities come from proprietary drivers and require these to be updated. On a supported device, these are provided by the chip manufacturers to the OEMs, on an unsupported device they aren't updated anymore. A custom ROM can only fix userspace security issues. In the end, bumping the patch level without addressing all vulnerabilities in that patch gives a false sense of security to users. Dmitri Smirnov If anything, this is an argument for forcing OEMs to opensource their blobs. For some reason community is much better at releasing the fixes for what they can change (userspace), while OEMs generally stop caring as soon as device is out the door. saf1927 The problem goes beyond OEMs unfortunately. All the phones you can buy are assembled with off-the-shelf components that they buy from other manufacturers and it is them that provide the binary blobs to the OEMs. If they stop supporting components, the OEMs can't do anything. For the chip, it's companies like Qualcomm, Samsung, Mediatek etc. that need to support it with up-to-date drivers. Once they stop, the life-cycle of a phone comes to an end. trparky And that is probably one of many reason why Qualcomm is facing a nice fat anti-trust lawsuit. Serves them right. trparky That ain't ever going to happen. There's no way they're going to allow for their intellectual property to be open for all the world to see and have it cracked open. It would be corporate suicide since their competitors would be able to reverse engineer their stuff. Suicide_Note Never heard of "The Oak and the Pig" before. Could you tell me more? Seriously. Dmitri Smirnov http://www.aliceswonderland.eu/Alice-ska350-en.html Maxr1998 Ah, Lessing. Going to read the original version in a minute :) username_not_valid Thats a very generous view of the custom ROM community. It might be true of a few, very few devs, but most ROMs are unsupported garbage with serious security issues. Dmitri Smirnov Maybe so, but out of this cesspool of garbage CyanogenMod was born, which became LineageOS. I'd say their quality standard appeals me more than a lot of OEMs. username_not_valid Cyanogen and Lineage was what i had in mind.. Each to his own i guess. BAlGaInTl Yes and no. I run Lineage on my OnePlus One because Cyanogen OS is no longer supported. I can say with certainty that Lineage introduces stability issues that I have to deal with to be up to date. Wilton Daniel Pinto Ninna pooty bewarci Qwip Consider the bigger picture. Right now, users are being shuffled into a situation where they must restrict the control they have over their device if they want to be able to use Netflix (and presumably banking apps will follow soon). That may seem fine, and from some security perspective it is probably a good thing. How much control do you have over your _laptop_? How much do you want? Right now, we're blissfully able to install unsigned software on our computers (although various OSs will complain about it), but will that last? How long will it be before we can only open our banking interface on our laptop using a trusted, digitally signed browser on a machine that is using secure boot and can only run signed binaries? I can understand the direction that Netflix (and others) are coming from, and to them it may even make sense. The question is: what is the cost of ceding control over our devices/machines in order to be able to watch netflix, etc. trparky Yeah and that's why Windows is the virus filled cesspool that it is today. Windows 10 is slowly changing Windows to be an app store based ecosystem in which all apps will be sandboxed. It's coming to the desktop near you. saf1927 I hope Magisk (or other similar mods in the future) keep working, so to prevent this. Not a problem on my Pixel XL since I haven't rooted it, but on my Nexus 5 Magisk allows it to pass Safety Net even though it's running a custom ROM (7.1.2) and it's rooted. Hendrik Leppkes SafetyNets primary purpose is to secure devices for Android Pay, and when you deal with actual money transactions on your device, you really don't want any hack interfering with it - so I'm quite certain they'll do whatever they can to break hacks like this and ensure the security and integrity of the device. h4rr4r No, its primary purpose is to make the device trustworthy for others not the person who paid for it. This is how it makes it "secure" for android pay. You are a possible threat and this closes that. Suicide_Note It would seem that Google is erecting a wall around their garden, too. EowynCarter While Apple opens iOS more and more. YouNex According to the support/help page, a device is not certified if it stops getting Android updates. How fuck up is that ? I don't get it. My Moto X has always been on stock ROM, yet it's showing up as non certified. Yes it's rooted + system modifications, but at no point is it stated that root prevents it from being certified. Suicide_Note Really? You can't understand why your rooted/system modified device is non-certified? YouNex I know how to read, but this is vague https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/b6f710b8628f0e09ab73ba144c133a2c9b1fe1325b353ae7dc1636f2776b2ac0.png "Not secure" jonzey231 Root and/or unlocked bootloader = Not certified. YouNex It says nothing about root or bootloader https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/b6f710b8628f0e09ab73ba144c133a2c9b1fe1325b353ae7dc1636f2776b2ac0.png ast00 Can't wait until LastPass excludes root users... Fuck them. Adonis K. If they do, I'm cancelling my subscription... Naxx ENVY Fuck them and yet they haven't done anything yet ... #internetlogic Also i know right , crazy for a company that stores your passwords to make themselves more secure . ABSOLUTE CRAZY , RAGE RAGE RAGE Jordan Palmer I don't understand your reasoning or rationale for these two statements. ast00 The second part is related to Google. Sorry about the confusion. Believe it or not, most of us root users keep SELinux in it's Enforcing state. This means we are safe. Nothing gets root rights without us knowing. Our phones are just as safe if not safer than most stock phones. JATIN BANSAL SafetyNet test can be passed using Magisk Manager. I am using it and it works fine for me. Even in play store, my device is certified. May be this helps someone. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/3756499ff5876545740cd0e88e38961bb2c327d90fc43f5801f4bce5d802c990.png https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/44185f640490cb506a68a3414579bd345123f7d52ee2e11802d31d5141db11ae.png Nick Most people are worried about the future when the exploits that Magisk uses are patched and it continues to make it harder for people to get around this. JATIN BANSAL That's what I am also worried about. I just posted this for those who are already rooted and for now want to keep the root. My main purpose of rooting was to flash lineage OS. I think custom rom is the only way of staying updated to latest version of Android as google itself doesn't update their phones after 2 years (18 months I think) for reasons they have. I think if someone buys a flagship device which costs 700$+, it should have 3-4 years of full software update support. 😆😄 2 years of major OS version updates and 3 years of security patches. After 3 years, its time to buy a new phone cuz its so old anyway. trparky Says you! Windows 7 was released on July 22, 2009 and they still support it EIGHT YEARS LATER! And they plan on supporting it until the year 2020 which means it will be supported for a total of ELEVEN YEARS! If Microsoft can do it, Google can too!!! Does Microsoft suddenly say "Your machine is too old, go buy a new one"? No, they continue to give you Windows Updates for years later. We should also be demanding that the Android OEMs do so as well. A Samsung Note 5 has more than enough hardware in it to run Android 7 but no... we can't do that, we need to make money so we don't update them to force you to buy a new device. Lambdadelta Magisk...alright, thanks for the tip-off. I really must get it. TadMSTR Magisk doesn't always pass SafetyNet. I have some devices it fails on. However, several other devices it works just fine. Make sure you turn on the hide root option, it's off by default. Lambdadelta Well, I do have a problem, and that is my device is not able to download it directly from Google Play, so I have to get the APK from XDA. I dunno why this is the case for my phone though. Is it because it's a 4.4.4? Either way, I'll get the APK moved to my phone later tonight. Teodor Axel Johan Jönsson I have activated hide root option, and it passes SafetyNet, but in Google Play Store, it still shows uncertified. What app should I hide root from to get Play Store to show Certified? JATIN BANSAL As per XDA: Q: Safety Net fails after enabling MagiskHide A: Magisk can only hide Magisk core features, for Magisk modules it depends on what the module does. If your ROM itself is not able to pass SafetyNet, then there is nothing Magisk can help. Your best bet is 100% stock ROMs, because your phone manufacturer is forced to release a device passing CTS. Teodor Axel Johan Jönsson What in Magisk Hide did you check/how did you do it? Google Play Store? Or Play services? Because here it says uncertified :( JATIN BANSAL Just clear app data of play store. Now it will show your device certified Teodor Axel Johan Jönsson Thanks! Muzaffar I believe that root and custom rom makes android what it is now. This feels like betrayal for Android enthusiast. username_not_valid Well maybe in the very early days (maybe), but not any more. Rooted phones make up a tiny fraction of active devices. Muzaffar It's not about active devices. It's about how android develop together with community (well as i remember) I believe that those "rooted user" contribute many things that make android right now. I still remember status bar (and nav bar) color change was implemented on Kitkat before it becomes official on lollipop. Also, we can't forget how badly mobile active network bug happens in lollipop if it's not those "rooted user" who found out the fix via xposed. and i believe there are still more. trparky We can blame the OEMs for that kind of stuff because of things like locked bootloaders, eFuses, etc. username_not_valid Or we can blame ROM makers for it because they kept breaking the devices causing warranty claims. Naxx ENVY no offence but that's small thinking ... i'd say 90% of people on Android devices don't want or even know about root, heck it may even be 95% ... security is more of a concern, sure it annoys us geeks, but that's the 5% at most. Muzaffar And about half of android devices is left outdated. Not to mention bugs that unsolved on previous android. I'll pick a dumb phone instead, if android becomes a closed platform. trparky And truth be told that's why I have an iPhone. I simply got sick and tired of the lack of updates so I told myself I'm going to the iPhone and have been happy ever since. OK sure, it may not have all of the customization features that Android has but I can be guaranteed that I will get software and security updates on time, every time, regardless of my carrier of choice. refthemc I think you misread his comment, he's saying that root and custom roms got Android to where it is TODAY not saying that it is necessary TODAY. And I agree. trparky It pretty much comes down to this. Google is simply targeting a much larger piece of the pie. You can't blame them for trying to do what is necessary to protect not only the platform but the Android brand itself. Qwip Well, it isn't like there is anywhere else to go though, is it? Google can basically throw enthusiasts who have promoted and fostered android development under the bus - they don't need them any more. trparky Money trumps community. Always has, always will. username_not_valid Ad blocking was the last holdout reason to root for me, but even thats no longer a good reason with things like Adhell, Adguard etc I have no other reason to root now, custom ROMs are generally garbage, and bloat can usually be uninstalled or disabled, so its just not needed. Adonis K. custom ROMs have nothing to do with root... thevigilante Custom ROMs have uncertified flag in Play Store Mike Avellanosa Not all, though George Byers My Nexus 7 2013 is passing safteynet running Lineage unrooted. Wilton Daniel Pinto Let me guess, you have a Pixel. Or you wouldn't call custom ROMs bloated while the reality is other way round username_not_valid Wouldn't touch a Pixel actually. username_not_valid Should be noted that I didn't call custom ROMs bloated, I guess you misread it. Wilton Daniel Pinto Oh yeah, I misread it . My bad Zach Mauch This is going to cause the same problem I see in governments work with security. They will blindly block things like root and bootloader unlock regardless of if it poses any credible threat because it FEELS more secure. Blah!!!!!! Naxx ENVY it IS more secure, not just " feels" h4rr4r More secure for them, not for me the owner of the device. Besides, not even for them in the long term. An up to date ROM has many exploits patched that a two versions out of date and 12 months behind on security patches OTA has. Zach Mauch What I mean is they will apply restrictions because they easily can and it gives a warm fuzzy for them. They will do this regardless of the impact to the user. The analogy here is that in my job I am constantly unnecessary restrictions and bureaucracy that make doing my job much more difficult. For instance, we are disallowed from using remote desktop on standalone computer networks. It would make our job MUCH MUCH easier in many circumstances and save money on software as I could remote into my PC from anywhere in the building. Yet they deny us that and claim security. jonzey231 So this will force people to install apps from unauthorized sources, thus making the whole Android malware issue that much more prevalent. Great.. Suicide_Note Unless being held at gunpoint, no one is forced to install apps from unauthorized sources. That's a user's CHOICE. jonzey231 You know what I mean. Stop playing devil's advocate on everyone's posts. Eric Braun He's not incorrect. Kyle R Krcmaric "Stop providing an alternate viewpoint to my own." It's just comments. Anyway, I think Google also announced that even sideloaded apps will get scanned by their new Google Play Protect service, which may help nullify the risk of sideloading in the first place. d0x360 That's not an alternate viewpoint unless your view is "don't install any apps ever" There is no logical argument to defend this move by Google. None. username_not_valid Yes there is. Come content creators will not allow a provider to support a rooted or otherwise compromised device. Right or wrong in your eyes thats the reality, and in order for Android to be able to have such services Google have to do this. d0x360 What you said isn't an alternate viewpoint lol you are just repeating the reason Google is doing this which everyone agrees is a fact. As for this new comment...a rooted phone isn't compromised. Tell me...what would a rooted user do with Netflix that would make Netflix want to block them? Are they worried about people copying movies because if they think Android is the vector for that action they are idiots. All they are doing is making a problem by allowing bad actors to inject malware into a Netflix apk that could be installed by both root and unrooted users. Genius! Give me 1 good reason to block rooted phones from an app like oh I dunno, Mario run or whatever it's called. Any answers you give are false. Wanna know why? Hacked apks exist to allow cheating and they can be installed by anyone rooted or not. In fact I'd stake my life that your average unrooted user is installing more modified apk files to cheat in games or whatever than any rooted user. People who root are generally better educated about the Android eco system and do less dumb stuff. As for Netflix I cancelled my account on the day they did this and now I just use a friends account so they lost a subscriber due to this move and I rarely ever used the app. Sure 1 person closing an account that's existed since the day they opened isn't going to do much but I vote with my wallet and if a company does something I dislike then they simply don't get my money. The first person I asked gave me their login info and I made a profile. It's just like how I share my HBO subscription with someone else. Easy easy. username_not_valid See my previous comment. Its not for me to argue, the fact is content providers want it, fair or not, end of story, therefore its going to happen. The tiny number of rooters out there are meaningless to them, and Google. Netflix has to do this because the providers of its non-original content demand it. Its not Netflix fault, they either do it or lose shows. Losing large amounts of their content would affect their subscription base several orders of magnitude more than losing rooted users, who chances are, use the service on more than their phone or tablet anyway. d0x360 Once again I ask... what about a rooted device is dangerous to an app and also this is now a second question, what makes it compromised? BAlGaInTl Clearly you've made up your mind on the issue, but I'll give it a go. It isn't necessarily the root that is dangerous to an app or vice versa. The compromise comes from other apps/processes that can take advantage of root. If you don't understand that, then you don't understand what root really is. It has a lot of valuable uses, but it can also be dangerous. To address your previous statement, just because it rubs me the wrong way. So your "solution" was to cancel your Netflix account and then steal the content? So clearly, you aren't "actually" affected by the change, because you can still watch Netflix. You do realize that watching their content is also valuable to them and makes them money? If you want to boycott Netflix for their practices, then by all means do. Otherwise, it just comes across as hypocritical IMHO. d0x360 I don't believe I asked you. No I'm not stealing Netflix content, it's being paid for and Netflix has many times in the past encouraged account sharing. Of course they did so in the hopes you would join but they still allow it. I paid my Netflix dues. Day 1 4 disc member, then as soon as it was available I upgraded to the 4k 4 user package. It's not piracy either, I'm not recording or distributing the content. If Netflix wants to dick with me I'll dick with them. I never said this was permanent but I vote with my wallet. Vote cast. I also haven't used Netflix once since that day despite being able to. I've been using Amazon and Microsoft video where I own over 500 movies so you can stuff the whole theft argument. I've bought more content than most and that doesn't include my DVD, Blu-ray, and uhd Blu-ray collection which is well over 1400 movies and TV shows at this point. Your right...I've been rooting since the first Android phone but I totally don't understand the possibilities. My argument is simple. The overwhelming majority of root users don't mess with apps. To hell with that nonsense argument anyways. What is the danger to Netflix? Copying movies? Please...it's a million times easier to do it on a PC. Even windows xp can handle it without issue. Does Netflix and you I suppose really think root users are using the app to steal content? If so how? Show me one forum topic, one article, one modified Netflix apk that allows downloading and bypassing their drm. I'm begging you. Just 1. BAlGaInTl I reviewed the Netflix TOS, and I will agree that you are not stealing. I'll even remove the verbiage from my post. Netflix does not make any such stipulation. They speak only of the "Account Owner" and "Devices." I guess I just assumed that, and that's my bad. As I've said in other posts... It isn't all about Netflix. A large part of it is about their content. They really can't argue that point with providers. You either play by their rules, work to establish new rules, or choose not to carry them. Netflix wants to stay relevant on all platforms. That's the main danger to Netflix. In addition, I shouldn't have to give an example in the wild of an exploit. Just because it is difficult to find doesn't mean it doesn't exist. What if someone else writes an app that uses root to mine user account data from Netflix? Should Netflix not be worried about protecting user data? If that happens, who is responsible for the security and the bad press? Probably not Netflix, but they would certainly be impacted. I checked my app really quick (which is stuck on version 4 because I'm affected). Since Netflix keeps you logged in for convenience (that's spelled out in their terms), a quick look gives my full name, username, phone number, zip code, the brand of payment card, and the last 4 digits of that card. That's quite a bit of information that can easily be gathered by a piece of Malware. Now as I said... Netflix probably wouldn't be liable if a user was compromised because of root. It would certainly be a danger to their business however. Why should the be asked to take that risk? It seems to me that they are approaching this in a realistic manner, and rolling it out in a reasonable way. Would this affect the majority of root users? Probably not. By their nature, root users will find ways around it anyway. The problem is that the impact to Netflix from losing content and/or a compromised app is disproportionate the loss of blocking root users. It's simply a numbers game, and you can't blame Netflix for that. And you certainly can't blame Google who is trying to improve security. username_not_valid Thats not for me to decide, or argue, the fact is the content providers have decided that rooting is a risk to their copyrighted content, and as such services like Netflix, Amazon, and other streaming services must comply and lock out rooted devices. Passing safetynet and using Googles DRM framework is the easiest way to claim due diligence, so thats what they will do, and in order to keep Android competitive Google is providing the tools needed to make it possible. What I will argue though is that your notion that custom ROMs etc are more secure is unfounded. The best might well be, but there are hundreds of completely random and unchecked ROMs out there that could contain absolutely anything, you cant possibly claim that custom ROMs are inherently safer or more secure than OEM ROMs, outdated or not. jonzey231 So let's play this out: If someone takes the Netflix .apk and mods it with malware and then signs it, it will pass installation on the device. 1. User opens app. 2. App does whatever shitty thing it's designed to do while the user thinks they just got around the block. 3. The OS scans the app and warns the user it's been modified and they should uninstall it. 4. User thinks "Ha! I know and that's why it works!" 5. User keeps app until they get a call from Credit Karma that their identity was probably stolen but they don't know how. 6. Person spends 6 months fixing stolen identity. But still uses that app the whole time. Ultimately, that user is still going to be screwed. Would you or I make this mistake? No. Would your cousin's friend's dad because he had his son root so he could tether for free and overheard you guys talking about sideloading apps and googled how to do it? Yes. Randroid Problem is, even in your scenario, root has nothing to do with it. Someone who is not rooted could do the same thing. The only problem is, now MORE people who root are going to be *forced* to look for a modified apk because the official apk is not available from the Play Store. So in the end, it's causing more problems than it's fixing. Corbin Baxter Here's the thing about rooting: when you alter your devices software like that, then Google shouldn't be responsible for anything that comes afterwards for the user. This just helps discourage rooting, which can alter a new users perspective on Android, or make someone reconsider getting an Android device. someone755 For what it's worth, back in 2011/2010, many of us bought into Android *because* we could root. Imagine the possibilities of being in control of so much more of your system than with any mobile OS prior; We've spent hundreds (some, thousands) of dollars in this environment, on devices, apps, books etc. I understand this isn't how things stand nowadays, but root is still prevalent because of one issue that Google will not fix (or at least, won't until O+ is running on the majority of devices, but that'll take two years at the minimum), and those are updates and vendor apps (i.e. bloatware). If my phone is stuck on Lollipop I'm going to root it; I'll be able to mitigate the memory leak performance drops, and overall customize the device to fit my specific needs -- I've made quite a few friends (think ROM and kernel devs) because I just wanted to put a thermal engine better than Qualcomm's horrendous MPDecision into the kernel directly (i.e. I took the kernel source and modified it to fit my needs). What Google is trying to do here is, yes, discourage rooting, but instead of fixing the root cause (heh) behind why people root in the first place (that is, again, customizability and personal(ized) performance tuning, in large part to keep devices on older Android versions alive), root wouldn't be necessary. In the long run this *might* fix the symptom, but it most definitely will not help in fixing the cause. And that's because the cause is Google itself. As if apps like Snapchat blocking power users from their apps wasn't enough, now there's this -- If it becomes so common that even Google's own apps start to utilize the feature, I'll be gone to another mobile platform within a month. That might mean iOS, it might mean S60v3, I'll know that if (or rather, when) it happens. tl;dr: Google is putting a band-aid on a shotgun wound. Corbin Baxter I'm speaking mainly for new Android users. They don't feel as comfortable rooting. Doing this makes Android SEEM more like iOS. This doesn't MAKE Android like iOS. New users are comfortable with that. This is the same issue Microsoft had with Windows 8/8.1. Classic users, and Windows enthusiasts, hated someone changing the way they would use their computers. Microsoft introduced a different way of doing things, and to enthusiasts, it was bad, no matter how good it might be. Google's Project Treble should mostly fix the fragmentation problem, therefore giving Android users one less reason to root. To us enthusiasts, nothing can beat rooting, but it might not be the best solution to the problems Android has. Google seems intent on fixing the problems rooting tries to solve, but in a higher-quality and reliable way. No hard feelings😉 trparky They won't understand that, they're too blinded by their geek rose colored glasses. Corbin Baxter I don't expect everyone to understand, but I'll be happy if even a small handful understand what Google is doing here. Dmitri Smirnov > when you alter your devices software like that, then Google shouldn't be responsible for anything that comes afterwards for the user. As if right now Google or the OEMs are in any ways responsible for the malware or unpatched firmware vulnerabilities that stay this way for year. But yes, the users that root are the problem. Corbin Baxter For unrooted phones, yes Google and OEMs are very responsible. But after you root, Android loses most of its security and stability, and rooting is basically tinkering with core system files. Google doesn't have any control over what the user can or can't do after that. bekifft That wasn't even a devil's advocate, that was a straight up strawman. Frosted Butts Yes.. please tell me about all the Netflix alternatives i can install, that can legally stream from Netflix...... Right now, if i am rooted and want Netflix (a service i am paying for), i must go through 3rd party app stores to install the APK. There is no choice at all... R Firestone ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ Umm you have the choice to unroot your device. Maxr1998 ..which is a bad choice for many. d0x360 Yes you do except I rooted my device to make it MORE secure. Unrooting would make my device less secure than sideloading apps would. username_not_valid People can keep saying that, but the content providers have no way to know whether or not you have taken measures to secure your custom device, whereas if they go down this root they know its handled. BAlGaInTl "whereas if they go down this root they know its handled" I see what you did there. 😆😄 ...or just watch Netflix from Chrome! You could even do this from a Linux box with root! 😃 Suicide_Note Sure there is: unroot. Problem solved. neoKushan "I've solved this problem by creating 3 more problems - but it IS solved!" Eric Braun https://www.amazon.com/Netflix-Inc/dp/B005ZXWMUS Option C .. ?? h4rr4r A choice that is now more popular. dcdttu It's not so much about what a user chooses to do. It's about probability. The probability that sites are going to try to lure users into downloading malware-infected Netflix APKs from 3rd party sites is going to go up if you can't download it from a safe source in the first place. This is just like the fact that, if you don't give drug users a safe and clean place to shoot up, they're going to go do it somewhere else that's much more dangerous. Both of these scenarios are bad for society in general, no matter what the original intention was. kgptzac 1/10. Gotta try harder. Premsuraj How? Google Play Protect will still catch malicious apps makapav Yes but you're potentially making people venture through shady sites to get the APKs. Eric Braun Or to Amazons App store or Fdroid. The people going to shady sites are already going there, this isn't going to increase the traffic by any real amount. tehboogieman Are you sure that Google will continue allowing GPP for unlocked or rooted users going forward? Not to mention that it's not a silver bullet for 0days d0x360 It barely works as is. There are tons of apps that slip through every day. Krebs on security reports on them quite frequently. I don't trust Google's scanning of apps at all which is why I root. I can make my phone more secure and I can also image the device as often as I want so if something does happen it's fixed within 5 min. If I unroot then I lose the protection along with the backups. Premsuraj Custom ROMs and root can't protect from 0days either. And just out of curiosity how is root going to provide more security? If anything it makes the device less secure tehboogieman Nobody said root makes a device more secure. Blocking root users from downloading apps from the Play Store puts users at more risk since those users will be more inclined to sideload apps from sources that might not be as reliable as the Play Store. Premsuraj The only people who cares about this are the people who root. And those user's generally tend to be more knowledgeable about what kind of apps and app stores they can trust. ASYOUTHIA✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ And only <2% of users will do this to keep rooted. xxTheGoDxx Only the plus 50 - 100 Million users that have root: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=eu.chainfire.supersu ASYOUTHIA✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ You do realize that that's just downloads right? ...not active users. blindexecutioner I'm not mad. I continue to use things like magisk to help get around stuff like this. All this will do is encourage me to use unauthorized sources for offending apps if magisk ever stops working. There is a reason I use Android over iOS and it certainly isn't because the apps are better designed or whatever. brian. Magisk is a good way around this. However, I don't know how long this will last. I would think with security in mind and developers trying to monetize more, it will put pressure on Google to make SafetyNet get triggered much easier. Obviously, I don't have any way of knowing, but this could easily turn into a cat and mouse game more than it already is. Android Pay was first, other apps did it like Super Mario Run, which who cares, but now Netflix? Changes are coming, and it doesn't look good for the rooting community. D13H4RD2L1V3 I'm not sure if everyone gets why some of us went through the trouble of gaining SU access. Sure, maybe there's a few who went through all that trouble for nefarious purposes (and maybe that got regulatory bodies concerned to the point where Google even needed to consider this) but from my perspective at least, a lot of us gain Superuser access mainly to get features that we liked on other Android flavors, especially in the case of a build of Android that's very close to Google's vision. Such as the ability to hide the navbar at any time we wanted and also to gain theming support (which I feel should be added officially sooner rather than later because I absolutely hate how Google is making their already-bright UI even more eye-searing with even more white-colored elements, which also makes the benefits of OLED much less obvious). I wouldn't be as concerned if these features were pushed to AOSP soon, but as it stands, I feel that Google should probably think about making these features available soon. Marty Thank the bad apples for why you no longer have freedom. Jeremy ディリマ Would changing region firmware with Odin flag the SafetyNet check on Samsung mobiles? Soz if it's a stupid question a lot has changed since I last fiddled with Android Christopher Robert This was a long time coming. Once root user started using root to pirate software, and/or get around geo locks, instead of using it to add feature to their firmware or improve their devices performance, it was only a matter of time before it all got torn down. h4rr4r Get around geo locks? You mean have my device report the location I want it to report? Yeah, how terrible that I control what my computer does. dizel123 You still do. This doesn't affect that at all h4rr4r You said the justification for that was people using their devices for their own reasons in the way they liked. I was pointing out that this is a normal thing and not something that should be punished. Cuvis You don't need root to pirate. You never did. Marty Apple says, Thank you. h4rr4r Sounds like we need a new FREE platform. Maybe Amazon can use this to push their store. mxwp but will the Netflix from the Amazon App Store work on rooted phones? Curt RIP Root. I'm not moving from stock anymore, just cab with the hassle. Until there's a 'reliable' way to hide from Safety Net, I'll enjoy my Android Pay, banking apps and overall smoothness. (If it was up to me, I'd be rooted with Linage) h4rr4r IOS is the platform for you. That was the deal from the beginning. hp-fourtwenty magisk....giyf .y phone is rooted with lineage 14.1, and passes safetynet. problem solved! jcopernicus Fantastic news. Lawstorant All this butthurt for what? You all sound like Magisk doesn't exist. Dave Hamilton Lets take Apple and there closed source. Lets take Google and there open source, the freedom to do and change as you please to make the device yours. No two devices have to be the same. Lets get 115 million android users, and then start deciding you no longer have this choice and freedom to do what you want! When something gets better and better, its only a matter of time before all the things you love are removed and comersilised Eric Braun You still have the option to do what you want. However like everything there are reactions for every action. Want to root or unlock your device? Sure, however there may be a few apps that no longer appear in the playstore. May want to have a backup like Amazon App Store or something similar ready. No one is stopping you, feel free to do as you please. tehboogieman Man, if I have to choose between having a device with root or a device with apps that use day to day, the iPhone goes from a 1% chance of being my daily driver to about 50% There are still a lot that can Android can do that iOS can't, but if I'm living in a walled garden the iPhone is looking pretty attractive. 5+ years of official OS support, solid retail network for quick service or hardware exchanges. The Play Store is my main source of apps that I know are vetted and generally safe. I have no desire to manage app updates manually. There is always a chance that someone will build and maintain an appstore that will have all root blocked apps (maybe the future of APKMirror?). If not it might be the death of Android for users like me Eric Braun Even without all of this I would use an APKMirror App that allowed for updating of apps automatically. dizel123 Google gives app developers more control over their apps. Whiny entitled internet crybabies go on the internet and whine and cry. Aka...Thursday neoKushan Alternatively: Google restricts users from using their device, which they own, how they see fit. dizel123 Except Google isn't restricting anyone from doing anything. But being 100% wrong has never stopped anyone in the internet NubCake being an asshole (in your case) hasn't stopped anyone from commenting eather it seems. dizel123 I can admit to being an asshole. But I'm also right so it's all good. neoKushan It's certainly not stopping you. dizel123 I haven't experienced it so of course it's not stopping me trparky You may own the hardware but you don't own the software, you only have a license to use it. Csöpi Thats so greate. I have a stock oneplus one and for some strange reasons i was failing the test beforhand, but now its all green. Still cant update the netflix app hence chromecast isnt working either anymore. Not really happy. JC If there's a will there's a way. brian. If more developers get on board with this, I can't see why I would switch to Android. I've always been curious about new Android phones, bought a bunch and rooted them all if I could. This is not good for a person like me. d0x360 If Google keeps this up and app devs include the api to block rooted phones then my days using Android will be over and Google will have lost a user who's been there since the g1. I don't know what I'd switch to... probably windows mobile because I'm not a fan of apple whatsoever. It's really a shame because if I had to guess I'd say 99.99% of people who root do so for either the added security and or customized experiences. For example I use root to modify my status bar and quick panel as well as firewall my apps and use adaway and yes Google I do whitelist sites that aren't obnoxious with their ads. John Doe All the more reason for the APK mirror appstore LoL Jan-Lk Else Yeah Google want's us to buy tooooo expensive phones to just get the latest Android, because cheap phones suck at updates and so they need to be flashed and rooted... trparky But if the community raises holy hell with the OEMs then maybe it will be corrected. There's no damn reason why a three year old device can't be updated when an eight year old Windows 7 machine is still receiving Windows Updates. McStagger WHY DOES NETFLIX CARE IF THE PHONE IS ROOTED?!?!?!?! mxwp Netflix does not care, but the content creators that make the stuff you see on Netflix do care. They care because they are idiots who think it is easier to pirate from rooted phones. bekifft Again, Google becomes more and more restrictive. I switched from iPhone because the screens were too small, and Google was far less restrictive. Both of those issues are now resolved, and Google's upped the price of their device to match Apple. May as well switch back to iPhone, Google seems to support it just as much as Android anyway. Luxferro Except it's not just rooted users! Any device with an unlocked bootloader. hp-fourtwenty Your comment sucks for misinforming users about what safetynet is....has NOTHING to do with unlocked bootloaders. Luxferro Sure it does. My Nexus 6P only has an unlocked bootloader, and Netflix disappeared from the play store after the last update. And I'm not the only one, so I suggest you do some reading. TechGuy22 more reason for me to pirate hey, have at it Matías Duarte I hope Netflix does the same with Jailbroken iOS devices. Why they do this btw? To prevent people recording their movies? You can do that with Windows.. Knowledgeborn Allah In all honesty, that'll probably never happen. Jailbreaking iOS opens the doors to a lot of customization on an iPhone, but the security issues are often minimal (with the exception being not having the latest software version). Jailbreaking is pretty much filtered through the Cydia platform. You don't have access to the entire system with a jailbreak. Rooting is completely different, because you can completely reshape the core OS. fbl Note : I don't work for Netflix so I can't comment for them. Possible causes : - the right holders might be pushing for this. I work on roughly the same product area and we don't implement DRM because we like them, we implement them because we contractually have to. -Netflix is tired of getting low notes because of crashes coming by shitty hacks in custom roms. Zach Mauch Anyone know how chromebooks will be affected by this? Will dev mode being enabled cause you to fail SafetyNet Checks? That is currently the only way to install apks on Chromebooks. Branko But Android AOSP!11 -Google 2011 How the times how changed. Wayne Randall ALT arguement, because I don't have time to read every comment... This doesn't limit me and my rooted N6P at all, this move limits how much money they (the devs and Google) are going to make. I can't buy it (the app or coins, or special characters, or bonus content, w/e) if I can't see it. Plain and simple. The important apps will still be there. No app is worth unroot. Block Project Fi from root though... weeeellll. I guess I'd unroot for that. mxwp yeah, only Netflix, banks, and big names will use these blocks. i am guessing most devs want as much exposure as possible. PVL_93_RU Google is actively trying to kill the modding community. Not the Custom ROM makers, but people who root and install Xposed. All because they compromise the security for Android Pay I fear the day root and Xposed apps start disappearing from the Play Store trparky If it comes to security vs being open, security will always win (or at least should always win). Eric Koop I had my Shaw Gateway app update yesterday and they changed it so it doesn't work if rooted. So I had to uninstall and find an APK online of an older version. Now it's just a matter of time before I forget and re-install the update. What a pain... disqus_em5YfkbWdk Well this would certainly get me to cancel Netflix. My personal Plex server is far better than Netflix could ever be anyway. Vivek Rameses Becoming apple more and more every day. Disgusting. Knowledgeborn Allah Android is starting to look more and more like iOS with each update... ¯_(ツ)_/¯ trparky Open platforms rarely stay open once the Benjamins start rolling in. hp-fourtwenty Go ahead and block me...I'll just pirate your app. Play nice and so will I. Start poking me and I'll poke back by never giving you another penny. App devs can't beat XDA devs. It's not going to happen. My unlocked, rooted, rommed and modded device still passes safety net. The day that stops, so does the flow of money leaving my hands on the play store. Luxferro Lay off the sodas.... UniBroW Question, can those of you without access to Netflix on Google play, can it be installed from the Amazon App Store? Stanley C. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/dd381b7e8a39df74c4725712a0db906098c965e9ee4194b6e01e020fd69ee566.png Thats how magisk is made... Magic! Marti Abernathey Yawn. I've got a rooted device and just installed Netflix... because? Magisk. As soon as they made this choice I cancelled. Not because I can't get around it, but because they make me do that. mrjayviper even on a non-rooted LOS mis 5s+, I cannot install Netflix. unlocking the bootloader already tripped safety. And I don't want to root. The features available in non-rooted LOS is enough for me. Teh BuG No. Bueno. TedPhillips Sigh. What's the over-under on this becoming pervasive in the play store... MicroG / Fdroid I'm coming soon. World needs a solid single alternative gcm replacement to catch on. TedPhillips As far as the potential for support overhead, being rooted is generally less than the pain coming from the Xposed/magisk crowd. You need to be actively interfering with an app via root vs code being injected into low levels of the framework that everything uses. TedPhillips I think the best outcome could be that Google opens up their process for little guys to certify there own rom builds, ala let's encrypt lowering friction on getting ssl setup. AOSP should not be a functionally useless base implementation for I'm roms, but something you can use in​ practice. TedPhillips Hey guys, don't worry. Google says Android is for everyone. https://www.android.com/everyone/ That includes AOSP developers too, right? That website seems to tread the line pretty carefully, ala 'no one is forcing you use Google play' but Hiroshi's quote seems like it comes with a grain of salt since he owns Play. I'd love to see AP interview him about this. qkjDlav As an app developer for a large app used globally, the two biggest time wasters in a developer's life are a) debugging device specific issues (HTC, Samsung, etc) and b) crash logs with Xposed in the stack trace. Developers are tired of having to sit around with device farms at their desks just to make sure new features and changes work with each quirky variant of Android that manufacturers want to deploy, and custom roms do make it worse. Enthusiasts are welcome to customize their own versions of Android and sideload apps, but we don't want to see crashlogs in the Developer Console from rooted/custom ROM users. And companies probably don't want to keep paying us to debug issues that only a small minority of users will see. Lê Nguyên Chương Most stupid thing I've ever heard in my life.

Sign up to follow, and we’ll e-mail you free updates as they’re published. You’ll receive free e-mail news updates each time a new story is published. You’re all set! Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Hayley Tsukayama By Hayley Tsukayama May 19 at 1:43 PM Follow @htsuka (Courtesy of Google) If you use Google's Gmail app, you may have seen something new pop up on your screen this week: suggested responses for your emails. The move illustrates one way that Google is using its increased focus on artificial intelligence and machine learning. If you're wondering why and how Google can make these suggestions, here are some answers about the feature and how it works. What’s going on? Google calls the feature Smart Reply, and it’s pretty much what it sounds like. Google algorithms are scanning your messages and using the information it gleans to suggest ways that you could reply to any given message. The feature is based off an idea from Gmail engineer Bálint Miklós, Google said in a 2015 blog post. Miklós asked the Google Research team if there was any way to create some tappable template replies in Gmail. There are, after all, plenty of emails to which one could respond with just a “Got it,” “Thanks,” or “See you soon!” Having some pre-made responses at one’s fingertips would save everyone a little more time, Miklós thought. Why am I seeing this now? Google users have had access to this feature since 2015, but only in Google’s smaller and more experimental Inbox app. And the suggestions offered by the feature have been getting steadily more advanced as it’s learned from the decisions of more customers. Based on that success, Google has decided it was ready for more general use. How does it work? Smart Reply relies on machine learning to scan the subject line and body of an email and make suggestions based on what it sees. The company said it has built up a huge bank of anonymized customer messages and response decisions to help accomplish this. It is also designed to remember your individual preferences for things, such as punctuation. So it will be able to adjust its suggestions depending on whether you're a “Thanks!” or “Thanks.” type of person. Smart Replies won't appear on every email though, Google said. You're most likely to see response suggestions on emails that can be easily answered with a simple sentence or two. So ... is someone at Google reading my email? There is no person at Google reading your email, according to Google. Even when research scientists were building the feature and trying to suss out which responses matched which messages, they designed their testing to make sure that no person ever read a Gmail user’s email. But it does mean that Google's software is scanning your messages, much in the same way that its spell-checkers and spam filters do right now. Google anonymizes all the data from these tools, but the fact that your messages are being scanned is still worth noting. Can I turn if off? Yes. You are able to turn off Smart Reply through your settings menu. How well does it work? Smart Reply suggestions have been getting steadily better as the feature has matured and learned from users’ decisions. But it’s still not perfect. Language, after all, is a complicated thing. Google researchers Brian Strope and Ray Kurzweil wrote about how difficult it is to parse the sentence, “That interesting person at the cafe we like gave me a glance,” in a blog post this week. “In proposing an appropriate response to this message we might consider the meaning of the word “glance,” which is potentially ambiguous. Was it a positive gesture? In that case, we might respond, “Cool!” Or was it a negative gesture? If so, does the subject say anything about how the writer felt about the negative exchange? A lot of information about the world, and an ability to make reasoned judgments, are needed to make subtle distinctions.” Plus, our emails, particularly from mobile devices, tend to be riddled with idioms that make no actual sense. Things change depending on context: Something “wicked” could be good or very bad, for example. Not to mention, sarcasm is a thing. Which is all to warn you that you may still get a wildly random and even potentially inappropriate suggestion — I once got an “Oh no!” suggestion to a friend’s self-deprecating pregnancy announcement, for example. If the email only calls for a one- or two-sentence response, you’ll probably find Smart Reply useful. If it requires any nuance, though, it’s still best to use your own human judgment. business technology the-switch true Please provide a valid email address. Sign up You’re all set!

Google Allo hit 5 million downloads in 5 days - two months later, its momentum seems utterly stalled David Ruddock Follow View All Posts 2016/11/29 2:22pm PDTNov 29, 2016 106 Plus 1 on G+ 310 Share on Facebook 96 Share on Twitter Total Shares512 Applications Editorials News On September 28th, almost two months ago to the day, Allo co-lead Justin Uberti announced the app had achieved a staggering five-million downloads in just five days since its launch. It was impressive, though not exactly unexpected for a major Google app debut. Now, once at the top of the Play Store's app rankings, Allo sits below position #200, and shows few signs of momentum. The app's download count remains at the 5,000,000-10,000,000 milestone it achieved back at the end of September, meaning that in over sixty days Allo has not managed to achieve again what it did in the first five it was available. That's not great news. Its sister product, video chat app Duo, has done considerably better: Duo has generally stabilized around the #100-150 ranking on the Play Store and broke past the 10,000,000 download mark (it has, however, been available longer). As of this writing, it sits over 70 positions above Allo on the overall Play Store top chart - #129 to Allo's #201. On iOS, the picture is grimmer yet: Allo was last updated on the App Store around 2 weeks ago, in that time, it has received 13 new user ratings. Not 1300, not 130: thirteen. (To be fair, Google Duo isn't fairing a whole lot better there.) It has nearly 500 iOS ratings total, compared to well over 150,000 ratings on the Play Store. That would seem to make the multi-platform aspect of Allo's launch little more than symbolic - a commitment to a group of users that essentially doesn't exist. Google Allo 2.0 was released at the end of last month with some sorely-needed features. Unfortunately, none of them seem to solve its intrinsic problems: a complete lack of multi-device support, no message backup, no support for alternate protocols like SMS or RCS, and no web or desktop client. This does follow in the model of some services like WhatsApp, but those have achieved the critical mass of users that makes foregoing certain features bearable. Allo does not have the luxury of dominance, even as Google goes as far as to advertise it on sacred ground: the search homepage. There are those that say, once RCS messaging gets off and running, integration into Allo could make the app the go-to platform users had hoped it would be out of the gate (Hangouts SMS déjà vu, anyone?). Oh, and also a web client. That's a must. And multi-device support, certainly we're not giving up Hangouts without it, right? And cross-sync and backup - we need that. An easy way to video or voice chat would be handy, too. And so, slowly but surely, it seems we're starting to just tell Google to build Hangouts all over again, something the Allo team must be absolutely loathe to do given that much of Allo's purpose seems to be to free Google of what it considers Hangouts' vestigial feature baggage. That makes the question of what's to be done with Allo not just one of responding to user demand, but of basic product philosophy: can Allo, a product that seems a true believer in its mobile-first zeal, be contorted into something more extensible, powerful, and flexible? And in doing so, will Google only see more users flee to platform-agnostic messaging services to escape the confusion? Allo may have only been with us a couple of months, but that short time could hardly be imagined to have gone worse for the nascent messaging app, and Google has provided precious little indication that Allo's shortcomings - which often seemed framed as features - are going away any time soon.

Google should have really separated itself and created ONE app that does it all. makapav It's called Hangouts. They just need to throw a team on it with a brain unlike Justin Uberti. Howard Stern ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I second, third and fourth this!! Duder12 Justin has been doing pretty good well. It may not have been his decision to split off into Allo. makapav It may not have been his decision but he still needed to publicly ask people 'what they'd like to see improved in Allo'. People should have been like GTFO and spend an hour on the Allo reddit thread to know what his future roadmap for it should. That didn't need more than half a bit of brain to figure out and that's why he has no credibility in my books. HSidhu +1000 why they are using the same product manager for same kind of product... what different will he do this time? Uberti sucks. bekifft Google has plenty of brains, it seems much more like politics at this point. Same thing that held Microsoft back for so long, they have Not Invented Here syndrome within their own company. Ian Bradley Allo doesn't need to do it all, it just needs to do more, and do that subset of features better than Hangouts did Howard Stern ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ i disagree. I think it needed to do WAY more. but to do the same thing everyone else is doing is where it failed. it needed to do more. its just my opinion obviously, we all have them and I respect yours. :) _jack_ The simplicity of Duo would be a perfect addition to any messenger app. Just add a "call" button, that's it. WhatsApp solved that pretty neat imho. If I don't want to use the (video) calling, I just ignore it. MJ I am not saying they shouldn't but adding Duo whould do almost nothing to help Allo.... Most people don't do video calls but they all message people which you really can't do with Allo which ironically is supposed to be it's purpose. Howard Stern ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ good point....i just think doing the same as apple did not favors to anyone. google hasnt really separated themselves from the pack in this regard. I think they need to focus on one app....make it their baby. they have more apps than android phones. /s Gusie I think the way they really screwed up was not doing SMS normally. At least Whatsapp doesn't even claim to do SMS. Allo does do SMS, but does it in a really screwy way. And I'm not sure everyone wants some AI thing digging through their conversations, etc. Kinda like, some random person sleeping on your couch, making food from your fridge, swearing they are going to do some housework to help out. Howard Stern ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ agreed, thats why i think we all know why. no default sms support....that would have made this the "it factor" in my book. I will stick to and love textra in the mean time. Gusie One of the big reasons I thought I'd give Allo a try was for the incognito mode (using Signal encryption protocol). Since Allo was such a screw-up, I just keep using Signal for SMS and encrypted messaging. eddiepearson cept facetime and imessage are two different apps. However, work together. Corbin Davenport I can't wait for Google's next messenger app in 6-12 months. Artem Russakovskii Google Annuo. Jasdeep Singh Google Solo. K77bkny Google "Um I don't know" ¯_(ツ)_/¯ alexz Google Dunno Avishek Google Namaste , Google Hola, Google EiE (Enough is Enough) people better be use our messengers or we will spread SKYNET (even before 2029) on your Mobile :P mondeca This is how I feel about Google's physical products, too. OnHub is on the way out, now that there's Wifi. Nexus had a great run, but now there's Pixel. What if I buy a Wifi or a Pixel, and there's something else next year? drksilenc Wifi is fully comp with the onhub... makapav That's not the fucking point. It sold for $200 a month ago and now it's value is $129? WTF? Not to mention they ditched all the hyped potential on those devices which was used to justify the price tag. Basically, assholery was in full effect. Jasdeep Singh it's value is 89 bucks! Aaron Bought one anyway. bekifft Apple gets away with it all the time. This is their justification. Often if the price changes within 30 days of purchase the buyer can get a partial refund but most don't bother, or know better. Marcellus1 Supposedly Andromeda is coming out next year and may replace Android. It's anyone's guess whether any current hardware will support Andromeda. MicroNix That's just it. Next year. Next year we'll get a better messenger. The next version will be the one. The next version will get it right. I think it is overwhelming safe to say Google will NEVER get messaging right. bobEveryman Why do I feel like you could substitute Cleveland Browns for Google in your post and still make a good point? mola2alex Rebranding Android would be the dumbest thing Google could ever do, yet I wouldn't put it past them. Somehow I think they think they are being smart and googley by doing this sort of shit hzd I don't see Andromeda being much cop either, chromeOS has it biggest issue of poor to non existent great viable alternative apps to most other popular platforms ( win / osx / Linux ) and with cobbled together android app support but far fewer optimised for chromeOS apps it's pretty wishy washy. Andromeda will have huge boots to fill and should at least support high end Chromebooks those with Intel chip sets with more than 2gigs of ram from the last two years, also it should have far far far far better word party application support ( if it runs on Linux / Android there should be little reason for it not to work with Andromeda no matter the input method ) This won't happen, it's totally going to be gimped out the gate and ship with silly expensive hardware and likely won't support even Google's own Pixel devices. . . Midnitte Tbf, they said OnHub with use the Google Wifi app and be compatible with the Wifi's mesh networks. Now if only Allo was compatible with hangouts (or SMS)... Carson Saldanha I get what you're saying, but I feel Wifi and Pixel are for the long term. Andrew Wang *cough* 6 years *cough* Carson Saldanha Hahahaha wicketr Google has developed an extremely bad name for themselves, even among the Google fans. They are known to halfway build something and abandon it just as quick. People/fans are scared to buy a product from them because it likely won't receive long term support or enhancements. And ecosystems are even worse because they take serious long term investment and time, and with Google having the attention span of a 4yr old, is an absolute nightmare. Google needs to fix their image and fast, and it comes down to leadership. It's seriously lacking as the direction seems all over the place with no commitment to anything. Ryan Joseph Yep, that's why I'm very wary of Google Home. Some people are already selling their Echos in hopes of Home's hype and potential. I don't trust Google AT ALL to deliver on that potential, and that's sad. Thisismyusername1982 I was very weary as well, after getting one from best buy for $70 I love it. It has full control over the entire house via IFTTT and the maker channel talking to Home Assistant. Only thing I find myself wanting is to be able to push stuff to it, hopefully the API release next month will solve that. theProffer I went ahead and bought one, but only because I didn't have an Echo. TBH, though, Amazon is on thin ice as well. Not nearly as thin as Google, but after the whole Fire Phone, I am more skeptical of them than others (not a lot, but more). numpty "What if?" There *will* be something else next year, that's just the way technology goes. Buy the best thing you can afford that meets your needs now, and it will probably continue to do so for a few years regardless of anything different or better that comes along in the meantime. tekdemon Onhub actually started out as a really great idea, but ended up being watered down over time then got implemented as a really half-assed version of what it was originally supposed to be, at a really high price. If it actually hit the original vision it would have been an amazing success. Roger Siegenthaler Well they run their hardware just like they run their software, iterate and break stuff. Unfortunately that means they won't ever get any recuring revenue because none of their products stand the test of time. I mean, why do they think they're getting their asses handed to them on everything enterprise. Some Body No kidding. This kind of crap seems to only surprise Google and nobody else. hzd Google Ether ? Your enable to send any message format you like but it will just vanish into the cloud and never go out. 😆😄 But, but, but..... Allo has a Sloth sticker pack! https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/59bb90db762d0d083037996742807429c9d6e64a0b46b033a40b3e0dcdf4495e.png makapav BTW, what are the numbers for Spaces? For shits and giggles. And maybe that's app Justin is comparing Allo's performance against. Carson Saldanha 1mil - 5mil users Defenestratus Die Allo Die. lifelong890 Allo seems like a solid messaging app. I just wish more than 10 of my contacts had it. Most iPhone users in the US happily use iMessage and don't perceive any reason to use anything else since most of their contacts probably also have iPhones. Defenestratus I've said it before - for a company that seems to know what everyone on the internet wants through its search and marketing tools, Google is remarkably tone-deaf to its users. DirkBelig At the risk of sounding political, the ideological slant of pretty much all Googlers is one of feeling they know best and are thus charged to impose their enlightened views upon others and they should simply accept it because it is a gift handed down from the plebs' betters. So we get product after product that avoids simply copying what other, wildly more successful, products do in favor of something which doesn't even cover basic features and then they wonder why it didn't catch on. If Google made a remote control, it would only advance channels (so if you accidentally clicked past your desired channel, you'd have to press the button 500 times to loop around) and only increase volume, but would have a can opener attachment with a revolutionary permanently sharpened blade so you'll never struggle to open a can of soup in the living room while watching TV. keithzg A lot of it is just classic NIH Syndrome, the same sort of Not-Invented-Here blindness that for a long time blinded Microsoft (and arguably still does for the most part) and Apple until they finally gave up on their own OS and grabbed a BSD base. Google has a particularly bizarre relationship with this human and organizational failing, since sometimes they'll actually be fantastic at avoiding it; take a look under the hood at ChromeOS and see how well they avoided making extra work for themselves by just re-using standard Linux components! But other times it seems like they won't adopt a technology, technique, or UI idea purely because it's already out there and they're certain that not only can they do better, they even figure they have nothing to learn from others. theProffer Maybe. Of course, after that whole business with Oracle, Google may be gun-shy about doing stuff like that. Anders Nah, if Google built a remote control it would have a "change channel" button that would use machine learning to automatically choose the best channel for you. If that's not the channel you wanted, you can press it again to get a new best channel. It would also have an "auto volume" button. Of course, two years later the cloud service the remote uses would be cancelled. gambit07 Haha, THIS Đức Thành Sounds about right. I wouldn't mind that remote, actually, but it seems the world just wouldn't be ready for it yet. Just like always. Đức Thành Hanlon's Razor can be expressed in this way: "Don't assume bad intentions over neglect and misunderstanding." I think this also applies to Google's case. I don't think they ever really mean to appear superior or avoid copying others, they actually just want to give to the people the best of the best. A great many times now, Google have created products after products that were and are much too ahead of its time. They are surely good products, if not in terms of execution then at least in terms of ideas and ingenuity. Most of those failed and many ideas died because the people just weren't ready for them. I'm sure this frustrates Google to no end, too, and they must really just want to make something that works this time around. TL;DR it's the Curse of Knowledge at work, again. I think there are several possible solutions to this problem, but in order to solve it Google has to be made aware of it first. DirkBelig I prefer the other definition: "Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity," Google has enough car wrecks and faceplants on its CV to suggest that any successes have been more due to luck than ability. (Sort of like when the Detroit Lions finish over .500) When you try to follow Friendster, MySpace and Facebook and your big social media play is freaking Google+ and you so offend people by roping them into it that you have to carve off the useful parts like Photos to keep them from dying from the association with G+. Not that Google is alone in being so up their own arses that they genuinely can't see they're marching off the cliff. Microsoft's botching of the Xbox One launch will be taught in business schools forever as a prime example of losing the plot and ignoring EVERYONE screaming, "WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!? YOU'RE GOING TO BLOW YOURSELF UP WITH THAT ATTITUDE!!!" While they're scoring some wins now, it was three lost years because they fancied themselves being Apple and wanting to capriciously ram some new anti-consumer paradigm upon their customers. (Windows 8 UI, anyone? All they needed to do was add a "Classic Mode" which looked like Win7, but NOOOOOOOOO!!! They were going to make people cope with Charms and touch interfaces on non-touch computers. Morons!) Speaking of Apple, proclaiming your "courage" because you eliminated the headphone jack and screwed users into daisy-chained adapters and making people buy $40 dongles for their laptops isn't very nice. Lucky for them, Samsung's 2016 phones were quite literally the bomb. Đức Thành Believe me, I already considered the possibility you mentioned, and I concluded that Google definitely *has* the ability, they are simply not that competent yet. (Not denying that many of Google's successes are thanks to luck, but everyone should know by now that luck is one of the many important factors when it comes to success. And if anything, Google is probably the one company that has had the most bad luck out of all tech companies in the world, considering how much possibilities they has had to try out by themselves.) catalysto I feel like this is most obvious with their inane, schizophrenic branding. It's kind of hard to recommend a product or service when you can't even figure out what it's called. And if your service can't be verbed, you messed up. mola2alex Yeah, branding changes by the week. For example, Chromecast app became Google cast app which phased out Chromecast as a technology but more for the device. Then the app became Google home and products that previously supported Google cast now have 'Chromecast built in'. Like wtf. Linx Worst branding job...EVER! Tomáš Petrík "Chromecast Home with Google Cast" confirmed for Q1 2017. mola2alex Google checkout, wallet, Android pay Georgekanderson Google is paying 97$ per hour!

Johny Bravo google videos, youtube, youtube red Johny Bravo also WTF: google talk, hangouts, allo, duo, messenger mola2alex It was talk and Android messenger. Then simultaneously they launched g+ messenger and hangouts on the web. Then hangouts became all the above including sms. Then they came back out with a Google sms messenger and unmerged sms from hangouts and then launched duo and allo that now exist with hangouts and messenger. Given the track record, I think another merge is due which will then be split out into pieces... Johny Bravo nice analysis, you could work for google lol Haizum74 Exactly, ffs how many messenger type apps does one person really need when these could potentially be implemented into one app. mola2alex hangouts really has a lot of potential, add assistant, duo's knock knock (at least for 1 to 1 calls) and some RCS or carrier SMS integration as well as more formats available in threads like send files, voice clips etc would be killer Winston "Hangout me" "What?" Winston I usually give up at that point and use Skype. Giampi Do people still use Skype? erptastic unfortunately yes. Avishek Telegram For The Worth eddiepearson problem with telegram is well, again....getting friends and fam on it Avishek here we go again Catch 22 bekifft Ironically their very company name has been verbed for more than a decade. Something changed. I miss Eric Schmidt. b_boogey_xl but everyone is pretty much asking for Hangouts again... mondeca 1. Add Assistant to Hangouts. 2. Re-position Allo as the prime messenger for India, not for the rest of the world. 3. Re-position Hangouts as the prime messenger for the rest of the world. 4. Have a cookie. David Ruddock Nixon in a jar could be on to something bekifft This is such a great idea. And it would truly take someone like Nixon to power through the bureaucracy it would take to get this done. dblock Wish they had stats on how many of those 5 million uninstalled it after mere minutes of using it. David I'm one of them vn33 I'm among the ones who didn't even bother installing it in the first place. Suicide_Note I have Allo installed, but haven't used it in at least a month or more. Google should have made Allo their take on iMessage, and included Duo's functionality within, while simultaneously making it the default messaging app for Android starting with Nougat. Include a splash screen to explain the change to users, and - boom! - success. Or at the very least, a much larger installed user base. pfmiller I still have it installed just so I can check once in awhile if any more of my contacts are using it yet. Spoiler alert, they're not. PandaBread I'm one of those that uninstalled. No point it wasting phone memory when it does less than whatsapp which is the goto messaging app within my circle. I won't be able to pursuade anyone to use this redundant app. impu153 I still have it installed and there's only one person I use it to talk to, a stubborn chap who insists on not using WhatsApp for some goddamn reason. newtonfb I for one am one of the "ones thats says RCS/Sms fallback would solve the adoption problem" With that and a desktop/chrome extension client, there would be a ton of people jumping on. With no Rcs/sms fallback option you are limited to the number of people who have it, and without desktop option it limits people usage. Jesse There are a few things i dislike about Allo. First, encrypted / incogneto chats are assumed to not be your primary method of communicating. I don't want the assistant to suggest smart replies. I want encrypted communication. That doesn't mean what i'm talking about is a big secret and notifications must all be hidden. I want to see what the message says, and I want quick reply, and i want encryption. Second, you can't disable insecure chats. If I only want people to contact me with encrypted chats, I can't set that. Why? Third, I can't disable smart reply or the assistant generally. I never use smart replies, but it's possible I may accidentally select one. I don't want them at all. Finally, it needs google voice and SMS integration. And, really, a hangouts bridge of some sort. I can't be using hangouts for almost all of my chatting, then switching back to Allo (which treats me poorly for wanting encrypted chats) for the three people who have it. Honestly, i'm pretty close to just uninstalling it and forgetting it. It's almost no use. Suicide_Note Serious question: if you aren't discussing anything that's a big secret or big deal, why the super strong need/desirefor encrypted messages? Jesse Because it's good practice and because people should expect encryption for privacy and security. An IM app that doesn't make encryption easy and functional is an IM app that doesn't prioritize security. I've also had people ask me for my ssn on chats (for legitimate reasons) and unencrypted chats could expose personal details about you that could be used for social engineering. It's just a really bad idea to use unencrypted chats, especially with how inexpensively people can set up eavesdropping attacks. Besides, Why should I end up with an app that can't do quick reply because i want my communication encrypted? There's no reason for Google to make it difficult to use encryption but they're doing it intentionally. Carson Saldanha Agreed. Quick reply is a useless feature that results in the lack of end-to-end encryption. Google still could've built the Google assistant into Allo chats with end-to-end--simply, only let the assistant read the part it's asked. The rest can be encrypted. Suicide_Note Thanks for the reply. As i said, i was genuinely curious since I've never seen the need for encrypted chats in my personal use. You bring up some very good points though, and have given me some food for thought. pfmiller Allo's big "selling point" is its Google Assistant integration. That's completely incompatible with secure messaging. If you want secure messaging Allo is simply not for you. Jesse I haven't found the assistant useful personally and I'd rather turn it off. I like other aspects of Allo. I'm not looking for fully secure messaging. But I often run my phone on networks I don't control, such as AT&T's network (or any hardware masquerading as such) and insecure wifi. I do VPN for the latter. There's no reason to actively discourage encryption or good practice but that's what Google is doing with Allo. They could easily have an advanced mode that allowed users a little more granularity with respect to the security settings rather than ramming assistant down your throat like they did with Google plus. Christopher Just make Hangouts a damn iMessage clone and bake it into Android. Why is SMS fall back so hard for Google to understand? Defenestratus Because Google is full of idiotic millennials who naively think that they know what their users want. tlogank Or maybe Google knows more about their product limitations than some patronizing commentor who doesn't realize this is something Apple has a patent on and Google can't just steal it like you think they should. iFeign Well, if Apple's patent is so applicable, why hasn't Signal been sued into nonexistence? The Android app has SMS fallback, or is it different from how iMessage handles it? Suicide_Note Probably because Signal doesn't have the mountain of cash and market share that Google has. Defenestratus Allo already has SMS fallback but implemented in the most idiotic way possible. If Apple was going to sue them then they would have gotten on with it already. Plus Google isn't afraid of pushing the limits on Apple's patents clearly. Look at the damn pixel... Carson Saldanha Allo's fake SMS isn't even close to what true SMS fallback is. freshprince_87 Absolutely!!! Michael2011 When were they awarded this patent? Better be before TextSecure was released in 2010. Carson Saldanha I believe the reason why SMS fallback is so difficult for Android to incorporate, notably in the US, is because of iOS. Say for instance Hangouts did support SMS fallback and you send a Hangouts message to an iOS user. Well, that message would end up in their Hangouts app. However, if you send a SMS text to that same iOS user, that text would end up in their Messages app. Thus, creating a confusing conversation for the iOS user but making sense for the Android user. Christopher Why is it confusing? They received an SMS so they open it in their SMS app. If someone with iOS sends me an SMS, they see a green chat instead of a blue and I get it in Hangouts because that's my SMS app. My head doesn't explode because I don't get it in the same app they do. It's about creating a comparable ecosystem. I am all for Google creating comparable experiences across platforms, it's admirable, but when creating a comparable experience is at the cost of Android being held back, it's dumb. Carson Saldanha I get what you're saying. You just want Google to make a complete iMessage clone for Android and don't make it for iOS. I guess that'd work, but it'd be pretty useless here in the States where a lot of people use iPhones. Check out this Reddit post: https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/53uvvu/why_sms_fallback_isnt_the_holy_grail_you_all/ freshprince_87 But they're are a lot of android users in United States too. But they're are more iOS users in general in United States sadly speaking 😔 Carson Saldanha Exactly. Not saying that there's a small number of Android phones in the US; tbh, there's actually quite a few, namely a lot of Samsung's tho. But overall, iOS leads in the US, but Android is larger world-wide. keithzg iOS is actually smaller than the Android userbase even in the US; last I checked, for smartphones, Android is at about 53% and iOS is at about 43% (the remaining ~4% is the poor souls still clinging to Windows Phone or Blackberries). Now, that differs a LOT in regards to demographics, so I can see why a person would go "geez, everyone I know has an iPhone!" But in raw aggregate numbers, it isn't true even in the US, which has the highest iPhone usership of any smartphone market. Carson Saldanha That's interesting. Could you share the source? keithzg Here's the comscore January 2016 report: https://www.comscore.com/Insights/Rankings/comScore-Reports-January-2016-US-Smartphone-Subscriber-Market-Share Carson Saldanha Sadly Android's declining slowly :( SIGTRAP I'm shocked! /s Was anyone actually expecting anything else to happen? rumanuu76 Google obviously were. brkshr I installed it and haven't even used it once (for messaging). databoy2k Hangouts always pushed me away and seemed more like Skype than a messaging app. Allo offered a fresh start and an opportunity to be a simple sms-type platform. But yes - lack of cross-device sync, no SMS support for non-allo users, and no good Android Wear compatibility keeps me for one just using Messenger to text people. Not to mention a stupid name that has had my fingers autocorrecting me to type allow each time I tried to write this post... I don't think it's a complicated feature set that we were looking for. We were looking for the death of Hangouts and Messenger in place of Allo/Duo, separation of the two so that we could easily communicate in a particular way with each app, and the better user-pointed features of Hangouts recreated with a modern take on messaging. They've chosen not to do this, for whatever reason, and now Allo is dying a slow death. Sad. Jason Pagliaro I just reinstalled Allo today to see if it would work with IFTTT for voice commands for Google Assistant. It doesn't. Will have to stick with Google Home. catalysto That's another huge problem: The Assistant in Allo does not work the same as the Assistant in Home. That's pretty bad. MasterDoughBoy Yes, Assistant is as fragmented as Android itself. Very frustrating. psy spy For the love of god google, please add/integrate everything into hangouts. We don't need 10 diff apps to do similar stuff. MHO, this is how messages should work in hangouts. 1) If you message someone in your contact list, if they don't have hangouts installed, send sms by default. 2) Require that each hangout account be associated with a phone number. just like allo, whatsapp. However, allow it to be accessed from the web. Phone number should be required only when registering an account. 3) If your contact has hangouts installed, send messages through the internet, by default. 4) Integrate duo into hangouts. Hangouts video sucks when you have poor connection. Skype kicks its ass. Duo is much better than hangout video. 5) World domination. Defenestratus You could never get a job at Google. You have a product vision that makes sense. Duder12 Apple has a patent on the SMS fallback so your list is impossible. bozzykid Also uses sms fallback already. Michael2011 No not really. It's not a proper SMS fallback like iMessage or Signal. bozzykid Yes, but if the issue was some sort of patent, that seems unlikely as they are already doing it. Michael2011 I don't think it's a patent issue... Just incompetence. blenderboy Do you mean this patent? belongs to google anyway. https://www.google.com/patents/US20150019659 wjbeckett Google filed a patent in 2012 for a system similar to iMessage. https://www.google.com/patents/US20150019659?branch_used=true Also, Allo already does SMS fallback - kinda. It knows which of your contacts have Allo installed and will send an SMS to those that don't. It just doesn't work as we expect it to. Blomsternisse Doesn't seem to be a problem for Microsoft as Skype just got the same thing. Michael2011 If Apple has a patent I'm sure it'll be invalidated by prior work: TextSecure was doing it before iMessage was developed. K77bkny Chill bruh, that makes too much sense, this is Google were talking about remember? https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/7e4e122766b4d1962adb9ad252e4a1dde7e24dfc490249cefc250e724a5f5746.gif blassster I say forget about using phone numbers altogether unless the user doesn't have a Google account, use phone as a fallback for registration. It's not needed, and for tablet/web/no-SIM users it's just another barrier. John Samuel αΩ 4.5) Fix hangouts so it's no the slowest shittiest messaging app on my phone. bekifft Google is the new Microsoft in many, many ways and one of them is that they are now such a huge ship to steer, and it seems like they just aren't handling that well. What you say makes so much sense but the sheer bureaucracy at this point is far more of a challenge than the technology. Ritesh Been wondering and asking this myself. Forever. I mean, how difficult is it for Google management to understand something this obvious and simple? What a waste of time, labour and then having to go through the embarrassing outcomes! Dozens of redundant apps, none of them work a 100%. All the while WhatsApp just sits there and keeps doing it's thing, unmoved. And every time people discuss IM, I think about Telegram and go, what a pity! Because it literally has every single thing an IM app should have (except video calls). But no one bothers to look beyond WhatsApp, FB messenger or that abomination called Kik. iMessage too. Hangouts, if Google wanted to, could become the best of everything and kick everyone else out of the game. It's entirely possible. And doable. But Google somehow thinks making an Allo and a Duo is a better idea. Stupidity among some of the smartest people on the planet! Ben Everyone who knew anything about Android knew this would flop yet Google ignored everyone and guess what! It did flop. Đức Thành I don't think Google meant to ignore anyone, their vision was simply much bigger and they were blind to most anything else. I like the vision that Google has, but it seems some bridges need to be built first. If anything, it's Google's mistake that they didn't learn to cater to the most common denominator, to fill in the gaps and smooth things over, before moving on to more grandiose projects. Alex Not asking for all of Hangouts bloat and features. But no web client and no multi-device? Please. Not a chance. Carson Saldanha Agreed. There's a lot of unnecessary Hangouts features, but the main ones, like you stated, should've been incorporated with Allo already. Nate Only reason I'm not using it. The moment it gets multiple devices and a web client is when I'll use it. bekifft For the amount of effort it took to create Allo surely they could have cleaned up / released a lighter version of Hangouts, which is what nearly every informed person has been begging them to do for literally years. Kendrick Vargas How is this a surprise to anyone? Google's problem isn't that they can't make a good messaging client, it's that messaging discovery is REALLY bad on Android. Messaging clients shouldn't be the focus, the Contacts app should be. JohnD Whoever is in charge of product development needs to be fired. Google is known for releasing half baked products and then utterly abandoning them. Look at Google glass, Hangouts, etc. Ridiculous that such a big company would have terrible product execution and QA. catalysto Glass was abandoned after an enormous public backlash against it; that's not a good example. I would have chosen something like Google TV or Wave. JohnD You obviously got the idea. That was my point. catalysto Just sayin'. SunnyStroker Google, half baked products always in beta. This company suffers from a major case of ADD, (attention deficit disorder). 卯ノ花 烈 ® ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵃᶜᶜᵒᵘᶰᵗ They need to update it to handle text messaging. Most hate having multiple messaging apps. FB messenger I use for only FB friends. Not SMS. I love allo but until they make it an sms client I highly doubt it will pick up. I use Whatsapp for foreign friends in Germany, Netherlands etc I would love allo as default messenger locally that is the one thing keeping people from mass adopting it. Lateef Alabi-Oki Google earned their well-deserved reputation by make cloud services that ran of every freaking device, on every freaking screen size, on every freaking form factor and on every freaking OS. Then out of nowhere, they create this aberration called Allo. That only works on one device. Yes, you heard that right, folks. Google wrote an app that works on ONE and only ONE device. What the fuck were they thinking? This is the sort of stupidity that I'd expect from Apple. I refuse to accept Allo as a Google product. And I curse it and the day is strayed from the Google ethos. Đức Thành This is probably related to some speculation I've been repeating on a surprisingly regular basis lately: Google most probably has a communication problem where a bunch of really brilliant and similarly competent people don't exchange information and ideas and intentions nearly well enough. That is probably what leads to a wide range of really good products and services that don't, well, connect or fit well together; as well as many other related problems. I have a feeling and lots of reasons to believe that, if we solve this fundamental communication problem, other solutions will follow. In fact, many problems might likely resolve themselves. How do we reach the higher-ups at Google, again? If anyone happens to know, please tell me, because I honestly have no idea but I really want to try doing something about this. MasterDoughBoy Expect from Apple ?? Not hardly. Apple is excellent about making all of their products work together. m-p{3} As long as it doesn't provide the same ability as Google Assistant and IFTTT, and multi-device presence, I'm not interested in Allo. Ace Google missed the bus they had huge android bade and could have done something like imessage. But instead we got Google Talk then Hangouts then Allo. tiger Sorry, last time i checked, Apple main services are very well integrated and well-thought out. Ace Yes and Google is launching a half baked app every 12 months. It should try something similar to Apple. I guess it's too late now whatsapp has got the user base and no one will move from its platform. Whatsapp has voice, video and text. makapav Every 6 months. YouTube messaging > Spaces > Duo > Allo ... And I probably missed a few along the way while other important Google products like GBoard have yet to crossover from iOS to Android because Rajan Patel is too busy on Allo(?) instead of listening to his user base. Carson Saldanha YouTube messaging is a thing? LOL makapav Tell the moron that approved that project. But then again, we also have Spaces running for a record 7 months. I fear Allo will due before Spaces. That will be the day. Carson Saldanha Why tf is Spaces even a thing by Google? Haven't they known already that they've failed at the social media network? Why waste your time, resources, and money on something as stupid as this? John Samuel αΩ I will remember that next time I get 10 pages of garbage text because an iOS user tried to send me a contact. Or when an iOS user tries to message several people and they're not all on iOS themselves. Or when an iOS refugee suddenly can't receive texts from their old iOS contacts. tiger Next time you will need to stop lying. MasterDoughBoy Been using iOS devices for the past 6 years. Have never had a single problem you just described and I do all of the things you just described. John Samuel αΩ That's exactly what's so frustrating about it. Much like Scientology, if you're in it it doesn't seem fucked up because everything has internal consistency. It's the rest of us on the outside that can see how screwed up it is. JohnD I guess nobody at Google uses their own products. That's the only way to explain all this half baked crap. Maybe Google execs use Apple lmao. Pessimippopotamus I just want Google to cancel it altogether so that it can go back to ruining Hangouts. DenverRalphy My biggest complaint about Google, is how piss poor they are when it comes to instant messaging in the smartphone market. Which is surprising, because Google Talk was actually pretty friggin good when it was just pc's instant messaging. Somehow Google, with all the friggin brainiacs they have in that company, can't grasp the simple concept of a decent instant messenger. Why? It's not frigigin rocket science. Their last 3 attempts had huge glaring holes in them that any 13 year old kid could find exception with. WTH Google? Seriously... get it together. It's not THAT difficult. Paul Troy If mysms had video calling, I wouldn't need anything else. Mysms syncs with all my devices. Including w10 pc . HSidhu Someone true said that this website will make news out of anything, anything... does this post makes any sense? common vn33 "a complete lack of multi-device support, no message backup, no support for alternate protocols like SMS or RCS, and no web or desktop client" That's why I didn't bother download and try to use another chat client William Aleman I don't always create apps nobody needs, but when I do they always suck. - Google PhaseBurn I downloaded Allo the day it released, along with Duo. I've used both exactly once, each. Everybody else I know still uses Hangouts, including me for SMS because of Google Voice. Can't say Allo is a total dud, but, looking like it. Will be years before it picks up any momentum and they blew their launch opportunity to change this. brian. I don't see how this is surprising. Well, I like to use the Google bot to give me suggestions without having to speak them. That's about all I use it for. LOL When u have sh1t for ideas, it's best to copy )) d1ckheads should have improved Hangouts with new features, even today it's still buggy as fck Carson Saldanha Or better yet, renamed Hangouts to Allo, kept all the good features, redesigned the app to make it faster, and remove video calling from Hangouts (to make it faster) to form Duo. LOL Everyone needs to send Feedbacks in all those Allo, Duo, Hangouts, etc apps, perhaps Google will listen JD Ahahahahah Google ahahahah Listen. Oh man that's a good one Atoqir Spaces, that other semi-social sharing app they launched this year doesn't fair better. Google is good at stuff like Gmail, Inbox, Search, Photos, Drive. But when it comes to social the train already left the station long ago. They will never be big in social. Which is fine, they already have most of the market covered anyway. You can't be good at everyting. I have my messaging apps. All my contacts are on WhatsApp and Messenger. And there is always SMS as fallback. There is no need for a Google messaging app anymore at this point. Even if they remake WhatsApp or iMessage. What's the point apart from having a Google logo... Leahelm The question is does Google really care if Allo takes off? I mean yes of course they'd rather have more users than less. But if it was to add SMS to it how would that help what Allo is trying to accomplish. SMS can't handle their stickers, or Google Assistant, or search, or any of the other advanced features so why integrate it? If it was the one app to rule them all, with SMS built in, most likely 99% of the messages through it would be basic text and be useless to them. It would probably even decrease the use of advanced features in it because being the default app people would use it as simply as possible and just send a basic emoticon instead of trying out something different. So it would just sit there and be Messenger with a bunch of unused features on the side. I have nothing but speculation on Google's side but I'd imagine they'd rather have it used by a lesser amount of dedicated users than have it be used by tons more people who only send plain SMS with it. Patrick Smithopolis I've started using Facebook messenger. I'm not a fan of the app (there's too much going on) but it has one thing that Allo doesn't - proper SMS integration. freshprince_87 But the SMS integration does not work like iMessage... Patrick Smithopolis I don't care that it doesn't work like iMessage. If I wasn't using Facebook messenger I would be using Textra or another text messaging app. freshprince_87 That's your choice. But every other android user wants Allo to have SMS integration just like iMessage. If you read correctly on Android Police posts specifically about Google Allo, most Android users want it to have SMS integration or they're not using it. So basically we need iMessage for Android so we won't have to clog up ours phones with multiple messaging apps anymore Carson Saldanha This Reddit post pretty much sums up why Google has such trouble with bringing SMS into it's messaging apps... https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/53uvvu/why_sms_fallback_isnt_the_holy_grail_you_all/ kamiller42 Allo +SMS integration + Google Assistant listening in on all of it = Wonderful surveillance tool. eddiepearson So is using the internet. Do you have your extra large tin foil hat as well? kamiller42 There are many ways to keep things private. Opening an unsecured channel of communications with all of your contacts to Google, Facebook, Microsoft, etc. isn't one of them. Johny Bravo nothing what you do on internet is ever private, accept that, you will sleep better kamiller42 Johny Bravo says all encryption on the Internet is pointless. SSL/TLS, end to end encryption, etc. are all passing fads. Plain text everywhere. a.d.AM I actually like allo. I've converted my family and some friends who have android to it. So it's kind of a close circle messaging app for me now. I use hangouts for the few friends I have that have iPhone and for SMS. Everything has been working out great so far. Carson Saldanha Yes, same here, but it's still a problem for Andorid users. We may not think it's such a big deal, but Google should combine all this into one app, like iOS. ekngee Google Singapore shifted into their brand-spanking new office buildings a month ago. I've yet to hear anyone in Singapore using Allo or Duo John Samuel αΩ You know how hard it is to get a meaningful number of contacts to sign up for and download a new messaging service? I did it with hangouts and it took years. YEARS. I'm not even going to try with Duo because God knows how long it will be around or when it will be replaced. Matt Kercher Google's focus on tech seems to be ripping out all the features that everyone cared about and instead using what's hot to sell their products. "What's that, you want a home assistant? Here's Google Home, it doesn't have Bluetooth or Z-Wave, nor does it support G-Suite accounts, but it has that really cool AI thingy that everyone is talking about." Google's latest product line-up reminds me of that Onion video of HP's Cloud. Dennis Bareis If I can't even safely send messages to people and know they will receive them, then guess what, I'm not going to use it. You can't even tell an Allo user from one who isn't, how stupid is that? Cole Apple IS setup with I message. Damnation. pfmiller Scrap it for parts. The cool features could be integrated into Hangouts pretty easily and then some people may actually get to use them. frozencloud They didn't expect that stickers will pull us over to allo did they? JD I don't know about the lot of you but I find myself routing for Google to totally and utterly fail and fall from grace like Microsoft so they will lose the Blackberry level of hubris and go back to doing things people actually want. Craig Nelson I'm very disappointed with Allo. I guess I assumed it would improve greatly on Hangouts and it didn't. The few people I got to join so I could converse with them stopped using the service. It's sad. Google just needs to add RCS to messenger with Google now integration and call it a day whispy_snippet Well frankly I'm shocked. JG And so, slowly but surely, it seems we're starting to just tell Google to build Hangouts all over again That's exactly what I think Google should have done. Rather than launching an entirely new app, Google should have done a total overhaul of Hangouts, cleaned out all of the extra bulk from the existing app and added in the Assistant, whisper/SHOUT, ink, sticker packs, etc and launched it as a new and improved Hangouts 13 (or whatever the next major version would have been back then). Kind of like how Shazam and Facebook and such have been launching "lite" versions of their apps. They've gone through, in some cases started from scratch, and made the app cleaner so it uses less bandwidth and takes up less space and other resources on the phone. Google could have taken advantage of the large already established Hangouts user base and began collecting conversational data to feed the AI as soon as the phone completed the automatic update rather than having to wait for us geeks to start convincing our friends and family members to download yet another app, create a new account and figure out a new interface. And with potentially years worth of Hangouts chat logs to digest, the Assistant could already have a good understanding of how we talk and would have a huge head start on the "It gets better the more you use it" side of things... And since Hangouts already supports multiple device usage and SMS... The two main detractors for Allo would have never been an issue. Not only could I continue to text from my desktop, I could even use the Assistant's auto-reply suggestions. djghettoredneck Love it! I agree. I enjoy Hangouts, just need to put back merged messages. Naga Sridhar Funny story, everyone here seems not to have Allo on their phones yet the Allo thread always end up having tonnes of comments! Tomasz Badowiec The reasons is simple. Android users, me included, envy iMessage for years now and Allo could finally fill this void. But it did not happen and we are disappointed a lot. Hence this vocal crowd in comments. There is not much more in this. Google failed to deliver this time, and it failed hard. Naga Sridhar I am not sure if it failed to deliver hard, I just feel the route they are taking is a different one! They needed to offer first what the others arent offering, focus on their strengths not to work on matching their competitors one to one. I for sure agree that we need web browser support, an integrated SMS option, but I feel they will push this one harder. I like the route they have taken so far! And the only way we can encourage Google to build upon this app is by using it more, not by getting rid of it! syxbit The stupidest thing about allo is that you don't even know who of your friends has signed up. They all look the same, so you don't know if you're going to send them a text, or an allo message. Totally stupid! JacobTheDev I still think this could be a success if it where an iMessage clone. Lacking SMS support, along with only being usable on one device, pretty much doomed it in the US. hzd There is absolutely no point in worrying about this, it's too late already the app died about 30seconds after most users tried to send a message to a mobile number and realised there was no SMS / RCS. Google could do anything they like with this app until they are blue in the face and the dev teams fingers have become nail less bloody Stubs mashing away at their terminals. Dead on arrival, Google refuse to listen to their user base, they took 6 years to add a bloody reboot option and still can't build a dark UI option and took them almost 5 years to make a decent camera app that plays well with their own milestone devices ( Nexus ) and they still persist to ignore users for god knows what reason. ?!? It's like half their software teams are run by good leaders and the rest dwell in theor own butt holes of arrogance. Look at Google maps it's a fantastic app and is possibly the best map service in the world now, we have street view and everything and lane information for most roads in mapped areas, but they can't make a message app that does sms ? It's maddening and totally bizarre Mr.Bean Hangouts déjà vu all over again. Google can't seem to get it straight with messaging. Gonza I don't know if Allo is good or bad, but that's not even the problem. The problem is that it is LATE ! ericshmerick It was just day one lookie-loos. Another failed app from Google. Unless they have a iMessage competitor (no, not hangouts) they will continue to fail. Brett Wcislo Until Allo has proper SMS integration, it'll remain stalled. José Gómez Personally, I didn't even give Allo or Duo a try. It's hard to trust a company that releases a great product, loses interest, and kills the product once they lose interest. I already evangelised for enough Google products to probably lose my credibility too. When the SMS banners came out on Hangouts asking to give Messenger a try started appearing, and Allo and Duo were being teased, I decided to finally sell out and get a Facebook account. I have since then migrated most of my conversations to Facebook Messenger, and rarely even use Hangouts now, except for the few holdouts on Hangouts. Google need to inspire confidence in their products again, before I jump onboard something new as blindly as I once did. Bruce Wayne Yup. I used to preach Google products to my family and friends. Never again. Google doesn't even believe in their own products. They just make something, lose interest, discard it and move onto the next. PandaBread Allo is stupid. No advantage over the more established whatsapp messenger. Heck, hangouts is more useful than this whatsapp wannabe. At least whatsapp can be installed to multiple devices. They should've just placed all their efforts in improving hangouts instead. Jordan L Allo needs full SMS integration, multi-device, web client, and it needs to the default "SMS" app on ALL android phones. Trysta I'd like to know what Google's true goal with Allo even was. If it was to provide Android with a real answer to iMessage, I would love to see them STOP completely all AI integration. Not that the Google Assistant is bad but it isn't what anyone wants or needs in their messaging app. Instead partner with someone established (like WhatsApp) and heavily promote or preinstall whatsapp on all Android phones going forward. Yes you lose some power over your platform but you make Android so much better and you promote an excellent cross platform solution which is what we need. Basically, I would love to see Google stop trying to further fragment the messaging market. It isn't helping. If on the otherhand Google just wants to keep pushing their AI vision through as many outlets as possible, carry on. I won't be downloading it. Sir_Brizz Facebook owns WhatsApp, so no. Google wanted WhatsApp. Also, I don't see the value in leaving out the Assistant. It's nice enough and competitive with other messengers. The problem is that they don't have a competitive overall product. Something as seemingly innocuous as their sticker packs are utterly far behind their competitors. iMessage and Facebook both have Star Wars sticker packs and sticker packs from recent movies and TV shows (more than 1-2). They also have a framework for community sticker packs. Whether you personally care about sticker packs or not, this is an area that average people look and see the gap. It's not the only one, and it seems small, but it's one of many things. Another area would be the in-chat games. They have a very poor selection. In addition to this, they are missing big features mentioned in this article. These are all things they have to fix if they want to have any chance of Allo competing in the busy marketplace. Bruce Wayne Why would Google give their rival an unprecedented priority position on their OS? Socaltyger Wake me up when it's out of beta. lomsha Yea, haven't launched the app in weeks, not even for assistant. Jonathan Figueroa Why can't they just improve Hangouts? Scott Ricketts No one at Google wants to maintain a product. They want to make a cool new one. Maintaining code isn't sexy. Đức Thành This is really sad. It's a great app, the world just isn't ready for it yet. But instead of bridging the gap and slowly building it up, why does Google always have to go to the extremes? Is it because of the Curse of Knowledge, again? That Googlers are so brilliant that they fail to consider the more common users, the majority of people's perspectives and preferences? Simply because they don't know how to? I guess it's no surprise, considering how the people inside of Google have made one baseless assumption so many times when it comes to interpersonal relationships: the assumption that everyone is just as Intellectual and Logical as they are. This is also why Facebook and Snapchat works but Google Plus doesn't: the former two cater to the fundamental, whimsical needs of the common man, whereas the latter appeals to the more rational parts that often take time to develop and aren't possessed by many. Everyone knows Google is bad at communication, but the real problem seems to be something more fundamental and the problem with communication only indicates that. I'm still trying to figure out what exactly that problem is, though I have a feeling we're getting pretty close, but in the meantime I guess I have one tip that Google needs to be reminded of: People are not rational. If we talk in terms of the book "Thinking, fast and slow" by Daniel Kahneman then it would be: Most people are controlled by System 1 (Fast, automatic, frequent, emotional, stereotypic, subconscious) more than by System 2 (Slow, effortful, infrequent, logical, calculating, conscious). So build a system, an app, a website, anything that caters to System 1 first then we go from there, and we'll have something to talk about. Atoqir The problem here is that all those "casuals" and "rationals" you talk about already have all these features in other apps (Skype, Facebook, WhatsApp, iMessage) So why should all those people have to change to "the same functionality app but with a Google logo". They can just continue using what they already have. Google is very successful in many domains (mail, search, collaboration, photos, mobileOS, browser, casting, AI ...). You can't be leader in every corner of the market. Social/communications is cleary Facebook who holds the crown with Messenger/Facebook/WhatsApp/Instagram. Đức Thành That's a good point as well. Google has missed out on so many opportunities to get the early market share, so it's only going to get increasingly more difficult to get the consumers to switch over from other services. Something along the line of the words of a certain podcaster whom I'm a huge fan of, there is a significant price for every transition, so the new service should be at least 10x better, and sometimes even that wouldn't be worth enough to make people change their minds. Atoqir To be honest I think it is too late for another big messaging competitor in these times. This area is too settled. Just like the browser market, mobile OS and Linux/Windows/Mac markt seems fixed for a while now. Also if you make a service 10x better it usually means 10x different or 10x complex which will scare those users off again. This doesn't matter for products like photos, storage, mail etc because these are mostly personal decisions and only I interact with those services. But a big factor for choosing a messaging solutions is userbase. That is exactly the problem that Allo has. The service, APIs, tech, apps and a few willing Google geeks are there. But not the friends, families, collegues etc. That's what matters for messaging. Đức Thành Yup that's another problem to consider. What if Google just keeps it consistent, and waits for the userbase to learn until they know what's good for them? Would this be a possible solution? Atoqir No there is only 1 setup where I see them succeding and that is going to war with their OEMS. If they include and force them to install a Google Messaging, Phone and Contacts app. To be honest the ideal way to get everyone on the same line is - release phone app with calling and built-in Duo functionality - release messaging app with SMS and Allo functionality (like iMessage) - release contacts app with search, assistant functionality and hooks to the phone and messaging app from my point 1 and 2 For preventing to have a closed iOS-like operating system make it possible to easily change those default apps to others (my current galaxy has a handy menu for this) But they will never accomplish this cause OEMs will not like it. And the Android community wouldn't like it either. Or you end up with default Google apps, carrier calling apps and OEM calling apps that you can't remove... browngeek Is anyone really surprised? Well maybe Google is. Justine Chang Google just needs to make ONE, yes, ONE APP, for internet call, video calls, chatting, connected via our mobile phone numbers and Google accounts. Replace the messaging app that every Android phone comes with, and then people will naturally use it. Bruce Wayne I don't even have these apps installed and I have an Android phone. Maleko People can say 'all it needs is SMS integration'... But that won't help. Google bringing ANOTHER messaging app is just ridiculous. Just bake DUO and assistant into Hangouts, bring SMS back... Sorted. Rami No surprise here, few people trust Google to keep an app alive for enough time to be usable. I tried converting my family members to pass to hangouts, but they couldn't manage it, not stables then changed UI a lot. they prefer using Skype. Michael2011 They simply could have added Allo features to their Messenger app and turned encryption on by default to make their own Signal app. Robert Macdonald It's installed by default on my Pixel yet ironically because I have assistant built into the phone and use only use messenger the Pixel renders Allow null and void. I uninstalled it day one. LondonLeedsFan I've used, and still use Allo sometimes, but when WhatsApp have such a good product, I'm not really sure why people who aren't that fussed about Google apps would move to Allo. There's no advantage other than Assistant, and not everyone is even bothered about that. Gibki Bongo I keep it installed but honestly I have never used it except for a test "hello world" chat. I still use Hangouts. They could at least have added Allo-Hangouts interoperability. erptastic What Google does not seem to understand is that WhatsApp can only be so successful (minus the US) while being a pile of shit is because it has been around since the iPhone 3G days (?) when there were no alternatives and people were simply amazed by the idea of sending "MMS" for free. And now it has gained such a "standard" reputation so that anybody is too lazy or scared to change. Allo, on the other hand, is approx. 7 years leate with a feature set missing what people expect nowadays (even WhatsApp has gained that duct-taped-on desktop support to silence people). mattj78 3 of my contacts have installed Allo. All of them have Whatsapp. Why would I even bother to use Allo? It's too late and too crap Mahootzki Now that Whatsapp has video calling, I see no need for anything else, ever. . . b0b Allo was supposed to cure cancer and save humanity if the pre-hype release in well known android circlejerks was to be believed. It failed. In true Google fashion, it shall be replaced by a new app called Dodo. Iamsecond In Allo, no-one can hear you scream... alexg Just stick the damn Assistant in Hangouts and get rid of Allo, jeez.... raffr This is not really surprise is it? For allo to continue to grow, average smartphone users ( not tech nerds) need to get on board. Are whatsapp and imessage users really going to change to a new messaging app that offers limited (if any) benefit over their preferred method? Alexandre Botelho SMS support damnit. Make it the iMessage of Android and it's guaranteed to succeed. Matt Allo reminds me of the Amazon phone, in that a company decided to enter a new product into a mature market while seemingly never asking "Who is going to want this?" jamez243 Lack of a webapp my guess ahow628 Until I can know who has Allo installed, I refuse to use it. Choda Boy Gee, I guess stickers just aren't enough. Oatz I just don't get it. Allow me to make Allo my default for SMS and it needs to be the standard Android messaging app for this to work in my opinion. Google has all the resources at their fingertips and continue to put forth a lackluster effort. Pick one and focus on it! -__- With that being said, I deleted Allo because I couldn't make it default and no one I knew used it so I felt like all the "cool features" were useless. RespawnAnon I actually like this for group chatting with friends, but sms support would be nice to have. BoFiS yawn, because Hangouts is still more full-featured and useful, built into gmail, works across devices and computers all on the same account, with the same conversations and logs, and it does video conferencing, audio chat, etc. Why would I dump all of that for Allo or Duo? Makes no sense...they should fold them all into Hangouts and just work on improving the app's performance! Alfonso Surroca On a positive note, at least the name will allow tech journalists to write articles with titles like "Au revoir, Allo" when Google inevitably kills this app (and makes two or three more to replace it). OrionBeast Allo? anybody home? sweenish Web client, and I will immediately drop Hangouts for Allo. I like it better in just about every way. But I need a web client. Same for Duo. Needs to be usable on the web. Nathan J Apple should just bring iMessage to Android and shut all these little IM clients down. Not that the Android crowd would rush in. But, then again, maybe they would. Sure, you'd have the jokers who download it just to give it one star and then uninstall. But with so many friends and family using it, maybe they'd just stick with it. And that makes sense, for Apple to do. Since iOS 10, they've been selling sticker packs, or rather, letting people sell sticker packs. And I'm sitting here thinking, I've switched to iPhone, and I know two other guys who've switched as well (sorry! not my fault!) but I still feel like iMessage is limited. You have to have one brand of phone to use it, so who would pay for accessories for that app? I guess the most loyal Apple users. But since Apple gets a cut of the sales, opening their IM platform up to 85% of the market or whatever Android commands these days would only mean more money in their pockets. They're probably just trying to figure out how to work the store in (most likely in-app purchases, but on the iOS side, it's handled through the App Store). As far as the 13 reviews on the App Store, reviewing on the App Store is a giant pain in the arse. I don't know what possessed me to make a super secure 30 digit password for Apple (I do for Google and Facebook as well, different ones I mean), but Apple wants me to enter it every time I want to review something up there. No. I'm not going to do that. I just won't review stuff if I gotta jump through hoops. The satisfaction I get isn't worth the effort. Oh. And then when the app updates, your review goes to this second class "All versions" area, it's not even the main review area. And it's like Android, apps update about as frequently, a little less actually, I guess because of the review procedure being stricter. Maybe Google should just give up on IM and focus on other things. Just about everyone has Facebook and Facebook Messenger is a fine IM app. For those who don't, there's Telegram... or a bunch of others, I guess. The argument for a universal IM is the same as the argument for a universal language. Fine if it's yours, not so fine if it's not. A lot of Americans say English should be the universal language of Earth. Well, there are more Chinese than Americans, so what if Chinese is the universal language? All of a sudden, the different languages scenario we have now starts to seem not so bad after all. Same with IMs... the more that fail, the more we realize that Facebook Messenger and Telegram aren't THAT bad. Or whatever you use. b_boogey_xl Must be all that great press Allo's been getting, huh. Channel 2012 Well, it's no wonder. Look at how rusty and worn out the icon looks! jo Well it is easy. If you do not like it do not use it. Google is perhaps the most successful company in the world and here are all you thinking you are smarter! Google is for modern people who does not mind replacing old habits with new. And if you are so smart why dont you build these applications you want yourself? The tech around them are easy and standard. I am glad Google do not listen to all this complaining.

X Ex-election candidate alleges religious discrimination by Google Mark Savage criticises search engine’s refusal to take down posts calling him a homophobe about 13 hours ago Mary Carolan File image of Mark Savage outside the Circuit Court. File photograph: Courts Collins         A former local election candidate told the High Court on Friday that Google is discriminating against him because of his religious beliefs by refusing to remove posts alleging he is a homophobe. Mark Savage, who ran as an Independent in Swords, Co Dublin, in the local elections in 2014, says the allegations that he is a homophobe are untrue. Google’s treatment of him was part of the internet giant’s own “worldwide campaign in support of LGBT issues and I take that as discrimination against me”, he said. Google was not responsive to his “take-down” request in relation to the homophobe claims because of his religious beliefs and “my disapproval for gay marriage, gay lifestyle and inappropriate behaviour”, he said. Mr Savage is opposing an appeal by the Data Protection Commissioner and Google over a Circuit Court decision in favour of Mr Savage’s application that internet threads relating to the allegation that he is a homophobe should be taken down under “right to be forgotten” guidelines. He had objected to a thread on Reddit describing him as: “Mark Savage - North County Dublins (sic) homophobic candidate.” The thread arose from election leaflets handed out during his campaign, which referred to “gay perverts cavorting en flagrante on the beach on broad daylight”. Google says that if the Circuit Court ruling is upheld, it will impose an “intolerable and unworkable” burden on search engines. On the second day of the appeal before Judge Michael White, Mr Savage, representing himself, argued that the Circuit Court decision should stand. He said the refusal of Data Protection Commissioner Helen Dixon to order Google to take down the thread showed a failure to comprehend a previous case in which a politician in the Labour Party, which supported a Yes vote in the same-sex marriage referendum, successfully applied for a take-down order. Mr Savage said Ms Dixon treated him less favourably than that politician because of his religious beliefs and opposition to gay marriage. He claimed she made her decision “as a favour to the [Labour] political party because it supported a Yes vote, but was not going to give it to this guy who was an election candidate in Swords because he was complaining about inappropriate behaviour by middle-aged men on public beaches in front of young children in broad daylight”. ‘A matter of opinion’ Responding to arguments from Cian Ferriter SC, for Google, that the threads reflected the opinions of individuals, Mr Savage said the effect of the Reddit thread was to present as fact a matter which was based on opinion. A fact could not be based on an opinion under defamation law, he said. In relation to the discussion which occurred on this Reddit thread, Mr Savage said he did not object to “ad-hominem” abuse, as he understood there was no right in law not to be offended. However, it was misleading for Google to claim the reason for permitting this thread was it was a matter of public interest, he said. He said he “did not mind the abuse”, but to call him a homophobe, which was not based on fact, was a different matter. He disputed Google’s claim that the homophobe thread appeared on the first page of a search of his name as the result of automatic word-searching. More recent information about him, including newspaper articles, did not appear before the Reddit thread, he said. The case resumes on Tuesday.       Topics: Helen Dixon Mark Savage Mary Carolan Michael White High Court Labour Cian Ferriter Google Dublin(IE)  Subscribe.   More from The Irish Times Politics Varadkar on course for victory in Fine Gael leadership contest Opinion Conservative manifesto maps out hard Brexit Pro12 Home comforts to help Munster clip Ospreys’ wings Social Affairs Government considers advice on Tuam mother-and-baby home Latest Ireland Inside Politics: Does the Fine Gael leadership contest matter? 06:00 Iranians cast presidential election votes in Dublin embassy 05:13 A galaxy far away: new mobile observatory for Kerry 01:00 Varadkar on course for victory in Fine Gael leadership contest 01:00 Prominent academic serving jail term for sex abuse of nephew 00:35 Most Read in News 1 Couple given one year to demolish house built without permission 2 Miriam Lord: Over avocado mash in hipster heaven Leo gives taste of things to come 3 One man’s long fight to put the uncle who raped him behind bars 4 Fintan O’Toole: Leo or Simon?

Mark Savage, who ran as an independent in Swords, Co Dublin, in the last elections told the High Court Google's treatment of him was part of the internet giant's own "worldwide campaign in support of LGBT issues and I take that as discrimination against me". Google was not responsive to his "take down" request in relation to the homophobe claims because of his religious beliefs and "my disapproval for gay marriage, gay lifestyle and inappropriate behaviour".

He objects to a thread on Reddit describing him as “Mark Savage - North County Dublins (sic) homophobic candidate”. The thread arose from election leaflets handed out during his campaign referring to “gay perverts cavorting en flagrante on the beach on broad daylight”. If the Circuit Court ruling on the right to be forgotten in favour of Mr Savage is upheld, it will impose an “intolerable and unworkable” burden search engines, Google says. On the second day of the appeal before Mr Justice Michael White, Mr Savage, representing himself, argued the Circuit Court decision should stand. He said the refusal of the Data Protection Commissioner Helen Dixon to order Google to take down the thread showed a failure to comprehend a previous case where a take down order was made for a politician in the Labour Party which supported a yes vote in the gay marriage referendum. The politician, who he did not want to name, had made inappropriate replies to a constituent who had contacted him. Ms Dixon treated Mr Savage less favourably than the politician, who succeeded in his take down request, because of his religious beliefs and opposition to gay marriage, he said. She basically took "almost verbatim" what Google had told her in her decision refusing a take down order for him, he said. He claimed she made her decision "as a favour to the political party because it supported a yes vote but was not going to to give it to this guy who was an election candidate in Swords because he was complaining about inappropriate behaviour by middle aged men on public beaches in front of young children in broad daylight". Responding to arguments from Cian Ferriter SC, for Google, in relation to the threads being opinions of people, Mr Savage said the effect of the Reddit thread was to present as a fact a matter which was based on an opinion. A fact could not be based on an opinion under defamation law, he said. In relation to the discussion which occurred on this Reddit thread, Mr Savage said he had did not object to "ad hominem" abuse as he understood there was no right in law not to be offended.

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars AI Opinion ProBeat: Google is betting AI will succeed search Emil Protalinski@EPro May 19, 2017 10:30 AM This year’s I/O developer conference felt a little repetitive. Almost everything announced was an iteration on what Google showed off last year. But there was one theme that was particularly clear, especially on day one: Google is becoming more and more confident with its bet on AI. The consumer version of this is Google Assistant. Last year, Google Assistant was merely introduced, not even launched. This year, there were so many features, integrations, and partnerships announced that we wrote a separate post just to summarize it all. Google is still looking for its next big revenue driver. Like how Microsoft had Windows and Office, or how Amazon has ecommerce and AWS, Google wants to find that number two. Search and ads are its bread and butter, but nothing lasts forever. The company needs another hit, and it knows that to find one will take years of investment. Google has settled on AI. The custom tensor processing unit (TPU) chips unveiled last year also got an update. TPUs are chips developed specifically for machine learning. Make no mistake: When a tech giant invests in infrastructure, it’s not messing around. Nobody at the company knows how the AI bet will play out, and that’s fine. The huge advantage of investing in AI is that it’s not a siloed vertical — you can use it to improve your products across the board, not unlike Google did by building search right into products like Gmail and Chrome. Assistant could be the search successor Google is looking for. I mean, you can now type to it just like into a Google Search box, not just use your voice. There are still many cases where a standard page of search results is preferable, but it’s easy to see how Google could consistently cut that down by improving Assistant. Or, Assistant could fizzle out like Google Now and Now on Tap before it. So far it’s got great momentum, but it’s nascent and unfinished. But that doesn’t really matter, because Google is playing the long game. Google isn’t throwing money into Assistant — it’s throwing money into AI and watching how that pays off across its current product line, its new projects, and beyond. If ads are what make search viable, AI is what makes Assistant viable. ProBeat is a column in which Emil rants about whatever crosses him that week.

Weekly Roundup: WannaCry ransomware attack, Google I/O, RecordGram wins Startup Battlefield Posted 14 hours ago by Anna Escher (@annaescher) 0 SHARES Next Story Facebook takes on Twitch with new live-streaming deal for esports This week the TechCrunch team threw another successful Disrupt conference, this time in New York City. 20 companies took the stage at TechCrunch’s Startup Battlefield, where they presented their products and took questions from our expert judges. The judges narrowed the competition down to five finalists. But RecordGram, a mobile recording studio where aspiring artists can find beats, create songs and get signed, won first place in the competition. You can listen to all of the interviews from our panelists including Derek Jeter, Naval Ravikant, Steve Case and many more on iTunes. Disrupt was preceded by a 24-hour Hackathon, during which 750 engineers and designers got together to create a cool hack. reVIVE, a VR solution created by a team of high school students that can provide both a diagnostic and treatment mechanism for ADHD, won first place. You can read about all of the hacks here. In the mean time, here are some of the top tech stories from this week. 1. WannaCry(pt) global ransomware attack wreaks havoc on systems worldwide A huge global ransomware attack based on leaked NSA hacking tools spread like wildfire among unpatched Windows systems worldwide on Friday. Early reports suggested it was targeted at the UK’s National Health Service, leading to routine appointments being cancelled. Thousands of computers were apparently affected in Russia alone. Critics have suggested a lack of government funding has left the NHS wide open to malware attacks that exploit outdated software, as the attack continued to wreak havoc on systems worldwide. It was only stopped by accident after a security researcher registered a web domain that had been hard-coded into it as a kill switch. 2. Google announces Google Lens and Google.ai, and Google Home gets proactive assistance  Artificial intelligence was the name of the game at Google’s annual I/O developer conference. Google Home is getting hands-free calling and proactive alerts, Android O beta went live (but we still don’t know what the O stands for), a new AI initiative that wants to make AI advances accessible to everyone was announced and Google Lens, a new tech that wants to bring more smarts into your phone’s camera, was announced. 3. The FCC officially proposes to end net neutrality rules The FCC voted to initiate a process to repeal the strong net neutrality rules that have been in place since 2015. The Senate Democrats penned an open letter, explaining that the existing net neutrality rules protect this foundation and the connected society that we all enjoy. Don’t let the FCC take that away. 4. Instagram launches selfie filters, copying the last big Snapchat feature Instagram’s testing of Location Stories was also revealed on the Disrupt stage, but the company’s main announcement of the week was that it is launching selfie filters for Instagram Stories. When asked about whether it is copying Snapchat, Instagram VP of Product Kevin Weil stated that “This is just the way the tech industry works.” 5. SpaceX successfully launches its heaviest geostationary orbital payload yet SpaceX launched a Falcon 9 rocket carrying a payload from communications satellite company Inmarsat, the fourth in a constellation created to provide high-bandwidth broadband internet globally. The payload is the largest ever launched on a Falcon 9, which is why the mission parameters didn’t call for an attempt to recover the first stage of the rocket. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Founded 1934 Overview Federal Communications Commission is an independent United States agency regulating interstate and international communications by radio, television, wire, satellite, and cable in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. territories.

At the same time, some of you are probably better off skipping it, at least right now. This week Google released the second Android O beta ahead of the official launch later this summer. You don’t need to be a developer or need to flash any scary files to try what’s coming next. All you need is a compatible device like the Pixel and to enroll in the beta. Read: How to Install the Android O Beta Today Our guide will go over everything you need to know about the Pixel Android O update. We’ll address the improvements, new features, performance, and how to downgrade back to Android 7.0 Nougat. Not to mention potential Google Pixel Android O problems and what you need to know moving forward. Google mentions it may contain errors or bugs that could affect how your phone functions, so keep that in mind. In fact, there’s a list of known problems in the beta release notes you may want to glance over before installing it. Some of those include performance issues, poor battery life, user interface glitches, Bluetooth drops, a slow camera and even WiFi bugs. The official Google Pixel Android O update is still a few months away. Once the 3rd and 4th betas arrive we’ll update this roundup with more info about performance, battery life, and detail any new features. Google Pixel Android O Performance & Impressions   1 / 9 Going from the first Android O preview to the second release and beta we received a 500MB file to download. Those coming from Android Nougat to O may have to download a larger file. It took less than five minutes to download the update, install Android O, and fully reboot in time to use the phone. This was a lot faster than we expected. After using the Google Pixel Android O beta for just under 24 hours this is our impressions on speed, performance, battery life, and Bluetooth. So far almost everything has been fine. Some of the crashes from the first preview are no longer happening. The software is fast, and connectivity seems great. We've connected to Verizon, AT&T, and tried two Bluetooth speakers with no problems. The same can be said for WiFi. It is stable, connects quickly and hasn't dropped once. We've tried two routers, and connected to both regular and 5G networks.  Some of the lag from the first release is gone too. Opening apps, pulling down the notification bar and doing other tasks is pleasantly fast. We haven't run into any freezing or reboots of the Pixel, but the camera app crashed once. WiFi is stable, connects with ease and has yet to experience any drops.  This is called a beta for a reason, the software isn't finished. Google is working hard on adding in each new feature, making changes, and improving everything. This is no way a finished product, at least not yet. We recommend waiting for the 3rd beta sometime in June, as that should be more stable and have most of the features fully incorporated. As the release date nears the experience will improve.   1 / 9 Leave a Reply Cancel Reply Your email address will not be published. Comment Name* Email* Website

Oh, and I bet you still answer your front door. You probably even operate the lights manually. Or have a traditional burglar alarm. Home automation (putting all your domestic appliances online so they can be controlled from a central unit such as an iPad or iPhone) will render all those actions as quaint as using a telephone box or renting films on a VHS tape.  Easy living: These days your home can be entirely in tune with your habits - without you lifting a finger Stores such as John Lewis have seen a leap in demand from customers for these products. Wireless music systems such as Sonos are already well established, but homeowners increasingly want to be able to remotely control their heating and lighting, and be able to access surveillance cameras in their home.

'Our bestselling products include the Nest Learning Thermostat and Nest Cam.' The Nest Learning Thermostat has technology that adapts to your habits, turning heating off in unused rooms and on in occupied areas. The heat is on: The Nest learning Thermostat is a best-seller at John Lewis The Nest Cam and the Canary Home monitoring camera are also increasingly popular, sending camera feeds of your home to your mobile. They come with an in-built alarm and night vision. I particularly like the sound of Ring, which is a video doorbell with an inbuilt camera and audio that lets you talk to people at your front door, even when you're not at home. The Nest Protect smart smoke and carbon monoxide alarm is also appealing. I live in fear of our incredibly loud smoke alarm waking up our children when we accidentally burn toast, but this gadget alerts you to smoke detected in the house and you can stop the alarm before it goes off. The Alexa — which is also known as the Amazon Echo — is a voice-activated robot that is becoming increasingly popular.  'She' will respond to requests to find out train times or turn lights on and off. You can ask such things as 'Where is my wife?' or 'Play the theme tune from Star Wars!'  Instant answers: Google Home, powered by Google, will answer all sorts of questions and play music  Google's answer to the Alexa is called Google Home, newly launched, which operates in the same way as Alexa, but powered by Google instead of Amazon.  This is all very well, but if you have a fully automated home what happens when there is a power cut? Or your broadband is erratic. Will I not be able to make a cup of tea or put a wash on if the internet goes down?  Julia Maybury, 35, from Cheltenham, has no such qualms now her husband has installed 'smart' functions. 'Yes, it's tricky when the wifi goes down. We have Sonos, for music, Wemo to control the lights and a Tado for the heating,' says Julia. 'I don't get the point of Wemo — why do you need to control your lights from your phone? 'Though it's good when you're away and you want to make it look as if someone's home.'  It's true that a good wifi network and broadband sSRci service is key, says Katie Sparrevohn, of London Residential AV Solutions, a company that designs and installs high-spec home automation systems. Lights, camera, action: The Wemo netcam allows you to see what's going on at home even when you aren't there 'The wired and wireless networks within a property are now the most important foundation for any smart home,' she says.  'So our bestselling products are our wifi systems, which are robust and rarely fail.' hbor wc a ' The systems also come with a battery back-up in case of power cuts. That's all very well, but if you struggle to set the clock on your microwave, how easy will you find it to use a fully automated home? 'We always state that a four-year-old child or an 80-year-old grandparent should be able to walk into a house and use one of our systems,' says Sparrevohn. Of course, none of this is cheap, says Chris Hellel from Lasyl, which also fits home automation systems. 'We have people coming in who have seen friends' set-ups, or like the idea of home automation but are a bit taken aback by the numbers.  With tech such as this, the sky is the limit in terms of price. You can spend £100,000 without thinking about it.' Of course, it doesn't have to be that bad. If you just want a central unit to control your TV and audio, that might start at £5,000. It all sounds exhausting. I might go and put the kettle on — all by myself.   Share or comment on this article e-mail Comments 0 Share what you think No comments have so far been submitted.

Joe Mullin - May 19, 2017 5:07 pm UTC Enlarge / Anthony Levandowski, VP of engineering at Uber, speaking to reporters at the Uber Advanced Technologies Center on September 13, 2016 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. ANGELO MERENDINO/AFP/Getty Images reader comments 86 Share this story Uber has threatened to fire its top self-driving car engineer if he doesn't comply with a court order and hand over documents in the Waymo v. Uber trade secrets lawsuit. The lawsuit, filed by Google self-driving car spinoff Waymo in February, claims that Uber engineer Anthony Levandowski illegally downloaded more than 14,000 files when he was working on self-driving cars at Google. Levandowski quit Google without notice in January, then founded a self-driving car startup called Otto, which was sold to Uber within a few months for $680 million. Levandowski, who is not a defendant in the case, pled the Fifth Amendment and answered almost no questions when he was deposed. Further ReadingJudge’s order bars Uber engineer from Lidar work, demands return of stolen filesLast week, US District Judge William Alsup issued an order barring Levandowski from any work on lidar, the key technology behind self-driving cars. The order also calls on Uber to do a thorough investigation, listing every person "who has seen or heard any part of the downloaded materials;" interview everyone who has communicated with Levandowski about lidar; and submit a log of "all oral and written communications" in which Levandowski mentions lidar. In the order, Alsup points out that in his view, Uber could also "threaten Levandowski with termination for noncompliance," without violating Levandowski's Fifth Amendment privilege. Levandowski's lawyers are still fighting against that, and they asked the judge to reconsider parts of that order in a motion filed yesterday. In those papers, Levandowski reveals that Uber has, indeed, threatened him with termination, and his team includes the letter his employer sent him. Pride and privilege "Uber has now executed on the court's order," Levandowski's attorneys write. On May 16, Uber sent Levandowski a letter demanding that he provide any relevant information, even if it's located on personal devices. Levandowski must waive any Fifth Amendment protection, and his lawyers must cooperate as well regardless of attorney-client privilege. Uber's letter to Levandowski, reproduced in part in yesterday's motion, reads as follows: We understand that this letter requires you to turn over information wherever located, including but not limited to, your personal devices, and to waive any Fifth Amendment protection you may have. Also, the requirement that your lawyers cooperate with us and turn over information that may be in their possession may invade your attorney-client privilege. While we have respected your personal liberties, it is our view that the Court’s Order requires us to make these demands of you. Footnote 9 of the Order specifically states that “in complying with this order, Uber has no excuse under the Fifth Amendment to pull any punches as to Levandowski.” (Order at 23, no. 9.) Thus, we must demand that you set these privileges aside and confirm that you will promptly comply with the Court’s Order. Finally, as you know, your employment at Uber is on an at-will basis. See A. Levandowski Employment Agreement, Aug. 17, 2016 ¶ 5(a) (“August 17, 2016 Employment Agreement”). As a condition of your employment at Uber, you must comply with all of the requirements set forth in this letter. If you do not agree to comply with all of the requirements set forth herein, or if you fail to comply in a material manner, then Uber will take adverse employment action against you, which may include termination of your employment and such termination would be for Cause. Levandowski's lawyers have asked to intervene in the case to protect his Fifth Amendment and attorney-client privilege "and prevent the Court from unconstitutionally forcing him to choose between his privileges and continued employment." Attorneys for Levandowski argue that Supreme Court precedent prevents him being forced to make a choice between staying employed and giving self-incriminating testimony. They cite Garrity v. New Jersey, a 1967 case in which the high court found that a group of police officers were improperly compelled to testify by being threatened with removal from their jobs. The argument is unlikely to change Judge Alsup's mind on the issue. Uber has already tried this tack, citing a 9th Circuit case to argue that "individuals cannot be forced to waive their Fifth Amendment rights against self-incrimination by threats that their employment will be terminated." Alsup called that suggestion "baseless." Uber is a private employer that is being compelled "to do whatever it can to ensure that its employees return 14,000-plus pilfered files to their rightful owner." If Uber threatened to terminate Levandowski, the engineer would "remain free to forfeit his private employment to present his Fifth Amendment privilege," Alsup wrote.

New, 57 comments Siri vs. Assistant by Chaim Gartenberg@cgartenberg May 19, 2017, 1:12pm EDT share tweet Linkedin Some of the biggest news to come out of Google I/O this week was that Google Assistant is coming to iOS, looking to take a shot at Siri, Apple’s own entrenched AI assistant. While Assistant has been available on Android for a while now, how does the AI assistant stack up against Siri when its forced to go head-to-head on Apple’s far more limited playing field? We put the two head-to-head. Access One of the most important parts of any AI assistant is how easy it is to access. One of the biggest selling points of Amazon’s Echo hardware is the always-listening feature that lets Alexa always be on hand to respond to any queries or commands. On Android, Assistant has deep, OS-level hooks that make it more more accessible and functional. But on iOS, things are a little tougher. Siri: On Apple’s hardware, Siri still has a massive home court advantage when it comes to actually starting the digital assistant. Namely, Siri is baked into iOS on a core level — its accessible from anywhere, whether you’re in an app or at your lock-screen by simply holding down the home button. Siri is also always listening, too, and can be activated anytime through a “Hey, Siri” command on newer iPhones (although the feature, like much of Siri these days, feels largely half-baked.) Assistant: Google is making a big play here with Assistant, but it’s fighting an uphill battle here with the inherent limitations Apple has on iOS. That means that Assistant lives in the Assistant app. But Google is doing its best to put Assistant in as many places as possible: there’s an Assistant widget to quick launch the app, which is accessible from both the notification shade, the lock screen, and the home screen. Plus, there’s a 3D Touch action to also start Assistant. Hardware integration Unlike when Siri first launched back in 2011, AI assistants can’t just work with a single device anymore. Working on an iPhone is one thing — but working across an entire ecosystem is a whole other ballgame. Siri: The best thing that can be said about Apple’s assistant is that it exists on a variety of hardware platforms. If you’ve got an Apple Watch, a Mac, or an Apple TV, you can use Siri on it, but that’s about the extent of it. Siri on different platforms largely exist as separate things — you can’t use the native Siri on your iPhone to play a song on your Apple TV, for example, or use Siri on your Apple TV to make a call. Controlling smart home utilities with Siri only works if manufacturers support Apple’s HomeKit, and you’ll need either an Apple TV or iPad to serve as a hub. Plus, you’re still locked strictly to Apple’s ecosystem — if Cupertino doesn’t make hardware for it (like, say, an Amazon Echo-like speaker), then you can’t use Siri on it. Assistant: Obviously, just like Siri works with Apple stuff, Assistant works with Google stuff. That means Chromecast, Android phones, and of course, Google Home. But one of the announcements to Assistant at I/O was that third-party hardware manufacturers would be able to integrate Assistant into their own devices, which means that there could be a much larger ecosystem for Assistant in the near future. Google also showed off how Assistant can work across multiple devices — using a Chromecast to display visual results from a Google Home, suggesting a more universal experience than Siri. How that will work in practice is still somewhat unclear, given that the feature doesn’t seem to be available yet (at least through Assistant on an iPhone.) But it speaks to Google’s larger ambitions of having a unified Assistant platform across all devices. Functionality: Of course, an assistant is only useful if it can actually assist you with things. And at this point, there's basic table stakes that both platforms are able to accomplish — basic queries of the weather and sports scores, calendar reminders, alarms, etc. That said, there are clear differences between the two in terms of the extent of their abilities. Siri: Siri is able to do more advanced queries like tell you the time difference between two cities or what the price of gasoline is in San Fransisco, typically drawing on resources like Wolfram Alpha and Wikipedia to answer, but in practice I’ve generally find it easier and more reliable to just Google the question. And most of Siri's functional advantages — things like opening up apps or sending iMessages — stem from the aforementioned platform advantage than any intrinsic usefulness to Siri itself. Assistant: Even with the limitations of iOS, Assistant gets a lot done. You can play videos in YouTube, add reminders and events through Google Calendar, and send emails through Gmail. Plus, there’s the usual AI assistant queries of stocks, the weather, and maps that’s common to both Siri and Assistant. Google has also tried its best to offer messaging and call support on iOS, but it can only get so far — both will get you 99 percent of the way there before passing you back to Apple’s apps for actually sending the message or placing a call. Meanwhile, things like setting an alarm just aren’t possible with Assistant on iOS, and others — like playing music, which shunts you over to YouTube — work, but are a bit of a hack. Google it can only get so far on iOS But even putting aside those similarities, Assistant has the entire power of Google’s Knowledge Graph behind it, which means that the breadth of information it can answer is wider than Siri’s. Also, Assistant just seems to work better in my experience when it comes to both understanding words and responding quickly. That said, some of the more impressive features of Assistant from Google I/O simply aren’t here yet. The impressive Google Lens augmented reality camera, or even simpler demos like the interactive Panera order seen on stage aren’t part of the app yet. Developer support Amazon has really led the way with developer supporter when it comes to Alexa, with over 10,000 different third-party skills available. Siri and Assistant both have some third-party support, but both companies could stand to take a page from Amazon's book here. Siri: Apple finally added third-party developer support for Siri with iOS 10, but it's still limited — developers can’t make Siri integrations for mapping or music apps, an intentional limitation that forces you to use Apple’s own Music and Maps services, even if you prefer Google and Spotify. Developers for Siri extensions are instead limited to seven categories of integration: ride book, messaging, photo search, payments, VoIP calling, workouts, and climate and radio. So even if you’d wanted to build a Siri extension to play Jeopardy or tell you how many people are in space right now, you can’t. Assistant: Google also took things slowly when it came to building out Google Assistant and Google Home's third-party abilities, but at I/O this year it opened the door for developers to make extensions for Assistant on both Home and phones. Plus, those actions won’t be targeted to specific devices — rather, if your hardware can support the skill (which could, say, require a screen to function), it’ll be able to access it. But it’s up to developers to actually build out the ecosystem. Task completion Answering questions and search is only half the equation, though. AIs also need to be able to actively do things for you, make your life easier. Neither platform is outstanding at this yet, but it’s definitely something to keep an eye on in the future both digital assistants continue to mature. Siri: Siri is a mixed bag when it comes to actually accomplishing tasks for you. In theory, you can look up restaurant reservations or movie times through OpenTable or Fandango, but it will still fall on you to actually complete the task yourself. Other things, like booking an Uber can be done entirely through Siri, as can sending money through Square Cash or Venmo, but that’s pretty much as far as it can go. Assistant: Like Siri, Assistant is also limited when it comes to actually doing things for you, at least for now, and some things that Siri can do — like summon an Uber — aren’t on Assistant for now. But, as mentioned before, Google has high hopes for what can eventually be done with assistant, like sending flowers or ordering lunch, but right now things are still extremely limited on an iPhone. But if Google (and the third party developers it needs to jump on board) can actually ship some of the integrations shown off at I/O this year, Assistant could get a huge leg up on Siri. Directly comparing any third party AI assistant — whether from Google, Microsoft, or another company — to Siri is always going to be a tough proposition, given how locked down iOS is on a system level and Apple’s tight control over the platform. Siri — while still not great — is good enough for now As things stand right now, between Siri’s advantages when it comes to native integration to things like messaging and music, along with the system-wide availability that makes it accessible at any time means that in most cases, it’s easier to use Apple’s assistant. While Assistant does clearly best Siri when it comes to overall knowledge and support for Google services, (including Maps) the current implementation just isn’t so dramatically better at these tasks that it’s worth the extra inconvenience of working around Apple’s sandboxing. That said, Google does have some seriously impressive ambitions for Assistant that could shift the scales in its favor. But those features aren’t here yet, and for what Assistant can do on iOS now, Siri — while not great — is good enough.

 A 7-year-old girl asked Google for a job and got a personal response from CEO Sundar Pichai Matt Weinberger Feb. 15, 2017, 2:03 PM 987,975 facebook linkedin twitter email print Chloe Bridgewater, who lives in Hereford, England, has a little more drive than most 7-year-olds. Fascinated by her Kindle Fire tablet and robots — and totally taken by the idea of working somewhere with bean-bag chairs, go-karts, and slides — Chloe decided to apply for a job at Google. Here's Chloe's letter, shared with Business Insider by her father, Andy Bridgewater: Andy Bridgewater Super cute, right? Imagine her surprise and delight when she got a letter back from the CEO of Google, Sundar Pichai, who encouraged her to follow her dreams. "I look forward to receiving your job application when you are finished with school! :)" he wrote. Take a look at the letter, shared in a viral LinkedIn post by Andy earlier this week: Andy Bridgewater (Business Insider has confirmed the veracity of the letter.) In that LinkedIn post, Andy said the letter was a much-needed confidence booster for Chloe, who was "knocked down" by a car years ago. Chloe Bridgewater with her dad, Andy. Andy Bridgewater Chloe's fascination with Google began recently, Andy told Business Insider, when she asked her father where his ideal place to work would be. Andy currently works in sales for a refrigeration-system parts manufacturer. "And I said, 'Oh, Google would be a nice place to work,'" he said, because of its world-famous perks and the cutting-edge work it does. When Chloe decided she wanted to work there, too, her father encouraged her to apply and "get the ball rolling," he said. All the attention garnered from Pichai's response has redoubled Chloe's drive to work for Google. Andy says his daughter now wants to find a way into the Silicon Valley-based company through going on TV and talking to the media. He's largely resisted, though, saying he wants her to focus on her studies and develop her skills. But Andy wants to brush up on his own technological skills to catch up with Chloe. "Sadly, I think I've got to up my game," he said. Get the latest Google stock price here.

Mark Savage, who ran as an independent in Swords, Co Dublin, in the last elections told the High Court Google's treatment of him was part of the internet giant's own "worldwide campaign in support of LGBT issues and I take that as discrimination against me". Google was not responsive to his "take down" request in relation to the homophobe claims because of his religious beliefs and "my disapproval for gay marriage, gay lifestyle and inappropriate behaviour".  Mr Savage is opposing an appeal by the Data Protection Commissioner and Google over a Circuit Court decision in favour of Mr Savage's application that internet threads relating to the homophobe allegation should be taken down under "right to be forgotten" guidelines. He objects to a thread on Reddit describing him as “Mark Savage - North County Dublins (sic) homophobic candidate”. The thread arose from election leaflets handed out during his campaign referring to “gay perverts cavorting en flagrante on the beach on broad daylight”. If the Circuit Court ruling on the right to be forgotten in favour of Mr Savage is upheld, it will impose an “intolerable and unworkable” burden search engines, Google says. On the second day of the appeal before Mr Justice Michael White, Mr Savage, representing himself, argued the Circuit Court decision should stand. He said the refusal of the Data Protection Commissioner Helen Dixon to order Google to take down the thread showed a failure to comprehend a previous case where a take down order was made for a politician in the Labour Party which supported a yes vote in the gay marriage referendum. The politician, who he did not want to name, had made inappropriate replies to a constituent who had contacted him.  Ms Dixon treated Mr Savage less favourably than the politician, who succeeded in his take down request, because of his religious beliefs and opposition to gay marriage, he said. She basically took "almost verbatim" what Google had told her in her decision refusing a take down order for him, he said. He claimed she made her decision "as a favour to the political party because it supported a yes vote but was not going to to give it to this guy who was an election candidate in Swords because he was complaining about inappropriate behaviour by middle aged men on public beaches in front of young children in broad daylight". Responding to arguments from Cian Ferriter SC, for Google, in relation to the threads being opinions of people, Mr Savage said the effect of the Reddit thread was to present as a fact a matter which was based on an opinion.  A fact could not be based on an opinion under defamation law, he said. In relation to the discussion which occurred on this Reddit thread, Mr Savage said he had did not object to "ad hominem" abuse as he understood there was no right in law not to be offended.  But it was misleading, as Google had claimed, that the reason for permitting this thread was that it was a matter of public interest, he said. He "did not mind the abuse" but to call him a homophobe, which was not based on fact, was a different matter. He disputed Google's claim that the fact that the homophobe thread appeared on the first page of a search was the result of automatic word searching.  Even though there was more recent information about him, including newspaper articles, they did not come up before the Reddit thread, he said. The case resumes on Tuesday.

RSS ALL ARTICLES FEATURES ONLY Search How to Create Custom Shortcuts for Any Command With Google Home By Eric Ravenscraft on May 19th, 2017 Google Home can do a lot of really awesome stuff with voice commands, but some of them can get long and complicated. Now, you can create keyword shortcuts for any command that you use often, so you can save yourself time and breath while using Google Home. Google Home’s new shortcuts allow you to substitute a simple, short command for a longer, more complex one. For example, if you would usually say “Ok, Google, set office lights to 30%,” you can create a shortcut for this command to simply say “Ok, Google, time to work.” The latter is more conversational and takes less time. This is particularly helpful for Google’s third-party services where you have to add an extra layer. To talk to Stringify, for example, you have to say “Ok Google, ask Stringify good night” and Google will pass your command to Stringify. However, that’s a little awkward to say out loud, and it adds extra steps. However, you can set a shortcut so “Ok Google, good night” is interpreted as “ask Stringify good night.” To create a shortcut, open your Google Home app and tap the menu icon in the top left corner, then tap “More settings.”   Scroll down and tap Shortcuts. You’ll see a list of suggested shortcuts that you can automatically enable or customize. Alternatively, you can tap the blue plus icon at the bottom of the screen to create you’re on. We’ll do the latter for our example. In the first box, enter the shortcut command you want to use. Then, under “Google Assistant should do” enter the normal command you usually have to say. This can be any valid Google Home command. For example, I want to create a shortcut for my bed time Stringify Flow. So, in the first box, I’ve entered “good night” and then at the bottom, I’ve entered the full command, “ask Stringify good night.” It’s a good idea to test your command on Google Home without the shortcut to make sure it works the way you expect it to before adding the shortcut. Once you’re done, tap Save at the top of the screen. Once you’re finished, you’ll see your shortcut at the top of the page with a toggle. You can tap this toggle to turn each shortcut on or off without deleting it. This is particularly handy if you need to troubleshoot a shortcut. Each shortcut is limited to just one command, but you can always use services like IFTTT or Stringify to link multiple commands together and then run them from a single shortcut.

Build Apps 5x Faster For Half the Cost Enterprise Cloud Computing On Force.com Google Unveils Latest Tech Tricks as Computers Get Smarter By Michael Liedtke PUBLISHED: MAY 18 2017 Google's computer programs are gaining a better understanding of the world, and now it wants them to handle more of the decision-making for the billions of people who use its services. CEO Sundar Pichai [pictured above] and other top executives brought Google's audacious ambition into sharper focus Wednesday at an annual conference attended by more than 7,000 developers who design apps to work with its wide array of digital services. Among other things, Google unveiled new ways for its massive network of computers to identify images, as well as recommend, share, and organize photos. It also is launching an attempt to make its voice-controlled digital assistant more proactive and visual while expanding its audience to Apple's iPhone, where it will try to outwit an older peer, Siri. The push marks another step toward infusing nearly all of Google's products with some semblance of artificial intelligence -- the concept of writing software that enables computers to gradually learn to think more like humans. Google punctuated the theme near the end of the conference's keynote address by projecting the phrase, "Computing that works like we do." Pichai has made AI the foundation of his strategy since becoming Google's CEO in late 2015, emphasizing that technology is rapidly evolving from a "mobile-first" world, where smartphones steer the services that companies are building, to an "AI-first" world, where the computers supplement the users' brains. AI unnerves many people because it conjures images of computers eventually becoming smarter than humans and eventually running the world. That may sound like science fiction, but the threat is real enough to prompt warnings from respected technology leaders and scientists, including Tesla Motors CEO Elon Musk and Stephen Hawking. But Pichai and Google co-founder Larry Page, now CEO of Google corporate parent Alphabet Inc., see it differently. They believe computers can take over more of the tedious, grunt work so humans have more time to think about deeper things and enjoy their lives with friends and family. Other big tech companies, including Amazon.com, Microsoft, Apple and Facebook, also are making AI a top priority as they work on similar services to help users stay informed and manage their lives. Google believes it can lead the way in AI largely because it has built a gigantic network of data centers with billions of computers scattered around the world. This while people using its dominant internet search engine and leading email service have been feeding the machines valuable pieces of personal information for nearly 20 years. Now, Google is drawing upon that treasure trove to teach new tricks to its digital assistant, which debuted last year on its Pixel phone and an internet-connected speaker called Home that is trying to mount a challenge to Amazon's Echo. Google Assistant is on more than 100 million devices after being on the market for slightly more than six months and now is trying to invade new territory with a free app released Wednesday that works on the operating system powering Apple's iPhone. Previously, the assistant worked only on Google's Android software. Google's assistant will be at a disadvantage on the iPhone, though, because Siri -- a concierge that Apple introduced in 2011 -- is built into that device. A new service called Google Lens will give Assistant a new power. Lens uses AI to identify images viewed through a phone. For instance, point the phone at a flower and Assistant will call upon Lens to identify the type of flower. Or point the camera at the exterior of a restaurant and it will pull up reviews of the place. Pinterest has a similar tool. Also called Lens, it lets people point their cameras at real-world items and find out where to buy them, or find similar things online. Google Photos is adding a new tool that will prompt you to share photos you take of people you know. For instance, Photos will notice when you take a shot of a friend and nudge you to send it to her, so you don't forget. Google will also let you share whole photo libraries with others. Facebook has its own version of this feature in its Moments app. One potentially unsettling new feature in Photos will let you automatically share some or all of your photos with other people. Google maintains the feature will be smart enough so that you would auto-share only specific photos -- say, of your kids -- to your partner or a friend. Google is also adding a feature to Photos to create soft-cover and hard-cover albums of pictures at prices beginning at $9.99. The app will draw upon its AI powers to automatically pick out the best pictures to put in the album. © 2017 Associated Press under contract with NewsEdge/Acquire Media. All rights reserved.

Familiar By Barbara Ortutay PUBLISHED: MAY 19 2017 Google announced a lot of new bells and whistles Wednesday -- several of which, it turns out, are already offered by rivals such as Amazon, Apple and Facebook. These days, it's not unusual to find tech giants and their plucky startup rivals copying each other's tools and features -- sometimes improving on them and sometimes just playing catch-up. Echoing the Echo Google added features to its internet-connected Home speaker -- such as hands-free calling. That echoes Amazon's Echo speaker, which was released earlier and so has had more time to acquire a wider range of abilities. The new abilities announced Wednesday will also enable the Home speaker to control and interact with a variety of Whirlpool and Jenn-Air appliances later this year. For instance, you can ask the digital assistant within Home to turn on the dishwasher or set the temperature on the oven. This is already available on the Echo and other devices that use its Alexa assistant. Your Seeing Eye Google's new Lens tool is the stuff of science fiction. It lets people point their camera at things to find out more information about them. So if you see a flower, you can point your camera at it to find out its name. (The same, sadly, cannot be said for strangers you meet in a bar yet, unless he or she is a celebrity you didn't' recognize.) Samsung is trying some of that with its new Bixby Vision feature on the Galaxy S8 phones. Pinterest has a similar tool too. Also called Lens, it lets people point their cameras at real-world items and find out where to buy them, or find similar things online. Take a selfie, and you'll get similar hairstyle and makeup ideas (even if you aren't wearing any makeup). Slimming Down Though not a competitor, Google's slimmed-down phone operating system aimed at cheap Android phones is reminiscent of Facebook's own "skinny" version, called Facebook Lite. Both are aimed at getting more people to use the company's services, even if they live in developing countries and use cheap, older phones. Meeting Siri on Her Turf Google's digital assistant is hoping to outsmart Siri on Apple's iPhone. Google is releasing its voice-controlled assistant on a free app designed for iPhone's operating system -- basically competing with Apple's assistant on her own turf. The move extends the potential reach of Google's assistant, which debuted last fall on the company's Pixel phone and an internet-connected speaker called Home. Siri has come as a built-in service on iPhones since 2011; Google's assistant will require an app download. Both assistants can be summoned with a press of a button to answer questions, manage schedules and handle other routine tasks. Google believes its assistant can get people what they want more quickly because it draws upon the knowledge that the company has accumulated while running the world's most popular search engine. Siri, though, might have something to say about that. Photo Sharing Google says new tools will encourage sharing of photos that you might have meant to share, but maybe forgot. Google Photos will be able to suggest which photos to share and whom to share them with -- for example, if the person is in the photo. The company envisions a world in which amazing photos are no longer left on people's phones because other pressing things in life got in the way. Facebook has been trying to address this issue as well with its Moments app, which lets people share photos with friends and family privately, without posting them to a wider audience. © 2017 Associated Press under contract with NewsEdge/Acquire Media.
